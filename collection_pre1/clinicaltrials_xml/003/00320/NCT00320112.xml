	<brief_title>Improving Insulin Therapy With Enhanced Care Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : VA diabetes patient often difficulty manage self-care access clinic-based service ; many also lack social support help meet demand illness . Enhanced support especially important undertake sustain new challenge self-care task , initiate intensify insulin treatment regimen . Although VAs implement telephone nurse care management program support automated call service , many reluctant adopt model due nursing shortage . Objectives : This randomized trial evaluate intervention use low-cost interactive voice response ( IVR ) exchange system promote peer-to-peer communication among diabetes patient initiate increase insulin therapy medical guidance . The intervention base research demonstrate positive impact peer support chronic disease outcomes self-care behavior , prior study demonstrate effectiveness IVR-based self-management support VA diabetes patient , successful pilot study demonstrate VA diabetes patient ' willingness participate IVR-facilitated peer support . The Specific Aims : ( 1 ) To evaluate effect IVR-facilitated peer support diabetes patient ' glycemic control ( include A1c level , insulin dos , hypo- hyperglycemic symptom ) use VA care ; ( 2 ) To assess impact IVR-facilitated peer support patient-centered outcome , include patient ' satisfaction care , perceive social support , diabetes-specific quality life , self-care behavior ; ( 3 ) To identify patient characteristic associate participation use IVR peer support , mediator intervention 's impact patient outcome . Methods : 324 diabetes patient inadequate glycemic control candidate insulin initiation intensification recruit 2 VA facility ( Ann Arbor , Toledo ) . We pair eligible patient base age , gender , whether initiate increase insulin . Pairs randomize either : 1 ) usual care ; 2 ) usual care conjunction IVR-based peer support program . After orientation , intervention participant ask communicate weekly partner use IVR exchange . The IVR service design allow patient communicate without divulge home phone number , experience toll charge , responsible insure contact occur without assistance reminder prompt . Intervention patient achieve adequate glycemic control 6-month follow encourage select new treatment goal . Patients continue participate weekly IVR call 6 month . Research staff monitor process via Internet , outcomes measure six month . The primary endpoint HbA1c level 6 12-months . Secondary endpoint include physiological measure patient-centered outcome . The intervention design interact standard outpatient VA staffing model . We develop detailed training material facilitate implementation facility work clinical manager facilitate roll-out intervention find effective . Status : Recruitment participant complete well preliminary data analysis . 12 month data analyze .</detailed_description>
