	<brief_title>An Open-Label Study Compare Bleeding Profile Norelgestromin/Ethinyl Estradiol Extended Regimen Norelgestromin/Ethinyl Estradiol Given Traditional Regimen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol contraceptive patch show safe effective prevention pregnancy . The usual treatment regimen three consecutive seven-day patch follow one patch-free week . This cyclic method follow order mimic 28-day menstrual cycle . An extended contraceptive regimen ( administration active hormone great 21 day ) oral contraceptive common practice among woman wish delay prevent withdrawal bleed reason athletic participation go vacation . In addition convenience reduce frequency withdrawal bleeds , elimination hormone-free interval reportedly reduce many menstrually-related symptom ( headache , pelvic pain , breast tenderness , bloating , swell ) occur great frequency hormone-free interval rest cycle . Headache one common adverse effect associate hormonal contraceptive use . Studies demonstrate headache reduce subject use extended interval active hormone . However , one main side effect report extended regimen breakthrough bleed and/or spotting . Compared cyclic regimen , extend oral contraceptive use may associate increase incidence breakthrough bleeding spotting , especially first month use . This randomized ( patient assign different treatment base chance ) , open-label , multicenter study compare bleed profile norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol patch continuous regimen norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol patch cyclic regimen . Safety evaluation include adverse event reporting , physical examination , blood level , vital sign . The hypothesis study norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol extend regimen 84 day active hormone would result few day episode bleeding compare traditional cyclic regimen norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol . Patients receive norelgestromin/ethinyl estradiol patch plastic sleeve . In extended regimen patch apply weekly 12 consecutive week follow one week patch-free another three consecutive week weekly patch application . In cyclic regimen patch apply four consecutive cycle cycle consist three weekly patch application follow one week patch-free . The total duration treatment period 112 day regimen .</detailed_description>
