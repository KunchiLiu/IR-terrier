	<brief_summary>Primary objective : 1 . To determine overall tumor response rate oxaliplatin combination gemcitabine ( GEMOX ) first line second line therapy unknown primary cancer ( UPC ) . 2 . To determine tolerability ( toxicity ) regimen patient population . Secondary objective : 1 . To determine median overall survival ( OS ) time progression ( TTP ) patient treat combination . 2 . To determine impact combination quality life ( QOL ) patient population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Oxaliplatin chemotherapy drug cause death cancer cell actively divide cell interfere Deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) function . Gemcitabine prevent cell make DNA Ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) necessary cell growth , thus disrupt growth cancer cell , cause cancer cell start die . After screen portion study , eligible begin study treatment , come M. D. Anderson least every two week ( 14 day ) treatment . Each 14-day period treatment call `` cycle '' therapy . You receive least 3 cycle therapy ( 6 week ) unless side effect become intolerable disease progress . When begin treatment , small tube ( central venous line ) insert large vein skin chest vein arm administration oxaliplatin gemcitabine . The central venous line remain place entire time take part study . Both drug must give M. D. Anderson . On Day 1 cycle , receive gemcitabine inject vein 2 hour . On Day 2 cycle receive oxaliplatin inject vein 2 hour . This drug schedule repeat every 2 week . You first ask fill several questionnaire deal quality life . These help researcher understand study drug affect quality life include pain level , fatigue ( tiredness ) level , appetite , ability perform everyday task , spite whether shrinkage tumor . It take 30 minute hour complete form . You also ask complete questionnaire ( one time ) ask question decide take part study . During first cycle therapy , blood ( 2 1/2 teaspoon ) collect week routine test . Before new cycle therapy , complete physical exam , urine collect , blood drawn ( 2 Â½ teaspoon ) routine test . You ask tell study doctor medication take since start take study drug health problem may experience . You also either compute tomography ( CT ) scan Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) tumor ( ) every 6 week end study . All test new cycle treatment treatment stop must do M. D. Anderson . Extra test may do study doctor feel necessary care . Every 6 week long study , also ask fill questionnaire help study doctor understand quality life . It take 30 minute hour complete form . If experience intolerable side effect , treatment may delay , stop , may receive small dos treatment . You may continue receive treatment study , unless disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . If happens , take study doctor discus treatment option . When stop take part study reason , blood ( 3 teaspoon ) collect final routine test . You one physical exam either CT scan MRI check status disease . You also ask fill questionnaire help assess quality life . It take 30 minute hour complete form . Once stop receiving study treatment , contact phone every three month rest life check symptom may experience . This investigational study . Oxaliplatin FDA approve treatment advance cancer colon rectum , gemcitabine FDA approve treatment advanced cancer pancreas . However , combination two drug treatment cancer unknown primary still consider investigational . Up 81 people take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age &gt; /= 18 year old . 2 . Signed informed consent/authorization obtain prior conduct studyspecific screening procedure . 3 . Patients fulfill criterion UPC : primary detect complete evaluation define complete history physical , detailed laboratory examination , direct radiologic study , symptom sign direct invasive study , direct immunohistochemistry study serum tumor marker . 4 . Previously untreated receive one prior chemotherapy regimen unknown primary cancer . If patient previously treat , may previous exposure gemcitabine oxaliplatin . Prior exposure cisplatin carboplatin allow study . 5 . ECOG performance status must 02 ( Appendix A ) . 6 . Adequate hepatic , renal bone marrow function : Leukocytes &gt; = 3,000/uL ; Absolute neutrophil count &gt; = 1,500/uL ; Platelets &gt; = 100,000/uL ; Total bilirubin &lt; = 1.5 * institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; = 2.5 * institutional ULN ; Creatinine &lt; = 1.5 mg/dL . 7 . Women childbearing potential exclude study ; however participant ( men woman ) reproductive potential must practice effective method contraception study order minimize risk fetus . 8 . Patients may receive prior radiation treatment last fraction radiation treatment must complete least 4 week prior entry study . 9 . Patients must least one measurable lesion per RECIST Criteria accurately measure least one dimension , minimum lesion size equal twice thickness image study use . If radiation previously receive , measurable disease must occur outside previous radiation field , unless disease progression document . 10 . Both men woman member ethnic group eligible trial . 1 . In previously treat patient ; patient receive gemcitabine oxaliplatin one agent . 2 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia well control medication , myocardial infarction within previous 6 month , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 3 . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurological dysfunction would confound evaluation neurological adverse event . A CT scan brain need eligibility do patient present symptom suggestive brain metastasis . 4 . Patients chemotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 28 day earlier . 5 . Patients may receive investigational agent , participate investigational drug study within 28 day precede start study treatment . 6 . The teratogenic potential combination currently unknown . Women pregnant lactating exclude . 7 . History malignancy last 5 year , except patient prior history situ cancer basal squamous cell skin cancer eligible . 8 . Peripheral neuropathy &gt; grade 1 . 9 . Female patient adenocarcinoma axillary node exclude study .</criteria>
