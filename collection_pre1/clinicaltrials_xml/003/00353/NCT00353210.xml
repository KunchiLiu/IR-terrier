	<brief_summary>Human embryonic stem cell ( hESCs ) isolate early human embryo capability proliferate indefinitely culture develop nearly every cell human body . hESC important study developmental biology cell replacement therapy treatment degenerative human disease . An additional use embryonic stem cell would vitro study disease . hESC line derive embryos diagnose abnormal PGD test would afford model study . Because embryo test PGD find abnormal would rare circumstance transfer uterus woman ( case would discard ) , derivation new hESC line embryos would provide viable less ethically-objectionable source cell study mechanisms differentiation developmental biology .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Derivation Human Embryonic Stem Cell Lines From PGD Embryos</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Embryonic stem cell pluripotent cell derive early stage embryo ( blastocyst stage ) . Embryonic stem cell cell ability provide unlimited source daughter cell differentiate virtually cell body . Human embryonic stem cell line previously derive supernumerary embryo donate couple undergo IVF treatment . Thomson second world isolate human embryonic stem cell . We derive six human embryonic stem cell line , register National Institute Health eligible American federal funding research . We widely distribute cell line many researcher worldwide . The key feature human embryonic stem cell potential unlimited proliferation culture , ability differentiate large variety somatic cell body . Our group first show capability culture ( 1 ) . Our result , result group show human embryonic stem cell differentiate culture nerve cell , blood cell , pancreatic cell secrete insulin , heart muscle cell , others . Given key property human embryonic stem cell , expect far reach application basic scientific research , development new drug , may serve unlimited donor source cell transplantation . Embryonic stem cell recover human blastocyst donate stem cell research couple undergone preimplantation genetic diagnosis ( PGD ) embryos IVF . In PGD , number embryo generate routine IVF , cellular material take biopsy early human embryo culture vitro . Embryos find genetically normal selectively transfer uterus . A portion test embryos diagnosis find contain specific genetic mutation chromosomal aberration . After discussion couple subject consent , embryos implant potential mother purpose pregnancy . It note case uncertain diagnosis couple may elect transfer embryos perform prenatal diagnosis pregnancy termination case fetus find affected . Otherwise , affect embryo without certain diagnosis truly surplus embryo routinely discard . We wish derive human embryonic stem cell line embryos , since contain specific mutation chromosomal aberration interest research community . The genetically abnormal stem cell , derive PGD-tested embryo , useful tool investigation early development , cell function , disease progression , efficacy toxicity drug therapy genetic abnormality carry . Derivation human ES cell line harbor specific gene defect great importance study development treatment certain inheritable disorder . In addition , may employ development gene therapy strategy design potential treatment specific inherited disorder . It stress embryos recruit study would discard event , would implant produce child . The embryo , precious , contain suspect contain undesired chromosomal single gene defect , deem acceptable transfer couple undergoing IVF . By contrast , embryo , suitable purpose produce healthy offspring , valuable stem cell research key tool study specific human disorder , therapy , investigation early human development , derivation new medication treat disease , possibly correct genetic defect . Rather simply discard destroy stem cell within faulty embryo , salvage utilized derivation new disease-specific human embryonic stem cell line . Since new line derive PGD embryo utilized research purpose , derivation new embryonic stem cell line occur GLP condition , utilize predetermine acceptable raw material method . These line may characterize safety test like non-PGD-tested line manufacture Research Development Laboratory Goldyne Savad Institute Gene Therapy . The PGD-tested embryo obtain full informed consent prior utilization research . Voluntary donation embryos recruit , accordance exist regulation legislation . The donor approach decision discard genetically abnormal embryo independently make . IVF staff approach donor , answer question may , obtain permission prior utilization embryo . Because many ethical concern regard removal fetal cell human embryo , extremely sensitive moral debate `` right '' `` personage '' embryo . Once obtain , embryo develop blastocyst stage stem cell remove , accord accepted protocol human embryonic stem cell line development . No identifiable feature donor couple , exclusive know genetic mutation , attach embryos donate research .</detailed_description>
