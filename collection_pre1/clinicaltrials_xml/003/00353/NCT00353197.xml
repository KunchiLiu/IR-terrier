	<brief_summary>Human embryonic stem cell ( hESCs ) isolate early human embryo capability proliferate indefinitely culture develop nearly every cell human body . Therefore , hESCs may serve renewable unlimited source cell transplantation therapy . Because use animal product derivation , due lack appropriate quality process control manufacture exist cell line worldwide , exist hESC line suitable utilization transplantation therapy . Our objective derive several new hESC line suitable clinical trial . The investigator plan derive new hESC line utilize FDA-approved raw material non-animal culture system . They produce entirely GMP condition , use appropriately document procedure analytical method , completely safety test , screen infectious adventitious agent .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Derivation New Human Embryonic Stem Cell Lines Lines Clinical Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Embryonic stem ( ES ) cell line derive pluripotent cell early embryo . The key property ES cell ability proliferate indefinitely vitro without differentiation , capability give rise cell body . The recent derivation ES cell line human embryo ( Thomson et al. , 1998 , Reubinoff et al. , 2000 ) attract significant attention due remarkable potential cell basic scientific research , drug development , regenerative medicine . Since human embryonic stem cell ( hESCs ) capable unlimited self-renewal give rise specialize cell via differentiation , potentially use unlimited donor source cell transplantation variety disorder result loss cell cellular dysfunction . Among condition Parkinson 's disease , multiple sclerosis , traumatic spinal cord injury , diabetes , heart failure , liver failure , etc . It propose essential characteristic primate ES cell include ( ) derivation preimplantation periimplantation embryo , ( ii ) prolong undifferentiated proliferation , ( iii ) stable developmental potential form derivative three embryonic germ layer even prolonged culture ( Thomson , 1996 ) . The investigator derive stem cell line early human embryo meet criterion ( Reubinoff et al. , 2000 ) . Our group second world derive hESC line , first show potential undergo somatic differentiation vitro ( Reubinoff et al. , 2000 ) . To exploit remarkable potential hESCs , improvement currently use method culture manipulate cell well control differentiation require . In context , investigator develop novel approach cryopreserve ( Reubinoff et al. , 2001 ) , genetically modify ( Gropp et al. , 2003 ; Ben-Dor et al. , 2006 ) control differentiation hESCs cell ( Reubinoff et al. , 2001 , Itsykson et al. , 2005 ) . Human ES cell line derive embryos produce vitro fertilization ( IVF ) clinical purpose . Surplus frozen embryo longer required infertility treatment recruit purpose donor inform consent institutional/national review board approval obtain . The embryo thaw cultured blastocyst stage ( 5-6 day ) , inner cell mass ( ICM ) comprise pluripotent cell isolate , stem cell commonly culture mouse embryonic fibroblast feeder cell layer . The feeder layer require prevent differentiation promote proliferation stem cell . Most hESC line report worldwide date cell line currently list NIH registry derive mouse fibroblast feeder layer . The current line would suitable clinical use , screen donor reagent FDA compliant , presence mouse feeder render line xenotransplantation product . The regulatory compliance issue line raise make difficult obtain FDA approval human transplantation use . To eliminate use mouse feeder , undifferentiated hESCs successfully propagate laminin Matrigel-coated plastic surface presence mouse embryonic fibroblast-conditioned medium ( Xu et al 2001 ) . While system avoids direct contact mouse feeder hESCs , risk cross-transfer animal pathogens animal-conditioned medium hESCs avoid . During early day develop cell line , investigator successfully cultivate hESCs human feeder . Subsequently , Richards colleges demonstrate human fetal adult feeder support prolong undifferentiated propagation exist hESC line superior cell-free matrix supplement human mouse feeder-conditioned medium . They also report derivation new hESC line use human embryonic fibroblast animal-free culture condition ( Richards et al. , 2002 ) . The potential use human placenta foreskin-derived feeder develop support undifferentiated propagation hESCs also demonstrate ( Genbacev et al. , 2005 ; Amit et al. , 2003 ) . Maintenance culture undifferentiated hESCs absence feeder recently report . It show combination LIF , basic fibroblast growth factor , transform growth factor Beta1 support undifferentiated proliferation hESCs fibronectin ( Amit et al. , 2004 ) . The activation Wnt signal system also suggest promote maintenance pluripotent hESCs absence feeder ( Sato et al. , 2004 ) . Furthermore , suggest substitute medium high concentration FGF2 noggin sufficient support propagation hESCs without feeder ( Xu et al. , 2005 ) . In addition , feeder-free undifferentiated propagation hESCs colony report chemically-defined medium without serum replacer , supplement activin nodal plus FGF2 ( Vallier er al. , 2005 ) . Lastly derivation propagation hESCs animal free , chemically-defined , feeder-free culture system presence high concentration FGF2 report ( Ludwig et al. , 2006 ) . So far , development hESC condition allow future use transplantation therapy report . In second half project , investigator propose continue effort develop new clinical-grade hESC line derive totally FDA-approved raw material non-animal culture system . The mouse feeder replace primary cell line human fibroblast . In first part project , investigator complete development master cell bank ( MCBs ) clinical-grade human fibroblast feeder . These feeder produce entirely GMP condition within Hadassah Vector Production Facility , use animal-free , FDA-approved raw material ( detail see Results section ) . To best knowledge , development GMP clinical-grade human feeder report group . In parallel , investigator modify method derivation culture hESCs . The investigator develop novel animal-free method isolation pluripotent stem cell human IVF embryo successfully use method derivation new hESC line . The replacement animal product FDA non-approved material humanize recombinant clinical-grade material hESC culture system near completion . Validation efficacy modify culture system ongoing . Preliminary result suggest modified culture system efficiently support undifferentiated cultivation hESCs . The newly-derived clinical-grade hESC line derive use embryo couple entirely screen accord organ donation blood donation guideline regulation ( per FDA propose rule donor suitability ) . In first year , investigator complete recruitment 14 embryos three couple . Donor medical history review , screen blood swab test result obtain documented . Samples donor couple blood archive retrospective testing lock storage facility . Recruitment additional embryo ongoing . Upon completion characterization safety test new human feeder , expand work lot , validation efficacy clinical grade-culture system hESCs , investigator develop new hESC line Hadassah University Hospital Vector Production Facility , whereby stringent quality control environmental testing maintain . All work accomplish utilizing raw material approve Quality Assurance Program , provide vendor underwent strict vendor approval/review process . The production work perform use technique adhere good manufacturing practice ( GMPs ) good tissue practice ( GTPs ) . Early passage hESCs feeder ( Master Cell Bank ) submit phenotypic latent agent test , endotoxin analysis , test viral adventitious agent contamination . The Working Cell Bank feeder hESCs also test phenotypic characterization , reproducibility , sterility , mycoplasma , detection latent agent , endotoxin . The final product retested per Master Cell Bank , . By conclusion manufacture test process , Hadassah 's Stem Cell Program provide generic commercial product . The procedure method investigator develop instrumental tool stem cell researcher , thus pave way future stem cell research Israel worldwide . The commercial potential product allow production specific cell clinical use ; widespread commercial value enormous market worth .</detailed_description>
