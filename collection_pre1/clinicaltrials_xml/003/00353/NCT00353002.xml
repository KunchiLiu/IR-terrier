	<brief_title>A Comparison Amethocaine Cream vs. Liposomal Lidocaine Cream Venipuncture Children .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children commonly require blood take placement intravenous line diagnosis treatment visit emergency department . The distress needle puncture particular issue child . The development needle phobia subsequently adversely affect well-being child relationship medical staff . Thus reduction pain distress would beneficial patient , parent , medical personnel . Amethocaine ( tetracaine 4 % ) ( Ametop ) another topical anaesthetic cream market Canada last 10 year ; develop Dr. David Wollfson Queen 's University , Belfast , cream available 1.5g tube delivers 1 dose , cost ( $ 3.24 ) . structurally ester type bond ( Para-amino benzoic acid ) formulate free base allow tetracaine diffuse across skin barrier reach pain receptor ( nociceptors ) locate stratum corneum ( out layer skin ) . It act inhibit sodium ion flux across axon membrane thus prevent nociceptors signal pain central nervous system . The application time require cream 30 minute , possess action time 4 hour removal skin . Also Amethocaine low risk methemoglobinemia , therefore use safely neonatal period disadvantage Amethocaine cream skin erythema due vasodilatation effect . Liposomal lidocaine 4 % cream ( Maxilene , RGR Pharma , Windsor , Ontario ) another anaesthetic cream launch recently Canada 2003 . And 5 gm tube price 15 $ . The liposome-encapsulated formulation protect anesthetic metabolized quickly ( 12 ) It short onset action minimal vasoactive property minimize potential interference cannulation success , associate methemoglobinemia . As yet , study do child Emergency Department set compare efficacy side effect Liposomal Lidocaine cream Amethocaine cream . Thus , evidence guiding use agent Paediatric Emergency care set , Furthermore use cream consider standard care child Canada , usual clinical practice Canadian emergency department use local anesthesia cream IV insertion blood extraction . Thus , positive result study could directly apply change care child acute emergency care set . Both cream show considerable potential alleviating procedure pain , cream also cause skin effect , thus may affect success rate procedure . Therefore would like test two cream demonstrate efficacy two cream control pain . As Liposomal Lidocaine believe few side skin effect Amethocaine , â€™ possible success rate may better Liposomal Lidocaine Amethocaine cream thus would prefer agent use child Emergency acute care set .</detailed_description>
