Eligible patient adult type 2 diabetes take intermediate- and/or long-acting insulin pre-mixed ( e.g. , `` 70/30 '' ) insulin , combination insulin one two non-TZD hypoglycemic agent include sulfonylurea , metformin , acrabose Byetta , poorly control exist therapy . Preference enrollment give patient insulin monotherapy . Patients treated combination insulin hypoglycemic agent ( ) must willing able discontinue washout hypoglycemic agent ( ) entire duration study ( toto , approximately 28 week ) . Patients take fixed dos short-acting insulin ( e.g. , `` slide scale '' ) combination intermediate-acting insulin may qualify study patient investigator willing either change pre-mixed insulin ( e.g. , 70/30 ) discontinue use short act insulin least 26 week .
