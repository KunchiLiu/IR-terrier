	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL Prevention Contrast Nephropathy Sodium Bicarbonate Versus Sodium Chloride N-Acetylcysteine Nephrology Cardiology Services , Shaare Zedek Medical Center , Jerusalem 1 . Background rationale The development acute renal failure follow cardiac catheterization recognize since 1970 's . The syndrome acute renal failure follow cardiac catheterization presently felt due either atheroembolic disease refer contrast induced nephropathy . Since clinical course different , usually difficult diagnose acute contrast induce nephropathy . All protocols prevent contrast nephropathy include infusion sodium chloride without oral N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) pretreatment , although several recent meta-analyses raise doubt efficacy . Review Shaare Zedek Medical Center experience 2000 thru 2003 demonstrate significant decrease incidence acute contrast induce nephropathy cardiac catheterization follow introduction routine NAC usage . This effect detect patient mild renal insufficiency ( creatinine le 1.5mg/dl ) . Patients high plasma creatinines appear benefit NAC prophylaxis . A recent study demonstrate preventive hydration sodium bicarbonate effective sodium chloride patient undergo radiographic procedure . However , study , subdivision patient severity kidney disease clear sodium bicarbonate effective patient severe kidney disease milder renal impairment . In addition rate , duration kind fluid use preventive hydration differ currently recommend . Because free radical postulate mediate contrast induce nephropathy formation promote acidic environment , alkalinize renal tubular fluid bicarbonate may reduce renal injury reduce free radial formation . NAC also know free radical scavenger since compound relatively ineffective prevent contrast nephropathy patient moderate severe renal impairment ( plasma creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg % ) , postulate sodium bicarbonate may effective prevention contrast nephropathy high risk patient . The propose study design test efficacy preventive hydration sodium bicarbonate versus sodium chloride oral NAC pretreatment patient stable advanced renal insufficiency ( CKD stage 3 4-GFR 15-60ml/min/1.73m2 calculate MDRD formula ) undergo cardiac catheterization . 2 . Study objectives The objective study assess efficacy sodium bicarbonate compare sodium chloride NACpretreatment prevention contrast nephropathy patient advance renal disease . 3 . Outcome measure The incidence contrast induce nephropathy , define 25 % increase serum creatinine within 2 day contrast administration , assess . 4 . Study design This prospective , randomize , single center trial . Patients due undergo cardiac catheterization either electively follow acute coronary syndrome eligible inclusion . Elective patient admit day procedure . After baseline assessment laboratory test , randomly assign one two group . One group receive 12 hour infusion 154 meq/l ( 0.9 % ) sodium chloride rate 1ml/kg per hour cardiac catheterization NAC 600mg x 2/d PO day day procedure . The second group receive 154meq/l sodium bicarbonate 5 % dextrose water mixed nursing staff add 154 ml 1000 meq/l sodium bicarbonate 846 ml 5 % dextrose water , slightly dilute dextrose concentration 4.23 % .The initial IV bolus 3 ml/kg one hour cardiac catheterization . Following bolus , patient receive fluid rate 1 ml/kg per hour contrast exposure 6 hour procedure . A basic panel blood chemistry ( Na , K , Cl , Ca , P , BUN , creatinine , total protein , albumin , complete blood count , pH , HCO3 , pCO2 O2 sit ) obtain procedure post-procedure day 1 2 increase serum creatinine resolve . GFR calculate MDRD formula patient cardiac catheterization . 5 . Patient selection Patients identify study candidate base preliminary laboratory test result . They refer clinic Shaare Zedek , Kupot Cholim inpatient service Shaare Zedek Medical Center . Eligible patient include individual age 18 year old GFR 15-60ml/min calculate MDRD formula , schedule undergo cardiac catheterization . During randomized study , consecutive eligible patient schedule exposure nonionic radiographic contrast agent iopamidol ( 796 mOsm/kg H2O , 755 mg iopamidol per milliliter , 370 mg iodine per milliliter ) consider enrollment . 6 . Exclusion criterion i. Serum creatinine level 8mg/dl GFR less 15ml/min ii . Change serum creatinine level Â³0.5mg/dl previous 24 hour . iii . Preexisting dialysis iv . Multiple myeloma . v. Pulmonary edema . vi . Uncontrolled hypertension ( treat systolic blood pressure 160 mmHg , diastolic blood pressure 100mmHg . ) vii . Emergency catheterization . viii . Recent exposure radiographic contrast ( within two day study ) . ix . Allergy radiocontrast . x. Pregnancy . xi . Administration dopamine , mannitol NAC study . 7 . Blinding The study completely blind . The serum creatinine level determine fully blind fashion laboratory personnel . The investigator Nephrology service analyze laboratory data without knowledge patient study group . The patient know group randomize . The investigator Cardiology service know patient study group , analyze patient laboratory test result . 8 . Study Methods Qualified patient agree enter study assign 1 2 treatment group base computer-generated randomization schedule . Patients allocate sodium chloride-NAC group receive 154mEq/L sodium chloride rate 1ml/kg per hour 12 hour cardiac catheterization NAC 600mgx2/d PO day day procedure . Patients allocate sodium bicarbonate group receive 154 mEq/L sodium bicarbonate dextrose H2O , mixed Nursing Service add 154 mL 1000 mEq/L sodium bicarbonate 846 mL 5 % dextrose H2O , slightly dilute dextrose concentration 4.23 % . After appropriate nursing evaluation initial measurement blood pressure weight , pre-contrast fluid administer . Patients allocate sodium chloride-NACgroup receive 154 mEq/L sodium chloride rate 1ml/kg per hour 12 hour cardiac catheterization NAC 600mgx2/d PO day day procedure The initial intravenous bolus NaHCO3 group 3 mL/kg per hour 1 hour immediately radiocontrast injection . Following , patient receive fluid rate 1 mL/kg per hour contrast exposure 6 hour procedure . For patient weigh 110 kg , initial fluid bolus drip limited dos administer patient weigh 110 kg . Diuretics routinely withhold day contrast injection . A basic panel blood chemistry ( Na , K , Cl , Ca , P , BUN , creatinine , total protein , albumin , complete blood count , serum pH , HCO3 , pCO2 O2 sit ) ) obtain procedure post-procedure day 1 2 increase serum creatinine resolve . GFR calculate MDRD formula procedure . 9 . Study End Points Statistical Analysis The primary outcome measure development contrast-induced nephropathy , define increase serum creatinine 25 % within 2 day cardiac catheterization . This definition identical use recent large meta-analysis contrast-induced nephropathy . Post-contrast creatinine assess morning day 1 2 . The high serum creatinine post-contrast day 1 2 used calculate change serum creatinine ( primary end point ) . Before begin study , estimate sample size need primary end point contrast-induced nephropathy . Based previous data , assume development contrast-induced renal failure 15 % sodium chloride-NAC group 5 % sodium bicarbonate group . Analysis indicate sample size 281 patient would require detect statistically significant difference power 80 % ( two tail p = 0.05 ) . Tests significance conduct use test continuous variable c2 Fisher exact test categorical variable . All analysis conduct use SAS software version 8.2 ( SAS Institute Inc , Cary , NC ) . Data express mean ( SD ) . All test 2-tailed , difference report significant p &lt; 0.05 . 10 . Feasibility study The average number cardiac catheterization perform Shaare Zedek Medical Center 25-30 procedure per week . A recent review 30 consecutive cardiac catheterization patient show 8 would eligible enrollment protocol . Thus , take 10-12 month enroll require number patient . 11 . Safety The infusion sodium bicarbonate sodium chloride safe . In published sodium bicarbonate study bolus administration hydration fluid cause moderate increase systolic diastolic blood pressure ( mean 11mm Hg sodium chloride group 14 mmHg sodium bicarbonate group . ) No patient develop clinical heart failure respiratory distress . Since patient enrol study control hypertension ( patient blood pressure 160/100 exclude ) mild elevation blood pressure problematic . 12 . Study significance Contrast induce nephropathy common complication cardiac catheterization . Prophylactic hydration sodium chloride NAC currently use less effective patient advance renal disease observe incidence acute contrast induce nephropathy approximately 15 % . In addition use regimen require preventive hospitalization may especially problematic patient chronic kidney disease require urgent cardiac catheterization . If preventive hydration sodium bicarbonate effective well currently use saline-NAC regimen , pretreatment time cardiac catheterization could significantly shorten , hence permit usage emergent procedure . Since emergent procedure preclude use current relatively long pretreatment regimen , bicarbonate could reduce incidence acute contrast induce nephropathy highly vulnerable group .</detailed_description>
