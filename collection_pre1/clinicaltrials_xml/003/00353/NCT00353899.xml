	<brief_summary>This study examine way establish standardize normal measurement child , specific gender , age , body surface , use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . MRI , introduce 1980s , use frequently child . In study , researcher seek understand child 's heart different adult , MRI use test . More child congenital heart disease living longer . Researchers look good way assess cardiac anatomy function , compare finding normal function . Patients age 8 21 good health smoke may eligible study . There blood urine test check pregnancy female volunteer begin menstruate age 12 . Pregnancy test result must negative patient stay study . The MRI technique use strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image body organ tissue . For procedure , patient lie still table slide enclose tunnel scanner . They scanner 20 60 minute . As scanner take picture , patient hear knock beep sound , wear earplugs reduce noise . Patients able communicate MRI staff time scan . At time , patient parent may ask patient move machine . If would like , patient bring music CD listen radio station headphone . Some MRI technique require monitoring patient undergoing scan . For monitor heart , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) perform make sure heart rhythm normal heart disease present . Patients may ask wear adhesive patch attach wire EKG machine chest . To monitor breathing , patient may ask wear rubber belt stretch take breath . So best quality image produce , patient may ask hold breath 15 second . During MRI scan , patient may experience peripheral nerve stimulation , usually experienced muscle twitch . It cause rapid switching magnetic field serious . Patients feel muscle twitch report sensation person perform scan . It possible , though unlikely , painful sensation result nerve stimulation . Patients immediately report pain scan stop .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging Pediatric Normal Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A cardiac MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) scan perform normal child young adult volunteer . These study conduct MRI system locate NIH Clinical Center Bethesda , Maryland . The result use establish normal standard MRI measurement pediatric population ; include leave ventricular mass , ejection fraction standard cardiac measurement .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Any normal volunteer age 8 21 year old , nonsmoker capable give assent legal guardian give inform consent 18 year old . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : A subject exclude he/she contraindication MR scanning . 1 . Brain aneurysm clip 2 . Implanted neural stimulator 3 . Implanted cardiac pacemaker defibrillator 4 . Cochlear implant 5 . Ocular foreign body ( e.g . metal shaving ) 6 . Insulin pump &lt; TAB &gt; To assess whether subject indeed normal , legal guardian ask fill questionnaire . Subjects also exclude paralyzed hemidiaphragm , morbid obesity ( BMI great 30 % ) , claustrophobia , smoker , significant asthma ( great one asthma attack per month past three month ) , pregnancy , major medical illness require regular medication ( steroid may alter muscle mass , sickle cell disease , thalassemia ) , history cardiac disease ( require SBE prophylaxis visit dentist ) , and/or history significant previous surgery may alter cardiac anatomy ( diaphragmatic hernia , tracheoesophageal fistula ) . Females menstruate age receive pregnancy test part screen process participate protocol . If wish test , participate voluntary protocol .</criteria>
