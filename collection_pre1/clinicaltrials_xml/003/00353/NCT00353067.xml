	<brief_title>Veliflapon ( DG-031 ) Prevent Heart Attacks Stroke Patients With History Heart Attack Unstable Angina</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Genetic linkage association study Icelandic patient history myocardial infarction stroke show common haplotype two gene , 5-lipoxygenase activate protein ( FLAP ) Leukotriene A4 Hydrolase ( LTA4H ) , confer significant risk MI stroke . The FLAP haplotype RR 1.8 MI 2.1 MI stroke . LTA4H haplotype RR 1.1 MI 1.5 MI stroke.Both gene association replicate European US Caucasian group independent conventional risk factor LDL-cholesterol , hypertension , diabetes . The haplotype LTA4H pathway show modest relative risk 1.2 US Caucasian cohort MI 1.4 MI stroke . However , LTA4H haplotype much higher relative risk 3.5 myocardial infarction African-Americans ( p=0.000022 ) . Self identified African American patient acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) select study population high risk identify date develop MI related HapK genetic variant leukotriene pathway . The study enrich include African American patient randomize algorithm design assure approximately 80 % study population Hap K positive 20 % Hap K positive result . All patient screen eligibility base haplotype status . Patients randomize either veliflapon placebo top standard care . Patients randomize within 5-30 day ACS event . This event drive study time first occurrence follow element : hospitalization UA urgent revascularization , fatal/non-fatal MI , fatal/non-fatal stroke CV relate death comprise primary endpoint . The primary null hypothesis efficacy time first CV event among African American patient positive LTA4H HapK Variant assay test different placebo either give addition standard care therapy . A total 3450 eligible patient randomize study . The treatment duration patient enrol study target least 6 month ( base approximate time last patient enrol ) 36 month ( first patient enrol ) . All cardiac clinical event endpoint adjudicate independent Clinical Endpoint Committee ( CEC ) .</detailed_description>
