	<brief_title>An Observational Study Cough / Lower Respiratory Tract Infection ( LRTI ) Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GRACE Network Excellence focus complex controversial field community-acquired low respiratory tract infection ( LRTI ) , one lead reason seek medical care . It fund Funding Program 6 European Union . The prescription antibiotic LRTI account major proportion antibiotic use community , contribute rise prevalence resistance among major human pathogen . The overall objective GRACE combat antimicrobial resistance integrate centre research excellence exploit genomics investigation management community-acquired LRTI The first study undertaken part GRACE GRACE-01 , observational study , aim describe presentation , management ( evaluation treatment decision ) outcomes people cough / chest infection general medical practice 13 primary care network Europe . This observational study current practice involve experimental procedure intervention . Other objective Of GRACE-01 : 1 . To describe variation management cough / chest infection include antibiotic prescribing primary care , within , select European country order explain good practice could make explicit generalise . 2 . To identify priority intervention study aim enhance antibiotic prescribe community acquire cough / chest infection aspect management . 3 . To contribute develop intervention aim enhance antibiotic prescribing aspect management community-acquired cough / chest infection applicable across European Union ( EU ) , also intervention relevant unique local situation within Europe . There two recruitment period , one begin second October 2006 soon thereafter second begin first February 2007 soon thereafter . The goal 13 participate European network recruit total 150 patient recruitment period .</detailed_description>
