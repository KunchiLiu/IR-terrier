	<brief_summary>This study examine whether exposure organochlorines ( certain chemical PCBs DDE , use pesticide industrial application ) relate age natural menopause . It known , example , smoker experience menopause 1 2 year earlier non-smokers . This study look similar association organochlorine exposure menopause . It also look possible association specific factor , pregnancy history weight change , change time blood organochlorine level . Women participate North Carolina Infant Feeding Study 1978 1982 eligible study . Participants interview phone information reproductive menstrual history , well additional information may relate age menopausal status . Specifically , interview cover follow area : 1 ) pregnancy breastfeed history ; 2 ) menstrual period menopause ; 3 ) use birth control pills hormone replacement therapy ; 4 ) surgery uterus ovary , hysterectomy oophorectomy , ; 5 ) smoke alcoholic beverage consumption ; 6 ) physical activity ; 7 ) weight history ; 8 ) medical history .

	<detailed_description>Smoking show many study associate 1-2 year decrease age natural menopause . However , relatively little known effect potential toxicant , include organochlorines polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , 1 , 1 dichloro-2,2-bis ( p-chlorophenyl ) ethylene ( p , p -DDE , refer subsequently DDE ) . We assess time menopause among woman participate North Carolina Infant Feeding Study ( total n = 865 ) . Recruitment study conduct 1978 1982 . PCB DDE level analyze blood breast milk sample around delivery pregnancy . The median age woman March , 2002 , 50 year . Data collect telephone interview focus reproductive menstrual history additional information collect demographic , social behavioral factor could affect time menopause . A blood sample collect approximately 50 % participant base sample stratum involve criterion relate age menopausal status . Follicle stimulate hormone luteinizing hormone measure sample order classify menopausal status woman undergone hysterectomy retention least one ovary , woman currently use hormone replacement therapy whose use begin still period , woman report short , long , irregular menstrual cycle length past 12 month . PCB DDE level also determine sample , allow u assess correlation current baseline ( 1978-1982 ) PCB DDE measure . The purpose study ass association baseline organochlorine measurement time natural menopause . A secondary aim conduct exploratory analyse association specific factor ( e.g. , pregnancy history , weight change ) rate change organochlorine level .</detailed_description>
