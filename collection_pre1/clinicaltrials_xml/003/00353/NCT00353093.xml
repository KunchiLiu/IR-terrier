	<brief_summary>Currently , patient suspect deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) low extremity receive ultrasound investigation deep vein system , either limited ultrasonography ( ultrasonography confine proximal vein , repeat test one week patient positive D-dimer ) extend ultrasonography ( ultrasonography extented entire deep vein system leg ) . No study directly compare two strategy assess accuracy safety . We plan compare accuracy safety two strategy prospective randomize study address 2000 consecutive outpatient present clinical suspicion DVT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The ERASMUS Study : Limited v Extended US DVT Diagnosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All consecutive outpatient refer study center clinically suspect deep vein thrombosis potentially eligible inclusion . Patients exclude history previous venous thromboembolism , clinical suspicion pulmonary embolism , life expectancy short 3 month , use therapeutic dos unfractionated heparin , low molecular weight heparin oral anticoagulant 48 hour , another indication anticoagulant treatment , pregnant , age less 18 year , inaccessible follow-up , refuse participation study . Randomization Before randomization , patient interview use standardized questionnaire order collect information risk factor venous thrombosis , presence several clinical sign symptom . Subsequently , randomize limited extend ultrasound strategy computer generate list , 100 patient arrange balanced block 10 , specific center . The list accessible study nurse inform study physician group allocation patient provide informed consent . Initial diagnostic workup Patients randomize limited ultrasonography undergo compression ultrasonography , confine investigation common femoral popliteal vein trifurcation . In patient normal finding D-dimer testing perform , subsequently manage accord result : patient normal D-dimer level receive investigation , abnormal test schedule repeat compression ultrasonography within one week . Patients randomize extended ultrasonography receive first evaluation proximal vein system , include common femoral , superficial femoral popliteal vein trifurcation . Then patient compressible proximal vein undergo extensive evaluation calf vein system , include anterior tibial , posterior tibial peroneal vein , , deep vein normal , also muscular ( gastrocnemial soleal ) vein . Limited ultrasonography D-dimer The common femoral groin , popliteal vein branch calf deep vein popliteal fossa , examine transverse plane , 7.5 MHz linear probe . The test result categorize normal ( compressible vein ) abnormal ( non compressible vein ) . We use rapid whole blood bedside D-dimer assay ( SimpliRED® D-Dimer assay , AGEN Biomedical Ltd. , Brisbane Australia ) . This assay base autologous red cell agglutination , use chemical conjugate monoclonal antibody specific human D-dimer ( DD-3B6/22 ) link monoclonal antibody bind surface human red blood cell ( RAT-1C3/86 ) active agent . The test perform either capillary citrate venous blood . Agglutination occur D-dimer concentration 0.2 mg/L . The SimpliRED® result categorize normal , abnormal non interpretable . The latter find categorized abnormal . Extended ultrasonography All vein image along length 7.5 MHz linear transducer . The proximal venous system examine start ( common superficial ) femoral vein , scan distal part thigh , patient lie supine . Then , patient prone position popliteal vein trifurcation evaluate . The calf vein evaluate patient sit his/her leg hang edge bed . Starting proximal venous segment downwards , anterior , posterior tibial peroneal vein visualize along length , employ augmentation maneuver ( manual squeezing distal calf foot ) enhance vessel visualization . The approach use image muscular vein . The criterion adjudicate thrombosis involve proximal system tibial peroneal vein find non compressible venous segment . As muscular vein , criterion abnormal test incompressibility lack spontaneous intraluminal color fill reverse-flow color fill augmentation maneuver . All test perform highly skilled physician . Follow-up All patient initial normal workup discourage receive antithrombotic drug , schedule clinical evaluation three month . They instruct immediately contact study center symptoms venous thromboembolism become manifest meantime . In case undergo instrumental test confirm refute presence disease . Patients fail attend schedule visit contact telephone ass status , invite attend clinical evaluation study centre . Outcomes The primary outcome study : ( 1 ) prevalence location venous thrombosis show initial diagnostic workup ; ( 2 ) rate symptomatic venous thromboembolic event ( include proximal vein thrombosis , isolated thrombosis tibial peroneal vein either leg , pulmonary embolism ) three month follow patient initially normal diagnostic workup . All suspect event objectively evaluate follow : ipsilateral contralateral deep vein thrombosis rule abnormal compression ultrasonography find intraluminal filling defect ascend venography , visible two different projection ; suspect pulmonary embolism confirm abnormal spiral compute tomography lung , high probability ventilation-perfusion lung scan , abnormal pulmonary angiography . Fatal pulmonary embolism adjudicate finding autopsy , case sudden otherwise inexplicable death , clinical ground accord opinion independent physician . An independent blind committee adjudicates suspect thromboembolic event death occur follow base relevant document footage .</detailed_description>
