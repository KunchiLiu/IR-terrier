	<brief_summary>This study evaluate safety effectiveness new vaccine , ALVAC-pp65 , boost immunity cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) infection stem cell transplant donor . CMV member herpesvirus group , include herpes simplex virus type 1 2 , varicella-zoster virus ( cause chickenpox ) , Epstein-Barr virus ( cause infectious mononucleosis ) . Most adult infect CMV , healthy immune system keep virus check , cause harm . In people weaken immune system , transplant recipient , virus become reactivate . Medications treat infection may cause low blood count kidney damage , , case , virus may cause death . The ALVAC-pp65 vaccine intend improve immunity CMV stem cell donor thereby prevent reactivation recipient . It make virus ordinarily infect canary . The virus weaken infect person receives , modify carry copy CMV gene call pp65 . This gene instruct cell make CMV protein vaccine recipient 's immune system produce antibody , thus confer immunity disease . Persons 18 year age old schedule donate stem cell patient NIH protocol allergic egg , egg product , vaccine , may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood test . Participants receive three vaccination one week apart begin least 3 week schedule stem cell donation . They observe 30 minute vaccination look immediate side effect vaccine . Approximately 3 tablespoon blood draw vaccination 1 week last vaccination evaluate vaccine safety . Blood sample also collect screen evaluation , 3 week start vaccination , 3 month last vaccination check CMV immunity . Participants keep diary , record reaction vaccine change medication . They contact telephone follow-up 3 month last vaccination report additional symptom .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Accelerated Immunization Induce Cytomegalovirus Immunity Stem Cell Donors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) infection major complication follow allogeneic stem cell transplantation ( SCT ) . The risk CMV infection SCT inversely related number CMV-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes ( CTLs ) present allograft . CMV-specific lymphocyte readily detect quantified blood sensitive vitro technique measure T cell cytokine secretion follow antigen stimulation . A previous phase I clinical trial demonstrate CMV-specific T cell safely generate normal CMV-seronegative ( naive ) subject immunization CMV vaccine , ALVAC-pp65 ( vCP260 ) , attenuate canary pox-based vaccine Sanofi Pasteur ( formerly know Aventis Pasteur , Lyon , France ) . We propose clinical trial evaluate accelerate immunization schedule vaccine . Study participants 1 ) SCT donor match recipient participate intramural NIH allogeneic SCT protocols 2 ) CMV sero-negative normal volunteer . Donors receive two three immunization prior allograft collection , follow 45 day development CMV immunity . Normal volunteer receive two three immunization follow similarly donor . CMV sero-positive subject receive two immunization ; CMV sero-negative subject receive three . Transplant ( SCT ) recipient evaluate incidence CMV infection disease . The study design two-stage phase II trial stopping rule stage . The primary outcome measure effectiveness vaccine ( ) generate cellular immunity CMV-seronegative ( naive ) donor CMV sero-negative normal volunteer ( b ) boost cellular immune response CMV-seropositive ( sensitize ) donor healthy volunteer . Secondary outcome include clinical safety profile vaccine vaccine recipient incidence CMV infection/disease transplant recipient . Since cellular immune response CMV standard model immune reconstitution post transplant , study may also provide important information feasibility immunize stem cell transplant donor microbial tumor vaccine .</detailed_description>
