	<brief_summary>This study examine phototoxicity , reaction light like exaggerated sunburn , occur people take medication voriconazole , medication use fight fungus . Sunscreens might protect skin reaction . Although phototoxicity voriconazole completely understood , may relate medication metabolize liver enzymes call cytochrome P450 enzymes-and mainly one know 2C19 . A way evaluate phototoxicity microarrays , measure much gene express cell tissue skin . Patients age 8 old schedule begin take currently take voriconazole may eligible study . Also , patient age 18 45 good health skin tone know Type 2 , usually burn tan slightly follow sun exposure , may eligible . All patient visit Dermatology Clinic . They complete two questionnaire , medical history medication , well skin response sunlight , donate 3 teaspoon blood . Patients scheduled take voriconazole visit clinic four time , , two visit 2 consecutive day begin medication two visit 2 consecutive day take least 7 day . Each visit take 1 2 hour . Patients take voriconazole blood test undergo physical exam skin test site , buttock . Researchers take photograph specific site test measure skin reaction ultraviolet ( UV ) light . UV light shin 15 small area skin , 1 x 1 centimeter . After 24 hour , redness occurs skin check . Afterward , patient begin take voriconazole accord direction researcher . At 10 day later , patient visit clinic . Sunscreen apply 1 hour later administration voriconazole , blood sample drawn check level medication . Then UV light shin 23 area skin 1 x 1 centimeter . More photographs take test sit record change skin redness . On next day , skin response evaluate . Participants control group ask avoid UV radiation wear hat clothing , use sunscreen . They give doxycycline , antibiotic , undergo procedure UV light shin small area skin , buttock . Control participants 7 study day , visit last 1 3 hour probably exceed 8 hour . They two shave biopsy Study Day 2 Study Day 7 determine skin respond UV light exposure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Pediatric/Adult Study Gene Expression Profiling Clinical Characterization Phototoxicity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Phototoxicity sunburn-like response associate certain medication phenomenon completely understood . Although clinically similar typical sunburn reaction , gene expression change phototoxic skin reaction may differ typical sunburn . - Doxycycline relatively well-tolerated know phototoxic antimicrobial use healthy volunteer increase susceptibility phototoxicity . - Characterizing potential risk factor phototoxicity secondary voriconazole , broad-spectrum antifungal agent associate potentially treatment-limiting phototoxicity , may allow identification subject risk adverse reaction via pharmacogenetic evaluation medical record review . - Subjects risk phototoxicity may benefit application effective sunscreen . Objectives : - To determine global gene expression profile skin exhibit phototoxic reaction healthy volunteer treat doxycycline , compare expression profile skin expose ultraviolet ( UV ) radiation occur absence doxycycline . - To investigate effect doxycycline alone skin phototoxic non-phototoxic healthy volunteer . - To characterize voriconazole-related phototoxicity reaction subject use phototesting determine subject may receive reasonable phototoxic protection use sunblock . Eligibility : - I &amp; II ) Healthy volunteer skin phototype II . - III ) Subjects schedule begin voriconazole therapy . - IV ) Subjects chronic voriconazole without history phototoxicity reaction . - Previously treat healthy volunteer ( I &amp; II ) evaluate either phototoxic OR non-phototoxic . Design : - I ) For Screening visit arm , forty healthy volunteer undergo screen pertinent skin exam blood work evaluate ANA/ENA liver function profile . - II ) For Study visit arm , eligible healthy volunteer undergo phototesting skin biopsy prior initiate 3-day course oral doxycycline 100 mg twice daily . - After last dose doxycycline , healthy volunteer undergo on-treatment MED testing . - In demonstrate phototoxicity , skin biopsy perform submit processing microarray analysis . - III ) Thirty-five subject schedule begin voriconazole undergo CYP450 genotyping baseline phototesting prior initiation voriconazole . - Adult subject invite undergo optional skin biopsy pre-drug on-drug . - Repeat phototesting perform subject least 7 day voriconazole determine voriconazole predisposes phototoxicity . - Subjects voriconazole phototoxicity invite undergo sunscreen test . - IV ) Seventy subject prior clinical history voriconazole phototoxicity well know voriconazole phototoxicity non-reactors undergo CYP450 genotyping potential phototesting . - To investigate effect doxycycline alone skin healthy volunteer previously categorize phototoxic non-phototoxic</detailed_description>
