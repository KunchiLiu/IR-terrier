	<brief_summary>Thiazide medication often prescribed individual high blood pressure , research show may increase individual 's risk develop diabetes . While unknown exactly thiazide cause response , likely nervous system somehow involved . This study evaluate role nervous system sugar metabolism , well determine effect thiazide medication individual high blood pressure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Link Between Thiazide Medications , Nervous System , Diabetes Individuals With High Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thiazide medication , include chlorthalidone , commonly prescribe individual high blood pressure inexpensive , effective lower blood pressure , able reduce risk heart failure stroke . Despite advantage , research show thiazide medication may increase individual 's risk develop diabetes . The exact mechanism cause remain unknown . Thiazide appear increase sympathetic nervous system activity , thereby decrease glucose reuptake metabolism skeletal muscle tissue . In turn , tend contribute glucose intolerance development diabetes . More research , however , need confirm link . Spironolactone , another blood pressure medication , pose risk develop diabetes may prove beneficial primary treatment high blood pressure . The purpose study determine role sympathetic nervous system glucose metabolism individual high blood pressure , well compare effectiveness thiazide , spironolactone , antihypertensive medication reduce blood pressure . Results study may initiate development future clinical trial involve spironolactone primary treatment reduce blood pressure . This study enroll individual high blood pressure . Participants assign one eight treatment group . Depending assigned group , participant receive chlorthalidone , spironolactone , quinapril , irbesartan , eplerenone , combination drug , without placebo . Participants attend four six study visit period 16 28 week . All participant attend baseline study visit , include physical examination , medical history review , vital sign measurement , blood urine collection . Small electrode used measure muscle nerve activity . In addition , blood pressure monitor continuously 24 hour prior start study . Depending assigned treatment group , study visit may include blood collection , blood pressure monitoring , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) record heart activity , nerve function monitoring , and/or plasma volume measurement . Participants ' baroreflex sensitivity may also measure monitor nerve end response within heart blood vessel . Insulin sensitivity measure glucose tolerance test evaluate skeletal muscle glucose uptake .</detailed_description>
