Common condition include : high blood pressure , diabetes , uncontrolled asthma COPD , abnormal heart rhythm , chronic viral infection . Neurologically healthy mean patient experience brain injury head trauma associate prolonged ( e.g. , &gt; 10 minute ) loss consciousness , seizures condition base research clinician 's judgment would either put patient increase risk and/or affect finding . ) Between 18 60 year age Patients must also medication free ( least 2 week ) participate guanfacine , except follow medication : NSAIDS ( eg , Advil ) , Tylenol , Levothyroxine ( stable dose 1 month , symptoms hypothyroidism normal thyroid lab ) , Noncentrally act antihistamine , H2 blocker ( eg , Zantac ) , PPIs ( eg , Prilosec , Prevacid ) .

In addition , AvPD group must fewer 2 schizotypal trait . Subjects may significant medical illness ( ie , insulin dependent diabetes , gastric/duodenal ulcer ) , significant neurological illness ( ie epilepsy , CMS , CVA , focal neurological lesion ) . Any cardiovascular condition , base research clinician 's judgment ( include cardiological consultation ) , would put participant increase risk consider exclusion criterion . This would certainly include evidence history exam heart block , tachyarrhythmia , angina , ventricular hypertrophy , take antihypertensive . Blood pressure parameter &gt; 25 % decrease mean arterial systolic blood pressure baseline , orthostatic decrease systolic blood pressure 20 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure 10 mm Hg , heart rate parameter 55 bpm . Participants also exclude 40 % ideal body weight . The weight limit help insure standard dos guanfacine give patient extremely overweight might receive low concentration drug central nervous system . Subjects must also correct uncorrected visual acuity 20/40 good . All participant meet DSM IV criterion current past history sustain IVsubstance dependence exclude study . Participants must free substance abuse least six month . Healthy Controls : Healthy control subject select accord criterion note method , age distribution comparable patient . Healthy control matched patient gender parental socioeconomic status . Healthy control must male female age 18 60 . Exclusion criterion : medical illness identical patient must meet criterion current lifetime DSMIV diagnosis bipolar disorder , schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , Axis II disorder . current Axis I II diagnosis family history psychotic disorder also exclude . However , avoid group HC 's highly groom unrepresentative general population exclude HC subject meeting criterion past Axis I diagnosis , adjustment disorder , dysthymic disorder , depressive disorder otherwise specify , specific phobia , sleep disorder . In addition subject meet criterion nonIV substance abuse disorder 6 month prior enrollment exclude .</criteria>
