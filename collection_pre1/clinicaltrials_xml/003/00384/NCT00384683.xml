	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn whether inability certain blood vessel cell ( endothelial cell ) function properly may help researcher predict risk complication surgery whether dysfunction contributes complication surgery . This study use blood test quantify number cell destine become endothelial cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endothelial Dysfunction As A Predictor Of Perioperative Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A small group patient ( 12 every 100 ) risk develop complication , example lung infection , surgery . Researchers always know patient risk reason patient develop complication . Your participation study may help researcher understand risk also mechanism complication . The inner layer cell blood vessel call endothelial cell . This layer cell play vital role normal function blood vessel , include blood clot inflammation . Certain condition , age , smoking , high cholesterol , chemotherapy cause cell function properly . Researchers test whether cell function properly two simple test - one blood test use ultrasound temperature probe finger look ability arm blood vessel dilate ( expand ) . The way cell function test within month schedule chemotherapy / radiation ( applicable ) , within month major chest surgery . This do patient surgery plan schedule . About 2 tablespoon blood drawn measure number circulate blood cell become endothelial cell . During scheduled surgery , researcher also collect teaspoon blood begin surgery additional endothelial risk assessment small sample lung tissue , available . Tissue remove long surgery usually throw away need diagnosis treatment purpose . The lung tissue sample collect research study take lung tissue discard . The lung tissue use determine amount naturally occur substance think play role recruit blood cell repair injured lung tissue . Blood sample ( 2 tablespoon ) also collect exercise , surgery , 24 hour surgery , 5 day surgery time discharge hospital ( ever short ) . These blood sample also collect routinely schedule post operative clinic visit 1 month , 6 month , 1 year surgery . The sample use determine amount endothelial cell blood stream . For healthy volunteer , blood sample ( 2 tablespoon ) collect baseline ( prior exercising ) , 15-30 minute past peak exercise , 3 hour past peak exercise 24 hour past past peak exercise . Data collect 30 day surgery , 1 year follow-up . These data match amount cell function measure surgery see test may use help predict patient increase risk complication . No measurement do study change surgical procedure lengthen hospital stay . This investigational study . About 90 patient take part study . All enrol The University Texas ( UT ) MD Anderson Cancer Center ( MDACC ) .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Patients schedule major thoracic surgery ( lobectomy , pneumonectomy , esophagectomy ) . 2 . Patients 18 year age old . 3 . Patients sign consent form participate study . 4 . Patients must evaluate Preanesthesia Clinic staff Anesthesiologist preoperatively . 5 . All laboratory diagnostic evaluation require used evaluate patient Preanesthesia Clinic must complete . All patient must approve surgery standard Preanesthesia Clinic . 1 . Refusal participate study . 2 . Patient age 18 . 3 . Patient unwilling sign consent . 4 . Patient unable exercise ( bedridden wheel chair bound ) . 5 . Patient enrol another study deem investigator affect oxygen metabolic efficiency presently standard care MDACC . 6 . Any patient whose condition deem unsatisfactory surgery preanesthetic evaluation . 7 . Surgery cancel reason . The patient may reenter study surgery reschedule . 8 . Patient myocardial infarction within 3 month visit Preanesthesia Clinic present new unstable angina . 9 . Patient history cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack within 3 month visit Preanesthesia Clinic . 10 . Patient history pulmonary embolic event within 3 month visit Preanesthesia Clinic . 11 . Patient know acute chronic deep vein thrombosis . 12 . Pregnant patient .</criteria>
