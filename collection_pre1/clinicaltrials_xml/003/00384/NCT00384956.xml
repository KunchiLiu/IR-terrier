	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Intravenous Azacitidine Alone Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) hematological disorder characterize ineffective hematopoiesis . The known curative treatment patient MDS allogeneic stem cell transplantation . However , minority patient candidate aggressive therapy . DNA hypomethylation agent show activity disorder postulate work reverse epigenetic mechanism gene-silencing . Recently , 5-azacitidine , administer subcutaneously seven day , receive approval FDA therapy MDS base randomize trial demonstrate diminished risk leukemic transformation improve survival compare best supportive care . The subcutaneous route administration present challenge implement therapy . In CALGB study 8921 9221 , approximately 23 % patient significant injection site pain . Moreover , 35 % patient injection site bruise extensive thrombocytopenic patient . Due limitation drug concentration administration volumes subcutaneous dosing , patient often need two three injection separate site day meet target dose . In addition , schedule administration inconvenient outpatient set secondary need schedule administration weekend . Therefore , great interest pursuing abbreviate intravenous route administration drug .</detailed_description>
