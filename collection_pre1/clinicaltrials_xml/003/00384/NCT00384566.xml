	<brief_summary>This study look effect two drug ( carvedilol metoprolol ) use patient CHF ( chronic heart failure ) . These agent beta-blockers , although effective heart failure , may cause increase airways tone thus limit air get low part lung . Carvedilol active block receptor open airway therefore theoretically may likely reduce airway tone metoprolol , although never study patient heart failure , purpose present study . We look enrol 45 patient heart failure mild obstruction flow air lung . Patients randomise either carvedilol metoprolol ( standard dos ) . Following minimum 2 week therapy study medication patient undergo study day involve assessment lung function , assessment heart failure , `` live heart failure '' questionnaire , blood test blood pressure heart rate reading . Patients crossed alternate medication . Following 2 week target dose patient undergo second study day first . The result obtain study day compare .</brief_summary>
