	<detailed_description>Introduction The duration severity tissue hypoxia relate increased mortality . Maintenance adequate oxygen delivery ( DO2 ) essential preserve organ function , sustain low DO2 path organ failure death . DO2 influence oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) reach critically low value ( DO2crit ) , VO2 start fall . Low cardiac output state ( cardiogenic , hypovolemic obstructive type shock ) , anemic hypoxic hypoxemia characterize decreased DO2 preserve oxygen extraction ratio ( OER=the ratio DO2 VO2 , VO2/ DO2 ) DO2crit remain normal . In distributive shock , oxygen extraction capability alter critical oxygen extraction ratio typically decrease . These situation typically associate increased DO2crit , VO2 become dependant DO2 even latter normal elevate . These observation help characterize four principal type circulatory shock , however classification somewhat simplistic several type alternation may coexist , particular cardiogenic shock . Rhodes et al . report outcome favorable septic patient whose VO2 increase dobutamine administration . DO2 also increase survivor . On hand DO2 increase patient whose VO2 increase . In dobutamine test propose Rhodes et al . hemodynamic response influence cardiovascular reserve degree stimulation adrenoreceptors baseline . Unfortunately global measurement DO2 VO2 may sensitive enough clinically relevant . They may fail detect regional perfusion abnormality splanchnic circulation . Measurement mixed venous oxygen saturation ( SvO2 ) pulmonary artery use calculation VO2 advocate indirect index tissue tissue oxygenation prognostic predictor critically ill patient . Catheterization pulmonary artery costly , inherent risk usefulness remains debate . Not surprisingly monitoring central venous oxygen saturation ( ScvO2 ) suggest simple chipper assessment global DO2 VO2 ratio . Near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) technique continuous , non-invasive , bedside monitoring tissue oxygen saturation ( StO2 ) . Like pulse oximetry , NIRS use principle light transmission absorption non-invasively measure concentration oxygenate hemoglobin reduce hemoglobin tissue . NIRS offer great tissue penetration discriminate compartment . Therefore provide global assessment oxygenation vascular compartment ( arterial , venous capillary ) sample volume underline tissue . We previously show thenar muscle tissue oxygen saturation stagnant ischemia decrease slow septic shock patient compare patient severe sepsis , localize infection healthy volunteer . This may due microcirculatory metabolic change , probably correlate muscle tissue oxygen consumption . The rate StO2 decrease correlate SOFA score , norepinephrine requirement , plasma lactate concentration . As recently describe , StO2 sample volume underline tissue depend vivo 3 major determinant : concentration oxy-hemoglobin , capillary recruitment vascular size ( vasodilatation constriction ) . The StO2 stagnant ischemia view light determinant . The gradual decrease ( slope ) StO2 cuff inflation-induced vascular occlusion depend mainly augmentation concentration deoxy-hemoglobin estimate tissue oxygen consumption less degree vessel de-recruitment . The StO2 upslope reperfusion ( cuff deflation ) analyze light flow paper ischemia/reperfusion test . Vasodilatation ischemia lead recruitment vessel increase local blood flow , turn result StO2 increase . It remain unclear describe change influential , however StO2 increase mirror maximal local DO2 time measurement . The development NIRS signal processing might able provide clinical important tissue hemoglobin concentration index local oxygen consumption show De Blasi et al. , index may help clarify mechanism ( ) StO2 signal varies . The aim study study skeletal muscle oxygen kinetics low flow state due combine cardiogenic septic circulatory failure , relate central heamodynamic variable outcome . We hypothesize basal StO2 could relate ScvO2 , blood flow upper limb muscle importantly contribute flow superior vena cava . The second hypothesis decrease skeletal muscle OER low muscle oxygen consumption pronounce patient septic component circulatory failure due microcirculatory metabolic change see sepsis , result high mortality . MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients Study protocol approve National Ethics Committee Slovenia , inform consent obtain patient relative . Study perform October 2004 January 2006 . After initial hemodynamic resuscitation , transthoracic ultrasound heart examination perform patient admit ICU . In patient primary heart disease , low cardiac output , sign hypovolemia , right heart catheterization pulmonary artery float catheter ( PAFC ) ( Swan-Ganz CCOmboV CCO/SvO2/CEDV , Edwars Life Sciences , USA ) perform decision treat physician . The site insertion confirm transducer waveform , length catheter insertion chest radiography . In patient systemic arterial pressure measure invasively use radial femoral arterial catheterization . Patients inserted PAFC sign low flow state ( cardiac index less 3.0 L/min/m2 ) include study . PAFC data calculate use standard formula . Localized infection , severe sepsis septic shock define accord ACCP/SCCM consensus conference definition ( 1992 ) . All patient receive standard treatment localized infection , severe sepsis septic shock include : source control , fluid infusion , catecholamine infusion , organ failure replacement and/or support therapy , intensive control blood glucose corticosteroid substitution therapy . Mechanically ventilated patient sedate midazolam and/or propofol infusion paralytic agent use . Measurements Skeletal Muscle Oxygen Kinetics Thenar muscle StO2 measure non-invasively NIRS ( 15mm Probe , InSpectra™ , Hutchinson Technology Inc. , USA ) . The value continuously monitor store computer use InSpectra ™ software . The StO2 monitor , upper arm ischemia-reperfusion test ( UIRT ) standardize follow : rapid cuff inflation elbow towards 260 mmHg stop flow induce decrease StO2 90 second , cuff deflation continuous measurement StO2 increase , overshoot stabilization . Measurements perform immediately PAFC insertion ( first 24 72 hour admission ) , second measurement perform 12-24 hour first measurement , third measurement perform ( patient still alive still PAFC insert ) 48 hour first measurement . In spontaneously breathe patient healthy volunteer measurement perform 15 minute bed rest , avoid muscular contraction . In figure 1 schematic StO2 measurement line-drawing UIRT present . The following parameter obtain : basal StO2 ( % ) : basal StO2 cuff inflation ( maximal thenar muscle StO2 find move probe thenar prominence ) ; StO2 downslope cuffing ( ∆downStO2 ) % /sec ) ; StO2 upslope ( ∆upStO2 ) % /sec ) cuff release ; overshootStO2 ( % ) : maximal StO2 cuffing release . Inspectra measure content hemoglobin sample volume underline tissue - Tissue Haemoglobin Index ( THI ) . Average muscle THI end cuff inflation report . These data automatically obtain use Inspectra Analysis Program V2.0 ( Hutchinson Technology Inc. , USA ) run MatLab 7.0 ( MathWorks Inc. , USA ) . Estimation muscle oxygen consumption ( mVO2Nirs ) muscle oxygen extraction ratio ( mOER ) calculate use follow formula : mVO2Nirs= ΔdownStO2 * THI* ( -1 ) , mOER ( % ) = ( 1- basalStO2/overshootStO2 ) * 100 . Severity disease Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment ( SOFA score ) calculate time measurement ass level organ dysfunction . Dobutamine , norepinephrine requirement represent dose drug Sto2 measurement . Used levosimendan report patient receive drug less week inclusion study . Use intra-aortic balloon pump ICU stay report . Laboratory analysis Blood withdrawn superior vena cava approximately 2cm right atrium pulmonary artery perform time StO2 measurement determine ScvO2 ( % ) SvO2 ( % ) respectively . In view know problem arise sample pulmonary artery , include possibility contaminate artery blood pulmonary capillary blood , sample site withdrawn 30 , use low-negative pressure technique , never balloon inflate . A standard volume 1mL blood obtain side withdrawn dead-space blood flush fluid . All measurement make use cooximeter ( RapidLab 1265 , Bayer HealthCare , Germany ) . Plasma lactate concentration measure use enzymatic colorimetric method ( Lactate , Roche Diagnostics , Germany ) time StO2 measurement . Data analysis StO2 curve analyze Inspectra Analysis Program V2.0 . Linear regression use extrapolate rate Δdown- Δup- StO2 UIRT . Data express median ± standard deviation ( SD ) . Non parametric test : Kolmogorov-Smirnov , Wilcoxon Fisher exact test use ( SPSS 10.0 Windows ™ , SPSS Inc. , USA ) . Spearman correlation test use determine correlation . To compare muscle tissue StO2 variables UIRT , ScvO2 SvO2 : bias , systemic disagreement measurement ( mean difference two measurement ) , precision , random error measuring ( standard deviation bias ) , calculate . The limit agreement arbitrary set Bland Altman bias± 2 SD . To determine variable independently associate survival uni- multivariate logistic regression ( Forward Stepwise ( Likelihood Ratio ) ) use . The p value &lt; 0.05 ( 2-tailed ) consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
