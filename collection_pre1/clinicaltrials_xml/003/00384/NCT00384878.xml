	<brief_summary>The primary end point study confirm objective response rate ( complete response [ CR ] partial response [ PR ] ) . A response rate 80 percent cetuximab plus cisplatin weekly 24-hour infusion high-dose 5-fluorouracil leucovorin ( P-HDFL ) chemotherapy assume . The Simon two-stage design use P1 - P0 = 0.20 . The response rate interest P0 = 60 % P1 = 80 % . The investigator reject cetuximab plus P-HDFL chemotherapy response rate 8/13 first stage , reject cetuximab plus P-HDFL chemotherapy response rate 25/35 second stage . If 8 response 13 patient first stage , study continue total 35 patient second stage . If 25 response 35 patient second stage , treatment acceptable p-value 0.05 0.20 . Evaluable patient response receive least 4 dos cetuximab ( i.e . one cycle protocol treatment ) . All enrol patient subject toxicity evaluation . The primary end point study confirm objective response rate ( RECIST , Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ) . The secondary end point study progression-free survival , overall survival , treatment-related toxicity . The analysis response treatment restrict eligible patient least one measurable lesion . The safety analysis restrict patient receive least one cycle administer chemotherapy . The time-to-event end point estimate use method Kaplan Meier base intent-to-treat principle . Overall survival define time interval date study entry date death . Progression-free survival define time interval date study entry date disease progression death , whichever occur first . Duration response define time interval date initial objective response date disease progression , responder . If event yet observe time last record , patient censor time point .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Cetuximab Plus P-HDFL First-Line Treatment Advanced Gastric Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-resectable gastric cancer incurable disease . Systemic chemotherapy confers prolongation survival improvement quality life . Regimens contain cisplatin 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) widely adopt world . A P-HDFL regimen , base primarily weekly 24-hour infusion cisplatin high-dose 5-FU leucovorin , commonly use Taiwan patient advance gastric cancer ; overall response rate around 60 % ( 45 % -76 % , 95 % C.I . ) , patient ' compliance excellent . Expression EGF EGFR detect 62.1 % 51.5 % gastric cancer tissue , respectively . Tumors simultaneous expression EGF , TGF-alpha , EGFR p185c-erbB-2 associate high BrdU label index , rapid tumor growth , unfavorable outcome . Teramoto et al . show dose-dependent growth inhibition anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody ( MoAb 528 ) EGFR-overexpressing human gastric cancer cell , vitro vivo . We recently demonstrate cetuximab cytotoxic human gastric cancer cell , cetuximab chemo-sensitizing effect cisplatin 5-FU human gastric cancer cell ( Yeh et al , unpublished observation ) . We hypothesize combination cetuximab P-HDFL improve efficacy latter advanced gastric cancer . This multi-center , prospective phase II trial . Patients histologically proven nonresectable recurrent/metastatic gastric adenocarcinoma , least one measurable lesion , prior chemotherapy radiotherapy , adequate baseline organ function eligible . Cetuximab ( Erbitux ; Merck , Germany ) 400 mg/m2 give intravenous ( IV ) infusion , initially ( i.e. , day 1 cycle 1 ) ; follow weekly IV infusion cetuximab 250 mg/m2 ( i.e. , day 8 , 15 , 22 cycle 1 , day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 cycle 2 subsequent 28-day cycle ) . Cisplatin give 24-hour continuous IV infusion dose 35 mg/m2/day , admix 5-FU 2,000 mg/m2 leucovorin ( folinic acid ) 300 mg/m2 , day 1 day 8 . A 24-hour continuous IV infusion 5-FU 2,000 mg/m2 leucovorin 300 mg/m2 give day 15 . The cycle repeat every 28 day , response evaluation perform every two cycle end protocol treatment . Confirmed objective response rate RECIST ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ) primary end-point . Using Simon two-stage design phase II study ( P1 - P0 = 0.20 response rate interest P0 = 60 % P1 = 80 % ) , total 35 patient plan enrol estimate enrollment period 12 18 month .</detailed_description>
