	<brief_title>An Adequate Cost Effective Follow Up Protocol For Bone &amp; Soft Tissue Sarcomas - A Prospective Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Follow study perform variety reason . The detection recurrence index lesion foundation surveillance . Detection medical condition secondary benefit . Psychologically , follow test serve source reassurance . Whether increase frequency follow use various expensive imaging modality screen early detection recurrence actually result improve overall survival patient extremity sarcomas question remain yet unanswered . Currently follow post -operative surveillance regime empirical vary widely centre centre . Allocation limit health funding guide evidence base recommendation rather empirical belief . An ideal surveillance regime meet criterion easy implementation , accuracy cost effectiveness . In vast country like India patient often travel thousand kilometer search quality medical care frequency routine follow visit important study role expensive screening modality draw guideline cost effective follow strategy . This study , prospective randomize controlled trial , attempt outline guideline regard role follow vi vi frequency use various image modality early detection recurrence improve overall survival patient extremity sarcoma .</detailed_description>
