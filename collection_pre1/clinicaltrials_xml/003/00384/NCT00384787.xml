	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety , immune response , tolerability adenoviral vector HIV vaccine give three-dose regimen DNA HIV vaccine . The adenoviral vaccine give arm muscle ( intramuscularly ) , skin layer ( intradermally ) , skin ( subcutaneously ) . NOTE : In October 2007 , vaccination adenoviral vaccine , VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP , discontinue . In December 2007 , vaccination DNA vaccine also discontinue . Participants follow safety immune response regular study visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Immune Response DNA HIV Vaccine Followed Adenoviral Vaccine Boost Given Three Different Ways HIV Uninfected Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One factor may affect safety immunogenicity HIV vaccine route vaccine administration . Administration skin ( intradermal ) subcutaneous tissue may immunogenic provide different pattern immune response administration intramuscular route . Previous study preventive vaccine suggest result immunogenicity follow intradermal subcutaneous vaccine administration comparable good immunogenicity observe follow intramuscular administration . Increased immunogenicity though use particular route likely result great demonstrate efficacy , require few low dos vaccine elicit sufficient immune response . The DNA HIV vaccine VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP show immunogenicity multiple clinical trial ; one trial , DNA vaccine demonstrate nearly 100 % CD4 T-cell response rate . The adenoviral vector HIV vaccine VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP show immunogenicity give intramuscularly appear safe well tolerated prior vaccine trial HIV uninfected adult . The DNA plasmid vaccine code protein HIV subtypes A , B , C. This study evaluate safety , immunogenicity , tolerability DNA HIV vaccine , follow adenoviral vaccine boost give either intramuscularly , intradermally , subcutaneously , HIV uninfected adult . All participant receive three dos DNA vaccine intramuscularly study entry Months 1 2 . Participants randomly assign one three group , differ receive adenoviral vaccine boost : - Group 1 participant receive vaccine boost intramuscularly Month 6 - Group 2 participant receive vaccine boost intradermally Month 6 - Group 3 participant receive vaccine boost subcutaneously Month 6 This study last 1 year . There 12 study visit ; physical exam , medication history , risk reduction/pregnancy prevention compliance counsel occur visit . Urine blood collection occur select visit . Participants ask complete social impact assessment Months 2 , 6 , 12 outside test belief questionnaire Months 6 12 . Participants ask record temperature side effect symptom log day vaccination 3 day thereafter report side effect . NOTE : In October 2007 , vaccination adenoviral vaccine , VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP , discontinue . In December 2007 , vaccination DNA vaccine also discontinue . Participants follow safety immune response regular study visit ask continue long term follow-up purpose safety surveillance total 5 year follow initial vaccination</detailed_description>
