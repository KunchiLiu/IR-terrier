	<brief_summary>This 8 week study compare two medication . One medication olanzapine ( 5-20 mg daily ) whereas medication orally disintegrate medication . Both medication use treat depress bipolar patient . The main focus study comparison two medication gastro-intestinal hormone weight gain .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Olanzapine undeniably one effective treatment available phase bipolar disorder . After FDA approval bipolar mania , drug become one widely prescribed treatment difficult-to-treat disorder . However , concern weight gain associate metabolic syndrome/type II diabetes impact use olanzapine . In fact , weight gain quite common olanzapine . For example , one large scale 8-week placebo-controlled trial olanzapine bipolar depression , olanzapine-treated patient gain average 2.59 kg. , placebo patient lose average 0.47 kg . Further , weight gain continue extend period time , mount average 6 kg . one year . It note , however , prior study , effort make limit weight gain . More recent data suggest intervention dietary counsel effective either prevent reverse weight gain . Olanzapine potent antagonist serotonin ( 5-HT ) 2A , 5-HT2C , histamine ( H ) 1 receptor . Significant potentially additive weight gain associate blockade 5-HT2C H1 receptor . In addition , serotonin receptor significantly involve regulation gastrointestinal ( GI ) - relate hormone secretion . Animal study suggest significant involvement 5-HT1A , 5-HT1B , 5-HT2A , 5-HT2B , 5-HT2C receptor regulation appetite , satiety , GI-related hormone . However , interplay selective activation inhibition receptor subtypes complex , difficult distinguish effect activity anxiety . Suffice say activation blockade receptor differential effect appetite , satiety , metabolic activity , well leptin , secretin , insulin , glucagon , ghrelin , neuropeptide Y , cholecystokinin . Weight gain correspond metabolic syndrome represent `` deal killer '' regard treatment patient . However , one recent small study may highly relevant discussion . De Haan et al.28 investigated relative effect standard olanzapine tablet orally-disintegrating form ( ZydisTM ) adolescents young adult gain weight olanzapine . The group randomly assign 18 patient continuation olanzapine tablet ZydisTM 16-week period . The ZydisTM-treated patient lose average 6.6 kg . continuation regular olanzapine group gain 3.7 kg . Although small , study suggest potential solution weight-gain problem associate olanzapine . Most pharmacological effect weight hormone think mediate centrally . However , De Haan et al . ( de Haan L , et al . Psychopharmacology ( Berl ) . 2004 ; 175:389-390 ) propose least difference could attributable local effect GI tract . In particular , site absorption suggest possible explanation , orally disintegrate form ( ZydisTM ) yield less exposure pylorus olanzapine standard ZyprexaTM tablet . 5-HT2 receptor may play role satiety appetite via contraction duodenum . As well , 5-HT2 5-HT3 receptor show mediate release secretin pancreatic secretion fluid bicarbonate secondary acidification duodenum ( i.e. , gastric empty ) . This effect may mediate via peripheral activation 5-HT2A receptor . In project treat 20 patient bipolar disorder olanzapine ( widely-used FDA approve treatment condition ) ; patient randomly assign ( 1:1 ) either standard Zyprexa tablet orally disintegrate Zydis . We measure symptom improvement weight gain course study . Patients give dietary counseling prior initiate either medication . In addition , contrast effect treatments GI-related hormone .</detailed_description>
