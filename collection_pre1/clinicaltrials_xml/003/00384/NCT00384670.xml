	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Trial Tetravalent Live Attenuated Dengue Vaccine Flavivirus Antibody Naïve Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study Phase I/II , open-label trial one treatment group ; 7 , healthy , flavivirus naïve child age 6 7 year reside Bangkok , Thailand . Seronegative status determine measure neutralizing ( N ) antibody titer dengue 1-4 JE virus ( JE ) use hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) ( 1st ) PRNT ( 2nd ) assay . Titers &lt; 10 &lt; 10 , respectively , consider negative . Enrolled child receive two dos tetravalent dengue vaccine study month 0 6 , two dos JE vaccine ( study benefit ) study month 7 7.5 . Enrolled child attend 20 study visit , receive 4 injection , 7 venipuncture ( one additional blood sample screen ) . In acute period ( 1 month ) follow vaccination , safety assess use symptom diary card clinical laboratory evaluation . Viremia measure 10 day post dengue vaccination . Solicited unsolicited adverse event assess 30 day follow dengue vaccination . Serious adverse event assess throughout study period . In case illness , investigator would complete additional clinical virologic evaluation . Dengue vaccine immunogenicity assess 30 day follow dengue vaccination use PRNT50 assay . The According Protocol ( ATP ) cohort determine evaluate occurrence intermittent natural dengue infection use ELISA IgM/IgG titer ratio . A long-term follow-up dengue vaccine recipient describe separate protocol ( Dengue-005 protocol ) .</detailed_description>

Chronic administration ( defined 14 day ) immunosuppressant immunemodifying drug within six month prior first vaccine dose plan administration study ( For corticosteroid , mean prednisone , equivalent , great equal 0.5 mg/kg/day . Inhaled topical steroid allow . ) Use investigational nonregistered drug vaccine protocolspecified vaccine within 30 day precede administration first dengue vaccine dose plan use study period . Planned administration vaccine foreseen study protocol within 30 day prior dengue/JE vaccine administration . Any current medical condition determine serious investigator ( e.g . seizure ) History chronic headache first order family member ( parent sibling ) history chronic headache Abnormal clinical laboratory screen test result ( base normal value set laboratory ) deem clinically significant investigator Medical Monitor ( include seropositivity HBsAg antiHCV ) Previous vaccination yellow fever virus , JEV , tickborne encephalitis virus ( TBE ) existence flavivirus antibody Any suspect confirmed immunosuppressive immunodeficient condition , include human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection Family history congenital hereditary immunodeficiency Acute illness time enrollment ( define presence moderate severe illness without fever ) . All vaccine administer person minor illness diarrhea mild upper respiratory infection without fever , i.e. , oral temperature &lt; 37.5°C . Administration immunoglobulins and/or blood product within 6 month prior study entry plan administration study period History allergic disease reaction likely exacerbate component vaccine ( include neomycin , streptomycin , gentamicin , amikacin , tobramycin , kanamycin bacitracin ; allergy dog monkey hypersensitivity proteins rodent neural origin thimerosal , allergy porcine gelatin ) Child whose parent easy access fix mobile telephone Plans move Bangkok first 8.5 month initial vaccination Parental illiteracy .</criteria>
