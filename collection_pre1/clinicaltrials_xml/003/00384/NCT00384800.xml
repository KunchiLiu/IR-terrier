	<brief_summary>Primary objective : To evaluate overall response rate tegafur/uracil ( UFUR® ) thalidomide treatment advance metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma . Secondary objective : 1 . To determine disease stabilization rate ; 2 . To assess progression-free survival overall survival ; 3 . To establish safety profile ; 4 . To evaluate change circulate factor indicate angiogenesis activity correlation objective tumor response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Tegafur/Uracil ( UFUR® ) Plus Thalidomide Treatment Advanced Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thalidomide glutamic acid derivative first develop 1950s , market sedative , tranquilizer , antiemetic morning sickness . It withdraw European Canadian market early 1960s teratogenic effect . It 1998 FDA approve thalidomide US treatment erythema nodosum leprosum , ENL . In recent year , thalidomide emerge novel treatment cancer anti-angiogenic property . The clinical efficacy demonstrate various type human cancer , myeloma , hormone-refractory prostate cancer , high-grade glioma , renal cell carcinoma , melanoma . UFUR® composite drug compose 100mg tegafur 224mg uracil ( molar ratio:1:4 ) . It market UFT® Japan market UFUR® Taiwan . Tegafur , prodrug 5-FU , easily absorb though gastro-intestinal tract slowly metabolize 5-FU mainly liver . Uracil inhibitor dihydro-pyrimidine dehydrogenase ( DPD ) , rate-limiting enzyme 5-FU degradation . Tegafur/urail expect maintain stably high concentration liver circulation . Tegafur/uracil approve indication advance gastric cancer colorectal cancer , traditionally indicated therapy 5-FU-based chemotherapy , Japan Taiwan . We hypothesize combination tegafur/uracil ( UFUR® ) thalidomide , show active HCC patient , may highly useful regimen treatment advance HCC . There several rationale underlie combination . First , anti-angiogenesis therapy may improve efficacy chemotherapy normalize abnormal vasculature tumor , thus improve delivery chemotherapeutic agent tumor cell . Second , chemotherapeutic drug give low-dose , un-interrupted , protracted way induce anti-neoplasm effect anti-angiogenesis activity . What so-called `` metronomic chemotherapy '' base direct target activation , growth , proliferation vascular endothelial cell cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent . The anti-angiogenesis effect metronomic chemotherapy suppress VEGF/VEGFR signal pathway thus potentiate agent block survival signal endothelial cell . In regard , UFUR appear good candidate metronomic chemotherapy UFUR metabolites already show inhibit angiogenesis several pre-clinical model . The combination tegafur/uracil ( UFUR® ) thalidomide clinical advantage patient HCC . Both drug orally active , thus convenient give out-patient basis . More importantly , low non-overlapping toxicity profile two drug make combination relatively safe patient HCC .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically proven HCC , HCC diagnose clinical criterion . The clinical diagnosis HCC define follow criterion meet : I.Chronic hepatitis B C virus carrier ; II.Presence hepatic tumor ( ) image finding ( sonography , CT scan , etc ) compatible HCC evidence gastrointestinal tumor ; III.A persistent elevation serum αfetoprotein ( AFP ) level ≧ 400 ng/ml . 2 . Stage IV diseases AJCC stag system , locoregional disease operable treatable transarterial ( chemo ) embolization , percutaenous interventional therapy , empirical therapy high priority . 3 . Measurable disease RECIST criterion . 4 . Karnofsky performance status ≧ 70 % . 5 . Age 18 year old . 6 . Adequate liver function reserve : I.Class A accord ChildPugh classification ; II.Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≦ 5 time ULN ; III.Serum total bilirubin ≦ 1.5 time ULN . 7 . Adequate bone marrow reserve : White blood cell ( WBC ) ≧ 4,000/mm3 absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≧ 1,500/mm3 ; Platelets ≧ 75,000/mm3 . 8 . Serum creatinine ≦ 1.5 time ULN . 9 . Previous local therapy , radiotherapy , hepatic arterial embolization , radiofrequency ablation , percutaenous inverventional therapy , allow treatment complete least 6 week prior enrollment . 10 . Sexually active patient , conjunction partner , must practice birth control 3 month thalidomide therapy . 11 . Written informed consent . 1 . Concurrent radiotherapy , chemotherapy , immunotherapeutic drug , corticosteroid investigational drug ( ) . 2 . Previous exposure following : I.Cytotoxic chemotherapy ; II.Thalidomide . 3 . CNS metastasis . 4 . Concomitant disease might aggravate investigational drug : I.Active noncontrolled infection ; II.≧ NCI grade 2 peripheral neuropathy ; III.History seizure within past 10 year currently anticonvulsant medication . 5 . Organ transplantation . 6 . Major systemic disease inappropriate systemic chemotherapy . 7 . Mental status fit clinical trial . 8 . Inability take medication orally . 9 . Pregnant breastfeed woman . 10 . Life expectancy le 3 month . 11 . Other malignancy exception curatively treat nonmelanoma skin cancer cervical carcinoma situ , patient diseasefree 5 year .</criteria>
