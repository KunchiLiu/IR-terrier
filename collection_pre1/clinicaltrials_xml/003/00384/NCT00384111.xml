	<brief_summary>This study treat follicular lymphoma patient receive previous treatment R-CVP . Half patient receive Zevalin R-CVP half receive R-CVP . The two patient group compare determine Zevalin give R-CVP therapy provide great benefit receive additional anti-cancer therapy R-CVP .</brief_summary>
