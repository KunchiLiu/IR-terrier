	<detailed_description>This study ass efficacy Botulinum Toxin A ( BOTOX® ) inject lumbar paravertebral muscle reduce pain disability subject suffer sub-acute low back pain ( duration 6 16 week ) arise identifiable muscle strain injury back trauma . The treatment modality technique use base upon three successful prior open-labeled pilot study do research group investigate effect BOTOX® relief chronic low back pain . This study , however , employ prospective , double-blind , randomize , placebo control trial control placebo mechanical trigger-point injection effect . Subjects also assess 6 month define duration efficacy BOTOX® . Sixty subject randomly assign one two arm . There two part study . In first group receive either BOTOX® placebo injection lumbar paravertebral muscle . The subject assess use validated scale pain disability prior injection weekly monthly thereafter three month . Subjects improve single follow-up visit 6 month subject improve enter second , open-label part receive BOTOX® injection monitor weekly monthly next 3 month , give total subject participation period 6 month .
