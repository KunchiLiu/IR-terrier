	<brief_summary>Recently , grow body evidence support find anemia frequently occur patient chronic heart failure ( CHF ) . Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , well , highly prevalent among heart failure patient , anemia CKD independently associate increased mortality . A vicious circle establish CHF cause chronic renal insufficiency anemia , CKD aggravate anemia , turn , worsen CHF . Treatment anemia break circle improve quality life , cardiac renal function patient severe CHF . Intravenous iron alone prove allow maintenance target hematocrit one-third chronic renal failure predialysis patient . Based consideration , intravenous iron anemia patient CHF moderate CKD would represent reasonable therapeutic approach . The aim trial ass efficiency intravenous iron therapy management mild moderate anemia associate CHF NYHA III class concomitant moderate CKD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravenous Iron Patients With Severe Chronic Heart Failure Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intravenous iron administration CHF patient absolute functional iron deficiency could correct anemia , thus improve cardiac function judge ejection fraction NYHA functional class . If true , enhancement cardiac output increase oxygen delivery tissue , include renal cortex . This might improve renal function slow rate progression CKD reflect slope decline glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) . Since erythropoietin synthesis locate peritubular fibroblast outer renal cortex , affect area chronic hypoxia , increase renal blood flow anemia correction expect restore optimal erythropoietin production normalize plasma Epo level . The primary objective ass efficiency intravenous iron therapy management mild moderate anemia associate chronic heart failure NYHA III class concomitant moderate chronic kidney disease . The secondary objective determine correction anemia patient affect cardiac function , rate progression CKD plasma erythropoietin level . The study conduct accordance Declaration Helsinki Tokyo , amendment Venice ( 1983 ) , approval local ethic committee . The total observation period 28 week , pre-study phase ( selection , randomization subject ) 4 weeks.The study period last 24 week , possible extension 48 week , depend result first phase . 200 anemic patient chronic heart failure class NYHA III concomitant stage 3 chronic kidney disease enrol , obtain write informed consent . All patient evaluate inclusion exclusion criterion enrollment visit pre-study phase . Only patient fulfil request criterion evaluation moment enrol . The enrolled subject centrally randomly assign 1:1 ratio two study group . Group I ( treatment group ) : Subjects assign group receive intravenous iron ( ferric sucrose product Venofer® 2 % , 5mL/ampoule ) start dose 200mg ( 2 ampoule ) dilute 150mL 0.9 % NaCl solution , 60 minute , week first four administration , every week hemoglobin level reach 12g/dL . Then , iron dose adjust 1 ampoule 2-4 week interval , need maintain level serum ferritin ≤500ng/mL . Iron administration discontinue serum ferritin exceed 500ng/mL , restart reduce dosage ( 1 ampoule every 2-4 week ) serum ferritin decrease value . Conventional treatment CHF continue need . Group II ( control group ) : Subjects assign group continue conventional treatment CHF need , without iron supplementation . No anti-anemic medication administer either group study period . Subject 's visit take place two week interval first 12 week study phase 4 week apart thereafter . At visit record , accord schedule , data concern physical examination , include sign CHF , hematological iron status , renal function , concomitant medication adverse event . Parameters record time first iron administration serve baseline determination . The completion study declare 200 subject complete whole observation period , accord protocol .</detailed_description>
