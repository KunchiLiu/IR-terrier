	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare standard surgical procedure , open surgical microdiscectomy , use primarily relieve leg pain repair disc herniation newer surgical procedure , hydrodiscectomy Spinejet速 . The study examine well procedure reduces subject pain disability one-year period . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI-use magnetic field produce image ) low spinal column take surgery also look determine physical change take place course year . Subjects enrol study also ask keep track medical expense relate treat back pain see surgery compare reduce pocket expense .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial Comparing SpineJet速 Hydrodiscectomy Open Lumbar Microdiscectomy Treatment Lumbar Radiculopathy Due Disc Herniation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize multi-clinic study support HydroCision , Inc. compare open lumbar microdiscectomy percutaneous lumbar discectomy Spinejet速 patient contain small extrude disc herniation nerve root contact concordant radiculopathy . Initially pilot study enroll 20 patient 6 month statistical analysis perform evaluate merit continue study . Patients randomize 1:1 ratio . If study participant randomize receive open lumbar microdiscectomy referral neurosurgeon make patient . All patient participate study must screen , meet study inclusion/exclusion criterion sign inform consent HIPAA form prior research participation . Once randomization receive either hydrodiscectomy Spinejet速 open lumbar microdiscectomy occur study participant evaluate within two week schedule procedure . If patient randomize either group refuse propose treatment plan , remove study participant . At pre-op visit patient demographic , history , healthcare coverage , duration symptom , concomitant medication , level HNP , MRI , Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) , Beck 's Inventory Depression ( BID ) scale Oswestry Disability Index ( ODI ) score well Lumbar Spine Outcomes questionnaire ( LSOQ ) collect . At time surgery patient discography surgical level 2cc Isovue contrast inject 0.04cc/sec . Evidence epidural extravasation would exclude patient study participation . At completion procedure device run time length procedure record . Post-operative patient return clinic 5 follow-up visit , evaluate 1 week , 1 month , 3 month , 6 month 12 month interval . Blinded observer record sensory deficit touch , pain , temperature , motor strength major muscle group , patient reflex ( 0-4 scale ) , SLR ( degrees prone position ) analgesic dose frequency . Patients also complete VAS , BID , LSOQ , ODI score calculate follow-up visit . MRIs perform 1month follow-up visit patient hydrodiscectomy study participant MRI 12 month visit . MRIs read radiologist blind study procedure determine type , size protrusion nerve root contact . Patients ask adverse event , change medication , health concern follow-visit . Over course study patient also ask keep study-specific log expense incur due back pain . Physicians patient participate study pay $ 50.00 per study visit maximum $ 300.00 . Imaging study hydrodiscectomy procedure provide patient charge copay/deductibles pay third party payer .</detailed_description>
