	<brief_title>Evaluating Relationship Between Inflammation , Genetics , Stress Development High Blood Pressure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High blood pressure complex condition cause many factor , include obesity , diet , genetics , stress . Maintaining healthy balance sodium body important adequate blood pressure control . Some individual experience sustain high blood pressure period extend stress , combine inability excrete enough sodium urine re-establish normal blood pressure level . This type stress-induced high blood pressure relate interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , protein stimulate inflammation immune response . To determine interaction stress , inflammation , genetics , study examine role IL-6 regulate sodium level blood pressure individual undergoing stress . This information useful determine new way evaluate risk factor high blood pressure . This study examine previously collect DNA sample young adult participate prior genetic study . There study visit participant . IL-6 , IL-6R , glycoprotein 130 ( gp130 ) , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) gene analyze sample ; change plasma level IL-6 CRP response stress examine select sample . The parent participant ask provide cheek swab additional DNA analysis .</detailed_description>
