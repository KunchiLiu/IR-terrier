	<brief_title>Usefulness Microbiological Tests Community-Acquired Pneumonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In community-acquired pneumonia , identification etiologic agent theoretically important advantage . For individual patient , facilitate administration target , narrow-spectrum antibiotic therapy may improve efficacy treatment , reduce risk antibiotic-related toxicity . For community , microbiologic result contribute understanding local microbial epidemiology community-acquired pneumonia antimicrobial resistance pattern pathogens , information essential instauration modification empiric treatment regimen . Guidelines recommend admitted patient community-acquired pneumonia collection two set blood culture , good quality sputum sample Gram stain culture , sample pleural fuid present , severe patient , urine sample antigen detection . In contrast , several prospective study ( usually without include urinary test ) conclude microbiological study limit value management patient admit community-acquired pneumonia . In addition , microbiological study could provide erroneous incomplete information . Thus , investigation show false-positive result pneumococcal antigen detection urine cause frequent persistence positivity infection nasopharyngeal bronchial colonization . Other author suggest community-acquired pneumonia polymicrobial infection ; consequently , despite detection true microorganism , treatment need also address potential pathogenic agent . The purpose study assess clinical economic derive initial microbiological study , include antigen detection test urine Streptococcus pneumoniae Legionella pneumophila , patient community-acquired pneumonia . The hypothesis community-acquired pneumonia usually monomicrobial infection . Therefore , early detection etiology allow select active , narrow-spectrum , cheap , less toxic antibiotic agent .</detailed_description>
