	<detailed_description>Weight gain serious , common side effect many antipsychotic medication . It frequent cause poor adherence antipsychotic medication major contributor medical problem include Syndrome X , various cancer , osteoarthritis sleep apnea . Syndrome X , also call Metabolic Syndrome , constellation abnormality metabolism confer high risk coronary heart disease . Syndrome X include glucose intolerance , dyslipidemia , hypertension , central obesity . Long-term patient antipsychotic medication markedly increase rate Syndrome X consistent increase cardiovascular morbidity decrease life expectancy . A recent meta-analysis estimate weight gain 10 week treatment variety antipsychotic find clozapine high average weight gain ( 4.45 kg ) , follow olanzapine ( 4.15 kg ) , quetiapine ( 2.2 kg ) , risperidone ( 2.18 kg ) , ziprasidone ( 0.04 kg ) . For drug weight gain continue many month , time plateau directly relate initial degree weight gain . Early data recently approve antipsychotic , aripiprazole , show weight neutral characteristic effect weight still determine . A recent publication 224 subject switch three different switch strategy haloperidol , thioridazine , risperidone olanzapine aripiprazole find weight loss 1.3 1.7 kg 8 week aripiprazole . Cholesterol level improve subject switch olanzapine aripiprazole . Atypical antipsychotic medication improve factor associate Syndrome X could offer attractive alternative patient already developed constellation symptom treatment antipsychotic . It known switch aripiprazole atypical antipsychotic medication cause excessive weight gain and/or abnormality glucose , lipid blood pressure result significant improvement factor simply halt worsen . If worsen halt , switch weight-inducing drug aripiprazole do early . If factor associate Syndrome X reverse , switch aripiprazole would beneficial even abnormality develop . We propose open-label pilot study change weight , BMI , body composition , lipid , glucose , insulin metabolic parameter occur subject switch treatment olanzapine , risperidone quetiapine aripiprazole . We also determine rest energy expenditure ( REE ) respiratory quotient ( RQ ) measure metabolic cart determine either energy expenditure propensity store energy fat may involve change weight detect . Food intake , hunger , physical activity also assess . Recruited subject enter screen phase patient eligibility determine assessment psychiatric physical health , include physical examination , blood test urine drug screen . Subjects meet eligibility criterion discontinue . Thirty subject enrol open label study . At entry study , anthropometric measure ( wt , ht , waist , hip ) , body composition , respiratory quotient ( RQ ) , rest energy expenditure ( REE ) , measure food intake , hunger , physical activity assess . Additionally , Positive Negative Symptom Scale ( PANSS ) use assess clinical status woman blood pregnancy test require prior DXA scan . Following completion assessment , subject begin two week cross-taper current antipsychotic aripiprazole . Psychiatric symptom , weight , medical status medication query reassess 2 , 4 , 8 12 week . RQ hunger reassess 4 week time point . Fasting bloodwork , pregnancy test , urine drug screen , vital sign , baseline assessment repeat 12 week time point early termination . During study , dosage aripiprazole tailor subject 's need base symptom side effect , remain maximum recommended dosage .</detailed_description>
