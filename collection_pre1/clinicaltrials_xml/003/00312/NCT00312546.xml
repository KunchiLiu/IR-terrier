	<detailed_description>VPA type medication normally use treat seizure nervous system problem . It find VPA work HIV release virus rest CD4 cell , allow anti-HIV medication attack . The purpose study assess efficacy VPA use HIV infect participant use highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) . The expected duration participation individually enrol participant depend study group participant place may range approximately 24 144 week . An initial screening visit occur 30 120 day prior study entry . A physical exam , medical medication history assessment , blood urine collection occur screen . Leukapheresis genital secretion collection occur 30 120 day prior study entry , separate initial screening . In Step 1 , participant receive VPA continue current HAART . Doses VPA vary participant . Study visit occur Days 0 3 Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 24 . A physical exam blood urine collection occur visit . Leukapheresis genital secretion collection occur study entry Weeks 12 16 . After 24 week , participant enter Step 2 . Those participant respond VPA Step 1 enroll Step 2A . Participants respond VPA Step 1 enroll Step 2B . In Step 2A , participant discontinue VPA receive intensify therapy ( enfuvirtide ) administer 24 week twice daily . Study visit occur Weeks 25 , 28 , 32 , 36 , 40 , 48 . A physical exam blood urine collection occur visit . Leukapheresis occur Weeks 36 40 . Participants respond intensified therapy Step 2A enroll Step 3A . Participants respond intensified therapy Step 2A enroll Step 3B . In Step 2B , participant continue receive VPA 96 week . Study visit occur every 8 week Week 120 . A physical exam blood urine collection occur visit . Leukapheresis occur Week 72 Week 120 . In Step 3A , VPA add enfuvirtide 16 week . The study discontinue participant respond . Study visit occur screen , entry , Day 0 , Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 22 . A physical exam blood urine collection occur visit . Leukapheresis occur screen , entry , Day 0 Weeks 12 16 . In Step 3B , participant may continue receive enfuvirtide 96 week . Study visit occur every 8 week Week 144 . A physical exam blood urine collection occur visit . Leukapheresis occur Week 96 144 . Participants may choose enter observational period time start Step 2 Step 3 . During observational period , participant continue take HAART VPA enfuvirtide . Upon enter observational period , study staff contact participant every 8 week review medical record . Each participant study visit within 8 week begin new step . These interim study screening include physical exam , medical history , blood urine collection . Participants may ask additional leukapheresis perform discontinue study medication 12 week . Each leukapheresis procedure take place University North Carolina Apheresis Clinic Chapel Hill , North Carolina . This study provide participant ' current HAART regimen medication . NOTE : As 05/20/08 , observational period Steps 1 , 2 , 2A , 2B , 3B discontinue .</detailed_description>
