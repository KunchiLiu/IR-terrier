	<criteria>Subjects must satisfy follow criterion enrol study : Man woman age 18 year old Diagnosis follicular BNHL follow subtypes ( World Health Organization [ WHO ] classification 1997 ) : follicular lymphoma ( FL ) ( Grades 1 2 ) . Documented relapse progression follow prior antineoplastic treatment . New lesion objective evidence progression exist lesion must document relapse progression follow previous therapy . If prior regimen include rituximab , subject must respond ( complete response [ CR ] , unconfirmed complete response [ CRu ] , partial response [ PR ] ) , time progression ( TTP ) first dose rituximab must 6 month . At least 1 measurable tumor mass ( great 1.5 cm long dimension great 1.0 cm short axis ) previously irradiate , grow since previous irradiation In opinion investigator decision initiate treatment justified manage subject 's lymphoma No active central nervous system lymphoma Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ ECOG ] status ≤ 2 Female subject must postmenopausal ( least 6 month ) , surgically sterile , abstinent , , sexually active , practice effective method birth control ( e.g. , prescription oral contraceptive , contraceptive injection , intrauterine device , doublebarrier method , contraceptive patch , male partner sterilization ) entry throughout study ; negative serum betahuman chorionic gonadotropin ( βhCG ) pregnancy test screening .
