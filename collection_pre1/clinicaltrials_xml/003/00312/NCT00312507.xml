	<brief_summary>The objective pilot study examine feasibility safety perform large trial ass outcomes follow treatment meconium aspiration syndrome surfactant lavage compare bolus surfactant . Specifically , determine surfactant lavage result rapid improvement physiologic outcome ( e.g . pulmonary compliance ) , well clinical outcome ( e.g . length time mechanical ventilation ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Meconium-stained amniotic fluid occur 5 20 % birth United States , meconium aspiration syndrome occur approximately 5 % infant . In disease process , meconium believe mechanically obstruct airway , cause chemical pneumonitis inactivate surfactant . Approximately one-third baby need mechanical ventilation approximately 5 % die . Since 1990 surfactant standard care treatment respiratory distress syndrome . Pulmonary compliance gas exchange often improve rapidly administration surfactant . Its use lead significantly reduce mortality rate improve short-term respiratory function . There evidence support use neonatal respiratory disorder dysfunction inactivation surfactant . Its use meconium aspiration syndrome well-studied alternate use date . The Canadian Pediatric Society 's ( 2005 ) position statement recommend infant meconium aspiration syndrome intubate require 50 % oxygen receive exogenous surfactant therapy . Studies animal human suggest surfactant help meconium aspiration , either administer bolus lavage . There trial date compare efficacy surfactant lavage bolus surfactant human neonate meconium aspiration examine physiologic effect surfactant , give either bolus lavage , treatment meconium aspiration syndrome . This study assess relative efficacy two method administer surfactant effect physiologic clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
