	<brief_title>Effectiveness Targeted Cognitive Training Neurological Deficits People With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia chronic brain disorder cause severe disability . It characterize psychotic symptom , include hallucination delusion . Neurocognitive deficit , impair neurocognitive processing efficiency , also affect people schizophrenia . This deficiency speed accuracy brain perceives respond target cause scrambled message transmit brain , thereby affect executive control memory . Medications available effectively treat psychotic symptom . The neurocognitive deficit , however , subside medication treatment , responsible failure improve e psychosocial functioning people schizophrenia , even psychotic symptom go remission . The targeted cognitive training ( TCT ) exercise study specifically design improve speed accuracy perception response verbal visuo-spatial target . This study determine effectiveness reward-intensive , computer-based TCT improve neurocognitive deficit people schizophrenia . Participants double-blind study pair accord IQ baseline symptom severity . One member pair randomly assign training exercise use TCT . The assigned control intervention , involve commercially available computer game . All participant complete exercise assign intervention 1 hour per day , 5 day per week , 90 hour train accumulate . Neuroimaging perform subgroup participant examine change brain activation pattern response cognitive training . Upon study completion 6-month follow visit , participant assess improvement follow area : cognitive performance ; symptom profile ; quality life ; social cue recognition .</detailed_description>
