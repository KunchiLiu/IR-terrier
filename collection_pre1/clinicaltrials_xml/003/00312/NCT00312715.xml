	<brief_summary>This study use technique call microperfusion examine thyroid hormone involve fat metabolism . The thyroid gland produce two kind hormone : T3 T4 . Some T4 change T3 various organ leave thyroid . The T3 stimulate body burn fat . People different rate change T4 T3 , may lead difference body fat among different people . Microperfusion base exchange substance across tiny hole small plastic tube call `` probe , '' insert numb skin fat pad . Through opening , fat pad continuously rinse small amount fluid , exchange substance occurs . The fluid drip open probe collect vial . Small amount study drug infuse amount substance release fat pad response measure . Healthy normal volunteer 18 year age old may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination blood test . Participants undergo microperfusion . A needle place arm vein collect blood sample end experiment measure thyroid hormone substance blood . The skin fat pad next umbilicus ( navel ) numb two microperfusion probe insert . A salt water solution infuse fat pad one hour substance fluid measure fluid leave fat pad . After 1 hour isoproterenol , drug aid energy production fat , add help determine level fat metabolism . After additional hour small amount thyroid hormone add fluid sample collect leave body . Two catheter inserted experiment . Small volume sterile fluid circulate continuously tube sample collect regular interval .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study examine two thyroid preparation , levothyroxine ( T4 ) liothyronine ( T3 ) , affect subcutaneous adipose tissue normal subject . Thyroid hormone play important role maintenance energy metabolism . Specifically , hyperthyroidism associate weight loss via increase metabolic rate lipolysis . While phenomenon study vitro quite extensively , little information available local action thyroid hormone adipose tissue vivo , particular , present information available role peripheral conversion thyroid hormone subcutaneous adipose tissue . We thus propose study local action thyroid hormone adipose tissue use microdialysis , minimally invasive technique allow serial determination component extracellular fluid . The measurement glycerol correction change blood flow use evaluate effect thyroid hormone local lipolysis . Healthy volunteer 18 year age old may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood test . Subjects hyperlipidemia , impair glucose tolerance diabetes thyroid disease eligible participation study . Qualifying study participant undergo subcutaneous fat tissue microdialysis ass effect T3 T4 activity fat tissue . The medication isoproterenol T3 T4 inject fat tissue skin abdomen , fluid sample collect area 6-12 hour period use small needle . Glycerol measure study thyroid hormone affect fat metabolism . During procedure 10 % glucose solution infuse catheter arm limit lipolysis due fasting . Four different set experiment perform different thyroid hormone dose and/or duration . These experiment provide new information role thyroid hormone regulation adipose tissue metabolism help identify new treatment management obesity .</detailed_description>
