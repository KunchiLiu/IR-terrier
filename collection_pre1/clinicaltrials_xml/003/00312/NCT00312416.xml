	<brief_summary>Brimonidine tartrate alpha-2 agonist ocular hypotensive drug exerts effect cause decrease aqueous production increase uveoscleral outflow . It proven reduce increase intraocular pressure glaucoma ocular hypertension . As alpha 2 agonist Brimonidine belongs class drug Clonidine ; however , molecular structure sufficiently different make selective alpha 2 receptor Clonidine . Unlike Clonidine , Brimonidine appear effect central nervous system therefore cause sedation systemic hypotension . In addition know effect lower intraocular pressure , alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonist neuroprotective . It , however , show Brimonidine potent vasoconstrictor ciliary body thus reduce aqueous humor production . Little , however , know potential vasoconstrictor effect Brimonidine posterior pole eye . This clinical importance , optic nerve head ischemia appear contribute glaucoma pathophysiology . This study perform investigate effect topical Clonidine vs. topical Brimonidine choroidal blood flow intraocular pressure isometric exercise .</brief_summary>
