	<brief_title>MOVIPREP® Versus PICOLAX® Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gut cleansing perform use split dose MOVIPREP® , 1-litre solution ( 1x sachet A 1x sachet B ) even prior day colonoscopy 1-litre solution ( 1x sachet A 1x sachet B ) morning colonoscopy , PICOLAX® , 150 mL solution ( 1 sachet ) 8am day prior day colonoscopy , 150 mL solution ( 1 sachet ) 6 8 hour later . The primary efficacy measure degree gut cleansing , assess physician performing colonoscopy . A 5-grade scale use assess predefined colon area , result final grading ( A D ) overall quality bowel preparation treatment . Grades A B consider success , Grades C D failure . The secondary efficacy measure : - necessary patient return colonoscopy due insufficient clearance/cleansing colon prior normal schedule repeat procedure ? - taste acceptability - ease taking , ability complete bowel preparation treatment - recommend diet compliance - would patient prepared repeat bowel preparation treatment necessary ? - well-being effect usual activity whilst take bowel preparation treatment - overall impression bowel preparation treatment prior colonoscopy - symptom experience since take first study bowel preparation treatment prior colonoscopy Safety tolerability assess collection adverse event , clinical laboratory test , physical examination , weight vital sign ( blood pressure pulse rate ) data . Number patient : It intend recruit approximately 70 patient order achieve least 60 evaluable patient use randomisation ratio 1:1 MOVIPREP® : PICOLAX® .</detailed_description>
