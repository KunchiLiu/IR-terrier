A fixed-dose combination tablet 3TC , NVP , d4T recommend first-line treatment HIV infect adult Thailand . There similar product develop child several reason : pediatric dose base age , weight , body surface area ; developmental change may influence bioavailability pharmacokinetics ( PK ) ARVs ; medication adherence may also problem . The purpose study gather bioavailability PK data child take fixed-dose tablet 3TC , NVP , d4T . This information compare bioavailability PK individual liquid formulation ARVs . This study two stage . Stage 1 last minimum 4 week ; Stage 2 last minimum 8 week . In Stage 1 , patient randomly assign one two arm .

To encourage medication adherence , study staff make home visit phone call patient 's parent guardian first week treatment regimen . Medical history , physical exam , urine collection occur Days 11 25 . Also Days 11 25 , patient admit hospital ensure 100 % medication adherence provide blood PK study . Stage 1 patient eligible Stage 2 . In Stage 2 , patient stratify body weight , randomly assign one two arm . Arm A receive fixed-dose tablet twice daily 4 week , switch individual liquid formulation twice daily 4 week . Arm B receive individual liquid formulation twice daily 4 week , switch fixed-dose tablet twice daily 4 week .
