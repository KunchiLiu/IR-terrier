	<brief_title>Using Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy With MRI Non-invasively Determine Breast Cancer Extent Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer second lead cause death woman . The spread cancer breast lymph node significant factor determine breast cancer survival . Currently , surgical procedure perform determine lymph node involvement . Full axillary lymph node dissection high morbidity associate procedure . While sentinel lymphadenectomy avoids full axillary dissection clinically negative axilla untreated patient , report false negative rate le 10 % . Others report high false negative rate neoadjuvant chemotherapy . For reason , considerable interest non-invasive method may allow stag axilla . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) breast contrast-enhancement increasingly use breast cancer patient determine size tumor extent . A report Europe publish regard use evaluate axillary lymph node metastases preoperatively , result appear promise . Kvistad et al . demonstrate lymph node metastasis use dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI , study sensitivity 83 % , specificity 90 % , accuracy 88 % . Luciani et al , suggest lymph node large size , irregular contour , round hilum , high-signal intensity T2 sequence , mark enhancement associate malignancy . Magnetic resonance image spectroscopy ( MRS ) use clinical practice evaluation brain tumor method noninvasive detection tumor metabolism . More recently , use soft-tissue tumor , include breast . Like soft-tissue tumor , breast cancer increase level amino acid choline . In several study , sensitivity specificity MRS detect breast cancer range 73 % -92 % 71 % -93 % , respectively . No known MRS data publish regard axillary lymph node involvement patient breast cancer . It postulate choline peak elevate lymph node metastatic breast cancer . This observational study . All eligible patient give informed consent complete MRI/MRS screening questionnaire contraindication undergo MRI/MRS image prior clinically indicated sentinel lymphadenectomy may follow axillary dissection determine surgeon course surgery .</detailed_description>
