	<brief_summary>People Fabry disease alteration genetic material ( DNA ) cause deficiency a-galactosidase A enzyme . Fabrazyme drug help breakdown remove certain type fatty substance call `` glycolipids . '' These glycolipids normally present within body cell . In Fabry disease , glycolipids build various tissue liver , kidney , skin , blood vessel a-galactosidase A present , present small quantity . The build glycolipid ( globotriaosylceramide GL-3 ) level tissue particular thought cause clinical symptom common Fabry disease . This study design verify loss Fabrazyme occur simultaneous Fabrazyme infusion hemodialysis patient currently receive Fabrazyme dose 1.0 mg/kg every 2 week .</brief_summary>
