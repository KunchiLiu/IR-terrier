	<brief_summary>This study compare two different exercise program , Qi Gong ( gentle stretching , breathe ) aerobics program ( box dance ) see child chronic pain fibromyalgia able take part program . We would also like know easy take part exercise program . We hypothesize child chronic musculoskeletal pain FM , engage Qigong fitness training , compliant , equivalent possibly superior improvement measure motor function ( peak power , endurance , metabolic efficiency ) compare child give aerobic fitness exercise program .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Qigong vs. Aerobic Exercise Treatment Childhood Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Childhood fibromyalgia ( FM ) chronic musculoskeletal pain common sometimes devastate pediatric disorder result widespread pain , fatigue , tenderness significant disability . Exercises , include vigorous aerobics , complementary alternative health strategy - like Qigong - show safe effective treatment adult FM chronic pain . Qigong may tolerable vigorous exercise . No data available treatment child . Research Question : To test feasibility study Qigong exercise versus aerobic fitness exercise reduce symptom disability child FM chronic pain . Methods : Randomized single-blind pilot study 30 childhood FM/chronic pain patient allocate either 12 week supervise Qigong therapy 12 week supervise graded aerobic exercise training ( cardio-karate ) . Expected Results : Physical exercise training - whether Qigong aerobic exercise - represent potentially feasible , safe effective alternative therapy may increase ability child resume normal activity daily life . Exercise training may therefore emerge pivotal mode therapy child FM/chronic pain . Results study allow u plan definitive study . Specific Objectives : 1 . To study feasibility enrol , randomize study participant FM/chronic pain use validated measure symptom , physical psychosocial function , quality life exercise test . 2 . Acquire pilot data allow estimation effect size comparison 2 form exercise - standard aerobic fitness exercise , specially design Qigong program . This effect size estimate use design subsequent definitive randomize controlled trial .</detailed_description>
