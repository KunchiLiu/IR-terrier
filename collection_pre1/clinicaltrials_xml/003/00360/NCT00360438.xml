	<detailed_description>Rasburicase design help decrease prevent high level uric acid may occur start chemotherapy . A high level uric acid may lead reduce kidney function kidney failure . TLS occur high uric acid level cause breakdown tumor cell start chemotherapy . The dead tumor cell release uric acid symptom kidney failure , excessive amount potassium phosphorus , blood . Before start treatment study , `` screening test . '' These test help doctor decide eligible take part study . Your complete medical history record , physical exam , include measurement vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , breathe rate ) , height , weight . You blood draw ( 2 tablespoon ) routine test . Women able child must negative blood ( sample use routine blood draw ) urine pregnancy test . If find eligible take part study , receive rasburicase needle vein 30 minute day 5 day row . You receive chemotherapy within 4-24 hour first dose rasburicase . On Days 1-5 ( study drug treatment period ) , physical exam , include measurement vital sign . During time , blood drawn ( 2 tablespoon ) day routine test . You blood draw ( less 1 teaspoon ) PK test different time point throughout study . PK test measure level study drug blood different time . You total 14 sample draw . Your blood drawn Day 1 dose rasburicase 30 minute 4 , 8 , 24 , 48 , 72 , 96 , 96.5,100,104,120 ( Day 6 ) ,168 ( Day 8 ) , 336 ( Day 15 ) hour dose study drug . You blood draw ( less 1 teaspoon ) measure level uric acid blood different time point throughout study researcher learn effectiveness study drug disease . You total 7 sample draw . Your blood drawn Day 1 dose rasburicase 4 , 24 , 48 , 72 , 96,120 ( Day 6 ) , 144 ( Day 7 ) hour dose study drug . You also blood drawn ( le 1 teaspoon ) antibody test different time point throughout study . Antibody test method check protein ( IgG ) make body show body react rasburicase . You least 5 sample draw . Your blood drawn Day 1 dose rasburicase Day 14 , Day 35 , 3 6 month dose study drug . If positive IgG ( antibody protein ) 6-month blood draw antibody test , continue blood drawn ( le 1 teaspoon ) every 6 month antibody protein negative . If experience side effect relate allergic reaction treatment study drug ( 30 day last dose study drug ) , additional blood draw ( le 1 teaspoon ) antibody test within 48 hour reaction . You take study disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . You assessments end study drug treatment ( Days 1 5 ) . These assessment include physical exam , include measurement vital sign , Days 14 35 . You also blood drawn ( 2 tablespoon ) routine test Days 8 14 . This investigational study . Rasburicase authorize FDA use ( adult ) research . Rasburicase provide free charge study . Up 20 patient take part multicenter study . Up 20 enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
