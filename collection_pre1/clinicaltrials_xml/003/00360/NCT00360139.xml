	<brief_summary>Lipoatrophy condition affect certain individual , commonly infect HIV virus . Lipoatrophy however also affect individual suffer recurrent systemic infection , weaken immune system , certain patient suffer cancer receive chemotherapeutics . In contrast , lipoatrophy sometimes present individual perfectly healthy genetically predispose factor contribute facial emaciation lipoatrophy . The function injectable filler treatment dermal contour deformity smooth dermal depression form loss volume . These often elastic contour filler ( also know soft tissue augmentation device ) correct hollowness around eye , add fullness thin lip , balance disproportionate face correct topographical anomaly . This study aim : - Objectively measure improvement contour-deformities Sculptra™ injection baseline study closure utilize Primos™ photographic/topographical measuring system . - Evaluate efficacy , longevity duration volume-correction subject HIV positive HIV negative . - Assess safety Scupltra™ dermal filler use correct volume deformity cause lipoatrophy subject HIV negative .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Determine Efficacy Sculptra™ Dermal Filler Correction Contour Deformities Caused Lipoatrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Soft tissue filler use temporarily fill facial line wrinkle augment contour deformity . There variety soft tissue filler available . Sculptra™ use correct dermal atrophy HIV non-HIV population . Almost clinical trial use visual assessment scale grade correction well persistence . Recently , dermal ultrasound use provide objective measurement dermal thickening , ultrasound procedure measure fraction dermis subject high degree variability difficulty measure area . Our protocol utilize Primos ½ face system produce 3-dimensional evaluation large area . This produce excellent reproducible result well outstanding photograph patient demonstration . Sculptra™ injectable implant contains microparticles poly-L-lactic acid , biocompatible , biodegradable , synthetic polymer alpha-hydroxy-acid family . Sculptra™ reconstitute prior use addition sterile water injection , USP ( SWFI ) form sterile non-pyrogenic suspension . Comparison : Dermik 's Vega Study - The Vega study 96-week , open-label , uncontrolled , single-center study determine treatment effect Sculptra sign lipoatrophy face 50 patient infected human immunodeficiency virus . Patients mean age 45 year ( range 33-58 ) , 84 % Caucasian 98 % male . All patient little adipose tissue cheek area baseline , indicate severe facial lipoatrophy ( mean adipose thickness 0.5±0.7 mm , range 0.0 2.1 mm ) . Treatment injection session conduct approximately two-week interval , majority ( 86 % ) patient receive four five injection session . Generally , one vial product inject intradermally multiple point cheek injection session . The quantity inject product number injection session depend upon severity facial depression . All patient experience increase skin thickness treatment area ( minimum increase 2.2 mm note Week 8 visit ) . Statistically significant increase baseline value mean skin thickness note time point ( Weeks 8 , 24 , 48 , 72 96 ) study . Increases mean skin thickness change baseline persist 2 year . This study follow general design Vega study .</detailed_description>
