	<brief_summary>Because adherence postnatal care guideline across United States ( U.S. ) poor , newborns mother often place undue risk adverse medical social outcome . This study aim evaluate alternative model care improve healthcare delivery reduce health disparity `` well '' newborns mother hospital discharge use single postnatal home nurse visit . The principal investigator previously show reduction poor outcome infant receive home visit discharge study retrospectively . The propose research build previous study prospectively evaluate impact single home nursing visit morbidities health disparity newborns mother randomize , control trial involve 1154 mother/infant breastfeed dyad . Home visit guarantee detailed assessment at-risk period infancy motherhood , medical social problem recognize , anticipate , and/or treat , bridge gap hospital care primary care . The investigator ' program , The Nurses Infants Through Teaching Assessment NurserY ( NITTANY ) Initiative , also consider cost-effectiveness home visitation compare guidelines-adherent outpatient clinic care .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In NITTANY Initiative effectiveness single postnatal/postpartum home nurse visit evaluate prospectively compare outpatient clinic-based care use randomize , control study design . We attempt reduce morbidity neonatal/postpartum period use well-timed home visit measure first reduction need additional hospital service ( inpatient hospitalization ED visitation ) first 14 day delivery . While healthcare utilization may important health outcome newborns mother long-term perspective , demographic group at-risk outcome tend parallel great long-term risk . Also , short-term outcome may costly one insurance provider use cost-effectiveness analysis justify home nurse visit . Readmissions use urgent care also may noticeable outcome clinician , help modify practice pattern improve compliance guideline healthcare delivery . Over 3-year period prospectively enroll cohort 1154 `` well '' singleton newborns mother admit hospital nursery at-risk readmission base demographic feature . Previous data indicate great risk adverse health outcome infants born breastfeed mother less parenting experience . Minorities Medicaid recipient likely suffer healthcare disparity . For mother , morbidity may occur socioeconomic group , undergo operative delivery instrument assist vaginal delivery tend suffer great morbidity . In study , patient randomize receive usual , guideline adherent , post-discharge care without home nurse visit 1-2 day nursery discharge . For newborn mother , information pregnancy , obstetrical record , nursery course collect . Data also record regard continuity care perinatal period , hospital readmission , ED visit , compliance extent outpatient care , satisfaction convenience care , cost healthcare . Method infant feeding , maternal confidence , maternal depression anxiety , satisfaction care also assess . To accomplish objective project , focus follow 3 specific aim : SPECIFIC AIM 1 . Establish single home nursing visit improve healthcare delivery reduce adverse health outcome breastfeed newborn . This model home visitation show reduce postnatal morbidity , improve compliance post-discharge guideline , reduce disparity health outcome enrol prospective trial base data present Preliminary Studies conduct PI . A randomized , controlled trial conduct period 36 month demonstrate infant receive single home visit reduce need subsequent hospital-based non-scheduled urgent care service . Secondary outcome importance include compliance follow-up guideline breastfeed rate also expect improve receive home visit . SPECIFIC AIM 2 . Establish single home nursing visit improve healthcare delivery reduce adverse outcome mother breastfeed newborn . Maternal readmission , emergency department utilization , need non-scheduled urgent care service reduce group woman receive single , postpartum home visit compare standard care . Additionally , parent sense competence , satisfaction postpartum healthcare , level perceive social support , incidence postpartum depression anxiety improve among woman randomize receive home nursing visit stressful emotional period follow childbirth compare randomized receive home visit . SPECIFIC AIM 3 . Prospectively evaluate cost-effectiveness single postnatal home nursing visit maternity/nursery hospital discharge . Data trial use perform stochastic cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrate prospectively single home nursing visit cost-effective base upon reduction need subsequent hospital non-scheduled urgent care base service ( inpatient , emergency department , outpatient ) newborns mother first 14 postnatal/postpartum day . Again base previous retrospective study conduct PI , home visit expect cost-effective intervention . Other factor include maternal health outcome , breastfeed , long-term health social outcome assess term relationship cost .</detailed_description>
