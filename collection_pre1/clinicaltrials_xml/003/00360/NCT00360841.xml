	<brief_title>Stimulation Auricular Acupuncture-Point Chemotherapy-Induced Nausea/Vomiting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chemotherapy-induced nausea vomiting ( CINV ) two commonly report adverse effect chemotherapy . Uncontrolled CINV reduces quality life , lead delay treatment , cause serious metabolic disturbance . Current strategy prevent acute CINV include combination therapy 5-HT3 antagonist corticosteroid moderately-high highly emetogenic chemotherapy . Similarly , strategy aim reduce incidence severity delay CINV include combination corticosteroid either dopamine receptor antagonist 5-HT3 antagonist 3-5 day post chemotherapy . Complete protection vomit first 24 hour achieve many 70-90 % patient receive moderately-high highly emetogenic chemotherapy ; however , standard antiemetic protect 50 % patient experience nausea acute CINV phase . Delayed nausea vomit less well define control , many 50 % patient experience nausea vomit 3 5 day period follow first day chemotherapy . Both acute delayed CINV remain significant problem patient undergo high-dose chemotherapy autologous allogeneic transplantation 90 % patient experience CINV despite prophylactic strategy . Additional pharmacological intervention clearly need optimize control CINV . Neurokinin-1 receptor ( NK-1 ) antagonists report improve total control rate acute CINV approximately 25 % compare standard combination 5-HT3 antagonist dexamethasone alone . Cocquyt et al. , report one dose NK-1 antagonist administer prior cisplatin-based chemotherapy prevent delayed emesis 72 % patient . Although promising , role agent CINV prevention control yet undetermined . Acupuncture constitute nonpharmacological intervention CINV . Chinese medicine hold stimulate select point body ear , lie along meridian life channel , relieve disease . From previous study , P6 point , also know Neiguan point G-Jo point . 10 , locate 2 cun ( Chinese inch , equivalent width individual 's thumb ) proximal distal wrist crease , tendon palmaris longus flexor carpus radialis . P6 acupuncture show reduce incidence severity nausea vomit postoperative setting , morning sickness , P6 transcutaneous electrical stimulation ( TCES ) therapy show enhance antiemetic action ondansetron patient receive highly emetic chemotherapy treatment . Auricular acupuncture consist needle insertion one ear four point : ( 1 ) sympathetic — locate terminal inferior antihelix crus ; ( 2 ) stomach —located around area helix crus terminates ; ( 3 ) shinmoon — locate bifurcate point superior inferior antihelix crus lateral 1/3 triangular fossa ; ( 4 ) occiput — locate posterior superior corner lateral aspect antitragus report effective reducing PONV . The purpose study evaluate auricular acupuncture antiemetic treatment compare sham acupuncture acupuncture patient receive moderately-high highly emetogenic chemotherapy . The study three group , randomize , examiner-blind , crossover control trial . It evaluate efficacy safety auricular acupuncture patient receive moderately-high highly emetogenic chemotherapy National Taiwan University Hospital . 120 eligible patient receive moderately-high highly emetogenic chemotherapy fulfill inclusion/exclusion criterion complete informed consent form recruit . After washout period 2 week , subject require take medication prevent acute CINV include combination therapy 5-HT3 antagonist corticosteroid moderately-high highly emetogenic chemotherapy . The patient divide three group ( auricular acupuncture treatment group , sham auricular acupuncture treatment group , non-treatment group ) order test effectiveness auricular acupuncture . Group 1 patient receive treatment ( control ) , completion 1st chemotherapy course , Group 2 patient receive auricular acupuncture treatment 2nd 4th chemotherapy course receive sham auricular acupuncture 3rd chemotherapy course , Group 3 receive sham auricular acupuncture 2nd 4th chemotherapy course receive auricular acupuncture 3rd chemotherapy course . At baseline visit course 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 chemotherapy , every subject efficacy evaluation FILE , vomit visual analog scare , WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire Chinese Disposition Classification . Simultaneously , monitor vital sign , complete blood count , urinalysis , biochemical indicator baseline visit end trial . The collect data analyze SAS 8.2 package .</detailed_description>
