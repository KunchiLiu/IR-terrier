	<detailed_description>Overweight obesity common metabolic disorder affect U.S. 31 % adult 16 % adolescent meeting Centers Disease Control criteria condition . As obesity epidemic unfold , increase prevalence abnormality carbohydrate metabolism . The single effective treatment type 2 diabetes severely obese adult may bariatric surgery , procedure commonly perform 5th 6th decade life . While clear rapid profound weight loss significantly improve carbohydrate metabolism adult , clear degree type 2 diabetes reversible patient . The pathophysiology type 2 diabetes adolescent child well understood study yet examine effect surgical weight loss insulin resistance , insulin secretion , glucose tolerance severely obese young people . However , seem likely bariatric surgery could improve condition youth . Understanding relative benefit surgically induce weight reduction carbohydrate metabolism adolescent compare old subject important determine optimal timing intervention . This knowledge may also lead key insight obesity-induced diabetes . In project test hypothesis bariatric surgical intervention effectively improve insulin resistance , β cell dysfunction , glucose tolerance adolescent compare adult . Three specific aim propose : 1 ) To compare derangement carbohydrate metabolism among severely obese ( body mass index ≥ 40 kg/m2 ) adolescents adult refer bariatric surgery ; 2 ) To assess improvement carbohydrate metabolism longitudinally ( surgical weight loss ) compare difference mechanisms improvement two age group ; 3 ) To compare major complication two age group follow bariatric surgery . These data provide critical information age-related metabolic outcome bariatric surgery could inform design large study examine role early bariatric surgery management disorder related insulin resistance patient high risk condition .</detailed_description>
