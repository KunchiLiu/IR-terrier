	<brief_title>Phase II Study Irinotecan HCI Recurrent Anaplastic Astrocytomas , Mixed Malignant Gliomas , Oligodendrogliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase 2 trial explore efficacy safety irinotecan ( CPT-11 ) patient recurrent anaplastic astrocytomas ( AA ) , mixed malignant glioma , oligodendrogliomas ( OA ) . Patients stratify tumor histology treat CPT-11 every 21 day ( treatment cycle ) . Baseline data ( collect &lt; 14 day ) consist neurological/oncological history , neurological examination , height , weight , performance status , Quality Of Life FACT-L questionnaire , laboratory study include complete blood count ( CBC ) , differential , platelet , prothrombin time ( PT ) , complete metabolic panel ( CMP ) , Lactose dehydrogenase ( LDH ) , pregnancy test , well cranial Computerized Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( CT/MRI ) without contrast ( measure evaluate size location tumor treatment ) . Administered every 21 day dose irinotecan ( CPT-11 ) , zofran/Kytril/Anzemet , decadron , intravenous ( IV ) atropine . At cycle , patient exam interview well lab result help research team determine symptomatic side effect treatment . Recorded past toxicity compare current side effect . Between day 15-21 ( within 7 day next schedule CPT-11 treatment ) follow test repeat - neurological/oncological history neurological examination , weight , blood drawn ( CMP , LDH ) , performance status , Quality Of Life FACT-L questionnaire . Also , MRI ( Cranial CT/MRI without contrast ) perform tumor assessment week 9 , 18 , 27 , 36 , every nine week thereafter progression . Response measure reduction tumor size . These supportive therapy provide necessary : - Antiemetic Therapy - Anticholinergics - Loperamide ( ImodiumÂ® ) - Growth Factors - Other Concomitant Medications</detailed_description>
