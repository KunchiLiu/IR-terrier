	<brief_summary>Randomised , double-blind , double dummy , parallel group design . Following screening period patient randomise baseline visit , 1:1:1 manner , one three treatment arm ; 4 mg E2007 , 200 mg entacapone ( dose levodopa ) placebo . The first 4 week double blind phase use titrate patient E2007 arm 2 mg maintenance dose 4 mg . Patients randomise entacapone placebo dummy titration maintain blind . Following titration phase , patient remain maintenance dose 14 week . Patients visit 2 , 4 , 6 , 10 , 14 18 week baseline . A follow visit perform Week 22 . A home diary complete patient rate either : 1 . `` OFF '' 2 . `` ON '' without dyskinesias 3 . `` ON '' non-troublesome dyskinesia 4 . `` ON '' troublesome dyskinesias 5 . Asleep These entry complete every 30 minute wake day complete three consecutive day immediately prior visit Baseline , Weeks 6 , 10 , 18 22 . At Baseline ( Day 0 ) , week 10 18 Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS - Parts I , II , III IV ) perform . At end treatment period ( Week 18 ) , patient undergo final efficacy safety assessment stop take study medication receive . They see 4 week later follow visit .</brief_summary>
