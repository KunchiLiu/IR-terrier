	<brief_title>Revlimid Patients With Acute Myelogenous Leukemia Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Revlimid design change body 's immune system . It may also interfere development tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . It possible may help reduce prevent growth cancer cell . You bone marrow aspiration perform start treatment ( within 4 week ) study 12 week start treatment study . Your doctor may also decide perform bone marrow aspiration 12 week assess response treatment . To collect bone marrow aspirate , area hip chest bone numb anesthetic , small amount bone marrow withdrawn large needle . If find eligible take part study , take Revlimid day mouth ( full glass water , least 1 hour meal ) 21 day . You 7 day study drug , consider rest period . This entire period consider 1 cycle therapy ( 28 day ) . The number treatment cycle may depend response disease treatment study . You blood draw ( 3 tablespoon ) test blood count chemistry treatment cycle . At end 3 cycle , disease evaluate response study treatment . You require return M. D. Anderson month first 3 month study often study doctor think best . After first 3 month study , may blood drawn ( 3 tablespoon ) blood count chemistry regular doctor 's office . The result blood test send research nurse . Your side effect review doctor nurse telephone ( addition review study diary ) start cycle treatment . This phone call last 10 minute time . You take study disease get bad experience intolerable side effect . It also possible study doctor may decide take study disease response consider less complete response . You end-of-study visit , take study reason . During end-of-study visit , blood drawn ( 3 tablespoon ) blood count chemistry . You ECG . You may urine pregnancy test . You also bone marrow aspiration perform . This investigational study . Revlimid® ( lenalidomide ) indicate treatment patient transfusion-dependent anemia due Low- Intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndrome associate deletion 5q cytogenetic abnormality without additional cytogenetic abnormality . Revlimid® also approve combination dexamethasone treatment patient multiple myeloma receive least one prior therapy . In case consider investigational . Up 30 patient take part study . All enrol M. D. Anderson .</detailed_description>
