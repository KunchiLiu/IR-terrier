	<brief_summary>Sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB ) recently emerge less invasive alternative axillary lymph node dissection ( ALND ) treatment breast cancer . However , SLNB number limitation , believe alternative strategy stag axilla explore . The hypothesis proposal combination preoperative high-resolution axillary ultrasound ( AUS ) , fine needle aspiration biopsy ( FNAB ) , molecular analysis use real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) represent viable , minimally invasive alternative SLNB . We propose prospective cohort study rigorously assess diagnostic accuracy molecular analysis AUS-FNAB specimen . The primary endpoint study determine feasibility AUS-FNAB real-time RT-PCR predict pathologic status axilla proof-of-principle study . In short term , validation innovative strategy likely reduce number sentinel node procedure . In long term , believe AUS-FNAB may ultimately replace SLNB .</brief_summary>
