	<brief_summary>The purpose study establish retrospectively nationwide registry patient suffer drug-induced liver injury ( DILI ) , collect , immortalize store serum , DNA , lymphocytes patient . ILIAD serve resource subsequent mechanistic investigation basis severe idiosyncratic DILI . The primary goal ILIAD protocol create : ( ) clinical database consist individual experience severe DILI cause four specific drug , relevant clinical data concern episode DILI ; , ( b ) create bank biological specimen obtain individual . These biological specimen DNA , plasma , immortalize lymphocyte . Immortalized lymphocyte provide unlimited amount genomic DNA study well live immune cell phenotyping study . A secondary goal ILIAD protocol maintain registry case ILIAD database may recontacted future . It expect facilitate additional study explore mechanisms DILI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Drug-Induced Liver Injury ( DILN ) Network Retrospective</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Drug-induced liver injury ( DILI ) single common reason regulatory action concern drug , include failure gain approval marketing , removal market place , restriction prescribe indication . DILI also significant cause morbidity mortality many patient population . To stimulate facilitate research DILI , National Institute Diabetes Digestive Kidney Diseases ( NIDDK ) recently establish Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network ( DILIN ) . One initial project conduct network retrospectively establish nationwide registry patient suffer severe idiosyncratic liver injury associate drug ( ILIAD ) HDS agent , collect , immortalize store serum , DNA , lymphocytes patient ( hereafter refer `` ILIAD protocol '' ) . This ILIAD protocol serve resource subsequent mechanistic investigation basis susceptibility severe idiosyncratic DILI . The network initially identify people develop DILI onset beyond 6 month enrollment due drug HDS/CAM case meet entrance criterion Prospective study . The specific aim follow : 1 . Establish maintain clinical database people contain relevant clinical data . 2 . Establish bank biological specimen ( serum , DNA , immortalized lymphocyte ) prepared case control clinical database . 3 . Maintain registry include yearly update contact information subject enrol clinical database possible recontact individual later date offer participation study part current proposal .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Screening Criteria To include ILIAD registry , follow criterion must satisfy : The treat gastroenterologist / hepatologist health care professional must believe subject suffer druginduced liver injury ; The subject must alive date onset qualify DILI episode must occur January 1 , 1994 ; Evidence injury know suspect related consumption drug HDS/CAM product The subject take one drug HDS agent ( ) period lead onset qualify DILI episode ; Have clinically important DILI define term serum aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , alkaline phosphatase ( Alk Phos ) . Sufficient documentation event Causality Committee make determination . Subjects exclude accord follow criterion : willing medical information blood sample take ; unable adequately give informed consent participate study include blood draw genetic component ; age &lt; 2 year old time study enrollment ( due blood volume requirement ) . Have compete cause liver injury hepatic ischemia investigator felt primary reason observe liver injury . Known , preexist autoimmune hepatitis ; primary biliary cirrhosis , primary sclerosing cholangitis , chronic biliary tract disease . Subjects excluded due acetaminophen hepatoxicity liver transplant allogeneic bone marrow transplant prior development drugCAM induce liver injury .</criteria>
