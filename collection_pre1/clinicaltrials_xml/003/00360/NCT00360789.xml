	<brief_title>Evaluation Whether Functional Strength Training Can Enhance Motor Recovery Upper Limb After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuromuscular weakness occur frequently stroke process underlying recovery still poorly understood . Accepted practice UK physiotherapy avoid training muscle strength stroke preliminary evidence might effective . An observer-blind randomised pilot clinical trial ( Phase II ) . Subjects within 3 month first stroke voluntary movement paretic upper limb . A Research Physiotherapist , blind measurement , recruit subject , allocate subject one three intervention group use sequentially number sealed envelope contain previously allocate intervention card provide intervention . Ten participant recruit group therefore trial recuit 30 participant . The Research Assessor , blind intervention allocation undertake measurement . Conventional therapy ( control ) provide normal clinical setting , additional conventional therapy ( experimental 1 ) functional strength training ( experimental 2 ) provide one hour , five time week six week . Subjects two experimental group also receive conventional therapy standard clinical setting . Blinded measurement make randomisation , end intervention 12-weeks thereafter . Primary outcomes Action Research Arm Test ( ARAT ) Nine Hole Peg Test ( 9HPT ) . The secondary outcome peak torque around elbow joint elbow flexion extension , grip force , pinch force , smoothness movement turn crank wheel reciprocal inniveration biceps triceps turn crank wheel . Data analyse use descriptive statistic estimation standard deviation use inform power calculation estimate sample size Phase II randomise control trial .</detailed_description>
