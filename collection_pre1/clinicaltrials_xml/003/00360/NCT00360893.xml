	<brief_summary>OBJECTIVE— The Diabetes Control Complications Trial ( DCCT ) demonstrate powerful impact glycemic control early manifestation microvascular complication . Contemporary prospective data evolution macrovascular late micro vascular complication type 1 diabetes limit . The Epidemiology Diabetes Interventions Complications ( EDIC ) study multicenter , longitudinal , observational study design use well-characterized DCCT cohort 1,400 patient determine long-term effect prior separation glycemic level micro- macrovascular outcome . EDIC 13th year followup . The study expect last 2016 . RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS— Using standardized annual history physical examination , 28 EDIC clinical center DCCT clinic follow EDIC cohort 10 year . Annual evaluation also include rest electro c rdiogram , Doppler ultrasound measurement ankle/arm blood pressure , screen nephropathy . At regular interval , time 4-h urine collect , lipid pro file obtain , stereoscopic fundus photograph take . In addition , dual B-mode Doppler ultrasound scan common internal carotid artery perf rmed year 1 6 study end .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>During DCCT , frequency cardiovascular event low determine whether intervention significantly different effect . During EDIC , two measure atherosclerosis employ , ultrasound measurement carotid intima-media wall thickness ( IMT ) electron beam ( multidetector ) compute tomography heart measure coronary artery calcification . The progression IMT EDIC decrease former intensive therapy group compare former conventional therapy group . Similarly , prevalence coronary calcification less former intensive treatment group . Both measure associate level glycemia , measure HbA1c , DCCT , independent establish cardiovascular risk factor . The frequency major CVD clinical event ( define one following : fatal non-fatal myocardial infarction stroke , silent myocardial infarction , angina confirm positive stress test catheterization , PTCA CABG ) increase EDIC . Preliminary analysis clinical event show difference two DCCT treatment group support benefit intensive therapy clinical CVD outcome , previously demonstrate atherosclerosis . Collaboration Medical University South Carolina , support NHLBI Program Project , explore inflammatory , lipid , hemorheologic risk factor micro- macrovascular disease EDIC . The rate mortality DCCT cohort low . The number event small provide definitive assessment possible effect initial intensive versus conventional therapy DCCT risk mortality , assess association complication , principally nephropathy , risk mortality . However , projection next 10 year suggest adequate number death expect allow assessment effect previous DCCT therapy , history glycemia emergence complication risk mortality . COLLABORATIONS- The DCCT/EDIC Research Group seek amplify clinical science opportunity afford extensive clinical data collect DCCT/EDIC . Four important collaboration extend expand collection data relevant CVD . 1 . Our collaborator The Medical University South Carolina ( MUSC ) obtain 3 sample specially preserve plasma different time point approximately 1000 EDIC participant measurement multiple risk factor , include nuclear magnetic resonance lipoprotein profile . Many assay already perform await correlation analyse CVD event surrogates . 2 . Our collaborator University Washington receive serum 85-90 % participant every 2 year throughout DCCT EDIC fractionation lipoproteins gradient ultracentrifugation . One MUSC collaborator , University Oklahoma , add characterization apoproteins important lipoprotein metabolism . 3 . In addition biochemical data generate collaborator MUSC University Washington , DCCT/EDIC Genetics Project initiate . ( A proposal continuation genetics project submit separately ) . Our collaborator Hospital Sick Children/University Toronto receive DNA virtually participant 2918 first degree relative , represent 87 % relative available refuse provide DNA outright ( 25 % relative ) . Genetic analysis gene influence CVD conduct 3 approach : population base association DCCT/EDIC probands candidate gene ; `` trio '' analysis probands parent sibling ; family base association multiplex family relatives also previously clinically phenotyped complication . 4 . A collaboration investigator locate several center , include UCSF , focus urologic sexual dysfunction diabetes ( Uro-EDIC ) yield important new insight . In addition major , planned collaboration , DCCT/EDIC Research Group make phenotypic data save sample available outside investigator almost decade . The DCCT/EDIC Research Group also collaborate repository recently establish NIDDK share phenotypic data , genetic sample , biologic sample , available , external investigator .</detailed_description>
