	<brief_title>Paleolithic Diet Exercise Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because genetic evolutionary change occur slowly Homo sapiens , traditional diet Homo sapiens underwent dramatic change within recent time , modern human well physiologically adapt diet similar one hominid ancestor evolve diet typical modern industrialize society . The investigator develop computational model estimate net acid load diet nutrient composition diet 's component ingredient , suggest majority hominid diet yield negative net acid load ( , yield net base load ) , addition low sodium chloride , high potassium-containing fruit vegetable , low saturate fat , majority non-animal-source calorie come fruit vegetable , acid-producing grain , separate fat oil , starch refine sugar . According paleonutritionists , Homo sapiens ' recent switch ancestral Paleolithic-type diet modern Western diet contribute major way so-called age-related disease civilization . The investigator hypothesize test whether : 1. consume high-potassium , low-sodium , net base-producing `` Paleolithic-type '' diet , even short term , detectable beneficial effect cardiovascular physiology , serum lipid profile , insulin sensitivity , exercise performance ; 2. computational model predicts measure negative net acid load net base-producing `` Paleolithic-type '' diet , use steady-state value renal net acid excretion measure diet net acid load ( a.k.a. , net endogenous acid production ) , value construct net-base produce diet modern consumption . The long term complication combination high blood pressure , high blood sugar high fat cholesterol level , sometimes call `` metabolic syndrome '' , term number one medical problem modern society today . If eating `` Paleolithic '' diet help improve disease , would first step improve people 's health get old well contribute future national dietary guideline Americans .</detailed_description>
