	<brief_summary>This study explore ability algae ( ocean plant ) omega-3 fat supplement ( DHA ) reduce triglyceride level patient currently treat statin therapy ( Zocor simvastatin , Lipitor atorvastatin , Pravachol pravastatin , Crestor rosuvastatin , etc . ) coronary artery disease ( CAD ) risk equivalent ( follow : heart attack , post angioplasty stent , post coronary bypass surgery , angina , vascular disease , stroke diabetes ) . The rationale study base around find patient CAD approximately 20 % reduction risk sudden death treat fish oil ( DHA one ingredients fish oil ) . In study statin-based therapy , observe statin reduce risk coronary event 20-45 % . There yet research trial explore combination two ingredient ( i.e. , DHA plus statin ) patient treatment either reduce recurrent cardiac event address another report find fish oil low triglyceride level ( triglyceride form `` blood fat '' ) . This research project pilot project ass safety effectiveness DHA `` add-on '' therapy patient currently treat statin CAD . The study hypothesis test effectiveness DHA compare placebo lower triglyceride level blood . This double-blinded randomized clinical trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Triglyceride Lowering Effect Omega-3 Fat ( DHA ) Addition Statin Therapy Patients With CAD Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Omega-3 fatty acid ( nPUFAs ) embrace Expert Panels Guideline Committees American Heart Association result randomize trial document reduction cardiovascular event patient coronary artery disease . The antiarrhythmic effect modification atherogenicity lipoprotein particles nPUFA treatment speculate mechanisms action . Although precise bioactivity clear , nPUFAs demonstrate low triglyceride ( TG ) level . TG reduction also demonstrate three randomized clinical trial nPUFAs form fish oil contain eicosapentanoic acid ( EPA ) docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) add ongoing statin therapy . There least 8 large randomize clinical trial utilized statin agent monotherapy reduce cardiovascular event patient CAD . These trial include 50,000 patient . The National Cholesterol Education Program ( NCEP ) recently release `` white paper '' reduce LDL treatment target 70 mg % result four recently publish trial . Although cardiovascular event rate mortality reduction 20-30 % described , still sizable number patient experience untoward outcome spite ongoing statin therapy . A variety mechanisms disease progression speculate include ongoing inflammation , insulin resistance specific specie lipoprotein particle include HDL LDL sub-classes . There recognition NCEP beyond treatment statin therapy less tested method therapy might need apply . These therapy include lower triglyceride . It purpose pilot study explore relationship DHA strategy triglyceride lower CAD patient receive on-going statin therapy candidate yet ( untested ) recommendation NCEP need low triglyceride level exceed 200 mg % statin-treated individual . 1 . This single-center , prospective , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , parallel-group clinical trial Martek 's DHASCOâ„¢ versus placebo subject CAD risk equivalent ( include type II DM ) 2 . There 4-wk run-in period assure diet triglyceride stabilization . 3 . After base-line run-in period , triglyceride level exceed 200 mg % eligible procede intervention either placebo 2 gram DHA 4 . Patients treat 8 week period . Visits occur every week treatment cycle . 5 . Laboroatory parameter follow course clinical trial include : beta quantification lipid , NMR particle analysis lipoprotein particle size , apoprotein genotyping basic chemistry measurement</detailed_description>
