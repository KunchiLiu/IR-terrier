	<brief_summary>People cystic fibrosis ( CF ) often develop chronic pulmonary infection cause variety organism , predominant Pseudomonas aeruginosa . Antibiotics important manage CF lung infection . Antibiotic use CF alter ten year ago approval inhale tobramycin , aminoglycoside effective treat P. aeruginosa . A decade later , CF clinicians increasingly concerned likelihood induction aminoglycoside-resistance prolong use inhaled tobramycin treat chronic P. aeruginosa airway infection . The goal study examine current microbiology susceptibility organisms CF sputum , correlate antibiotic use , compare previous data .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aminoglycosides one mainstays antibiotic therapy CF . They administer parenterally synergistic combination Î²-lactam antibiotic acute exacerbation use inhalation single agent chronic maintenance therapy . It well know CF chronic infection chronic use antibiotic result resistance . Thus , increase use aminoglycosides could dramatically change microbiological epidemiology CF , since last examine decade ago . It important determine current prevalence antibiotic resistance CF pathogens . Current antimicrobial strategy may also contribute increase rate isolation novel difficult treat organism , include intrinsically antibiotic-resistant bacteria . These issue important CF clinicians researcher develop new antimicrobial use CF . To determine prevalence P. aeruginosa resistance prevalence CF pathogens change past ten year , multi-center cross-sectional study enroll contemporary cohort patient CF compare sputum microbiology susceptibility data correspond baseline data historical cohort consist patient enrol prior phase 3 trial inhale tobramycin , conduct PathoGenesis Corporation . ( A Phase III Placebo Controlled Clinical Trial ( PC-TNDS-002 ) Study Safety Efficacy Tobramycin Inhalation Patients Cystic Fibrosis ) . The data set phase 3 trial use research project anonymous . This current study coordinate CF research team CHRMC aim enroll 520 patient approximately 50 participate site across United States . The contemporary cohort include patient CF age 6 year older able expectorate sputum . Patients enrol many CF center participate phase 3 trial inhale tobramycin , eligibility criterion similar use phase 3 trial . Subjects enrol contemporary cohort single study visit obtain sputum sample send central laboratory culture susceptibility testing .</detailed_description>
