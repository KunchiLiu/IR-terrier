	<brief_title>Tipifarnib Treating Patients With Anemia Neutropenia Large Granular Lymphocyte Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate complete response rate , partial response rate , overall response rate patient natural killer ( NK ) - T-cell-large granular lymphocyte ( LGL ) leukemia present neutropenia anemia treat tipifarnib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine toxicity tipifarnib patient . II . Determine mechanism treatment responses patient correlative laboratory study . OUTLINE : Patients stratify disease type ( natural killer-large granular lymphocyte [ LGL ] leukemia v T-cell-LGL leukemia ) . Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients evaluated completion course 4 . Patients achieve complete response receive 1 additional course treatment . Patients achieve partial response receive 4 additional course treatment absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood collection periodically study response mechanism study biomarker correlative study , include mutation K-ras N-ras gene . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
