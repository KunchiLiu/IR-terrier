	<brief_summary>The aim study quantify effect IVIG treatment group patient chronic inflammatory demyelinate polyradiculoneuropathy ( CIDP ) , require continue treatment IVIG regular interval 3-10 week : 1 . During continue treatment IVIG regular interval 3-10 week . 2 . During pause treatment . Hypothesis : 1 . The disease activity patient cyclical correlate treatment interval . 2 . Pause treatment increase disease activity , quantify symptom score , disability scale , clinical test . Primary effect parameter muscle strength quantify isokinetic dynamometry . Added protocol immunological study inflammatory marker blood sample patient treatment pause .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Chronic inflammatory demyelinate polyradiculoneuropathy ( CIDP ) rare autoimmune disease peripheral nervous system characterize demyelination nerve , cause muscle weakness sensory loss . Treatment immune modulating , intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) first line therapy.Several trial demonstrate effect motor function initial treatment , effect consecutive IVIG treatment sporadic described literature . It clinical study include present CIDP patient treatment University Hospital Aarhus . The patient evaluate several time IVIG treatment , describe effect profile . The primary effect parameter muscle strength quantify isokinetic dynamometry ankle knee , hip , wrist , elbow shoulder . That sensitive method measure strength large muscle group , correlate symptom sign neuropathy . Severity neuropathy among patient also describe apply nerve conduction study , quantitative sensory test threshold detect vibration cold upper low limb , Neuropathy Disability Scale , Neuropathy Symptom Score , overall disability sum score , 9 hole peg test , walk test , Short-form 36 health questionnaire . Added protocol immunological study inflammatory marker blood sample patient treatment pause . Objective : With study describe important aspect immune response cause inflammatory lesion CIDP MMN , include : 1 . Recruitment immune cell affect tissue chemoattraction . ( Chemokine receptor mononuclear cell ) 2 . Crossing blood-nerve barrier : interaction adhesion lymphocyte endothelial cell , transendothelial diapedesis enzymatic degeneration basal lamina . ( Adhesion molecule mononuclear cell soluble plasma , metalloproteinases ) 3 . Synthesis mRNA secretion regulatory cytokine .</detailed_description>
