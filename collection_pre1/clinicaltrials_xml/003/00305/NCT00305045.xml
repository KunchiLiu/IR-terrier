	<brief_summary>Studies explore efficacy repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) treatment refractory major depressive disorder ( MDD ) show significant promise . Despite , several question regard treatment parameter need optimize efficacy remain . Moreover , also lack clear understanding therapeutic mechanism involve . For example , several line evidence suggest patient MDD deficit cortical inhibition ( CI ) deficits key understand pathophysiology disorder . With study , seek confirm therapeutic potential acute course rTMS treatment-refractory MDD large sample patient . In addition , strive clarify neurophysiological mechanism rTMS exerts therapeutic effect , use TMS electroencephalography/event relate brain potential ( EEG/ERP ) measure neurophysiological activity . Moreover , study , intend investigate efficacy maintenance course rTMS effort prevent symptom recurrence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treating Refractory Major Depressive Disorder With Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) one prevalent mental illness North America , affect approximately 4 % Canadians annually . Though number effective treatment available , many 15 % diagnosed depressive disorder die suicide , 30 % fail respond treatment approximately 60 % experience relapse . These statistic emphasize need optimize treatment response , well understand neurobiological mechanism mediate MDD , order improve therapeutic outcome . To date , alternative available treatment refractory symptom - one alternative electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) ; however , treatment associate significant side effect , notably memory impairment . Also , ECT require use general anesthetic , , thus , relatively invasive procedure increase risk complication . In addition , stigma associate ECT often limit widespread acceptance treatment depressive symptom . rTMS show effective therapeutic tool treatment several neuropsychiatric disorder , include MDD schizophrenia . In MDD , two type rTMS treatment protocol show effective . These include high frequency ( 10Hz ) rTMS apply left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) ( HFL ) low frequency ( 1Hz ) rTMS apply right DLPFC ( LFR ) . More recently , preliminary study combine LFR rTMS HFL rTMS - effect , Bilateral rTMS - show method safe , well-tolerated , superior use either stimulation protocol alone . However , study demonstrate equivocal efficacy rTMS treatment MDD . Several methodological limitation , however , taint treatment study , preclude ability make definitive conclusion regard efficacy rTMS MDD . These limitation include : 1 ) small sample size ; 2 ) lack adequate double-blind condition ; 3 ) lack adequate treatment duration ; 4 ) bias randomization ; 5 ) patient heterogeneity ; 6 ) lack maintenance treatment protocol ; 7 ) unclear understand parameter necessary optimize treatment ; 8 ) insufficient understand neurophysiological mechanism mediate therapeutic efficacy rTMS treatment . With study , intend rectify methodological limitation : include large sample treatment refractory patient , meet pre-established criterion treatment resistance ; exclude patient comorbid Axis II psychopathology ; develop maintain randomize double-blind protocol prior study initiation ; extend active rTMS treatment course ; evaluate 2 different treatment protocol ; evaluate whether induction CI mediate therapeutic effect rTMS depressive symptom . With regard latter objective , several line evidence support hypothesis regard mechanistic role CI therapeutic effect rTMS . First , ECT-mediated increase EEG slow wave activity ( SWA ) cortical GABA patient MDD suggest enhance CI related clinical improvement . Second , MDD disorder associate deficit CI . Third , deficits CI , indexed cortical GABA , rectify supplement antidepressant medication . In addition , core deficit MDD - cognitive inhibition - conceptually relate impaired CI . Cognitive inhibition refers ability ignore inhibit mental event . Those MDD typically experience pronounce difficulty shift thought away negative idea . In fact , impaired cognitive inhibition depressogenic thought information propose mechanism and/or risk factor underlie development maintenance MDD . Research event-related potential ( ERP ) lab examine neurophysiological correlate CI healthy adult clinical group . During Stroop task , CI associate increase negative voltage shift peak 400 500 millisecond frontocentral region scalp , decrease positivity leave parietal region , refer N450 N500 . The experimental manipulation present study distinct ongoing MDD-ERP work ability examine change N450 response follow anticipated rTMS-induced improvement CI . Thus , rTMS bring improvement CI , CI relate cognitive inhibition , associate normalization N450 response MDD . Objectives 1 . To evaluate efficacy acute course rTMS treat patient treatment refractory MDD . 2 . To evaluate stimulus protocol demonstrate superior therapeutic efficacy . 3 . To evaluate whether induction CI mediate therapeutic effect rTMS treatment refractory MDD . 4 . To evaluate efficacy maintenance course rTMS , respond rTMS treatment , prevent recurrence depressive symptom . 5 . To measure whether change CI associate change cognitive inhibition relate emotional information , measure ERP Emotional Stroop Task . Hypotheses 1 . In acute treatment phase , active rTMS effective treat refractory MDD compare sham treatment . 2 . Bilateral HFL rTMS show superior therapeutic efficacy sham rTMS , although Bilateral rTMS show superior therapeutic efficacy compare HFL stimulation . 3 . The induction CI show mediate therapeutic effect rTMS refractory symptom patient MDD . 4 . Biweekly maintenance rTMS effective preventing relapse depressive symptom . 5 . Prior rTMS treatment , patient exhibit diminished neurophysiological index cognitive inhibition , measure N450 component ERP . If rTMS effectively increase CI , increase associate improvement cognitive inhibition , measure normalization N450 .</detailed_description>
