	<brief_summary>Hepatic encephalopathy ( HE ) frequent complication chronic liver disease ( cirrhosis ) involve wide spectrum problem mild impairment reaction time drive operate machinery disturbance mood , behaviour conscious level . Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) method obtain picture inside body . Patients liver disease previously study MRI highlight change brain . This research aim highlight difference way brain function patient liver disease . Using new , powerful MRI scanner , sophisticated technique hope novel combination MRI techniques objectively detect presence , monitor HE . Study hypothesis : Hepatic encephalopathy ( HE ) reversible , metabolic disturbance brain , associate low grade brain swell disturbance chemical balance within brain , result functional impairment , presence MR image detect sufficient sensitivity monitor change may occur time response treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hepatic encephalopathy ( HE ) common neuropsychiatric abnormality , complicate course liver disease patient . In UK , cirrhosis account 4000 death per year , 500,000 people thought infect chronic hepatitis C , 20 % develop cirrhosis 20 year . The condition difficult monitor objectively . Despite fact syndrome probably first recognise two thousand year ago , exact pathogenesis still remain unclear . It think represent reversible disturbance brain chemistry consequent brain swelling , response blood contain unfiltered gut-derived toxin enter cerebral circulation . There recognise 'gold standard ' test diagnose monitor important , disabling condition . I develop novel combination magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) sequence 3 Tesla study effect hepatic encephalopathy brain patient cirrhosis . We propose investigate alteration brain size , function chemistry , interval 4 week anti-encephalopathy treatment L-ornithine L-aspartate . This enable assessment baseline brain alteration cohort brain 's response therapy correlation clinical response . As longitudinal study would allow u define sensitivity MR technique . Each 50 patient blood test , 1 hour MRI brain scan psychometric testing . The psychometric testing perform computer-based battery conventional paer-based test . They give L-ornithine L-aspartate ( LOLA ) take orally 4 week repeat blood test , MRI psychometric test . We determine correlation MR data result psychometric test .</detailed_description>
