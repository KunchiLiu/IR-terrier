	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study bevacizumab see well work compare cetuximab give together gemcitabine , capecitabine , radiation therapy treat patient pancreatic cancer completely remove surgery . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Cetuximab may also stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving bevacizumab cetuximab together gemcitabine , capecitabine , radiation therapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . It yet know whether bevacizumab effective cetuximab give together gemcitabine , capecitabine , radiation therapy treat pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe toxicity profile cetuximab bevacizumab combine gemcitabine , capecitabine plus radiation capecitabine plus radiation patient completely-resected pancreatic carcinoma adjuvant setting . II . To assess safety profile either cetuximab bevacizumab plus gemcitabine patient resect pancreatic cancer . III . To obtain tissue specimen resection patient enrol study correlative study evaluation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate disease-free overall survival patient receive either cetuximab bevacizumab combination gemcitabine capecitabine plus radiation . II . To assess safety profile patient receive either capecitabine plus cetuximab plus radiation , capecitabine plus bevacizumab plus radiation . III . To correlate change serum amphiregulin TGF alpha survival , DFS rash patient receive cetuximab . IV . To determine 2-year survival rate patient receive either cetuximab plus gemcitabine capecitabine plus cetuximab plus radiation , bevacizumab plus gemcitabine capecitabine plus bevacizumab plus radiation . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord degree prior resection pancreatic tumor ( R0 v R1 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Arm I : Patients receive cetuximab IV 60-120 minute day 1 , weekly , week 1-24 ; gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , weekly , week 1-3 , 13-15 , 17-19 , 21-23 ; oral capecitabine twice daily day 1-5 , 5 day week , week 5-10 . Patients also undergo radiotherapy daily , 5 day week , begin week 5 continue approximately 5½ week ( 25 fraction ) . Arm II : Patients receive bevacizumab IV 60-90 minute day 1 week 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 13 , 15 , 17 , 19 , 21 , 23 . Patients also receive gemcitabine hydrochloride capecitabine undergo radiotherapy arm I . In arm , treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 3 year .</detailed_description>
