	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give bortezomib together gemcitabine work treat patient recurrent metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer . Bortezomib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving bortezomib together gemcitabine may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib Gemcitabine Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Nasopharyngeal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary I. Assess response probability ( confirm unconfirmed , complete partial response ) 3-month progression-free survival rate patient metastatic recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) treat bortezomib . Secondary I . Estimate 1-year progression-free survival ass quantitative toxicity group patient treat bortezomib . II . Evaluate response probability ( confirm unconfirmed , complete partial ) subset patient progress bortezomib , measurable disease time progression , go receive bortezomib gemcitabine hydrochloride combination therapy . III . Estimate 1-year overall survival patient treat regimen . IV . Estimate 6-month progression-free survival start combination therapy ass quantitative toxicity subset patient progress bortezomib receive combination therapy . V. Explore , preliminary manner , relationship change Epstein-Barr virus DNA level , NF-kB DNA-binding activity , methylation status E-cadherin promoter clinical outcome . OUTLINE : This multicenter study bortezomib . Patients receive bortezomib IV day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive 2 additional course treatment bortezomib . Patients experience disease progression single-agent bortezomib receive prior gemcitabine hydrochloride may begin combination therapy within 10-28 day last dose bortezomib . Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 8 bortezomib IV day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve CR receive 2 additional course beyond confirm CR . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 50 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
