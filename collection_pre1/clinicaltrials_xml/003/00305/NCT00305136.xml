	<detailed_description>The common prevalence painful syndrome follow surgical intervention injury call preventive therapeutic approach base well insight pain modulation mechanism patient . Recent advance field pain psychophysics enhance understand pain process nervous system seem characterize individual pattern pain processing , thereby enable prediction person ’ susceptibility develop chronic pain consequent surgery . In project , propose apply wide array advance test method order prospectively assess pain modulation pattern pain free patient undergo elective thoracotomy . Tests include : 1. psychophysical test : pain threshold suprathreshold magnitude estimation , temporal summation , endogenous analgesia – diffuse noxious inhibitory control ( DNIC ) ; 2. test interaction pain autonomic nervous system include inhibitory effect vagal activation pain perception , response pattern sympatho-parasympathetic balance noxious stimulation ; 3. evaluation personality component know associated chronic pain include anxiety , catastrophization somatization . Since half post-thoracotomy patient suffer chronic neuropathic postoperative pain , expect identify test predict risk pain relative power relevant test prediction , construct short applicable tool , 'pain susceptibility profile ' , reliably predict risk development pain . The contribution test severity acute postoperative pain , latter development chronic postoperative pain also evaluate . The expected result project serve pain prevention identifying patient risk tailor intervention reduce risk chronic pain . Also , wide pain research context , understand allow well design analysis study pain mechanisms therapy consider pain susceptibility participate patient .</detailed_description>
