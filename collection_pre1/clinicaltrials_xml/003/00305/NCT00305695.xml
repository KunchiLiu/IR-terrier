	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Zoledronate may prevent bone loss patient undergoing surgery remove ovary . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study zoledronate see well work compare observation maintain bone mineral density patient undergo surgery remove ovary .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zoledronate Observation Maintaining Bone Mineral Density Patients Who Are Undergoing Surgery Remove Both Ovaries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare effect zoledronate v observation bone loss associate surgery ( minimum , surgical procedure result removal ovary ) patient undergo excision ovary . Secondary - Compare change bone mineral density bilateral hip patient treat regimen . Tertiary - Compare effect zoledronate v observation biochemical marker bone resorption bone formation ( N-telopeptide bone specific alkaline phosphatase ) 1 year treatment . OUTLINE : This randomize , multicenter study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . All patient undergo surgery , removal ovary , month 1 . All patient request take calcium supplement twice daily multivitamin contain vitamin D daily begin month 1 continue 18 month . - Arm I : Beginning 60-90 day surgery , patient receive zoledronate IV 15 minute month 3 , 9 , 15 . - Arm II : Patients observe 18 month surgery . In arm , patient complete physical activity questionnaire baseline month 3 , 9 , 15 , 18 . Patients undergo bone mineral density test lumbar spine total hip baseline month 9 18 . Patients also undergo blood collection baseline periodically study biomarker study . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 222 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
