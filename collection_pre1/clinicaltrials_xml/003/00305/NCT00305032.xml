	<brief_title>Effect Endoscopic Gastric Balloon Insertion Obstructive Sleep Apnea Patients With Morbid Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most patient obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) obese . It note significant weight loss could improve severity sleep apnea . Significant weight loss difficult achieve especially morbidly obese patient . Endoscopic gastric balloon insertion minimally invasive procedure employ surgeon weight reduction morbidly obese patient . This study would assess parameter sleep could affect weight reduction . If result positive , procedure might consider treatment obstructive sleep apnea morbidly obese patient . Patient population would select patient would undergo gastric balloon insertion surgical department . There would sex age limit . Patient recruit would BMI &gt; 35 . Consent would sign sleep study . Baseline sleep study , lung function , Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) quality life would assess patient symptom suggestive OSA . If patient confirm OSA , continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) titration would offer patient willing try CPAP . Otherwise patient would discharge home wait balloon insertion . The assessment would repeat 3 month 6 month surgical procedure . All sleep study would do in-patient . Leptin ghrelin hormone control satiety , also relate degree obesity . Blood plasma leptin ghrelin would take 6 month gastric balloon insertion ass relationship weight reduction reduce appetite plasma level hormone</detailed_description>
