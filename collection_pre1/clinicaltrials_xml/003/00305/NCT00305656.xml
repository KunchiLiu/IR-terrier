	<brief_title>AZD2171 Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . Determine proportion patient recurrent glioblastoma multiforme ( GM ) alive progression free 6 month start AZD2171 therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess biological effect AZD2171 use follow MRI technique : dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging ; arterial spin-labeling imaging ; perfusion-weighted imaging ; diffusion- tensor image serial time point . II . Measure circulate endothelial progenitor cell plasma level tumstatin , ( vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) -A -D , sVEGF receptor , P1GF , platelet-derived growth factor ( PDGF ) -AA , PDGF-AB , PDGF-BB , Ang1 , thrombospondin-1 , interleukin-8 marker response antiangiogenic therapy recurrent GM . III . Correlate treatment outcomes pre-AZD2171 tumor specimen respect microvascular density , basement membrane pericyte coverage , angiopoietin-1 -2 expression determine whether immunohistochemical analysis predictive response AZD2171 . IV . Measure polymorphisms kdr/flk-1 gene genetic analysis HIF1-alpha , TP53 , endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene archival tumor specimen . V. Determine overall survival patient recurrent GM treat AZD2171 . VI . Determine radiographic response rate patient recurrent GM treat AZD2171 . VII . Determine safety AZD2171 patient population . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral AZD2171 daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 12 month .</detailed_description>
