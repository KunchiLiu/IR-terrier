	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine oxaliplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give gemcitabine together oxaliplatin work second-line therapy treat patient stage III stage IV non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Oxaliplatin Second-Line Therapy Treating Patients With Stage III Stage IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine efficacy safety gemcitabine hydrochloride oxaliplatin second-line chemotherapy patient stage IIIB IV non-small cell lung cancer . - Determine overall response patient treat regimen . Secondary - Determine time progression , time treatment failure , overall survival patient . - Determine type , frequency , severity , timing , relatedness adverse event treatment 30 day completion study treatment . - Assess quality life patient . - Determine expression RRM1 ERCC1 peripheral blood mononuclear cell patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , nonrandomized study . Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 100 minute follow oxaliplatin IV 2 hour day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline , begin course , completion study treatment , every 6 week thereafter . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
