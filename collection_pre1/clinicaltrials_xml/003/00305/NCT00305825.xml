	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some find tumor cell kill carry tumor-killing substance . Others interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy use letrozole may fight breast cancer lower amount estrogen body make . Giving bevacizumab together letrozole may effective treatment locally advance metastatic breast cancer . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give bevacizumab together letrozole work treat postmenopausal woman locally advance metastatic breast cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Letrozole Treating Postmenopausal Women With Locally Advanced Metastatic Breast Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine safety feasibility bevacizumab combination letrozole postmenopausal woman estrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-positive , unresectable , locally advanced metastatic breast cancer . Secondary - Determine response rate ( partial response [ PR ] complete response [ CR ] ) patient treat regimen . - Determine clinical benefit rate ( PR , CR , stabilization disease ≥ 24 week ) patient treat regimen . - Determine time progression patient treat regimen . - Determine duration response patient treat regimen . - Determine proportion patient treat regimen stable disease ≥ 24 week . - Determine molecular profile patient 's breast tumor explore relationship molecular characteristic response resistance treatment . - Obtain serial measurement ( pre- post-treatment ) circulate endothelial cell epithelial cell explore relationship cell serum marker angiogenesis response treatment . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 oral letrozole daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 42 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
