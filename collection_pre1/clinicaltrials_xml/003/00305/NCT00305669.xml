	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Colony-stimulating factor , GM-CSF , may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Giving GM-CSF surgery may effective treatment localize prostate cancer . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study well give GM-CSF surgery work treat patient localized prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>GM-CSF Before Surgery Treating Patients With Localized Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine safety tolerability daily neoadjuvant sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) patient localized prostate cancer undergo radical prostatectomy . - Determine whether tissue-specific antiprostate cancer immunity induce administration neoadjuvant GM-CSF patient localized prostate cancer prior radical prostatectomy . Secondary - Estimate baseline antitumor immune response patient treat 2 different dose schedule GM-CSF . - Determine magnitude difference immune response 2 dose schedule GM-CSF . - Determine clinical effect , include prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) decline , surgical outcome , surgical complication , histologic appearance surgical specimen , regimen patient . OUTLINE : This pilot study . Patients stratify accord sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) dose . Patients receive 1 2 dose level GM-CSF subcutaneously day 1-14 1-21 . Treatment continue absence unacceptable toxicity . Within 3 day last dose GM-CSF , patient undergo radical prostatectomy . Blood collect baseline , day 28 course , 4-week follow-up visit examine activated T-cells . Tissue collect surgery assess biomarkers cytokine . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 28 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
