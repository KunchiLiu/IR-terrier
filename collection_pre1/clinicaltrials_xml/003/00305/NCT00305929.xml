	<brief_title>Study WST09 Prostate Cancer After Radiation : Repeat Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multi-centre , phase II , open-label , 12-month clinical trial patient previously receive vascular-targeted photodynamic treatment ( VTP ) WST09 ( Tookad ) still histological finding ( prostate biopsy ) indicate presence localize cancer . The WST09-mediated VTP procedure consist I.V . infusion WST09 ( Tookad ) 2 mg/kg , combination per-cutaneous interstitial delivery monochromatic laser light ( wavelength 763nm ) via trans-perineal implantation illumination fibre , position prostatic lobe . In previous Tookad trial , escalate dos laser light use fix dose WST09 ( 2 mg/kg ) patient localize prostatic cancer . Patients underwent procedure still positive prostate biopsy ( residual cancer ) may benefit additional WTS09-mediated VTP procedure . Thus , aim study treat patient still present localize prostate cancer second WST09-mediated VTP procedure .</detailed_description>
