	<brief_title>Umbilical Cord Blood Infusion Treat Type 1 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : Our goal transfuse autologous umbilical cord blood 23 child T1D attempt re-establish immune tolerance perhaps regenerate pancreatic islet insulin-producing beta cell improve blood glucose control . As secondary goal , aim study potential change metabolism/immune function lead islet regeneration . Background/Rationale : Stem cell provide excite approach towards cure T1D . Autologous bone marrow transplant use successfully patient undergo high dose chemotherapy , variety cancer autoimmune disorder multiple sclerosis , lupus , rheumatic disorder . Recent study immunodeficient mice chemically-induced pancreatic damage show bone marrow-derived stem cell preferentially home pancreas may capacity initiate pancreatic regeneration , thereby restore endothelial interaction pancreas correct associate elevated blood sugar level Human umbilical cord blood cell transfuse model amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) result delayed disease progression two three week increase lifespan . Umbilical cord blood show promise excellent source derive stem cell population , use successfully transplantation variety disease , include acute lymphocytic myeloid leukemia , lymphoma , Fanconi anemia , sickle cell disease . Furthermore , umbilical cord blood-derived stem cell capacity differentiate variety non-blood cell type , include hepatocytes , neural cell , endothelial cell . In addition , umbilical cord blood contains great proportion hematopoietic stem cell bone marrow . In addition , cord blood contains large number immune cell call regulatory T cell , These regulatory T cell may helpful diminish autoimmunity . The need re-establish tolerance patient establish autoimmunity provide another potential mechanism cord blood therapy type 1 diabetes . Description Project : 23 child &gt; 1 year age T1D store umbilical cord blood recruit . The cord blood infused child GCRC attempt regenerate pancreatic islet insulin-producing beta cell improve blood glucose control . As secondary goal , aim track migration transfuse cord blood stem study potential change metabolism/immune function lead islet regeneration . Anticipated Outcome : It hop preservation beta cell function assess mixed meal stimulate C-peptide secretion . Changes immunological markers/function may observe Relevance Type I Diabetes : Type 1 diabetes still associate tremendous morbidity premature mortality . Patients require multiple daily insulin injection throughout life well close monitor diet blood sugar level prevent complication . Unfortunately , presently permanent cure diabetes . Whole pancreas islet cell transplantation available limited number patient necessitate potential lifelong immunosuppressive therapy . The need find cure T1D overstate -autologous stem cell transfusion either potential differentiate islet cell provide immune tolerance lead islet regeneration appear safe potentially viable option .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Must diagnosis T1D store umbilical cord blood AABB and/or FACT accredit cord bank . 2 . TID diagnosis define clear history polydipsia , polyphagia , polyuria , weight loss consistent clinical diagnosis , diagnosis mot base solely upon presence autoantibody . 3 . Cord blood meet selection test criterion ( see ) . 4 . Able complete mixed meal tolerance / glucagon stimulation test . 5 . Normal screen value CBC , Renal function electrolyte ( BMP ) . 6 . Willing comply intensive diabetes management 1 . Complicating medical issue would interfere blood draw monitoring . 2 . Chronic use steroid immunosuppressive agent condition . 3 . Positive infectious disease marker mother ' blood cord time collection ( See detail ) . 4 . Any evidence illness plan infusion date ( i.e . fever &gt; 38.5 C , vomit , diarrhea , wheeze , crackle ) .</criteria>
