	<brief_title>Trial Comparing Morphine Hydromorphone Elderly Patients With Severe Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain cite frequent reason visit emergency department ( EDs ) ( McCaig , 2001 ) . It estimate National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey , annual survey representative sample visit US EDs , 17 million visit per year US EDs specific complaint pain , 29 million visit include “ back symptoms ” “ injury otherwise specify ” well specific mention pain . However widely acknowledge pain seriously under-treated ED well health care setting ( Ducharme , 1996 ; Selbst , 1990 ; Wilson , 1989 ) . The concern regard under-treatment reflected new standard pain management develop Joint Commission Accreditation Healthcare Organizations ( JCAHO ) require assessment pain triage ED refer pain measurement “ fifth vital sign ” ( Philips , 2000 ) . Proper pain management tremendous challenge ED physicians pain noxious experience also symptom injury disease need understood appropriately treat . Further complicate pain management large interpersonal variability pain perception expression reflect cultural , contextual , individual difference people . Reasons under-treating pain include concern side effect opioids , perception pain complaint possible drug-seeking behavior , under-staffing , concern analgesic mask symptom , delay early diagnosis , treatment , contribute risk tolerance dependence vulnerable patient . The elderly represent group patient may experience pain differently non-elderly patient ( Li 2001 , Collins 1966 , Walsh 1989 , Woodrow 1972 ) . This grow population significantly underrepresented pain-related study . Some study show elderly risk “ oligoanalgesia ” receive inadequate dos pain medication ( Jones 1996 ) . Morphine long consider gold standard pain control . Hydromorphone another powerful opiate use extensively management post-operative pain morphine-resistant cancer-related pain . A recent Cochrane review use hydromorphone find 32 study focus acute pain ( Quigley , 2003 ) . Of 32 study , 9 involve intravenous form hydromorphone ( Coda , 1997 ; Collins , 1996 ; Deutsch , 1968 ; Jasani , 1994 ; Liu , 1995 ; Mahler , 1975 ; Rapp , 1996 ; Searle , 1994 ; Urquhart , 1988 ) . Of 8 study , 5 involve patient control analgesia , 1 study compare IV hydromorphone IV morphine ( Mahler , 1975 ) . The Cochrane review conclude gap understand efficacy potency hydromorphone . Only 1 study hydromorphone ED could locate compare IV hydromorphone versus IV meperidine patient ureteral colic ( Jasani , 1994 ) . Although study show hydromorphone superior time period few side effect , study use fix dos hydromorphone ( 1mg ) meperidine ( 50mg ) . It clinical experience ED physicians hydromorphone may better opiate patient present ED acute pain . Hydromorphone also opiate usually give morphine adequately control patient ’ pain ED . Hydromorphone may also benefit , faster onset since lipophilic morphine cross blood-brain barrier faster . If show hydromorphone give good pain relief patient comparable few side effect compare morphine , may able provide evidence suggest hydromorphone parenteral opiate choice adult ED patient present acute pain moderate severe intensity .</detailed_description>
