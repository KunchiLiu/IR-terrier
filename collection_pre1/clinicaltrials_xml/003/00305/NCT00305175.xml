	<detailed_description>Many year study document severe effect sickle cell disease . Some effect include hemolysis ( break red blood cell ) , blockages blood vessel , damage organ system body . Hydroxyurea , give mouth , use effectively prevent blockage blood vessel patient sickle cell disease . The hydroxyurea dosage varies responses body drug well understood . This study follow sickle cell patient treat hydroxyurea long period time evaluate long-term cellular molecular effect drug patient ' body . This study consist two patient group . One group make patient received hydroxyurea therapy enter study ( Old Cohort ) . The second group make patient receive hydroxyurea study entry ( New Cohort ) . This therapeutic drug trial . Subjects study receive hydroxyurea therapy accept clinical indication , treat per best clinical management use treatment algorithm establish St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital pediatric sickle cell program across United States . Hydroxyurea therapy data ( dose duration therapy ) dictate study , collect correlate long-term outcome . Hydroxyurea dose escalation stable MTD occur accord publish guideline .</detailed_description>
