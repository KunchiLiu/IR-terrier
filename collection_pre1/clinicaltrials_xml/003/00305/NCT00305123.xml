	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn sore throat cause germ Group A Streptococcus ( GAS ) `` Strep '' . When `` Strep '' cause sore throat , treat medicine call antibiotic . However , treat , lead heart problem serious disease . This study identify different type `` Strep '' present child sore throat . Researchers check child sore throat least twice weekly among group approximately 12,000 child . Study participant include child , age 5-16 , attend public elementary school Djikoroni-Sébénikoro , low income community Bamako , Mali . Throat swab obtain free treatment available child enrol group complains sore throat . The information study may help make vaccine prevent `` Strep '' infection Malian child . Children may participate 3 year duration study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Data epidemiology group A streptococci ( GAS ) infection develop country limit . Available publication suggest disease prevalent , severe manifestation continue occur high rate . Several promise GAS vaccine candidate pre-clinical clinical development . One approach enter clinical trial use multivalent recombinant fusion peptide vaccine contain amino-terminal M protein fragment . In animal model , M-protein type-specific epitope induce protective opsonic antibody cross-react human tissue . If type-specific vaccine use develop country , molecular epidemiology GAS setting must better characterize . The primary objective study identify genotype ( emm type sub-type ) GAS isolate 5 16 year old schoolchildren pharyngitis live poor urban community Bamako , Mali . The secondary objective : characterize molecular epidemiology GAS pharyngitis among Malian schoolchildren determine distribution genotype accord age year , year study , season ( cold dry ) ; estimate incidence GAS pharyngitis among 5 16 year old schoolchildren live poor urban community Bamako , Mali overall age , gender , year study , season ; describe clinical feature GAS pharyngitis among Malian schoolchildren . Surveillance pharyngitis conduct least twice weekly among cohort approximately 12,000 child , age 5-16 , attend four public elementary school Djikoroni-para-Sébénikoro , low-income community Bamako , Mali . Throat swab obtain child enrol cohort complains sore throat . GAS isolate swabs characterized emm typing . The primary endpoint study proportion emm-type among child GAS pharyngitis . The secondary endpoint include follow : proportion emm-type among child GAS pharyngitis overall accord age year , year study , season ( cold dry ) ; proportion child pharyngitis GAS isolate ; minimal incidence GAS pharyngitis per 100,000 child catchment area Djikoroni-para-Sébénikoro overall accord : age year , gender , year study , season ( cold dry ) ; incidence density ( number case per children-weeks follow ) GAS pharyngitis among enrolled school child overall accord : age year , year study , season ( cold dry ) ; proportion child GAS pharyngitis experience symptom fever , exudative pharyngitis , tender cervical adenopathy , scarletiniform rash , overall age year . It clear GAS important worldwide pathogen understudy much developing world . Given early success multivalent M type-specific vaccine , investigation molecular epidemiology delineate distribution emm-types organism associate pharyngitis ( therefore presumably acute rheumatic fever ) crucial design vaccine utility prevent rheumatic heart disease GAS disease develop world . The current protocol intend provide data address goal .</detailed_description>
