	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vaccines make gene-modified tumor cell may help body build immune response kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Cetuximab may also stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving vaccine therapy together cyclophosphamide cetuximab may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well vaccine therapy work give together cyclophosphamide cetuximab treat patient metastatic locally advanced pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine safety pancreatic tumor vaccine , cyclophosphamide , cetuximab patient metastatic locally advanced adenocarcinoma pancreas . Secondary - Determine overall , progression-free , event-free survival patient treat regimen . - Correlate specific vivo parameter immune response ( e.g. , mesothelin , prostate stem cell antigen [ PSCA ] , mutate k-ras-specific T-cell response ) clinical response patient treat regimen . - Correlate downstream target epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) signal ( e.g. , intratumor expression Akt , Stat 3 5 , mesothelin , mutate k-ras , PSCA ) inhibition cetuximab patient treat regimen . - Correlate inhibition EGFR signaling ( e.g. , Stat 3 5 ) improve specific mesothelin , PSCA , mutate k-ras-specific T-cell response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV day 0 , sargramostim plasmid DNA pancreatic tumor vaccine intradermally day 1 , cetuximab IV 1-2 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood collection tumor biopsy periodically study biomarker correlative study . At completion study treatment , patient follow 3 week every 4 week 16 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 60 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
