	<brief_summary>Unilateral spatial neglect ( USN ) believe disorder attention , characterize impairment ability perceive respond stimulus present contralesional space , attributable significant sensory motor deficit . USN serious consequence rehabilitation long term disability . Efforts make clarify theoretical basis phenomenon rehabilitation method best improve function . The purpose study try contribute effort examine treatment effectiveness two method ; one target general arousal ( phasic alerting ) , target increase awareness leave side stimuli habit change . Functional neuroimaging method ( PET [ positron emission tomography ] fMRI [ functional magnetic resonance image ] ) apply understand functional anatomy brain mental process . Only attempt make use functional neuroimaging patient neurological deficit USN , usually speculation make base finding healthy participant explain disorder . This study 's aim examine functional reorganization attentional network brain USN patient perform visual task , mean functional neuroimaging technique , light specific rehabilitation technique . Patients examine 3 week rehabilitation use standardized neurobehavioral test PET imaging procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Rehabilitation Recovery Patients Post Right Stroke With Unilateral Spatial Neglect</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Procedure : Inclusion criterion : - first time right hemispheric stroke ( ischemic ) ; - 2-6 week post stroke incident ; - age 25-85 ; - right hand dominance ; - minimum education 6 year ; - suffer field cut deficit hemi-anopsia ; - without know neurological disorder ( e.g. , Parkinson 's disease , aphasia ) ; - without severe systemic condition ( e.g. , malignancy , AIDS , congestive heart failure , substance abuse ) ; - take additional medication could affect central nervous system ; without dementia ; - without mental illness ; - patient legal guardian give inform consent . Participants : - six patient recruit randomly allocate one treatment group ( phasic alert standard visual spatial training treatment provide OT department ) . Patients undergo thorough evaluation neglect undergo PET procedure transfer rehabilitation . Patient receive intensive rehabilitation 15 session cognitive treatment 15 session motor training . After period patient undergo another PET procedure ass change brain activation . Patient return rehabilitation need .</detailed_description>
