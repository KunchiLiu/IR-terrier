	<brief_title>Safety Hydromorphone Adult Patients Presenting Emergency Department With Acute Severe Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Background : Pain cite frequent reason visit emergency department ( EDs ) ( McCaig , 2001 ) . It estimate National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey , annual survey representative sample visit US EDs , 17 million visit per year US EDs specific complaint pain , 29 million visit include `` back symptom '' `` injury otherwise specify '' well specific mention pain . However widely acknowledge pain seriously under-treated ED well health care setting ( Ducharme , 1996 ; Selbst , 1990 ; Wilson , 1989 ) . The concern regard under-treatment reflected new standard pain management develop Joint Commission Accreditation Healthcare Organizations ( JCAHO ) require assessment pain triage ED refer pain measurement `` fifth vital sign '' ( Philips , 2000 ) . Proper pain management tremendous challenge ED physicians pain noxious experience also symptom injury disease need understood appropriately treat . Further complicate pain management large interpersonal variability pain perception expression reflect cultural , contextual , individual difference people . Reasons under-treating pain include concern side effect opioids , perception pain complaint possible drug-seeking behavior , under-staffing , concern analgesic mask symptom delay early diagnosis treatment , contribute risk tolerance dependence vulnerable patient . Morphine long consider gold standard pain control . Hydromorphone another powerful opioid use extensively management post-operative pain morphine-resistant cancer-related pain . A recent Cochrane review use hydromorphone find 32 study focus acute pain ( Quigley , 2003 ) . Of 32 study , 9 involve intravenous form hydromorphone ( Coda , 1997 ; Collins , 1996 ; Deutsch , 1968 ; Jasani , 1994 ; Liu , 1995 ; Mahler , 1975 ; Rapp , 1996 ; Searle , 1994 ; Urquhart , 1988 ) . Of 8 study , 5 involve patient control analgesia , 1 study compare IV hydromorphone IV morphine ( Mahler , 1975 ) . The Cochrane review conclude substantial gap understand efficacy potency hydromorphone . We recently complete study non-elderly adult patient ( IRB 04-08-225 ) show weight-based IV hydromorphone provide well pain relief weight-based IV morphine . This result statistically clinically significant . We also demonstrate study IV hydromorphone faster onset also provide statistically significant improvement pain relief 5 minute compare IV morphine . Although weight-based dosing medication common pediatrics , emergency physician use whole integer amount pain medication . IV hydromorphone potent IV morphine , dosages give much small . We therefore wish give standard 2 mg dose IV hydromorphone non-elderly adult patient weigh least 150 lbs present ED acute severe pain . We wish examine safety speed onset hydromorphone use protocol . Our general think develop evidence base practice , need generate practice base evidence . This study attempt practice base practical . We wish take drug come ( 2mg Dilaudid ampule ) use , thus alleviate need waste excess opioid ( alleviate need find second person witness waste ) . We also wish use weight cutoff everyone remember ( 150 lb ) . We believe protocol provide great pain relief help address issue inadequate pain treatment , `` oligoanalgesia '' , prominent literature ( Sobel 2002 , Wilson , 1989 , Goldfrank 2000 ) . Finally , multiple study pain conducted ED , find relatively high rate refusal receive pain medication . We think may represent component problem oligoanalgesia widespread ED . We wish investigate reason patient refusal receive parental opioid medication ( fear addiction , side effect , etc ) .</detailed_description>
