	<brief_title>Evolution Pain From Herpes Zoster</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pain , nerve trunk inflammation , neuronal injury hallmark acute herpes zoster ( AHZ ) . We hypothesize development post-herpetic neuralgia ( PHN ) strongly depend two factor : 1 ) severity initial neural injury 2 ) ability recover initial neural injury . To test hypothesis , prospectively follow 150 patient high risk development PHN . Evolution pain neural injury evaluate 2-6 week , 6 week , 3 month , 6 month 2 year longer onset AHZ multiple measure . Assessments 2 year longer compare collect first 6 month HZ order test whether sensory function cutaneous innervation continue normalize beyond 6 month subject recover HZ without severe PHN . Preliminary analysis study data show reduced innervation HZ skin , mirror image skin distant control skin acute phase HZ specific persistence pain 3 month . The innervation appear recover fully 6 month distant control skin mirror-image skin HZ skin , despite fact subject continue experience reduction zoster-associated pain . This suggest symptom pain sensory dysfunction due mere loss overall innervation density . The propose subsequent â‰¥ 2 year study visit analysis allow u directly correlate pain resolution resolution sensory innervation abnormality .</detailed_description>
