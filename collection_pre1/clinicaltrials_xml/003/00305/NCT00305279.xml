	<detailed_description>Chronic kidney disease affect 11 % US population ; half affect skeletal manifestation renal disease . Renal osteodystrophy complex disease , multiple mineral system relate hormone play role , include phosphate homeostasis . Phosphate regulation primarily depend renal handle phosphate , partly control parathyroid hormone vitamin D. However , mediator system clearly exist . Recently , evidence accrue one factor may FGF23 , protein produce osteogenic cell . States excess FGF23 associate marked phosphate wasting , hypophosphatemia , osteomalacia , inappropriately low calcitriol . FGF23 level measurable healthy human markedly elevate patient require hemodialysis , although physiologic role either state unknown . Some retrospective evidence suggest FGF23 affect phosphate intake . We perform study gather data describe response FGF23 change dietary phosphorus intake healthy men woman men woman moderate renal insufficiency . The specific aim pilot study : 1 ) To examine physiologic effect alteration dietary phosphorus FGF23 healthy subject ; 2 ) To examine physiologic response FGF23 dietary phosphorus alteration patient moderate renal failure ; 3 ) To assess whether serum level 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D vary inversely FGF23 dietary phosphate change . The propose research plan dietary intervention trial study response serum FGF23 level diet vary phosphorus content healthy adult adult moderate renal insufficiency .</detailed_description>
