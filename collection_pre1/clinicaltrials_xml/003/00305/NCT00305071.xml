	<brief_title>Effect Adjuvant Treatment With Compound Cranberry Extract Tablets Acute Bacterial Cystitis .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Acute bacterial cystitis common bothersome disease rapid onset nature . Uncomplicated cystitis occur patient without anatomical physiological anomaly lower urinary tract . Although infection life threaten immuno-competent patient , associate low urinary tract symptom cause massive impact quality-of-life victim . The voiding symptom , urinary frequency , urgency , dysuria suprapubic pain , associate inflammatory response microbial invasion . In clinical scenario , 3-day empirical oral antimicrobial treatment could eradicate pathogen efficiently.1,2 However , low urinary tract symptom eradicate effectively antibiotic . In daily clinical practice , several symptomatic relieving treatment apply acute infection present , include pyridine anticholinergic agent . However , several side effect complain accord medication . In low urinary tract infection , virulence pathogen major factor associate colonization invasion urinary tract mucosa . The adherence pathogen urothelium crucial step urinary tract infection.3 Several study reveal good anti-adherence effect cranberry juice.4-7 In several clinical study , cranberry juice proven protective effect bacterial cystitis8 role cranberry juice prevent urinary tract infection well established.9,10 Cranberry rich source bioactive compound , phenolic acid several organic acid , proven play major anti-bacterial effect.11 In literature reviewing , clinical application cranberry juice extract tablet focus preventive role chronic repeat urinary tract infection . The effect reduce bacteriuria pyuria mentioned.12 However , effect lower urinary tract symptom relieve effect food supplement cranberry establish . In study , try evaluate clinical efficacy commercial compound cranberry extract treat acute uncomplicated cystitis adjunctive role . The compound tablet contain 900mg per tablet , include 600 % concentrated cranberry extract 150mg , vitamin C 70mg , Rhizoma extract ( Acrobio TS® ) 150mg , Flos extract ( Acrobio GL® ) 60mg , lactose mannitol 490mg . The compound market Taiwan food supplement well tolerable . We conduct double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled trial evaluate adjuvant effect compound cranberry extract symptomatic relieving effect . Material Methods Study Method : We prepare conduct paralleled-group , double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomized clinical trial evaluate effect compound cranberry extract tablet adjunctive modality treat acute uncomplicated bacterial cystitis otherwise healthy female patient . The treatment arm receive standard 3-day oral antibiotic plus 7-day compound cranberry extract tablet ( UmayC ) control arm receive standard 3-day oral antibiotic plus 7-day identical placebo . Study Processes : 1 . Participant recruitment During study period , recruit 60 volunteer female patient visit urological outpatient clinic Min-Sheng General Hospital uncomplicated acute bacterial cystitis join trial . The age limitation 20 65 year old acute cystitis diagnose clinical symptom , physical exam pyuria ( WBC &gt; 5/HPF ) urinalysis . The exclusion criterion : recent ( less one month ) urinary tract infection partially treat acute cystitis ; anatomical function disease low urinary tract ; patient receive radical pelvic surgery ; associate bladder stone disease ; upper urinary tract anomaly urolithiasis ; systemic infection body temperature high 38°C ; know allergic reaction cranberry vitamin C ; pregnant prepare pregnant , diabetic patient . 2 . Objectives outcome measurement We try evaluate symptom relieve effect compound cranberry extract adjuvant therapeutic modality . The study hypothesis compound cranberry extract tablet adjuvant treatment uncomplicated acute bacterial cystitis 3-day empirical antibiotic reduce irritative bladder symptom ( urinary frequency , urinary urgency , dysuria suprapubic pain ) . We conduct Frequency-Urgency-Pain ( FUP ) score evaluate irritative low urinary tract symptom . Another 10-point Likert scale 0 ( none ) 9 ( severe ) questionnaire use evaluate every individual symptom . A modified diary method use evaluate symptom change whole evaluation period . 3 in-face questionnaire interview preform day 1 , 4 , 8 study assistant . A brief form questionnaire do telephone day 2 3 . The primary outcome study proportion symptom relief ( base FUP individual symptom scale evaluation ) 3-day 7-day treatment . The secondary outcome variable pyuria eradication rate 3- 7-day therapy time symptoms relief . Possible adverse effect record report . 3 . Sample size randomization In study , recruit 60 participant detect difference intervention control group 0.05 one-sided significance level 80 % power . These participant randomly assign group accord pre-set random permute block procedure . Efficacy analysis conduct accord intension-to-treat principle . 4 . Intervention Intervention group receive 3-day oral trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole ( 80/400mg ) 2 tablet twice day day 1 3 plus oral compound cranberry extract tablet ( UmayC , 900mg ) 2 tablet three time day day 1 7 . The control group receive oral antibiotic plus identical placebo prescribe protocol intervention arm . For patient know allergic reaction sulfa drug , empirical antibiotic replace cephalexin ( 250mg ) 2 capsule four time day . Study Processes : After participant enrollment inform consent , detail medical history collect , include basic physiological data ( body weight height ) , major medical disease ( diabetes , cerebral vascular disease , neurological disorder ) , major operation history ( neurological pelvic surgery ) , recent medication record ( include recent antibiotic treatment ) , child-baring history , sexual activity , fluid drinking history , socio-economical education status . A voiding symptoms questionnaire , include FUP score 10-point Likert scale symptomatic question , do in-face interview study assistant . Random urine bacterial culture collect medical treatment . The participant request receive 2 telephone interview day 2 3 study assistant return urinalysis 2nd in-face questionnaire day 4 complete antibiotic treatment . The clinical follow arrange day 8 physician urinalysis do . Adverse event report patient safety All participant receive close follow protocol adverse event reporting . Any discomfort associate medical treatment record daily interview record report . Interruption trial intervention decode perform immediately intolerable side effect happen .</detailed_description>
