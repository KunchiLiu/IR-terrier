	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis chronic , degenerative joint disorder cure . While OA occur almost joint , commonly occur knee . Obesity significant risk factor development knee OA associate faster disease progression . Biomechanical inflammation cognitive behavioral change relate obesity exacerbate OA pain disability . The purpose study develop effective way treat individual knee OA . Specifically , study compare effectiveness lifestyle behavioral weight management program , pain-coping skill training , standard care improve OA symptom day-to-day function obese individual OA one knee . The study treatment group meet total 6 month . Participants randomly assign one four condition : 1 ) lifestyle behavioral weight management program , 2 ) pain-coping skill training , 3 ) lifestyle behavioral weight management program plus pain-coping skill training , 4 ) standard care . The lifestyle behavioral weight management program focus lifestyle , exercise , attitude , relationship , nutrition .

Participants first three condition attend 12 weekly group session , follow 6 every-other-week group session . After complete treatment , participant receive monthly follow-up telephone call facilitate post-treatment transition . There total four evaluation study : immediately prior treatment , immediately treatment , 6 12 month follow end treatment . During evaluation , blood urine collect analyze disease biomarkers . An exercise treadmill test height , weight , body mass index measure use ass aerobic fitness . Lower extremity function measure `` Up Go '' performance test . Participants also videotape walk evaluate gait ask fill series questionnaire . Medication use review interview . During first evaluation , x-rays take measure disease activity . Participants complete study intervention four follow-up evaluation eligible join second part study examine relationship food intake , mood , activity level , pain . Participants complete series questionnaire baseline 2-day diary rate mood , pain , activity level record food intake trigger random time throughout day .
