	<brief_summary>Recurrent urinary tract infection ( RUTIS ) continue major health problem woman complicate increase antibiotic resistance . New preventive approach need . Because woman RUTI lack normal protective Lactobacillus ( LB ) vaginal flora , hypothesize restoration LB would reduce RUTIS . In trail , woman recent UTI randomize receive either LB placebo vaginal capsule follow side effect , colonization LB occurrence RUTI hte next four month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravaginal LACTIN-V Prevention Recurrent Urinary Tract Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose : The purpose study evaluate safety vaginal suppository LACTIN-V ( Lactobacillus crispatus CTV-05 ) well efficacy LACTIN-V use prevent recurrent urinary tract infection ( RUTI ) woman . Study subject include pre-menopausal woman history frequent RUTI . As part study , also evaluate growth lactobacilli urinary tract infection ( UTI ) -causing bacteria vaginas woman follow use LACTIN-V . Rationale : LACTIN-V composed L. crispatus . L. crispatus bacteria find grow naturally vaginas healthy woman . It felt important prevent vaginal infection UTI . With regard prevention UTI , L. crispatus think prevent growth UTI-causing bacteria ( E. coli ) vagina , prevent UTI-causing bacteria able enter female urethra cause infection bladder ( cystitis ) . There epidemiologic evidence support prevention mechanism , absence L. crispatus relate lactobacilli vagina associate vaginal E. coli growth UTI . Scientific evidence support ability lactobacilli prevent vaginal E. coli growth out-competing E. coli vaginal colonization , production toxin lactic acid , hydrogen peroxide , bacteriocins . LACTIN-V contains specific strain L. crispatus , CTV-05 , isolated vagina healthy woman . It prepare vaginal suppository purpose restore growth healthy L. crispatus vagina woman experience frequent RUTI . As indicated , woman often deficiency healthy vaginal lactobacillus growth , therefore may experience protective function natural organism . It hop use LACTIN-V lead vaginal growth protective lactobacilli woman wich , turn , prevent vaginal growth E. coli UTI-causing bacteria . Phase 1 2 study LACTIN-V date show `` probiotic '' safe well tolerate . The impetus study urgent need non-antibiotic strategy prevent UTI . UTI one common bacterial infection . It lead substantial morbidity health care cost . Frequent use antibiotic treatment prophylaxis UTI contribute prevalence antibiotic resistant bacteria , also make difficult treat UTI . Therefore , potential advantage LACTIN-V natural product may prevent UTI without use antibiotic . If prof efficacious , could decrease morbidity health care cost associate UTI well decrease overall antibiotic use correspond prevalence antibiotic resistance among UTI-causing bacteria . Primary Objective : The primary objective evaluate safety LACTIN-V , compare placebo , pre-menopausal woman recurrent uncomplicated UTI . Secondary objective : 1 . To evaluate efficacy LACTIN-V , compare placebo , reduce incidence Symptomatic Probable UTI ( define ) . 2 . To evaluate efficacy LACTIN-V , compare placebo , decrease time recurrence Symptomatic Probable UTI . 3 . To evaluate efficacy LACTIN-V , compare placebo , reduce prevalence Asymptomatic UTI ( define ) . 4 . To evaluate vaginal growth CTV-05 subject use LACTIN-V compare placebo . 5 . To evaluate vaginal growth lactobacilli subject use LACTIN-V compare subject use placebo . 6 . To evaluate vaginal growth E. coli subject use LACTIN-V compare subject use placebo . Case Definitions : Symptomatic UTI : One UTI symptom ( dysuria , urgency , frequency , suprapubic pain , flank pain ) , positive urine culture . In symptomatic subject , positive urine culture define &gt; = 10^2/ml UTI-causing bacteria . UTI episodes record Symptomatic UTI negative urine culture Visit 2 , another interim study visit , confirm resolution prior UTI ( order distinguish new Symptomatic UTI Persistent UTI ) . Asymptomatic UTI : A positive urine culture subject report urinary symptom . In asymptomatic subject , positive urine culture define &gt; = 10^5/ml UTI-causing bacteria . UTI episodes record Asymptomatic UTI negative urine culture Visit 2 , another interim study visit , confirm resolution prior UTI ( order distinguish new Asymptomatic UTI Persistent UTI ) . Probable UTI : One UTI symptom ( dysuria , urgency , frequency , suprapubic pain , flank pain ) subject contact healthcare provider treat antibiotic UTI without confirmatory urine culture . UTI episodes record Probable UTI negative urine culture Visit 2 , another interim study visit , confirm resolution prior UTI ( order distinguish new Probable UTI Persistent UTI ) . Persistent UTI : A positive urine culture follow antibiotic treatment UTI . General Procedures : This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial LACTIN-V . Subjects include 100 pre-menopausal woman history frequent RUTI currently recently treat symptomatic UTI trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole . Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole one several antibiotic consider standard-of-care treatment symptomatic UTI . Subjects randomize 50 woman receive LACTIN-V dose 5x10^8 CFU/suppository 50 woman receive placebo . LACTIN-V placebo take per day five day first week use follow per week 10 week Days 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 , 43 , 50 , 57 , 64 , 71 total 15 dos 11 week . Subjects undergo five schedule visit receive two telephone call : Visit 1 Screening Visit . This visit take place soon evaluation symptomatic UTI . The following occur Visit 1 : informed consent , review eligibility , history , physical exam , pelvic exam , Pap smear , urine pregnancy test , screen test gonorrhea , chlamydia , bacterial vaginosis , yeast , trichomonas . Subjects provide urine sample microscopic analysis , dipstick analysis , culture , antibiotic susceptibility test vaginal fluid specimens laboratory assessment vaginal growth lactobacillus ( include CTV-05 ) . Visit 2 Randomization Visit represent Week 1 study . Visit 2 take place 3-10 day completion antibiotic therapy UTI . Subjects eligibility confirm undergo focused pelvic exam without speculum bimanual exam unless clinically indicate , screen test bacterial vaginosis , yeast , trichomonas , repeat pregnancy test . Subjects also provide urine vaginal fluid specimen Visit 1 . Subjects randomize LACTIN-V placebo . Subjects place first suppository supervision instruct use 7-day study calendar record study product use related symptom first week , use 10-week study calendar record study product use relate symptom thereafter . Day 4-7 phone call : The purpose phone call ass use study product well associate symptom . Visit 3 occur Week 2 , day 8-14 follow randomization . Subjects ask study product use , adverse event , symptom . Subjects undergo focused physical pelvic exam without speculum bimanual exam unless clinically indicate . Subjects screen test bacterial vaginosis provide urine vaginal fluid specimen . Visit 4 occur Week 11 similar Visit 3 . Visit 5 occur Week 16 . The procedure Visit 5 similar Visits 3 4 . However , visit , subject undergo complete pelvic exam include speculum bimanual exam undergo repeat pregnancy test . 9 Month telephone call : The purpose phone call ass occurrence adverse event , symptom UTI , new UTI medical diagnosis , pregnancy . In addition schedule visit , subject ask come research clinic Unscheduled Visits experience adverse event new symptom UTI . During unscheduled visit , subject undergo history , physical complete pelvic exam , screen test bacterial vaginosis , yeast , trichomonas , well sexually transmit disease clinically indicate . Subjects provide urine sample microscopic analysis , dipstick analysis , culture , antibiotic susceptibility test . Subjects provide vaginal fluid sample assessment CTV-05 , lactobacillus , E. coli growth . Subjects diagnose Symptomatic UTI study treat antibiotic . They ask return study clinic follow-up urine culture two week later confirm UTI resolution . Laboratory procedure include : - wet mount slide vaginal fluid ( Visits ) - urine dipstick testing ( Visits ) - urine pregnancy test ( Visits 1 , 2 , 5 ) - Pap smear ( Visit 1 ) - Testing gonorrhea chlamydia culture ( Visit 1 , visit indicate ) - urinalysis ( Visits ) - urine culture ( Visits ) - gram stain culture vaginal fluid specimen ( All Visits ) - Rep-PCR CTV-05 ( Visits 2-5 ) - DNA amplification vaginal flora ( Visits ) Statistical Analysis : The primary cohort analysis intent-to-treat ( ITT ) cohort . The ITT cohort define subject randomize study . Other cohort evaluate include modify ITT , Evaluable , according-to-protocol cohort .</detailed_description>
