	<brief_summary>This study investigate safety effectiveness preventative vaccine parvovirus B-19 infection . Eighty-nine healthy adult age 18-49 , whose blood test negative B-19 , enrol . Participants randomly choose receive 1 4 possible vaccine type : low dose vaccine adjuvant ( substance assist transfer medication body ) ; high dose vaccine alone ; high dose vaccine adjuvant ; saline ( substance contain medication ) . Participants receive 3 vaccination 6 month period follow 6 additional month . Blood sample take month 1 , 2 , 6 , 7 12 determine antibody , protein produce body 's immune system recognize help fight infection , form vaccine . These test measure vaccine efficacy , i.e. , determine vaccine induces immunity . All participant follow closely safety throughout study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study Phase I/II randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind clinical trial immunogenicity safety 2 dose level recombinant human parvovirus B-19 vaccine ( VAI-VP705 ) . The vaccine compose viral capsid incorporate 2 B-19 protein ( VP-1 VP-2 ) . There 3 site participate study : Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center , Baylor College Medicine , University Maryland School Medicine . Eighty-nine parvovirus B-19 seronegative healthy adult 18-45 year old randomize 1 4 group : 2.5 mcg VAI-VP705 adjuvant MF59 , 25 mcg adjuvant MF59 , 25 mcg without adjuvant MF59 , placebo ( saline control ) . Each participant receive 3 separate vaccination ( Months 0 , 1 , 6 ) continue study approximately 14 month . Study participant follow evaluate safety immune response . The primary study objective evaluate safety VAI-VP705 administer without MF59 adjuvant healthy parvovirus B-19 seronegative adult . The secondary study objective : evaluate immunogenicity primary booster immunization 25 mcg VAI VP705 without MF59 2.5 mcg MF59 ; compare antibody response vaccine administer MF59 2 dos , 2.5 25 mcg versus 25 mcg vaccine administer without MF59 ; evaluate duration immune response 12 month primary immunization . The primary endpoint number percentage study participant experience vaccine-associated adverse event serious adverse event . The secondary endpoint include : percentage study participant develop neutralize antibody response parvovirus B-19 28 day follow last dose vaccine ; percentage study participant maintain neutralize antibody titer 12 month primary immunization ; geometric mean antibody titer ( measure enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ) treatment group 28 day 12 month primary immunization ; geometric mean neutralize titer per treatment group 28 day 12 month primary immunization .</detailed_description>
