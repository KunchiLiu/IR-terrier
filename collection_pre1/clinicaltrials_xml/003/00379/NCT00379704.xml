	<brief_summary>Tissue factor main activator coagulation cascade . Excessive tissue factor expression make responsible thrombosis number clinical situation include thrombosis contact atherosclerotic plaque . Recent work show tissue factor gene expression adipose tissue significantly increase obese versus lean mouse . The main objective study show tissue factor expression increase human adipose tissue obtain obese subject identify main tissular origin compare abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue . The secondary objective identify cell origin tissue factor ( adipocytes versus stromal cell ) analyze relation ship blood tissue factor ( ) tissue factor express adipose tissue , ( ii ) amount subcutaneous profound adipose tissue , ( iii ) coagulation activation marker .</brief_summary>
