	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Naltrexone may fight breast cancer block use estrogen tumor cell . Naltrexone may also stop growth breast cancer impair blood flow tumor . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well naltrexone work treat woman metastatic breast cancer longer responsive previous hormone therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Naltrexone Treating Women With Metastatic Breast Cancer That Did Not Respond Hormone Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine efficacy naltrexone woman hormone-refractory , metastatic breast cancer measure serial fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography-CT scan . Secondary - Determine safety naltrexone patient . - Determine median time event ( first time maximum specific uptake value higher baseline ) within 1 year study entry . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive oral naltrexone daily 8 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After 8 week , patient may continue naltrexone study discretion physician . Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography-CT scan baseline , week 4 , week 8 , periodically thereafter . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 35 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
