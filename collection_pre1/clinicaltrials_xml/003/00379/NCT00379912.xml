	<brief_title>Azacitidine Erythropoietin Versus Azacitidine Alone Patients With Low-Risk Myelodysplastic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This open label , multi-center , randomize study . Eligible patient randomize one two treatment arm : Arm A ( Azacitidine + Erythropoietin ) - Azacitidine Treatment 50 mg/m2 subcutaneously every day ( three time week ) two consecutive week every four week . A cycle therapy define two consecutive week subcutaneous azacitidine administer every day three time week ( e.g . Monday - Wednesday - Friday ) time resolution treatment associate toxicity . - Erythropoietin Treatment Patients randomize Arm A receive dose 60,000IU single subcutaneous injection weekly without interruption enrol protocol therapy . The dose administer coincide first day cycle . - Protocol therapy may administer six cycle therapy . Arm B ( Azacitidine Alone ) - Azacitidine Treatment 50 mg/m2 subcutaneously every day ( three time week ) two consecutive week every four week . A cycle therapy define two consecutive week subcutaneous azacitidine administer every day three time week ( e.g . Monday - Wednesday - Friday ) time resolution treatment associate toxicity . - Protocol therapy may administer six cycle therapy . ECOG performance status 0 2 Hematopoietic : To eligible randomization , subject must documentation least 1 follow : - A transfusion dependent anemia ( defined history two episode transfusion within period 8 week ) . - An untransfused hemoglobin &lt; 10 gm/dl measure least two occasion 7 day apart month prior randomization . Patients must also meet 1 follow criterion : - Has receive prior erythropoietin serum erythropoietin level &gt; 200 IU/L within 14 day randomization . - Has receive prior erythropoietin without clinical benefit judgment treat physician . - Adequate iron status define serum ferritin &gt; 20 ng/ml transferrin saturation &gt; 30 % within 90 day prior randomization . - Symptoms attribute anemia hemoglobin &lt; 11 g/dL . - Folate Vitamin B12 level within normal limit within 90 day prior randomization . Hepatic : - SGOT ( ALT ) level &lt; 2 x ULN within 14 day prior randomization . - SGPT ( AST ) level &lt; 2 x ULN within 14 day prior randomization . - Serum total bilirubin level &lt; 2 x ULN within 14 day prior randomization . Renal : - Serum creatine &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) within 14 day prior randomization . Cardiovascular : - No uncontrolled hypertension ( define systolic pressure &gt; 160 mmHg and/or diastolic pressure &gt; 110 mmHg ) . - No history ( within 12 month ) deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) , pulmonary embolism ( PE ) , venous thrombosis . Prior superficial thrombophlebitis exclusion criterion . - No history ( within 6 month ) cerebrovascular accident ( [ CVA ] include ischemic , embolic , hemorrhagic ) , transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) , myocardial ischemia ( include Unstable Angina , Q wave Myocardial Infarction [ QwMI ] , non-Q wave Myocardial Infarction [ NQMI ] ) , arterial thrombosis .</detailed_description>
