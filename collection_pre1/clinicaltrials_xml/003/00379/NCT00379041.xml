	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill cancer cell . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving radiation therapy together combination chemotherapy may kill cancer cell . It yet know whether radiation therapy effective without combination chemotherapy treat patient Hodgkin 's lymphoma . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study radiation therapy see well work without combination chemotherapy treat patient previously untreated stage I stage II Hodgkin 's lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy With Without Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Stage I Stage II Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Evaluate efficacy mantle field radiotherapy , term overall survival , patient previously untreated stage I II Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( HL ) favorable prognosis . - Compare late treatment-related toxicity patient stage I II HL favorable prognosis treat standard subtotal nodal radiotherapy v combination 3 course mechlorethamine , vincristine , procarbazine hydrochloride , prednisone/doxorubicin hydrochloride , bleomycin , vinblastine ( MOPP/ABV ) follow involved field radiotherapy . - Compare overall survival late treatment-related toxicity patient stage I II HL unfavorable prognosis treat 6 course MOPP/ABV follow involved field radiotherapy vs 4 course MOPP/ABV follow involved field radiotherapy vs subtotal nodal radiotherapy . - Maintain failure-free survival rate reach previous study , reduction acute side effect treatment , particularly severe late toxicity . OUTLINE : This randomize , control , prospective , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prognosis ( favorable v unfavorable v favorable ) . - Stratum 1 ( favorable prognosis ) : Patients undergo mantle field radiotherapy 5 day week least 4 week . - Stratum 2 ( favorable prognosis ) : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients undergo subtotal nodal radiotherapy 5 day week least 4 week . - Arm II : Patients receive mechlorethamine IV vincristine IV day 1 ; oral procarbazine hydrochloride day 1-7 ; oral prednisone day 1-14 ; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV , bleomycin intramuscularly ( IM ) IV , vinblastine IV day 8 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning 3-4 week completion chemotherapy , patient undergo involved field radiotherapy 5 day week least 4 week . - Stratum 3 ( unfavorable prognosis ) : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive mechlorethamine IV vincristine IV day 1 ; oral procarbazine hydrochloride day 1-7 ; oral prednisone day 1-14 ; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV , bleomycin IM IV , vinblastine IV day 8 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning 3-4 week completion chemotherapy , patient undergo involved field radiotherapy 5 day week least 4 week . - Arm II : Patients receive chemotherapy arm I . Treatment repeat every 4 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo involved field radiotherapy arm I . - Arm III : Patients receive chemotherapy arm I . Treatment repeat every 4 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning 3-4 week completion chemotherapy , patient undergo subtotal nodal radiotherapy 5 day week least 4 week . Quality life assess completion study treatment annually 10 year . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2 , 4 , 6 , 9 , 12 month , every 4 month 1 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 1,158 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
