	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Lapatinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving lapatinib together radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose lapatinib give together radiation therapy treat patient locally recurrent chemotherapy-refractory locally advanced metastatic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lapatinib Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Locally Recurrent Chemotherapy-Refractory Locally Advanced Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine toxicity lapatinib ditosylate radiotherapy patient locally recurrent breast cancer chemotherapy-refractory , locally advanced metastatic breast cancer . - Determine impact drug inhibition receptor downstream signal transduction pathway activation tumor tissue , context inhibitor dose escalation without radiotherapy . Secondary - Determine , preliminarily , efficacy lapatinib ditosylate radiotherapy patient . - Correlate response patient inhibition downstream signal . - Assess gene expression change tumor biopsy sample patient treat lapatinib ditosylate alone combination radiotherapy . OUTLINE : This multicenter , parallel group , dose-escalation study lapatinib ditosylate . Patients stratify accord prior radiotherapy ( yes v ) . - Group I ( prior radiotherapy ) : Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate daily absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Beginning day 8 lapatinib ditosylate therapy , patient undergo concurrent radiotherapy 5 day week 5 week . - Group II ( prior radiotherapy ) : Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate group I . Beginning day 8 , patient undergo concurrent radiotherapy 5 day week 7 week . In group , cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos lapatinib ditosylate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity first course . Patients undergo skin punch core biopsy baseline* day 8 day 15 . Tumor biopsy sample examine IHC evaluation EGFR , phospho-EGFR , HER2 , phospho-HER2 , phospho-Akt , phospho-MAPK . Samples also examine cell proliferation Ki-67 , apoptosis TUNEL , angiogenesis microvessel density . Additionally , mRNA extract fresh frozen sample examine microarray analysis . NOTE : *Archival tissue acceptable baseline sample , available</detailed_description>
