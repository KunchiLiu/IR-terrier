	<detailed_description>Study design We propose conduct randomize control study infant recruit Maternal Child Health center town Koforidua , locate eastern Ghana . There 8 center locate various part town , serve mother child immediate vicinity . The vast majority infant bear Koforidua bring MCH center begin week birth monthly weight monitoring . A list infant attend MCH center approximately 5 mo age , congenital abnormality chronic disease , currently breastfed create clinic day . From list randomly select approximately 34 infant per month ( recruitment period 9 mo ) invite participate intervention trial . These infant randomly assign one three group : 1 . “ Sprinkles ” group : Will receive micronutrient Sprinkles begin 6 mo age . 2 . “ Foodlet ” group : Will receive crushable multiple micronutrient tablet begin 6 mo age . 3 . “ Nutributter ” group : Will receive fat-based supplement ( Nutributter ) begin 6 mo age We choose include negative control ( placebo ) group high rate iron vitamin A deficiency population , leave child know anemic untreated 6-mo study period . Instead , assess “ Non-Intervention ” ( NI ) group infants 12 mo age , allow u evaluate attain size micronutrient status absence intervention . The NI group randomly select subset infant record MCH list describe recruitment period intervention trial ( thus meet selection criterion ) , randomly select intervention trial . [ We take infant come MCH clinic month field work would unmanageable . Given birth rate 179/mo , enough `` leave '' month wo n't select intervention , randomly select non-intervention group reach 12 mo . ] We plan recruit approximately 9/mo NI group period 9 month , start 6 mo initiate recruitment intervention ( i.e. , `` left-over '' infant begin reach 12 mo age ) . The MCH list include contact information ( address ) , find NI mother 12 mo . When contact 12 mo , confirm infant would meet eligibility criterion intervention study ( breastfed 5 mo , free congenital abnormality , chronic disease peanut allergy ) , ask participate one-time assessment . At time NI family give compensation equivalent value supplement provide intervention group ( 6-mo supply Nutributter ) . Study site The study conduct Koforidua , population 87,000 average birth rate 179/mo ( 1998 2001 ) . The University Ghana administer project provide scientific technical support study . It also provide office space administrative task laboratory biochemical analysis blood sample . UC Davis provide supervision study Project Manager ( Seth Adu-Afarwuah , doctoral student UC Davis ) , order ship necessary supply equipment . Informed consent procedure : Approval study obtain UC Davis Human Subjects Review Committee University Ghana ( Noguchi Memorial Institute ) Ethics Committee . Consent conduct study town obtain Koforidua Municipal Health Administration . Written consent participate study obtain individually mother infant .
