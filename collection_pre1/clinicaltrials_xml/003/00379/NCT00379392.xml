	<detailed_description>Stroke lead cause chronic disability United States , lack upper limb motor control major contributor stroke-related disability . Physical occupational therapy treatment commonly use reduce long-term disability . Unfortunately , little scientific evidence exist best target patient therapy , define therapy provide , even identify best therapy . A recent National Institutes Health consensus panel decide three therapeutic technique support scientific evidence , one technique , constraint induce therapy , evidence randomize trial . The imagination , probably under-utilized health resource , use remember recreate past , develop insight present , influence physical health , improve creativity inspiration , anticipate possible future . All u , extent , experienced effect imagination body . In recent year , data suggest mental practice improve performance motor skill behavior . These study generally show healthy volunteer train mind specific task usually show good performance compare practice , although less train physically . To date , small attempt use mental practice rehabilitation try . A study subacute stroke patient compare possibility effectiveness program combine imagery physical therapy program physical therapy , show combine two therapy clinically feasible , cost-effective addition therapy may improve functional outcome participation physical therapy . Thus , mental practice physical rehabilitation offer potential way improve motor recovery damage brain . One approach improve arm function among patient stroke intensive repetitive task practice ( RTP ) . This treatment take form functional training alone also include way encourage within constraint induce ( CI ) movement therapy . Repetitive activity often use physical occupational therapy may also improve health relate quality life . While intense treatment , CI therapy , overcome arm impairment may prove helpful , therapy expensive relies one-on-one interaction patient rehabilitation therapist . New therapeutic treatment help exist therapy offer helpful money save alternative must develop improve arm use , also , stroke survivor ' quality life . While RTP mental imagery may promise treatment , clearly understand change may occur brain 's patient stroke follow physical rehabilitation . A study use positron emission tomography ( PET ) functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) measure show blood flow change brain physical movement follow CIT . If way recovery motor function stroke good understood , good decision could make regard best selection specific treatment strategy . The primary aim propose study collect data effort estimate clinical effectiveness implement RTP addition mental imagery training ( MIT ) improve upper extremity motor function quality life chronic stroke patient . One group study ask `` mentally rehearse '' series upper limb functional motor task one half hour per day ( 3-30 minute session ) , guidance audio tape , total 21 hour two week . Another group undergo 10 day ( 6 hour per day ) RTP license rehabilitation specialist well listen MIT tape one half hour per day ( 3-30 minute session . Motor function quality life measure two occasion : intervention immediately intervention . A unique aspect study obtain fMRI data subset patient enrol group . Everything involve study do Center Rehabilitation Medicine Emory University School Medicine Emory University Hospital . This study represent one first try use mental imagery addition physical rehabilitation recovery movement stroke , knowledge , first try use fMRI look change brain mental training . The result study may allow u learn relationship rehabilitation brain function stroke , well confirm idea actual change brain related improving movement body . This study use new therapeutic method along well accept method ( RTP ) effort improve arm movement patient stroke . A thorough approach use determine use mental imagery along RTP change movement arm quality life patient stroke use proven clinical test determine movement performance patient ' quality life . Furthermore , precise brain functioning test ( i.e . fMRI ) perform good understand actual change happen brain stroke patient improved movement arm . Should use MIT RTP well RTP MIT alone , many year randomize clinical trial would suggest determine helpfulness use mental imagery training RTP improve arm function quality life patient stroke . The benefit would reduce cost arm rehabilitation among certain patient stroke well way rehabilitation center prescribe provide therapy target arm . Because short length stay few number therapy session allow in- out-patient service stroke survivor , use additional different delivery system , mental imagery , become important .</detailed_description>
