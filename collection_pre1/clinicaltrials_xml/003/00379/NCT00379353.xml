You complete 7 questionnaire , take 30-60 minute complete . You also blood drawn ( 2 tablespoon ) measure protein level blood . You also body weight measure ask normal food intake . Your body composition measure use measurement include body weight height , skin fold thickness use Lange caliper , bioelectrical impedance use Tanita body composition monitor scale . This non-invasive method measure total body water , total body fat , total body lean mass . The Tanita scale similar typical weight scale , although unlike weight scale , Tanita scale measure body composition . Researchers measure much energy body use rest . Every week , woman able child must negative blood ( 1 tablespoon ) pregnancy test . On Day 8 [ ± 3 day ] , complete 3 questionnaire .

You ask symptom pain , fatigue , nausea , depression , poor appetite , and/or sleep problem . You ask complete 7 questionnaire take 30-60 minute complete . You also body weight measure ask normal food intake . Your body composition measure researcher measure much energy body use rest . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw measure protein level blood . All patient give option receive thalidomide Day 30 [ ± 3 day ] . If decide take thalidomide Days 15-30 , consider off-study . If decide take thalidomide Days 15-30 , remain study Day 30 . On Day 30 [ ± 3 day ] , end-of-study test . On Day 30 [ ± 3 day ] , end-of-study visit . You ask question side effect may experience . You ask symptom pain , fatigue , anxiety , depression , poor appetite , and/or sleep problem . Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw measure protein level blood . You ask complete 7 questionnaire take 30-60 minute complete . You also body weight measure ask normal food intake . Your body composition measure researcher measure much energy body use rest . If develop intolerable side effect , take study . Otherwise , consider off-study either Day 15 [ ± 3 day ] Day 30 [ ± 3 day ] . Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) draw 2 week thalidomide stop check additional side effect . You doctor option continue take thalidomide off-study . You participate S.T.E.P.S.® ( System Thalidomide Education Prescribing Safety ) program . This include additional consent , education prevent pregnancy take thalidomide , complete survey follow rule program . This investigational study . Thalidomide FDA-approved commercially available .
