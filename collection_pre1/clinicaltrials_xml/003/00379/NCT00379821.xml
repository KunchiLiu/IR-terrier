When malaria treat appropriate medicine ( ) , cure completely . The purpose study find good use chloroquine alone combination another drug effectively treat malaria . About 640 child malaria , age 6 month 5 year age , Blantyre Malaria Project Research Clinic Ndirande Health Center Malawi study . They treat either chloroquine alone combination chloroquine plus another medication ( azithromycin artesunate atovaquone-proguanil ) every time get malaria year .

	<detailed_description>Combination therapy become mainstay malaria treatment . In general , goal combination therapy treat resistant infection successfully prevent emergence spread resistance . The antimalarial combination therapy currently use design base optimal pair drug deter development spread parasite resistance individual partner drug setting high malaria transmission . Careful study need identify pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic property drug combination deter resistance prolong useful therapeutic life next generation antimalarial drug combination . Current vivo method measure antimalarial drug efficacy high-transmission area use 14 28-day follow-up period , single episode study miss several critical factor assess efficacy impact antimalarial treatment . When follow-up extend beyond 28 day , case apparent resistance treatment failure find . Single-episode study assess impact therapy incidence malaria time . These limitation standard vivo study lead investigator advocate longitudinal study drug efficacy . In addition measure efficacy individual treatment , longitudinal study measure sustain efficacy repeat use regimen time , scenario accurately reflect real-life use anti-malarial medication . The primary outcome interest incidence malaria episode , well secondary outcome anemia severe malaria , highly relevant public health policy-makers , reflect burden disease also utilization health resource . Longitudinal study also permit assessment pharmacokinetic property drug affect incidence treatment episode . This randomized , open-label , longitudinal drug efficacy trial . Participants include 640 child , age 6 month 5 year , find uncomplicated malaria Blantyre Malaria Project Research Clinic Ndirande Health Centre Blantyre , Malawi . After enrollment , participant randomize one four treatment arm : chloroquine alone chloroquine combination artesunate , atovaquone-proguanil ( AP ) , azithromycin . The treatment outcome assess standard 28-day efficacy study . Participants subsequently evaluate every 4 week encourage return study clinic time ill course one year . If new episode uncomplicated malaria diagnose , participant receive therapy assign enrollment . Polymerase chain reaction-corrected 28-day efficacy evaluate treatment episode . The primary study objective compare annual incidence malaria clinical episode . Secondary objective : assess anti-malarial drug efficacy first administration , treatment arm ; assess anti-malarial drug efficacy subsequent episode malaria , treatment arm ; measure prevalence chloroquine resistant parasites trial , treatment arm ; assess effect treatment arm anemia end study participation ; ass safety drug repeat use ; determine chloroquine blood level chloroquine sensitive resistant parasite able cause infection ; assess effect population movement risk malaria infection ; ass spatial pattern environmental determinant malaria infection .
