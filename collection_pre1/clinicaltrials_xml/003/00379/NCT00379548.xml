	<brief_summary>We hypothesize Asian Americans compare Caucasians , high risk develop pro-inflammatory state may contribute development heart disease diabetes change traditional Asian diet typical Western diet . These inflammatory response reflect activation monocyte measure protein kinase C ( PKC ) , know activator monocyte . We also hypothesize change inflammatory response gingival crevicular fluid ( GCF ) reflect similar change marker plasma monocyte . Specific aim : 1 . To compare inflammatory response ( primarily PKC activation monocyte ) , Far-East Asian Americans Caucasian Americans , change traditional Asian diet typical American diet . 2 . To correlate biochemical change inflammatory response plasma monocyte gingival crevicular fluid ( GCF ) .</brief_summary>
