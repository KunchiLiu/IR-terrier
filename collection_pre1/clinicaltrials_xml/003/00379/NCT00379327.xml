	<detailed_description>General Design This randomize control study pregnant woman determine acupuncture start thirty seven week three day EGA increase percentage woman deliver EDC , 40 week EGA . The study participant recruit three practice utilize St. Francis Hospital Wilmington Delaware , practice hospital well know primary investigator . With permission patient ' physician , chart potentially eligible patient review eligible patient recruit study prior 36 week EGA . Upon enrollment , patient separate nulliparous parous group group randomize study intervention control group . Of note , candidate population comprise English Spanish speaker . All invitational , explanatory , consent material study instrument available English Spanish . In addition demographic information , initial periodic `` quality life '' anxiety inventory administer . Based upon current literature applicability particular study population , State-Trait Anxiety Index ( STAI ) Short Form 36 ( SF-36 ) choose test instrument . Both primary care provider enrol patient ask every week answer single question regard whether think patient receive true placebo acupuncture treatment . This do analyze efficacy blind process . At time enrollment , patient cervical exam perform physician determine individual baseline Bishop 's Score . Subsequently , weekly obstetrical visit patient 's EDC , another cervical examination perform Bishop 's Score obtain assess cervical ripening . Each subject see twice weekly acupuncturist receive either actual acupuncture treatment placebo ( non-puncturing needle ) treatment . Patients identify `` high risk '' base upon clinical judgment primary care physician external uterine pressure monitoring fetal heart rate monitoring acupuncture treatment . The acupuncture treatment administer standardized way single experience medical acupuncturist certify state Pennsylvania , reduce variability study . The acupuncture perform quiet area subject . The newly validate commercially available placebo needle develop Streitberger , et al use 34 identical real needle use procedure placement type needle . Briefly , small bandage apply skin cover thin plastic disk acupuncture site . Either needle place one small hole plastic portion bandage underlie gauze . The sharp real needle easily penetrate skin require depth , resistance impose bandage . The blunt shaft placebo needle applies pressure skin retracts hollow handle , give appearance needle go skin . The bandage gauze hold placebo needle place . The acupuncture needle manipulate second begin middle 30 minute treatment period try elicit sensation call De qi . It sometimes perceive subject dull ache radiates point insertion , detect acupuncturist sense increase resistance . Since real placebo needle group report feeling sensation Streitberger 's validation study publish study 35 blind subject preserve . To ensure blind adequate , prenatal visit postpartum follow visit simple question ask study subject physicians regard type treatment ( real versus placebo acupuncture ) believe subject receive session . Primary Study Endpoints Our goal determine study intervention , acupuncture , increase 30 % number woman timely delivery -- deliver EDC . Our study endpoint EGA time delivery . We answer question : `` Was timely delivery ? '' Primary Safety Endpoints If trial evidence clinically monitor uterine over-stimulation fetal intolerance , patient remain enrol `` intention treat '' , continue acupuncture treatment . If physician caring patient ( obstetrician FP-obstetrician ) concern warrant discontinuation acupuncture treatment , patient withdrawn study follow `` intention treat '' .</detailed_description>
