	<brief_title>Effect NovoTTF-100A Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme ( GBM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PAST CLINICAL EXPERIENCE : The effect electric field generate NovoTTF-100A device ( TTFields ) test two pilot trial human . The data trial suggest NovoTTF-100A may improve time disease progression overall survival recurrent GBM patient . Although number patient pilot trial small , The FDA determine data gather far warrant test NovoTTF-100A treatment possible therapy patient recurrent GBM . DESCRIPTION OF THE TRIAL : Patients GBM whose disease recur progress despite standard treatment ( Surgery , radiation therapy , Temozolomide treatment ) meet requirement participation study randomly assign one two group : 1 . Treatment NovoTTF-100A device , 2 . Treatment best standard care practice participate center . If assign best standard care group , patient receive chemotherapeutic agent chosen base prior treatment standard care practice treat center . If assign NovoTTF-100A group , patient treat continuously long disease stable regressing . NovoTTF-100A treatment consist wear four electrically insulate electrode head . Electrode placement require shave scalp treatment . After initial short hospitalization ( 24 hour ) patient release continue treatment home maintain regular daily routine . During trial , regardless whether assign NovoTTF-100A treatment group best standard care group , patient need return every month hospital outpatient clinic examine physician undergo routine laboratory examination . These routine visit continue long patient 's disease progressing . After progression , occurs , patient need return per month two month outpatient clinic similar follow examination . During visit clinic patient examine physically neurologically . Additionally , routine blood test ECG perform . A routine MRI head perform baseline 2 , 4 6 month . After follow plan , patient contact per month telephone answer basic question health status . SCIENTIFIC BACKGROUND : Electric field exert force electric charge similar way magnet exerts force metallic particle within magnetic field . These force cause movement rotation electrically charge biological building block , much like alignment metallic particle see along line force radiate outwards magnet . Electric field also cause muscle twitch strong enough may heat tissue . TTFields alternate electric field low intensity . This mean change direction repetitively many time second . Since change direction rapidly ( 200 thousand time second ) , cause muscle twitch , effect electrically activate tissue body ( brain , nerve heart ) . Since intensity TTFields body low , cause heating . The breakthrough finding make NovoCure finely tune alternate field low intensity , term TTFields ( Tumor Treating Fields ) , cause significant slow growth cancer cell . Due unique geometric shape cancer cell multiply , TTFields cause building block cell move pile way cell physically explode . In addition , cancer cell also contain miniature building block act tiny motor move essential part cell place place . TTFields cause tiny motor fall apart since special type electric charge . As result two effect , cancer tumor growth slow even reverse continuous exposure TTFields . Other cell body ( normal healthy tissue ) affect much less cancer cell since multiply much slow rate . In addition TTFields direct certain part body , leave sensitive area reach . In conclusion , TTField hold promise serve brand new cancer treatment side effect promise affectivity slow reverse disease .</detailed_description>
