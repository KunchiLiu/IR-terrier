	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess ability tandutinib achieve target tumor/plasma ratio â‰¥ 0.33 patient recurrent glioblastoma undergoing resection . ( Feasibility study ) II . Detect potential biological effect tandutinib measure platelet-derived growth factor receptor phosphorylation status downstream activation Akt Erk . ( Feasibility study ) III . Determine maximum tolerate dose tandutinib patient recurrent progressive glioblastoma . ( Phase I ) IV . Estimate frequency toxicity associate tandutinib patient recurrent progressive glioblastoma . ( Phase I ) V. Describe pharmacokinetics route administration patient recurrent progressive glioblastoma . ( Phase I ) VI . Assess tumor response rate patient recurrent progressive glioblastoma . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate overall survival patient recurrent progressive glioblastoma . ( Phase II ) II . Estimate 6-month progression-free survival rate patient . ( Phase II ) III . Assess toxicity associate tandutinib patient . ( Phase II ) IV . Assess pharmacokinetic profile route administration patient . ( Phase II ) V. Explore protein-expression pattern distinguish patient respond therapy . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This multicenter , prospective , nonrandomized , feasibility study phase I study ( parallel ) follow open label phase II study . FEASIBILITY STUDY : Patients receive oral tandutinib twice daily 7 day . Patients undergo biopsy surgery remove tumor . Within 2 week biopsy surgery , patient receive oral tandutinib twice daily* day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PHASE I : Patients receive oral tandutinib twice daily* day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos tandutinib maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . At least 6 patient treated MTD . [ Note : *On day 1 course 1 , patient receive 1 dose tandutinib . ] PHASE II : Patients receive tandutinib phase I MTD determine phase I . Patients undergo blood sample collection pharmacokinetic study . Patients feasibility portion study also undergo blood tissue sample collection correlative study mass spectrometry tandutinib concentration . Samples also examine circulate endothelial cell plasma protein ( vascular endothelial growth factor [ VEGF ] -A , -B , -C , -D , soluble VEGF receptor [ sVEGFR 's ] , placental growth factor [ P1GF ] , platelet-derived growth factor [ PDGF ] -AA , PDGF-AB , PDGF-BB , angiopoietin-1 -2 , tumstatin , thrombospondin-1 , IL-8 ) potential marker antiangiogenic effect tandutinib . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month .</detailed_description>
