	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , trabectedin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well trabectedin work treat patient advance , persistent , recurrent leiomyosarcoma uterus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trabectedin Treating Patients With Advanced , Persistent , Recurrent Leiomyosarcoma Uterus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine antitumor activity trabectedin , measure frequency duration objective response , patient advance , persistent , recurrent uterine leiomyosarcoma . - Determine nature degree toxicity drug patient . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , multicenter study . Patients receive trabectedin IV continuously 24 hour day 1 . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve confirm complete response may receive least 2 additional course . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 43 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
