	<brief_summary>Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Cetuximab may also stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Bevacizumab may stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving cetuximab together paclitaxel , carboplatin , bevacizumab may kill tumor cell . This phase II trial study well give cetuximab together paclitaxel , carboplatin , bevacizumab work treat patient advance non-small cell lung cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>S0536 : Cetuximab , Paclitaxel , Carboplatin , Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate frequency severity hemorrhage toxicities patient advance non-small cell lung cancer treat combination carboplatin , paclitaxel , cetuximab bevacizumab follow therapy cetuximab bevacizumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression-free overall survival , response rate ( confirm plus unconfirmed , complete plus partial ) , frequency severity non-hemorrhage toxicity group patient treat regimen . II . To perform molecular correlative study patient tissue investigate exploratory manner potential predictor efficacy . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients receive cetuximab IV 1-2 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 paclitaxel IV 3 hour , carboplatin IV 30 minute , bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Patients receive cetuximab IV 1 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
