Healthy volunteer 18 year age old patient 2 year age older suspect primary ciliary dyskinesia ( PCD ) , variant cystic fibrosis ( CF ) pseudohypoaldosteronism ( PHA ) may eligible study . Patients enrol Natural History Study Nontuberculous Mycobacteria NIH NIH natural history protocol may also enrol . Participants undergo follow test procedure 1-day visit NIH Clinical Center , follow : All patient normal volunteer follow procedure : - Physical examination review medical genetic history family genetic history . - Lung function test measurement oxygen saturation level . - Nitric oxide measurement measure amount nitric oxide production nose : A small tube place nose subject breathes mouth cardboard tube . All patient follow additional procedure : - Blood test liver kidney function , blood count , immunoglobulins pregnancy test ( appropriate ) . - Blood test buccal scrape ( brush inside cheek ) obtain DNA look gene mutation cause PCD , CF PHA . - Scrape biopsy cell line inside nose : A small toothpick-sized plastic stick tiny cup end use get nasal line cell look cilia ( hair-like structure move mucus ) . - Semen analysis ( men ) test sperm tail function structure . Patients suspect variant CF PHA , include nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease , follow additional procedure : - Sweat chloride test : A medicine place arm produce sweat ; , low level electric current apply 5 12 minute . Sweat collect plastic tube test salt content . - Blood draw CF genetic testing , necessary , measure level enzyme trypsin . - Saliva collection measure sodium chloride content . - Nasal potential difference measure electrical activity cell line inside nose : A soft plastic tube fill salt solution pass nasal passage sterile needle place skin arm . This test provide information line nose able get use change temperature humidity . ( Normal volunteer also test . )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Disorders Mucociliary Clearance Nontuberculous Mycobacterial Lung Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Nontuberculous mycobacteria ( NTM ) ubiquitous environmental organism increasingly associate human disease , commonly involve lung . Post menopausal Caucasian woman seem particularly predispose development peripheral nodule dilate airway ( bronchiectasis ) associate organism . These woman distinguish body characteristic taller thinner age gender match control yet identifiable systemic immune defect . There , however , considerable overlap genetic disorder mucociliary clearance cystic fibrosis ( CF ) primary ciliary dyskinesia ( PCD ) . The Genetic Diseases Mucociliary Clearance Consortium ( GDMCC ) one 10 consortium Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network form Office Rare Diseases collaboration NCRR , NICHD , NINDS , NIAMS , NIDDK , NHLBI response Rare Diseases Act 2002 . The GDMCC comprise 5 geographically-dispersed clinical research site design study rare disease involve defect clearance mucus secretion airway ( defective `` mucociliary clearance '' ) . These site collaborate diagnostic , genetic , study patient impairment mucociliary clearance , include primary ciliary dyskinesia ( PCD ) , variant cystic fibrosis ( CF ) , pseudohypoaldosteronism ( PHA ) . These study also applicable disease alter airway clearance may play primary contributory role nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease , chronic granulomatous disease , hyper-IgE syndrome . Disorders PCD , CF , PHA reflect genetic defect airway host-defense , typically result chronic infection airway . Patients disorder conduct airways sinus delay ( incorrect ) diagnosis , diagnostic test readily available . These patient may also sub-optimal management clinical disease , cause disorder well-defined , treatment regimen usually drive evidence-based medicine . Aims : The major aim study employ systematic approach diagnostic functional evaluation patient chronic airway disease individual patient , good define host susceptibility infection environmental organisms nontuberculous mycobacteria , potentially lead development well diagnostic technique , include genetic testing . In addition , compare/contrast clinical feature ( phenotype ) across disorder . A rigorous cross-sectional comparison clinical feature provide good understand clinical disease disorder ; turn lead well standard clinical care , also assist identification novel therapeutic approach . Methods : This cross-sectional diagnostic / mechanistic protocol investigate airway host-defenses . The patient population study include individual recur airway infection nontuberculous mycobacteria lung disease may defective airway host defense predispose factor , individual carry tentative diagnosis three know genetic disorder mucociliary clearance ( PCD , variant CF , PHA ) , individual suspect one disorder inadequate inconclusive diagnostic test . Individuals latter category must preliminary clinical evaluation evaluate common disorder may similar manifestation include classical CF , immunodeficiency , asthma , severe gastroesophageal reflux . The evaluation include detailed assessment clinical feature ; specialize laboratory measurement nasal potential difference evaluate function chloride sodium channel associate CF PHA , nasal biopsy specimen nasal nitric oxide measurement assess cilia structure function abnormal PCD ; genetic study identify disease - cause mutation gene associate CF , PCD , PHA .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Overview : Inclusion criterion reflect twofold purpose protocol . It primarily intend evaluate cohort patient follow NIH Clinical Center Protocol 01I0202 , Natural History , Genetics , Phenotype , Treatment Mycobacterial Infections , regard , inclusion criterion mirror protocol . Secondly part multicenter collaborative protocol participate site Genetic Disorders Mucociliary Clearance Consortium , one Rare Disease Clinical Consortia sponsor Office Rare Diseases . There clearcut need geographically disperse center expertise diagnostic evaluation treatment patient rare disease airway , include patient suspected PCD , nonclassical variant CF , PHA . The 5 site perform rigorous diagnostic evaluation utilize innovative , standardized method ( SOPs contain Manual Operations ) . As participate site Consortium , cast broad net include many participant feasible . This include multicenter standardized diagnostic evaluation clinical evaluation , give u good chance define clinical spectrum disease . The criterion participant enter study mandate patient either enrol 01I0202 , Natural History , Genetics , Phenotype , Treatment Mycobacterial Infections relate NIH Natural History Protocol , refer part Consortium , receive standard ( current clinical practice ) diagnostic evaluation include test asthma , severe gastroesophageal reflux and/or classic CF , prior enrol Consortium study . Healthy adult control participant enrol comparison assessment noninvasive nasal nitric oxide nasal potential difference measurement . The health status control participant assess standardized clinical history , family history , physical exam include height weight , vital sign , oximetry , spirometry measurement . To enter study , individual suspect mucociliary clearance defect ( n=100 ) must age 2 year old meet one 4 follow profile : 1 . Have know suspect nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease enrol Protocol 01I0202 , Natural History , Genetics , Phenotype , Treatment Mycobacterial Infections . 2 . Have high suspicion diagnosis PCD , base ciliary ultrastructural change EM ( perform elsewhere prior referral ) clinical feature ( chronic sinopulmonary disease , chronic otitis medium , history neonatal respiratory distress situs inversus ) , PCD sibling one clinical feature PCD . 3 . Have chronic sinopulmonary disease clinical feature overlap variant CF PCD , diagnostic test rule classical CF ( sweat Cl test CF gene mutation screen ) . This may include patient know immune deficiency chronic granulomatous disease follow NIH natural history protocol . 4 . Known suspected PHA ( variant PHA ) , might include elevate ( borderline ) sweat Cl value . To enter study healthy control ( n=25 ) , individual must age 18 old free know disease , chronic medical condition , family history cystic fibrosis primary ciliary dyskinesia , cognitive impairment significant disability might preclude voluntary consent ability safely comply instruction sit test . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Persons evaluate Clinical Center severe cognitive impairment severe disability precludes ability understand instruction sit/lie still evaluation exclude . Certain condition may preclude specific procedure include protocol , may still allow pertinent part diagnostic evaluation . These conditions/procedures may include : pregnancy/Chest PA/Lat xray ; allergy pilocarpine /sweat test . For reversible condition acute upper airway infection , significant epistaxis within prior week ( related # 2 ) , low airway infection uncontrollable coughing , participant may need reschedule upon resolution . For nasal nitric oxide nasal potential difference measurement nasal mucosal scrape biopsy : 1 . Anatomic abnormality nose sinus ( e.g . complete sinus blockage turbinatectomy ) preclude either measurement nasal nitric oxide nasal potential difference . 2 . A severe bleeding diathesis condition hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome may predispose significant nasal bleed result severely excoriate nasal mucosa . 3 . Inability sit still 15 minute nasal catheter hold mucosal surface transepithelial potential difference measurement . This would include presence acute chronic low respiratory tract infection result uncontrollable cough . 4 . Diffuse skin condition would preclude placement subcutaneous reference electrode ( butterfly needle ) nasal PD measurement .</criteria>
