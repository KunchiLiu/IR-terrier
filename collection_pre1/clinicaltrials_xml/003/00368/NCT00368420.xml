	<brief_title>Validation Score Predictive Factors Complete Resection Platinum-sensitive Recurrent Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The multicentre retrospective study AGO-DESKTOP OVAR 1 investigate multicentre-setting question prognostic factor successful ( i.e . complete ) debulking recurrence . That way , hypothesis score 3 factor could develop : - PS ECOG = 0 - tumor-free primary surgery ( unknown : FIGO I/II ) - Ascites &lt; 500 ml . The goal study evaluate prospective multicentre setting , extent retrospectively define AGO-score predictive validity . The criterion aim therefore rate complete tumor resection three score characteristic present invasive epithelial platinum-sensitive ovarian- , fallopian tube- primary peritoneal cancer . This study second series three : ( 1 ) hypothesis build potential predictive score resectability , ( 2 ) prospective confirmation AGO-score , ( 3 ) application AGO-score inclusion criterion eligible patient formal comparison role secondary debulking relapse ovarian cancer could perform .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients recurrence invasive epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer initial stage relapse tumorfree interval least 6 month completion firstline therapy . The interval applies patient second relapse enrol complete platinumcontaining reinduction therapy . Women age &gt; 18 year Patients give sign write informed consent data transmission processing Patients nonepithelial tumor well borderline tumor Patients undergo secondlook surgery completion surgery end chemotherapy interval Only study collective : patient second malignancy treat laparotomy , well neoplasias , treatment could interfere treatment relapsed ovarian cancer Patients third recurrence Patients socalled platinumrefractory tumor , i.e . progression chemotherapy recurrence within 6 month end former platinumcontaining therapy</criteria>
