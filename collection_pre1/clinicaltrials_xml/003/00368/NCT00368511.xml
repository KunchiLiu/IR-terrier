	<brief_summary>We propose obtain computerized dynamic posturography score patient ( psycho ) geriatric nursing home utilizing CAPS system Vestibular Technology . This instrument validate measure human stability associate Fall Probability percentage . Subjects ask stand platform eye open close approximately 30 second . The data obtain utilized base change compare outcome music listen fall prevention . Previous investigation demonstrate decrease fall rate associated music listening . We would like measure change human stability associate potential decrease fall rate . We would also like use history fall test individual available . In case fall statistic available respectfully request access fall data available involved geriatric nursing home . The fall data keep confidential use control statistic evaluation fall rate implementation application . The music use include Nolwenn Leroy , Mozart Dutch French Singers .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The outcome measurement obtain use computerized dynamic posturography , standard diagnostic test balance function . The subject 's balance test use three-component force platform ( BalanceTRAK® CAPST - Vestibular Technologies , Cheyenne WY , USA ) one sensory condition modify Clinical Test Sensory Interaction Balance ( mCTSIB ) , eye close perturb surface condition . This condition choose study show single test best correlate balance impairment fall . The stability score , already use several study author use primary outcome measure research . It define 1 minus ratio measure sway test ( computed major axis standard 95 % confidence ellipse ) amount sway normal subject height one test able sway fall ( also know theoretical maximum sway theoretical limit stability , calculate use regression formula base subject 's height develop NASA 1962 commonly use posturographic test ) . For convenience , stability score express percentage . Its definition make convenient easy understand measure use subject able stand perfectly still sway score 100 % , whereas one sway much limit stability score 0 % . During test , subject 's sway determine force platform relate software . The CAPST three-component force platform use 3 load cell arrange triangle measure distribution vertical ground reaction force platform . The analog load cell signal amplify simultaneously sample platform electronics use three synchronize individual 24bit delta-sigma analog digital converter sample 312kHz decimate sample data rate 64Hz . The use three A/D converter insure signal 3 load cell acquire simultaneously time error . The high sampling rate high decimation low data rate sigma-delta converter eliminate aliasing provide resolution 4 part per million . The digital load cell data send via USB connection PC software use calibration matrix determine manufacturer compute total vertical force two horizontal moment act platform . From data , software compute point application vertical force act platform , commonly refer Center Pressure ( CoP ) . The location CoP coincide static condition projection subject 's Center Mass ( CoM ) onto platform , movement relate movement subject 's CoM ( sway ) . The determination actual sway require determination instantaneous location CoM require determination location inertial property body segment specific subject test . The CAPST , like every posturographic equipment , use movement CoP approximation sway . Because approximation , kinetic reason CoP move CoM , 95 % confidence interval CoP motion consider . This allow CAPST software compute ellipse represent location sway sample collect test 95 % confidence . The major axis ellipse represent maximum sway subject direction test use compute stability score . To assess accuracy resolution measurement chain , calibrate weight 75kg 100kg position center force platform ( subject ) 20 acquisition perform : accuracy weight calibrate fall within instrument 's factory specification ( +-2N ) . Therefore accuracy position claim manufacturer +-1mm weight 75kg accept correct determination would require specialized equipment software available manufacturer . It note overall accuracy position CoP give instrument relevant study sway determined motion CoP . The sway measurement error estimate consider fact test weight dead weight move , measurement chain indicate `` sway '' le 0.05mm ( measurement noise ) , therefore resolution measurement chain sway measurement error consider 0.05mm . To verify repeatability measurement chain , type test repeat two time , obtain similar result ( within specify accuracy resolution ) . Given sway measurement error , measurement error stability score determine . From definition stability score clear least theoretical limit stability , pronounced effect sway measurement error . As theoretical limit stability compute use formula 0.55*height*2*sin ( 6.25° ) , short subject , stability score sensitive measurement error . To estimate stability score measurement error subject 's height 1.6m consider . Such subject would theoretical limit stability 191.6mm . For subject , sway measurement error 0.05mm mean stability score measurement error 0.05/191.6 , score express percentage , 0.026 % . Thus , change stability score great consequence subject 's sway measurement error . Inpatients Dutch Geriatric Hospitals randomize several group CAPS test obtain . The group ask listen music specific song morning CAPS test obtain listen experience one month interval throughout study . Fall data collect well compare previous fall data . The change CAPS outcomes measure brain base postural change compare normative data type music listen .</detailed_description>
