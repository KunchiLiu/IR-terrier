	<brief_summary>Patients type lymph gland cancer call HD , NHL lymphoepithelioma ( 3 disease refer `` Lymphoma '' ) . The lymphoma come back go away treatment ( include best treatment know cancer ) . This research study use special immune system cell call TGFb-resistant LMP-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( DNR-CTL ) , new experimental therapy . Some patient Lymphoma show sign infection virus cause infectious mononucleosis Epstein Barr virus ( EBV ) time diagnosis Lymphoma . EBV find cancer cell 1/2 patient Lymphoma , suggest may play role cause Lymphoma . The cancer cell infect EBV able hide body 's immune system escape kill release substance call Transforming Growth Factor-beta ( TGFb ) . The investigator want see special white blood cell ( call T cell ) give gene hope let survive TGFb train kill EBV infected cell also survive blood kill tumor . Investigators use sort therapy specially trained T cell treat different type cancer occur bone marrow solid organ transplant call post transplant lymphoma . In type cancer able successfully prevent treat post transplant lymphoma . However use similar approach HD patient partial response therapy , patient complete response . In follow-up study try find could improve treatment grow T cell recognize 2 protein express Lymphoma cell call LMP-1 LMP2a . These special T cell call LMP-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes ( CTLs ) . Although patient tumor response , CTL therapy alone cure lot disease . Investigators think reason tumor cell release TGFb ( substance inhibit growth function CTLs ) . For reason , want find make CTL resistant TGFb put new gene call TGFb resistance gene . Investigators hope n't know improve treatment relapse lymphoma . These TGFb-resistant LMP-specific CTLs investigational product approve FDA . The purpose study find large safe dose TGFb resistant LMP-specific CTLs , learn side effect see whether therapy might help patient HD , NHL lymphoepithelioma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigators test biopsy tumor see tumor cell EBV positive see subject eligible study . Then take blood donor , use grow T cell . First grow special type cell call dendritic cell ( monocyte ) , stimulate T cell add specially produce human adenovirus carry LMP1 LMP-2a gene dendritic cell ( monocyte ) . Addition gene cell know gene transfer . These dendritic cell ( monocyte ) use stimulate T cell . The stimulation train T cell kill cell LMP surface . Investigators make LMP-specific CTLs stimulating EBV infect cell ( make subject 's blood donor 's blood infecting EBV laboratory ) . They also put adenovirus carry LMP1 LMP2 gene EBV infect cell increase amount LMP1 LMP2 , cell . These EBV infect cell treat radiation grow . Once sufficient number T cell make , investigator test see kill cell LMP surface . To make sure cell wo n't attack subject tissues test cell skin cell T cell grow laboratory . To make CTL resistant effect TGFb release tumor put new gene call mutant TGFb receptor . Investigators use mouse retrovirus change stop causing infection add mutant TGFb receptor cell . WHAT THE INFUSION WILL BE LIKE : After cell make , frozen . If subject agree participate study , time schedule treat , cell thaw injected subject 10 minute . Initially two dos T cell give two week apart . If second infusion , reduction size subject 's lymphoma ( increase ) CT MRI scan assess radiologist , subject receive six additional dos would benefit , would like receive dos , enough product remain give additional dos . This dose escalation study investigators n't know high dose T cell new gene safe . To find , give cell 2 participant one dose level . If safe raise dose give next group participant . The dose subject get depend many participant get agent react . The investigator tell subject information . All Treatments give Center Cell Gene Therapy Texas Children 's Hospital Houston Methodist Hospital . FOLLOW-UP STUDIES We follow subject injection . Total time participation study 15 year .</detailed_description>
