	<brief_title>Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Treatment Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Sleep apnea occur 60-96 % stroke survivor associate poor functional recovery high post-stroke mortality . Among patient without stroke , continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) safe effective treatment sleep apnea . This feasibility pilot study step plan future efficacy trial CPAP patient acute ischemic stroke . OBJECTIVES The primary objective , among acute ischemic stroke patient , : ( 1 ) determine feasibility perform polysomnography ; ( 2 ) refine process provide CPAP within 48-hours stroke onset ; ( 3 ) determine effect CPAP blood pressure . METHODS This randomize control feasibility study enroll 100 acute ischemic stroke patient . Intervention patient ( N=60 ) receive CPAP within 48 hour stroke onset continue 30 day . At 30 day post-enrollment , intervention patient undergo unattended polysomnography . Control ( N=40 ) patient receive unattended polysomnography baseline 30 day . SIGNIFICANCE CPAP represent important new potential therapy acute stroke . CPAP may reduce neurological symptom severity acute stroke prevent stroke recurrence .</detailed_description>
