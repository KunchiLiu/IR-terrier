	<brief_summary>Subjects ask participate study treatment disease require receive stem cell transplant . Stem cell `` mother '' cell source normal blood cell lead recovery blood count bone marrow transplantation . Unfortunately , perfectly match stem cell donor ( like sister brother ) subject 's disease consider rapidly progressive permit enough time identify another donor ( like someone registry list relative ) . We , however , identify close relative subject 's whose stem cell perfect match , use . However , type donor , typically increase risk develop graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , high rate transplant failure , long delay recovery immune system . GVHD serious sometimes fatal side effect stem cell transplant . GVHD occur new donor cell ( graft ) recognize body tissue patient ( host ) different donor . When happen , cell graft may attack host organ , primarily skin , liver , intestine . The number occurrences harshness severe GVHD depend several factor , include degree genetic difference donor recipient , intensity pre-treatment conditioning regimen , quantity transplant cell , recipient 's age . In recipient mismatch family member match unrelated donor stem cell transplant , great risk GVHD 70-90 % recipient unchanged marrow develop severe GVHD could include symptom marked diarrhea , liver failure , even death . In effort low occurrence severity graft-versus-host disease patient low rate transplant failure , would like specially treat donor 's blood cell remove cell likely attack patient 's tissue . This occur combination intense conditioning treatment patient receive transplant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To participate study , subject need central line ( thin plastic catheter tube place surgery one large vein neck chest ) . Also treatment begin , test subject 's blood virus cause problem transplant . Before treatment begin , stem cell collect donor select best match subject . White blood cell collect donor . The cell mixed special protein call CD34 antibody bind stem cell separate white blood cell special machine call CLINIMACs CD34 Reagent System laboratory . This investigational experimental device approve FDA . Although device approve use country , use year approve country . The stem cell collect frozen start give chemotherapy . TREATMENT PLAN To prepare subject 's body transplantation , subject give high dose chemotherapy ( also call condition treatment ) 8 day prior transplant follow : The subject give drug call Ara-C high dos central line every 12 hour start 8 day transplant ( call day - 8 ) 5 day transplant ( call day - 5 ) . Starting one day receive first Ara-C dose ( day - 7 ) , add drug call cyclophosphamide day treatment next two day . This give high dos ( also central line ) . Also day - 7 , add drug call MESNA . MESNA use decrease side effect cause cyclophosphamide . After medication treatment finish ( day - 4 ) , radiation treatment give entire body twice day 4 day . The chemotherapy radiation treatment last 8 day . If subject abnormal cell spinal fluid , 6 extra daily dos radiation treatment may give head . This would do drug give subject admit transplant . NOTE : Depending subject health status , doctor may decide subject receive Ara-C . If possibility , doctor discus subject . On second day radiation ( day -3 ) , subject receive CAMPATH-1H daily 4-hour IV ( intravenous , vein ) . The subject receive infusion day total three day . CAMPATH 1H special type protein call antibody , work certain type blood cell . CAMPATH 1H important stay active body long time infusion , mean may work long prevent GVHD symptom . The day radiation treatment complete ( day 0 ) , subject receive specially select donor stem cell . Once bloodstream , cell go bone marrow begin grow . If subject risk develop GVHD subject begin develop GVHD , doctor prescribe medicine help prevent treat side effect . The doctor describe medicine time . To learn way new cell grow blood take research purpose approximately 3 month , 6 month , 9 month , year transplant . On day 100 , subject tests/evaluations subject experience since transplant , however , subject also bone marrow aspirate ( take sample bone marrow evaluate disease GVHD status ) . For patient develop GVHD , may additional bone marrow aspirate day 180 ( 2 month previous one ) . After day 365 , subject ask return clinic year evaluation . These evaluation similar one subject day 100 .</detailed_description>
