	<detailed_description>In effort broaden option pharmacotherapy alcoholism , study examine effect sertraline , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) , treatment alcohol dependence . The study base evidence , although SSRI therapy appropriate alcoholic , exist substantial subgroup alcoholic SSRIs appear exert clinically important effect . Sertraline among widely prescribe psychotropic medication world . Consequently , study examine safety efficacy sertraline , mechanism duration effect best method subtyping alcoholic identify individual medication likely produce clinically important reduction drinking behavior . The study employ parallel-group , prospective design randomization balance patient subtype ( early-onset/late-onset ) relevant pretreatment measure approximately equal number subject assign treatment sertraline ( maximum 200 mg/day ) placebo . The study include 14-week treatment period ; 2 week medication taper , efficacy evaluate first 12 treatment week . A total 160 early-onset late-onset alcoholic randomize . Daily process measure positive negative event , global perceive stress , mood , desire drink , drink frequency intensity , collect use interactive voice response technology , provide insight mechanism sertraline may exert effect . Coping-skills train provide weekly first 6 week , every week last 8 week study . A 6-month post-treatment follow-up period evaluate duration medication effect . This study also examine relation genotype number relevant locus risk alcohol dependence response sertraline treatment .</detailed_description>
