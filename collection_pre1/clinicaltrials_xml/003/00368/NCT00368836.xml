	<brief_summary>A pulmonary embolism ( PE ) blockage one arteries lung , usually cause travel blood clot . The D-dimer blood test currently use diagnose PEs , always accurate individual recently undergo surgery inflammatory-provoking disease . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness Carboximeter , new PE diagnostic device measure carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) oxygen ( O2 ) output , individual risk develop PEs .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PE second lead cause sudden , unexpected death United States . In 90 % case , cause deep vein thrombosis : blood clot form vein , travels bloodstream , lodge lung . PE symptom vary , include cough , shortness breath , chest pain , rapid breathing , increased heart rate . Some medical procedure diseases activate inflammation blood coagulation , thereby make individual vulnerable PE . Surgery , kidney dialysis , cancer , connective tissue disease , infectious disease , 70 year old put individual increase risk develop PEs . A common screen test PE D-dimer blood test , measure level specific protein release follow PE . This test , however , proven unreliable diagnostic tool individual high risk PE . A reliable diagnostic tool need . The Carboximeter new device measure ratio CO2/O2 pressure individual 's expired breath . By monitor component , researcher may able accurately diagnose PEs high risk individual . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness Carboximeter diagnose PE individual risk develop PEs . This study conduct two phase . In Phase I , CO2/O2 ratio D-dimer level measure prior follow orthopedic cancer-related surgery 100 individual risk develop PEs . In Phase II , measurement carry 350 high risk individual experience PE symptom . These individual also undergo compute tomography ( CT ) angiography venography , blood flow visualize use x-ray . A follow-up evaluation occur 30 day later . If participant Phase I II experience PE medical condition affect lung , asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , researcher may schedule follow-up evaluation obtain repeat measurement .</detailed_description>
