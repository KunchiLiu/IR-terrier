	<brief_title>Phase I Dose Escalation Stereotactic Radiosurgical Boost Locally Advanced Esophageal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluate safety feasibility deliver radiation dose escalation use hypofractionated radiosurgery locally advanced esophageal cancer . The dose escalation deliver use image-guided radiosurgical boost tumor volume , follow neoadjuvant regimen consist oxaliplatin , capecitabine , conventionally fractionate radiotherapy . In addition , evaluate utility PET-FDG neoadjuvant chemoradiation predict pathologic response pre-operative treatment . We study effect regimen pathologic complete response rate complete resection rate surgery among patient locally advanced esophageal cancer determine pattern failure rate progression-free survival . Finally , plan characterize exploratory manner correlation molecular marker pathologic finding follow pre-operative chemoradiation .</detailed_description>
