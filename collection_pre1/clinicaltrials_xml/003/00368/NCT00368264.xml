	<brief_summary>Background : Standard therapy ill-defined patient systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) suffer membraneous form Lupus nephritis ( WHO class V ) . Therapeutic option use present include azathioprine . In small , open label safety study , patient lupus nephritis , include patient membraneous lupus nephritis , experience long-lasting therapeutic response , sustain reduction proteinuria , follow 10 week course 4 infusion infliximab combination azathioprine . This short course appear safe regard SLE activity , despite increase autoantibody level . Study hypothesis : 1 . The combination four infusion infliximab ( 5 mg/kg body weight ) administer week 0 , 2,6 , 10 , azathioprine fast azathioprine alone reduce proteinuria less 1.5 g/day patient active lupus nephritis WHO class V ( proteinuria &gt; 3g/day ) . 2 . This combination therapy show tolerable safety profile regard SLE activity infection .</brief_summary>
