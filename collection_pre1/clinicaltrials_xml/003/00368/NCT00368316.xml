We improve immunogenicity Shigella conjugate show mouse adult human . Now apply evaluate safety , immunogenicity efficacy improve conjugate 1 4 years-old child Israel . In Israel , shigellosis common especially child . S. sonnei ( Group D ) comprise 60 % isolates follow S. flexneri ( Group B ) : Shigella dysenteriae type 1 ( Group A ) found . We propose administer 2 injection either S. sonnei-CRM9 S. flexneri type 2a-rEPAsucc 6 week apart random double-blind fashion 6,000 1 4 year-olds . Active surveillance vaccinee enteric infection maintain least 2 year evaluate effect vaccination .</brief_summary>
