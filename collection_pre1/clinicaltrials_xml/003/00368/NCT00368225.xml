	<brief_summary>This study explore severe scar liver ( cirrhosis ) develop rapidly hepatitis C-infected patient liver transplant possibly kidney transplant patient well . The hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) cause cirrhosis 20 percent infected person . Generally , take 20 year cirrhosis develop . After liver transplantation , however , patient may develop cirrhosis little 5 year . Cirrhosis develop rapidly kidney transplant patient , may develop fast people undergo transplantation . The study look possible role immune-suppressing medication give liver kidney transplant patient increase severity hepatitis C infection speed cirrhotic process . Patients 18 year age old chronic HCV infection require liver transplant end-stage liver disease kidney transplant kidney failure may eligible study . Liver transplant patient recruit Inova Fairfax Liver Transplant Center Fairfax , Virginia , Georgetown University Medical Center Liver Transplant Institute Washington , D.C. Kidney transplant patient recruit Transplantation Branch National Institute Diabetes Digestive Kidney Diseases . Participants undergo follow procedure : - Regular care : As part regular transplant-related treatment , patient medical history , physical examination blood draw transplant regularly schedule visit transplant . - Blood draws research : Special blood test do measure immune response HCV . They measure amount HCV blood , number HCV strain present change time HCV antibody blood . - Liver biopsy : This procedure do 3 month , 1 year , 3 year 5 year transplant determine extent scar liver study immune response within liver , proportion liver cell infect HCV presence scar-producing cell . The biopsy do 1- 2-day inpatient hospital stay . The patient give sedative medication vein procedure . The skin biopsy site numb biopsy needle pass rapidly liver collect small sample liver tissue study . - Apheresis : This procedure do collect large number white blood cell need test immune response HCV . On day liver biopsy , blood drawn needle vein one arm run machine separate collect white cell . The red cell plasma return patient 's body needle second needle arm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Nearly patient hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) relate end-stage liver disease receive orthotopic liver transplant ( OLT ) develop hepatitis C reinfection graft transplantation . Most patient progress chronic hepatitis 20-30 % experience rapid progression cirrhosis . It unclear generally take 20 year progression cirrhosis initial HCV infection , little five year OLT . Additionally , paradoxical hepatitis C , think immune-mediated , advance rapidly patient immune suppress . Rapid fibrosis progression post-transplantation likely relate complex interaction viral factor , host immune response induction maintenance immunosuppression prevention graft rejection . This study design observational , hypothesis-generating pilot study patient chronic hepatitis C require organ transplantation concomitant immunosuppression . Patients require liver-transplant chronic hepatitis C-related end-stage liver disease patient hepatitis C require kidney transplant renal failure enrol follow five year . Virologic , immunologic intrahepatic parameter correlate level immunosuppression , degree fibrosis , progression cirrhosis liver-related death study subject . The objective study : 1 ) determine proportion patient hepatitis C progress bridge fibrosis cirrhosis three five year liver kidney transplantation ( rapid-progressors ) ; 2 ) compare virologic , host-immune intrahepatic factor rapid-progressors non-progressors slow progressors ; 3 ) characterize relationship general HCV-specific immune response extent liver fibrosis ; 4 ) develop predictive model discriminate rapid-progressors non- slow-progressors .</detailed_description>
