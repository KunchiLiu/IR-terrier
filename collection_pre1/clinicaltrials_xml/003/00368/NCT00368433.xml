	<brief_summary>This study investigate sensitivity touch smell patient Tourette syndrome ( TS ) may differ people without TS . TS neurological disorder cause people uncontrolled movement call `` tic . '' A tic also vocal , like cough bark string bad word . The tic precede `` premonitory urge '' may feel like itch pressure build tic occurs . To patient , tic feel like response involuntary sensation . In patient TS , sensory information may process differently people without TS . This study compare strong sensation feel TS patient healthy volunteer . It also look muscle activity may responsible feeling area tic . Healthy normal volunteer people Tourette syndrome , 18 65 year age , may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history brief physical neurological examination . TS patient complete questionnaire tic interview psychiatrist . Women become pregnant urine pregnancy test prior procedure . Pregnant woman participate . All participant undergo sensory test touch smell . They ask distinguish scent scentless object rate strongly feel scent . Later , eye close , ask tell whether touched , rate intensely felt touch . In addition sensory testing , TS patient , normal volunteer , undergo electromyography ( EMG ) , test measure electrical activity muscle . For surface EMG , small metal disk call electrode fill conductive gel tap skin . Wire EMG involve insert wire muscle use needle . All patient surface EMG consent also wire EMG .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : This study explore sensory phenomenon associate Tourette syndrome ( TS ) . The first part evaluate threshold level versus perceive intensity tactile olfactory stimuli area report hypersensitive TS patient . The second part use electromyography ( EMG ) seek correlation muscle activity perceive intensity `` urge '' focal area premonitory sensation . STUDY POPULATION : Twenty-six patient 22 control subject study . Subjects race , gender , handedness , age 18 65 year . DESIGN : To determine olfactory tactile threshold , n-butanol Von Frey hair present forced-choice modified method limit paradigms . Perceived intensity examine use generalize labeled magnitude scale ( gLMS ) , whose word value place ruler numerical reporting . Randomly arrange series 7 stimuli olfaction touch present 4 set , subject report number gLMS corresponds intensity sensation . Both threshold intensity measure peroneal nerve territory subject , one variable place , match 1:1 patient control . The variable spot consist patient 's sensory tic site . Next , EMG activity measure 8 muscle area sensory tic . Patients report sensory tic occurring , ask resist motor tic least 12 second point . Total EMG activity measure muscle surround sensation 1 , 4 , 7 second tic . OUTCOME MEASURES : Outcome measure include sensory threshold value olfaction touch report intensity value . The outcome measure EMG study include power total EMG activity time point tic .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Healthy Volunteers age 18 65 give consent . Patients age 18 65 clinically document Tourette 's syndrome chronic motor tic disorder define DSMIVTR ( American Psychiatric Association , 2000 ) evaluation tic severity use Yale Tic Scale ( YGTS ) . This criterion establish preliminary screening NINDS Movement Disorders Outpatient Clinic . Structure Clinical Interview ( DSMIV SCID ) administer patient ensure strict DSMIV criterion Tourette Syndrome meet assess possible comorbid psychiatric disorder . Patients least moderate premonitory urge , evaluate PUTS . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects young 18 old 65 year . Subjects 1 ) major depression , 2 ) bipolar disorder , 3 ) psychotic disorder . Subjects unable abstain alcohol psychiatric medication 24 hour prior study . Subjects acute chronic upper respiratory illness , nasal allergy , subject use medication treat condition , include antihistamine , nasal topical steroid , vasoconstrictor nasal spray , normal saline spray . Women pregnant . Individuals Restless Legs syndrome . Individuals diagnosis peripheral neuropathy .</criteria>
