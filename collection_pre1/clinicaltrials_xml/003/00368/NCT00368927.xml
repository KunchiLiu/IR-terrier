	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study sulindac see well work compare placebo prevent lung cancer current former smoker bronchial dysplasia . Chemoprevention use certain drug keep cancer forming , grow , come back . The use sulindac may prevent lung cancer form patient bronchial dysplasia . It yet know whether sulindac effective placebo prevent lung cancer patient bronchial dysplasia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sulindac Preventing Lung Cancer Current Former Smokers With Bronchial Dysplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare change histologic grade bronchial dysplasia , determine mucosal biopsy sample obtain pre- post-intervention autofluorescence bronchoscopy exam , current former smoker bronchial dysplasia treat sulindac v placebo . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare change number dysplastic lesion , determine mucosal biopsy sample obtain pre- post-intervention autofluorescence bronchoscopy exam , patient treat regimen . II . Compare change tissue-based biomarkers ( cyclooxygenase [ COX ] -2 , 15-lipoxygenase [ LOX ] -1 , PPAR γ , Ki-67 , caspase-3 , cyclin D1 , cyclin E ) patient treat regimen . III . Determine safety adverse event profile regimens patient . IV . Describe frequency pattern bronchial dysplasia well biomarker characteristic patient treat regimen . V. Establish biospecimen repository archive future correlative study . OUTLINE : This multicenter , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled study . Patients stratify accord smoking status ( current v former ) , prior lung cancer ( yes v ) , number baseline dysplastic lesion ( 1-3 v &gt; 3 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive oral sulindac twice daily 6 month . ARM II : Patients receive oral placebo twice daily 6 month . Bronchoscopic examination mucosal biopsy perform baseline completion study treatment . Tissue sample examine immunohistochemistry biological marker , include Ki-67 , caspase-3 , cyclooxygenase-2 , cyclin D1 , cyclin E , vascular endothelial growth factor , PPAR γ , 15-lipoxygenase-1 . Blood sample collect serum cotinine . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
