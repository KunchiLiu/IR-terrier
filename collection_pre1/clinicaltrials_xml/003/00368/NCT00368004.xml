	<brief_summary>This study identify gene responsible uveal coloboma , abnormal development eye cause incomplete closure normally-occurring gap eye ( optic fissure ) fifth week life human embryo . There study family one person affect disorder . Coloboma occur 1 10,000 live birth may cause significant vision loss . Researchers seek well understanding gene responsible disorder . Adults child one member family uveal coloboma may eligible study . Patients undergo detailed medical history eye examination appropriate age . The pupil dilate , use eye drop . Dilation continue 4 6 hour , wear sunglass reduce temporary glare many patient may experience brightly lit area . In addition , picture take front back eye , procedure also involve dilation pupil . Patients coloboma undergo complete physical examination . Blood sample collect , total 2 tablespoon patient age 10 old 1 teaspoon 5 pound body weight young patient . Also , patient coloboma may ask undergo X-rays , ultrasound , test medically indicate . To enough DNA study , researcher may create cell line grow DNA . Laboratory sample cod identify information participant study . No test research do blood sample collect unless patient give permission . The researcher provide information patient ' health people without express permission .</brief_summary>
