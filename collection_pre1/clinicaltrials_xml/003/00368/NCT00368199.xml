	<detailed_description>PD progressive neurodegenerative illness affect 50.000 people Netherlands . Diagnosis base clinical criterion . However , purely clinical ground , especially early stage , possible differentiate PD parkinsonian syndrome like multiple system atrophy , Progressive Supranuclear Palsy , vascular parkinsonism , drug induce parkinsonism essential tremor . Accurate differentiation important treatment prognosis varies different syndrome . At present SPECT scan use mostly . However SPECT use minority patient suspect PD mainly cost discussion sensitivity specificity diagnose PD . We currently finish meta-analysis diagnostic value SPECT patient parkinsonian disease . Recently alternative method visualise alteration cerebral dopaminergic pathway PD patient propose : TCD substantia nigra brainstem . This technique high inter-observer reliability . Becker discover 1994 patient PD bilateral hyperechogenicity substantia nigra . Neuropathological study confirm increase echogenicity iron deposition . However reason increase level iron unknown . Several publication confirm observation 90 % PD patient increase echogenicity substantia nigra . In healthy subject patient essential tremor hyperintensity substantia nigra find 10 % . However 60 % healthy subject increase echogenicity also decrease nigra-striatal function ( 18 ) -F-dopa-PET . So TCD might possibly early ( presymptomatic ) marker PD . If substantia nigra scan combine scan nucleus lentiformis , differentiation PD APS increase . Another advantage technique raphe nucleus make visible . Several study confirm echogenicity raphe nucleus decrease PD patient depression . Our experience suggest positive predictive value technique nears SPECT scan . In pilot study 45 patient PD APS underwent SPECT TCS find positive prediction value 95 % . This would predict , TCE compatible PD , SPECT provide additional information ; theory one might reduce amount SPECT 's almost 50 % case . A direct compare diagnostic accuracy PD duplex SPECT scan make . Our hypothesis TCD substantia nigra duplex scan accurate diagnostic tool deserves place diagnostic work-up PD/Parkinsonism patient diagnostically efficient enough replace 50 % SPECT scan . In comparison SPECT duplex scan less costly ( respectively 80 euro 400 euro SPECT ) comfortable patient . Methods : Subjects : 250 consecutive patient new parkinsonian complaint out-patient clinic university hospital ( Maastricht ) local hospital . Study design : The investigator give clinical diagnosis first visit . All subject undergo SPECT duplex scanning , test judge blindly clinical diagnosis . After two year follow-up , patient see investigator clinical diagnosis make ( investigator blind result duplex SPECT ) . At end follow-up sensitivity specificity first clinical judgement , duplex SPECT calculate . The golden standard clinical diagnosis end follow-up .</detailed_description>
