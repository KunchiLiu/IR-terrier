	<detailed_description>Congenital heart defect common type birth defect ; year , 30,000 baby United States bear kind abnormality . Conotruncal heart defect , consider serious type defect , involve structural abnormality chamber heart blood vessel lead heart . Infants born conotruncal defect must undergo complex open heart surgery , high fatality rate . Folic acid supplementation pregnancy show reduce risk conotruncal defect . However , woman take folic acid pregnancy still give birth infant conotruncal defect . Specific gene may influence way individual metabolize folic acid , variation gene may make infant prone develop heart defect . This study examine relationship gene , maternal nutritional intake , conotruncal heart defect . The result study may help determine genetic nutritional cause congenital heart defect . This study use previously collect data 550 infant born conotruncal defect 1060 infant bear without heart defect . There study visit specifically study . Infant DNA analyze gene may play role folate metabolic pathway . Blood previously collect mother pregnancy analyzed difference nutrient intake . Specifically , level folic acid , choline , vitamin B12 , methionine examine .</detailed_description>
