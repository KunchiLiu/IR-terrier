	<brief_summary>The investigator believe T cell , cell part immune system , cause neurological problem also attack tumor cell . This protocol study clinical status patient paraneoplastic neurological disorder ( PND ) well blood understand relationship neurological disease , cancer , immune system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Study Immune Cell ( T Cell ) Activity Patients With Paraneoplastic Neurologic Syndromes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients paraneoplastic neurological disorder ( PNDs ) provide unique model study tumor immunity neuronal autoimmunity . We hypothesize T lymphocyte autoimmune dysfunction involve pathogenesis paraneoplastic neurological syndrome , killer T cell involve target successful kill tumor cell cancer patient . Furthermore , postulate activity may provide model autoimmune brain disease . We assess immune response PND patient , correlate clinical data ( time course disease , symptoms sign , disability ) , collect archive clinical data , serum cell PND patient current future study basic immune system phenomenon present PND patient .</detailed_description>
