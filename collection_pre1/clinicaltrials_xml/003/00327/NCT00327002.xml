	<brief_summary>Agents increase HDL-C via reverse cholesterol transport could provide new therapeutic option prevention atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease . The investigator propose investigate effect LY518674 component may likely affect atherogenesis patient metabolic syndrome include HDL-C metabolism reverse cholesterol transport pathway , inflammatory response , oxidative stress human subject . As agonist nuclear peroxisome proliferator activate receptor ( PPAR ) alpha , LY518674 may affect transcription gene encode various protein involve atherogenesis . This study explore consequence alter transcription change messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) protein level well protein activity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Mechanistic Study Effects LY518674 High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ( HDL-C ) Metabolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Objectives I . Primary Objective : - To determine effect LY518674 Apo A-I production rate ( calculate fractional synthetic rate fractional catabolic rate ) subject metabolic syndrome low HDL-C. II . Secondary Objectives : - To determine effect LY518674 marker reverse cholesterol transport analyze change serum cholesterol efflux capacity ( vitro cell-based assay ) . - To determine effect LY518674 activity lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase ( LCAT ) , cholesterol ester transfer protein ( CETP ) , lipoprotein lipase , hepatic lipase , endothelial lipase . - To determine effect LY518674 plasma lipid , lipid subfractions , free fatty acid , free fatty acid metabolite , beta-OH butyrate . - To determine effect LY518674 high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) , low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) low-density lipoprotein ( VLDL ) particle size use nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) . - To determine effect LY518674 Apo A-II Apo B-100 kinetics . - To determine effect LY518674 hsCRP . - To determine safety tolerability LY518674 Study Design : Study H8D-MC-EMBG single site , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , parallel study . A minimum 40 subject low HDL cholesterol metabolic syndrome randomize receive double-blind administration LY518674 100 mcg/day placebo 8 week . There safety visit every 2 week treatment initiate , result 7 visit 10 week . There 2 inpatient visit zero eight week .</detailed_description>
