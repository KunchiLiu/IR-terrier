	<brief_summary>The hypothesis existence causal association systemic infectious/inflammatory burden represent periodontitis endothelial function assess flow mediate dilatation brachial artery ( FMD ) subject propose investigation . The objective randomized control clinical trial evaluate effect periodontal therapy endothelial function assess Flow mediate dilatation ( FMD ) . The rationale project twofold : - Establish extent acute systemic inflammation endothelial dysfunction associate delivery subgingival instrumentation treatment chronic periodontitis - Establish whether improved control chronic periodontal infection result improve endothelial function thus existence causal association periodontitis endothelial dysfunction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In last decade considerable evidence support hypothesis chronic low-grade infection , periodontitis include , inflammatory response associate may play significant role onset atherosclerosis . An inflammatory alteration normal endothelial activity think one mechanism may link infection atherosclerosis . It consist loss normal vasodilation , antiplatelet antithrombotic property vascular wall frequently call endothelial dysfunction . Impaired endothelium-dependent dilatation , early functional marker endothelial dysfunction demonstrate young population family history cardiovascular disease . In past 15 year new non invasive reproducible technique call Flow mediate dilatation ( FMD ) use assess endothelial function . Periodontitis chronic infection tooth support apparatus cause primarily anaerobic gram negative bacteria organise biofilm ( commonly know sub-gingival dental plaque ) ; lead inflammatory destruction periodontal ligament alveolar bone eventually tooth exfoliation . Periodontitis highly prevalent industrialise develop country 10-15 % adult population affect severe form disease . Recognized risk factor include genetic polymorphism inflammatory gene , environmental exposure cigarette smoking , systemic disease diabetes . Local periodontal production prostaglandins pro-inflammatory cytokine associate activation matrix metalloproteinases eventually destruction periodontal ligament alveolar bone . It primary cause tooth loss adult population lead long term disability increase treatment need . Local periodontal infection associate systemic response characterize increase serum level C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , hyper-fibrinogenemia , moderate leukocytosis , well increase serum level IL-1 IL-6 compare unaffected control population . Several epidemiological study associate increased level acute phase marker high risk cardiovascular atherosclerotic event . Among marker , C-reactive protein consider one sensitive probably independent risk factor atherosclerosis . It produce liver presumably adaptive defensive reason response variety inflammatory stimulus , include chronic low grade infection . In recently complete pilot trial able establish treatment periodontal infection result significant decrease serum CRP . In study , treatment periodontal infection lead significant decrease serum CRP ( 0.5 mg/L , 95 % CI 0.4 0.7 mg/L ) IL6 otherwise healthy individual affect severe , generalize periodontitis indicate periodontitis contribute systemic inflammatory response . The treatment associate decrease systemic inflammatory marker observe study support hypothesis periodontal infection , along chronic low grade infection body district , contribute inflammatory burden individual may play contributory etiologic role atherosclerosis . It remain establish whether observed improvement serum CRP impact functional vascular parameter endothelial function/dysfunction . The relationship periodontal treatment change serum CRP likely bimodal : increase associate delivery standard subgingival instrumentation associate bacteremia tissue damage expect shortly treatment deliver . Preliminary trial group aim establishment pattern CRP change first day follow delivery periodontal therapy . The data indicate serum CRP level sharply increase treatment value tend return baseline level one week . This bimodal pattern change serum CRP level important since previous investigation establish link functional vascular parameter flow mediate dilatation ( FMD ) serum marker systemic inflammation CRP . Periodontal therapy therefore may lead initial improve FMD parameter subject periodontitis contributes systemic inflammation atherosclerosis . The hypothesis existence causal association systemic infectious/inflammatory burden represent periodontitis endothelial function assess FMD subject propose investigation . Compare effect intensive periodontal treatment regimen community base periodontal care approach term change : - Flow mediate dilatation brachial artery ( primary outcome ) - Acute phase response serum ( CRP , IL-6 , fibrinogen ) - Clinical periodontal parameter : PI , BoP , PPD ( CAL ) - Presence periodontal pathogen periodontal pocket treatment - Patient perception adverse event associate treatment experience This randomize control clinical trial . Its design parallel arm , single blind ; outcomes evaluate 6 month period include approximately 120 subject . Two intervention compare : test treatment intensive regimen periodontal therapy consist oral hygiene instruction subgingival debridement deliver two appointment 24 hour period ; control treatment consist community base periodontal care approach consist supragingival removal deposit deliver two appointment 24 hour period . The control group receive intensive regimen upon completion study upon evidence periodontitis progress . Subjects moderate severe periodontitis recruit among refer care Periodontal Clinic Eastman Dental Hospital . The primary outcome measure study change Flow Mediated Dilatation ( FMD ) brachial artery . Secondary outcome include change serum CRP plasma fibrinogen . Periodontal , microbiological subjective outcome evaluate control outcomes . The primary secondary outcome variable evaluate treatment 1 day , 7 day , 2 month 6 month follow completion treatment . Subjects randomized treatment stratify smoking status study registrar . Treatment allocation conceal study personnel use opaque envelope examiner make treatment record unavailable . All laboratory FMD analysis perform unrelated study personnel blind respect treatment allocation stage progression trial . Intent treat analysis perform statistician blind respect treatment allocation .</detailed_description>
