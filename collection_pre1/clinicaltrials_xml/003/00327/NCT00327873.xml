	<brief_title>Palliative Oxygen Relief Breathlessness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When medical management relieve intractable breathlessness , palliative oxygen often prescribe regardless whether person meet common oxygen funding criterion severely low blood oxygen level . The result study inform best practice care people advance life-limiting illness intractable breathlessness , aid development rational funding guideline , answer international debate role palliative oxygen . This study definitive international multi-center randomize double-blind control trial oxygen versus medical air relief breathlessness participant intractable dyspnea PaO2 &gt; 55mmHg ( measure blood oxygen level ) . Specific aim include demonstration effectiveness oxygen versus medical air relieve breathlessness palliative setting ( Specific Aim 1 ) improve QOL ( Specific Aim 2 ) . Additionally , seek establish patient derive great benefit ( Specific Aim 3 ) , risk therapy ( Specific Aim 4 ) , cost therapy ( Specific Aim 5 ) . The primary hypothesis oxygen therapy superior air relieve sensation breathlessness patient intractable dyspnea due life-limiting illness set PaO2 &gt; 55mmHg . All participant enrol outpatient . The `` eligibility visit '' occur 5-7 day start study include review consent form , short interview , physical exam , blood test . The visit occur home clinic . The blood test include regular venipuncture also arterial blood gas , study do precede month . The `` randomization visit '' occur 2 day study start ( Day -2 ) include short interview quality life ( QOL ) questionnaire ; visit usually do home also occur clinic . The oxygen air concentrators deliver home Day 0 train person oxygen company . On day also brief home visit study nurse include short interview QOL questionnaire . The participant us oxygen medical air gas 7 day ( Days 0-6 ) least 15 hour day . While use oxygen/air participant fill short diary form morning evening , within 30 minute wake retire . The diary focus breathlessness , participant feeling , potential side effect gas . The study nurse conduct `` check-in '' telephone call Day 3 make sure participant OK. On last day ( Day 6 ) nurse visit home conduct brief interview short QOL questionnaire . The oxygen company pick concentrator , usually Day 7 .</detailed_description>
