	<brief_title>Effectiveness Nigella Sativa ( Kalonji ) Seed Dyslipidemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Pakistan develop country limit resource high prevalence dyslipidemia . - Nigella sativa small plant originate Middle East find abundantly , grow wild Egypt , Asiatic Turkey Balkan States . - The seed extract plant use herbalist treatment several medical disorder include dyslipidemia . OBJECTIVE : To determine effectiveness nigella sativa seed control dyslipidemia adult . This pilot study . METHODOLOGY DESIGN Double blind , randomize , control trial Inclusion Criteria : - Adult ( 18 year old ) men woman serum cholesterol &gt; 180 mgs/ dl - Who consent participate Exclusion Criteria : - Patients know Diabetes Mellitus Primary Endpoint The primary end point trial serum LDL cholesterol concentration measure six week intervention . Secondary Endpoint - Serum total cholesterol concentration measure six week intervention - Serum concentration HDL cholesterol measure six week intervention - Serum concentration Triglyceride measure six week intervention - Serum concentration Blood sugar measure six week intervention - Changes Serum Transminase Serum Creatinine six week intervention Intervention Group Recommended - Dietary change - Lifestyle change - Nigella sativa seed intervention . Intervention detail : - Quantity : Two capsule crush nigella sativa seed 500 mg - Frequency : Twice daily - Timing : After meal - Duration : Six week Control Group Recommended - Dietary change - Lifestyle change - Capsules contain Calcium Lactate Dietary Advice Study subject receive advice Principal Investigator ( PI ) - Eat low fat , low cholesterol food - Cut high fat food ( fatty meat bakery good ) - Use low fat cooking method ( Use nonstick pan , barbecue , roast , boil ) - Avoid alcohol consumption - Eat fruit , vegetable whole grain - Subjects group give standard low cholesterol diet sheet well Exercise Subjects group advise take brisk 30 minute walk 5 day week empty stomach one hour meal . LABORATORY INVESTIGATIONS For lab investigation venous blood specimen collect follow test . The test perform 12 hour fasting sample assess primary secondary outcome . - Total Cholesterol - Low Density Lipoprotein ( LDL ) - High Density Lipoprotein ( HDL ) Other investigation - Triglycerides - Fasting blood glucose ( FBS ) - Creatinine SGPT ( ALT ) IDENTIFICATION OF STUDY SUBJECTS Study subject identify executive family medicine clinic within AKUH . Individuals fulfil inclusion criterion inform study ask participate . INFORMED CONSENT - The participant inform possible expect benefit possible harm ensue study - Written inform consent obtain study subject address ethical concern relevant authority RANDOMIZATION - A randomized controlled design use trial - Randomization do give equal chance eligible subject assign either group . - A randomization plan block size four use assign subject intervention control group - This do order achieve equal number participant group - A Co-Investigator create subject identification number assign group accord randomization . FOLLOW-UP &amp; DATA COLLECTION - Baseline data include information height , weight , blood pressure , blood sugar fasting , serum cholesterol , HDL , LDL , triglycerides serum creatinine collect prior start intervention - Subjects study group telephone , interval 10 day study assistant ensure patient compliance - At end six week period , fast blood sample take study subject measure total cholesterol , LDL HDL concentration , serum triglyceride , blood sugar fast serum creatinine . - A food diary combining group food similar nutrient content dietary use give study subject - Participants record daily food intake initially end trial period - Patients ' Body Mass Index ( BMI ) , waist hip ratio blood pressure record baseline end study . ETHICAL ISSUES : - Subjects group study give standard dietary advice , recommend National Cholesterol Education Program ( NCEP ) case fit inclusion criterion propose study . - In study conduct previously , nigella sativa seed show demonstrate protective effect nephrotoxicity hepatotoxicity induce either disease chemical . - However , case adverse event observe , intervention nigella sativa stop particular individual . SAMPLE SIZE CONSIDERATIONS This pilot study include 80 patient . Half get N. Sativa seed capsule rest get calcium lactate placebo capsule . Analysis - In descriptive statistic , comparison two treatment group would do variable age gender . The result mention frequency percentage . - In univariate analysis t-test apply detect significant difference primary outcome two group . - For multivariate analysis , linear regression analysis use identify variable associate primary outcome ( LDL concentration ) , control confound factor . A similar process adopt secondary outcome variable i.e. , serum total cholesterol concentration HDL . SITE Aga Khan University Hospital ( AKUH ) , Karachi</detailed_description>
