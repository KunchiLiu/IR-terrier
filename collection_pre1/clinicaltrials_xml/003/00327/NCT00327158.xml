	<brief_title>A Prospective Study Determine Effectiveness Reaming Reducing Fat Emboli Lungs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reamed intramedullary nailing diaphyseal femur fracture remain standard care treatment fracture . Pressurization femoral canal ream lead extra vasations fat emboli systemic circulation , result deposition fat droplet pulmonary vasculature . This phenomenon well document use Transesophageal Echocardiography . A novel reaming system recently become available may limit phenomenon . The new reamer system incorporate irrigation aspiration reaming , theoretically minimize pressurization fat embolus . Additionally , reamer system allow one pas reaming compare current system require multiple ream pass . The objective study determine effectiveness ream diminish fat emboli lung evidence decreased number large fat droplet enter right heart measure transesophageal echocardiography ream process . This determine benefit aspiration ream would expect . During ream process transesophageal echo cardiogram perform analyze presence absence emboli mean regard total time embolic grade present interval across patient group</detailed_description>
