	<brief_summary>This study examine blood pressure lung control healthy people , people HIV people HIV pulmonary artery hypertension ( high blood pressure lung , also call PAH ) . PAH sometimes develop people HIV , know occurs best treat . Healthy volunteer patient HIV infection 18 year age old may eligible study . All candidate screen medical history , physical examination , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , chest x-ray , echocardiogram blood test . Participants undergo follow procedure : All participant right heart catheterization forearm blood flow study . - Catheterization study . A catheter ( plastic tube ) place arm vein possibly artery arm . Then large catheter pass vein groin , neck chest . Through `` introducer '' catheter , another catheter advance right side heart pulmonary artery . A facemask put place measure amount nitric oxide produce lung . Acetylcholine infuse catheter effect blood pressure lungs amount nitric oxide exhale measure . After 1 hour , catheter facemask remove new catheter insert introducer catheter pulmonary artery . The subject move MRI scanner blood flow measure infusion three different medication : acetylcholine ( cause blood vessel expand slow heart rate ) ; sodium nitroprusside ( cause blood vessel expand increase blood flow heart ) ; L-NMMA ( decrease blood flow block production nitric oxide cell line blood vessel ) . - Blood flow study . Small tube inserted artery patient 's forearm . These use infuse medicine draw blood sample . Forearm blood flow measure use pressure cuff place wrist upper arm , strain gauge ( rubber band device ) place around forearm . When cuff inflate , blood flow arm , stretch strain gauge , flow measurement record . A small lamp position hand measure light reflect hand blood flow forearm . Blood sample draw measure blood count proteins natural body chemical . Then , forearm blood flow measure administration small dose sodium nitroprusside , acetylcholine L-NMMA . There 20- 30-minute rest period injection different drug . In addition , HIV-infected patient PAH undergo follow test determine cause PAH : CT scan lung , pulmonary function test , 6-minute walk test , quality-of-life assessment , assessment difficulty breathing , exercise test measure oxygen breathe carbon dioxide breathe , blood test , monitor oxygen saturation sleep 1 night ventilation/perfusion scan . For ventilation/perfusion scan , subject breathes small amount radioactive aerosol image obtain radioactivity enters lung , picture lung take multiple angle . Next , patient receives injection tiny particle albumin ( protein ) contain small amount radioactivity picture lung take show pattern blood flow lung . Patients HIV PAH may benefit investigational drug , sildenafil ( commonly know Viagra ) , may continue participate next stage study . They receive first dose sildenafil complete forearm blood flow study . They continue drug 16 week , return clinic 1 week first dose every week monitor response treatment drug side effect . At end 16 week , patient return clinic repeat evaluation , include blood test , 6-minute walk test , echocardiogram , right heart catheterization forearm blood flow study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HIV infection associate increase prevalence pulmonary hypertension . In addition , recent data suggest state endothelial dysfunction develop HIV disease secondary anti-retroviral therapy associate dyslipidemia secondary direct viral infection endothelium . This lead premature atherosclerosis possibly contribute avascular necrosis hip . Similar effect pulmonary vasculature may involve development pulmonary vasculopathy . In study plan invasively characterize status pulmonary systemic endothelial function determine mechanism pulmonary vascular endothelial dysfunction HIV disease . To end catheterize healthy volunteer volunteer HIV infection without pulmonary hypertension directly measure acetylcholine-dependent blood flow pulmonary brachial artery ass pulmonary systemic endothelium-dependent blood flow . Simultaneous measurement exhale NO pulmonary capillary artery NO2 - allow complete characterization contribution NO production endothelium-dependent vasomotor control . We also use recently develop MRI technique measure pulmonary artery blood flow infusion acetylcholine ( ACH ) , sodium nitroprusside ( SNP ) NG monomethyl-L-arginine ( LNMMA ) establish responsiveness endothelium dependent vasodilator , endothelium-independent vasodilator NO inhibitor , respectively . Volunteers pulmonary hypertension option undergo open label phase I/II treatment sildenafil 16 week return repeat assessment pulmonary hemodynamics well pulmonary systemic endothelial function . Endothelial cell isolate use novel flow-cytometry methodology develop last two year NIH intramural division utilize combination positive negative selection base specific surface marker activate T cell endothelial cell marker cell viability . Endothelial cell subsequently interrogate use amplified real time PCR methodology affymetrix base gene expression profile developed laboratory . The level expression endothelial cell HIV virus , HHV8 , eNOS , caveolin , HO-1 , endothelin receptor A B , endothelin 1 , addition protein regulate vascular homeostasis cellular host defense ( i.e . epidermal growth factor , transform growth factor beta , platelet derive growth factor interleukin-6 ) , assess . These study provide insight mechanism pulmonary artery endothelial dysfunction suggest rationally design therapy target viral load , HHV8 , and/or NO/endothelin pathway . These study promise open door study pulmonary artery endothelial dysfunction physiological , cellular molecular level .</detailed_description>
