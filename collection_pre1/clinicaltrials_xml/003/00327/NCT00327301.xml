	<brief_summary>Glaucoma worldwide lead cause blindness . The key feature ocular neuropathy characterize excavate optic nerve head . Loss retinal ganglion cell final end point blinding disease optic nerve glaucoma . It known neuronal cell death glaucoma occur apoptotic mechanism . In early study investigator could demonstrate process apoptosis reflect circulate leukocyte different parameter , like differential mRNA expression increase fragmentation DNA . Such alteration point relationship cellular stress apoptotic event . Based result mRNA-expression investigator also expect alteration protein level . This study , therefore , design characterize proteome related protein involve cell death relate pathway . Thus , expression pattern several protein leukocytes patient primary open angle glaucoma analyze technique like Western-blot tandem mass spectrometry . These sample compare sample healthy control . In addition , also compare sample patient Parkinson 's disease . Since glaucoma neurodegenerative disease , patient include positive control study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : Differences proteome concern cell death pathway glaucoma patient correspond difference mRNA expression patient . Specific aim : Characterization cellular proteome human leukocytes glaucoma patient compare healthy control patient Parkinson 's disease . Background : Glaucoma worldwide lead cause blindness . The key feature ocular neuropathy characterize excavate optic nerve head . Loss retinal ganglion cell final end point blinding disease optic nerve glaucoma . It known neuronal cell death glaucoma occur apoptotic mechanism . In early study could demonstrate cell death reflect circulate leukocyte different parameter , like differential mRNA expression , increase fragmentation DNA . The difference mRNA expression indicate close relationship cellular stress condition apoptotic event : increase mRNA expression detect p53 , 20S proteasome alpha subunit , ABC1 transporter , p21 ( WAF1/CIP1 ) , 14-3-3 sigma factor , MMP-9 MMP-14 , TIMP-1 . Based assumption glaucoma patient may differ level expression mRNAs , expect similar difference exist protein level . This study , therefore , design characterize proteome related protein involve cell death relate pathway .</detailed_description>
