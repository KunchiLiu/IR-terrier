	<brief_summary>Blood donor low fingerstick hemoglobin level usually defer donate . A possible solution problem repeat deferral might Blood Banks offer donor low hemoglobin level oral iron supplement . To determine feasibility program , study : - Determine frequency iron deficiency first-time repeat blood donor - Examine effect long-term blood donation donor hemoglobin level iron store - Compare body iron store donor low hemoglobin value donor acceptable hemoglobin value time donation - Determine condition iron deficiency lead low hemoglobin level blood donor - Determine safety effectiveness give oral iron tablet donor low hemoglobin level - Monitor effect oral iron administration donor satisfaction donor retention . First-time repeat blood donor NIH Clinical Center Blood Bank 18 year age old may eligible study . Participants include prospective donor acceptable hemoglobin value time donation whose hemoglobin level determine low donation . All participant follow : - Answer medical question diet , health , family history blood disorder . - Have blood sample draw arm testing blood cell count , iron store , hemoglobin-related test appropriate . Donors low hemoglobin also : - Take iron supplement ( ferrous sulfate ) replenish iron store . ( Donors previously unpleasant side effect ferrous sulfate offer ferrous gluconate alternative . ) - Undergo evaluation medical screen laboratory test time future blood donation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Iron essential element lose blood donation . In order donor compensate iron lose donate blood , iron mobilize body 's iron store absorption iron diet increase . However , balance often difficult maintain premenopausal woman regular blood donor since ongoing blood loss . Deficiency iron result reduce hemoglobin value , iron store , eventually iron deficiency anemia treat . Iron deficiency present problem blood center since minimum allowable hemoglobin blood donation 12.5 g per dL . In Department Transfusion Medicine NIH , 14.6 % donor present whole blood donation 7.7 % donor present apheresis platelet donation defer least one occasion per year due low hemoglobin value . Overall , 7.9 % visit whole blood donation 2.1 % visit apheresis platelet donation result donor deferral due low hemoglobin . Although challenge iron depletion blood donor population know decade , little undertaken resolve issue . Several author report data successful short term project demonstrate safety efficacy iron replacement donor , large long term study report . The objective protocol : ( 1 ) quantitate prevalence iron deficiency first-time presumably healthy individual present blood donation ; ( 2 ) study effect long-term blood donation donor ' hemoglobin level iron store ; ( 3 ) evaluate safety , practicality , efficacy distribute oral replacement iron blood donor ; ( 4 ) determine effect oral iron replacement therapy donor pool monitor deferral rate low hemoglobin initiation iron replacement program . The goal objectives treat prevent iron deficiency prospective regular blood donor , thereby expand eligible donor pool lead increase donor satisfaction retention decrease deferral rate due low hemoglobin .</detailed_description>
