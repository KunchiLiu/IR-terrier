	<detailed_description>Malaria remain one devastate infectious disease , cause high morbidity mortality especially sub-Saharan Africa . The need accurate , simple , inexpensive method diagnose malaria become increasingly urgent . Rapid diagnostic test ( RDTs ) , base detection Plasmodium antigens , may represent practical diagnostic tool traditional light microscopy . This longitudinal study 's objective ( 1 ) evaluate clinical performance ( sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value ) RDTs , compare presumptive diagnosis microscopy , diagnosis malaria child Kampala , Uganda , ( 2 ) identify host test factor lead false positive false negative RDT result comparison polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) analysis . Study subject RDT study already enrol large on-going longitudinal study antimalarial drug efficacy , tolerability , safety begin Kampala study site late 2004 . In RDT study , one-year period , study participant ' blood sample evaluate current gold standard malaria diagnosis ( microscopy ) well two type RDT whenever present new fever episode ( first fever study enrollment , fever occur 14 day patient 's recently diagnose episode malaria ) . As part on-going longitudinal drug efficacy trial , probability sample use select random sample 600 child , follow three year health-care need . The RDT study involve evaluation cohort 12 month , begin approximately third quarter 2005 . This protocol substudy 04-068 .</detailed_description>
