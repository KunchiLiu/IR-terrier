	<brief_summary>Glaucoma worldwide lead cause blindness . The key feature ocular neuropathy characterize excavate optic nerve head . Loss retinal ganglion cell final end point blinding disease optic nerve glaucoma . It known neuronal cell death glaucoma occur apoptotic mechanism . In early study , investigator demonstrate process apoptosis reflect circulate leukocyte different parameter , like differential messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) expression increase fragmentation deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) . Such alteration point relationship cellular stress apoptotic event . Based result mRNA-expression , investigator also expect alteration protein level . This study , therefore , design characterize proteome related protein involve cell death relate pathway . Thus expression pattern several protein leukocytes patient primary open angle glaucoma analyze technique like Western-blot tandem mass spectrometry . These sample compare healthy control . In addition , also compare sample patient Parkinson 's disease . Since glaucoma neurodegenerative disease , patient include positive control study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : Subjects pseudoexfoliation syndrome combination glaucoma may alter activity plasma matrix-metalloproteinase activity high degree DNA fragmentation leukocyte . Specific aim : Determination level plasma matrix-metalloproteinase activity degree DNA fragmentation leukocytes patient pseudoexfoliation syndrome glaucoma ( PEX ) comparison patient primary open angle glaucoma ( POAG ) . Background : One main pathogenic factor development glaucoma increase intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , lead direct indirect damage nerve fiber area optic disk . The raise IOP base increase outflow resistance trabecular meshwork due excessive accumulation extracellular material juxtacanalicular tissue meshwork eye primary open-angle glaucoma ( POAG ) , impaired turnover trabecular meshwork matrix , paramount importance regulation maintenance aqueous humor outflow . Pseudoexfoliation ( PEX ) syndrome systemic disorder extracellular matrix , represent common identifiable cause open-angle glaucoma . There increase evidence suggest PEX syndrome may type fibrosis associate excessive synthesis deposition abnormal elastic fibrillar material many intra- extraocular tissue . Active involvement trabecular meshwork abnormal matrix process lead progressive accumulation PEX material juxtacanalicular tissue consider primary cause chronic pressure elevation eye PEX syndrome . However , mechanism responsible aberrant matrix process remain unknown . Excessive production accumulation abnormal matrix component may due increase de-novo synthesis , decrease turnover matrix component , . Extracellular matrix turnover mediate matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) , large family endopeptidases variable substrate spectrum , presence describe human aqueous humor . The activity enzymes regulate part specific endogenous inhibitor , tissue inhibitor metalloproteinases ( TIMPs ) . Dysregulated expression MMPs TIMPs implicate many disease process accompany abnormal matrix production , fibrotic disorder , variety disease state . In eye , abnormal expression MMPs implicate , among many disorder , glaucoma , proliferative vitreoretinopathy , secondary cataract formation , pathogenesis pterygium . Therefore , MMPs TIMPs likely candidate involve abnormal extracellular matrix metabolism characteristic PEX syndrome/glaucoma ( PEXG ) POAG . PEX seem independent risk factor glaucoma . Possibly , may due altered perfusion . So , PEX syndrome represent common identifiable cause open-angle glaucoma , also risk factor cardiovascular disease . PEX syndrome iris trans-illumination defect see patient transient ischemic attack . At microcirculatory level , ischemia/reperfusion ( I/R ) injury think initiate chemotactic accumulation circulate leukocyte , activation interaction endothelium postcapillary venule . In addition , oxygen free radical think play pivotal role pathogenesis I/R injury . A variety experimental model ischemic injury show free radical induce post-ischemic oxidative damage DNA . Although several human study reveal oxygen radical generate mechanism like irradiation , data exist demonstrate influence reperfusion-associated oxygen radical DNA human . We hypothesize pathogenic process PEX may reflect leukocyte . Depending result glaucoma patient differ level mRNA expression various MMPs peripheral leukocyte PEX syndrome often see transient ischemic attack , assume difference activity MMPs plasma well change DNA stability peripheral leukocytes patient PEX glaucoma . This study , therefore , design analyze activity gelatinases ( MMP-2 -9 ) plasma degree DNA fragmentation peripheral leukocytes patient PEX syndrome PEXG compare POAG control .</detailed_description>
