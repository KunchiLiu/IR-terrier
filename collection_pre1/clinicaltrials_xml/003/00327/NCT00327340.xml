	<brief_summary>This study patient cancer prostate gland metastasize spread outside prostate part body . Patients already treat drug call docetaxel Taxotere® ( without addition steroid call prednisone ) time recent past . They either respond therapy respond therapy , cancer progressing ( grow large spread area body ) . Custirsen ( OGX-011 ) experimental drug show increase effectiveness chemotherapy several kind tumor , include prostate cancer . Both docetaxel mitoxantrone anticancer activity prostate approve Health Canada Food Drug Administration treatment patient prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Safety Feasibility OGX-011 Combination With 2nd-line Chemotherapy Patients With HRPC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study initiate multicenter , open-label , randomized study , plan enrollment 40 subject . Although two treatment arm include study , comparison arm intend . Subjects metastatic HRPC fail first-line docetaxel therapy require second-line therapy randomly assign treatment OGX-011 combination docetaxel/prednisone ( OGX-011/docetaxel/prednisone ) OGX-011 combination mitoxantrone/prednisone ( OGX-011/mitoxantrone/ prednisone ) . The study randomize assure subject enrol two treatment arm unbiased manner . Based preliminary safety data first 44 subject randomize receive either docetaxel mitoxantrone , protocol amend enroll approximately 20 additional subject would assign docetaxel/prednisone treatment arm investigate safety combination .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age ≥ 18 year 2 . Histologic diagnosis adenocarcinoma prostate . 3 . Metastatic disease chest Xray , bone scan , compute tomography ( CT ) scan . 4 . Failed receive minimum two cycle docetaxel base first line therapy regimen . Failure define disease progression within 6 month discontinue first line docetaxel therapy . Disease progression define one following : Progressive measurable ( target ) disease ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] criterion ) : least 20 % increase sum long diameter measurable lesion ( organ mass lymph node ) small sum observe ( baseline nadir ) appearance one new lesion assess CT scan chest Xray . Bone scan progression : one new lesion bone scan follow docetaxel treatment . Increasing serum PSA level : rise PSA three consecutive measurement obtain least one week apart . If third PSA value less second , additional fourth test confirm rise PSA acceptable . 5 . Baseline laboratory value state : Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Bilirubin ≤ 1.1 x ULN ( unless elevate secondary condition Gilbert 's disease ) SGOT ( AST ) ≤ 1.5 x ULN Castrate serum testosterone level ( &lt; 50 ng/mLor &lt; 1.7 mmol/L ) . 6 . If treat bilateral orchiectomy , patient must willing continue luteinizing hormone release hormone analogue throughout study . 7 . Adequate bone marrow function define absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 10^9 cells/L platelet count ≥ 100 x 10^9/L . 8 . Karnofsky score ≥ 60 9 . Received chemotherapy , radioisotope therapy , strontium 89 , samarium 153 . ( Prior radiotherapy steroid follow first line docetaxel therapy allow . ) 10 . Received one prior biological response modifier therapy follow first line docetaxel therapy . 11 . At least 21 day since complete last dose docetaxel , biological response modifier , and/or radiotherapy . ( Exception radiotherapy : least 7 day since complete single fraction ≤ 800 cGy restrict field . ) 12 . Has recover therapy related toxicity ≤ grade 2 , ( except alopecia anemia . ) 13 . Willing able give inform consent follow protocol requirement . 1 . Life expectancy le 12 week . 2 . Patient beyond 6 month follow last dose docetaxel . 3 . Patient could tolerate dose docetaxel least 45 mg/m² end first line therapy due toxicity . 4 . History current document brain metastasis carcinomatous meningitis , treat untreated . ( Brain image asymptomatic patient require . ) 5 . Current symptomatic cord compression require surgery radiation therapy . ( Once treat , patient eligible study . ) 6 . Active second malignancy ( except non melanomatous skin superficial bladder cancer ) . 7 . Prior radiotherapy &gt; 25 % bone marrow . 8 . Uncontrolled medical condition major active infection , myocardial infarction stroke within 3 month , uncontrolled hypertension , and/or significant concurrent medical illness , , opinion Investigator , would preclude protocol therapy . 9 . History active congestive heart failure . 10 . Known allergy hypersensitivity docetaxel polysorbate 80 ( diluent ) .</criteria>
