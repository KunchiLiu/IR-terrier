	<brief_summary>Congenital heart disease major cause morbidity mortality infant . Many cardiac defect require surgical palliation repair newborn period . The effect chronic hypoxia growth development unclear . Infants severe cardiac defect may undergo surgery infancy , often cardiac surgery provide palliation , correction . As result , infant expose physiology chronic hypoxia neonatal period infancy , critical period growth development . The optimal oxygen saturation infant palliate cardiac defect unknown . The purpose study analyze growth development infant post-surgical palliation infancy ass variation oxygenation saturation hemodynamics relate weight gain , linear growth increase head circumference first three year life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We wish retrospective review clinical data infant undergone surgical palliation follow cardiac defect past five year ( January 1 , 2001 March 31 , 2006 ) : Hypoplastic leave heart syndrome Pulmonary atresia Severe pulmonary stenosis . The patient chart , date 01.01.2001and 03.31.2006 , review Children 's Healthcare Atlanta , Egleston Hospital Sibley Heart Center Cardiology clinic Children 's Healthcare Atlanta . We review approximately 180 chart . We collect follow information patient : Medical Record Number Account number Dates admission , discharge , treatment death , date birth Information regard cardiac sign symptom , medication information Age , weight , diagnose result image study Clinic visit information routine follow appointment weight , length , head circumference , oxygen saturation , vital sign , medication , diet , blood pressure , symptom , blood test , chest x-ray finding , date type procedure Readmissions , feed regimen , cardiac catheterization data , surgical data Parent history developmental milestone , physical therapy speech therapy consultation , feed history , evaluation swallow function Airway symptom Noncardiac procedure noncardiac medical problem Family history social history relate care infant home , complication medical surgical treatment cerebral oximetry .</detailed_description>
