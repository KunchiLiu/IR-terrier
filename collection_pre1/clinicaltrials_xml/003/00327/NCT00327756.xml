	<brief_summary>This study examine whether mitochondrial function impair patient bipolar disorder . Mitrochondria small organelle inside cell responsible energy production . Recent study animal human suggest abnormality mitrochondria may involve bipolar depression . The study also examine whether food supplement Coenzyme Q10 ( CoQ10 ) improve mitochondrial function symptom depress mood , low energy , anxiety slowness think movement bipolar patient . CoQ10 use increase cell energy production antioxidant . It benefit patient Parkinson 's disease migraine prolong survival patient cancer heart failure . Patients 18-65 year age bipolar disorder currently depressive episode least 4 week duration may eligible study . The study four phase , follow : Phase I : Medication Withdrawal Patients taper psychotropic medication , usually 1 2 week . Phase II : Baseline Evaluation After medication 2 week , patient undergo follow procedure : - Magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) . The two procedure perform MRI scanner . Both test use strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image provide information brain anatomy chemistry . - Blood test assess mitochondrial function isolate blood cell . - Skin biopsy test mitochondria . A small sample skin tissue 5 x 5 millimeter surgically remove . Phase III : Administration CoQ10 Placebo Participants randomly assign take either CoQ10 placebo ( inactive look-alike substance ) twice day mouth . While take study medication , patient follow procedure periodically : - Rating scale anxiety depression adverse event . - Check vital sign . - Blood urine sample collection . Phase IV : Study Completion At end 8 week treatment , patient physical examination electrocardiogram , procedures phase II repeat . Participants may receive short-term treatment ( 12 week ) medication bipolar depression , follow refer community physician long-term treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bipolar affective disorder common , severe , chronic often life-threatening illness . The depressive phase contribute majority morbidity mortality illness . Impairments physical social function result depression often severe chronic medical illness . Few treatment use result understanding pathophysiology bipolar disorder . Undoubtedly , great understand pathophysiology bipolar disorder lead improve treatment . Current theory depression suggest mood disorder associate impairment cellular resilience structural plasticity possibly result abnormal cellular energy metabolism . Studies Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( MRS ) bipolar subject show reduce brain intracellular pH reduce ATP . Cellular energy generate mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation glucose via electron transport chain store ATP , provide neuron glia energy require maintain function . Mitochondrial dysfunction inability compensate increase ATP demand might lead impaired cellular resilience believe involved pathophysiology bipolar disorder . Abnormal regulation nuclear gene cod mitochondrial protein hippocampus bipolar subject provide evidence mitochondrial dysfunction bipolar disorder . Coenzyme Q10 ( CoQ10 ) essential cofactor mitochondrial electron transport chain necessary cellular energy generation . Exogenous administration CoQ10 attenuate ATP depletion anti-oxidant property . In light evidence , hypothesize bipolar disorder associate mitochondrial dysfunction evidence impaired brain energy metabolism administration CoQ10 , mitochondrial enhancer , restore mitochondrial function . To accomplish objective , compare mitochondrial function bipolar depressed subject 26 healthy control match age , gender BMI . Measures mitochondrial function include brain lactate level ( product anaerobic glycolysis ) H+ MRS , 2 ) assay mitochondrial function culture fibroblast platelet , 3 ) gene expression mitochondrial nuclear gene use cDNA Microarray . Further , subject bipolar depression , age 18 65 randomize either CoQ10 ( 300-1200 mg/day ) placebo double-blind placebo control trial period 8 week . Measures mitochondrial function compare subject randomize placebo CoQ10 baseline end 8-week trial .</detailed_description>
