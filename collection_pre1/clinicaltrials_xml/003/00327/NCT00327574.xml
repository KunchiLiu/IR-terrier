	<brief_summary>Studies establish high blood pressure ( BP ) common risk factor cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Despite heavy burden hypertension ( 33 % person age 45 year ) , reliable data comparative strategy manage hypertension Pakistan . Our Wellcome Trust fund pilot study Karachi , Pakistan 320 adult age 40 year show prevalence hypertension ( 95 % CI ) 40.3 % ( 34.9-45.7 % ) , CVD 32.5 % ( 27.6-37.8 % ) . We conduct study two component : 1 ) cross sectional study determine prevalence CVD , determinant Karachi , Pakistan ; 2 ) prospective , 2x2 factorial design , cluster allocation intervention study evaluate impact ) Population approach household health education ( HHE ) community health worker ( CHW ) BP level population age 5 year low-middle income community Karachi ; ii ) High-Risk approach special BP management administer intensively trained local general practitioner BP level hypertensive subject age &gt; = 40 year population . The cost effective BP control strategy would serve model much-needed national level hypertension control programme Pakistan , possibly develop country South Asia . We hypothesize 1 ) HHE deliver train CHW superior HHE lower BP level population ; 2 ) management hypertension specially trained GPs well usual care provide community Karachi lower blood pressure hypertensive subject .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose study conduct among low middle-income population Karachi . This population likely particularly prone CVD , poor access quality care , often prescribe expensive drug GPs . Screening visit : The Community Health Workers ( CHW ) pay home visit invite subject age 5 year participate survey . The screening would three level : 1 ) Household screen subject age 5 year ( n= 17,850 individual , 3000 household ) . 2 ) Adult screen individual age 40 year ( n= 4200 individual ) . 3 ) Hypertensive adult screen ( n= 1860 individual ) identify hypertension adult screen invite re-measurement BP confirm hypertension . Intervention Effectiveness Study : This 2x2 factorial design , cluster allocation intervention study compare control intervention primary care GP , without health education . The main comparison relate reduction BP ) household member ( age &gt; 5 year ) , b ) hypertensive adult ( age &gt; 40 year ) . Interventions : The sample assign four intervention group : - Group A : Routine care . - Group B : Routine care plus Health Education - Group C : Care provide trained GP - Group D : Care provide trained GP plus Health Education .</detailed_description>
