	<brief_title>Blood Test Ovarian Cancer Associated Antibodies ( CAAb )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>General Information Antibodies specific response `` foreign '' antigen , usually detectable serum within 5-7 day initial exposure . However , case suppression specific immune response , case tumor . To date , report serum antibody associate cancer . Some tumor , surgically remove study find infiltrates T lymphocytes antibody bound tumor cell . These antibody ( specific immune response ) assume form later stage tumor growth , however , even case , serum antibody report ( probably due mostly `` absorbed '' tumor mass ) . Since mutation normal cell lead malignant cell mass involve change structure function cell , could assume immune system recognize change antigenic determinant respond ; , suppression cause tumor would reason lack antibody . If immune suppression could overcome , vitro , could lead formation antibody detectable serum ( call process Cimmunology ) . Identifying structure antibody bind , look correlation tumor pathology antibody ' specificity – could provide additional information tumor – via blood test . Future CAAb Test The Cimmunology base test comprise in-vitro stimulation step antibody detection step . The assay use find Cancer Associated Antibodies ovarian cancer patient . Identification ovarian cancer associate antibody could provide clinician additional immunological antigenic information regard patient 's condition medical status . The Cimmunology process comprise blood collection process step incubation ( special stimulation `` tube '' call CimTube ) period humid , 37oC incubator 5 % CO2 . The test detection specific antibody ELISA base , include different potentially interesting antigen . The relevant medical pathological information , collect patient 's file , enable detailed analysis test result . STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary objective : - To find Cancer Associated Antibodies Effectiveness : - To determine ability Cimmunology process lead vitro antibody production , ability ELISA assay detect antibody , establish relationship ELISA result clinical/pathological status patient . The statistical significance CAAb test result determine . STUDY POPULATIONS AND PATIENT SELECTION Ovarian cancer patient The study population include subject suspect go treated ovarian cancer , prior surgical procedure anti-cancer treatment . The clinical suspicion include one following : Pelvic mass ( pelvic examination image technique ) , high CA-125 level post menopausal woman , ascites , due incidental finding distant metastasis . Final analysis do relation pathology . Control group The control group include patient , gynecology department ( appropriate care unit ) , prior cancer history . STUDY DESIGN Overall Description The current study comparative observational two-arm study , involve consecutive ovarian cancer patient study duration , age match control subject . The purpose study assess effectiveness CAAb test detect ovarian cancer associate antibody . Subjects screen potential participation study , accord inclusion exclusion criterion . Patients recruit asked sign inform consent form . The data patient include parameter clinical pathological state patient , result CimTube culture step experimental kit . The effectiveness CAAb test assess evaluate statistical significance CAAb test use . The study utilize three step group-sequential design two interim one final analysis use O'Brian-Fleming ' boundary . The data collection may stop first second interim analysis bound reach . This could substantially decrease number patient time study , slightly increase maximum number patient . ( See Sample size consideration ) . We use 1:2 ratio cancer control patient decrease necessary number cancer patient main limiting factor . The sponsor conduct interim analysis , follow first third second third ovarian cancer case sample size recalculate accord obtain estimate mean variance test two group . Since data gather date epithelial cell carcinoma , study also focus epithelial cell carcinoma . Therefore stromal germ cell tumor , comprise le 10 % OC case drop base final pathology analysis . In addition , non ovarian case mistake ovarian carcinoma comprise approximately 10 % woman undergo surgery OC . These also drop base final pathology . Therefore , least 60 patient enrol study , order obtain statistically project need sample size 50 ovarian cancer sample . The control group 120 patient . Study Procedure In hospital : First , identify study patient sign inform consent form , Eligibility Form fill ; bar-coded . Patient demographic clinical information acquire patient ’ medical file , include age , country origin , medical history result test do lead diagnostic evaluation ovarian cancer ( relevant control group ) record appropriate , bar-coded , pre-study case report form . The report either electronic ( dedicate secure internet site ) via hard copy . A hard copy record keep department . The study anonymous Department keep name patient without reveal investigator study sponsor . The Study Sponsor provide tubes barcode label monitoring . The doctor/nurse/phlebotomist collect three heparin vacuum tube ( 20-24 ml ) , label ( bar-code ) , fill initial step `` Sample follow-up form '' ( SFF ) . The tubes blood package double seal container ( provide sponsor ) . The department notify designate shipper collect blood 1 hour time sample . For OC sample two age match control ( +/- 3 year ) recruit . Transportation Hospital Handling Lab : The blood transport room temperature ( 18-250C ) , accord relevant regulation , laboratory . Transportation time 6 hour . Times record SFF . In blood handle laboratory : The blood handle laboratory ( locate 200km collection site ) isolate PBMC ( Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ) put Cimmunology culture within 20 hour sample time ( fill time SFF ) . The detailed protocol Cimmunology medium provide Lab Discoveries participate laboratory ( applicable ) . All hospital Israel send blood sample laboratory Lab Discoveries . After culture step , culture fluid collect frozen -80 , properly label aliquot . The frozen sample send diagnostic laboratory antibody test . In diagnostic laboratory : Antibody test , ELISA , prepare use different antigen . The sample test response two antigen identify past , additional new one . All data permanently record directly dedicate computer . For sample antibody result put coded patient file . The result analyze statistician expertise cancer population study . At Hospital , post surgery : 2-3 week surgery , CRO collect patient 's file result pathology lab relevant information nature state tumor remove surgery . These result record dedicated secure internet site print bar-coded CRF-OC keep Department . STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS The present study comparative observational two-arm study , involve consecutive ovarian cancer patient study duration , age match control subject . The main purpose study assess effectiveness CAAb test . This effectiveness measure Fisher ' distance ( often call “ effect size ” ) define = |m1-m2|/2 Where m1 mean value test control , m2 mean value ovarian cancer patient , |m1-m2| denotes absolute value difference ( m1-m2 ) , common estimate standard deviation distribution test one group ( control ovarian cancer ) . Statistical Hypothesis Null Hypothesis : There relationship presence absence OC CAAb i.e . d=0 Alternative Hypothesis : The expectation CAAb cancer population differs control population , i.e . m1 equal m2 . Since sign difference important , test two-sided . General Considerations According previous result , assume 1 . The distribution test result group close Normal may transform Normal log-transformation . 2 . The variance distribution two group approximately equal 3 . Having mind pilot study consider result significant two-sided p-value 0.1 less . The bound 0.1 instead 0.05 chosen decrease chance random exclusion potentially informative test . When decide continuation study correction multiple comparison assume . However , result present without correction use FDR Benjamini &amp; Hochberg approach ( Benjamini , Hochberg 1995 ) . Where confidence limit appropriate , confidence level 95 % . Sample Size The sample size calculate use relevant information previous study Peptides P3 P1 ovarian cancer . There information literature regard cancer associate antibody . The sample size calculate three step sequential group design two side significance 0.1 0.05 , power 0.8 , cancer : control ratio 1:2 , D 0.5 . The calculation use standard formula sample size necessary comparison mean value two independent group t-test . The correction group-sequential procedure O ’ Bien Fleming ’ test increase number 1.017 1.027 significance value 0.05 0.1 , negligible sample size . ( see C. Jennison , B.W.Turnbill Group Sequential Methods Applications Clinical Trials Chapmann &amp; Hall ( 2000 ) Boca Raton FL US pp30 table 2.4 ) . The calculation do use NCSS-PASS software . Endpoint Evaluation Effectiveness Analysis A calculate D 0.3 0.5 mark test non effective use alone . However , may important combination test part multivariate test procedure . Tests &lt; 0.3 consider non-effective . A test , combination test , &gt; 0.5 mark CAAb test effective .</detailed_description>
