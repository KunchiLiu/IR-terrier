	<brief_summary>Failure thrive difficulty gain weight sign uncompensated congestive heart failure ( CHF ) . Infants Trisomy 21 complete atrioventricular canal defect ( CAVC ) frequently develop uncompensated CHF weight gain failure pre-operatively . A weight 5 kg suggest optimal timing CAVC repair . A delay surgical repair often occur weight gain stall reach plateau prior reach 5 kg . A retrospective review perform Kogon , et al , child undergo surgery VSD CHOA Egleston recently report age weight surgery may , however , associated adverse surgical outcome . The purpose study determine optimal time surgical correction CAVC Trisomy 21 infant base reach plateau fail weight gain despite maximal anti-congestive nutritional therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A retrospective chart review 100 infant Trisomy 21 CAVC operate CHOA Egleston January 1 , 2001 March 24 , 2006 perform . Graphs birth weight rate weight gain time plotted patient group whole . The point reach plateau weight gain decide patient indexed birth weight . Medical management detail , i.e . medication dietary information ( caloric density formula , route administration ) . This medical management indexed function weight gain chart . Medical complication ( respiratory infection , gastroenteritis , hospitalization , additional non-cardiac medication ) likewise plot segment accord position relative weight gain plateau . Age eventual surgery whether surgical date delay complication note . Surgical cardiopulmonary bypass time morbidity mortality note . Postoperative length ventilator support , length stay CICU total length stay determine also display function body weight function time plateau weight . Postoperative morbidity mortality three month repair note , include cause hospital re-admissions outpatient medical complication ( respiratory infection , gastroenteritis , need continued medication CHF ) .</detailed_description>
