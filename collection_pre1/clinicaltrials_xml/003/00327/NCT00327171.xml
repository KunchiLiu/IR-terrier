	<brief_summary>This study evaluate outcome participant advance ovarian epithelial adenocarcinoma receive aflibercept . The primary objective compare objective response rate Aflibercept ( ziv-aflibercept , AVE0005 , VEGF trap , ZALTRAPÂ® ) 4.0 mg/kg 2.0 mg/kg , administer intravenously ( IV ) every 2 week historical control participant advance ovarian epithelial ( include fallopian tube primary peritoneal ) adenocarcinoma resistant platinum topotecan and/or liposomal doxorubicin . The secondary objective assess efficacy , safety , pharmacokinetics , potential biological pharmacogenomic marker study drug activity , health-related quality life . This study employ Independent Review Committee ( IRC ) radiological tumor assessment . For tumor assessment-related efficacy variable , two analysis perform : primary analysis base Independent Review Committee ( IRC ) review data secondary analysis base Investigator evaluation . If endpoint evaluate IRC , IRC review data report study .</brief_summary>
