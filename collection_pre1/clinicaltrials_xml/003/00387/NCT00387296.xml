	<brief_summary>The study 's aim determine whether use mechanical device improve timeliness anesthesia provide liposomal lidocaine cream . Liposomal lidocaine cream historically come brandnames ELA-Max LMX , either 4 % 5 % lidocaine cream . In protocol , abbreviation LLC generally use refer 4 % concentration use FAST Lidocaine . Regardless concentration use , encapsulation lidocaine liposome protect anesthetic rapid metabolism allow medication remain epidermis , yield theoretical benefit long-lasting anesthesia.1 The test device painless functional microarray ( FMA ) render hundred microscopic puncture per cm2 patient 's stratum corneum . The hole stratum corneum subsequently allow faster movement LLC skin anesthetize . Currently , topical anesthetic use less commonly Emergency Department ( ED ) would case available approach associate long onset time . The commonly utilized topical anesthetic intact skin , eutectic mixture local anesthetic ( EMLA ) , require least hour anesthetic effect ; maximal effect require 2 hours.2 , 3 4 The topical anesthetic use FAST Lidocaine study , 4 % LLC , roughly equipotent analgesic effect EMLA work faster , must still place least half-hour onset reliable anesthesia.1 , 5-8 Commentators judge delay `` considerable '' write long application time , use topical anesthetic may practical.1 , 8-10 In discuss agent ( LLC ) formulate rapid transcutaneous absorption , ED wind care expert write `` delayed onset limit use emergent setting . `` 11 It also note LLC 's utility potentially diminish fact anesthesia may begin wear soon 10 minute cream removal.8 Given previously outline finding , obvious room improvement ED delivery topical anesthesia . The goal render topical anesthesia practical - thus likely use - constitute basis FAST Lidocaine study . We seek identify whether novel approach safely painlessly improve onset time ( perhaps depth ) topical anesthesia . Reducing pain cause procedure involve violation skin barrier ( e.g . intravenous [ IV ] line placement , anesthesia suture wound ) important goal . Needlesticks IV catheter identify important cause pain child adults.8 , 12 , 13 In term frequency , U.S. EDs place 20 million IV catheter care 10 million wounds.9 Thus , potentially broad-based utility potentiator local anesthesia absorption ED . The importance clinical goal improve absorption topical anesthesia already prompt effort aim improve delivery efficacy topically apply local anesthetic . Previous investigation demonstrate utility - limitation - various method traverse and/or strip stratum corneum . Among technique study use electrical energy ( iontophoresis ) ,14 sound wave ( sonophoresis ) ,15 , 16 adhesive tape17-19 lasers.11 , 12 , 20 , 21 While vary approach promise , limitation leave room assessment new method promise safe , painless , effective . The approach FAST Lidocaine study ass FMA use . The FMA painless mechanism place skin minimal pressure . It create microscopic puncture stratum corneum , facilitate movement anesthetic cutaneous barrier . The device 's physical characteristic , namely easy application low apparent potential incorrect unsafe use , appear quite suitable ED utilization . If work , FMA would immediately useful variety circumstance . The overarch goal FAST Lidocaine investigator assess whether FMA improve management procedure-related pain ED . The main problem term ED use currently available topical anesthetic - whether EMLA , LMX , others - time onset , rather anesthetic efficacy . Thus , time impracticality ED situation spur FAST Lidocaine . The study 's primary focus endpoint time anesthesia . Secondary analysis evaluate whether depth anesthesia improve assess nadir visual analog scale ( VAS ) assessment . However , noteworthy deep anesthesia necessary order establish potential utility FMA acute care set .</brief_summary>
