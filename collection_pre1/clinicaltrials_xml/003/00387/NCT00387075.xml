	<detailed_description>First-degree relative agree participate ( n=3,000 ) ask complete 40-item olfactory identification test provide mail . 300 subject ( 225 decrease odor identification 75 normal olfaction ) invite undergo DAT image Institute Neurodegenerative Disorders New Haven , CT . There also additional clinical follow-up participant 's clinical ( local ) site . The primary outcome measure study mean striatal uptake [ 123I ] B-CIT first-degree relative loss odor identification , compare establish healthy control database ( age 40-70 ; n=50 ) . 300 relative follow longitudinally clinical evaluation second imaging study complete two year . Comparing first second scan subset subject allow u evaluate rate progressive loss dopamine transporter density pre-symptomatic period .</detailed_description>
