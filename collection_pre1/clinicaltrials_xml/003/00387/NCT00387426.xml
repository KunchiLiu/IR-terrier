	<brief_title>Sunitinib Treating Patients With Idiopathic Myelofibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I. Assess response rate duration response patient idiopathic myelofibrosis treat sunitinib malate . SECONDARY OBJECTIVE : I. Assess safety sunitinib malate patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive oral sunitinib malate daily 6 week . Treatment repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Criteria : At least 4 week since prior chemotherapy radiotherapy ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) At least 4 week since prior major surgery At least 7 day since prior concurrent CYP3A4 inhibitor , include azole antifungal ( ketoconazole itraconazole ) , clarithromycin , erythromycin , diltiazem , verapamil , HIV protease inhibitor ( indinavir , saquinavir , ritonavir , atazanavir , nelfinavir ) , delavirdine At least 12 day since prior concurrent CYP3A4 inducer , include rifampin , rifabutin , carbamazepine , phenobarbital , phenytoin , Hypericum perforatum ( St. John 's wort ) , efavirenz , tipranavir No prior antiangiogenic agent ( e.g. , bevacizumab , sorafenib , pazopanib , AZD2171 , vatalanib , VEGF Trap ) No concurrent investigational agent No concurrent anticancer agent therapies No concurrent therapeutic dos coumarinderivative anticoagulant ( e.g. , warfarin ) ( Warfarin = &lt; 2 mg/day prophylaxis thrombosis low molecular weight heparin allow provide INR = &lt; 1.5 ) No concurrent combination antiretroviral therapy HIVpositive patient No concurrent agent proarrhythmic potential ( e.g. , terfenadine , quinidine , procainamide , disopyramide , sotalol , probucol , bepridil , haloperidol , risperidone , indapamide , flecainide ) Diagnosis MF ( histologically confirm ) require therapy , include previously treat relapsed refractory ( one prior standard acute leukemiatype chemotherapy regimen ; limit prior MF direct therapy ) newly diagnose , intermediate high risk accord Lille scoring system ( adverse prognostic factor : Hb &lt; 10 g/dl , WBC &lt; 4 &gt; 30 x 10^9/L ; risk group : 0 = low , 1 = intermediate , 2 = high ) , symptomatic organomegaly . Serum bilirubin level &lt; /= 2x upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Higher level acceptable attribute active hemolysis MF Serum glutamicpyruvic transaminase ( SGPT ) ( alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] ) level &lt; /= 2x ULN . Higher level acceptable attribute MF . Serum creatinine level &lt; /= 2x ULN . Eighteen year age old . ECOG performance status 01 ( Karnofsky &lt; /= 70 % ) . Patients must QTc &lt; 500 msec Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( e.g . hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) duration study participation . All woman childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test prior receive sunitinib . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Both men woman member race ethnic group eligible trial . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior begin treatment recover treatmentlimiting adverse event ( grade 1 good ) due agent administer 4 week earlier . At least 4 week must elapse since major surgery prior study enrollment . Continuous use supportive care medication ( i. e. growth factor , anagrelide , hydroxyurea ) allow . Patients may receive investigational agent . Patients receive prior treatment specific antiangiogenic agent ( e.g. , bevacizumab , sorafenib , pazopanib , AZD2171 , PTK787 , VEGF Trap , etc . ) target VEGF/VEGFR system . Other agent may antiangiogenic effect allow ) . ( i.e . thalidomide ) Patients abnormal QTc prolongation ( define QTc interval equal great 500 msec ) patient history serious ventricular arrhythmia ( VT VF &gt; /= 3 beat row significant ( judged treat physician ) ECG abnormalities.Patients consistently poorly control ( month prior study screen ) hypertension ( systolic blood pressure 140 mmHg high diastolic blood pressure 90 mmHg high ) despite appropriate medical management hypertension . Patients require use therapeutic dos coumarinderivative anticoagulant warfarin . Exceptions include : patient use warfarin 2 mg daily prophylaxis thrombosis , patient use low molecular weight heparin provide patient 's INR &lt; /= 1.5 . Patients condition ( e.g. , gastrointestinal tract disease result inability take oral medication requirement IV alimentation , prior surgical procedure affect absorption , active peptic ulcer disease ) impair ability swallow retain sunitinib tablet . Patients follow condition : ·Serious nonhealing wound , ulcer , bone fracture , history abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intraabdominal abscess within 28 day treatment , ·cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) transient ischemic attack , myocardial infarction , cardiac arrhythmia , stable/unstable angina , symptomatic congestive heart failure , coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft stenting , pulmonary embolism within 12 month prior study , ·Class III IV heart failure define NYHA functional classification system . Because sunitinib metabolize primarily CYP3A4 liver enzyme , eligibility patient take medication potent inducer inhibitor enzyme determine follow review case Principal Investigator . Every effort make switch patient take agent substance medication . Patients preexist thyroid abnormality unable maintain thyroid function normal range medication . Patients uncontrolled intercurrent illness ( judged treat physician ) include , limited , ongoing active infection require IV antibiotic . Pregnant woman exclude study sunitinib antiangiogenic agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother sunitinib , breastfeed discontinue mother treated sunitinib malate . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction sunitinib . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate .</criteria>
