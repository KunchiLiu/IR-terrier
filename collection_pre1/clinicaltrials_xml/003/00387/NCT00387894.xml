	<brief_title>Erlotinib Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme Gliosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine objective response rate patient recurrent epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) -positive PTEN wild-type glioblastoma multiforme gliosarcoma treat erlotinib hydrochloride . Secondary - Assess response rate patient also EGFRVIII mutant PTEN wild type glioblastoma multiforme gliosarcoma . - Determine progression-free survival patient treated drug . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients stratify accord concurrent use enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug ( EIAEDs ) ( yes v ) . Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Some patient may receive additional erlotinib hydrochloride 1 year physician 's discretion . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INclusion Criteria : Diagnosis glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) gliosarcoma ( GS ) In first , second , third relapse History lowgrade glioma transformation GBM GS allow Considered first relapse first document diagnosis GBM GS Measurable evaluable disease contrast MRI Must fail prior treatment include external beam radiotherapy without chemotherapy Epidermal growth Factor Receptorpositive PTEN wildtype immunohistochemistry PATIENT CHARACTERISTICS : Karnofsky performance status 60100 % WBC ≥ 3,000/mm³ Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mm³ Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm³ Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL ( transfusion allow ) SGOT &lt; 2 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) Bilirubin &lt; 2 time ULN Creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL OR creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min Not pregnant nursing Negative pregnancy test Fertile patient must use effective hormonal barrier method contraception , , least 12 week completion study treatment No cancer within past 3 year except nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix No active infection No disease would obscure toxicity dangerously alter study drug metabolism PRIOR CONCURRENT THERAPY : See Disease Characteristics More 4 week since prior concurrent radiotherapy At least 4 week since prior concurrent cytotoxic chemotherapy agent ( e.g. , temozolomide ) ( 6 week nitrosoureas ) At least 2 week since prior concurrent noncytotoxic chemotherapy agent At least 4 week since prior investigational agent No concurrent investigational agent No prior erlotinib hydrochloride epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosinekinase inhibitor At least 2 week since prior enzymeinducing antiepileptic drug ( EIAEDs ) , use concurrently study treatment Concurrent continuous use EIAEDs allow provided patient receive drug ≥ 2 week prior study treatment No concurrent immunotherapy anticancer hormonal therapy No concurrent antineoplastic antitumor agent Patients meet follow criterion ineligible study entry : Patients history cancer ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma insitu cervix ) , unless complete remission therapy disease minimum 3 year ineligible . Patients must active infection Patients must pregnant/breast feeding must agree practice adequate contraception . Women childbearing potential must negative BHCG pregnancy test document within 14 day prior treatment . Patients must pregnant uncertainty study drug may potentially embryotoxic . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ) prior study entry , duration study participation , continue approximately 12 week study complete . If condom use barrier contraceptive , spermicidal agent add ensure pregnancy occur . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Prior treatment Tarceva , EGFR tyrosinekinase inhibitor allow . Patients must disease obscure toxicity dangerously alter drug metabolism .</criteria>
