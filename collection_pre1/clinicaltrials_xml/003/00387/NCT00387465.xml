	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose azacitidine give together entinostat see well work treat patient recurrent advance non-small cell lung cancer . Azacitidine entinostat may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving azacitidine together entinostat may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Azacitidine Entinostat Treating Patients With Recurrent Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety , characterize toxicity , determine maximum tolerate dose 5-AZA ( azacitidine ) fixed-dose entinostat patient recurrent advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . ( Phase I ) II . To determine objective response rate 5-AZA entinostat patient recurrent NSCLC . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pharmacokinetic profile 5-AZA entinostat patient recurrent NSCLC . II . To assess pharmacodynamic effect 5-AZA entinostat deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) methylation , histone acetylation , gene re-expression patient recurrent NSCLC analysis blood , sputum tissue biopsy . III . To explore effect 5-AZA entinostat progression-free overall survival patient recurrent advance non-small cell lung cancer . IV . To explore differing response rate progression-free survival two schedule 5-AZA entinostat patient recurrent advance non-small cell lung cancer . OUTLINE : This multicenter , phase I , dose-escalation study azacitidine follow open-label , phase II study . Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1-6 8-10 entinostat orally ( PO ) day 3 10 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
