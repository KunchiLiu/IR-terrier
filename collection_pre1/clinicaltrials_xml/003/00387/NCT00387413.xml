	<brief_summary>GSK189254 highly potent histamine 3 ( H3 ) receptor antagonist demonstrate efficacy reduction mechanical hyperalgesia allodynia chronic constriction injury pre-clinical model neuropathic pain ( NP ) . The mechanism action GSK 189254 pain model hypothesise via enhanced release monoamine central nervous system ( CNS ) . A similar mechanism action also show duloxetine . In phase I study , safety efficacy GSK189254 investigate electrical hyperalgesia ( EH ) model healthy volunteer build confidence preclinical efficacy demonstrate compound translate patient . This study conduct double-blind , double-dummy , placebo-controlled , incomplete block , two period crossover study . Up 40 healthy male female volunteer , age 18-45 year old , randomise study order achieve 32 evaluable subject . Subjects undergo two 3-week treatment period randomise receive placebo either GSK189254 ( 100Âµg daily ) duloxetine ( 60mg daily ) . There one week washout treatment period . The effect repeat oral dose GSK189254 duloxetine secondary hyperalgesia EH model determine . Subject : GSK189254 , Neuropathic pain ( NP ) , H3 antagonist , duloxetine , Electrical hyperalgesia , Phase I , Healthy volunteer , Double blind , Safety , tolerability .</brief_summary>
