	<brief_title>Exercise Study For People With Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This intervention study determine whether exercise program target spinal extremity range motion individual Parkinson 's Disease , superior general conditioning 'usual care ' . This study build previous finding Schenkman colleague include follow : loss spinal extremity range motion occur sequelae PD ; loss contribute significantly early impairment balance ; spinal range motion balance people economy movement impaired people PD . Specifically , examine whether intervention , target range motion balance , also improve economy movement . Untreated impairment range motion , balance , economy movement may become highly disable . Short term improvement range motion balance occur exercise . If patient sustain improvement supervise exercise program complete , functionally limit impairment may delay . Additionally , exercise spinal range motion couple functional retraining , patient improve overall physical functional ability . Therefore , study establish overall impact target exercise program people PD term balance , economy movement , overall functional ability . The study randomize clinical trial , three treatment arm four repeat measure : treatment , treatment , follow-up 10 month 16 month . This study compare usual care base National Parkinson 's Foundation , aerobic training , target flexibility functional training . The primary outcome measure overall functional ability , balance economy movement . Secondary outcome include measure disease state , spinal range motion , aerobic capacity , quality life .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Community dwelling , independently ambulatory adult mild moderate PD ( Stages 2 , 2.5 , 3 modify Hoehn Yahr scale ) include . For inclusion , study subject must diagnosis PD make attend neurologist use criterion UK Brain Bank ( e.g. , least two cardinal sign PD [ i.e. , bradykinesia , rest tremor , rigidity , postural instability ] ) ; without PD medication know suspected cause parkinsonism . They must stable regimen least one month prior enrollment , must receive optimal medication management judgment examine neurologist . Participants exclude : onstate freezing ; hospitalize within previous three month , score Folstein MiniMental Status Exam le 25 ( indicate significant dementia ) ; nondrug induced psychosis , drug induce hallucination , period &gt; 25 % time ( UPDRS part IV ) [ 3 ] suboptimal therapy Parkinson 's disease motor nonmotor symptom ; second neurological disorder ( e.g . stroke ) result motor involvement , poorly control unstable cardiovascular disease precludes participation exercise program . In addition , participant exclude participate another trial except investigation meet follow criterion : 1 ) PD Trial relate symptom PD ( e.g. , genetics PD ) ; 2 ) stable dose investigational medication give treat motor symptoms Parkinson 's disease openlabel basis 3 ) trial expect affect PD movement ( e.g. , hypertension , diabetes ) . They exclude speak English adequate interpretation participate aspect study . Other exclusion criterion include presence atypical parkinsonism syndrome due drug ( e.g. , metoclopramide , flunarizine ) , metabolic neurogenetic disorder ( e.g. , Wilson 's disease ) , encephalitis , cerebrovascular , degenerative disease ( e.g . progressive supranuclear palsy , multiple system atrophy , vascular parkinsonism ) , history pallidotomy , thalamotomy , deep brain stimulation , fetal tissue transplant . Finally , participant exclude clinically significant medical condition , psychiatric condition , drug alcohol abuse , laboratory abnormality would , judgement investigator , interfere subject 's ability participate study . Additional exclusion : 1 ) exercise limit neuromuscular , joint/bone , cardiovascular , peripheral vascular , cerebrovascular pulmonary disease ; 2 ) abnormal treadmill stress test contraindication testing ( recent MI , CHF , pulmonary embolus , significant aortic stenosis ) ; 3 ) uncontrolled hypertension ; 4 ) unstable diabetes endocrinopathy ; 5 ) active liver disease ( &gt; 3X normal LFTs ) ; 6 ) major psychiatric illness would affect ability understand cooperate fully study protocol ; 7 ) massive obesity ( BMI &gt; 40 ) ; anemia ; 8 ) consistent use alcohol ( &gt; 2 drinks/d ) ; 9 ) involvement ongoing exercise program ( &gt; 2Xwk 20 min intensity could produce sweat ) last 6 month .</criteria>
