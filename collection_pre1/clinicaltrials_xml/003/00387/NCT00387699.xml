	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Others interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin etoposide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving bevacizumab together cisplatin , etoposide , radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give bevacizumab together cisplatin , etoposide , radiation therapy work treat patient limited-stage small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine 1-year progression-free survival patient limited-stage small cell lung cancer treat bevacizumab , cisplatin , etoposide , radiotherapy . Secondary - Determine toxicity regimen patient . - Determine response rate patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive cisplatin IV 30-60 minute bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 etoposide IV 60 minute day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . During course 1 , patient also undergo thoracic radiotherapy twice daily day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 . Patients achieve complete partial response stable disease first 4 course chemotherapy continue receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment bevacizumab repeat every 21 day 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Within 4-6 week blood count recover first 4 course chemotherapy , patient achieve complete partial response also undergo prophylactic cranial irradiation ( PCI ) 10 fraction 3 week . * NOTE : *Bevacizumab give 3 week prior PCI , resume 1 week completion PCI . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 10 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 79 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
