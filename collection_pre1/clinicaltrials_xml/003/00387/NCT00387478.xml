	<criteria>Patients must male female age 18 50 year inclusive . Patients must least twoyear clinical history SAR due birch pollen allergy . Patients must allergy tree pollen allergen , define positive case history positive skin prick test tree pollen allergen ( wheal ≥ 5 mm ( birch ) ≥ 3 mm ( hazel alder ) great negative control skin prick test ) Visit 1 . Patients skin test Visit 1 must adhere washout time antihistamine . Specific IgE birch tree pollen document radioallergosorbent test ( RAST ) , equivalent test , class ≥ 2 . Patients must obtain minimum qualifying symptom score final two pretreatment birch pollen exposure session ( Visits 4 5 ) enrol study . Minimum qualify symptom score define TSS least 12 possible 24 NSS least 7 possible 12 least one symptom diary card Visits 4 5 . Furthermore , minimum priming criterion NSS 7 possible 12 , include score least 2 runny nose , two diary card Visits 4 5 , must obtain . Patients must observe drug washout time prior Screening ( Visit 1 ) . The use medication permit expect interfere ability patient participate study provide stable regimen ( i.e. , dosage administration ) six week prior Screening . Males nonpregnant , nonlactating female postmenopausal naturally surgically sterile ( hysterectomy ; bilateral oophorectomy ; bilateral tubal ligation surgery least 6 week prior study initiation ) . Postmenopausal define least 12 month natural spontaneous amenorrhea , least six week follow surgical menopause ( bilateral oophorectomy ) . Females childbearing potential use one follow acceptable birth control method : Intrauterine device ( IUD ) place least 3 month ; Barrier method ( condom diaphragm ) spermicide ; Stable hormonal contraceptive least 3 month prior study study completion ; Abstinence ; Nonheterosexual lifestyle . Patients normally active otherwise judge good health basis medical history , physical examination routine laboratory test . Patients must willing able give write informed consent must provide consent . Patients must willing able attend require study visit . 11.Patients must able follow instruction . A patient include study one follow criterion apply : Have positive skin prick test [ wheal ( long diameter ) ≥ 3 mm great negative control ] Visit 1 follow perennial allergen : house dust mite ( Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus Dermatophagoides farinae ) , mold ( Cladosporium cladosporioides , Alternaria alternata , Penicillium chyrsogenum ( notatum ) , Aspergillus fumigatus ) , epithelium ( cat , dog , horse ) . In case , careful history take moderate severe symptom report exposed aforementioned allergen , subject exclude . Exception : source allergen ( cat , dog , horse ) avoid entire study . Subjects mild symptom expose aforementioned allergen 3 year prior Visit 1 allow enroll . Mild symptom define : sign/symptom clearly present , minimal awareness , easily tolerate . Concurrent disease might complicate interfere investigation evaluation study medication skin prick test result , : Rhinitis medicamentosa ; Large obstructive nasal polyp ; Documented evidence acute significant chronic sinusitis , upper respiratory tract infection determine individual Investigator ; Asthma , exception mild intermittent asthma , lessen confound asthma medication ; History hospitalization asthma ; History presence acute subacute atopic dermatitis , chronic dermatitis , urticaria factitia , urticaria due physical/chemical influence . Current diagnosis seasonal asthma cause tree pollen exposure . Concurrent use inadequate washout prohibit medication . Chronic intermittent use inhale , nasal , ocular , oral , intramuscular , intravenous , potent superpotent topical corticosteroid ( assessed Investigator ) . Chronic use long act antihistamine concomitant medication ( e.g. , tricyclic antidepressant ) would affect assessment effectiveness study drug ( ) . Are pregnant lactate . Any systemic disorder could interfere evaluation study medication ( ) . Upper low respiratory infection require antibiotic within 14 day Visit 2 . Diagnosis sinusitis within 30 day Visit 2 . Any ocular disorder ( allergic conjunctivitis ) include presume infectious ocular disease ( bacterial , fungal , viral , etc . ) , could interfere evaluation study medication . Hypersensitivity study drug ( ) excipients . Patients active quiescent tuberculous infection respiratory tract , untreated local systemic fungal bacterial systemic viral infection parasitic ocular herpes simplex . Patients experience nasal septal ulcer , nasal surgery nasal trauma within 90 day enrollment study . Clinical history anaphylaxis idiopathic anaphylaxis . Patients clinical history immunodeficiency , include immunosuppressant therapy . Patients autoimmune disease ( e.g . liver , kidney , thyroid , nervous system ) Patients history angioedema Patients tyrosine metabolism disturb , especially case tyrosinemia alkaptonuria . Patients contraindication adrenaline . Patients take βblockers , include eye drop , indication . Patients take Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Current diagnosis chickenpox measles . Clinical history drug alcohol abuse would , Investigator 's discretion , interfere patient 's participation study . Clinical history severe uncontrolled cardiovascular , pulmonary , hepatic , renal and/or disease/illness could expect interfere study . Clinical history , evidence , nasolacrimal drainage system malfunction . Study site staff immediate relative study site staff individual would access clinical study protocol . Patient receive TreeMATAMPL previous clinical trial . History immunotherapy tree pollen extract , except treatment successfully complete 3 year prior Visit 1 SAR symptom reappear prior Visit 1 . Patient receive treatment preparation contain MPL past 12 month . Participation investigational study within 30 day Visit 1 concomitantly study .</criteria>
