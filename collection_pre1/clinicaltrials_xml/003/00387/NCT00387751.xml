	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give bevacizumab together sorafenib work treat patient unresectable stage III stage IV malignant melanoma . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Sorafenib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Bevacizumab sorafenib may also stop growth melanoma block blood flow tumor . Giving bevacizumab together sorafenib may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab Sorafenib Treating Patients With Unresectable Stage III Stage IV Malignant Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine clinical biologic activity sorafenib tosylate bevacizumab , define sum complete response , partial response , prolong stable disease â‰¥ 16 week , patient unresectable stage III stage IV malignant melanoma previously treat least 2 regimen immunotherapy , cytokine , biologic therapy , vaccine therapy previously untreated patient appropriate candidate receive aldesleukin-based treatment . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate safety tolerability sorafenib tosylate bevacizumab patient . II . Evaluate biologic activity regimen , term time progression , progression-free survival 6 month , overall survival , patient . III . Describe significant pharmacokinetic interaction bevacizumab sorafenib tosylate . IV . Characterize pharmacodynamic relationship plasma concentration sorafenib tosylate bevacizumab effect treatment normal organ function tumor tissue patient . V. Identify predictive biomarkers response regimen patient . VI . Correlate change biological measurement patient outcomes . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute day 1 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence unacceptable toxicity disease progression . Blood sample tumor biopsy obtain periodically pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic study . Samples examine liquid chromatography , mass spectrometry , immunohistochemistry , gene expression analysis , DNA mutation analysis , genomic analysis biological marker . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
