	<detailed_description>This research study prospective , randomize , single-blinded , control , clinical trial principal investigator , Hollis King , DO , PhD University North Texas - Health Science Center , Texas College Osteopathic Medicine . The purpose study determine effectiveness osteopathic manipulative treatment ( OMT ) adjunctive modality standard medical care reduction post-operative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) . This first attempt study treatment PONV utilizing OMM ; study conduct pilot study The hypothesis study OMT combine standard-of-care prophylactic anti-emetic therapy patient follow administration inhalational anesthesia , comparison control group receive standard-of-care anti-emetic prophylaxis reduction incidence severity PONV . Two aim guide study toward evaluation hypothesis : AIM I : To demonstrate effect OMT standard care number episodes emesis experienced post-operatively subject undergone anesthesia utilize inhalational anesthesia ( alone combination intravenous anesthetic ) . All subject receive treatment `` no-treat '' protocol randomize . Data collect prior discharge post-anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) enumerate episode emesis experience study subject . Subjects ask complete Ambulatory Surgery-Rhodes Index Nausea , Vomiting , Retching ( AS-RINVR ) 24-48 hour follow surgery post-study questionnaire completed.1 AIM II : To demonstrate effect OMT standard care intensity nausea experience post-operatively subject undergone anesthesia utilize inhalational anesthesia ( alone combination intravenous anesthetic ) . Following subject 's completion treatment protocol ( `` no-treat '' randomize ) , nausea visual analog scale ( VAS ) validate Boogaerts employ 30 minute , 1 hour , 24-36 hour follow post-operative , post-anesthesia treatment protocol . Results compare control experimental group difference . Osteopathic manipulative medicine ( OMM ) OMT seek , general , facilitate optimal often faster return health homeostasis . Though individual largely seek OMT alleviation structural musculoskeletal complaint , use speculate discovered effect also physiologic mechanism . Osteopathic manipulative treatment maneuver head , neck , upper thoracic spine may impart postulated mechanism PONV.3 Successful treatment measure reduction PONV , evaluate several outcome measure , group subject receive post-operative OMT along standard-of-care treatment control group receive standard-of-care treatment PONV . Successful completion specific aim validate hypothesis study also establish study 's effect feasibility future study . Additionally , pilot study establish statistical trend need establish effect size data need power analysis sample size estimate future study .</detailed_description>
