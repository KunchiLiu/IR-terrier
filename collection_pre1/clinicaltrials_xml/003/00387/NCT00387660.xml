	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give irinotecan together carboplatin work treat patient metastatic recurrent small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan Carboplatin Treating Patients With Metastatic Recurrent Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine response rate patient metastatic recurrent small cell lung cancer treat irinotecan hydrochloride carboplatin . - Determine median survival patient treat regimen . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior chemotherapy ( yes v ) disease stage ( metastatic v relapse ) . Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV 90 minute carboplatin IV 15-30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 80 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
