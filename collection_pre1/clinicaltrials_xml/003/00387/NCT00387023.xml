	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : 1 . To evaluate efficacy Zevalin treatment low-grade follicular Non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma orbit mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue ( MALT ) conjunctiva use radiographic imaging , clinical examination ( slit lamp biomicroscopy external examination conjunctiva ) , external photography whenever possible . 2 . To establish safety profile patient population use clinical examination include slit lamp biomicroscopy , evaluation tear film Schirmer 's test . 3 . To establish dosimetry Zevalin orbit first 3 patient agree undergo dosimetry .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radioimmunotherapy With 90Y Zevalin Orbital Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rituximab Zevalin monoclonal antibody bind lymphoma cell cause cell death . As case patient orbital lymphoma , orbital biopsy must perform confirm diagnosis status orbital lymphoma . The study doctor must first make sure disease spread much severe enough require immediate treatment chemotherapy begin treatment study . You 4 teaspoon blood drawn . Women able child must negative blood urine pregnancy test . You receive two injection rituximab vein 4 6 hour . This follow infusion Zevalin 30 minute day . Whole body image perform immediately 4-6 , 24 , 72 , 144 hour receive Zevalin . About 1 week later , receive second infusion rituximab Zevalin . You may take study orbital lymphoma respond within three month receive rituximab Zevalin . Researchers measure response therapy use magnetic Resonance imaging ( MRI ) orbit evaluation eye clinic . If take study , give option receive external beam radiation therapy treatment disease . Follow-up evaluation do every 3 month 2 year every 6 month Years 3 4 . This test consider standard care would include medical history , physical exam , blood test , urine test . The status disease evaluate use CT scan MRI orbit every 3 month first year every 6 month Years 2 , 3 , 4 . Blood test ( 4 teaspoon ) every 3 month first year may continue every 3 6 month become negative start another anti-cancer therapy . This investigational study . Zevalin rituximab FDA approve use together study investigational . A total 12 patient take part study . All enrol The University Texas ( UT ) MD Anderson Cancer Center .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Biopsyproven diagnosis lowgrade NonHodgkin 's follicular lymphoma orbit MALT conjunctiva/orbit . The orbit/conjunctiva primary predominant site involvement previous history systemic involvement , orbit/conjunctiva site new recurrence . 2 . No anticancer therapy three week ( six week Rituximab , nitrosourea Mitomycin C ) prior study initiation , fully recover toxicity associate prior surgery , radiation treatment , chemotherapy , immunotherapy 3 . An Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve sign inform consent 4 . Age &gt; 18 year . This justified since lowgrade nonHodgkin 's lymphoma orbit extremely rare nonexistent pediatric population 5 . Expected survival &gt; 3 month 6 . Prestudy performance status 0 , 1 , 2 accord WHO 7 . Acceptable hematologic status within two week prior patient registration , include : ) Absolute neutrophil count ( [ segment neutrophil + band ] x total WBC ) &gt; 1500/mm3 b ) Total lymphocyte count &lt; 5,000/mm3 patient small lymphocytic lymphoma ( IWFA ) c ) Platelet count &gt; 150,000/mm3 , patient receive dose 0.4 mCi/kg Zevalin ) Platelet count 100,00/mm3 149,000/mm3 , patient receive 0.3mCi/kg dose Zevalin 8 . Female patient pregnant lactate 9 . Men woman reproductive potential following accept birth control method ( determine treat physician , however abstinence acceptable method ) 10 . Patients previously Phase II drug eligible longterm toxicity expect , patient drug eight week significant post treatment toxicity observe 11 . Patients determine less 25 % bone marrow involvement lymphoma within six week registration ( base bone marrow biopsy ) . ( This criterion must strictly meet adequate patient safety . ) 1 . Patients impair bone marrow reserve , indicate one following : ) Prior myeloablative therapy autologous bone marrow transplantation ( ABMT ) peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) rescue b ) Platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3 c ) Hypocellular bone marrow ( le 15 % cellularity ) ) Marked reduction bone marrow precursor one cell line ( granulocytic , megakaryocytic , erythroid ) 2 . Prior radioimmunotherapy 3 . Presence central nervous system ( CNS ) lymphoma 4 . Patients HIV AIDSrelated lymphoma 5 . Patients small lymphocytic lymphoma ( IWF A ) total lymphocyte count &gt; 5,000/mm3 6 . Patients pleural effusion 7 . Patients abnormal liver function : total bilirubin &gt; 2.0 mg/dL 8 . Patients abnormal renal function : serum creatinine &gt; 2.0 mg/dL 9 . Patients receive prior external beam radiation therapy &gt; 25 % active bone marrow ( involved field regional ) 10 . Patients receive Granulocyte colonystimulating factor ( GCSF GMCSF ) therapy within two week prior treatment 11 . Serious nonmalignant disease infection , opinion investigator and/or sponsor , would compromise protocol objective 12 . Major surgery , diagnostic surgery , within four week</criteria>
