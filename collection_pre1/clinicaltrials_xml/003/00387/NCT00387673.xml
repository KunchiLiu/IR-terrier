	<brief_summary>Electrical stimulation ( pulse electricity apply skin wrist ) activity-based hand exercise show improve motor skill strength individual stroke recently show also effect individual spinal cord injury . Therefore , purpose research study investigate whether electrical stimulation alone electrical stimulation follow activity-based training produce gain pinch strength ( hard squeeze thumb pointer finger together ) upper extremity function ( well arm hand perform activity ) individual spinal cord injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Prolonged Electrical Stimulation Neural Plasticity Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal cord injury ( SCI ) affect 10,000 individual per year United States . Approximately one half individual SCI tetraparesis due cervical injury . Impaired hand function significantly limit ability individual cervical SCI perform manual activity daily live affect individual physically , psychologically socially . Preliminary research investigator suggest somatosensory stimulation combine activity-based training improves hand function strength individual incomplete cervical SCI . Further investigation novel technique warrant due need establish proven effective rehabilitation technique promote recovery function individual SCI . The purpose research study : 1 ) determine somatosensory stimulation form prolong , peripheral nerve electrical stimulation enhance effect upper extremity activity-based training program individual incomplete cervical SCI , , 2 ) identify operative neural mechanism underlie change induce application somatosensory stimulation . The hypothesis study individual incomplete cervical SCI : 1. 6-week period somatosensory stimulation hand , either alone combine activity-based training , produce improvement behavioral outcome significantly great produce activity-based training precede sham stimulation period 2. behavioral improvement associate great change cortical excitation observe subject receive activity-based training precede sham stimulation period . The specific objective study : 1 . Recruit male female volunteer spastic paresis due incomplete SCI impair hand function , randomize subject 1 3 group , receive 6 week upper extremity train 3 sessions/week , follow : ) somatosensory stimulation median , ulnar radial nerve level wrist ( 2 hours/session ) ; SS group b ) somatosensory stimulation median , ulnar radial nerve wrist ( 2 hours/session ) follow activity-based upper extremity training program ( 1 hour/session ) ; SS+ABT group c ) sham somatosensory stimulation median , ulnar radial nerve wrist ( 2 hours/session ) follow activity-based upper extremity training program ( 1 hour/session ) ; ABT group carry train 3 subject group simultaneously , group consist 2 subject time , 2 set subjects/year 2-year period , yield target sample 36 subject . 2 . Conduct pre-and post-training assessment behavioral outcome use Wolf Motor Function Test Jebsen Taylor Hand Function test measure upper extremity function , hand-held dynamometry measure pinch grip strength , Semmes-Weinstein Monofilament Testing measure sensory function . 3 . Conduct pre-and post-training assessment supraspinal motor recruitment , include motor evoke potential ( MEP ) amplitudes response transcranial magnetic stimulation extent duration cortical silent period response transcranial magnetic stimulation ; spinal motoneuron excitability measure F-wave amplitude persistence .</detailed_description>
