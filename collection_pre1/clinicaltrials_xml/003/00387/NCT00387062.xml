	<brief_title>Computer-Based Training Patients With Post-Chemotherapy Cognitive Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer common malignancy woman United States , estimate 211,240 new case invasive breast cancer diagnose among woman , 1,700 diagnose men , 2005 . While cure rate improve significantly , chemotherapy breast cancer associate number negative side effect . One deficit cognitive function , condition commonly refer `` chemobrain '' . While debate cognitive decline result chemotherapy still ongoing , clear evidence cognitive decline woman breast cancer post-chemotherapy . Cognitive decline often report affect memory , attention , executive function information processing speed . Studies suggest incidence `` chemobrain '' range 17 % - 75 % woman undergone chemotherapy.This cognitive impairment affect quality life impact patient ' ability concentrate , make decision fulfill family , career , community responsibility . Although uncertainty mechanism lead cognitive decline , press need identify intervention alleviate symptom help breast cancer survivor recover cognitive functioning resume roles activity pre-cancer level . Brain plasticity refers brain 's capacity physical functional change ; capacity explain experience induces learn throughout life . On basis grow body literature field psychophysics , neurology , neuropsychology , brain plasticity , hypothesize brain processing machinery refine , elaborate , strengthen rigorous training learning . The purpose study investigate training improve cognitive functioning . We hypothesize continuous active interaction environment demand sensory , cognitive , motor system , together imbed reward successful performance help improve memory cognitive functioning patient suffer `` chemobrain '' .</detailed_description>
