	<detailed_description>Background : Stroke lead cause disability United States . Biological change hemiparetic skeletal muscle may propagate disability . The investigator report gross muscular atrophy major shift fast myosin heavy chain ( MHC ) isoform distribution hemiparetic thigh relate reduced fitness slow walk speed . The investigator also find elevated inflammatory mediator , TNFa NFkB paretic thigh muscle . No prior study systematically examine profile hemiparetic muscle contractile proteins relationship function fitness stroke . Furthermore , molecular mechanism underlie hemiparetic skeletal muscle atrophy contractile protein abnormalities unknown . The investigator investigate treadmill aerobic exercise ( T-AEX ) , task-oriented training model . This exercise model reverse alteration MHC profile hemiparetic leg muscle stroke . This T-AEX program also improve fitness level , leg strength , ambulatory performance chronic stroke . Moreover , post hoc analyse randomize treadmill exercise program show specific feature exercise prescription likely influence nature exercise-mediated adaptation . Specifically , The investigator find degree training velocity progression predict gain VO2 peak , walk function . In contrast , increase train duration associate improved 6-minute walking function , fitness gain . These finding provide initial evidence cardiovascular metabolic adaptation contingent upon advance training velocity , rather train duration . These exercise-mediated change MHC profile inflammation might extremely important context muscle structure function , ambulation overall fitness . Hypothesis : The investigator propose randomize clinical study investigate hypothesis chronic stroke patient 6 month velocity-based progressive T-AEX program superior duration-based progressive T-AEX improve HP leg skeletal muscle contractile protein expression reduce inflammatory marker improve muscle function , fitness , ambulation . Specific Aims : 1 ) Determine whether skeletal muscle MHC isoform expression alter inflammatory mediator , TNF marker NFkB activation , present hemiparetic vastus lateralis muscle , compare non-paretic leg match non-stroke control leg muscle , related muscle function , fitness , gait performance . 2 ) Determine whether 6 month progressive T-AEX program attenuate abnormal MHC profile inflammatory mediator improve muscle structure function . Methods : At baseline , bilateral VL biopsy obtain chronically disabled , stroke participant hemiparetic gait examine HP non-P thigh skeletal muscle alteration MHC isoforms , key muscle contractile protein , evidence inflammation ( TNFa ) NFkB activation . Participants randomize 6 month progressive velocity-based duration-based T-AEX training . Repeat VL muscle biopsy obtain HP limb exercise intervention ass whether 6-month exercise rehabilitation restore MHC profile attenuate activation inflammatory pathway . Expression specific MHC isoforms , TNF , NFKB marker expression ( mRNA protein ) investigate muscle tissue real-time RT-PCR , Western Blot analysis , immunohistochemistry . The investigator explore relationship T-AEX mediate change MHC expression inflammatory activation skeletal muscle stroke improve muscle strength , muscle performance , fitness activity level , ADL performance , gait deficit severity . Anticipated Results Relevance : The cross-sectional baseline data provide first systematic study substantial cohort stroke patient define relationship altered structural contractile protein expression muscle physiology clinical measure muscle performance , metabolic fitness , rehabilitation mobility outcomes . HP VL muscle directly compare non-P limb muscle within -subjects non-stroke reference control , order well understand scope skeletal muscle inflammatory metabolic abnormality stroke population . The intervention result allow u determine specific requirement treadmill train optimal crucial produce exercise-mediated adaptation hemiparetic skeletal muscle lead improve rehabilitation outcome reduce disability chronic stroke .</detailed_description>
