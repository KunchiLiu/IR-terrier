	<brief_summary>Family history early atherosclerotic disease first-degree relative [ ( FDR ) sibling , parent child ] important risk factor coronary artery and/or vascular disease . The risk increase ~ 2 - 7 time general population . Increased thickness intima medium carotid arterial wall , increased rate plaque formation independent predictor cardiovascular disease . Also show increased level calcium deposition arterial wall also associate increased level coronary artery narrowing . We assess occurrence severity abnormalities intima medium thickness ( IMT ) and/or plaque formation increase calcium deposition coronary artery relation well know traditional risk factor ( plasma glucose , smoking , BMI , waist circumference , blood pressure , total cholesterol , low density lipoprotein , total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein ratio ) non-traditional risk factor ( C-reactive protein , Lpa , homocysteine ) FDRs index patient early onset heart vascular disease appropriate control population . Also determine factor ass IMT Ca score well . This may help reduce cost investigation , identify population high risk develop cardiovascular disease , may help physicians treat early cardiovascular complication occur . Also may help reduce cost invasive test , hospital admission medical cost overall reduce morbidity mortality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : ( ) To identify difference `` intervention '' `` usual care '' group Framingham risk score , anthropometrical , biochemical parameter baseline 24 month compliance prescribe regimen . Prevalence maternal paternal risk factor , DNA/mRNA profile risk factor may also examine . ( ii ) To assess relation CIMT psychosocial status conventional cardiovascular risk factor serum level inflammatory marker `` intervention '' versus `` usual care '' group 2 year follow . ( iii ) Subjects score high emerge risk factor IMT score undergo CAC scanning . This allow u correlate value CAC score FDR 's patient premature atherosclerosis IMT score biochemical marker already capture study . Method : ( ) Index patient premature atherosclerosis ( angina ECG change , myocardial infarction , Coronary artery bypass grafting , Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty , Peripheral vascular disease , Cerebro vascular disorder ) men age 50yrs woman age 60yrs time mentioned adverse event identify cardiac cath lab , healthy heart program St.Paul 's VGH , ward St. Paul 's hospital , heart function transplant clinic also Cardiologists ' office , ask participate study . Those volunteer participate assess classical emerge cardiovascular risk factor ask permission approach FDRs . The family index patient randomize use block randomization method ( block 4 ) usual care intervention group . After recruitment patient , recruitment first degree relative undertaken . If present hospital visiting hour , relative approach person study coordinator participation study . Alternatively , relative contact letter participation , follow telephone call . FDRs spouses undergo comprehensive risk factor assessment include dietary , smoking , drink exercise habit . Data past medical history , family history treatment history collect . Anthropometric measurement ( height , weight , waist circumference ) , blood pressure , heart rate lipidemia marker record . Blood sample collect biochemical measurement , include total cholesterol , low-density lipoprotein cholesterol , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol , triglyceride , Apoprotein-B A1 , lipoprotein ( ) , homocysteine , C-reactive protein glucose . Blood store future genetic analysis . Risk future event estimate accord Framingham procam risk score . The procedure repeat begin end 2-year period . The participant divide `` intervention '' `` usual care '' group . The intervention group receive risk assessment summary , copy family physician . Recommendations treatment modifiable risk factor target ( blood pressure control , lipid , glucose , smoke cessation ) counseling carry . Regular follow study participant 3 6 month make patient call phone 4 8 month lifestyle counsel participant reassess 2 year . The usual care group receive initial risk assessment summary along diet , exercise risk assessment use questionnaire . The risk assessment summary mail patient family physician note highlight abnormal result ask discuss . The procedure repeat end 2-year period . The comparison intervention usual care group make 24 month initial assessment health risk factor profile . ( ii ) Those participant older 30 yr &gt; 10 % risk score volunteer participate FACT phase 2 study ask sign consent IMT study give psychosocial questionnaire complete ask bring back time IMT visit . IMT measure experienced technician use HP Pointrex ultrasound scanner . This take 45 minute . The data analyse experienced sonographer stored offline future use . A second scan perform two year later . ( iii ) Subjects already enrol study underwent IMT scan baseline visit select candidate procedure . Patients meet criterion select form `` intervention '' `` usual care '' group ; contact mail/phone ask participate portion study . If , agree , patient give new consent form sign consent do , appointment CAC scan make . The subject ask abstain caffeine caffeine-containing product day scan order ensure optimal rest heart beat &lt; 80bpm . No preparation necessary procedure . The total length appointment 30 minute , time required place ECG patch properly position subject . The actual scan take 20 second . The technician ask patient hold breath approximately 20 second scan perform . The CAC scan administer trained technician Canada Diagnostic Centre locate 136-55 West 12th Avenue Vancouver , BC . Except small amount radiation patient exposed procedure know risk associated scan .</detailed_description>
