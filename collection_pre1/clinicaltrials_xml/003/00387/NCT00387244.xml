	<brief_title>Efficacy Spinal Cord Stimulation System Salvage Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic pain manage sequential application various strategy : medication , anesthetic injection , ablation , surgery , implantable intraspinal infusion pump , spinal cord stimulation . For significant number patient , however , treatment inadequate tolerate . Those patient require another option pain relief . The therapy afford spinal cord stimulators dependent overlap paresthesia painful area . One lead reason explant SCS system ( include device failure surgical complication ) complaint inadequate pain relief due poor coverage painful area . Mounting evidence suggest clinical efficacy afford SCS varies manufacturer 's technology . For instance , previously-implanted SCS patient report complete coverage , good pain relief , pleasant sensation associate paresthesia Precision system . The tight lead space current fractionalization achievable Precision system may provide pain relief failure another SCS system . This study assess pain relief Precision system patient chronic , intractable pain refractory treatment type SCS system and/or implantable intraspinal infusion pump . Because Precision allow unique program combination possible system , expect subject enjoy significant pain relief .</detailed_description>
