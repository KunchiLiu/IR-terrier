	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Everolimus may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Giving temozolomide together everolimus may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose everolimus give together temozolomide treat patient newly diagnose , recurrent , progressive malignant glioblastoma multiforme .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide Everolimus Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed , Recurrent , Progressive Malignant Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine maximum tolerate dose ( ) recommend phase II dose ( ) everolimus administer standard-dose temozolomide patient newly diagnose , recurrent , progressive glioblastoma multiforme . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . Secondary - Determine efficacy regimen patient measurable disease baseline . - Identify correlate activity molecular study paraffin-embedded tumor sample patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics regimen patient . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , nonblinded , parallel-group , multicenter , dose-escalation study everolimus . Patients stratify accord concurrent use enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drug ( yes v ) . Patients receive oral temozolomide daily day 2-5 course 1 day 1-5 subsequent course . Patients also receive oral everolimus daily day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients newly diagnose disease receive 6 course treatment . Patients recurrent disease achieve response ( partial complete response ) stable disease may continue treatment disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient per stratum receive escalate dos everolimus maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity first course therapy . Once MTD determine , additional 6 patient treated MTD . Patients ' archival diagnostic tumor tissue evaluate study correlative molecular study ( immunohistochemical staining ) mammalian target rapamycin inhibition status ( mTOR activity ) pretreatment molecular marker . Blood sample take periodically course 1 pharmacokinetic study . After completion study therapy , patient follow 4 week . Patients stable respond disease follow every 3 month relapse progression . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
