	<brief_summary>This phase II study patient thymoma thymic carcinoma think significant risk recurrence follow surgical removal . This study involve use combine chemotherapy radiation therapy prior surgery , hop increase chance complete resection . The chemoradiotherapy protocol one use extensively disease , side effect therefore well-documented . Patients thymomas think significant risk recurrence ( x-ray pathology criterion ) allow participate , undergo combine chemotherapy radiation chest follow surgical removal tumor postoperative chemotherapy . The main outcome measure rate pathological complete response ( e.g . active tumor resect specimen ) preoperative treatment . Patients receive postoperative treatment base surgical pathologic criterion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Past experience suggest ability completely remove thymoma use surgery important preventing recurrence . Strategies would help surgeon 's ability completely remove tumor therefore need investigate . This study represent multi-institutional , phase II pilot trial preoperative chemoradiotherapy follow surgical resection postoperative chemotherapy patient invasive thymoma thymic carcinoma significant risk recurrence . We hypothesize strategy well-tolerated produce response resectability rate exceed previously publish involve surgical resection alone , preoperative chemotherapy follow surgery . Patients locally advanced thymoma , base radiographic biopsy criterion , undergo pretreatment compute tomography ( CT ) scan positron emission tomography ( PET ) follow concurrent ( simultaneous ) chemotherapy ( cisplatin etoposide ) radiation . After therapy , patient reassess use compute tomography ( CT ) PET , undergo surgical resection tumor . Following resection , patient either observed , treated postoperative chemotherapy , chemotherapy radiation . Correlative genomic , serologic pathologic study also perform .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Biopsyproven thymoma thymic carcinoma . Invasive thymoma determine specific radiographic criterion determine CT scan . Acceptable kidney , liver , bone marrow , respiratory function . Karnofsy performance status great 80 % . Patients must CT chest IV contrast within 60 day enrollment . Tumors large 8cm great diameter CT scan . For tumor 58cm great diameter CT scan , one follow radiographic criterion must also present IV contrast CT Scan : Multifocal calcification Heterogeneous appearance Irregular scallop border Obvious great vessel invasion encirclement Considered unable medically tolerate surgical resection time initial presentation . Radiographic evidence stage IVA thymoma . Pretreatment biopsy show WHO type A thymoma unless obvious great vessel invasion/encirclement present CT scan . Previous radiation therapy chest would preclude administration radiation . Patents receive investigational drug .</criteria>
