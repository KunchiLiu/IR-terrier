	<brief_summary>One form breast cancer , know inflammatory breast cancer ( IBC ) , characterize diffuse erythema ( redness ) edema ( peau d'orange ) breast . This type cancer aggressive poorly understood . It rare United States ( 4 percent case ) , common Egypt Tunisia ( 23 percent case ) . Conducting case-control study IBC complicate several factor , include lack standardize criterion IBC . In addition , collect pre-chemotherapy tissue blood sample IBC patient difficult treatment begin immediately diagnosis . In pilot study , National Cancer Institute collaborate two major cancer center two hospital ( Egypt Tunisia ) determine feasibility case-control study IBC . The study assess number characteristic IBC case , feasibility identifying case diagnosis , availability control subject ; collect frozen pre-treatment tumor tissue five IBC case determine whether RNA isolation possible ; obtain digital photograph breast IBC case ; demonstrate collaboration institution personnel involve study . The study last approximately one year . Participating hospital identify IBC case . Consenting patient undergo breast examination examine surgeon complete Initial Examination Form ( IEF ) . Digital photograph breast ( face ) take link study ID number . Tissue examination result enter IEF . For five selected case , additional pre-treatment tumor tissue collect frozen . This pilot study assess availability control case-control study investigate number type admission Ear , Nose , Throat Ophthalmology Departments participate hospital 2000-2003 , use computerized record .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Breast cancer characterize diffuse erythema edema , peau d'orange , breast ( inflammatory breast cancer ( IBC ) ) rare , particularly aggressive , poorly understood . The extent redness edema peau d'orange , breast required diagnosis IBC standardize . According recent American Joint Committee Cancer ( AJCC ) definition inflammatory breast cancer , sign redness edema peau d'orange , cover majority breast , arisen quickly . Breast cancer redness edema peau d'orange , account approximately 4 percent breast cancer United States , 23 percent breast cancer Egypt Tunisia . The propose pilot study determine feasibility conduct case-control study inflammatory breast cancer collaboration National Cancer Institute-Cairo , Egypt , Institut Salah Azaiz , Tunis , Tunisia , major cancer center Egypt Tunisia , Cairo University Hospital Charles Nicolle Hospital , affiliate general hospital control select . Currently , neither case study hospital collect data number inflammatory breast cancer case meet AJCC definition use propose case-control study . In addition , geographic distribution IBC case two study hospital ( knowledge necessary selection appropriate control ) unknown . The goal pilot study assess feasibility follow critical component case-control study : 1 ) identifying sufficient number IBC case time diagnosis two study hospital ; 2 ) select appropriate hospital-based control subject ; 3 ) collect frozen pre-treatment tumor tissue ; 4 ) obtain digital photograph breast IBC case ; 5 ) communicate work collaboratively study hospital personnel Egypt Tunisia . To accomplish objective , IBC case meet AJCC definition well case meet definition IBC identify one-year period two study hospital . Computerized record control hospital year 2000-2003 used enumerate number female patient non-chronic disease ( age geographic distribution ) Departments Ophthalmology Ear , Nose Throat ( ENT ) . Pre-treatment frozen tumor tissue digital photograph breast collect five IBC case study site .</detailed_description>
