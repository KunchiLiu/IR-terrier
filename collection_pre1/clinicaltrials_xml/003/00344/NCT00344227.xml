	<brief_summary>The PrONTO Study design evaluate response neovascular age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) patient intravitreal Lucentis use Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) imaging .

	<brief_title>Prospective OCT Study With Lucentis Neovascular AMD ( PrONTO Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II , open-label study intravitreally administer ranibizumab ( LucentisTM ) . Ranibizumab anti Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ( VEGF ) antibody fragment . Approximately 40 subject primary recurrent subfoveal choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) secondary age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) enrol . Lesion type include minimally classic occult ( predominatly occult ) lesion predominantly classic CNV , patient receive prior PDT ( 3 treatment ) . The study conduct one study site . After read informed consent question answer investigator coordinator , subject sign informed consent prior participation screen period could last 28 day determine eligibility . Fluorescein angiograms ( FA ) use determine CNV classification study eligibility . In addition , optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) provide information retinal thickness , subretinal fluid sub retinal pigment epithelium fluid study eligibility . Fluorescein angiograms OCT evaluate Bascom Palmer Reading Center . OCT image evaluate primarily use standard Zeiss Stratus OCT software ( Vers . 3 ) determine study eligibility retinal thickness . Proprietary software algorithm development yet validate FDA may use future data analysis include intial data analysis . The angiographic feature permit participation include evidence CNV subfoveal involvement lesion . The OCT feature permit participation include retinal thickness ( macular edema ) ≥300 micron , subretinal fluid ≥100 micron thickness , detachment retinal pigment epithelium ≥100 micron thickness . ETDRS visual acuity measurement must 20/40 20/400 . All eligible subject receive ranibizumab dose 500 microgram baseline every 30 day thereafter first two month . ETDRS visual acuity test OCT measurement perform prior injection . After first 3 injection ( baseline , Month-1 , Month-2 ) , patient return post-injection day 1 , 2 , 4 , 7 , 14 . OCT measurement perform visit . ETDRS visual acuity measurement perform injection day post-injection day # 14 . At Month-3 follow-up exam thereafter , vision stable improve ( stable visual acuity score= ±4 letter ; improve visual acuity score ≥ 5 letter ) previous visit , evidence leakage CNV determine fluorescein angiography OCT , injection perform . If previous criterion meet , injection continue monthly criterion fulfil . At point , injection give evidence recurrent CNV . Enrolled subject , predominantly classic CNV baseline convert predominantly classic CNV within study , offer veteporfin photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) . If patient receives PDT , injection ranibizumab visit , next injection ranibizumab perform least 1 month . Patients continue study receive additional PDT 3 month interval need . There alaways least 1 month separation PDT subsequent ranibizumab injection . The following criterion need fulfil resume injection . There need evidence vision loss ≥ 5 letter associate evidence leakage CNV determine OCT fluorescein angiography , new-onset macular hemorrhage , new onset classic CNV , increase central macular thickness ≥ 100 micron . Only one eye choose “ study eye ” . Only study eye receive intravitreal injection ranibizumab . Subjects schedule monthly visit throughout study evaluation safety efficacy . Subjects first treatment ranibizumab injection inject physician Day 0 undergo retinal analysis OCT Days 1 , 2 , 4 , 7 14 first 3 study treatment . At subsequent visit ( every month [ 30±7 day ] ) , subject safety evaluation evaluate physician prior possible retreatment . After month 3 subject contact site personnel 2 day ( ±1 day ) study treatment elicit report decrease vision , eye pain , unusual redness , new ocular symptom ; subject also ask whether take prescribed self-administered post-injection antimicrobial . During first 3 month , question ask return clinic . Every 3 month , subject undergo fluorescein angiography color fundus photography . Subjects final safety visit Month 24 . Fundus photography fluorescein angiography perform baseline month 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 . Additional fluorescein angiography perform visit decide injection stop ( continue past Month-3 ) resume due decrease vision possible evidence leakage CNV . Optical coherence tomography perform baseline day 1 , 2 , 4 , 7 , 14 first 3 injection . Since preliminary data suggest OCT image detect early manifestation recurrent CNV , patient monitor injection stop use monthly ophthalmologic exam , ETDRS visual acuity measurement , OCT image monthly follow-up visit month 24 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>• All subject must meet follow criterion eligible study entry : Signed informed consent Age great 50 year Active primary recurrent subfoveal lesion CNV secondary AMD study eye , define Table 1 Lesions occult CNV classic CNV component permissible . However , predominantly classic CNV ( welldemarcated hyperfluorescence boundary early phase fluorescein angiogram ) present , patient must prior PDT ( 3 previous photodynamic therapy treatment ) . The OCT feature permit participation include retinal thickness ( macular edema ) ≥300 micron , subretinal fluid ≥100 micron thickness , detachment retinal pigment epithelium ≥100 micron thickness The total area CNV ( include classic occult component ) encompass within lesion must ≥ 50 % total lesion area The total lesion area must &lt; 12 disc area ( DA ) size . Best correct visual acuity , use ETDRS chart , 20/40 20/400 ( Snellen equivalent ) study eye Only one eye assess study . If eye eligible , one good acuity select treatment study unless , base medical reason , investigator deems eye appropriate candidate treatment study . • Prior treatment verteporfin , externalbeam radiation therapy , transpupillary thermotherapy study eye ( predominantly classic CNV however include subject 3 prior PDT treatment ) Treatment verteporfin nonstudy eye le 7 day precede Day 0 Previous participation clinical trial ( either eye ) involve anti angiogenic drug ( pegaptanib , ranibizumab , anecortave acetate , protein kinase C inhibitor , etc . ) Previous subfoveal focal laser photocoagulation involve foveal center study eye Laser photocoagulation ( juxtafoveal extrafoveal ) study eye within 1 month precede Day 0 History vitrectomy , submacular surgery , surgical intervention AMD study eye Previous participation study investigational drug within 1 month precede Day 0 ( exclude vitamin mineral ) Lesion Characteristics Subfoveal fibrosis atrophy study eye CNV either eye due cause , ocular histoplasmosis , trauma , pathologic myopia</criteria>
