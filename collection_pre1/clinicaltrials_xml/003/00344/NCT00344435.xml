	<brief_summary>This international study identify genetic factor may influence development inhibitory antibody patient hemophilia A treatment factor VIII . Bleeding episodes patient inhibitor often difficult treat . Previous research indicate genetic factor play role development inhibitor . A good understanding influence gene treatment complication may helpful predict , treat prevent inhibitor . People family one member severe factor VIII deficiency one history inhibitor may eligible study . Participants fill form question person 's relationship family member take part study . Those hemophilia provide brief medical history , include hemophilia-related information , inhibitor history presence condition hepatitis C HIV . All participant blood sample take laboratory research test .</brief_summary>
