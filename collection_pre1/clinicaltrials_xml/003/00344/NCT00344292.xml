	<detailed_description>Atherosclerosis condition deposit fat , cholesterol , substance build along inner wall artery ; deposit know plaque . As plaque build , increase risk blood clot , heart attack , stroke . Research show risk develop atherosclerosis influence heredity . However , researcher unable identify specific gene associate risk . Single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) small genetic variation occur within individual 's DNA . In study , researcher analyze DNA many individual difference SNP pattern . The goal study determine SNP pattern associate development atherosclerosis . The data study may lead new strategy early identification high risk individual may benefit aggressive treatment prevent development atherosclerosis . This study recruit new participant . DNA collect analyzed participant two exist studiesâ€”the Pathobiological Determinants Atherosclerosis Youth ( PDAY ) study Multi-Ethnic Study Atherosclerosis ( MESA ) . DNA PDAY participant obtain liver sample gather autopsy follow participant ' death ; DNA MESA participant obtain blood collect routine study visit . There additional study visit participant , DNA sample study information keep confidential . Genetic testing perform determine association SNPs subclinical atherosclerosis , form condition prior onset symptom . The study evaluate specific variation SNPs subclinical disease among different ethnic group , may help explain certain ethnic group higher rate atherosclerosis . The study also examine association SNPs indicator subclinical clinical atherosclerosis , include thickness artery , heart calcium level , blood pressure level .</detailed_description>
