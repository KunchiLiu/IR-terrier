	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Evaluate Efficacy Refined Methods Mitigate Indoor Allergens North Carolina Boston , Massachusetts Homes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose conduct study evaluate efficacy intensive cockroach cockroach allergen removal program mitigate cockroach allergen level house dust le 8 Units Bla g1 allergen protein per gram vacuum dust kitchen TV/family room sample less 2 Units Bla g1 per gram vacuum dust bedroom sample . In addition , propose test effectiveness method combine dry steam clean conjunction Capture ( Trademark ) carpet clean mitigation dust mite allergens bedroom carpeting . Candidate housing unit cockroach allergen mitigation identify ongoing entomology research project conduct part project NC06405 North Carolina Agricultural Research Service , entitle Insect-Specific Target Systems Development Novel Tools Cockroach Control . This project direct Dr. Coby Schal , Department Entomology North Carolina State University . Prior enrollment home allergen intervention study , 10 cockroach infest home sample ( intervention ) use vacuum swab sample procedure describe intervention study protocol . These visit coordinate coincide home visit associate project NC06405 involve intervention data collection dust sample collection . Documentation cockroach infestation sample home accomplish review infestation data collect part project NC06405 activity . The purpose sampling-only visit test refine sample collection method , train study staff sample collection methodology , confirm heterogeneity cockroach allergen distribution within cockroach infest dwelling prior initiation intervention study . For intervention study , home past history cockroach infestation contact . Residents candidate study home contact telephone , provide brief overview study interview determine home qualifies participation . The telephone interview focus occupant assessment cockroach infestation level , history related topic . Homes appear moderate infestation base telephone screen information schedule Screening Visit . During Screening Visit , administration inform consent form single adult home resident , home environmental questionnaire administer home environmental observation make . In addition , adhesive tape ( sticky ) trap place assessment infestation level hand-drawn room layout map construct document sticky trap location . Approximately 3 day sticky trap placement , Baseline visit conduct assess sticky trapping result . If sufficient insect trap , vacuum sample swab sample collect three study room allergen analysis ( kitchen , TV/family room , one bedroom . As soon possible Baseline sampling complete , home schedule initial intervention visit , comprise general cleaning , occupant education general principal integrate pest management . An initial extermination effort apply soon possible completion general home cleaning initial target cleaning , focus area high allergen concentration determine swab sample result , occur within 10-15 day extermination . At 1 , 2 , 4 month point initial target cleaning , sticky trapping perform confirm effectiveness extermination , vacuum swab sample repeat , brief occupant follow-up question administer occupant education enforce . Based upon result sticky trapping , extermination effort may repeat . Targeted cleaning conduct follow-up swab vacuum sample contain detectable Bla g1 allergen . Six month follow-up visit also conduct identical 1 , 2 4 month visit except include repeat extermination , target cleaning activity occupant education . Recruitment continue 16 home enrol cockroach intervention arm study , goal completion least 12 home North Carolina 6 month follow-up visit . Up 5 multi-unit dwelling enrol inner city Boston , Massachusetts area order test mitigation strategy inner-city , multiunit dwelling Northeastern U.S . Candidate dust mite intervention home recruit local advertisement person person communication identify enroll 8 home bedroom carpet dust contains combine level Der f1 Der p1 &gt; 10 ug/gram vacuum dust . Intervention apply single bedroom consist installation impermeable bedding cover , occupant education , carpet steam cleaning follow Capture ( Trademark ) clean carpet . Follow-up vacuum dust sample occur 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 month time point immediately follow repeat steam cleaning follow Capture ( trademark ) cleaning 1 , 2 , 4 month time point . Completion 6 home 6 month follow-up visit project . Only local North Carolina home enrol dust mite allergen intervention .</detailed_description>
