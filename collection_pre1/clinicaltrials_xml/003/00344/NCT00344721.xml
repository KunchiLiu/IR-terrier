	<brief_title>A Placebo Controlled Double Masked Clinical Assessment Study Essential Fatty Acid Supplement Its Effect Patients With Apparent Aqueous Deficient Dry Eye Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effect essential fatty acid Meibomian Gland lipid composition aqueous tear production may great previously think . Dry Eye syndromes afflict million people worldwide , 10 million United States alone . Typically , symptom associate dry eye disease include ocular burning , foreign body sensation , photophobia symptom result overall chronic discomfort patient . Unfortunately , effect Essential Fatty Acids aqueous tear Meibomian lipid ( AT ) establish date . The purpose study well understand role essential fatty acid play maintenance meibomian gland lipid overall production retention aqueous tear . Patients diagnose dry eye syndrome select participate study . Once qualified take part trial , participant receive four oral dos soft-gel capsule take daily ( QD ) . Omega-3 Fatty Acid tablet contains : EPA ( eicosapentaenoic acid ) Dose : 450mg DHA ( docosahexaenoic acid ) Dose : 300mg Flaxseed Oil ( organic ) Dose : 1000mg Patients placebo receive nutritional supplement contain wheat germ oil EFA ’ . During trial , patient encourage change diet , use topical ophthalmics systemic therapy use study treatment . Patient ’ topical therapy standardize identification exam patient use TheraTears™ four time daily . Patients direct take masked capsule follow manner : 4 soft-gels morning . Masked medication , TheraTears™ randomization table provide sponsor . Subject follow test perform first visit ( initiate treatment ) follow-up ( three month treatment ) visit , : complete eye exam , ( vital stain ocular surface tear break-up time ) ; completion questionnaire : Ocular Surface Index ( OSDI ) Patient Symptomology Questionnaire present patient review answer visit : Before initiate treatment three month therapy , meibography , fluorophotometry perform order measure tear volume , flow turnover , Schirmer test ; tear evaporation use evaporometer ; meibomian gland drop determine infrared photography meibomian gland secretion biochemical analysis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient 18 year age , patient willing able comply protocol , plan change diet , topical systemic drug course study . Ocular symptoms consistent dry eye insidious onset great three month duration . Ocular surface vital stain consistent aqueous deficient dry eye less +1 conjunctival injection minimal lid inflammation Any patient use topical eye drop artificial tear . Any patient punctual occlusion punctual plug . Patients active ocular infection inflammatory disease , history herpetic keratitis , history retinal detachment , concurrent contact lens use trial period , ocular surgery within past six month , patient glaucoma , anterior membrane dystrophy , active trichiasis eyelid globe malposition abnormality , e.g. , entropion , ectropion , etc . Patients Epiphora ( excessive tearing ) . Moreover , patient take medication know effect aqueous tear production meibomian secretion . Patient must participate ( currently participate ) investigational therapeutic drug device trial within previous 30 day prior start date trial . In addition , patient suffer organic brain syndrome major psychiatric disorder would interfere compliance subjective reporting discourage participate trial .</criteria>
