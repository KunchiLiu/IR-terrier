	<brief_title>Severe Post Partum Haemorrhage ( PPH ) : A Randomized Trial Transversal Intervention 6 French Perinatal Networks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Post partum haemorrhage ( PPH ) estimate occur 5 10 % delivery . In France represent 39 000 78 000 case yearly , among , 10 20 % life threaten event mother . Moreover , PPH remain leading cause maternal mortality France , contribute great proportion maternal death comparable European country . According National Committee Maternal Mortality , 80 % death due PPH « avoidable » death , involve unrecognised diagnosis , delay provide care underestimation severity blood spoliation . These factor suggest weakness capacity provide adequate care presence PPH , seem relate organisation care inside maternity unit . On hand , although specific clinical intervention prove efficient decrease postpartum blood loss , thus result recent national international recommendation management PPH , integration guideline clinical practice still achieve ( preliminary unpublished result survey conduct maternity unit France ) . Available literature relate various health issue show use enhance method dissemination clinical practice guideline improve translation guideline practice . Therefore , intervention combine several enhanced dissemination method may help improve actual management PPH case . The impact propose intervention evaluate randomised trial . The target intervention , give maternity unit , entire group health professional involve delivery care . Therefore , unit randomisation maternity unit . Hypothesis A “ multifaceted ” intervention program aim increase responsiveness care giver , adequacy care provide , efficacy organisation care , presence abnormal blood loss immediate post partum impact incidence severe PPH cost care current method dissemination clinical practice guideline . Intervention Intervention group . The intervention include three component : ( 1 ) outreach visit local presentation evidence-based clinical practice guideline management PPH , discussion applicability context local organisation ; ( 2 ) educational visit , reminder - check list , “ PPH emergency case ” contain appropriate material – used case PPH , propose ; ( 3 ) finally , case severe PPH review peer review session organize participate unit , help identifying weakness care provide , need improvement . Control group . The propose guideline management PPH disseminate participate perinatal network ; unit free implement convenience . Randomisation procedure The trial follow cluster randomise trial design . Randomisation maternity unit stratify region , status ( public versus private ) size ( annual number delivery ) . The stratified design guarantee comparability two arm trial baseline . Outcome measure The primary outcome incidence severe PPH ( number severe PPH number delivery ) . A severe PPH define PPH associate one following : peripartum haemoglobin drop great 4g/dl , blood transfusion , arterial embolisation , surgical procedure hysterectomy arterial ligation , transfer mother intensive care unit , maternal death . Secondary outcome include cost care cost/efficacy ratio , incidence adverse effect uterotonic drug . Number patient required Estimation intracluster correlation coefficient : Since estimation parameter available literature , base estimation result unpublished survey provide data declare incidence severe PPH maternity unit . Based result , intracluster correlation coefficient estimate 0.006 . Assuming incidence 1 % primary outcome , order detect decrease 0.6 % ( 40 % relative decrease ) , 80 % power , 5 % risk , take account average number delivery per unit estimate intracluster correlation , require sample size 58 945 delivery group 117890 total . The 6 participate perinatal network include 133 maternity unit , perform 133 000 delivery annually . Eligibility criterion For maternity unit All maternity unit belong one six perinatal network study eligible . For woman All woman deliver gestational age great 22 week , one participate maternity unit study period , eligible . Trial process Recruitment All maternity unit pertain one 6 perinatal network invite participate . The trial protocol present obstetrician , anaesthetists midwife . Consent A write consent obtain head obstetrics department administrative director unit . Intervention In participate perinatal network , team pair obstetrician midwife charge intervention program . Start date : March 2005 Expected complete date : December 2007 Data collection Baseline data : The comparability two arm trial evaluate data collect maternity unit level , include characteristic resource unit , characteristic woman deliver . Post-intervention data : Evaluation impact intervention clinical practice relate PPH management base individual data . What ? Detailed information component care provide labour , delivery immediate post partum , relate prevention management PPH , collect individual case PPH . When collect ? Data collection begin 3 month outreach visit , include incident case PPH one year . How ? Cases PPH identify prospectively , accord follow definition:1 ) vaginal delivery , PPH define abnormal bleeding diagnose within 24 hour postpartum , require uterine revision manual delivery placenta , /or result vaginal cervical tear , include haemorrhagic episiotomy ; C section delivery , PPH define abnormal bleeding diagnose team charge ; 2 ) peripartum haemoglobin drop great 2gr/dl . PPH case identify care provider notify trial research assistant collect individual information obstetrical record . Outcome data Evaluation impact intervention incidence severe PPH . What ? Incident case severe PPH ( see definition ) identify subgroup incident case PPH . When collect ? Data collection begin 3 month outreach visit , include incident case severe PPH one year . How ?
