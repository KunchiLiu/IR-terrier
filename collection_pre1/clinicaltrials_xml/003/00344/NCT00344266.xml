	<brief_summary>This study look gene expression ( whether particular set gene activate [ `` turned '' ] deactivate [ `` turn '' ] ) overweight people compare non-overweight individual . It also investigate potential role inflammatory protective substance produce naturally body within fat tissue . Findings study may lead development way predict respond best diet therapy . Healthy individual 25 45 year age may eligible study . Overweight subject must BMI 25 40 , non-overweight control subject BMI 19 24.9 . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood test electrocardiogram ( EKG ) . They instruct record dietary intake 3-day period collect urine 24-hour interval . Participants food record review week screen visit . They schedule overnight admission Clinical Center . Non-overweight subject one two inpatient stay ; overweight subject six inpatient stay plus frequent nutrition counseling session . During 2-day hospital admission , follow study perform : - DEXA scan determine percentage body fat tissue . The subject lie table 15 60 minute body composition measure low-dose x-ray . - Single-slice CT scan compare amount fat tissue skin abdomen . The subject lie table 5 10 minute CT scanner measure body composition low-dose x-ray . - Subcutaneous fat microdialysis investigate weight loss affect activity fat tissue . A small tube ( catheter ) place fat tissue skin abdomen numb skin local anesthetic . Fluid sample collect tube . The procedure last overnight . In five non-overweight control , small amount substance call leukotriene B4 put fat tissue help adjust instrument use study . - Air-displacement plethysmography measure body composition . Subjects wear close-fitting clothing enter small capsule call Bod-Pod . They breathe normally capsule body fat composition study . - Blood test . Blood sample draw analyze thyroid hormone , lipid , glucose , electrolytes , clot factor , kidney function , red cell DNA . - Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp measure effect insulin body derive index insulin-sensitivity . Catheters place vein arm vein hand side body . Insulin glucose infused catheter arm , blood sample draw catheter hand every 5 minute measure glucose level . The test last 2 hour . - Subcutaneous fat biopsy find weight loss affect fat tissue characteristic , gene regulation ability store glucose . A small sample fat tissue obtain skin abdomen numb area anesthetic . - Nutrition counsel overweight subject . A nutritionist review food record design personalize diet participant . - Weight loss intervention overweight subject . In addition individual nutritional counseling , group session provide every 2 week first 3 month study every month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity global public health problem epidemic proportion . It source considerable morbidity early mortality U.S. associate increase risk diabetes , hypertension , cardiovascular disease , cancer . In recent year , new evolve concept emerge regard obesity chronic endocrine disorder inflammation . Moreover , grow body evidence indicate obesity alters profile constellation gene change biomarkers inflammation gene expression reverse weight loss . In clinical protocol , propose test idea particular set gene activate ( deactivate ) Overweight Subjects use standard microarray technique sample subcutaneous adipose tissue derive biopsy . In addition , study local adipose tissue microenvironment mean microdialysis . The role number adipokines , inflammatory mediators/cytokines , novel lipid product analyze use sensitive Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry ELISA method . The study design incorporate two basic objective : 1 . Comparison Non-Overweight Controls v . Overweight Subjects Baseline 2 . Correlation change Overweight patient time lose weight calorie-restricted diet . To end , 30 Non-Overweight Controls ( BMI 19.0 24.9 ) 80 Overweight Subjects ( BMI 25.0 45.0 ) enrol . Baseline study , obtain participant include : blood test , anthropometric index , body composition air-displacement plethysmography , indirect calorimetry , intravenous glucose tolerance test index insulin sensitivity , subcutaneous adipose tissue microdialysis , subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy . These procedure require overnight hospital admission Clinical Center . Overweight Subjects prescribe calorie-restricted diet follow one year . They undergo repeat study regular , 3-month interval assess serial change various parameter provide correlative data degree rate weight loss achieve . Taken together , study shed light provide fundamental insight nature alter gene expression release inflammatory cytokine mediator characterize overweight state dynamic series event take place dietary intervention lead weight loss . It anticipate number change relate macrophage know inflammatory marker though doubtless important lead yet discover . Thus , hope study ultimately lead identification novel gene underlie important metabolic derangement associate obesity response different treatment modality .</detailed_description>
