	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine equipotent dose ropinirole pramipexole patient switch pramipexole ropinirole patient moderate severe primary Restless Legs Syndrome ( RLS ) . The rationale behind Switch patient Restless Legs Syndrome maintain stable efficacy tolerability correctly switch one dopamine agonist equipotent dose another .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SWITCH : Restless Legs Patients Switched Ropinirole From Pramipexole</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Dopamine agonists ropinirole ( Requip ) pramipexole ( Mirapex ) effective treatment Restless Legs Syndrome Parkinson Disease . However , although safety efficacy may establish , common clinician switch therapy order seek optimal symptomatic relief patient . The best strategy switch dopamine agonist Requip currently undetermined . Currently , ropinirole medication indicate treatment moderate severe RLS . Every patient individual response dopamine agonist . Usually patient switch one dopamine agonist another due follow factor : - Lack response loss efficacy - Predictable dose-related side effect - Ergot-associated adverse event ( pulmonary fibrosis , cardiac valvulopathy , etc . ) - Sleep event ( sudden onset sleep ) - Peripheral edema - Patient co-morbidities The lack clinical data make difficult recommend switch guideline suitable patient . It therefore recommend switch regimen base clinical judgment individualization patient . Switching one dopamine agonist another dependent upon number factor include : 1 . The currently prescribe dopamine agonist 2 . The dose current dopamine agonist 3 . Whether dopamine agonist administer monotherapy adjunct therapy L-dopa 4 . Individual patient response current agonist dopamine agonist ( efficacy tolerability ) 5 . Stage disease In placebo-controlled , clinical trial Requip , protocol switch patient Requip utilized . Patients generally require discontinue previous dopamine agonist medication least two week prior baseline evaluation . Patients already dopamine agonist discontinue accord practice investigator . Methods switch study previously include : 1 . Withdrawal current dopamine agonist accord manufacturer 's recommendation follow initiation dopamine agonist base upon manufacturer 's recommendation 2 . An overnight switch abrupt cessation current dopamine agonist follow initiation estimate equivalent dose dopamine agonist 3 . Gradual withdrawal current dopamine agonist simultaneous upward titration dopamine agonist STUDY DESIGN SWITCH principal investigator-initiated , open-label study conduct two site , include Medical College Georgia VA Medical Center ( VAMC ) . A total 20 subject enrol MCG/VAMC . Individuals choose participate approximately three four study visit four week time period . Patients moderate severe primary Restless Legs Syndrome include study . All RLS medication stable dose least 4 week prior enrollment . Patients switch overnight Baseline Visit ratio either 1:4 1:6 Mirapex ( pramipexole ) Requip ( ropinirole ) per Conversion Table 1 : Table 1 : Conversion Table Pramipexole Dose Requip Dose ( tablet ) 1:4 conversion 0.25mg -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 1mg ( 1X1mg ) 0.5mg -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 2mg ( 1X2mg ) 0.75mg -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -3mg ( 1X 3mg ) 1:6 Conversion 0.25mg -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 1.5mg ( 3X0.5mg ) 0.5mg -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 3mg ( 1X 3mg ) 0.75mg -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- 4mg ( 1X4mg ) At baseline study visit , sign dated consent first obtain subject . In addition , inclusion/exclusion criterion review start study procedure . During course study , follow procedure perform , patient come clinic study visit ( Table 2 ) : - Health Medication Review : Ask patient answer question health , medical history , medication . ( All visit ) - Mini-Mental State Examination : Patients ask series question determine mental status . ( Visit 1 ) - CGI-S/CGI-I : ( Visits 1 , 2 , 4 ) - IRLS : ( Visits 1 , 2 , 4 ) - Epworth Sleepiness Scale : ( Visits 1 , 2 , 4 ) - ECG : An `` ECG '' `` electrocardiogram '' test measure electrical activity heart . ( Visits 1 , 2 , 4 ) - Blood Tests : The study staff draw 3 tablespoon . The study doctor use blood Hematology Chemistry panel laboratory test . ( Visit 1 ) - Pregnancy Tests : If patient female child , blood ( one extra tablespoon need perform test ) test see pregnant . Patients tell test result positive . The result test must negative order patient study . ( Visit 1 ) - Neurological Physical Exam : The study doctor perform neurological physical exam . ( Visit 1 ) - Brief Physical Exam ( Visits 2 4 ) - Concomitant Medication Review ( All visit ) - Blood Pressure , Pulse ( Visits 1 , 2 , 4 ) - Height ( Visit 1 ) - Weight ( Visit 1 ) - Study Drug : Give patient supply study drug tell take . Patients ask bring back unused study drug visit . ( Visits 1 , 2 , 4 ) - Drug Compliance ( Visits 2 , 3 , 4 ) - Adverse Event Review ( Visits 2 , 3 , 4 ) - Telephone Contact : The study doctor study staff call patient check his/her health see he/she handle study drug . If study doctor decide patient well medication , Visit 3 could consist telephone contact include review concomitant medication , adverse event , drug compliance . If patient experience breakthrough symptom , clinic visit require Visit 3 . All study visit take approximately two ( 2 ) hour telephone contact take long thirty ( 30 ) minute . Study Patients see study coordinator investigator every visit . At end study treatment , subject give treatment option ; subject option continue ropinirole return use pramipexole . Subjects return care primary care physician/neurologist . USE OF HUMAN SUBJECTS and/or HUMAN DERIVED MATERIALS SUBJECT CHARACTERISTICS Patients moderate severe Restless Legs Syndrome currently take stable dose Pramipexole approach visit MCG Movement Disorders Clinic VA Neurology Clinic ask participate SWITCH . If becomes necessary recruit outside MCG/VAMC , advertisement material submit HAC approval prior use . SWITCH double site study . We plan enroll total 25-30 individual two site . Approximately 20 patient enrol MCG/VAMC . MANAGING SIDE EFFECTS As drug , possibility unforeseeable risk side effect exist . The patient tell important new information might affect decision continue study timely manner . Their Restless Legs Syndrome may improve may worsen , despite participation . In previous study , patient take ropinirole report following side effect include : nausea , headache , dizziness , drowsiness , sleepiness . Individuals take ropinirole may experience dizziness , nausea , sweaty faintness first stand lie . Hallucinations ( unreal vision , sound , sensation ) also report patient take ropinirole , especially elderly patient , patient take ropinirole L-dopa , patient take high amount ropinirole . If patient take L-dopa Parkinson 's disease , ropinirole may worsen side effect L-dopa . Additionally , ropinirole associate sedating effect , include somnolence possibility fall asleep engage activity daily live , include operation motor vehicle . Syncope symptomatic hypertension may also occur , particularly initial treatment dose titration . Patients caution rise rapidly sit lie . Because possible additive effect , recommend caution exercise patient sleep disorder take sedate medication , alcohol , CNS depressant , medication increase ropinirole plasma level . Patients get medical help contact study doctor study staff , side effect study . If study doctor considers patient 's best interest discontinue current medication enter study , patient may experience withdrawal symptom . The risk discomfort blood draw vein include possibility pain bruise site blood draw ; occasional feeling lightheadedness ; , rarely , infection site blood draw . Currently , Ropinirole FDA approve drug treatment RLS . There currently medication use treatment Restless Legs Syndrome Pramipexole , gabapentin , Sinemet , clonazepam , opiods ( pain medication ) , benzodiazepine ( sleep medication ) , anticonvulsant ( medication prevent seizure ) , iron therapy . The study doctor discuss benefit risk associate alternative patient . If research relate event arises , study team manage patient 's care . In event emergency , research team available time , day night , via MCG page operator .</detailed_description>
