	<brief_summary>This study design prospective , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind analysis atorvastatin 80 mg versus placebo administer average 4 hour prior percutaneous coronary intervention [ PCI ] ( least 2 hour ) patient present unstable angina . Only patient negative cardiac biomarkers , measure 2 separate occasion hour apart eligible inclusion . Furthermore , patient already high-dose statin therapy ; patient take statin within 24 hour prior PCI ; patient contraindication statin exclude study . The primary endpoint quantitative troponin level 18-24 hour PCI . At enrollment total 150 patient ( 75 per group ) , study power detect 30 % difference troponin level . Secondary endpoint include elevation creatine kinase ( CK ) CK-MB upper limit normal , change C-reactive protein ( CRP ) level baseline thrombolysis myocardial infarction ( TIMI ) myocardial perfusion grade . All patient start statin therapy day procedure , deem appropriate treating physician .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>STUDY OBJECTIVES : 1 . The primary endpoint study evaluate effect single high dose atorvastatin versus placebo peri-procedural myonecrosis , measure troponin T ( TnT ) , percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) patient present acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . 2 . Secondary endpoint include measurement biomarkers myocyte injury ( CK , CK-MB ) inflammation ( CRP ) . 3 . Other secondary endpoint include relative angiographic efficacy atorvastatin versus placebo post PCI growth tissue level perfusion circumference post PCI growth tissue level perfusion brightness use digital subtraction angiography . METHODS : I . Selection Number Patients The study subject select patient present BIDMC cardiac catheterization . Eligible patient identify cardiac catheterization hold area prior procedure . After obtain informed consent , patient randomize single dose atorvastatin placebo , administer hold area 4 hour prior procedure . There total 150 subject enrol study . There total 2500 PCIs perform BIDMC per year , third ACS . We anticipate 30-40 % patient ACS eligible study participation . II . Informed Consent Informed consent obtain individual prior enrolment study accord local Internal Review Board guideline . III . Pretreatment Data Collection Baseline clinical data record enrolment include : Subject 's age , sex , weight height , diabetes , hypertension , smoke status , hypercholesterolemia ( include cholesterol level available ) , presence coronary peripheral artery disease prior history PCI coronary artery bypass surgery . Further , current medication record . A detailed angina history collect patient medical record look evidence unstable angina define Braunwald . IV . Medications A . Study Medication Patients randomly assign atorvastatin 80 mg po placebo double-blind fashion . The study medication administer immediately inform consent obtain patient randomized treatment group cardiac catheterization hold area . Given typical waiting time first presentation hold area PCI non-emergent case , estimate study medication administer 4 hour prior procedure ( minimal time 2 hour ) . All patient receive single dose study medication prior procedure . After completion procedure , statin therapy withhold next day . Eligible patient receive statin therapy accord treat physician ' preference . All potential adverse reaction study medication record . B. Concomitant Therapy Aspirin ( 325 mg/day ) administer prior intervention follow-up . Clopidogrel ( 300 mg 600 mg bolus follow 75 mg/day ) administer post-stent deployment . It expect majority patient receive glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor procedure 18 hour thereafter . V. Procedures A . Laboratory Tests At baseline , level troponin , CK CK-MB obtain time presentation immediately prior PCI . Patients serum marker upper limit normal exclude study . Post-procedural enzyme obtain 6-8 hour procedure next morning ( 18-24 hour procedure ) . Patients elevate enzyme may undergo sample determine peak enzyme rise . The peak troponin level obtain post-procedural blood draw use primary endpoint . Furthermore , baseline CRP level obtain prior PCI next day . B . Digital Subtraction Angiography To quantitate kinetics dye entry myocardium , digital subtraction angiography use . Digital subtraction angiography perform end diastole align cineframe image dye fill myocardium frame dye first reach peak brightness . The spine , rib , diaphragm epicardial artery subtract . A representative region myocardium sample free overlap epicardial arterial branch determine increase gray scale brightness myocardium . The circumference myocardial blush measure use handheld planimeter ( Fowler , Inc ) . The frame count ÷ number frame per second use measure time elapse angiography quantitate rate rise growth ( cm/sec ) brightness ( gray/sec ) myocardial blush . Blush also assess visually use TIMI myocardial perfusion grade .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must age 18 . Patients must provide write informed consent . Patients present unstable angina ( defined new onset chest pain , accelerate chest pain , chest pain rest STsegment depression electrocardiogram [ EKG ] ) Patients undergoing successful coronary stent implantation ( presume ) culprit lesion ( define &lt; 50 % residual stenosis ) . Any patient unable give write informed consent . Any condition , investigator 's opinion , would interfere optimal participation study produce significant risk patient . Patients present STelevation myocardial infarction ( MI ) . Patients elevate troponin , CK , CKMB ( upper limit normal ) . Patients already highdose statin therapy ( define statin equivalent atorvastatin ≥ 40 mg ) . Patients take statin agent within 24 hour presentation cardiac catheterization laboratory . Patients active hepatic disease myositis , statin therapy contraindicate . Patients hypersensitivity atorvastatin . Patients procedural complication , include unsuccessful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( PTCA ) /stenting , major sidebranch occlusion , flowlimiting dissection completion procedure , emergent coronary artery bypass surgery , periprocedural thrombus formation distal embolization , stent thrombosis within first 24 hour , repeat emergent PCI within 24 hour , death within 24 hour . Cardiogenic shock .</criteria>
