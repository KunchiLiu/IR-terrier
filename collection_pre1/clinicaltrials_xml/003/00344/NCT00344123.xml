	<brief_summary>Tipranavir ( TPV ) plus ritonavir ( RTV ) indicate use part antiretroviral treatment regimen resistant HIV-1 infection adult patient . Since significant cholesterol triglyceride elevation commonly report TPV/RTV treatment , effective treatment strategy critical prevent long-term cardiovascular event . Rosuvastatin , potent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme ( HMG-CoA ) reductase inhibitor , unlikely interact TPV/RTV since extensively metabolize , however , formal drug interaction study need combination recommend . This study examine pharmacokinetic interaction tipranavir/ritonavir ( TPV/RTV [ TPV/r ] 500 mg/200 mg twice daily [ B.I.D ] ) single dose rosuvastatin two co-administered healthy adult volunteer . The investigator hypothesize tipranavir 500 mg co-administered low-dose ritonavir 200 mg rosuvastatin ( 10 mg ) significant clinical interaction occur .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) Study Single-dose Rosuvastatin Tipranavir/Ritonavir Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , open-label pharmacokinetic study healthy HIV seronegative adult . This study examine pharmacokinetic interaction steady-state TPV/r 500 mg/200 mg B.I.D . single dose rosuvastatin 10 mg drug co-administered . Rosuvastatin 24 hour pharmacokinetic sampling perform day 1-2 12-13 . Rosuvastatin 48 hr sample collect day 3 day 14 . Tipranavir ritonavir 12 hour pharmacokinetic sampling day 11 12 . Safety assessment ( physical examination , vital sign measurement , clinical laboratory test ) perform screening , study prior discharge . Subjects continuously monitored adverse event throughout duration study . On Day 1 , subject receive single 10 mg dose rosuvastatin . Beginning Day 3 , subject receive combination TPV 500 mg/RTV 200 mg twice daily 11 day ( Days 3-13 ) . On Day 12 , subject receive single 10 mg dose rosuvastatin co-administered TPV/r .</detailed_description>
