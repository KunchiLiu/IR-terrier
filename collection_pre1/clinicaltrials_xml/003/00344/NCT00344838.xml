	<brief_title>Customized Laser Ablation : Comparing Results LADAR Vision VISX Platforms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In past year , several custom laser ablation platform emerge marketplace two currently approve FDA . They LADAR CustomLasik ( Alcon : Ft. Worth , TX ) VISX Wavefront System ( VISX : Santa Clara , CA ) . Although use Hartmann-Shack wave sense principle , basic distinction wave capture processing technology . Moreover , fundamental difference far centration , registration , ablation technology concern . Evaluating compare result two system assorted category patient would help u select appropriate laser platform patient . Once patient schedule undergo customize laser ablation , routine preoperative examination . The following test gather evaluated doctor order determine eligibility treatment . If patient qualifies custom laser ablation , information also use study long give write consent . Pre-operative Visit ( Screening visit ) : Date Visit , Patient Initials , Date Birth , Sex , Race , Assessment visual need , Ocular history , History contact lens wear , Medical history , Allergies food drug , Medication , family history , Distance Near Vision ( without correction ) , Auto-refraction , Refraction , eye dominance , Keratometry , Visual Acuity , Pupil size ( bright dim lighting ) , Afferent Pupillary Defect ( ADP ) , Ocular motility , Ophthalmoscopy , Cycloplegic refraction , Pachymetry , Intaocular Pressure test , Custom Vue ( VISX ) , LADARWave ( LADAR ) , Schirmers test anesthetic . Typically , procedure employ part “ standard care ” patient seek custom LASIK treatment . Furthermore , two additional procedure perform “ reseach ” measure . These visual acuity Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) vision chart contrast sensitivity . Post-Operative visit ( Day 1 , Week 1 , Month 1 , Month 3 , Month 6 , Month 12 ) : ETDRS Visual Acuity , contrast sensitivity along questionnaire pertaining study patient visual problem experience complete patient week 1 visit thereafter . These procedure intend part research . Additional data gather part “ standard care ” include : date visit , patient initial , visual acuity , refraction , Intraocular Pressure ( discretion physician ) , Custom Vue ( VISX ) LADARWave . Both Custom Vue LADAR measurement take 3-month visit ! The research project propose compare result two FDA approve laser ablation treatment method . While treatment modality consider standard care decide perform customize laser treatment , “ comparison ” intend part research project .</detailed_description>
