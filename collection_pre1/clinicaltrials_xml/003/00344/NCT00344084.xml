	<brief_summary>This study examine people become infected leishmaniasis parasite develop skin lesion others . The parasite cause leishmaniasis transmit bite sandfly . It cause skin lesion may persist several month , spread part body , become infected bacteria . Treated medicine , leishmaniasis cure completely . People 1 year age older live Mali village Kemena Sougoula may eligible study . Participants inject small amount inactive parasite skin arm . People reaction test , thus expose parasite , examine skin lesion . Their lesion , , evaluate treat , participation study end . Participants react skin test examine skin lesion every month 5 month . Those 18 year age old mild leishmaniasis skin lesion may small amount fluid inject lesion order remove parasite laboratory analysis . Patients ' lesion may photograph compare look like treatment . Lesions treat ointment contain antibiotic disinfectant twice day 20 day . The lesion examine 1 3 week treatment complete see disease cure . A month later , skin test repeat determine whether person expose parasite past year . A blood sample may draw participant , depend whether reaction second skin test whether develop skin lesion . The sample drawn patient 18-65 year age . Some blood drawn study may use genetic test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overarch aim research program develop vaccine cutaneous leishmaniasis ( CL ) base sandfly salivary protein ( SFSPs ) . In order determine whether vaccination SFSPs reduce subsequent incidence Leishmania major infection CL human , first necessary establish baseline rate parasite infection disease . We select two rural village central Mali readily observe CL lesion individual age large number sandfly know transmit L. major West Africa . The main objective study estimate cross-sectional prevalence L. major exposure ; determine prevalence CL ; determine annual incidence rate L. major infection ; determine whether robust vitro T B cell response SFSPs correlate protection newly acquire L. major infection CL . To meet objective , standard leishmanin skin test ( LST ) administer resident two Malian village order identify cohort subject risk newly acquire L. major . After sandfly bite disease transmission season , subject examine development CL lesion every month 5 month total . CL lesion treat topically paromomycin- methylbenzethonium chloride ointment twice daily 20 day . Response therapy document day 28 42 protocol . After allow adequate time development delayed-type hypersensitivity response parasite antigen , LSTs re-administered subject . Conversion negative positive LST take evidence newly acquire L. major infection . LST conversion data clinical diagnosis CL lesion allow u calculate incidence new L. major infection CL study population . In vitro T B cell response SFSPs measure subset individual correlate relative resistance L. major infection development clinically apparent lesion .</detailed_description>
