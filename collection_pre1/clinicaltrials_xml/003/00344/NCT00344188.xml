	<brief_summary>This study examine natural history Leishmanial infection treatment . It provide opportunity NIAID staff learn leishmaniasis perhaps improve diagnostic test infection . Patients 2 80 year age know suspected leishmaniasis eligible study . Participants routine blood test biopsy confirm leishmanial infection . The biopsy procedure determine type infection local cutaneous leishmaniasis ( LCL ) , mucocutaneous leishmaniasis ( MCL ) visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) . CL confirm punch biopsy , cookie-cutter type razor use remove small circular piece skin tissue . MCL confirm use thin flexible tube insert nose . This tube use examine nose upper airway remove tissue sample , affect area see . VL confirm either bone marrow liver biopsy splenic aspirate . For procedure , small tissue sample withdrawn needle place hipbone , liver spleen , respectively . Some patient may also skin test leishmaniasis similar tuberculin skin test . Treatment length hospital stay determine type infection . CL may treat Pentostam , amphotericin , amphotericin B , itraconazole ketoconazole ; ML amphotericin B , encapsulate amphotericin ; VL Pentostam encapsulate amphotericin . Pentostam infuse daily 18 28 dos , outpatient . Blood drawn 3 time week safety test electrocardiogram do 2 3 time week monitor heart rhythm . Amphotericin B infuse every day every day 30 dos , inpatient basis . Patients undergo hydration ( infusion large amount fluid ) immediately infusion protect kidney . Blood drawn every day urine sample collect occasionally routine urinalysis . Encapsulated amphotericin infused every day , outpatient basis . Blood generally draw every day every 2 day urinalyses do periodically . Itraconazole ketoconazole take orally least 1 3 month , blood drawn every 2 3 week . Patients may ask photograph take , treatment document progress . They may also ask provide extra blood sample research purpose , either vein arm apheresis , method collect large number cell . For apheresis , whole blood collect needle arm vein circulate machine separate component . The desired cell remove , rest blood return body , either needle use draw blood second needle arm . Patients cutaneous leishmaniasis follow-up clinic visit 2 week 3 month treatment complete . If complication , participation end time . Patients mucocutaneous leishmaniasis visceral leishmaniasis follow every 3 6 month indefinitely routine evaluation re-treatment infection recurs .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The major objective protocol diagnose , obtain patient isolates , determine immune response host infection , provide treatment study natural history treat infection . Another objective provide training NIH medical staff . A number medication may use depend specie geographic origin infect Leishmanim potential sequela infection , health status patient , ease administration efficacy , morbidity toxicity medication . Miltefosine ( Impavido ) Ambsiome drug approve CDC treat cutaneous visceral leishmaniasis , respectively . Ketoconazole , fluconazole azoles well treatment readily available efficacy form infection . Pentostam , old drug commonly use previously available CDC IND . At NIH rarely employ .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Individuals either sex must age 2 80 year . Likely proven diagnosis leishmaniasis . Some patient suggestive history , exposed time diagnose patient suggestive lesion , convince history compatible histopathology . Weigh least 66 lb treat miltefosine . Agree use 2 method birth control ( pill barrier method abstinence ) delay pregnancy/fatherhood treatment 6 month treatment end treated miltefosine . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Individuals pregnant breast feeding , lifethreatening form disease , exclude protocol termination pregnancy ( birth otherwise ) . Those lifethreatening leishmaniasis offer treatment . Those refuse recommend treatment , evaluation , follow Presence life threaten illness non serious leishmaniasis When treatment best interest patient well Option treatment : Not patient leishmaniaisis require treatment patient infect Leishmania major , specie severe sequela . These may diagnose confirmed culture , PCR , histopathology NIH give option treatment treatment . Other patient heal lesion , discretion physician patient may require treatment .</criteria>
