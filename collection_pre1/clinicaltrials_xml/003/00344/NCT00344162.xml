	<brief_summary>This study examine possible genetic basis preeclampsia , disorder high blood pressure protein urine pregnancy . Preeclampsia major pregnancy complication affect mother baby . Previous research show preeclampsia tends run certain family . This study determine gene may involve preeclampsia . Women preeclampsia ( call index woman ) may eligible study . They recruit Preeclampsia Foundation . In addition , follow relative index woman may enrol : - The child preeclampsic pregnancy - The index woman 's biological parent - The index woman 's sibling give birth father child family member The study exclude index woman family member chronic hypertension , diabetes , polycystic ovary syndrome , whose pregnancy involve preeclampsia multiple fetus pregnancy conceive use fertility technology . All woman participant fill questionnaire collect demographic data ( e.g. , age , race , marital status , etc . ) information medical reproductive history , use tobacco medicine , factor may associate preeclampsia syndrome . Women preeclampsia hypertension pregnancy ask sign medical record release form study investigator obtain copy medical record pregnancy . All male female participant provide mouthwash rinse sample extraction DNA gene study . For baby young rinse mouthwash , soft brush use brush inside mouth collect cheek cell . Mouthwash sample analyze gene may associate preeclampsia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Family Study Preeclampsia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preeclampsia syndrome hypertension accompany proteinuria . It major pregnancy complication , associate premature delivery , fetal growth restriction , abruptio placenta , fetal death , well maternal morbidity mortality . Although preeclampsia recognize century , etiology disorder remain unknown . Familial cluster preeclampsia long identify , lead concept genetic basis syndrome . We propose familial genetic study preeclampsia . As study often difficult , plan conduct pilot study test feasibility , logistics examine frequency genetic polymorphism certain gene target population . A total 50 woman preeclampsia first pregnancy identify Preeclampsia Foundation . Women chronic hypertension diabetes prior first pregnancy exclude . We also try enroll family member study . All subject ask complete self-administered questionnaire collect mouth wash sample . Women report hypertension pregnancy ask sign medical record release form . A copy medical record obtain confirm diagnosis preeclampsia . DNA extract buccal cell . Frequency polymorphism number candidate gene ( e.g. , HLA-G , AGT , eNOS , MTHFR , IL-1 beta , TNF-alpha , Prothrombin , Factor V Leiden ) examine . Information experience gain pilot study valuable use plan main study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Women document severe preeclampsia eclampsia first pregnancy past 10 year potentially eligible study . Through index woman , invite biological parent , sibling give birth father child family member participate study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Excluded chronic hypertension , diabetes , polycystic ovary syndrome , index pregnancy multifetal gestation conceive assisted reproductive technology .</criteria>
