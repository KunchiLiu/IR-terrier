	<brief_title>A Two Year Study Clinical Efficacy Combination Emtricitabine , Tenofovir , Nevirapine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Description study design This open-labeled clinical trial evaluate antiretroviral treatment regimen drug demonstrate vitro activity , rest activate mononuclear cell . These drug include : FTC 200 mg p.o . qd , Tenofovir 300 mg p.o . qd , Nevirapine 200 mg b.i.d . Eligible patient must least 18 year age , refer primary HIV provider antiretroviral therapy patient self refer , CD4 cell count &lt; 250/mm3 viral load &gt; 5,000c/ml . Eligibility requirement woman must CD4 cell count &lt; 250 time enrollment . This cutoff woman base unpublished data may increase hepatotoxicity woman CD4 cell count &gt; 250 cell/mm3 . The screening evaluation take place day inform consent sign . During screen evaluation , patient undergo history physical examination , study lab draw . Within 60 day screen evaluation meeting eligible criterion , patient place study treatment regimen . Patients evaluate clinic Day 0 ( therapy initiation ) , week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 16 , every 8 week 48 week thereafter every 12 week week 96 . At end study , patient may continue current antiretroviral treatment regimen discretion patient primary care provider . Pharmacokinetic Analysis Sub Study A pharmacokinetic evaluation perform first 7 volunteer assess impact FTC Nevirapine vice versa . Pharmacokinetic analysis perform end week 2 ( day 14 ) 200mg qd start period . Samples obtain baseline 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 24 hour post Nevirapine dosing . Pharmacokinetic analysis repeat week 8 visit . Samples obtain baseline 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 24 hour post Nevirapine . Assignment patient There 60 patient involved clinical trial . This open-labeled study . There placebos involve study . Dose dose selection The dosage medication currently use standard clinical practice : Nevirapine 200 mg b.i.d . ( 1-200 mg tablet b.i.d . ) ; Emtricitabine ( FTC ) 200mg po qd . ( 1-200mg capsule ) ; Tenofovir 300 mg once-a-day ( 1-300 mg tablet qd ) . Justification study design All study patient require treatment HIV infection . All drug use study FDA-Approved . Tenofovir FTC approve once-a-day treatment medication . Nevirapine ( NVP ) approve BID dose . NOTE : That whenever Nevirapine prescribe , lead-in period 14 day Nevirapine prescribe 200 mg day follow 200 mg BID recommend standard care .</detailed_description>
