	<detailed_description>The purpose research compare on-eye performance 12 month daily wear versus 6-night extended wear 30-night extend wear novel hyper-oxygen permeable contact lenses bacterial bind corneal cell central epithelial thickness . Usual customary care give form eyeglasses contact lens . To compare long-term Daily wear vs. immediate Overnight wear ( Extended wear ) new hyper-oxygen permeable silicone hydrogel contact lens bind Pseudomonas Aeruginosa exfoliate human surface corneal cell collect eye human patient central corneal thickness , follow : 1 ) hyper Dk/t lens 12 month daily wear , 2 ) hyper Dk/t lens 12 month de novo 6 night extend wear , 3 ) hyper Dk/t lens 12 month de novo 30 night extend wear .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>The age requirement study 1838 year old . The subject nearsightedness 1.00D 6.00D regular astigmatism amount eye necessitate need toric lens . No prior history lens wear within one month entry contact lens phase study . Visual acuity 20/30 good test lens wear . Normal anatomy physiology eye . No eye cosmetic use day study visit . Normal appearance cornea slit lamp examination , stable tear film sufficient tear production . Intraocular pressure less equal 21 mmHg Goldmann applanation . Absence intraocular inflammation . Normal appearance optic nerve , macula peripheral retina direct fundus examination . Patients chronic ocular condition exclude study ( i.e . dry eye , recurrent corneal epithelial erosion ) . History allergic eye disease either seasonal associate previous contact lens wear . Use topically apply ocular medication systemic medication specifically include limit , antihistamine , aspirinrelated drug , psychoactive antidepressant medication . Oral contraceptive allow . Currently suspect actual pregnancy . Study terminate pregnancy occurs . Patients enrol currently another ophthalmic research project .</criteria>
