OUTCOME MEASURES : Primary outcome measure mean seizure frequency per 4 week tDCS group compare Sham-tDCS group . To analyze effect intervention ( tDCS ) , seizures evaluate 2x4 week baseline period tDCS 2x4 week intervention . Using data calculate percentage change seizures per 4 week .

Cathodal tDCS , current 1 mA , induce long-term depression animal model reportedly decrease excitability human animal cerebral cortex . In epilepsy patient suffer malformation cortical development , single session cathodal tDCS apply various cortical area include frontal temporal cortex help reduce seizure briefly . The purpose protocol study effect repeat application tDCS excitability seizure focus patient poorly control pharmacologically refractory frontal and/or temporal lobe epilepsy . STUDY POPULATION : We plan study 56 patient age 18 80 suffering frontal and/or temporal lobe epilepsy . DESIGN : Subjects allocate blocked randomization one two group ( parallel design ) . Group A receive cathodal tDCS group B receive Sham-tDCS five consecutive day . Each subject participate 9 session ( 1 baseline visit , 5 intervention visit , 3 follow-up visit ) .

Secondary outcome measure score neuropsychological testing ( HVLT-R , BVMT-R , CTMT , COWAT ) number epileptiform discharge EEG . Furthermore , patient answer several questionnaire evaluate quality life ( QOLIE-31-P ) , seizure severity ( SSQ ) , mood ( BDI ) . To good understand mechanism underlie propose change seizure frequency , use single- paired- pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) identify corticomotor excitability change .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients include follow circumstance : 1 . Age 18 80 year . 2 . Written informed consent give patient . 3 . Epileptogenic focus temporal lobe frontal lobe ( unilateral bilateral dominant focus ) . 4 . Seizures completely responsive medical treatment ( 8 seizure per month least 3 month ) patient fail least two anticonvulsant regimen past . The implantation vagus nerve stimulator also count anticonvulsant regimen . 5 . A stable anticonvulsant regimen ( three anticonvulsant ) define unchanged dose dose modification low 20 % last month ( Blood level anticonvulsant measure begin study , prior intervention , study assure type dose medication remain constant ) . For vagus nerve stimulator , stimulation parameter unchanged least one month . 6 . One antidepressant stable dose regimen least 1 month allow . 7 . MiniMentalStatus examination great equal 23 point . 8 . Commitment participate longterm followup ( 5 month ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : We exclude patient one follow condition applies : 1 . A history neurological illness epilepsy . 2 . Acute symptomatic seizure ( cause brain tumor , acute stroke , intracranial hemorrhage , encephalitis ) psychogenic seizure . 3 . Generalized epilepsy focal epilepsy epileptogenic zone outside temporal lobe . 4 . A history severe alcohol drug abuse ; psychiatric illness severe , clinically significant depression ( evaluated BDI ) ; poor motivational capacity ; severe language disturbance , particularly receptive nature serious cognitive deficit . 5 . More moderate uncontrolled medical problem ( e.g. , cardiovascular disease , active cancer renal disease , kind endstage pulmonary cardiovascular disease , hypo/hyperthyroidism , severe diabetes , peripheral arteriopathy , deteriorate condition due age , medical condition determine study physician , would interfere participation study ) . 6 . Increased intracranial pressure evaluate clinical mean ( presence papilledema eye ground exam , compress sulci/ventricle MRI scan ) . 7 . Previous implantation metallic material ( e.g. , vascular clip , cochlear implant ) cranium ( except mouth ) , pacemaker , implanted medication pump , neural stimulators . This apply implantation vagus nerve stimulator ( Cyberonics Â® ( Registered Trademark ) [ Registered Trademark ] 100 , 102 102R ) . 8 . Drug treatment act primarily central nervous system ( regular anticonvulsant treatment one antidepressant ) lower seizure threshold antipsychotic drug ( chlorpromazine , clozapine ) tricyclic antidepressant . 9 . Diseased damage skin face scalp . 10 . Pregnancy .</criteria>
