	<brief_title>The Effects Soy Protein Post-thoracotomy Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preclinical study indicate soy-containing diet suppress development pain behavior hyperalgesia see follow nerve injury recent data indicate similar protective effect diet high soy protein inflammatory bone cancer pain model . These study indicate soy exposure protective administered period immediately preceding injury . Very study directly study effect soy-containing diet pain sensitivity human , one recent randomize clinical trial suggest dietary soy supplementation may reduce pain due osteoarthritis . The propose study examine whether soy protein supplement reduces pain commonly experience follow thoracotomy lung surgery . This useful clinical model study effect soy protein supplementation pain pain associate surgery quite severe one great concern patient undergo surgery . The grow recognition great acute pain lead persistent pain follow tissue heal underscore importance identify viable strategy , include non-pharmacological well pharmacological , reduce acute pain associate surgery . Using 2 group ( soy protein supplementation vs. match milk placebo supplementation ) design , patient undergo elective major open thoracotomy segmentectomy , lobectomy , bilobectomy randomly assign one two treatment group . Patients begin take soy/placebo supplement 2-3 day prior thoracotomy continue daily consumption supplement additional period follow surgery . The feasibility/pilot study examine effect soy supplementation outcome measure three post-operative time period : 1 ) immediate post-operative period ; 2 ) 2-12 week follow surgery ; 3 ) 14-24 week follow surgery . Pain primary outcome domain interest pilot study measure include pain severity rating pain medication use . Function quality life secondary outcome domains interest measure include pain-related interference daily activity , sleep , health-related quality life . Outcome measure collect bi-weekly throughout study . The study aim determine feasibility acceptability soy supplementation period surround thoracotomy , determine level adherence soy supplementation 6-month period follow-up , estimate effect size soy supplementation relative placebo reduce significant pain follow thoracotomy . The propose study provide necessary groundwork move towards large randomize trial evaluate pain-reducing effect soy protein supplementation follow thoracotomy .</detailed_description>
