	<brief_summary>Tisseel fibrin adhesive use extensively many form surgery . Its use eye surgery relatively recent . A study recently show effective secure conjunctival graft pterygium surgery , secure wound glaucoma squint surgery . We seek confirm effectiveness pterygium surgery , well prove effectiveness secure material ocular surface amniotic membrane . Our hypothesis fibrin adhesive effective secure various type material ocular surface sufficient length time allow adequate healing absorb degrade .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>AIMS OF STUDY : This project seek evaluate efficacy fibrin glue ( Tisseel ) alternative conventional suture ocular surface reconstruction , include pterygium excision conjunctival autografting form conjunctival amniotic membrane surgery . It aim evaluate safety efficacy fibrin glue pterygium form ocular surface conjunctival amniotic membrane surgery , alternative conventional suturing . We perform conjunctival autografting 30 patient primary recurrent pterygium , addition , 20 patient undergo either conjunctival amniotic membrane ocular surface reconstruction variety diverse ocular surface disorder include persistent epithelial defect , Stevens Johnson syndrome , chemical thermal burn fornix shortening/symblepharon condition . Efficacy endpoint ability fibrin glue form stable adherence conjunctival/AM graft postoperatively , case pterygium , percentage pterygium recurrence 6 month follow surgery , subjective indication postoperative comfort/discomfort . Safety data include close monitoring potential side-effects include graft loss , infection , pain/discomfort , excessive ocular surface inflammation , epithelial breakdown , complication result visual loss . Patients charge fibrin glue . If successful , use fibrin glue useful adjunct ocular surface reconstruction , reduce time surgery suture-related complication discomfort . The cost-benefit ratio need examine , full-paying patient afford may offer fibrin glue pterygium surgery surgical option . Study Plan This non-randomized prospective series surgical case pterygium surgery ocular surface reconstruction viability efficacy fibrin glue replace augment suture evaluate . Patient Numbers Selection 1 . Pterygium case : Patients refer SNEC doctor Corneal Clinic study counsel enrolment . Up 30 case either primary recurrent pterygium require pterygium excision conjunctival autografting counsel study inclusion . The potential benefit risk use fibrin glue oppose conventional suture explain full informed consent . All surgery perform PI . 2 . Other ocular surface reconstruction : Up 20 case ocular surface reconstruction SNEC Corneal Clinic require suture conjunctival graft AM counsel study inclusion . Significant variation diagnosis indication exist ocular surface transplantation numerous elucidate , case generally include ocular surface fornix reconstruction follow symblepharon cicatrize disorder , chemical thermal burn , etc . The potential benefit risk use fibrin glue oppose conventional suture explain full informed consent . All surgery perform PI . All patient follow 1 day post-operatively , 1 week , 1 month , 3 month 6 month . Regular slit-lamp anterior segment photography detail record status graft perform . Procedures Data Collection The patient fully inform aim procedure study . The following data capture : 1 . Visual acuity standard Snellen chart 2 . Pterygium Grading ( T1-3 ) 3 . Documentation pterygium location , primary recurrent status 4 . Slit-lamp photography , pre- post-surgery 5. subjective assessment postoperative discomfort 6 . Practical benefit anticipate successfully complete project ( 1/2 page ) If successful , use fibrin glue useful adjunct ocular surface reconstruction , significantly reduce surgical time , obviate suture-related complication discomfort . The cost-benefit ratio need examine , full-paying patient afford may offer fibrin glue pterygium surgery surgical option . Up 3 consecutive case perform one Tisseel unit .</detailed_description>
