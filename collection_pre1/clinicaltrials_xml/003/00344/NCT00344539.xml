	<brief_summary>The purpose study test experimental malaria vaccine 75 healthy adult , 18-45 year age . The study also test experimental adjuvant material add vaccine help body make defense cell . The body 's immune response ( response foreign substance ) safety vaccine test . All subject receive 3 dos vaccine day 0 , 28 , 56 dos may increase study . Participation study expect 323 day include 16 visit . Study procedure include medical history , physical exam , urine blood testing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel + CpG 7909 Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I , dose escalate study evaluate safety immunogenicity experimental malaria vaccine AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel® , ability TLR-9 agonist CPG 7909 oligodeoxynucleotide ( ODN ) augment antibody responses vaccine alter Th1/Th2 bias . The vaccine preparation study contain equal mixture AMA1 two different clone Plasmodium falciparum ( FVO 3D7 ) . Subjects randomly assign receive Alydrogel® formulate vaccine without CPG 7909 point use formulation . The study conduct University Rochester Vaccine Treatment Evaluation Unit . Subjects study healthy adult age 18 45 year history malaria recent travel malaria-endemic area . Subjects enrol three consecutive dose-escalation cohort review Safety Monitoring Committee cohort . Subjects receive 3 vaccination AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel® vaccine formulate Alhydrogel® without CPG 7909 adjuvant 2 month ( 0 , 1 , 2 month ) intramuscular ( IM ) injection . Subjects multiple blood sample obtain next 6 month . The primary objective study ass safety , reactogenicity AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel® + CPG 7909 vaccine . The secondary objective study include follow : demonstrate addition CPG 7909 improve immune response AMA1-FVO AMA1-3D7 , compare AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel® day 70 ( 14 day 3rd vaccination ; determine dose AMA1-C1/Alhydrogel® + CPG 7909 generate high serum antibody level AMA-FVO AMA1-3D7 day 70 ; ass compare duration antibody responses AMA1-FVO AMA1-3D7 proteins enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) 8 month period ( 6 month 3rd vaccination ) ; perform exploratory study B T cell population vaccination . The safety trial endpoint include frequency severity local systemic adverse event dose report subject diary card ( solicited adverse event ) report subject spontaneously ( unsolicited adverse event ) presence abnormal clinical laboratory test immunization group . The immunogenicity endpoint include frequency titer vaccine induce neutralize bind antibody , presence quantity antigen-specific B cell CD4 CD8 T cell produce specify cytokine follow vaccination .</detailed_description>
