	<brief_summary>High order aberration ( HOA ) visual phenomenon decrease quality vision . Examples high order aberration glare , halo , decrease contrast sensitivity shape distortion . They cause slight imperfection distortion corneal surface . HOA currently measure use variety FDA approve device . For study , LADARWave ( Alcon ) use measure HOA . This device use harmless beam light . It FDA approve non-invasive . Contact lens induce high order aberration never measure report literature . This work may provide information guide future contact lens design .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Clinical Research Project Evaluating The Effects Soft Contact Lenses Higher Order Visual Aberrations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients recruit Aston optometry clinic . The pool patient include study voluntarily schedule appointment contact lens . During patient 's initial visit , study explain choice whether take part penalty refusal . If patient agrees take part study , HOA measure LADARWave instrument prior contact lens insertion right contact lens insertion . Patients return visit one week one month later follow measurement time regularly schedule visit .</detailed_description>
