	<brief_summary>To investigate effect use tissue culture human amniotic epithelial cell re-establish severely damage ocular surface . Specifically , determine efficacy transplanted tissue culture amniotic epithelial cell persistent corneal epithelial defect , potential visual threaten ocular disorder .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transplantation Tissue Cultured Human Amniotic Epithelial Cells Onto Damaged Ocular Surfaces</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ocular surface disease injury cause chemical , result chronic ulceration , may never able heal normally , may lead permanent vision loss . Standard medical treatment often fail . Histologically somehow functionally , human amniotic cell similar ocular surface cell , cell show safe transplant another subject reject recipient . In animal study , amniotic cell demonstrate re-establish integrity ocular surface 30 % recipient without apparent toxic side effect . This study investigate novel strategy effect human ocular surface disorder . It provide potential alternative therapy difficult devastating disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients corneal epithelial defect ulcer persist 4 week longer , regardless cause . These patient receive traditional medical therapy , include correct underlying cause , suppress inflammation , augment tissue healing process , epithelial defect persist . Patients pregnant age 18 exclude . Placentas use follow problem present : If mother infection time baby 's birth ; If mother high risk develop infection due intravenous drug use factor ; If mother diabetes , arthritis , raise blood pressure ; If baby unhealthy ; If evidence infection womb ( uterus ) afterbirth ( placenta ) time delivery .</criteria>
