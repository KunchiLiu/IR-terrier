	<brief_title>Physical Activity Breast Cancer Risk Postmenopausal Women : SHAPE Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physical activity associate decrease risk breast cancer . The biological mechanism ( ) underlie association physical activity breast cancer clear . Most prominent hypothesis physical activity may protect breast cancer reduce lifetime exposure endogenous hormone . Another hypothesis physical activity prevents overweight abdominal adiposity . In intervention study , 189 sedentary postmenopausal woman age 50-69 year randomly allocate intervention control group . The intervention consist 1-year moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic strength training exercise programme . Participants allocate control group request retain habitual exercise pattern . Primary study parameter measure baseline , four month 12 month : serum concentration endogenous estrogen , endogenous androgen , sex hormone bind globulin insulin . Other study parameter include : amount total abdominal fat , weight , BMI , body fat distribution , physical fitness , blood pressure lifestyle factor . This study contribute body evidence relate physical activity breast cancer risk provide insight possible mechanisms physical activity might associate reduce risk breast cancer postmenopausal woman .</detailed_description>
