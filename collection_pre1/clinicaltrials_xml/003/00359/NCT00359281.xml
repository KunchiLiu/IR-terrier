	<detailed_description>Objectives : Primary : To evaluate effect low high dos AEGR-733 pharmacokinetics 6 FDA-approved medication likely use combination AEGR-733 assess : â€¢ Pharmacokinetic parameter : Cmax , Tmax , T1/2 , AUC ( area curve ) . Secondary : To evaluate safety AEGR-733 combination lipid lower agent healthy subject assess : - Changes associate liver enzymes AST , ALT , Alkaline Phosphatase , &amp; Total Bilirubin . - Changes report adverse event . - To evaluate effect AEGR-733 combination lipid lower agent follow lipid lipoprotein : TC , LDL-C , VLDL , TG , HDL-C , ApoB ApoAI . 4.0 STUDY DESIGN AND RATIONALE 4.1 STUDY DESIGN This single-center , phase II , clinical trial consist eight ( 8 ) day open-label phase assess pharmacokinetic drug interaction AEGR-733 6 probe drug healthy volunteer , follow one week safety visit . 105 subject enrol fixed-sequenced research study . Eligible subject base screen visit come GCRC inpatient visit ( 25-36 hr depend come evening study day 1 morning ) . On morning study day 1 , subject assign one 6 probe drug ( A-H ) take one dose medication . Timed blood sample draw administration probe drug follow time drug administration ( 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,18 , 24 hr ) . Prior discharge 24 h blood sample , subject take oral dose AEGR-733 10 mg 60 mg . Subjects give 5 day supply AEGR-733 10 mg 60 mg take daily morning next 5 day ( day 7 ) . On study day 8 , subject take final dose AEGR-733 10 mg 60 mg ( total doses= 7 ) simultaneously probe drug take day 1 . Timed blood sample draw administration probe drug AEGR-733 well 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12,18 , 24 hour study drug administration . After 24 hour blood sample , subject discharge . 15 subject participate study receive dextromethorphan probe drug , require urine collection 8 hour post dose . Blood pharmacokinetic sample collect subject . Subjects receive dextromethorphan may leave 8 hour urine collection visit 2 3 ( refer inpatient visit ) . All subject come back 1 week later final visit check safety lab parameter include liver transaminase total bilirubin . Subjects instruct abstain drink alcoholic beverage screen study completion . Subjects willing comply request enrol . The FDA-approved lipid-lowering therapy include : A ) Atorvastatin , 20 mg ( n=15 ) AEGR-733 10 mg B ) Ezetimibe , 10 mg ( n=10 ) AEGR-733 10 mg C ) Simvastatin , 20 mg ( n=15 ) AEGR-733 10 mg D ) Rosuvastatin , 20 mg ( n=10 ) AEGR-733 10 mg E ) Micronized fenofibrate , 145 mg ( n=10 ) AEGR-733 10 mg F ) Atorvastatin , 20 mg ( n=15 ) AEGR-733 60 mg G ) Rosuvastatin , 20 mg ( n=15 ) AEGR-733 60 mg H ) Dextromethorphan , 30 mg ( n=15 ) AEGR-733 60 mg I ) Extended Release Niacin , 1000 mg ( n=20 ) AEGR-733 10 mg</detailed_description>
