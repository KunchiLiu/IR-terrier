	<brief_summary>Cystinosis inherit disease result poor growth kidney failure . There known cure cystinosis , although kidney transplantation may help renal failure prolong survival . Both kidney damage growth failure think due accumulation amino acid cystine within cell body . The cystine storage later damage organ besides kidney , include thyroid gland , pancreas , eye , muscle . The drug cysteamine ( Cystagon ) oral medication give patient cystinosis prior kidney transplantation . The drug work reduce level cystine white blood cell muscle tissue . The drug may also decrease level cystine kidney tissue . This study several goal : 1 . &lt; TAB &gt; Long-term surveillance cysteamine ( Cystagon ) treat patient . 2 . &lt; TAB &gt; Detection new non-kidney complication cystinosis . 3 . &lt; TAB &gt; Maintenance patient population genetic testing ( mutational analysis ) cystinosis gene. &lt; TAB &gt;</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Cysteamine Treatment Cystinosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients nephropathic cystinosis treat cystine-depleting agent cysteamine since 1978 . This therapy prevent delay renal deterioration , improve growth , deplete parenchymal tissue cystine . Based largely upon data produce protocol , Food Drug Administration approve cysteamine bitartrate use cystinosis patient August 15 , 1994 . Cysteamine available CystagonR Mylan Pharmaceuticals 50 mg 150 mg capsule ProcysbiR 75 mg capsule . By virtue current protocol , patient admit NIH Clinical Center investigation every two year , except case great interest urgency . On 1-3 day admission , battery test perform adequacy cystine depletion cysteamine monitor . This protocol demonstrate course cystinosis patient treat cysteamine , describe new complication disorder poorly treat adult , maintain NHGRI expertise field . Its monitoring followup patient course 3 decade represent invaluable contribution understand natural history rare disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Diagnosis cystinosis , whether classical one variant later onset renal complication . Patients diagnose cystinosis base upon leucocyte cystine content great 1 nmol halfcystine/mg protein ( normal , less 0.2 ) typical clinical course . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Inability travel NIH . Age le one week .</criteria>
