	<brief_title>Randomized Trial Assess Impact Screening Program Upper Aerodigestive Tract Cancer Mortality High Risk Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Upper aerodigestive tract ( UADT ) carcinoma ( oral cavity pharynx ( 63 % ) , larynx ( 17 % ) esophagus ( 20 % ) ) , frequent France 25.000 new case annually estimated 2000 , represent 13 % men cancer ( 3rd rank ) . Five-year specific survival rate approximately 50 % ( 11.000 death per year ) improve three decade , primarily due advanced stage presentation . UADT cancer also associate profound disease- treatment-related morbidity , alteration speech feed function , aesthetic disability , familial social consequence . The high-risk population well characterize . A synergistic effect tobacco smoking alcohol drinking increase risk develop carcinoma 100 fold . Each year , 30.000 alcohol drinker treat alcohol addiction clinic could benefit cancer detection . Nonrandomized pilot study show UADT cancer screen trial could undertake clinic . Study design : prospective randomize trial compare observation group screen group . Subjects screen group undergo annual screen test include head neck clinical examination fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopy oesopharyngeal brush biopsy cytological examination 3-years period . In case positive test , patient undergo head neck panendoscopy and/or digestive flexible endoscopy and/or biopsy . After screen period , subject follow 2 additional year annual health questionnaire . Subjects observation group follow 5 year annual health questionnaire . Recruitment perform alcohol addiction clinic screen test confirmation exams close specialized head neck clinic . The primary objective demonstrate decrease UADT cancer mortality screen strategy , include head neck clinical examination fiberoptic nasolaryngoscopy oesopharyngeal brush biopsy cytological examination repeat annually 3 year . Subjects follow 5 year . A sample size 10.000 subject group allow detection 33 % reduction specific mortality rate , power 80 % one side a-risk 5 % .</detailed_description>
