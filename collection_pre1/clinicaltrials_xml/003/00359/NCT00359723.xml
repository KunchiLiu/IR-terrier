	<brief_title>Methylphenidate Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) common disorder cause loss dopamine-producing brain cell . The disorder generally treat levodopa combine carbidopa . Nerve cell use levodopa make dopamine . Carbidopa delay conversion levodopa dopamine reach brain . Motor fluctuation ( wear effect levodopa characterize sometimes rapid change uncontrolled normal movement ) common , often difficult manage , source disability people PD . In trial researcher study effect methylphenidate ( MPD ) , also know Ritalin—a drug market U.S. treat hyperactivity narcolepsy—on carbidopa/levodopa antiparkinson medication take orally individual Parkinson 's disease experience motor fluctuation take levodopa . The overall goal project develop well symptomatic therapy PD . After 2 screen visit treatment clinic evaluate wear `` '' `` '' effect levodopa , eligible participant schedule 3 admission General Clinical Research Center Oregon Health &amp; Science University randomly receive study drug , MPD , placebo , along usual carbidopa/levodopa therapy and/or antiparkinson medication . Also , participant parkinsonism ( tremor , rigidity , postural instability , bradykinesia ) rat blood pressure pulse measure regular interval . Duration study participant 3 week include 2 outpatient clinic visit ( screen ) 3 inpatient clinic visit ( overnight stay ) .</detailed_description>
