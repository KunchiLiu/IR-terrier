	<brief_title>Sildenafil Study Treat Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ( IPF ) recognize predominantly noninflammatory paradigm lung fibrosis , characterize heterogeneous myofibroblast proliferation ( usual interstitial pneumonia [ UIP ] ) poor clinical prognosis . To date therapy demonstrate well-designed , randomize , control trial ( RCT ) favorably influence functional status survival IPF patient . The need effective therapy VA patient IPF thus obvious urgent . The overall goal VA Merit Review clinical research generate rigorous preliminary data evaluation new potentially effective therapy IPF . The establish , combine Miami Veterans Affairs Medical Center ( VAMC ) - University Miami ( UM ) IPF program participate productively number clinical trial assess new agent therapy IPF ( e.g. , interferon gamma-lb , imatinib mesylate , etanercept , bosentan ) . Our program uniquely qualify enroll large number IPF patient clinical trial , large metropolitan population base ( &gt; 5,000,000 people ) extensive referral network throughout South Central America . The Veteran population South Florida ( Dade , Broward Monroe Counties ) approximately 236,000 ( U.S. Census Bureau ) . Of number 39 % 65 year age old , make high risk IPF . Because large Veteran civilian population base , international referral network previous experience `` high enrollment center '' IPF clinical trial , Miami VAMC-UM IPF program uniquely qualified anticipate role CSP lead center . Our central hypothesis sildenafil , vasodilator , beneficial effect compare placebo disease progression , define significant change 6-minute walk distance dyspnea index , patient IPF . Specifically , test effect sildenafil IPF patient ' exercise tolerance level dyspnea double blind , randomize , placebo control ( one one assignment ) pilot study . Upon completion trial , possible ass efficacy sildenafil progression disease IPF possibly introduce agent translational practice . Our specific objective : Specific Objectives 1 : To assess possible therapeutic benefit vasodilator , sildenafil , exercise tolerance IPF patient . The working hypothesis , compare placebo , sildenafil favorably affect rate decline baseline exercise capacity ( 6-minutes walk ) . Specific Objective 2 : To assess compare change baseline pre- post-exercise dyspnea sildenafil placebo control group . The work hypothesis application agent lead sustain exercise favorable clinical outcome addition decrease degree limit dyspnea exercise . The application vasodilator therapy IPF unique directly target key pathophysiologic mechanism functional limitation : Increased pulmonary vascular resistance dyspnea due exercise . This novel approach significant impact field , promise additional insight mechanism disease immediate therapeutic option .</detailed_description>
