	<brief_summary>This study try identify new know virus responsible disease condition unknown cause . Viruses important cause illness . They identify cause several cancer , include certain liver cancer cervical cancer . Several disease , Kawasaki disease , aplastic anemia , aphthous ulcer , certain fever unknown origin immune suppress patient think possibly due virus , cause yet determine . This study use sensitive molecular technique try identify new know virus patient condition unknown cause . This study involve treatment . Any patient condition disease whose cause unknown may eligible study . A referral local physician require patient wish enroll study . Participants blood sample draw four time study . The total amount blood draw 6-week period exceed 50 milliliter ( 3-1/2 tablespoon ) adults 5 ml ( 1/2 tablespoon ) per kilogram ( 2.2 pound ) child . In addition , body fluid , joint spinal fluid , tissue sample , biopsy specimen , obtain previously medical purpose , may obtain test . The patient doctor inform positive finding sample . Identification virus necessarily mean virus cause patient condition disease . Additional test many patient similar disease condition require virus definitively associated disease . Similarly , failure find virus necessarily mean patient infect virus cause condition , test use study imperfect detect certain form virus cause disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Viral infection important cause morbidity mortality hospitalize patient . Viruses also identify probable cause number malignancy include hepatocellular carcinoma cervical carcinoma . The purpose study identify novel virus ( know virus ) associate disease whose etiology unknown . Blood sample , body fluid , discard tissue ( e.g . previous biopsy autopsy material ) saliva swab , nasopharyngeal swab , skin biopsy , mucosal biopsy obtain patient clinical syndrome disease whose etiology unknown . Highly sensitive assay use polymerase chain reaction perform attempt identify novel know virus might present blood , body fluid , tissue . Knowledge gain study could provide important insight cause disease whose etiology presently unknown .</detailed_description>
