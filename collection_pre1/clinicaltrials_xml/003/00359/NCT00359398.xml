	<brief_summary>Excessive bleeding common cardiac surgery . This may result patient receive blood transfusion suffer life-threatening complication cardiac tamponade . Tamponade excessive bleeding compress heart prevent pump properly . A major reason bleed damage do platelet cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) machine . Often patient receive platelet plasma blood donor try reduce bleed post-operatively . The investigator plan take platelet plasma patient damage . They would return 'undamaged ' sequestered platelet patient bypass machine longer need . Therefore , investigator ' primary question whether platelet sequestration would reduce bleed problem occur follow cardiac surgery . They evaluate bleed problem use thromboelastography , provide comprehensive assessment blood clot form strength . If sequestration reduces bleed problem follow cardiac surgery may reduce chance patient receive blood product donor . Although donated blood thoroughly test , use expose patient risk transfusion error , blood borne infection reaction . Avoiding use would desirable .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sequestration Platelets Prior Bypass Reduces Bleeding After Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : Patients undergo repeat median sternotomy require prolonged cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) often develop coagulopathy end surgery . We propose sequester plasma platelet patient prior CPB thus prior dilution platelet damage occur CPB . We hypothesise plasma platelet store properly CPB , administered end operation , reduce coagulopathy associate bleeding . Study population : Patients undergo repeat median sternotomy , mitral valve repair , double valve operation , aortic surgery , combine valve coronary artery surgery . Exclusion criterion include anaemia , thrombocytopenia , unstable angina , anti-platelet therapy within previous seven day , know symptomatic cerebrovascular disease , know disorder haemostasis , aprotinin sensitivity pregnancy . Intervention : Patients randomise closed envelope technique receive platelet/plasma sequestration . Patients randomise undergo sequestration 14 mL/Kg blood take . The blood separate red cell platelets/plasma . Anaemia would prevent return process red blood cell patient . We store platelet 20-24Â°C/room temperature platelet rocker accord guideline National Blood Service . Assessment coagulation : Patients ' coagulation status evaluate surgery . Four method employ comprehensively assess coagulation system : platelet count conventional clot study ; heparin level ; thromboelastography ; platelet function analyser .</detailed_description>
