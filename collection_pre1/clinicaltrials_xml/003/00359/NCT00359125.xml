	<detailed_description>Detailed Description : This study parallel design randomize control trial . Duration study 10 week per subject . Following baseline assessment neurocognitive performance , mood symptom , neuroendocrine functioning ( HPA axis function ) , bipolar depress outpatient ( n=100 ) randomize ( week 0 ) receive either mifepristone 600 mg daily ( n=50 ) match placebo ( n=50 ) 7 day . Outcome measure complete baseline ( pre-medication ) , time anticipate main response ( week 3 , i.e . 2 week cessation treatment ) , week 8 ( determine persistence effect ) . Neurocognitive performance ( pre post mifepristone treatment ) evaluate test previously show affected corticosteroid abnormal bipolar disorder . The neurocognitive battery measure learn memory , attention , executive functioning , facial expression ( show sensitive measure affective shift ) . Mood symptom evaluate every study visit use standard clinician patient self-rated scale . Neuroendocrine functioning ( HPA axis function ) measure dexamethasone suppression test ( DST ) response dexamethasone . This measure function glucocorticoid receptor . Subjects also ask salivary sample measure cortisol response waken ratio cortisol protective steroid DHEA . These validated test use improve understand mechanism therapeutic effect mifepristone . Fifty ( 50 ) matched-healthy control also undergo baseline assessment neurocognitive performance , mood symptom , neuroendocrine functioning . They provide information pathophysiology bipolar disorder .</detailed_description>
