	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) 5-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine ( 5-fluoro-2-deoxycytidine ) ( FdCyd ) administer intravenous ( IV ) infusion three hour concomitant infusion 350 mg/m2 tetrahydrouridine ( THU ) . II . To describe toxicity FdCyd co-infused THU . III . To obtain preliminary evidence anti-tumor activity patient treat combination . IV . To evaluate pharmacokinetics FdCyd THU co-infused . V. To evaluate oral bioavailability FdCyd co-administered THU . VI . When feasible , measure relative level messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) 's thymidylate synthase , deoxycytidine kinase , deoxycytidylate ( dCMP ) deaminase relevant enzyme ; methylation status p16 gene relevant neoplasia . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study 5-fluoro-2-deoxycytidine . Patients receive tetrahydrouridine orally ( PO ) day 1 ; 5-fluoro-2-deoxycytidine PO day 1 8 ; tetrahydrouridine IV 3 hour day 2-5 , 8 , 9-12 ; 5-fluoro-2-deoxycytidine IV 3 hour day 2-5 9-12 course 1 . For subsequent course , patient receive tetrahydrouridine IV 3 hour 5-fluoro-2-deoxycytidine IV 3 hour day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
