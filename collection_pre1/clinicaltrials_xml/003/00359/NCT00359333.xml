	<brief_summary>Study Design Type Study This open-label , single arm , prospective , multiple-center phase II study Duration Study Period One Subject Treatment duration plan six cycle , unless evidence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients continue response six cycle could receive two additional cycle therapy . In case complete response absence unacceptable toxicity , treatment continue least 2 cycle achieve minimal 6 total cycle . Study Objectives Primary Objective The primary objective determine response rate sequential gemcitabine docetaxel combination patient locally advanced/metastatic soft tissue sarcoma imatinib mesylate refractory GIST . Secondary Objectives The secondary objective study determine time progression patient treat regimen , toxicity regimen patient , overall survival quality life . Molecular analysis genetic aberration soft tissue sarcoma The genetic aberration soft tissue sarcoma report literature determine . The genetic aberration correlate chemotherapy response . c-kit PDGFR gene mutation induce imatinib mesylate chemotherapy Those acquire gene mutation c-kit PGDFR induce imatinib mesylate first determine . We also examine gene mutation c-kit PGDFR cause combination chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Locally Advanced/Metastatic Soft Tissue Sarcoma Advanced/Metastatic Malignant GIST</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligibility Criteria : Inclusion criterion : Patients must histologically confirm diagnosis ( 1 ) locally advance unresectable metastatic soft tissue sarcoma ; ( 2 ) unresectable/metastatic GIST previously treat imatinib mesylate document drug resistance imatinib mesylate treatment define tumor progression . Age great equal 18 year young equal 70 year old . Measurable disease : defined lesion measure least one dimension physical examination medical imaging technique . Ascites , pleural effusion , bone marrow disease consider measurable disease . Patients must ECOG performance status less equal 2 . Patients must recover ( define toxicity less grade 2 ) toxic effect prior therapy enter onto study . A treatment drug free interval least 4 week since last dose chemotherapy imatinib mesylate therapy require . More 4 week since prior radiotherapy require . Adequate bone marrow function ANC great equal 1,500/ml , platelet count great equal 100,000/ ml ( transfusion independent ) hemoglobin great equal 8.0 g/dl ( transfusion permit ) . Patients must adequate renal function serum creatinine less equal 1.5 mg/dl . Patients must adequate liver function , define bilirubin within 1.5 time upper limit normal , liver transaminase within 2.5 time upper limit normal . All patient must sign document inform consent indicate awareness investigational nature risk study . Exclusion criterion : Patients prior treatment gemcitabine taxane . Pregnant breast feeding female . Active uncontrolled infection . Patients brain leptomeningeal metastasis . Treatment Plan : For safety convenience drug administration , Port-A catheter implantation require start first chemotherapy course . Gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 administer intravenous infusion 80 minute day 1 day8 , docetaxel 60 mg/m2 60 minute day 1 21-day cycle . After first cycle chemotherapy , ANC patient always ≥ 1500/ml start next cycle , dosage docetaxel escalate 75 mg/m2 day 1 next following cycle . All patient receive filgrastim 300 mg subcutaneously per day day 12 15 . During treatment , complete blood cell count perform weekly . History physical examination assessment toxicity perform cycle treatment . Patients progressive disease evaluate third sixth course suggest salvage treatment withdrawn protocol treatment . Patients SD , CR , PR continue study undergo repeat CT scan cycle 6 . Patients continue response sixth course give two additional course chemotherapy , undergo CT scan cycle 8 . Dose Adjustments : dose adjustment require following situation : If patient experience febrile neutropenia platelet count le 25,000/ml lasting 5 day , dos gemcitabine docetaxel reduce 75 % previous dose subsequent cycle . If day 1 treatment cycle ANC le 1,500/ml platelet count less 50,000/ml , treatment delay 1 week . Patients ANC platelet count recover 2-week delay remove study . If day 8 ANC 500 999/ul platelet ≥ 50,000/ul , gemcitabine provide 75 % day 1 dos . If day 8 ANC less 500/ul platelet count less 50,000/ul , gemcitabine day 8 dose provide cycle . If patient experience grade 3 4 neurotoxicity , treatment delay 1 week . If neurotoxicity resolve ≤ grade 2 , treatment resume docetaxel dose decrease 75 % previous dose subsequent cycle . If patient 's bilirubin level 1.5 mg/dL , docetaxel treatment hold cycle . If bilirubin return ≤ 1.5 mg/dL , docetaxel treatment resume subsequent cycle . If patient experience grade 3 4 nonhematologic toxicity ( except alopecia ) , treatment hold 2 week ; treatment resume nonhematologic toxicity resolve ≤ grade 2 . Criteria Withdrawal Study Documented disease progression . A new cycle chemotherapy give ANC ≥ 1500/ml , platelet count ≥ 50,000/ ml ( transfusion independent ) hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dl ( transfusion permit ) . On scheduled Day 1 new treatment cycle , hemogram yet recover , chemotherapy postpone patient follow weekly resolution toxicity . If interruption 2 week schedule Day 1 , patient take protocol treatment . Occurrence adverse event attend physician considers withdrawal protocol treatment patient 's optimal benefit . Voluntary withdrawal .</detailed_description>
