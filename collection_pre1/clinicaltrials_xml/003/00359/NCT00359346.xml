	<brief_summary>This study explore whether antibody influence autonomic nervous system , removal eliminate sign symptom failure system . The autonomic nervous system responsible many automatic change involve everyday activity , stand , digest food , exercise heat . Antibodies fight germ sometimes cause health problem . Removal antibody do procedure call plasma exchange . Patients primary chronic autonomic failure circulate antibody call neuronal nicotinic receptor may eligible study . To eligible , patient participate earlier study , protocol number 03-N-0004 . Patients undergo test procedure include electrocardiogram , blood collection hepatitis , HIV , pregnancy . Blood test complete blood count , clot factor , chemistry . There also test liver function , kidney function , cortisol , thyroid . Participants test sign symptom autonomic failure , ask complete questionnaire various symptom plasma exchange , 1 2 week afterward , monthly bimonthly 1 year . Patients undergo series test . In one test , patient upright blow resistance ( Valsalva maneuver ) . The quantitative sudomotor axon reflex test ( QSART ) use iontophoresis , involve application acetylcholine , chemical messenger , small amount electricity . QSART examine regulation sweating , particular aspect autonomic nervous system . There test use edrophonium , give intravenously ( IV ) , evaluate drug 's effect heart , skin , gland , gastrointestinal activity , bladder tone , salivation . A glucagon test , also IV , show patient ' ability release hormone adrenaline . The plasma exchange perform use automate cell separator . Patients ' blood remove continuously needle arm . Blood cell separate plasma spin process continuously return circulation needle patient ' opposite arm . Blood cell return mixed albumin , sterile replacement solution . A blood thinner , citrate , give , prevent clot blood . This whole procedure take 2 hour . Patients typically undergo five exchange procedure 10 day inpatient NIH Clinical Center . The amount plasma remove single session number session set NIH Blood Bank . It expect patient ' autonomic failure improve several day start plasma exchange . Testing symptom autonomic failure autonomic function test occur 1 month plasma exchange monthly bimonthly 1 year . For visit testing , patient inpatient 2 day . If autonomic failure recurs , patient may second plasma exchange , follow-up test , 1 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Until recently , think primary chronic autonomic failure occur without central neurodegeneration ( pure autonomic failure , PAF ) reflect diffuse loss catecholamine-producing cell ( sympathetic noradrenergic nerve adrenomedullary chromaffin cell ) outside brain . Rarely , however , PAF patient clinical laboratory finding suggest decrease post-ganglionic nerve traffic intact autonomic nerve , rather denervation . To date , four patient also high titer circulate antibody nicotinic receptor mediate ganglionic neurotransmission . In one case , study another group , plasma exchange reversed sign symptom autonomic failure , consistent antibody pathogenic . Purpose : In Protocol , carry plasma exchange patient identify PAF , intact cardiac noradrenergic innervation , circulate antibody neuronal nicotinic receptor , determine whether antibody pathogenicity consistent find condition . We assess extent relationship symptom , sign , clinical laboratory index autonomic function titer antibody obtain abundant plasma antibody characterization target protein identification . Methods : Autonomic function test do plasma exchange , 1-2 week plasma exchange , monthly bi-monthly thereafter one year . Plasma exchange may repeat , symptom autonomic failure return antibody level build , verify individual patient whether repetition plasma exchange produce reproducible amelioration clinical laboratory measure autonomic failure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : The subject primary chronic autonomic failure , intact cardiac sympathetic innervation , circulate antibody nicotinic cholinergic receptor mediate ganglionic neurotransmission . This triad identify base result participation NIH Clinical Protocol 03N0004 . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects exclude meet three Inclusion Criteria . Venous Access Candidate subject exclude inadequate peripheral venous access , identify participation NIH Clinical Protocol 03N0004 . Abnormal Clinical Pathology Test Results Candidate subject exclude base abnormal Clinical Pathology result identify participation NIH Clinical Protocol 03N0004 ( platelet count le 100,000 per microliter , HIV1 2 chronic hepatitis B C infection , pregnancy ) . Medical Risk Candidate subject exclude safety reason , opinion Associate Investigator NIH Department Transfusion Medicine ( DTM ) , therapeutic plasma exchange would pose excessive risk complication ( e.g. , stroke , hemorrhage , infection ) outweigh potential scientific clinical benefit . In female patient childbearing potential , blood test pregnancy do prior test visit . The finding positive test pregnancy exclude patient participation . Patients autonomic failure increase risk hypotension response manipulation decrease venous return heart , plasma exchange . Patients autonomic failure typically also high blood pressure lie . We expect begin plasma exchange , blood pressure relatively high , plasma exchange may start patient sit position . The Principal Investigator one Associate Investigators Clinical Neurocardiology Section monitor blood pressure frequently continuously plasma exchange . Patients autonomic failure often tolerate remarkably low blood pressure . A systolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg threshold intervene . The first intervention place patient supine position . Second , would administer saline albumin slow rate stop plasma exchange . Drugs control blood pressure also hand immediate emergency use need . If think prevent low blood pressure faint future plasma exchange , would exclude patient plasma exchange Protocol . If uncontrollable hypotension occur second patient , Protocol terminate . Patients test hepatitis HIV undergo plasma exchange . Blood people hepatitis HIV contaminate Blood Bank equipment . If subject hepatitis HIV , subject exclude participation study . The Consent Form include standard consent language HIV testing . Age The Protocol restrict subject least 18 year old . Medications Medications likely interfere scientific result discontinue inpatient basis . Termination Participation A subject may refuse certain test procedure , may terminate participation early , without loss benefit subject previously entitle . The Investigators may also exclude subject participation , event know suspect falsification medical history information refusal undergo plan test procedure , without loss benefit subject previously entitle .</criteria>
