	<brief_title>A Randomized Trial Two Surgical Techniques Pancreaticojejunostomy Patients Undergoing Pancreaticoduodenectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreaticoduodenectomy ( PD ) commonly perform operative procedure use select patient benign malignant disease pancreas periampullary region . The procedure involve regional resection pancreatic head , neck , uncinate process en-bloc duodenum , distal bile duct , lymph node . The standard 'Whipple ' operation also add distal gastrectomy procedure , pylorus-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy ( PPPD ) spar distal stomach . The indication PD include neoplastic process confine periampullary region , pancreatic cancer , distal common bile duct cancer , duodenal cancer , ampullary cancer , neuroendocrine tumor , cystic tumor , etc . A small number benign condition , chronic pancreatitis benign neoplasm also treat PD . Upon completion pancreatic resection , 3 anastomosis use re-establish GI continuity—a pancreatic-enteric anastomosis , biliary-enteric anastomosis , gastro duodeno-enteric anastomosis . The pancreatic-enteric anastomosis traditionally troubling anastomosis failure heal resultant fistula leak . The operative mortality rate PD usually less 5 % major surgical center significant experience procedure . The leading cause mortality include hemorrhage , cardiac event , sepsis ( often relate pancreatic-enteric fistula ) . In contrast low mortality rate , morbidity rate still quite high one review show rate 40 % . One common cause morbidity leak pancreatic fistula pancreatic-enteric anastomosis . A recent review estimate incidence complication 10 % 28.5 % . A pancreatic fistula currently define International Study Group Pancreatic Fistulas ( ISGPF ) drain amylase level ≥3 time normal amylase level third postoperative day onward , drain output ≥ 10ml , color drain fluid alter ( non-serous ) . Several large single institution series Mannheim , Lahey , Mayo Clinics show leak rate 11-15 % . The Mannheim Clinic series demonstrate 20 % pancreatic fistula directly responsible postoperative death . There several randomize prospective trial investigator Johns Hopkins Hospital test various intervention attempt improve leakage rate . In one trial , determine leak rate similar ( 11-12 % ) whether pancreatic-enteric anastomosis pancreaticojejunostomy ( PJ ) pancreaticogastrostomy ( PG ) . In another trial , investigator evaluate use prophylactic octreotide agent reduce pancreatic fistula rates—in study decrease fistula rate use octreotide . Finally , author recently perform randomize , prospective trial stenting pancreatic-enteric anastomosis . In trial , fistula rate change placement perioperative stent across anastomosis . There two widely use method PJ reconstruction PD—invagination 'dunking ' pancreatic remnant end-to-side duct-to-mucosa PJ . In invagination technique , cut end pancreas sew open side jejunum use two layer suture—an out layer permanent suture pancreas capsule bowel serosa muscle , inner layer run dissolvable suture duct pancreatic parenchyma full thickness bowel wall . In duct-to-mucosa technique , out layer interrupt permanent suture . However , inner layer interrupt anastomosis pancreatic duct bowel mucosa . In one single institution study utilize duct-to-mucosa technique internal stent , Strasberg et al demonstrate pancreatic fistula rate 1.6 % 123 patient . In another review Tani et al , fistula rate 11 % stented duct-to-mucosa technique 6.5 % 2 layer end-to-side externally stented technique . There one small randomize , prospective trial evaluate duct-to-mucosa versus end-to-side PJ report literature . In trial , author randomize 144 patient undergoing PD either 2-layer duct-to-mucosa anastomosis single layer end-to-side anastomosis invaginate . Pancreatic fistula see 14 % patients—13 % duct-to-mucosa group 15 % end-to-side group difference complication group . It entirely clear study anastomosis perform , appear construction compatible method commonly use today . Therefore , propose perform randomize , prospective , control study compare two technique . This study offer patient Thomas Jefferson Hospital undergoing PD . Patients recruited basis preoperative anticipation pancreaticoduodenal resection preoperative consent obtain . Stratification randomization perform intraoperatively , follow pancreaticoduodenal resection . Because many study demonstrate leak rate directly relate pancreatic texture , stratify two group : soft ( normal ) texture ( predict fistula rate 15-30 % ) hard ( fibrotic ) texture ( predict fistula rate 0-15 % ) . Patients randomize one two group : 1 ) pancreatic duct jejunal mucosa , two-layer anastomosis 2 ) end-to-side , two-layer , invagination technique . The intraoperative management patient influence study direction attend surgeon . The perioperative care patient , include use prophylactic antibiotic , gastric acid secretory inhibition agent , nasogastric tube , time removal operatively place closed-suction drain , restoration oral intake remain direction attend surgeon . If postoperative pancreatic fistula occur , attend surgeon manage fistula appropriately . We Critical Pathway place use standardize patient care insure uniform postoperative management . Immediately follow PD , attend surgeon complete short questionnaire document type resection perform , type anastomosis , character remnant pancreas , size pancreatic duct , pancreas transect ( stapler , electrocautery , etc ) , detail operative procedure . Other routine data collect include detail operative procedure ( operative report ) , pathology resect specimen ( pathology report ) , occurrence postoperative morbidity mortality .</detailed_description>
