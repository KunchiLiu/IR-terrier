	<brief_summary>This study use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) compare brain function three group people : hearing-impaired people tinnitus ; hearing-impaired people without tinnitus ; people normal hear without tinnitus . Also know `` ring ear , '' tinnitus false sensation sound . Adults 30 65 year age meet follow criterion may eligible study : - Mild moderate hearing loss experience tinnitus daily least 1 year - Mild moderate hearing loss never rarely experienced tinnitus - Normal hearing never rarely experienced tinnitus Candidates screen medical history questionnaire . Participants detail hear test measure hear nature tinnitus . In second visit , subject brief physical examination , follow MRI scan . MRI use magnetic field radio wave produce image body tissue organ . For procedure , subject lie table slide scanner ( narrow cylinder ) , wear earplug muffle loud knock thump sound occur scan process . The subject may ask lie still 8 minute time . During MRI , subject performs computer-based task involve listen sound . Another hearing test do MRI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjective tinnitus , false perception sound absence acoustic stimulus , occur frequently consequence noise-induced deafness . The purpose study investigate brain site mechanisms underlie tinnitus use combined mathematical model functional brain imaging experimental approach . Although study focus neural base tinnitus , know tinnitus arise certain case hear loss , contribution different brain region tinnitus perception poorly understood . This turn , prevents development good study new treatment method tinnitus . The primary hypothesis network brain region , auditory process area emotional processing area , contributes , modulates , tinnitus perception . The brain imaging study use study difference network brain region involve listen discriminate sound tinnitus sufferer compare control group subject similar hearing loss without tinnitus . This comparison permit identification brain region active tinnitus . An age match control group without hear loss tinnitus include determine effect due hearing loss alone . The mathematical computational modeling use previously develop large-scale neural network model auditory process cerebral cortex , modify induce tinnitus via different neural mechanism . The modeling study allow u evaluate contribution different cortical region mechanisms tinnitus perception ; change model successful others induce tinnitus match simulate brain imaging data experimental brain imaging data . The modeling study use stimuli experimental paradigm functional brain imaging study . Comparing experimental modeling result provide hypotheses likely mechanism mediate tinnitus . Together , model experimental study advance knowledge brain region mechanisms underlie tinnitus .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Plus Tinnitus Plus Hearing loss subject . Adults , age 30 65 year . Are able hear perceive sound use experiment range 250 Hz 2 KHz highfrequency sensorineural hearing loss begin low 2 KHz . In good health currently take certain medication regularly ( e.g . antidepressant , antiseizure medication , antipsychotic , etc. ) . Experience tinnitus daily . Have nonpulsatile tinnitus least 1 year . Have bilateral bilateral unilateral dominance tinnitus . Minus Tinnitus Plus Hearing loss subject . Adults , age 30 65 year . Are able hear perceive sound use experiment range 250 Hz 2 KHz highfrequency sensorineural hearing loss begin low 2 KHz . In good health currently take certain medication regularly ( e.g . antidepressant , antiseizure medication , antipsychotic , etc. ) . Have never rarely ( i.e . transient episode experience virtually everyone ) experience tinnitus . Minus Tinnitus Minus Hearing loss subject normal volunteer . Adults , age 30 65 year . Have normal hearing . In good health currently take certain medication regularly ( e.g . antidepressant , antiseizure medication , antipsychotic , etc. ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects pacemaker , aneurysm clip , metallic prosthesis shrapnel fragment . Subjects incapable give informed consent . Subjects positive pregnancy test . Children age 18 year . Subjects hyperacusis misophonia ( hypersensitivity loud noise ) . Subjects mood disturbance depression anxiety . Subjects history temporomandibular joint problem present symptom pain tenderness temporomandibular joint examination . Subjects may exclude follow reason may cause difficulty interpretation image data : Subjects mental physical illness , tinnitus may cause problem participation study . Subjects current uncontrolled hypertension , significant past history cardiovascular disease diabetes melitus . Subjects history head trauma loss consciousness , epilepsy , seizure , history chemotherapy ( neurotoxic ototoxic ) medical condition may alter cerebral functioning . Subjects take history take recreational drug alcoholism . Subjects unilateral asymmetrical hearing loss ( provide documentation ) comprehensive neurootologic workup exclude .</criteria>
