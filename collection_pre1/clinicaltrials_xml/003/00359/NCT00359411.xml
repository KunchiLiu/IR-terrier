	<brief_summary>This study study effect gene X chromosome associate X-linked lymphoproliferative disease ( XLPD ) -an inherited disease affect immune system-on function immune system . XLPD link abnormality specific region X chromosome ( one 23 chromosome pair contain gene determine person 's hereditary makeup ) . The disease may develop infection Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) . EBV affect 95 percent people United States . It usually cause symptoms child . In adolescent adult , however , EBV cause infectious mononucleosis sometimes lymphoproliferative disease , XLPD . In disease lymph tissue , lymph node , may become enlarged immune function ( infection-fighting ability ) impair . This study compare DNA patient XLPD unaffected relative , patient lymphoproliferative disease normal control . Patients age XLPD , unaffected relatives 18 year age old , patient lymphoproliferative disease may participate study . Blood sample collect participant study effect gene X chromosome appear abnormal XLPD function immune system . In 6-week period , 100 milliliter ( 7 tablespoon ) blood drawn adult 1 ml ( 1/6 teaspoon ) blood per pound body weight child . Blood patient XLPD relative also test HLA type ( similar blood type test ) ability HLA-matched cell patient relative interact examine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Males X-linked ymphoproliferative disease ( XLPD ) mark susceptibility Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) disease . These boy develop severe disease associate infectious mononucleosis ; others develop hypogammaglobulinemia B cell lymphoma . Recent study link disease region X-chromosome . The purpose study determine function gene responsible XLPD . Blood sample discard tissue ( e.g . previous biopsy autopsy material ) patient XLPD relative analyze determine precise genetic defect associate disease . Blood sample discard tissue patient EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease blood sample normal individual obtain serve control . Knowledge gain study provide important insight immunologic control EBV lymphoproliferative disease associate congenital acquire immunodeficiency . In addition , identification molecular mechanism disease may provide clue EBV-associated disease include nasopharyngeal carcinoma , Burkitt lymphoma , Hodgkin 's disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients know XLPD relative recruit family enrol national XLPD registry . All racial ethnic group consider . To consider XLPD , patient must male : severe infectious mononucleosis , acquire hypogammaglobulinemia follow infectious mononucleosis , nonHodgkin 's lymphoma , hyperIgM IgG subclass deficiency evidence linkage DXS42 locus know immunocompromising condition belong family another relate male one list phenotype . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Known HIV infection patient XLPD relative ( blood test HIV ) , complicate medical psychiatric condition unrelated control .</criteria>
