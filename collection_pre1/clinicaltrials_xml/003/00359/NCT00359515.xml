	<brief_summary>This study investigate genetic basis oculocerebrorenal syndrome Lowe ( OCRL ) -a rare X-linked disorder ( carried female pass male ) . Patients OCRL abnormal development eye lens , developmental delay , muscle weakness kidney dysfunction . The study examine DNA cell sample obtain archive patient OCRL enrol previous protocol ( HG008A ) 1996 1999 . It identify mutation OCRL1 gene responsible OCRL affect male try correlate specific biochemical cellular activity ( e.g. , enzyme activity , protein stability , cellular localization trafficking ) . When test result available , information communicate patient , parent ( patient minor ) physicians , family receive genetic counseling .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Analysis Oculocerebrorenal Syndrome Lowe</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oculocerebrorenal syndrome Lowe ( OCRL ) rare X-linked disorder characterize congenital cataract , mental retardation , renal tubular dysfunction . Patients know suspected OCRL enrol previous protocol 96-HG-0008 expired 1998 renew . We continue study DNA cell sample obtain archive previous protocol identify mutation OCRL1 gene responsible Lowe syndrome relate disorder affect male attempt correlate mutation particular biochemical cellular phenotype ( enzyme activity , protein stability , cellular localization trafficking ) . Information genotype communicate back patient , parent ( patient minor ) physicians part study . We also continue investigation heterogeneity OCRL study collect cell culture collaborator Dr. Steven Scheinman Suny New York Medical University , Syracuse , group patient mutation OCRL1 Dent disease , characterize renal tubular dysfunction . These data , variability renal CNS abnormality occur OCRL evidence existence modifier . We propose identify gene differentially express cell OCRL patient , patient Dent disease OCRL1 mutation gene expression analysis RNA patient sample . As part study phenotypic genetic heterogeneity OCRL , mutation analysis result identification mutation mostly second two-thirds OCRL1 . However , OCRL1 mutation Dent disease patient find first third OCRL1 . We plan send sample Lowe syndrome patient without identified OCRL1 mutation Dr. Steven Scheinman look OCRL1 mutation . He send cod sample look OCRL1 mutation . He send coded sample access patient identifier . This information use research purpose .</detailed_description>
