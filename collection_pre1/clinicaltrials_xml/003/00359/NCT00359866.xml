	<brief_summary>Indications post-hysterectomy radiation therapy ( RT ) well establish clinical data . Adjuvant RT demonstrate local control survival benefit . In patient nodal disease , adjuvant chemotherapy concurrent radiation improve clinical outcome . The acute hematological gastrointestinal toxicity concurrent chemo-radiotherapy quite high , sometimes prevent patient complete full treatment course , potentially compromise therapeutic benefit treatment . Intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) advance method deliver external beam radiation may minimize volume normal tissue irradiate high dose thus decrease risk normal tissue toxicity . Helical tomotherapy novel treatment device sophisticate image treatment delivery feature optimally suit IMRT . There retrospective clinical data support use non-tomotherapy deliver IMRT treat patient gynecologic cancer . The propose study prospectively test whether helical tomotherapy feasible method deliver IMRT post-hysterectomy cervical cancer patient receive adjuvant RT . Here , question feasibility simply one verify target volume reliably cover 'sculpted ' IMRT high-dose region . Although treatment effectiveness study , also follow clinical outcome patient , include toxicity , local control survival , anticipation information valuable treatment modality judge feasible used treatment patient population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients cervical cancer receive post-operative radiotherapy ( RT ) high risk feature find pathologic review treat pelvic intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) . Helical tomotherapy use plan deliver radiation treatment . Treatment volume include upper third vagina para-vaginal tissue common , external internal iliac nodal region . External beam radiation deliver 180 cGy daily fraction total dose 5040 cGy . Patients receive day treatment five day week , approximately 6 week . Concurrent chemotherapy and/or intracavitary brachytherapy may include treatment plan discretion treat physician , consistent routine clinical practice .</detailed_description>
