	<brief_summary>The purpose study identify gene responsible several inherited disorder commonly see Amish Mennonite population learn natural history ( medical problem develop time ) disorder . In addition , researcher establish computer database contain Amish genealogy , derive largely community extensive record birth , marriage , death , etc. , help construct pedigree ( family tree ) genetic study . The Amish Mennonite people high rate intermarriage within individual community , result high incidence inherit disorder . Many disorder , cartilage-hair hypoplasia , Ellis-van Creveld syndrome , others , rarely see outside community . New research use state-of-the-art methodology genetics add current knowledge cause symptoms disorder eventually aid diagnosis medical management . Patients inherited disorder occur frequently Amish Mennonite population family member may eligible study . Individuals within outside community may enroll . Participants evaluate review medical record personal family medical history brief physical examination . A small tissue sample collect genetic study . This either blood sample ( 3 teaspoon adult 1 3 teaspoon child , depend size ) mouth swab ( cell remove inside cheek gentle brushing ) . Some participant may undergo additional procedure , diagnostic X-rays , brain scan , echocardiogram ( heart ultrasound ) study . If genetic testing show gene change ( mutation ) , participant notify effect writing offer counsel home regard test result implication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Amish Mennonite population represent outstanding community study genetic disease number reason . There high degree inbreeding , result high frequency recessive disorder , many see rarely unknown outside population . Extensive genealogical record available , average family size large . This proposal include number collaborator extremely close , extensive interaction Lancaster County Amish past decade ; relationship community invaluable success project . We substantial success research past seven year , lead discovery molecular etiology four human diseases establishment useful database tool genealogical analysis . We propose continue line research characterize disorder identify additional one , well enlarge computerize Anabaptist genealogy .</detailed_description>
