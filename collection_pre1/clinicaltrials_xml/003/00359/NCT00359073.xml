	<brief_summary>People asthma may asthma worsen upper respiratory infection due virus common cold . Leukotrienes increase nasal secretion child Respiratory Syncytial Virus ( RSV ) lung washing time acute lung inflammation . Experimental virus exposure adult also associate increase nasal leukotrienes . The degree leukotrienes play role asthma worsen unknown.There information link leukotrienes viral infection , allergic inflammation , asthma exacerbation.This information support hypothesis virus-induced leukotrienes contribute severity respiratory infection susceptible individual , lead low airway obstruction exacerbation asthma . We propose use montelukast experimental viral challenge model explore hypothesis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Viral infection important cause wheeze illness throughout childhood adult asthma . There progress identifying mechanism risk factor severe respiratory symptom , particular , wheeze . Given close relationship , would attractive apply antiviral strategy prevention treatment asthma , RV RSV obvious target . Unfortunately , attempt develop RSV vaccine far unsuccessful , vaccination prevent RV infection seem feasible due large number serotypes . Antiviral medication test clinical trials,53-57 however one problem approach clinical sign symptom appear , viral replication well underway . As result , reduction respiratory symptom duration illness modest.56 The potential therapeutic approach respiratory viral infection would selectively inhibit pro-inflammatory immune response induce virus . The beneficial effect systemic glucocorticoid indicate approach valid ; challenge develop treatment great efficacy reduce potential adverse effect . The large body information link cysteinyl leukotrienes viral infection , allergic inflammation , asthma exacerbation , strongly support hypothesis virus-induced leukotrienes contribute severity respiratory infection susceptible individual , lead low airway obstruction exacerbation asthma . We propose use montelukast experimental viral challenge model explore hypothesis .</detailed_description>
