	<detailed_description>Stroke lead cause disability Canada frequently cause hemiparesis ( upper limb lower limb weakness one side body ) . Approximately one third stroke survivor require physical rehabilitation improve motor functional recovery ( 1 ) . Although many strategy show effective promoting recovery stroke , uptake evidence-based practice rehabilitation professional across Canada variable . The aim project evaluate whether use implementation intervention promote use best practice rehabilitation professional lead improvement patient outcome individual stroke . This project cluster randomize implementation trial upper low limb intervention . Rehabilitation centre across Canada randomize receive either outcome-oriented implementation strategy ( OOI ) facilitate implementation EIPRs process-oriented implementation strategy ( POI ) . At onset , rehabilitation professional practice centre receive education use best practice outcome measure relate stroke rehabilitation . All centre assess baseline adherence EIPRs . Centres OOI receive `` usual care '' ( i.e . passive dissemination write protocols information outcome measure ) . Centres POI arm receive combination strategy facilitate EIPR uptake ( i.e. , use local facilitator , practice audit feedback , reminder system educational session ) . Following exposure EIPRs , centre document adherence EIPRs , patient outcome assess measure . An analysis cost associate rehabilitation intervention incremental expense POI strategy undertaken . These data use compare OOI POI centre respect level uptake implementation EIPRs related expense .</detailed_description>
