	<brief_summary>The aim clinical research project evaluate use recombinant human activate factor VII ( rhFVIIa ) , give salvage therapy , woman dramatic postpartum hemorrhage still ongoing currently available medical surgical treatment . We go compare early use , elective surgery arterial embolization , late use , embolization surgery , salvage hysterectomy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Depending country publication , postpartum hemorrhage either first second cause maternal death world , include developed country . According WHO , responsible twenty two percent maternal death . In France , postpartum hemorrhage account five percent delivery complication . Three percent severe , lead uncontrolled bleeding intensity high 1000 ml blood 24 hour follow delivery . In France , involve 20 new death per year ; first cause maternal mortality . Indeed , remain significant source morbidity : severe anaemia , blood transfusion , transfusion complication , acquire coagulation disorder hemostatic hysterectomy . There two different type postpartum hemorrhage : early late hemorrhage . Early hemorrhage common occur first 24H delivery . Uterine atony main cause early hemorrhage . However , visual assessment underestimate amount blood loss around forty five percent case . Emergency treatment therefore sometimes undertaken delay , give time disseminate intravascular coagulation ( DIC ) occur , worsens prognosis . They usually treat medical resuscitation , blood transfusion , selective arterial embolisation finally hysterectomy case ongoing uncontrolled bleeding . Medical treatment obstetric manoeuvre usually effective . Artificial delivery placenta perform immediately placenta incomplete . Afterwards , oxytocin prostaglandin derivative give . At time , anemia hemostatic abnormality treat transfusion fresh frozen plasma pack cell . When measure insufficient , surgery necessary . Bilateral ligation hypogastric artery control embolisation recommend . In case uncontrolled bleeding , hemostatic hysterectomy perform salvage therapy . Also , efficacy ligation hypogastric artery remain controversial . Therefore , success rate ligation hypogastric artery forty two percent , many case hysterectomy require , induces definitive sterility . The development interventional radiology offer new approach management postpartum hemorrhage . Many publication show usefulness procedure , whose success rate around ninety percent . However , specific technical plateau need , far available place moment . For patient deliver far away technical site , limit blood loss crucial . Among method aim limit obstetrical hemorrhage , special concern give recombinant activate factor VII , drug use good therapeutic result symptomatic patient hemophilia inhibitor . It already apply intervention situation . Taking consideration describe aspect , goal thus evaluate potential medical interest give rhFVIIa early course hemorrhage , compare give salvage therapy arterial selective embolization hysterectomy patient still bleed , order avoid hemostatic hysterectomy . In literature , IV infusion rFVIIa stop ongoing diffuse hemorrhage , rapidly , transfusion require rFVIIa injection . Then rFVIIa , might strong complementary agent management major postpartum hemorrhage . Optimal dose , time safety characteristic rFVIIa administration remain determine . Therefore , main objective study : 1. evaluate reduction absolute risk arterial embolization/surgery/hysterectomy patient receive unique early infusion rhuFVIIa ( 60 Âµg/kg body weight ) ; 2. evaluate number woman necessary treat avoid one arterial embolization/surgery/hysterectomy .</detailed_description>
