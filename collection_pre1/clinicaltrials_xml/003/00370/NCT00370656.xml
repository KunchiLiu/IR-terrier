Amitriptyline believe relieve pain improve sleep , though little evidence beneficial effect sleep . Furthermore , even low dos , affect reaction time , attention , memory , information processing . In two study duloxetine , show significantly reduce pain compare placebo , although little data available usefulness compound management pain poor sleep . Pregabalin show effective reduce pain , therefore improve sleep . It also demonstrate limited potential affect daytime cognition . In another study gabapentin ( compound structurally related pregabalin ) demonstrate superior efficacy management pain compare amitriptyline . Therefore study ass effectiveness pregabalin , duloxetine amitriptyline compare placebo reduce pain associate diabetes poor sleep . As incidence diabetes predict increase future year consequence case diabetic peripheral neuropathy ( DPN ) , research serve provide essential information sleep DPN beneficial future .</detailed_description>
