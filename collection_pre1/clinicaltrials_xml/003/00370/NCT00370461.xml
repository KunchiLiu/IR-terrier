	<brief_summary>In Ontario , people experience cardiac arrest home ( heart stop beat ) receive basic life support Primary Care Paramedics ( PCPs ) transport hospital . Most pronounced dead emergency physician mean survival rate patient 5 % . Allowing Primary Care Paramedics use termination resuscitation guideline would identify futile case resuscitation unwarranted decrease number patient transport emergency department ( ED ) pronouncement . There numerous advantage strategy ; first , may improve efficiency ED cardiac arrest patient require immediate attention divert patient well chance survival . Second , risk injury monetary cost paramedic public would minimize few `` light siren '' transport know hazardous motorist , pedestrian , Emergency Medical Services ( EMS ) personnel . For cardiac arrest , PCPs respond call usual implement standard basic life support cardiac arrest protocol . Patients categorize accord termination resuscitation recommendation : 1. return spontaneous circulation achieve ( heartbeat ) ; 2. shock give prior transport ; 3. arrest ( heart stop beat ) witness EMS personnel . If criterion true , PCP contact hospital decision emergency physician make stop life save measure ( terminate resuscitation ) home continue life support transport patient local emergency department . This study aim document usefulness termination resuscitation guideline decrease rate transport out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patient ED . Secondary aim implementation study describe rate erroneous application guideline . The comfort use rule among paramedic base hospital emergency physician describe .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Basic Life Support Termination Resuscitation Implementation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Ontario , victim out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA ) receive Advanced Cardiac Life Support ( ACLS ) ; rather , receive Basic Life Support ( BLS ) Primary Care Paramedics ( PCPs ) , survival rate approximately 5 % . Every one patient transported Emergency Department ( ED ) , vast majority pronounce dead . Conversely , patient respond ACLS Advanced Care Paramedics ( ACPs ) pronounce dead field via patch Base Hospital Physician ( BHP ) . Implementation termination resuscitation ( TOR ) guideline PCP 's use would decrease number non-viable patient transport ED . A reduction unsuccessfully resuscitate cardiac arrest patient transport ED would numerous advantage . First , may improve efficiency ED health care system cardiac arrest patient ED require immediate attention divert potentially salvageable patient . Second , risk injury monetary cost paramedic public would minimize few `` light siren '' transport know hazardous motorist , pedestrian , EMS personnel . Additionally , less expensive pronounce non-viable patient field . And , finally termination resuscitative effort field permit paramedic turn attention skill set support family initial stage grief . The recent American Heart Association ( AHA ) emergency cardiac care guideline suggest need develop TOR protocol PCPs situation ACLS care rapidly available , call scientific evidence support implementation guideline . We derive prospectively validated clinical prediction rule guide PCP termination resuscitation hospital cardiac arrest . The TOR implementation study aim document usefulness TOR guideline , specify newly develop medical directive , decrease rate transport OHCA patient ED . Secondary aim implementation study describe rate erroneous application guideline . The comfort use rule among paramedic base hospital emergency physician describe . This multi-centre prospective implementation study involve combination urban rural regional EMS system across Ontario . Included consecutive patient suffer non-traumatic cardiac arrest ( i.e . presumed cardiac etiology ) . Identical derivation validation phase , patient exclude study : arrest due trauma , drown drug overdose ; receive prehospital ACLS care ; posse document `` Do Not Resuscitate '' directive ; le 18 year age . Cases meet inclusion criterion enrol consecutively . For cardiac arrest , paramedic respond call usual initiate resuscitation attempt . Patients suffer cardiac arrest ( 1 ) witness EMS personnel ; ( 2 ) shock deliver anyone ; ( 3 ) return spontaneous carotid femoral pulse meet criterion TOR . In circumstance PCPs patch local BHP use standard patching process . The BHP direct paramedic either continue resuscitation transport , terminate resuscitation field base TOR guideline clinical judgment individual call . In case failure paramedic reach BHP , paramedic direct continue resuscitation transport per normal procedure , regardless TOR guideline recommend . Data case request paramedic emergency physician use uniform data collection sheet standardize Ontario Ambulance Call Report ( ACR ) . The rate patient transport ED calculate . The obtained rate transport compare theoretical rate obtain validation study , 37.4 % use one sample test , two side , test proportion , order evaluate utility rule decrease transport rate . Rates erroneous application rule paramedic emergency physician calculate identify tabulate various reason non-compliance . Occurrence adverse patient outcome , ROSC TOR closely monitor .</detailed_description>
