	<detailed_description>Objective There study develop country assess safety midlevel provider ( MLP ) compare physician perform first-trimester manual vacuum aspiration abortion . In South Africa Viet Nam , MLP ( midwife physician assistant ) train accredited perform first trim abortion increase woman ’ access safe abortion service . Complication rate first-trimester manual vacuum aspiration compare type provider two country . Methods : A randomized , two-sided control equivalence trial conduct compare rate abortion complication . An priori margin equivalence 4.5 % 80 % power 95 % CI (  = 0.025 ) use . Women present induced abortion 12 week ’ gestation randomly assign physician midlevel provider manual vacuum aspiration followed-up 10 14 day later . Complications record abortion procedure , discharge clinic follow-up . The study include 25 provider 2894 case , 1160 South Africa 1734 Viet Nam . Results : Complication rate 1.4 per 100 MLP 0 physician South Africa . In Viet Nam , complication rate 1.2 per 100 MLP 1.1 per 100 physician . In country , complication rate satisfy pre-determined statistical criterion equivalence . In South Africa , difference complication rate mid-level provider physicians 1.4 per 100 ( CI=0.4 2.7 ) . In Viet Nam , difference complication rate mid-level provider physicians 0.1 per 100 ( CI= -1.0 1.2 ) . There major immediate complication . Delayed complication retain product infection . Conclusions : First trimester manual vacuum aspiration abortion perform trained accredited midlevel provider South Africa Viet Nam comparable safety perform physician . Given appropriate training , midlevel health care provider provide first trim manual vacuum aspiration abortion safely physician abortion provider .</detailed_description>
