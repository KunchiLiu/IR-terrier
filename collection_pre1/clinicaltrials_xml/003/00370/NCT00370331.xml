	<brief_summary>The rationale Phase III study evaluate 6 month safety efficacy eltrombopag treatment previously treat subject chronic ITP . The start dose eltrombopag , 50 mg , daily select base upon observed efficacy , safety pharmacokinetics dose-finding Study ( TRA100773 ) . This Phase III study randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , Phase III study , evaluate efficacy , safety tolerability eltrombopag , initially administer 50 mg oral tablet daily six month adult subject previously treat chronic ITP . Subjects randomize 2:1 , eltrombopag placebo , stratify base upon splenectomy status , use ITP medication baseline baseline platelet count less equal 15,000/µL . Subjects receive study medication 6 month , dose study medication may adjust base upon individual platelet count . In addition , subject may taper concomitant ITP medication may receive rescue treatment dictate local standard care . After discontinuation study medication , subject complete follow-up visit week 1 , 2 , 4 month 3 6 .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : A subject eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : Subject sign dated write informed consent . Adults ( ≥18 year ) diagnose chronic ITP accord American Society Hematology/British Committee Standards Hematology ( ASH/BCSH ) guideline [ George , 1996 ; BCSH , 2003 ] , platelet count &lt; 30,000/μL Day 1 ( within 24 hour prior dose Day 1 ) . In addition , peripheral blood smear support diagnosis ITP evidence cause thrombocytopenia ( e.g . pseudothrombocytopenia , myelofibrosis ) . The physical examination suggest disease may cause thrombocytopenia ITP . Subjects previously receive one prior ITP therapy . Previous treatment ITP include limited corticosteroid , immunoglobulin , azathioprine , danazol , cyclophosphamide and/or rituximab . Subjects must either initially respond ( platelet count &gt; 100,000/μL ) previous ITP therapy bone marrow examination consistent ITP within 3 year rule myelodysplastic syndrome cause thrombocytopenia . Previous therapy ITP immunoglobulin ( IVIg antiD ) must complete least 1 week prior randomization platelet count must show clear downward trend last treatment immunoglobulin . Previous treatment ITP splenectomy , rituximab cyclophosphamide must complete least 4 week prior randomization , clearly ineffective . Subjects treat concomitant ITP medication ( e.g . corticosteroid azathioprine ) must receive dose stable least 4 week prior randomization . Subjects treat cyclosporine A , mycophenolate mofetil danazol must receive dose stable least 3 month prior randomization . The medication continue stable dose initial 6 week study `` Concomitant ITP Therapy '' ) Prothrombin time ( PT/INR ) activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) must within 80 120 % normal range history hypercoagulable state . A complete blood count ( CBC ) , within reference range ( include WBC differential indicative disorder ITP ) , follow exception : &lt; 30,000 platelets/μL Day 1 ( within 24 hour Day 1 ) require inclusion , Hemoglobin : Subjects hemoglobin level 10 g/dL ( 100 g/L ) low limit normal eligible inclusion , anemia clearly attributable ITP ( excessive blood loss ) . ANC ≥ 1500/μL ( 1.5 x 10^9/L ) require inclusion ( elevated WBC/ANC due steroid treatment acceptable ) . The following clinical chemistry MUST NOT exceed upper limit normal ( ULN ) reference range 20 % : creatinine , ALT , AST , total bilirubin , alkaline phosphatase . In addition , total albumin must lower limit normal ( LLN ) 10 % . Subject practice acceptable method contraception ( documented chart ) . Female subject ( female partner male subject ) must either nonchildbearing potential ( hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy , bilateral tubal ligation postmenopausal &gt; 1 year ) , childbearing potential use one follow highly effective method contraception ( i.e. , Pearl Index &lt; 1.0 % ) two week prior administration study medication , throughout study , 28 day completion premature discontinuation study : Complete abstinence intercourse ; Intrauterine device ( IUD ) ; Two form barrier contraception ( diaphragm plus spermicide , male condom plus spermicide ) ; Male partner sterile prior entry study partner female ; Systemic contraceptive ( combine progesterone ) . Subject able understand comply protocol requirement instruction intend complete study plan . Exclusion criterion : A subject NOT eligible inclusion study follow criterion apply : Any clinically relevant abnormality , ITP , identify screen examination medical condition circumstance , opinion investigator make subject unsuitable participation study suggest another primary diagnosis ( e.g. , thrombocytopenia secondary another disease ) . Concurrent malignant disease and/or history cancer treatment cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy . Any prior history arterial venous thrombosis ( stroke , transient ischemic attack , myocardial infarction , deep vein thrombosis pulmonary embolism ) , AND ≥ two follow risk factor : hormone replacement therapy , systemic contraception ( contain estrogen ) , smoke , diabetes , hypercholesterolemia , medication hypertension , cancer , hereditary thrombophilic disorder ( e.g. , Factor V Leiden , ATIII deficiency , etc ) , family history arterial venous thrombosis . Preexisting cardiovascular disease ( congestive heart failure , New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] Grade III/IV ) , arrhythmia know increase risk thromboembolic event ( e.g . atrial fibrillation ) , subject QTc &gt; 450 msec . Female subject nurse pregnant ( positive serum urine bhuman chorionic gonadotrophin pregnancy test ) screen predose Day 1 . History alcohol/drug abuse . Treatment investigational drug within 30 day five halflives ( whichever longer ) precede first dose study medication . Subject treat drug affect platelet function ( include limit aspirin , clopidogrel and/or NSAIDs ) anticoagulants &gt; 3 consecutive day within 2 week study start end study . History platelet agglutination abnormality prevents reliable measurement platelet count . All subject secondary immune thrombocytopenia , include laboratory clinical evidence HIV infection , antiphospholipid antibody syndrome , chronic hepatitis B infection , hepatitis C virus infection , evidence active hepatitis time subject screening . If potential subject clinical history would support HIV infection hepatitis infection , laboratory screen necessary ; however , standard medical practice would suggest evaluation patient risk factor infection . Previous participation clinical study eltrombopag . Patients plan cataract surgery . In France , subject neither affiliated beneficiary social security category .</criteria>
