	<detailed_description>Endometriosis affect 15-20 % woman reproductive life . Endometriosis chronic disable inflammatory disease , characterize implantation growth endometrial tissue ( glandular epithelium stroma ) outside uterine cavity . Retrograde menstruation find 80 % -90 % woman . In woman endometrial cell undergo apoptosis . In patient suffer endometriosis cell induce inflammatory response . Pelvic endometriosis associate intrinsic anomaly refluxed endometrium , increased secretion pro-inflammatory cytokine , neoangiogenesis , impaired function cell-mediated natural immunity . Endometriosis also consider autoimmune disease , owe presence auto antibody , association autoimmune diseases recurrent immune-mediated abortion . Evidence suggest Foxp3-expressing CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cell play crucial role suppression inflammatory disease . However , role suppression endometriosis yet address . We aim study aberrant regulation endometrial cell apoptosis investigate peripheral blood immune system patient suffer endometriosis . Hypothesis : We hypothesize immune peripheral mononuclear cell patient suffer pelvic endometriosis react differently eutopic endometrial cell match control woman group . This difference could study molecular , antigenic and/or apoptotic cycle gene expression . We also hypothesize deficiency regulatory T cell associate progression endometriosis . Study design : This open label prospective vitro study two year . Patients : 50 Patients suffer endometriosis undergo laparoscopy compare 50 patient undergoing laparoscopy reason . Methods : 1 . Blood withdrawal pipelle endometrial cell harvest 2 . Isolation peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) 3 . Generation T cell line ( patient ) 4 . Measurement cytokines 5 . Determination T- cell subset flow cytometry 5 . PMNC T cell line freeze liquid nitrogen store at-70C future study . 6 . Endometrial tissue serve ad antigenic source generate T cell line remnant store at-70C future study .</detailed_description>
