	<brief_summary>This study GW274150 , iNOS ( inducible nitric oxide synthase ) inhibitor investigate safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics ( PK ) rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) population ( great 50 year ) . Safety , tolerability PK GW274150 adult elderly population yet determine . Therefore study design ensure 90mg GW274150 safe well-tolerated adult elderly RA patient population methotrexate . The assessment include pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , liver function test creatinine clearance . This study provide confidence single 90mg dose GW274150 result exposure RA subject similar expect healthy volunteer asthmatic .</brief_summary>
