	<brief_title>Spinal Cord Stimulation Chronic Intractable Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Management symptom chronic back pain and/or lumbar radiculopathy often difficult inadequate . Current treatment option include pharmacological treatment , physical therapy , nerve block , surgical interruption pain pathway , back surgery . Many patient either adequate pain management conventional treatment able tolerate treatment due significant side effect . Similarly , many patient either candidate surgical intervention , unwilling undergo procedure . Spinal cord stimulation proven effective treatment patient pain follow fail back surgery , study investigate spinal cord stimulation treatment option treatment chronic back pain patient never back surgery . A successful study outcome establish spinal cord stimulation less-invasive treatment option consider prior surgery .</detailed_description>
