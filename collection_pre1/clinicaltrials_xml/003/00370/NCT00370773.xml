	<brief_title>Comparison Intraspinal Nerve Root Stimulation With Dorsal Column Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study investigate efficacy subthreshold intraspinal nerve root stimulation ( INRS ) treat back pain . The efficacy strategy test dorsal column stimulation ( DCS ) , commonly-accepted technique spinal cord stimulation . DCS test subthreshold suprathreshold ( perceptible ) amplitude . A substudy involve patient prefer suprathreshold DCS INRS subthreshold DCS . Its purpose systematically assess pain relief afford number program different pulse width . The overall purpose study investigate method make pain relief via electrical stimulation comfortable either use subthreshold amplitude adjust pulse width perceptible stimulation please range .</detailed_description>
