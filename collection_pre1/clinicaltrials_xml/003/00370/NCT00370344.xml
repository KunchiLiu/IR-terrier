Previous trial compare minilaparotomy laparoscopic cholecystectomy hamper surgeonsÂ´ different expertise two method . These study indicate operation time short health care cost low minilaparotomy compare laparoscopic cholecystectomy , hard data scarce . The objective present trial randomize eligible patient two group surgeon , well train either minilaparotomy cholecystectomy laparoscopic cholecystectomy . Surgeons minilaparotomy group consider extension incision necessary , surgeon laparoscopic group aim laparoscopic cholecystectomy conversion open cholecystectomy indicate . The design study allow wide inclusion criterion participant , cost-utility approach analysis , high external validity conclusion reach . Comparison : Minilaparotomy cholecystectomy compare laparoscopic cholecystectomy gallbladder disease .</detailed_description>
