	<detailed_description>The quest effective pharmacotherapy problem gambling remain important priority problem gamble treatment research field . While several medication evaluate controlled clinical trial medication show unequivocally reduce gamble behaviour , date , medication approve treat disorder . Recently , topiramate , indicate treatment seizure disorder , show promise pharmacotherapy problem gambling . The persuasive evidence efficacy topiramate report alcohol ( placebo-controlled study ) problem gambling ( fluvoxamine serve active control ) . No study examine efficacy topiramate placebo-controlled clinical trial examine efficacy within specific sub-groups gambler . Topiramate recently find effective number psychiatric addictive disorder . Dannon report first trial evaluate topiramate treatment pathological gambling , compare fluvoxamine . Treatment deliver 12-week period maximum dose 200 mg/d . Nine 15 topiramate subject achieve full remission gamble behaviour compare 6 16 fluvoxamine subject . However , group improve similar degree measure psychopathology ( e.g. , anxiety ) . This study Dannon 's previous study topiramate 's efficacy treatment kleptomania , suggest topiramate may particularly effective Impulse-Control Disorders . Topiramate-induced modulation noradrenergic pathway mediate hyper- arousal , conditionability intrusive/ emotional memory suggest medication may particularly efficacious problem gambler characterize hyper-arousal , anxiety depression . Blaszczynski delineation Pathways Model problem pathological gambling , identify group problem gambler self-regulate dysphoric emotional state escape , dissociation numbing ( i.e. , Emotionally Vulnerable problem gambler ) . The Impulsivist Conditioned problem gambler , two sub-types described Blaszczynski characterize condition history may less effectively target topiramate ( i.e. , impulsive , antisocial personality structure case Impulsive gambler irrational cognition case Conditioned problem gambler ) . This population gambler , especially common among female , may report positive history substance abuse , anxiety mood disorder , familial childhood dysfunction , familial gambling . In open-label study topiramate sample patient post-traumatic stress disorder , amelioration dissociation numbing report . These finding also consistent medication 's report amnesic effect , suggest topiramate may reduce neural reactivity problem gambler would otherwise increase probability engage gamble self-regulate dysphoric emotional state . The current study proposes evaluate clinical efficacy topiramate randomize , placebo-controlled clinical trial , first study . Interaction effect medication gamble sub-type examine determine whether efficacy topiramate correlate specific biopsychosocial history gambler . An experimental trial acute dose topiramate run concurrently order identify cognitive-behavioural mechanism may mediate clinical effect topiramate gambling-related behaviour evaluate study .</detailed_description>
