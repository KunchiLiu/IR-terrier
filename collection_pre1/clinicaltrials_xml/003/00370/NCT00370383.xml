	<brief_summary>Patients ≥ 70 year age locally advance unresectable metastatic non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) frequently receive systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy due concern regard inability tolerate treatment . Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKIs ) agent favorable toxicity profile show activity patient NSCLC . Erlotinib single-agent currently approve treatment patient NSCLC whose disease progress follow one prior course chemotherapy currently evaluate NSCLC patient receive prior systemic treatment . However , study combination chemotherapy first-line setting , continuous daily administration erlotinib result improve patient survival . Further clinical vitro data suggest sequence cytotoxic chemotherapy EGFR TKIs important maximize therapeutic potential administer combination . Satraplatin oral , investigational anticancer drug member platinum-based class chemotherapy drug . Platinum-based drug clinically prove one effective class anticancer therapy . Unlike currently market platinum-based drug , satraplatin give orally currently evaluate pivotal phase 3 clinical trial 2nd-line therapy patient hormone refractory prostate cancer . The rationale study develop active well-tolerated oral regimen patient ≥ 70 year age NSCLC . Administration study drug sequence satraplatin administered day 1-5 erlotinib day 8-21 28-day cycle .

	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Sequential Satraplatin &amp; Erlotinib Erlotinib Unresectable Stage 3/4 Non-small-cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Erlotinib single-agent currently approve treatment patient NSCLC whose disease progress follow one prior course chemotherapy currently evaluate NSCLC patient receive prior systemic treatment . However , study combination chemotherapy first-line setting , continuous daily administration erlotinib result improve patient survival . Further clinical vitro data suggest sequence cytotoxic chemotherapy EGFR TKIs important maximize therapeutic potential administer combination . Satraplatin orally administer platinum analogue show promising single-agent activity multiple tumor type include prostate , ovarian , small cell lung cancer . Additionally , single-agent activity satraplatin NSCLC similar commonly use platinum agent use treat NSCLC . However , satraplatin well tolerate cisplatin , cause less renal toxicity ototoxicity , administer outpatient set . From toxicity profile , similar carboplatin myelosuppression dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) . Satraplatin currently evaluate pivotal phase 3 clinical trial 2nd-line therapy patient hormone refractory prostate cancer . The rationale study develop active well-tolerated oral regimen patient ≥ 70 year age NSCLC may candidate aggressive combination systemic chemotherapy . Administration study drug sequence satraplatin administered day 1-5 erlotinib day 8-21 28-day cycle . As erlotinib show advantage survival without commensurate improvement response rate , primary endpoint progression-free survival ( PFS ) ; thus patient randomize treatment either experimental regimen single-agent continuous erlotinib .</detailed_description>

Age ≥ 70 year old . ECOG performance status 01 Prior treatment systemic therapy allow provide follow criterion meet : No EGFR target therapy ( TKI antibody ) No prior platinum agent . Neoadjuvant , adjuvant , part combine modality regimen ( i.e. , metastatic disease ) Completion &gt; 6 month prior enrollment onto study . Patients previous radiation therapy ( RT ) definitive therapy locally NSCLC eligible follow criterion meet : Site tumor recurrence outside original RT port unless incontrovertible evidence disease progression within portal All side effect RT must resolve prior enrollment . Completion RT ≥ 4 week prior enrollment . Previous radiation must treat &lt; 30 % active bone marrow . Patients undergone thoracotomy must fully recover surgery start treatment least three week operative procedure .
