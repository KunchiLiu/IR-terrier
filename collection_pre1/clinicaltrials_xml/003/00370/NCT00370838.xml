	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , 15 week ( two treatment phase ) , 1 week run-in , cross-over study , patient receive 6 week treatment levetiracetam 6 week treatment course clonidine , separate two week medication wash-out . The investigator plan enroll twenty patient age 7 19 year moderate moderately-severe Tourette syndrome chronic motor/vocal tic . The recruitment period expect approximately 12 month ( total study length 18 month ) . The study begin screen evaluation ensure subject satisfies eligibility criterion , allow subject become familiar assessment procedure , obtain informed consent . Following baseline visit , one week `` run-in '' treatment period order screen high placebo responder , subject receive placebo . If patient 's tic severity score fail improve he/she begin double blind treatment period ( levetiracetam/clonidine ) , last six week follow two week wash period , second double blind treatment period ( clonidine/levetiracetam ) additional six week . A statistician involve care subject responsible randomization . A six week trial treatment choose allow adequate drug response period . Patients follow phone weekly interval throughout study formally evaluate begin end treatment phase . At completion study , patients/parents give opportunity continue successful treatment . The primary outcome measure Yale Global Tic Severity Scale ( YGTSS ) : A semi-structured clinical interview design measure current tic severity . Other outcome measure include Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale ( CGI-I ) , Child Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale ( CYBOCS ) , DuPaul Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) Rating Scale , Child Depression Inventory ( CDI ) , Multi-Dimensional Anxiety Scale Children ( MASC ) , expand Pittsburgh Side-Effect Scale . Subjects recruit Tourette Syndrome Clinic Johns Hopkins Hospital . This clinic , direct Dr. Harvey Singer , currently follow 1000 chronic tic patient average 4 new referral every week . The clinic staff longstanding successful record design complete therapeutic protocol treatment tic . Inclusion Criteria : see Exclusion Criteria : see Procedures : ) Screening visit : Determination diagnostic eligibility criterion ( medical history complete physical examination ; evaluation tic severity , screen female begin menstruate urine pregnancy test , familiarization assessment procedure , obtain informed consent . The urine pregnancy test obtain female 12 year age . Parents tell result test . If patient uncomfortable tell result pregnancy test parent ( ) , may decide take part study . ii ) Baseline Visit ( Day 0 ) : Evaluation prior run-in ( placebo ) phase include weight , heart rate , blood pressure , respiratory rate , rating scale : tic , Yale Global Tic Severity Scale ( YGTSS ) Childhood Global Impression-TS ( CGI-TS ) ; adverse effect , Pittsburgh Side-Effect Rating Scale ; obsessive-compulsive problem , Child Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale ( CY-BOCS ; attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , DuPaul ADHD Rating Scale , depression , Child Depression Inventory- Short Version ( CDI-S ) ; anxiety , Multidimensional Anxiety Scale Children ( MASC ; episodic outburst , Rage Attack Rating Scale . iii ) Run-in Placebo Phase ( day 0-7 ) : Immediately baseline visit , subject start placebo treatment one week period . All subject receive 1 capsule twice day ; capsule similar appearance use drug treatment phase . The Run-in phase add eliminate subject whose treatment outcome could influence transient exacerbation tic exposure non-pharmacologic treatment . ) Post- Run Period Evaluation ( day 8 ) : Subjects return re-evaluation symptom , emphasis place rating scale : tic , Yale Global Tic Severity Scale ( YGTSS ) Childhood Global Impression-TS ( CGI-TS ) ; adverse effect , Pittsburgh Side-Effect Rating Scale . If tic improvement follow receipt placebo , patient move treatment phase study . In contrast , tic symptom reduce 15 % significant side effect report , treatment discontinue subject withdrawn study . iv ) Treatment phase ( day 8 50 day 65 107 ) : A computer generate unequal randomized scheme use assign patient either levetiracetam clonidine initial treatment phase . Research Pharmacy Johns Hopkins responsible packaging levetiracetam ( supplied UCB ) clonidine ( purchase ) , randomize allocation , distribute medication . Levetiracetam clonidine repackaged look-alike capsule different dosage level : levetiracetam , 250 milligram ( mg ) 500 mg clonidine , 0.05 mg 0.1 mg . Patients receive six week supply medication first treatment phase visit ( day 8 ) begin second treatment phase ( day 63 ) . A study physician ( Dr. Harvey Singer ) responsible change medication dosage monitor side-effects . A Safety Monitoring Board establish oversee medication use monitor side-effects . 1 . Levetiracetam : The start dose levetiracetam 10 mg/kg/day one week ; administer 5 mg/kg twice day ( B.I.D . ) ( round closest unit 250 mg ) . If need tic suppression , dose increased weekly 5-10 mg/killigrams ( kg ) /day . The maximum dose 50 mg/kg/day ( administer 25 mg/kg BID ) , maximum dose 2,500 milligram per day . For reference , dose 10 60 mg/kg/day levetiracetam currently use pediatric study treatment seizure 2000 mg TS child mean age 12 year . In individual subject , dose escalation may proceed slowly , dose may reduce necessary . No change dosage make final week treatment phase . 2 . Clonidine : The start dose clonidine 0.05mg BID one week . If need tic suppression , dose increased weekly 0.05-0.1 mg . The maximum dose 0.4 mg ( administer 0.2 mg BID ) . iv ) Wash phase : Between two treatment phase , medication taper ten day period . Levetiracetam taper end treatment phase 5-10 mg/kg/day every third day . The half life levetiracetam approximately 7-8 hour healthy volunteer , 5 8 hour epileptic patient , 10 hour elderly . Clonidine taper 0.05 - 0.1 mg every third day . Subjects medication 5 day start second phase cross study . v ) End study drug taper : At completion second treatment phase , medication taper ten-day period , reduce medication equal proportion every third day . vi ) Early stop rule : Subjects may withdraw study time discretion subject , attend physician , investigator . 1 . The investigator decide subject withdrawn . This decision could make adverse effect failure comply study protocol . 2 . The subject his/her personal physician request subject withdrawn study . 3 . The subject , reason , require treatment another therapeutic agent could conflict use levetiracetam clonidine . 4 . A Drug Safety Monitoring Board monitor side effect assist determine whether subject withdrawn trial . Members board full time Johns Hopkins Hospital faculty member epilepsy fellow experience use levetiracetam . The Board access randomization code maintain statistician . A quarterly update meeting schedule Monitoring Board topic review include number subject , dosage schedule , side effect , therapeutic response . Significant adverse event report sponsor Union chimique belge , Inc ( UCB , Inc ) , Johns Hopkins Joint Committee Clinical Investigation ( JCCI ) , Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) within 24 hour . vii ) Evaluations : This 15 week study . Telephone evaluation perform blind Research Assistant day 14 , 21 , 28 , 35 , 42 , 70 , 77 , 84 , 91 , 98 . At telephone session clinical response , possible side effect , drug compliance , medication adjustment discuss . Subjects formally evaluate 4 separate time include baseline ( day 0 ) , end run-in phase ( day 8 ) , end first treatment phase ( day 49 ) , end drug wash period ( day 63 ) , end study ( day 105 ) . Evaluations visit Research Assistant include vital sign , weight , assessment side effect use Pittsburgh side effect scale . The blinded outcome evaluator , Dr. Harvey Singer , administer score YGTSS , CGI I , DuPaul ADHD scale , CY BOCS , CDI S , MASC . In addition , visit pill count do assure compliance . C. Outcomes Measures : ) Yale Global Tic Severity Scale ( YGTSS ) : The YGTSS semi-structured clinical interview design measure current tic severity [ Leckman et al. , 1989 ] . This scale consist separate rating severity motor ( total motor , 0 25 ) vocal ( total vocal , 0 25 ) tic . Ratings make along 5 discriminant dimension , scale 0 5 include number , frequency , intensity , complexity , interference . Summation score ( i.e. , 0 50 ) provide Total Tic Score ( TTS ) primary outcome measure . The YGTSS also contain separate ranking impairment ( Tic Impairment Score TIS ) , maximum 50 point , base impact tic disorder area self esteem , family life , social acceptance , school score . Because focus study evaluate impact levetiracetam clonidine tic TIS may incorporate component TS , Total Tic Score ( TTS ) select primary outcome measure . ii ) Clinical Global Impression-Improvement ( CGI-I ) : The CGI-I use compare current severity baseline . A score 1 correspond `` much improve ; @ 2 equal `` much improve ; '' 3 denotes minimal change ; 4 represent `` change . '' Scores 4 used indicate deterioration , i.e. , 5 equal `` minimally bad ; '' 6 `` much worse ; '' 7 `` much worse . '' iii ) Child Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale : The severity OCD evaluate use Child Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale ( CY-BOCS ) [ Scahill et al , 1997 ] . Obsessions compulsion rat 5 separate scale yield three summary score : Obsessions ( 0-20 ) , Compulsions ( 0-20 ) Total score ( 0-40 ) . The CY-BOCS widely use instrument assess severity obsessive-compulsive symptom research study involve child . It include checklist specific obsession compulsion follow examiner rating time spend , interference , distress , resistance control obsession compulsion assess independently . The CY-BOCS well establish psychometric property . iv ) DuPaul ADHD Rating Scale : The presence ADHD symptom assess use DSM-IV version ADHD rating scale develop DuPaul . This scale incorporate symptom item ADHD DSM rating scale format quantifies symptom severity . Each item rat , little , pretty much , much ( 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 ) . This scale normed large clinical community sample excellent psychometric property include test-retest reliability 2-week period 0.93 significant correlation direct observation classroom behavior . v ) Child Depression Inventory-Short Version ( CDI-S ) : Depression severity rat use Child Depression Inventory-Short Version ( CDI-S . This 10 item scale take 5 minute complete . It excellent psychometric property design repeated administration time . vi ) Multidimensional Anxiety Scale Children ( MASC ) : The child 's anxiety follow use multidimensional Anxiety Scale Children ( MASC ) consider preferred instrument rating childhood anxiety . vii ) Adverse effect : Side effect assess expanded Pittsburgh Side Effect Scale modify include side effect levetiracetam clonidine . Significant adverse event report UCB , JCCI , FDA within 24 hour . D. Open Label Continuation : At completion study subject give option continue either levetiracetam clonidine open label fashion . This enable subject see another physician access study code . This physician continue follow subject entire study complete . For member research team , treatment code broken subject complete protocol . IV . Analytical Strategies A . Inclusion Run-in phase : The Run-in phase add eliminate subject whose treatment outcome could influence transient exacerbation tic exposure non-pharmacologic treatment . B . Power calculation : As described , pilot randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , cross-over project investigator plan enroll twenty patient age 7-19 year Tourette Syndrome . Subjects moderate severe TS enrol treatment protocol . Data randomize , double-blind , placebo-controller trial tic suggest 6.0 point YGTSS total tic score reasonable estimate standard deviation outcome variable population interest . The investigator estimate approximately 19 subject provide desire power 0.9 detect difference 4.2 point mean 6-week change YGTSS total tic score two treatment arm , use two-tailed t-test 5 % level significance . C. Statistical evaluation : The primary outcome measure effective tic suppression determine difference Total Tic score treatment arm levetiracetam clonidine . Secondary outcome measure include Tic Impairment Score , Total YGTSS score , CGI-I . Data compare change absolute test score percentage baseline . Unpaired Student 's t-tests use compare treatment placebo group across clinical variable baseline . A paired t-test 95 % confidence interval use compare change outcome measure baseline endpoint two treatment group ( levetiracetam clonidine ) regardless treatment order . Using secondary assessment ( Analysis Variance ( ANOVA ) level within respective class contain subject complete study , 2 treatment , 2 period ) , investigator analyze outcome measure two-period ( day 8 49 63 105 ) , two-treatment , two-sequence design test effect treatment , first second period , treatment period interaction . To evaluate effect levetiracetam clonidine blood pressure , pulse , weight , DuPaul ADHD scale , CYBOCS , CDI-S , MASC , investigator conduct series repeat measure ANOVA examine difference group across time . Statistical significance analysis set alpha=0.05 two-tailed test . This protocol format use effectively prior study baclofen levetiracetam .</detailed_description>
