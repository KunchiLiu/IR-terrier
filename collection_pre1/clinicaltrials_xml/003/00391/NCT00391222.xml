	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety Risperidone Prevention Mood Episodes Treatment Patients With Bipolar I Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , double-dummy multicenter study 3 parallel arm ( risperidone long-acting injectable ( LAI ) , placebo , olanzapine ) evaluate efficacy safety risperidone LAI versus placebo prevention mood episode ( recurrence event ) . The primary objective study evaluate efficacy risperidone LAI monotherapy versus placebo prevention mood episode ( recurrence event ) patient bipolar I disorder 12-week ( 3 month ) stabilization period risperidone LAI , measure time recurrence mood episode . This study include 3 period - screening period ( Period I , last 2 week ) ; open-label treatment period ( Period II , last 12 week ) ; double-blind treatment period ( Period III , last 18 month least 9 month ) . In open -label treatment period ( Period II ) treatment risperidone LAI start injection recommend dose 25 mg every 14 day patient enter Period II . If judge clinically appropriate , patient may start 37.5 mg every 14 day . Dosage increase ( maximum dose 50 mg every 14 day ) Clinical Global Impression - Severity ( CGI-S ) score increase = &gt; 1 2 consecutive assessment least 2 week apart symptom exacerbation treat adequately short-term ( 14 day ) benzodiazepine medication . If increase risperidone LAI dosage necessary , oral risperidone ( 1 2 mg/day ) need added 3 week first injection high dosage . Washout psychotropics risperidone long acting must complete end first week . Non-acute patient antipsychotic mood stabilizer least 4 week continue previous treatment first 3 week . No change make regimen non-acute patient receive antipsychotic mood stabilizer unless concern efficacy safety.Patients experience acute manic mixed episode additionally treat oral risperidone whole-milligram dosage 1 6 mg/day need treat symptom acute episode first 3 week , order cover 3 week lag period Risperidone long act . Patients experience acute episode respond treatment within 4 week discontinue study . Patients show response ( acute patient baseline ) maintain efficacy ( non-acute patient baseline acute patient initial response ) 12-week ( 3 month ) open-label risperidone LAI stabilization period ( Period II ) , discontinue study soon one follow criterion meet : The patient meet Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders , 4th Edition , text revise ( DSM-IV-TR ) criterion hypomanic , manic , mixed , depressive episode ; patient need treatment intervention mood stabilizer , antipsychotic medication ( study drug ) , benzodiazepine ( beyond dosage allow ) , antidepressant medication ; patient require hospitalization bipolar mood episode ; patient either Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) score &gt; 12 combination CGI-S score = &gt; 4 Montgomery-Ã…sberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) score &gt; 12 combination CGI-S score = &gt; 4 . ( If either criterion fulfil assessment investigator assume temporary state require action , investigator allow postpone decision maintenance response maximum 4 day . If 4 day , criterion still meet , patient must withdraw Period II . ) Patients show initial maintain response ( acute patient baseline ) maintain efficacy ( non-acute patient baseline ) 12-week ( 3-month ) open-label risperidone LAI stabilization period ( Period II ) , eligible enter double-blind treatment period ( Period III ) . Patients enter Period III randomize receive intramuscular injection risperidone LAI every 14 day ( dosage achieve end Period II ) oral placebo daily , placebo injection every 14 day oral placebo daily , placebo injection every 14 day oral olanzapine 10 mg/day . No supplementation oral risperidone dosage titration allow period study . Using double-dummy design , patient receive intramuscular injection every 14 day take oral medication every day . Patients present recurrence Period III , consider meeting end point study . Patients remain double-blind treatment period meet recurrence criterion , withdraw consent , lose follow-up , last patient complete least 9 month without mood episode Period III , study end . The study end 158 patient present mood episode Period III , study terminate base decision sponsor . Approximately 860 patient meet inclusion exclusion criterion enrol study , goal observe least 158 recurrence event Period III . Safety evaluation include adverse event , clinical laboratory test - include blood glucose/lipid profile ( fast ) , prolactin , TSH , urinalysis - vital sign ( pulse blood pressure ) ECG , physical examination , body weight height , Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale , pregnancy testing , urine drug screen . The patient receive risperidone LAI ( 25 , 37.5 50 mg ( period II ) ) every 14 day 12 week long open-label period ( Period II ) . Patients enter double-blind period ( Period III ) randomize receive intramuscular injection risperidone LAI every 14 day oral placebo daily , placebo injection every 14 day oral placebo daily , placebo injection every 14 day oral olanzapine 10 mg/day .</detailed_description>
