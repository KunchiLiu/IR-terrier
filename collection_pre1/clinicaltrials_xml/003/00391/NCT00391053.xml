	<brief_summary>Compared young adult , elderly mount lower antibody response vaccination . Thus , improvement immune response influenza vaccination age group , high risk influenza-related morbidity mortality , represent important unmet need . Primary Objectives : Immunogenicity : - To demonstrate lot consistency Fluzone High Dose ( Fluzone HD ) manufacturing process evaluation immune response elicit three different lot . - To demonstrate superiority Fluzone HD vaccine compare standard-dose Fluzone® vaccine . Secondary Objectives : Immunogenicity : - To describe seroprotection Fluzone HD compare standard dose Fluzone® vaccine . Safety : - To describe safety profile Fluzone HD , term solicit - , unsolicited adverse serious adverse event post-vaccination . - To describe clinical information additional define criterion six month follow vaccination .</brief_summary>
