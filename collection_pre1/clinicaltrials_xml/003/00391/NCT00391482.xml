	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine efficacy peer-volunteer intervention reduce high-risk transmission behavior among hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) -infected young adult injection drug user ( IDUs ) , identify proportion individual would eligible willing undergo treatment eradicate HCV infection . HCV one frequently occur human viral infection , estimate worldwide prevalence 3 % . In many region United States , 65 % 95 % IDUs HCV-seropositive capable transmit infection . To date , research study target infected individual prevent secondary transmission chronic blood-borne viral infection generally limit post-test counseling case management . In addition , recent data suggest medical treatment HCV infection may effective offer soon HCV seroconversion . However , proportion HCV-infected IDUs meet strict national guideline HCV treatment likely small treatment usually postpone drug use continue . Determining proportion infect individual may eligible willing undergo HCV therapy highly important guide national standard objective achieve great number IDUs HCV therapy . We previously report few 1 % HCV-infected IDUs Baltimore currently receive therapy . Early initiation HCV treatment among young IDUs conjunction reduction HCV transmission risk behavior may ultimately lead reduction incident HCV infection individual community level . This study randomize control trial determine efficacy `` peer-volunteer activism '' intervention reduce distributive syringe injection paraphernalia share behavior among HCV positive IDUs promote uptake HCV care treatment . If proven effective , intervention would substantially decrease risk HCV infection community . To address aim , plan recruit , screen , randomly assign 750 IDUs age 18-35 year HCV-seropositive HIV-seronegative Baltimore , New York Seattle behavioral intervention ( 250 per site ) , prospectively monitor participant behavior 3- 6-month follow-up visit .</detailed_description>
