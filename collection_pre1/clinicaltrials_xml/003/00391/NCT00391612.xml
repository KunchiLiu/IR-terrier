	<brief_summary>This international clinical research study evaluate safety effectiveness new procedure call airway bypass . The goal research see airway bypass relieve hyperinflation ( overfill ) lung , thereby improve lung function reduce shortness breath patient severe homogeneous ( diffuse ) emphysema . `` EASE '' stand Exhale Airway Stents Emphysema .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EASE Trial : Exhale Airway Stents Emphysema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 3 million people United States tens million throughout world live emphysema , chronic , progressive , irreversible disease lung . The hallmark emphysema hyperinflation lung -- air trap lung escape , cause lung become large large . This make difficult breathe dyspnea ( shortness breath ) result . The airway bypass procedure perform use bronchoscope patient anesthesia . Very small passageway create damage lung tissue large breathing passage ( airway ) . Small stent insert keep new pathway closing . These pathway could potentially provide way trapped air escape patient exhales . If amount air trap lung reduce easy person breathe . The EASE study compare effect Exhale Drug-Eluting Stents patient sham-control group patient receive stent . Two three ( 2/3 ) participant trial airway bypass group , `` treatment '' group . Participants treatment group undergo airway bypass procedure six drug-eluting stent implanted lung , create passageway trap air escape . A small group - one three ( 1/3 ) participant - `` control '' group . The control group bronchoscopy , passage make stent implant . Participants need return study center four time year follow-up visit test . All participant tell group come back follow-up visit one year procedure . Participants control group finish trial one year . Participants treatment group follow-up visit year next four year monitor long term effect airway bypass procedure . This end date trial listed 2012 .</detailed_description>
