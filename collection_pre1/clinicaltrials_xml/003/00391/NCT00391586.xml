	<brief_summary>This study conduct compare activity erlotinib intravenous , platinum-based therapy treatment non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . The goal trial demonstrate clinical equivalence erlotinib platinum-based frontline therapy , compare historical control .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Standard Platinum-Based Chemotherapy Newly Diagnosed , Advanced Non-Small Cell Carcinoma Lung</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To compare activity ( progression-free survival , incidence severity toxicity , reversibility toxicity ) erlotinib platinum-based therapy NSCLC . A sequential therapy design choose patient receive potential benefit platinum-based erlotinib therapy , without compromise survival deny anyone potential therapy . With design , progression-free survival track treatment receive . However , data generate show safety efficacy erlotinib frontline setting ( alone historical comparison platinum-based therapy ) , well potential safety activity platinum-based therapy `` second-line '' ( post-erlotinib ) setting . This allow demonstration relative median time progression , objective response clinical benefit rate , overall survival , safety tolerability erlotinib platinum-based therapy frontline second-line setting NSCLC . Also , fashion , treatment serve control , well compare historical control ; first line treatment portion , platinum-based regimen serve historical control , second-line setting , erlotinib serve historical control arm .</detailed_description>
