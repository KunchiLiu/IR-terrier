	<brief_title>Treatment Outcomes Ankle Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Project Objective : Ankle osteoarthritis characterize joint pain , tenderness , limitation movement , variable degree inflammation . These factor combine left untreated severely limit person 's mobility willingness participate activity . Two common surgical procedure choose alleviate pain increase mobility ankle arthrodesis ( ankle fusion ) arthroplasty ( ankle replacement ) . Success rate procedure variable amount information available regard long-term follow-up limit . The extent person able willing move around world often indicator his/her condition . The propose study examine walk activity level , difference activity , patient immediately undergo surgical treatment ankle arthritis . Successfully regain motility priority patient elect surgical treatment ankle arthritis . A difference activity level would indicate important outcome difference surgical procedure . Research Plan : The investigator propose mobility outcome study 500 ankle osteoarthritis subject undergo corrective surgery . Methodology : The investigator propose mobility outcome study total 500 ankle osteoarthritis subject surgery three year study . Ankle arthritis subject recruit patient VA Puget Sound Health Care System ( Seattle , WA ) , Harborview Medical Center ( Seattle , WA ) , Orthopedic + Fracture Specialists ( Portland , OR ) , Orthopaedic Associates Michigan ( Grand Rapids , MN ) , Twin Cities Orthopedics ( Edina , MN ) diagnose end stage ankle arthrosis , ambulatory , speak English , cognitively intact , age 18-80 . Recruitment , inform consent procedure experimental protocol approve Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) study site . Since clinical equipoise would unethical randomize treatment time . This project observational study outcome follow two common treatment : Ankle arthrodesis ( fusion ) ankle arthroplasty ( total ankle joint replacement ) . The outcome assess two domain : Functional domain : Each subject 's functional status determine Musculoskeletal Function Assessment ( MFA ) SF-36 general health survey . The MFA write questionnaire ass activity social limitation cause musculoskeletal injury . After complete questionnaire , subject fit Stepwatch Activity Monitor ( SAM , Cyma , Seattle WA ) around ankle . An investigator give verbal instruction wear SAM . This small , pager-sized device count number step take wearer . The SAM wear around subject 's ankle 14 day , subject return monitor activity log VA visit mail . Assessments use MFA SF-36 occur prior surgical intervention 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 36 month follow intervention . Assessments use SAM occur prior surgical intervention 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 36 month follow intervention . These assessment provide data functional limitation due ankle arthritis efficacy treatment restore functional ambulation . Biomechanical domain : Instrumented gait analysis perform subject . Reflective marker place subject 's head , hand , arm , trunk , leg , foot . The subject walk along 12 walkway embed forceplates . The motion marker collect 10 camera Vicon 612 system process determine motion ankle joint three plane well moment power generate ankle walking . This allow u assess technical functional ankle joint , range motion use gait moment , power energy contribution ankle walk treatment . Gait assessment occur prior surgical intervention 12 , 24 , 36 month post-op . Gait assessment take place VA Puget Sound Health Care System Seattle , WA . The investigator recruit subject VA Harborview Medical Center gait analysis portion study .</detailed_description>
