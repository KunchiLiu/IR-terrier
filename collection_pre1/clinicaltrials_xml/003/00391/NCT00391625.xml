	<brief_summary>Gaucher disease rare lysosomal storage disorder cause deficiency enzyme glucocerebrosidase ( GCB ) . Due deficiency functional GCB , glucocerebroside accumulates within macrophage lead cellular engorgement , organomegaly , organ system dysfunction . The purpose study evaluate long term safety enzyme replacement therapy DRX008A ( VPRIV® , GA-GCB ; velaglucerase alfa ) patient type 1 Gaucher disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open-Label Extension Study Evaluating Long Term Safety Patients With Type 1 Gaucher Disease Receiving DRX008A ( ERT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 1 Gaucher disease , common form , account 90 % case involve central nervous system ( CNS ) . Typical manifestation type 1 Gaucher disease include hepatomegaly , splenomegaly , thrombocytopenia , bleed tendency , anemia , hypermetabolism , skeletal pathology , growth retardation , pulmonary disease , decrease quality life . Gene-Activated® human glucocerebrosidase ( long term safety enzyme replacement therapy DRX008A ( GA-GCB ; velaglucerase alfa ) produce continuous human cell line use proprietary gene-activation technology identical amino acid sequence naturally occur human enzyme . GA-GCB ( velaglucerase alfa ) contain terminal mannose residue target enzyme macrophages-the primary target cell Gaucher disease . This study design evaluate long term safety GA-GCB ( velaglucerase alfa ) patient Type 1 Gaucher disease</detailed_description>
