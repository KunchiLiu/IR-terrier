	<brief_title>VELCADEXA : Velcade Dexamethasone Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple Myeloma plasma cell disorder characterize uncontrolled proliferation bone marrow plasma cell lead skeletal destruction bone pain , anemia , renal failure , hypercalcemia , recurrent bacterial infection extramedullary plasmacytoma . It account 1 % malignancy slightly 10 % hematologic malignancy , annual incidence four per 100.000 . Although disease incurable median survival 3 year , remarkable treatment advance recently make , include high-dose therapy follow stem cell rescue , particularly , introduction novel promise agent new mechanisms action . Data pre-clinical clinical study conduct date support continue development VELCADE treatment Multiple Myeloma . Standard chemotherapy remain gold standard induction HDT/SCT treatment young multiple myeloma patient ( &lt; 65 year ) . Since VELCADE mechanism action different chemotherapy dexamethasone consider efficacious Multiple Myeloma , introduction induction regimen may contribute increase response rate eventually survival patient represent half myeloma population . Since VBMCP/VBAD consider gold standard Multiple Myeloma patient &lt; 65 year induction regimen prior HDT/SCT , result VEL/DEX compare obtain 100 patient treat VBMCP/VBAD chemotherapy last GEM protocol ( Spanish Myeloma Group ) patient &lt; 65 year ( close Dec 2004</detailed_description>
