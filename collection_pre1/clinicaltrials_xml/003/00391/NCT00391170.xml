	<brief_summary>This study determine dexamethasone mouth rinse reduce risk develop oral chronic graft-versus-host disease ( cGVHD ) patient undergone bone marrow ( stem cell ) transplant procedure . cGVHD common complication stem cell transplantation , result donor cell attack transplant recipient 's tissue . In oral cGVHD , tissue mouth damage , cause painful mouth sore . Dexamethasone corticosteroid commonly use treat inflammation . It corticosteroid available use mouth rinse . Patients 12 year age old receive stem cell transplant may eligible participate enrol within 70 90 day transplant . Candidates screen medical history oral exam . Participants randomly assign receive either dexamethasone rinse placebo ( solution look taste like dexamethasone rinse active medication ) . They undergo follow procedure : Treatment study solution . Patients rinse mouth dexamethasone solution placebo three time day 3 month . Clinic visit start treatment 1 , 2 3 month start study drug follow procedure : - Oral exam ( start treatment visit ) . - Photographs mouth ( start treatment 3 month ) . - Biopsy inside cheek ( start treatment ) . The inside cheek numb small piece tissue remove examination pathologist . - Saliva sample collection ( start treatment ) . - Blood draw ( start treatment visit ) . - Quality-of-life questionnaire ( start treatment 3 month ) . - Questionnaire assess level dry mouth mouth pain ( start treatment visit ) . - Review medication ( visit ) . - ACTH stimulation test evaluate adrenal gland function ( 3 month ) . Patients give injection drug call `` ACTH '' `` cosynthropin , '' version hormone normally produce pituitary gland . Blood sample draw injection 30 60 minute injection measure level hormone cortisol . After treatment end , participant contact telephone every month 6 month report symptom cGVHD , return clinic 6 month final evaluation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dexamethasone Prevent Oral Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prevention oral chronic graft verusu host disease ( GVHD ) topical agent attractive strategy would potentially avoid adverse effect associate systemic immunosuppression . Topically administer dexamethasone solution commonly use agent prophylaxis oral inflammatory condition include GVHD . However , efficacy systemic effect topically administer dexamethasone solution unknown . We therefore propose trial design evaluate efficacy safety topical dexamethasone solution prevention oral chronic oral GVHD stem cell transplant recipient . This pilot phase II study follow randomize , double-blind , placebo control , parallel group design . Consenting subject undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplantation NIH Clinical Center randomize 50/50 receive dexamethasone 0.01 % solution placebo oral rinse 3 month start 90-100 day post-transplant . Subjects evaluate monthly start intervention . Diagnostic research evaluation include complete oral examination , oral mucosal biopsy prior begin intervention ( day -7 ) time development oral chronic GVHD completion intervention absence clinical GVHD . We measure serum dexamethasone level perform short cosyntropin ( ACTH stimulation ) test end 3-months intervention onset clinically significant GVHD . The primary objective study evaluate safety efficacy topical dexamethasone 0.01 % solution use oral rinse prevention oral chronic GVHD . Our primary endpoint proportion subject develop clinically significant ( severity score 3 high ) oral chronic GVHD three month . Secondary objective include impact oral chronic GVHD quality life , characterization change tissue salivary biomarkers associate development oral graft versus host disease , measure effect topical dexamethasone hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis . Secondary outcome include oral cavity specific quality life measure OHIP-14 questionnaire , oral discomfort level , improvement general quality life score , severity oral chronic GVHD measure site-specific GVHD scoring system .</detailed_description>
