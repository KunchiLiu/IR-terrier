	<brief_title>Assessment Quadriceps Muscle Electrostimulation Used Patients Suffering From Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cystic fibrosis autosomal recessive genetic disease due mutation CFTR protein gene . The CFTR protein transport chloride ion ( Cl- ) across cell membrane lung , pancreas , digestive tract , reproductive tract , skin . CFTR mutation mainly lead dysfunction pulmonary system pancreas exocrine function . Several study show cystic fibrosis commonly induce reduction effort tolerance , peripheral muscular strength work capacity . Patients suffer cystic fibrosis high endurance capacity low risk poor prognosis . Those severe dyspnea high benefit force training combine force endurance training endurance train alone . We propose study effect quadriceps electrostimulation program , perform prior endurance retrain program use cycloergometer , patient cystic fibrosis associate severe pulmonary dysfunction , enhance muscular performance increase adherence cycloergometer retrain program . This randomized trial two group : Group A : experimental group , twenty patient . Six week electrostimulation program follow six week cycloergometer program . Group B : control group , twenty patient . Six week usual physical activity follow six week cycloergometer program . The Randomization stratify expiratory volume per second . The size randomization block random open design .</detailed_description>
