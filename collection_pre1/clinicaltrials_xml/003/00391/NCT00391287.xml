	<brief_summary>The purpose study estimate incidence rate pure red cell aplasia ( PRCA ; aplastic anemia ) mediate erythropoietin ( EPO ) antibodies patient receive subcutaneous ( s.c. ) epoetin alfa ( polysorbate 80 formulation ) treatment anemia associate chronic renal failure ( CRF ) , compare incidence rate incidence rate s.c. exposure currently market recombinant erythropoietin product ( epoetin alfa , epoetin beta , darbepoetin alfa ) , adjustment duration drug give patient . The study also examine impact pattern use mixed s.c. exposure multiple erythropoietin product occur patient , impact time treatment start onset PRCA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In 1998 , prompt concern human serum albumin ( HAS- stabilizer epoetin alfa formulation ) could theoretically transmit Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease bovine spongiform encephalopathy , alternative epoetin alfa formulation use polysorbate 80 stabilizer introduce . The polysorbate 80 epoetin alfa formulation become available variety product presentation ( i.e. , single-use vial prefilled syrinx coat uncoated stopper ) provide prescribe flexibility , patient convenience , choice route administration . Soon introduction polysorbate 80 epoetin alfa formulation prefilled syrinx , increase number case EPO antibody-mediated pure red cell aplasia ( PRCA ) report patient chronic renal failure ( CRF ) expose epoetin alfa s.c. route . This led contraindication s.c. route epoetin alfa European Union ( E.U . ) Switzerland December 2002 . It subsequently show increase risk PRCA associate one specific polysorbate 80 epoetin alfa presentation - prefilled syrinx uncoated rubber stopper . It appear uncoated rubber stopper , expose polysorbate 80 , release organic compound ( leachates ) epoetin alfa formulation , leachates probable product-specific cause increase EPO antibody-mediated PRCA . A worldwide recall polysorbate 80 epoetin formulation prefilled syrinx uncoated stopper complete March 2004 . FluroTec-coated stopper use prefilled syrinx contain polysorbate 80 epoetin alfa formulation , prevent leachates enter formulation . Following action , incidence rate EPO antibody-mediated PRCA CRF patient receive s.c. epoetin alfa fell level similar HSA-containing epoetin formulation , long-standing well-characterized safety profile . As 30 November 2005 , s.c. exposure CRF patient polysorbate 80 epoetin alfa formulation prefilled syrinx coat stopper 71,880 patient-years , 4 case EPO antibody-mediated PRCA report . In 2006 , E.U . Health Authorities reauthorized s.c. epoetin alfa use CRF patient intravenous access readily available . As part reauthorization , sponsor agree conduct registry order demonstrate polysorbate 80 epoetin alfa formulation use coat stopper acceptable immunogenic safety profile define incidence EPO antibody-mediated PRCA associate recombinant erythropoietin use among patient anemia associate CRF . This multicenter , multinational , immunogenicity surveillance registry use prospective cohort design ( patient identify common characteristic ) , enrollment parallel group expose polysorbate 80 formulation epeotin alfa market erythropoietin product administer s.c. route administration treatment anemia associate CRF . The registry design address follow question : Is current rate PRCA s.c. polysorbate 80 epoetin alfa formulation use coat stopper similar current rate market erythropoietin product administer s.c. route , adjust duration exposure ? Each patient observe development PRCA 3 year . Information exposure erythropoietin product , stage CRF , treatment modality CRF , erythropoietin handle storage information , recent hemoglobin level collect quarterly . Cases unexplained loss lack effect ( LOE ) administer erythropoietin product , include case suspect PRCA , report sponsor serious adverse event . Cases EPO antibody-mediated PRCA determine clinical presence suspect PRCA , unexplained LOE administer erythropoietin product , presence EPO antibody . An Independent Case Adjudication Committee review blind case data patient unexplained LOE identify case EPO antibody-mediated PRCA . A separate Independent Safety Advisory Committee responsible periodically review unblinded patient data summary data make recommendation relate incidence rate PRCA associate s.c. epoetin alfa use . The sponsor actively monitor registry enrollment erythropoietin brand usage ensure registry accrue 20,000 person-years s.c. exposure epoetin alfa 20,000 person-years s.c. exposure erythropoietin product combine . If appear one registry arm meet accrual goal , sponsor may elect selectively close investigational site predominant use erythropoietin product ( ) arm approach full accrual . The registry provide inducement change therapy non-interventional .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients establish CRF indication treatment anemia Patients receive receive ( within 1 month ) market erythropoietin ( i.e. , epoetin alfa [ EPREX/ERYPO/GLOBUREN ] , epoetin beta [ NEORECORMON® ] , darbepoetin alfa [ ARANESP® ] ) s.c. route administration Patients likely continue receive s.c. erythropoietin product ( ) least 1 year . Patients history pure red cell aplasia aplastic anemia Patients experience unexplained loss lack effect recombinant erythropoietin product ongoing time enrollment Patients prior recombinant erythropoietin treatment whose anemia never respond ( primary lack efficacy ) Patients history EPO antibodies prior enrollment Subjects currently receive immunosuppressive medication ( e.g. , cyclosporine , tacrolimus , sirolimus , mycophenolic mofetil , azathioprine , monoclonal antibody ) corticosteroid dose correspond &gt; 15 mg/day prednisolone Subjects whose first s.c. exposure erythropoietin product &gt; 1 year prior enrollment .</criteria>
