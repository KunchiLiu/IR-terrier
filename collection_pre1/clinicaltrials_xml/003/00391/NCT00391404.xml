	<detailed_description>The modern treatment childhood malignancy include surgery chemoradiotherapy either individually combination . Despite great achievement improve patient survival , treatment also greatly enhance adverse effect unfortunate child . Our research group recently conduct pioneer study bone mineralization bone mineral density ( BMD ) study longterm childhood cancer survivor local patient complete anti-cancer treatment least five year . This landmark study show persistent treatment-related adverse effect skeletal development common ( 50 % ) local long-term survivor childhood cancer . Thus , important critical period rapid somatic growth adolescent young adult cancer survivor achieve peak potential bone mineralization strengthen . In proposed study , investigate randomize controlled study design efficacy second-generation oral bisphosphonate , alendronate , improve BMD 36-week period long-term survivor childhood cancer Hong Kong . In addition alendronate , subject active control group receive alfacalcidol ( vitamin D ) calcium carbonate throughout whole study period . The study result help paediatric oncologist decide optimal remedial treatment osteoporosis long-term cancer survivor .</detailed_description>
