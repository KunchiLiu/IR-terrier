	<brief_title>EXTENT : EXtended Tolerability Efficacy Novel Formulation Oxcarbazepine Trial Partial Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multi-centre , randomize , open-label , flexible-titration , control , parallel-group study investigate safety efficacy novel modify release formulation oxcarbazepine ( OXC MR ) compare immediate release oxcarbazepine ( OXC IR ) product patient partial epilepsy . Adult patient gender , age least 18 year refractory partial epilepsy , without secondary generalisation receive stable background treatment daily dosages exactly 900 1200 1500 mg Oxcarbazepine enrol . Concomitant medication consist maximal 2 additional AEDs ( vagus nerve stimulator include ) allow must keep stable throughout study . Patients , agree participate , first sign date inform consent undergo evaluation screen visit determine eligibility . Those patient qualify enrol study , assign patient ID , enter 4-week baseline period . Each patient receive seizure diary record number seizure baseline period . For Visit 1 patient return clinic complete baseline procedure . Patients meet entry criterion randomise . The two treatment group consist 50 patient , one group treat OXC MR b.i.d . treat OXC IR b.i.d . 1:1 randomization . Following assignment one treatment group patient enter dose-titration phase . From Visit 1 ( Study Day 1 ) total daily dose 1200 mg /1500 mg /1800 mg oxcarbazepine give randomise patient . From Day 6 dosage titrate maximum total daily dose 2700 mg step 300 mg every 6th day . Patients experience intolerable adverse event could reduce daily dose 150 mg 2nd day up-titration remainder treatment period . In case reduce dosage also tolerate , second step dosage reduce 150 mg OXC . The maximal tolerate dose achieve up-titration maintain final visit ( Study Day 26 ) .</detailed_description>
