	<brief_title>Phase II Study Perifosine Patients With Refractory Relapsed Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase II study perifosine patient refractory relapse leukemia . After one time load dose 600 mg ( 150 mg x 4 least 4 hour apart ) first cycle , perifosine give orally 100 mg day continuously . Cycles 28 day length . Intra-patient dose escalation maintenance dose 150 mg daily do second cycle non-hematological toxicity beyond grade 0-1 occur first cycle observe . Patients assess efficacy end 28 day cycle therapy , +/- 7 day . Complete remission , partial remission hematological improvement kind count towards objective response disease . A maximum total 37 evaluable patient enter two diagnostic group , distinguish due different anticipate rate accrual . Group 1 : AML , MDS , CML-BP non-lymphoid , CMML , Agnogenic Myeloid Metaplasia ( AMM ) ; Group 2 : CLL , ALL , CML-BP lymphoid . A maximum total 74 patient enrol study .</detailed_description>
