	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate effectiveness , safety , tolerability influenza vaccine . Influenza highly infectious disease occur throughout world winter month . Infection influenza virus major public health threat ability spread rapidly affect large number people . Up 1359 healthy adult age 18 less 65 year old participate study 24 day . Volunteers receive injection either influenza vaccine thimerosal , vaccine without thimerosal , placebo thimerosal . Volunteers ask document information health change 21 day follow vaccination . Volunteers return clinic day 5 21 vaccination share information study staff . On day 21 , volunteer physical examination . Blood sample take prior vaccination Day 21 post-vaccination .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose Phase III , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , multi-center study evaluate immunogenicity , safety , tolerability CSL Limited Inactivated Influenza Vaccine adult age 18 less 65 . The primary objective study demonstrate vaccination CSL Limited Inactivated Influenza Vaccine produce immune response sufficient meet Committee Medicinal Products Human Use ( CHMP ) criterion young adult 40 % serorconversion 70 % seroprotection . Secondary objective : demonstrate clinical consistency 3 lot ( batch ) CSL Limited Inactivated Influenza Vaccine multi-dose vial presentation ( Thimerosal contain ) ; demonstrate clinical consistency CSL Limited Inactivated Influenza Vaccine multi-dose vial presentation ( Thimerosal contain ) CSL Limited Inactivated Influenza Vaccine pre-filled syringe presentation ( Thimerosal-free ) ; demonstrate acceptable safety tolerability CSL Limited Inactivated Influenza Vaccine multi-dose vial presentation ( Thimerosal contain ) pre-filled syringe presentation ( Thimerosal-free ) . Primary endpoint seroprotection rate seroconversion rate . Seroprotection define minimum post-vaccination humagglutination inhibition ( HI ) titer 1:40 , seroconversion define increase HI antibody titer least 4-fold , minimum post-vaccination HI titer 1:40 . Secondary endpoint : comparison Geometric Mean Titers influenza hemagglutinin antigen post vaccination active treatment arm ; number rate type , frequency intensity adverse event ( AE ) active treatment arm . Approximately 1250 ( 1359 ) healthy adult , age 18 less 65 year old , enrol clinical trial . Subjects meet inclusion criterion study randomize 1:1:1:1:1 ratio receive 1 3 lot vaccine multidose vial , single lot vaccine pre-filled syrinx placebo multi-dose vial ( 250 subject per group ) . Vaccine prepare administer unblinded vaccine administrator , involved subsequent assessment . Subjects observe clinic least 30 minute vaccination , subject maintain 5-day , post-vaccination solicit AE local reaction memory aid 21-day unsolicited AE memory aid . Subjects return clinic day 5 review reactogenicity memory aid . Subjects also return clinic Day-21 post-vaccination AE concomitant medication assessment , target physical examination ( indicate ) , review memory aid . Serum antibody titer draw prior vaccination Day-21 post-vaccination . Subjects participate 24 day .</detailed_description>
