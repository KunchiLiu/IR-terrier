	<brief_title>Double-blind , Randomised , Placebo-controlled Trial Investigating BIRT 2584 XX Patients With Moderate/Severe Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study phase 2a/b international multicentre clinical trial . The general aim study investigate safety efficacy ( clinical proof concept ) three different dos ( 100 mg , 300 mg , 500 mg ) BIRT 2584 XX tablet administer orally daily compare placebo tablet treatment patient moderate severe plaque-type psoriasis patient candidate systemic treatment phototherapy . This study may also provide dose-finding information future pivotal study . The response treatment measure patient study 12 week treatment use PASI primary endpoint , also sPGA . Both instrument evaluate clinical severity plaque-type psoriatic lesion . Training PASI sPGA assessment provide order decrease inter-observer variability . The sPGA thus validated future phase 3 trial . After 12 week treatment , patient response equivalent good PASI50 satisfactory safety experience enter 12 week extension treatment period . The total time exposure study drug subgroup patient 24 week . All study patient terminate treatment study drug 12 week . In addition , durability remission/response , occurrence relapse rebound treatment study drug end treatment assess 8 week follow-up period . The follow-up period applicable study participant take least one dose study drug . It initiate last dose study medication take , irrespective duration patient actual treatment period . The trial use modify dose-escalation scheme . The randomisation 500 mg treatment arm initiate Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) decision safety treatment arm . An IVRS use randomisation trial . Ninety ( 90 ) patient require per dose group . With four group overall 1:1:1:1 randomisation scheme , total 360 eligible patient plan randomised treatment . Study Hypothesis : Psoriasis chronic inflammatory disease lead skin sore . These skin sore dependent rate growth skin drive underlie correspond degree local inflammation . The skin inflammation cause different cell type move blood vessel skin . This cell movement result interaction different protein . One proteins call LFA-1 ( Lymphocyte Function Associated Antigen 1 ) . LFA-1 promising target psoriasis therapy . BIRT 2584 XX block passage inflammatory cell blood skin block LFA-1 , thus indirectly block inflammatory process . BIRT 2584 XX also block activation local inflammatory cell , altogether may reduce sign symptoms psoriasis . A dose-dependent effect BIRT 2584 XX observe set marker blood believed correlate severity inflammatory process lead psoriasis . Comparison ( ) : In clinical study , BIRT 2584 XX dose 100 mg , 300 mg 500 mg , placebo give daily . Patients receive treatment throughout study . Patients 1 4 chance ( 25 % ) allocate placebo treatment . The placebo identical appearance compare one three dose group BIRT 2584 XX , contain active ingredient . The purpose comparison placebo ensure reliable assessment therapeutic effect side effect BIRT 2584 XX .</detailed_description>
