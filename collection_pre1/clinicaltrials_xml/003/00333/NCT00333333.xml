	<detailed_description>Thrombocytopenia common entity infant born mother preeclampsia infant small gestational age . There several theory mechanism underlie thrombocytopenia group patient . One mechanism suggest thrombocytopenia population may secondary underproduction platelet . Other study imply low platelet level may due endothelial activation cause platelet consumption . This study perform help determine mechanism cause thrombocytopenia infant born mother preeclampsia compare mechanism thrombocytopenia infant small gestational age .</detailed_description>
