	<brief_title>Predictors Response Cognitive Remediation Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It suggest level cognitive function `` rate-limiter '' efficacy psychosocial treatment schizophrenia . Cognitive remediation , entail train practice successively difficult cognitive exercise , show efficacy improve cognitive function . However , rate improvement uniform among patient receive intervention . Given time- cost-intensiveness cognitive remediation , important examine variable predict response treatment , well examine clinical significance improvement . The current proposal two aim : 1 ) determine neuropsychological , demographic , illness variable predict response cognitive remediation training ; 2 ) determine proportion patient whose performance return normal follow cognitive remediation training . For first part propose study , 50 outpatient diagnose schizophrenia spectrum disorder invite participate 8-week trial cognitive remediation training . Detailed neuropsychological , demographic , symptom illness course variable collect prior training , conclusion training , 4 month study intake . In order answer second question , additional data computerize task performance healthy control collect , compare patient data , order determine constitute normal-range performance</detailed_description>
