	<detailed_description>There currently mobility option veterans mobility impairment visual impairment , population grow number old veteran 's increase . The goal project evaluate Smart Wheelchair Component System ( SWCS ) power wheelchair Smart Power Assistance Module ( SPAM ) manual wheelchair realistic indoor environment target user perform realistic task . We combine group trial involve individual visual impairment ( may may mobility impairment ) several single-case study involve individual visual mobility impairment . The key question address propose research : Can smart wheelchair technology improve performance realistic navigation task individual visual mobility impairment ? Will smart wheelchair technology increase amount independent travel individual visual mobility impairment ? Will use smart wheelchair extend period time diminish person 's ability operate `` traditional '' wheel mobility aid ?</detailed_description>
