	<brief_title>Pilot Trial Neural Correlates Response Treatment PTSD-Associated Impulsive Aggression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective One : One study objective evaluate potential effect size phenytoin cognitive behavioral therapy PTSD-related impulsive aggression . Hypothesis : Phenytoin cognitive behavioral therapy hypothesize effective treatment PTSD-related impulsive aggression base study previously outline . Plan : Patients enrol pilot study randomize receive eight-week course treatment phenytoin cognitive behavioral therapy Trauma Recovery Program Veterans â€™ Affairs Medical Center Houston , Texas . Objective Two : Another study objective begin attempt delineate potential neural correlate treatment-related reduction PTSD-related impulsive aggression . Hypothesis : Potential neural correlate treatment-related reduction intensity and/or severity impulsive-aggressive act hypothesize include change : 1 ) thalamic activation reflect effective thalamic sensory gating , anticipation increase activation thalamus post-treatment 2 ) activation brain region associate verbal information processing , anticipation increase activation region post-treatment 3 ) activation prefrontal region , include anticipation increase activation medial and/or orbital prefrontal cortex post-treatment , 4 ) amygdalar activation , anticipation decrease activation amygdala post-treatment 5 ) hippocampal activation , anticipation increase activation hippocampus post-treatment , and/or , 6 ) right-left hemispheric dissociation brain processing stimulus , anticipation great degree bilaterality brain processing stimuli post-treatment . Specifically , great degree activation leave hemispheric brain structure anticipate post-treatment fMRI scan . Plan : Patients PTSD-associated impulsive aggression undergo eight-week course treatment phenytoin CBT . Treatment-related change impulsive-aggressive act correlate change brain activation compare pre- post-treatment fMRI scan utilizing standardized Go-No Go task use study impulsive aggressive individual .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria group righthanded adult combat veteran age 18 meet criterion PTSD via Structured Clinical Interview ( SCIDI , First , 2002 ) Impulsive Aggression primary diagnosis . To include study designation Impulsive Aggression , patient must commit least three aggressive act precede three month meet criterion impulsive aggressive act Impulsive/Premeditated Aggression Scales ( IPAS ) criterion ( Stanford et al 2003 ) base semistructured interview patient his/her significant . An impulsive aggressive act define hairtrigger , nonpremeditated response stimulus result immediate aggressive act agitate state culminates aggressive act , clearly disproportionate trigger stimulus . Inclusion criterion group also include availability participation significant participate study . The significant need accompany study participant initial assessment interview complete measure aggressive act commit study participant three month prior start study , aggressive act previous two week twoweek interval followup visit throughout eightweek treatment period . Exclusion Criteria group include exclusion criterion MRI scanning , know claustrophobia require sedation past MRI scan . MRI exclusion criterion include metallic implant , implanted device kind , cardiac pacemaker , cardiac defibrillator , insulin pump , vagal nerve stimulator , cochlear implant , metallic splinter eye , ferromagnetic clip metal head brain ( previous injury head/brain surgery include brain aneurysm clip ) , lead wire kind , clip stint anywhere body , clip arterial aneurysm clipping , stint cardiac artery artery anywhere body , prosthetic heart valve , stapedial implant kind ( implant inner ear ) .</criteria>
