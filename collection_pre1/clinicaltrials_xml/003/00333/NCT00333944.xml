	<detailed_description>Standard treatment organophosphorus pesticide poison involves administration intravenous atropine oxime counter acetylcholinesterase inhibition.1 Treatment atropine well establish , efficacy dosage schedule oximes controversial.2-5 A dose 1g every four six hour standard regimen Asian district hospital many clinician remain unconvinced effectiveness.3 Randomised control trial ( RCT ) perform Vellore ninety compare 12g infusion 3-4 day 1g bolus dose placebo.6,7 The author report benefit pralidoxime increase mortality receive infusion , state pralidoxime give organophosphorus poisoned patients.2 Others consider dosage regimen ideal , therapeutic concentration obtain rarely treatment.3,4 Furthermore , many patient present late take dimethyl pesticides - class respond well oximes several hour - biasing study find benefit . The propose minimum effective plasma level pralidoxime 4 mg/L base vitro animal experiment Sundwall.8 Recent evidence , however , suggest high blood concentration pralidoxime need antagonise toxic effect many pesticide bolus load infusion follow maintenance infusion would best regimen.9 The WHO propose patient receive around 30mg/kg pralidoxime salt load dose follow infusion least 8mg/kg/hr ( roughly equivalent 1-2 g bolus follow 0Â·5 g/h 50kg south Asian patient ) .9,10 However , trial yet perform determine whether regimen reduces morbidity mortality severely poison patients.3 Since organophosphorus pesticide kill hundred thousand people rural Asia every year , essential determine whether benefit harm poison patient . Our hospital typically use regimen 1g q4h organophosphorus poison patient unconvinced effectiveness expensive drug since many patient require ventilation &gt; 10 day . We informally treat several patient WHO-recommended regimen saw little benefit . Since pralidoxime high therapeutic index , decide conduct RCT still high dos , i.e . compare 1 g infusion every hour ( q1h , 24 g/day ) 1g every four hour ( q4h , 6 g/day ) , 2 g load dose , assess effectiveness high dose pralidoxime organophosphorus poison patient .</detailed_description>
