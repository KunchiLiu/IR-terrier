	<brief_title>Pulmonary Involvement Scleroderma : A Clinical Study Safety Efficacy Mycophenolate Mofetil Scleroderma Patients With Lung Involvement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study design evaluate safety efficacy mycophenolate mofetil ( CellCept ) treatment symptomatic pulmonary alveolitis due systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) . This study utilize prospective , open-label , experimental design . Primary Hypothesis : The alveolitis patient SSc , define decrease forced vital capacity ( FVC ) , bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) , High Resolution Chest Tomography ( HRCT ) responsive 1 year daily mycophenolate mofetil therapy . Secondary Hypothesis : Quality life , six-minute walk single-breath diffuse capacity carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) improve patient SSc mediate alveolitis therapy mycophenolate mofetil . This response therapy associate change inflammatory cytokine profile present BAL fluid .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To participate study , patient must first undergo BAL HRCT . To eligible undergo HRCT BAL ( purview trial ) , prospective patient must meet following criterion : Aged 2170 . Negative pregnancy test ( sensitivity least 50 mIU/mL ) females childbearing potential All patient must fulfill criterion SSc American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) criterion ( Subcommittee Scleroderma Criteria 1980 ) . FVC &lt; 85 % predict . SSc 7 year onset define date first nonRaynaud manifestation . Patients may limit ( cutaneous thicken distal proximal elbow knee , without facial involvement ) diffuse ( cutaneous thicken proximal elbow knee , often involve chest abdomen ) cutaneous SSc ( Medsger 1995 ) . Abnormal DLCO abnormality plain chest radiograph require , although normal DLCO would unusual face significant ventilatory restriction due SSc lung disease . To eligible take study medication , patient must meet criterion , also must ≥ 3.0 % neutrophils ≥ 2.0 % eosinophil screen BAL fluid and/or ground glass opacification HRCT . Women childbearing potential negative serum urine pregnancy test sensitivity least 50 mIU/mL within 1 week begin therapy . CellCept therapy initiate report negative pregnancy test obtain . Effective contraception must use begin CellCept therapy , therapy , 6 week follow discontinuation therapy , even history infertility , unless due hysterectomy . Two reliable form contraception must use simultaneously unless abstinence choose method . If pregnancy occur treatment , physician patient discus desirability continue pregnancy . FVC &lt; 45 % predict DLCO ( correct hemoglobin [ Hgb ] alveolar volume ) &lt; 35 % predict ( suggestive severe , probably irreparable , disease ) . Leukopenia ( white blood cell count &lt; 4000 ) thrombocytopenia ( platelet count &lt; 100,000 ) . Serum creatinine ≥ 2.0 mg/dl . Pregnancy , breast feeding , unreliability , drug abuse , chronic debilitate disease . Uncontrolled congestive heart failure . Active infection lung , elsewhere , whose management would compromise mycophenolate mofetil . Prior treatment alveolitis mycophenolate mofetil prior current treatment alveolitis : Dpenicillamine , methotrexate , colchicine , Potaba , azathioprine . Other serious concomitant medical illness ( e.g. , cancer ) . Forced expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) /FVC ratio &lt; 65 % . If childbearing potential , failure regularly employ two reliable mean contraception ( i.e. , condom , abstinence , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , tubal ligation , vasectomy ) Pulmonary hypertension ( define estimate systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) ≥ 35 mmHg measure echocardiogram ) . Smoking cigar , pipe , cigarette past 6 month . Clinically significant abnormality chest xray HRCT scan interstitial lung disease ( e.g. , lung mass , evidence active pulmonary infection ) . Use prednisone ( equivalent ) dose &gt; 10 mg per day . Does ≥ 3.0 % neutrophils ≥ 2.0 % eosinophil screen BAL fluid ground glass opacification HRCT . Unable take oral medication . Not able comply study procedure opinion investigator .</criteria>
