	<brief_summary>To determine rate thromboembolic complication ( include death attribute thromboembolic disease ) patient score rat `` DVT likely '' formalize scoring system , anticoagulation therapy withhold basis negative comprehensive duplex ultrasound examination .

	<detailed_description>Design : Prospective clinical cohort study . Patients : 193 sequentially enrolled patient evaluate suspected symptomatic deep vein thrombosis leg , report LDS Hospital Intermountain Medical Center Peripheral Vascular Laboratory . Vascular technician screen patient study entry simple questionnaire . Those meet screen criterion interview study coordinator verify meet inclusion criterion , exclusion , provide inform consent . Demographic medical history information : Study clinical variable obtain enroller interview electronic medical record entry include computerized clinical database . They include age , sex , weight , inclusion exclusion criterion , clinical information necessary create pre-test clinical score . Demographic information basic biometrics ( gender , height , weight , leg circumference ) obtain record study coordinator . Informed consent document obtain store accord policy Institutional Review Board . All female patient undergo urine serum pregnancy test prior study entry . Measurements : A research clinician perform brief clinical assessment specific determine pre-test probability DVT prior evaluation diagnostic test . This formalize scoring system validate prior study . Patients clinical score `` DVT unlikely '' undergo comprehensive duplex ultrasonography . If normal , patient follow clinical event describe . Patients study ( comprise group lower pre-test probability DVT ) go diagnostic testing care refer physician . Demographic information use descriptive portion study demonstrate risk prevalence , patient follow clinical outcome . The scoring system determine pre-test probability describe Wells et al . Patients score correspond `` DVT Unlikely '' test treat accord treat clinician , follow outcome . Comprehensive , real-time B-mode ultrasonography color Doppler analysis ( CDU ) perform patient pre-test probability `` DVT Likely . '' A standardized technique use CDU examination . Compressibility vein assess . The result categorize normal imaged venous segment fully compressible , abnormal noncompressible segment identify , inadequate interpretation . Interpretation perform experienced vascular surgery staff accord protocol currently use LDS Hospital Intermountain Medical Center . Findings redact specific data field interpret surgeon accord form generate purpose . The form complete interpret surgeon add patient logbook entry database data entry clerk . Interobserver variability limit use priori criterion positive negative study use interpreter privilege Intermountain Healthcare interpret vascular study , substantial experience expertise . Interobserver agreement technique find high . If result initial CDU normal ( DVT identify ) , anticoagulation withheld , regardless symptom . If result test abnormal ( DVT identify ) , anticoagulation give unless contraindicate , accord establish protocol . Subjects whose result classify inadequate interpretation reason log exclude analysis . They receive management accord discretion emergency physician . Long-Term Follow-up Patients observation cohort ( negative CDU ) undergo three month clinical follow-up , strategy use many diagnostic trial DVT . Patients instructed return immediately emergency department symptom sign venous thrombosis pulmonary embolism . A thromboembolic disease specialist ass 3 month telephone interview . At follow-up assessment , interval history take emphasis specific symptom ( include leg pain , tenderness swelling , chest pain , dyspnea , hemoptysis , syncope ) , hospitalization , interval evaluation DVT PE use anticoagulant . For patient die , cause death determine autopsy independent clinical review autopsy obtain . Results follow-up assessment enter data sheet assess clinician create purpose . This sheet add logbook study coordinator information append database data entry clerk . The evaluate clinician refer patient appropriate test thromboembolic disease base clinical suspicion . Patients suspect deep vein thrombosis refer compression ultrasonography . If CDU abnormal , patient treat anticoagulation therapy . If normal , patient refer venography ( current gold standard test ) exclude diagnosis DVT . Patients suspect pulmonary embolism undergo objective test ventilation-perfusion lung scanning , indicate , pulmonary angiography high-resolution compute tomography . Qualified physician blind subject 's cohort perform interpretation test . Main Outcome Measures Statistical Comparisons : Primary outcome measure venous thrombosis , pulmonary embolism ( VTE ) death thromboembolic disease follow-up confirm objective test 3 month follow enrollment . The study design estimate event rate thromboembolic disease death attributable thromboembolic disease normal cohort three-month follow-up period . An exact 95 % confidence interval excludes rate VTE 3 % define clinically acceptable , accordance previous trial DVT diagnosis . Adjudication outcomes : A panel three independent physician establish expertise venous thromboembolism name adjudicate suspect event VTE diagnostic test VTE occur follow-up period . Simple majority resolve dispute . Methodological Issues Avoidance Bias Entering consecutive patient study avoid selection bias . To avoid bias initial test period , establish pre-defined criterion negative positive study . Further diagnostic test patient negative result undertaken unless dictate follow-up evaluation . Patients observation cohort treat therapy give patient positive result . Diagnostic suspicion bias avoid objectively test patient return follow-up symptom sign suggestive deep venous thrombosis pulmonary embolism . Interpretation bias avoid obtain independent interpretation follow-up testing patient suspect disease . The interpreter blind result initial ultrasound cohort patient belongs . All death independently review . The reviewer blind cohort patient belongs . Patient confidentiality maintain keep patient identity log separate database , use unique numerical identifier . Complete data track assure comparison enrollment log database independent reviewer . Statistical Analysis Sample Size Descriptive statistic age , sex , symptom presentation ( pain , tenderness , duration symptom ) , clinical condition ( recent surgery , recent hospitalization , cancer , congestive heart failure , recent immobilization , recent childbirth , cellulitis , superficial phlebitis family history thromboembolic disease ) pre-test probability score calculate characterize study population . The event rate thromboembolic complication death thromboembolic disease calculate patient two observation cohort . A two-sided confidence interval event rate ( objectively verify venous thromboembolism ) calculate observation cohort exact method . If confidence interval exclude commonly accept threshold event rate 3 % , conclude diagnostic strategy clinically valid . We also describe clinical characteristic clot endpoint data available . The sample size 193 patient meet eligibility criterion choose exact 95 % confidence interval would exclude event rate venous thromboembolism observation cohort 3 % . Excluding event rate 3 % commonly accept standard diagnostic strategy deem clinically acceptable .</detailed_description>
