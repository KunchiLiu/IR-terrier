Subjects must measurable evaluable disease . Subjects must receive prior chemotherapy radiation &gt; /= 4 week prior first dose study drug . Subjects may enter receive prior radiation therapy involve &lt; /= 30 % bone marrow . Any prior radiation therapy must administer &gt; /= 4 week prior first dose study drug subject must recover acute toxic effect treatment prior study entry . Subjects may enrol history treat brain metastasis clinically stable &gt; /= 4 week prior first dose study drug . Subjects may currently receive dexamethasone . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 . Life expectancy great 12 week . Subjects must acceptable organ marrow function screen predose visit . Electrocardiogram without evidence clinically significant conduction abnormality active ischemia determine investigator acceptable QTc interval . The effect CRLX101 develop human fetus unknown , therefore , woman childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception prior study entry duration study participation .
