	<brief_summary>Diabetic macular oedema characterize fluid accumulation retinal tissue leak retinal vessel , capillary . This state lead severe visual loss blindness . According basic physiologic rule several factor influence fluid transport capillary surround tissue . One factor balance large molecule within vessel lumen retinal tissue . Some drug change balance , osmotic balance , move fluid tissue vessel lumen . In relation diabetic macular oedema , treatment drug potentially would reduce retinal thickness extract fluid retinal tissue . Glycerol potential . If reduction thickness glycerol confirm , prove significance osmotic balance basic nature diabetic macular oedema . In study therefore examine time dependent change retinal thickness glycerol intake instrument call optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) . The participant drink glycerol thickness retina monitor closely OCT follow three hour . Since diabetic change retina focal pr . definition , secondary purpose study find regional difference response . The examination repeat second visit patient drink another dose glycerol , also want analyse dose dependent response . Which dose give visit randomise beforehand . In addition measure retinal thickness variety examination perform study , e.g . blood sample systemic blood pressure measurement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quantification Rising Osmotic Pressure Diabetic Intraretinal Fluid Accumulation ( Diabetic Macular Oedema )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In general , oedema present , increase osmotic pressure retinal capillary osmotic drug induces transcapillary fluid transport retinal tissue vascular lumen , accord Starling equation . Theoretically , diabetic macular oedema event would lead reduction retinal thickness , could visualise Optical Coherence Tomography . The main purpose trial therefore evaluate quantify change retinal thickness oedema increase intracapillary osmotic pressure glycerol ingestion . A reduction retinal thickness confirm application Starling osmotic force diabetic macular oedema . Secondly , want describe regional difference retinal response analyse dose dependent variation . Principles material method : A prospective , randomize , clinical trial 15 patient diabetic significant macular oedema . At baseline patient undergo thorough ophthalmologic examination include ETDRS visual acuity , slit lamp biomicroscopy , Optical Coherence Tomography ( Stratus-OCT ) , 7-field fundus photography follow fluorescein angiography . In addition systemic blood pressure measure blood sample take rule severe renal insufficiency estimate glycosylated haemoglobin . The patient randomise drink either 1.5 3 mL glycerol/kg body weight ( max . 250 mL pr day ) first two visit date . The last dose give second visit . In follow three hour retinal thickness monitor closely Stratus-OCT glycerol ingestion . The plasma osmolality plasma triglyceride ( indirect indicator glycerol ) confirm venous blood sample , also predetermine time last swallow glycerol . In addition systemic blood pressure capillary blood glucose monitor closely visit .</detailed_description>
