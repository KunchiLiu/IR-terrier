	<detailed_description>This two-year proof-of-concept study evaluate new Virtual Reality ( VR ) `` holographic '' sound system use audiological Orientation Mobility ( O &amp; M ) train tool . This new system avoids limitation technology ( i.e. , binaural recording exist VR sound system ) employ limited success audiological training . Four advancement state-of-the-art represent new holographic system provide new promise audiological O &amp; M training . First , unlike binaural system , new system allow person move head natural fashion localize sound . Second , spherical microphone array use record sound environment retain direction ambient sound originate . When record sound environment later present head-tracking headphone VR environment , real-time software maintain directionality sound remain true matter person move turn head . Third , new system model actual physical acoustic structure person 's head ears present sound would hear particular person record setting . Fourth , system use software algorithms isolate specific sound ( i.e. , move vehicle ) virtual playback , sound inserted virtual sound field customizable fashion create truly unique flexible virtual sound presentation . There two study hypothesis . First , use sound negotiate traffic intersection , skill employ experienced traveler real environment readily transfer propose VR environment extent audiological task perform real environment easily perform VR environment . Second , VR environment enhance emphasize critical sound cue eliminate distract confuse noise sound , performance skilled traveler VR environment significantly well actual environment . The objective : ( 1 ) adapt exist spherical microphone array digital recording software algorithms best suit capture critical intersection sound use intersection negotiation ; ( 2 ) develop software algorithms deconstruct intersection sound , isolate sound VR construction specific environment vary complexity ; ( 3 ) determine level sound detail necessary negotiating intersection successfully ; ( 4 ) expand exist system obtain desired level detail ; ( 5 ) develop software provide ability control relative emphasis variety sound element present simplify auditory task ; ( 6 ) employ study participant compare performance VR environment outdoor performance . Once validate , system able : ( 1 ) leverage instructor time provide student effective mean practice audiological skill , ( 2 ) provide instructor mean introduce concept graduate learn sequence dependent happenstance availability specific sound condition find real environment , ( 3 ) provide audiological training environment locate vicinity training site , represent veteran 's home community . Research conduct collaboration investigator Perceptual Interfaces Reality Laboratory ( PIRL ) University Maryland initially conceive developed holographic VR sound system . COMPARISONS : Outdoor O &amp; M training exclusively</detailed_description>
