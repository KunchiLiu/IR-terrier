	<brief_summary>Patients within intensive care unit severe infection cause shock kidney failure almost 60 % risk die despite antibiotic therapy , surgical drainage site infection intensive care support fluid , nutrition , mechanical ventilation continuous artificial kidney support . This persistently high death rate continue stimulate development new approach treatment septic shock . Much clinical molecular biology research suggest patient die uncontrolled immune system ’ response infection . This response involve production several substance ( call “ humoral mediator ” ) , enter blood stream affect patient 's organ ability function patient 's ability kill germ . These substance may potentially remove new artificial filter similar currently use continuous hemofiltration ( type artificial kidney support use intensive care ) . Recent investigation others , however , make follow finding : 1 . Standard filter currently use intensive care ineffective remove large amount “ humoral mediator ” hole filter small allow pas 2 . The standard filter currently use intensive care also ineffective remove large amount “ humoral mediator ” standard filtration flow membrane le 100 ml/min 3 . When filtration flow membrane increase 100ml/min , patient require less dose drug support blood pressure indirect sign filter clear `` humoral mediator '' 4 . Even blood flow standard filter increase 100ml/min , still optimal clear `` humoral mediator '' It possible , however , , use different filter membrane big hole , would make easy clear blood `` humoral mediator '' . It think would noticeable clinically amount drug require support blood pressure . A filter big hole available . It make material standard filter currently use intensive care unit , hole make big allow `` humoral mediator '' remove blood . This polyamide filter make synthetic semipermeable material . This material highly compatible human blood . This modify polyamide filter make exactly compatible material hole material slightly large minor modification manufacturing process . This large hole filter use preliminary study human find reduce blood level `` humoral mediator '' . Laboratory study conduct show new filter achieve high report clearance `` humoral mediator '' minimal effect useful protein blood albumin hemodialysis . This loss small unlikely contribute detectable clinical change . We , therefore , propose study effect use new large hole filter hemodialysis patient severe infection acute kidney failure . We wish compare effect new therapy standard filter . The new therapy consider effective lower amount drug use support blood pressure lower blood level `` humoral mediator '' standard therapy . We also monitor blood level important component blood albumin electrolyte group . This pilot study involve 10 patient receive 4 hour standard therapy 4 hour new therapy . Which treatment patient receive first random ( like toss coin ) . Blood sample take start 4 hour treatment . The waste product dialysis call spent dialysate also collect measurement humoral mediator start 4 hour treatment . The change blood pressure drug use support record hourly . As patient involve study would normally receive hemofiltration kidney failure , risk benefit associate procedure would unchanged . The risk patient would come exposure modify membrane two additional spoonful blood take . If new membrane find major effect blood level `` humoral mediator '' patient ’ blood pressure , study would justify assess clinical effect ( time ICU , time hospital , time ventilator , duration organ failure , etc ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Super High-Flux - High Volume Dialysis Sepsis-Induced Acute Renal Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE The combination acute renal failure ( ARF ) sepsis associate high morbidity mortality ( 1 ) . Accordingly , many attempt develop good treatment condition . Much clinical molecular biology research suggest septic shock occurs uncontrolled immune system ’ response infection ( 2-13 ) . This response involve production several substance ( call “ humoral mediator ” ) , enter blood stream , different time course patient ’ illness , cause either severe inflammation profound depression immune system ’ ability kill microbe . The vast majority substance ( cytokine , complement anaphylatoxins , platelet activate factor , leukotrienes , chemokines ) , responsible state “ blood poison ” water soluble small middle molecular weight ( 40 kilodaltons ) . These property make potentially removal artificial membrane similar use continuous hemofiltration ( type artificial kidney support use intensive care ) . It possible use different porous membrane , removal cytokine would much efficient clinical benefit blood purification would , therefore , great . A membrane kind available . It modification ( moderate increase pore size ) standard material call polyamide , already use million people dialysis hemofiltration . This large pore polyamide membrane use preliminary study human ( 14 ) find capable lower blood level marker cytokine ( interleukin-6 , molecular weight : 26.2 kD ) . In laboratory study conduct , new polyamide membrane achieve high reported cytokine beta2-Microglobulin - another marker removal middle molecule - clearance literature associate negligible loss albumin ( 15 ) . Recent investigation others , however , make follow finding : 1 . Standard membrane limit effectiveness filter “ humoral mediator ” ( 16 ) 2 . Unless high volume plasma-water exchange apply ( 100 ml/min ) , effect blood purification blood level mediator minimal ( 17-20 ) 3 . High volume hemofiltration standard membrane , result improvement state circulation infusion drug use support blood pressure ( noradrenaline ) decrease ( 20 ) . 4 . Even high volume hemofiltration removal “ humoral mediator ” cytokine still limited efficiency ( 20 ) It possible use different porous membrane , removal cytokine would much efficient clinical benefit blood purification would , therefore , great . A membrane kind available . It modification ( moderate increase pore size ) standard material call polyamide , already use million people dialysis hemofiltration . We , therefore , propose study effect combine hemodialysis new polyamide membrane large pore treatment patient sepsis acute kidney failure . We wish compare effect new therapy hemodialysis standard membrane . The term comparison ( outcome measure ) : A ) . The effect therapy blood concentration several cytokine ( TNF-alpha , IL-1 beta , Il-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 ) . B ) . The effect therapy blood concentration beta2-Microglobulin another marker removal middle molecule . C ) . The effect therapy blood pressure need noradrenaline infusion , safety assessment D ) . The effect therapy blood concentration albumin electrolytes If new membrane find major effect blood concentration cytokine patient ’ blood pressure , study would justify assess clinical effect ( time ICU , time hospital , time ventilator , duration organ failure , etc ) trial . STUDY OBJECTIVE The aim study compare effect hemodialysis combine large pore membrane hemodialysis standard membrane 1. serum concentration several cytokine ( efficacy assessment ) 2. serum concentration clearance rate beta2- Microglobulin ( efficacy assessment ) 3. blood pressure noradrenaline requirement ( efficacy assessment ) 4. serum concentration albumin electrolyte ( safety assessment ) NULL HYPOTHESIS The use hemodialysis combine large pore membrane effect serum cytokine beta2-Microglobulin level , blood pressure noradrenaline requirement compare hemodialysis standard membrane . STUDY DESIGN This study phase I/II equivalent investigation . It pilot , randomise , crossover , control study . Eligible patient receive treatment . However , order treatment ( first treatment A B vice versa ) allocate random fashion ( computer generate random number ) . After complete first treatment , patient cross alternative treatment . Treatments consist either : A ) hemodialysis new polyamide ( P2SH ) membrane 4 hour B ) hemodialysis standard polyamide membrane Blood sample ( serum cytokine beta2-Microglobulin measurement ) start treatment 4 hour treatment . Dialysate also collect measurement cytokine beta2-Microglobulin order calculate cytokine beta2-Microglobulin clearance . The change blood pressure noradrenaline dose record hourly routine Intensive Care . Patient treatment otherwise continue accord clinical need standard ICU care . It important note patient involve study would normally receive standard hemofiltration anyway kidney failure , risk benefit associate procedure ( insertion double lumen catheter , extracorporeal circulation , anticoagulation ) . As part study , however , also receive increased intensity treatment , 4 hour exposure modify membrane additional blood sampling ( one spoonful ) . It possible effect first therapy would cross second . To control crossover effect , statistical comparison undertaken accord order treatment well type treatment , recently publish . ( 23 ) STUDY POPULATION All patient fulfil consensus criterion sepsis ( 21 ) recently propose criterion severe ARF ( 1 ) eligible study . SPECIFIC EXCLUSIONS - Patients 18 year age . - Patients pregnant breastfeed - Patients know allergy polyamide - Patients expect die within 24 hour - Patients limitation intensity therapy ENROLMENT Once patient eligibility establish informed consent seek next kin . If informed consent obtain , patient enrol study . The ICU research nurse responsible enrolment subsequent data collection . STUDY PROTOCOL Following enrolment randomisation , patient allocate either treatment A B . An extracorporeal circuit set dialysis Fresenius 2008 machine . The difference , one filter apply , large pore polyamide filter . The filter whic apply , standard polyamide filter . Each treatment apply 4 hour . After treatment , extracorporeal circuit flush Hartmann ’ solution membrane change alternative material ( cross ) . For treatment , follow technical setting apply : 1 . Blood flow 200 ml/min 2 . Dialysate flow 300 ml/min 3 . Anticoagulation filter prefilter heparin , necessary ( e.g . 1,000 IU/hr ) 4 . Bicarbonate-buffered dialysate After completion 2 period 4 hour hemodialysis , patient revert standard therapy ( hemofiltration AN 69 membrane 2 L/hr plasma water exchange ) continue normal treatment . Randomisation Concealment The randomisation base random number generate computer . The allocation either treatment A B first treatment place opaque envelope independent person . Once consent obtain , envelope open treatment initiate . Filters blind identical appearance , outline `` Filter A '' `` Filter B '' , respectively , label stick filter . For reason patient safety , filter monitoring membrane clot require filter visualized time . EXPECTED SIZE OF TREATMENT DIFFERENCE This study design detect 30 % decrease IL-6 level . From previous similar investigation ( 19 ) , also assume standard deviation equal size effect test . Using non-parametric paired comparison statistic ( Wilcoxon rank sign test ) , sample 10 patient would offer &gt; 80 % power detect 30 % difference alpha 0.05 ( 22 ) . CLINICAL OUTCOMES AND DATA ANALYSIS Primary analysis perform basis intention treat . Secondary analysis perform per protocol analysis . The primary outcome measure study clearance change IL-6 level The secondary outcome clearance change level cytokines beta2-Microglobulin . The secondary outcome change noradrenaline dose require maintain baseline mean blood pressure ( typically 70 mmHg ) Treatment group analyse difference IL-6 level 4 hour treatment . It expect clinical observation criterion normal distribution violate . Therefore comparison perform use non-parametric test ( Wilcoxon rank sign test ) . Statistical significance set p &lt; 0.05 . The group also test difference secondary outcome variable . Such secondary outcome variable : 1 . Absolute change serum cytokine level cytokine beta2-Microglobulin 2 . Percentage change noradrenaline dose 3 . Change blood pressure pre-treatment value value 4 hour treatment 4 . Percentage change serum cytokine level cytokine Using primary outcome variable , study 80 % power detect 30 % difference alpha &lt; 0.05 . It expect clinical observation recruitment 10 patient take 3 month . Data Collection Data collection Intensive Care Dept . research nurse research fellow .
