	<brief_summary>Type 1 Diabetes ( T1D ) autoimmune disease . This mean immune system ( part body help fight infection ) mistakenly attack destroys cell produce insulin ( islet cell find pancreas ) . As cell destroy , body 's ability produce insulin decrease . The autoimmune process think initiate gene-environment interaction . The genetics involve development T1D fairly well understood . There high risk develop T1D presence human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) DR3 DR4 . It also know everyone gene actually develop T1D . Therefore , one environmental factor think contribute process develop T1D . The consumption anti-inflammatory fatty acid , omega-3 fatty acid , decrease significantly past 100 year . At time rise incidence T1D , especially young child occur . Because warning eliminate fish pregnancy , pregnant woman consume even less omega-3 fatty acid fetal development . Observations make child receive omega-3 fatty acid supplementation low risk T1D . Omega-3 fatty acid could protective effect may occur pregnancy , infancy , . The mechanism protection may due DHA mediated suppression inflammatory response . Patients high risk T1D increase pro-inflammatory environment . We hypothesize DHA supplementation pregnancy early childhood block initial pro-inflammatory event prevent development islet cell autoimmunity child high risk T1D . This study feasibility study determine full-scale DHA supplementation study implement . If full study implement , primary outcome determine nutritional supplementation omega-3 fatty acid last trimester mother 's pregnancy and/or first three year life child high risk T1D prevent development islet autoimmunity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There two possible entry pathway study participant . The first pathway entry point pregnant mother third trimester ( 24 week gestational age ) whose baby may high risk T1D base family history . At birth , soon , baby test HLA type ( look specific gene confers higher risk develop T1D ) . If HLA typing show baby high risk T1D protective gene present , baby continue study . The second pathway entry point baby whose mother enrol pregnancy . These baby also test HLA type . Their eligibility base presence high risk gene presence multiplex family history . This screen process may take place baby 5 month old . Eligible participant ( pregnant woman infant ) randomize one two study group : DHA ( docosahexaenoic acid ) study substance ( intervention ) control study substance ( placebo ) . The DHA ( docosahexaenoic acid ) use trial produce algae , fish oil , risk mercury pesticide contamination . Pregnant nursing mother assign control group receive study capsule contain vegetable oil DHA ( docosahexaenoic acid ) . Pregnant nursing mother assign experimental group receive study capsule contain DHA ( docosahexaenoic acid ) . During pregnancy breastfeeding , infant receive study substance indirectly mother ( either placenta breastmilk ) . Infants either partially exclusively formula feed receive study substance directly study formula . The control group receive study formula contain typical amount DHA find infant formula , infant experimental group receive study formula contain large amount DHA ( docosahexaenoic acid ) typically find infant formula . By six twelve month age , infant get study supplement add solid food . All mother contact study site every 3 month . Nursing mother provide sample breast milk fatty acid analysis visit . Infants need come follow-up study visit every 6 month . At visit , infant limit physical exam blood drawn vein monitor immune activity , level fatty acid vitamin D , check diabetes-related autoantibody . Infants/children continue study : ( 1 ) develop two positive autoantibody , present two consecutive visit , ( 2 ) develop T1D . All follow-up study visit continue 1-2 year , possibly additional 2 year full-scale study initiate .</detailed_description>
