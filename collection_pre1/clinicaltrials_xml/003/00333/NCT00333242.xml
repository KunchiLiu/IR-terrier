	<brief_title>Hyperalgesia Methadone Patients : Can Treated ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Addressing undertreatment clinical pain become national priority , central goal identify effective intervention subgroups patient risk suffer unrelieved pain ( NIH Program Announcement PA-01-115 ) . In fact , undertreatment pain recently rule form patient abuse California court award one million dollar damage family patient . Novel data accumulate investigative group show patient maintain mu-opioid agonist , methadone , treatment addiction , significantly hyperalgesic cold-pressor experimental pain compare normal control . This diminished pain tolerance , addition contextual prohibition associate provide know opioid addict opioid analgesic , make population uniquely vulnerable undertreatment pain . Unfortunately , little known best manage pain suffer 120,000 methadone-maintained ( MM ) patient country , part hyperalgesia suffer appear akin neuropathic pain opioid-induced . In proposed series study , Principal Investigator ( first-time R01 applicant ) build upon previous study validate characterize hyperalgesia MM sample explore 's underlying mechanism pharmacological perspective . Utilizing slightly different double-blind , placebo-controlled design , propose work evaluate ability three class medication ( N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) -antagonists , adjuvant anticonvulsant analgesic , novel opioid analgesic ) diminish reverse opioid-induced hyperalgesia complicate pain state suffer MM patient . Specifically , sample MM patient , ( 1 ) dextromethorphan , interfere development opioid-induced hyperalgesia , ( 2 ) gabapentin , proven efficacy treat neuropathic pain , ( 3 ) oxycodone , novel opioid activity , evaluate ability ameliorate diminish opioid-induced hyperalgesia patient reflect change pain threshold tolerance cold-pressor electrical pain , peak trough methadone blood level . The result work provide pharmacologic insight mechanism underlie poor pain tolerance at-risk population , also direction medical management pain complicate opioid-induced hyperalgesia .</detailed_description>
