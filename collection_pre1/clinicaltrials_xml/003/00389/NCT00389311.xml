	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Toxicity Evaluation HIV Rectal Microbicides</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It currently know procedure use observe line distal colon , endoscopy without pinch biopsy , may cause mucosal trauma thus alter colonic permeability . Additionally , application topical HIV microbicides ( prevent HIV transmission ) shearing force associate rectal intercourse might also adversely affect epithelial layer , thus alter colonic permeability . In order appropriately interpret test effect topical HIV microbicides mucosal line distal colon , essential understand whether procedure , adversely affect epithelial layer . If change permeability detect , method may develop help determine microbicide distribution/toxicity early phase study , thus improve selection candidate microbicides study large scale clinical trial .</detailed_description>
