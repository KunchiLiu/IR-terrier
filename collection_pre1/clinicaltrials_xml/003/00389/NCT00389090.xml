	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Temozolomide O6-Benzylguanine ( O6-BG ) Patients With Temozolomide-Resistant Anaplastic Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , multicenter , phase II trial ass antitumor activity safety temozolomide combination O6-BG patient temozolomide-resistant anaplastic glioma . Forty-one 104 evaluable patient temozolomide-resistant anaplastic glioma enrol study . Total accrual study exceed 116 patient . The patient receive daily temozolomide 5 consecutive day ( day 1-5 ) along bolus infusion O6-BG day 1 , 3 , 5 continuous infusion O6-BG begin immediately first bolus infusion continue immediately prior last bolus injection . Patients evaluate AEs course therapy . Patients may receive treatment dose level appearance significant treatment-related toxicity , disease progression withdrawal consent . Tumor response evaluate end cycle 1 , cycle 2 every two cycle duration therapy , use physical neurological examination diagnostic imaging .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients histologically document anaplastic glioma ( anaplastic astrocytoma , anaplastic oligodendroglioma mixed anaplastic oligoastrocytoma ) . 2 . Temozolomideresistant define patient progressed receive within 8 week complete last dose temozolomide . 3 . Disease progression &gt; = 12 week completion radiotherapy . 4 . If patient receive chemotherapy investigational agent part prior therapy , patient must recover toxicity ( &lt; = Grade 1 ) prior enrollment protocol . 5 . Bidimensionally measurable disease contrastenhanced magnetic resonance imaging study ( MRI ) perform within two week study drug administration . 6 . If patient receive intratumoral chemotherapy immunotherapy part prior therapy histological confirmation recurrence mandate . 7 . KPS &gt; = 70 % . 8 . The following laboratory result : Absolute neutrophil count &gt; = 1500 cells/microliter Platelet count &gt; = 100,000 cells/microliter SGOT &lt; = 2.5 x ULN Serum creatinine &lt; = 1.5 x ULN 9 . Signed informed consent approve Institutional Review Board . 10 . If sexually active , patient take contraceptive measure duration treatment . 11 . For patient corticosteroid , must stable dose 1 week prior baseline MRI dose escalate entry dose level , clinically possible . 1 . Pregnant breast feed woman . 2 . Prior treatment O6BG plus temozolomide combination . 3 . Active infection require intravenous antibiotic . 4 . Known diagnosis Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) infection ( HIV test mandatory ) . 5 . Patients history another primary malignancy currently clinically significant currently require active intervention . 6 . Patients unwilling unable comply protocol . 7 . Patients receive stereotactic radiosurgery brachytherapy part prior therapy . 8 . Comedication may interfere study result ; eg . immunosuppressive agent corticosteroid .</criteria>
