	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine treadmill train body weight-support ( BWST ) effective improve walk individual post-stroke resist leg-cycling exercise program . In addition , want determine training program combine leg strength training treadmill walk provide additional benefit post-stroke walking outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Strength Training Effectiveness Post-Stroke ( STEPS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Impaired walk ability hallmark residual deficit contribute post-stroke walk disability . Impairment low extremity muscle strength significant contributor decrease walk speed stroke . No study combine task-specific locomotor training combination low extremity strength training program design improve post-stroke walk outcome . Participants include individual ambulatory , walk slow 1.0 m/sec least 6 month post unilateral stroke . Participants stratify initial comfortable walk speed ( moderate &gt; 0.5 m/sec ; severe &lt; = 0.5 m/sec ) randomize one four exercise pair : 1 ) body-weight support treadmill training ( BWST ) locomotor-based strength training ( resistive cycling task , LBST ) , 2 ) BWST LE muscle-specific strength training ( MSST ) , 3 ) BWST upper extremity ergometry ( SHAM ) , 4 ) LBST SHAM . Training occur 4 time per week 6 week ( 24 total session ) . Exercise type exercise pair alternate daily . Primary outcome include comfortable fast overground walk speed , distance walk 6-minutes measure baseline , 12 24 treatment session 6-month follow-up .</detailed_description>
