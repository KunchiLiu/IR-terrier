	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Lapatinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , vinorelbine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving lapatinib together vinorelbine may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose lapatinib give together vinorelbine treat patient advance solid tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine safety feasibility 2 different schedule lapatinib ditosylate administer vinorelbine ditartrate patient advance solid tumor . Secondary - Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) regimens patient . - Determine , preliminarily , efficacy regimens patient . - Examine tissue blood specimen patient investigate potential predictor response . - Determine pharmacokinetics lapatinib ditosylate vinorelbine ditartrate patient treat MTD . OUTLINE : This phase I study comprise 2 separate , sequential dose-escalation study lapatinib ditosylate . Patients assign 1 2 treatment group . - Group A ( daily dose ) : Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate daily day 1-28 vinorelbine ditartrate IV day 1 , 8 , 15 . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos lapatinib ditosylate maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 3 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity course 1 . At least 6 patient treated MTD . Once MTD lapatinib determine , patient may accrue group B separate pharmacokinetics cohort group A . - Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) cohort* : Patients PK cohort receive vinorelbine ditartrate IV group A oral lapatinib ditosylate daily MTD day 3-28 ( course 1 ) day 1-28 subsequent course . Patients undergo PK sample course 1 . NOTE : *Accrual group B PK cohort group A may occur simultaneously . - Group B ( intermittent dose ) : Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate daily MTD day 2-5 , 9-12 , 16-25 vinorelbine ditartrate IV , day 1 , 8 , 15 . In group PK cohort , treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients complete 6 course combine therapy may receive additional course lapatinib ditosylate alone . Patients undergo blood collection buccal brushing periodically pharmacokinetic biomarker correlative study . Archival tumor tissue also evaluate biomarkers , include epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) HER-2/neu expression level , EGFR polymorphisms gene mutation ( include RAS ) , level cellular proliferation apoptosis , RAS mutation immunohistochemistry , mutation analysis , TUNEL assay , polymerase chain reaction . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 66 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
