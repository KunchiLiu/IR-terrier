	<brief_summary>The main objective study ass change fat distribution 48 week treatment patient currently successfully use zidovudine ( AZT ) lamivudine ( 3TC ) part regimen either continue antiretrovirals switch antiretrovirals tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( TDF ) emtricitabine ( FTC ) . Each medication commonly use treatment HIV-1 infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Combinations two nucleoside analogue RT inhibitor ( NRTI ) far commonly utilized backbone combination antiretroviral regimens upon additional third fourth agent , non-nucleoside RT inhibitor ( NNRTI ) ( boost ) protease inhibitor ( PI ) , confer sufficient potency long-term efficacy . The choice specific two NRTI make basis potency durability , short-and long-term toxicity , drug-drug interaction , propensity select resistance mutation , dose convenience . Currently , frequently use NRTI combination zidovudine plus lamivudine , often co-formulated Combivir® . The thymidine analogues NRTI implicated pathogenesis lipodystrophy syndrome peripheral lipoatrophy particular . Exposure zidovudine associate slow possibly lesser degree limb fat loss exposure stavudine . The mechanisms thymidine analogue NRTI contribute lipoatrophy remain uncertain , although evidence drug-induced mitochondrial toxicity level subcutaneous adipose tissue involved2 3 . NRTI known inhibitor mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma great degree mtDNA depletion subcutaneous adipose tissue associate great loss limb fat measure DEXA . In addition , NRTI may detrimentally affect mitochondrial function mechanism mtDNA depletion . It also postulate normal regional distribution body fat may hypothalamic autonomic neuronal control , effect NRTI central and/or peripheral autonomic pathway may underlie selective loss fat subcutaneous central region body4 . Withdrawal thymidine analogues antiretroviral regimen patient clinical sign lipodystrophy ( replace abacavir recent study tenofovir ) demonstrate able partially revert limb fat loss number study , include randomize placebo-controlled trial 5-10 . Of note , patient study stavudine replace . Carr11 Martin6 report increase limb fat 0.39 kg 1.26 kg 24 104 week , respectively , replace stavudine zidovudine abacavir Mitox study ( majority patient stavudine-based regimen entry , minority ZDV-based regimen ) . Moyle8 report increase 1.08 kg limb fat 48 week withdrawal thymidine analogue . The reported increase limb fat great patient pretreated stavudine compare patient pretreated zidovudine . The rate peripheral fat loss slower patient use zidovudine compare patient use stavudine , suggest patient use stavudine may usually lose peripheral fat begin patient use zidovudine . Therefore potential increase peripheral fat withdrawal thymidine analogue expect great patient use stavudine . The current study , contrast earlier study , limited patient respect thymidine analogue exposure solely expose zidovudine never stavudine . In order assure participant study already opportunity lose reasonable amount peripheral fat , include patient continuously treat zidovudine lamivudine least 2 year . Nolan12 report treatment-naïve patient receive zidovudine-based therapy , 3 year lose average 31 % limb fat compare baseline12 . Patients continue use zidovudine appear continue progressively loose limb fat rate several percentage-points per year . By limit sample patient treat zidovudine lamivudine 2 year confident average loss limb fat large enough allow objectively measurable statistically significant regain limb fat occur discontinuation zidovudine lamivudine . Continued treatment zidovudine plus lamivudine expect result ( ) decrease mass peripheral adipose tissue . Switching emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate expect result increase least absence loss peripheral adipose tissue . The combination emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate attractive backbone antiretroviral combination therapy . This combination potent antiretroviral activity , favorable resistance profile , ease once-daily dosing , conveniently co-formulated single tablet , special food requirement , well tolerate , thus far particularly associate occurrence mitochondrial toxicity lipoatrophy . With respect latter , recent Gilead 903 trial informative sense limb fat wasting ( measure DEXA ) observe 96 144 week treatment oppose progressive limb fat loss see patient randomized stavudine-containing control arm13 . In study therefore aim demonstrate small statistically significant mean increase peripheral body fat patient switch emtricitabine tenofovir disoproxil fumarate oppose decrease peripheral fat patient continue use zidovudine lamivudine . Such increase peripheral fat expect observable treat physician patient . However , demonstration even small sub-clinical effect provide important information future patient management respect strategies best prevent progressive lipoatrophy . The Mitox study demonstrate substitute abacavir stavudine result increase limb fat 390 gram 24 weeks11 . This increase likewise noticeable clinician patient , could detect use DEXA scan . Nevertheless , result Mitox huge impact management patient : clinician start pro-actively substitute compound stavudine , exclude stavudine first-line regimen order prevent ( progression ) lipoatrophy . If study would demonstrate similar increase peripheral fat patient substitute emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate zidovudine lamivudine , could potentially likewise impact continue long-term use ZDV-based regimen . Although clean comparison would replace zidovudine tenofovir disoproxil fumarate , also replace lamivudine emtricitabine . Given expert agree difference lamivudine emtricitabine probably important emtricitabine additional advantage allow possible use fix dose daily combination emtricitabine tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ( Truvada® ) , choose replace lamivudine emtricitabine well . Purpose : Antiretroviral regimen contain emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate might associate low incidence severity lipoatrophy . In study compare effect proactively switch zidovudine lamivudine emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil fumarate peripheral fat loss continue lamivudine zidovudine-based treatment HIV-1 infect adult also receive non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( boost ) protease inhibitor . In patient discontinue use zidovudine switch emtricitabine tenofovir disoproxil fumarate expect demonstrate regaining least lack loss peripheral adipose tissue .</detailed_description>
