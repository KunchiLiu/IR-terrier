	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : AR-67 ( formerly DB-67 ) represent rationally engineer drug posse improve stability , toxicity , efficacy compare current Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) -approved camptothecins , base extensive research prior study . Therefore , investigator hypothesize AR-67 ( formerly DB-67 ) well-tolerated efficacious phase I clinical trial . This initial phase I trial establish maximum tolerate dose human , establish toxicity profile , define appropriate dose AR-67 ( formerly DB-67 ) future phase II III clinical trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Overview Study : Camptothecins potent class anticancer drug inhibit DNA topoisomerase I. Topotecan irinotecan two FDA approve second generation congener currently clinical use , spectrum activity include colorectal , ovarian , lung cancer . Unfortunately , drug hamper labile α-hydroxy-δ-lactone pharmacophore , hydrolyzes yield inactive carboxylate form drug . AR-67 ( formerly DB-67 ) ( 7-t-butyldimethylsilyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin ) third generation analog engineer blood stable highly potent . Its enhanced stability result two factor : ( 1 ) AR-67 ( formerly DB-67 ) highly lipophilic , partition lipid bilayers , thus protect hydrolysis aqueous milieu bloodstream , ( 2 ) 10-hydroxy functionality drug effectively ablate high affinity interaction carboxylate drug form albumin , previously show diminish level active lactone specie circulation . On basis stability activity , AR-67 ( formerly DB-67 ) select National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) development first cycle Rapid Access Intervention Development ( RAID ) program . Data cycle I , well independent data collaborative effort , reveal impressive vitro vivo antitumor activity , particularly intracranial glioma model system . Through continued support RAID program , drug extensively studied mouse , rat beagle dog pre-clinical MTD determine . After extensive investigation various formulation , Cremophor : ethanol compound identify appropriate phase I study human GMP grade drug product refine complete . This protocol describe initial phase I study human use AR-67 ( formerly DB-67 ) . Primary Endpoint : - To estimate MTD describe DLT intravenous AR-67 ( formerly DB-67 ) administer daily 5 day every 21 day adults recurrent refractory solid tumor standard therapy effective . Secondary Endpoints : - To characterize plasma pharmacokinetics AR-67 ( formerly DB-67 ) metabolites intravenous administration . - To explore pharmacogenetic effect polymorphisms drug metabolism transport mediate liver enzymes efflux uptake protein , respectively , relate polymorphism AR-67 ( formerly DB-67 ) pharmacokinetics toxicity .</detailed_description>
