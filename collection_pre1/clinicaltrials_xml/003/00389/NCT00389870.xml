	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , irinotecan , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Cyclosporine may help irinotecan work well make tumor cell sensitive drug . Monoclonal antibody , panitumumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Panitumumab may also stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether irinotecan effective give without panitumumab cyclosporine treat colorectal cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase III trial study irinotecan compare well work give without panitumumab cyclosporine treat patient advanced metastatic colorectal cancer respond fluorouracil .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Irinotecan With Without Panitumumab Cyclosporine Treating Patients With Advanced Metastatic Colorectal Cancer That Did Not Respond Fluorouracil</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare efficacy toxicity single-agent irinotecan hydrochloride ( Ir ) v Ir cyclosporine ( IrC ) patient fluorouracil-resistant advanced colorectal cancer . - Compare efficacy single-agent Ir v Ir panitumumab ( IrP ) patient . Secondary - Correlate toxicity Ir and/or IrC genetic variability enzyme involve irinotecan hydrochloride 's disposition pathway . - Compare IrC Ir metabolite ( SN38 ; SN38G ) , term pharmacokinetic profile . - Correlate benefit IrP tumor expression epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) know down-stream molecule predictive measure . - Correlate IrP efficacy toxicity ( specifically severity skin rash ) somatic alteration EGFR gene and/or germline variability relate gene . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label , control , multicenter study . Patients stratify accord prior cetuximab ( yes v ) . Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV 30-90 minute day 1 . - Arm II : Patients receive irinotecan hydrochloride IV 15-40 minute day 1 oral cyclosporine three time day day 1-3 . - Arm III : Patients receive panitumumab IV 30-90 minute follow irinotecan hydrochloride IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Single-agent panitumumab may continue break chemotherapy treatment . In arm , treatment repeat every 3 week 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients respond stable disease may continue treatment absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Quality life assess baseline 12 24 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 12 week 1 year . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 1,269 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
