	<brief_summary>Small bowel obstruction responsible 2 5 % emergency hospital admission 20 % emergency surgical procedure . In 60 80 % case , acute small bowel obstruction consequence intraperitoneal postoperative adhesion . They constitute extremely frequent pathology , lead high rate hospital admission money expense . Management small bowel obstruction base 2 option : either surgical approach patient operate , conservative treatment surgery propose case failure medical treatment . The surgical approach lead operate excessive rate patient medical approach increase risk increase small bowel resection , morbidity rate hospitalization duration . In order improve management small bowel obstruction , seem necessary well distinguish patient need emergency surgical procedure patient medical treatment useful . Many study perform investigate value image management small bowel obstruction , use abdominal X-ray , oral gastrografin administration CT-Scan . The aim study analyse effect systematic performance image investigation management patient present postoperative small bowel obstruction . All patient suffer postoperative small bowel obstruction include study . They randomise 2 group . In group S , patient CT-Scan oral water administration group SG , Patients CT-Scan oral gastrografin administration The major end point study analyse whether image examination reduce need surgical approach rate small bowel resection determine influence fast time hospitalization duration</brief_summary>
