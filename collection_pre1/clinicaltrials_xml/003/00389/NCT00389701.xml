	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Bortezomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , dexamethasone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving bortezomib together dexamethasone may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give bortezomib together dexamethasone work treat patient multiple myeloma relapse responded treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib Dexamethasone Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma That Has Relapsed Has Not Responded Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine overall response rate ( complete response partial response ) patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma treat induction therapy maintenance therapy comprise bortezomib dexamethasone . Secondary - Determine toxicity regimen patient - Determine tolerability regimen patient . - Determine duration response patient treat regimen . - Determine time progression patient treat regimen . - Determine overall progression-free survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This open-label study . - Induction therapy : Patients receive bortezomib IV day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 . Patients also receive oral dexamethasone day 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) receive additional 2 course induction therapy proceed maintenance therapy . - Maintenance therapy : Patients receive bortezomib IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Patients also receive oral dexamethasone day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 , 22 , 23 . Treatment repeat every 36 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve CR receive additional 2 course maintenance therapy beyond documentation CR . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
