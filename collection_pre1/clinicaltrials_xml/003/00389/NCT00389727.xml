	<brief_title>Simultaneous Integrated Boost ( SIB ) - IMRT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Loco-regional failure remain major concern follow irradiation locally advanced head neck cancer . This led radiation oncologist investigate novel approach offer well therapeutic index . Modification dose fractionation schedule improve therapeutic outcome use accelerate hyperfractionated regime [ Ang , 1990 ; Ang , 1998 ; Fu , 2000 ; Gwozdz , 1997 ] . Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy ( IMRT ) technique allow plan irradiation different target different dose level single treatment session , instead successive treatment plan . With conventional 2D radiotherapy , normal tissue tumor irradiate similar dose per fraction 1.8-2 Gy , whereas IMRT dose gradient introduce manner normal tissue receive much low dose per fraction . Isoeffective relationship base Linear-Quadratic ( LQ ) model show similar total physical ( nominal ) dose , lower dose per fraction 2 Gy reduce biological effect , increase dose per fraction 2 Gy increase effect [ Withers , 1988 ] . As highly conformal dose distribution achievable IMRT make possible envisage increase physical dose still maintain dose OAR reasonable level , several option could consider attain objective . In simultaneous accelerated radiation therapy ( SMART ) boost technique initially describe Butler , large fraction 2.4 Gy deliver primary Planning Target Volume ( PTV ) associate primary tumor GTV , conventional fraction 2 Gy deliver secondary PTV associate region risk microscopic disease total dose 60 Gy 50 Gy , respectively [ Butler , 1999 ] . The treatment thus complete 5 week , correspond moderate shortening treatment time . The term `` simultaneous integrate boost '' ( SIB ) introduce later define treatment , deliver different dos per fraction different target region [ Mohan , 2000 ] . The author propose either delivery conventional 2 Gy per fraction primary PTV , allow significantly low dose per fraction secondary PTV , delivery 2 Gy per fraction lower intermediate dose volume , thereby enable high dose per fraction deliver primary PTV , much 2.4 Gy gross disease . The latter regimen advantage shorten treatment duration , increase biological dose . The SIB technique offer biological advantage shorten treatment duration , i.e . 70 Gy 6 week , show significantly increase loco-regional control compare dose deliver 7 week [ Fu , 2000 ] . With prescription dose per fraction 2.4 Gy primary PTV , physical dose increase 72 Gy , correspond biologically equivalent dose 79.3 Gy ( include correction overall treatment time [ OTT ] ) . Assuming 37 value 2 , increase biological dose 7.5 % could translate increase loco-regional control order 15 % [ Bentzen , 2002 ] . The gain result increase equivalent dose could achieve without increase late normal tissue complication compare standard treatment ( 70 Gy 2 Gy per fraction ) . Only normal tissue embed tumor volume thus include PTV would irradiate dose per fraction similar tumor . Provided dose per fraction OAR limit maximum 2 Gy per fraction , increase dose intensity would achievable without undue damage normal tissue . However , concept increase dose intensity SIB technique validate well-designed phase I /II thereafter phase III trial . In line , Radiation Therapy Oncology Group initiate IMRT phase I/II trial ( RTOG H-0022 ) oropharyngeal carcinoma . In protocol , dose 66 Gy prescribe primary tumor PTV deliver 30 fraction 2.2 Gy 6 week ; simultaneously , physical dose 54 Gy ( 30 fraction 1.8 Gy ) prescribe PTV associate subclinical disease . The main objective protocol assess adequacy target coverage salivary gland sparing , determine rate pattern loco-regional recurrence , assess nature prevalence acute late normal tissue toxicity relationship dose distribution . This feasibility study carry assess clinically SIB approach moderately advanced carcinoma .</detailed_description>
