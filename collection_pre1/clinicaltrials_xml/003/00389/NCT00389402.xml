	<brief_title>BASIC : Boosted Atazanavir Saquinavir Induced Lipid Changes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main objective study measure change blood lipid 48 week treatment saquinavir ( SQV ) / ritonavir ( RTV ) atazanavir ( ATV ) / RTV , combination tenofovir ( TDF ) / emtricitabine ( FTC ) . All medication commonly use treatment HIV-1 infection . When initial anti-HIV therapy select , several important issue consider effectiveness , possible long- and/or short-term side effect , frequency medication intake amount pill need take . There currently concern long-term metabolic side effect exist treatment regimen . Metabolic disorder , elevate blood lipid ( include cholesterol ) decrease sensitivity insulin , increase chance diabetes , pose increase risk cardiovascular disease . A large cohort study ( D : A : D study ) , execute worldwide , include Dutch hospital , actually show use HIV combination therapy coincides increase risk develop cardiovascular disease . A certain category HIV inhibitor , protease inhibitor , particularly associate elevate blood lipid . Results afore-mentioned worldwide study recently indicate particular use protease inhibitor increase risk cardiovascular disease , important extent explain change blood lipid cause medication . There however protease inhibitor , recently develop drug atazanavir ( ATV ) protease inhibitor saquinavir ( SQV ) already available several year , show little effect blood lipid . SQV disadvantage dose twice-daily , many capsule ( 10-12 total per day ) . Now new SQV tablet develop , number capsule take per day decrease dramatically ( 4 total per day ) moreover become possible actual practice take capsule per day . It advisable , SQV ATV , combine medication one capsule ritonavir ( RTV ) , another protease inhibitor . This ensure reliable effective level SQV ATV reach blood . RTV associate elevated blood lipid , effect limit low dosage use combination ATV SQV . And SQV ATV combine equal amount RTV , expect favorable effect blood lipid . For reason , risk cardiovascular disease expect equally limited use either two regimen . In addition long-term effect blood lipid , pose risk cardiovascular disease , disturb fat distribution ( lipodystrophy ) another frequently occur complication treatment HIV-1 infection . This disturbed fat distribution associate subcutaneous fat loss body part ( particularly face , arm legs , buttock ) fat accumulation body part ( abdomen , back neck female breast ) . Subcutaneous fat loss mainly associate thymidine-containing nucleoside analogue like zidovudine ( AZT ) stavudine ( d4T ) . Previous study patient receive antiretroviral treatment first time show combination TDF / lamivudine ( 3TC ) ( latter drug closely resemble FTC ) lead loss subcutaneous fat ( lipoatrophy ) , oppose combination d4T / 3TC AZT / 3TC . The cause fat accumulation however less clear , often coincide change blood lipid . The chance occurrence fat accumulation could thus depend extent HIV combination therapy coincide elevation blood lipid . As become clear initial therapy involve less risk long-term side effect , important develop therapy schedule safe regard aspect . According describe , combination either ATV / RTV SQV / RTV , administer together TDF FTC prevent fat loss , would good initial regimen , combination little effect blood lipid may therefore decrease chance fat accumulation . A big advantage use combination therapy protease inhibitor combination low dose RTV largely diminish chance development resistance HIV protease inhibitor , even virus becomes detectable blood initial suppression - oppose commonly use alternative initial therapy non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor use instead protease inhibitor . With use drug , risk resistance much great . It therefore essential good examine protease-inhibitor-containing regimen , expect advantage produce minimal effect lipid sugar metabolism well limited chance resistance development . In BASIC study want show SQV / RTV comparable ATV / RTV regard effect blood lipid . We also look detail effect fat loss fat accumulation , well sugar metabolism insulin sensitivity , hope limit change area demonstrate . One study patient give first antiretroviral treatment demonstrate slight decrease bone density ( form bone loss ) first year treatment TDF FTC ( closely resemble 3TC ) . This however cause clinical problem . It reassure see complete recovery bone density see first year . Nevertheless want collect data possible effect bone metabolism reason perform two bone density assessment study . Finally , indication renal function patient treat TDF may become slightly disturbed . It yet clear method accurately estimate detect slight change renal function . For reason , plan compare number different method estimate renal function part study . For purpose number additional relevant measurement obtain use blood sample already collect part study anyway . The main purpose study measure change blood lipid compare patient start either SQV / RTV-containing regimen ATV / RTV-containing regimen . In addition , change fat distribution , sugar metabolism insulin sensitivity compare group . Possible change bone density renal function also examine . Furthermore , virologic effectiveness overall safety two treatment evaluate compare .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Providing write informed consent HIV1 infect patient . At least 18 year age . Males nonpregnant , nonlactating female . Women childbearing age must negative urine pregnancy test screening . All female participant must encourage utilise adequate contraception month precede entry duration study . Antiretroviral treatment naive . Indication antiretroviral therapy accord current treatment guideline . CD4 count &gt; 350 cells/mm3 , except case symptomatic HIV disease and/or AIDSdefining illness . HIV2 co infection . Use comedication know pharmacological interaction precludes appropriate use one study drug . Anticipated noncompliance protocol . Presence newly ( within 30 day prior time enrolment ) diagnose HIVrelated opportunistic infection condition may interfere ability comply study . Chronic active viral hepatitis chronic liver disease , opinion investigator contraindication use study drug . Patients may consider active HBV replication ( HBVsurface antigen positive and/or HBVDNA positive ) may exclude case investigator feel benefit start tenofovir/emtricitabine outweigh risk `` hepatitis flare '' case tenofovir/emtricitabine would need prematurely discontinue reason trial . Chronic hepatitis C allow , provide treatment hepatitis C anticipate study period . Women pregnant , intention become pregnant study period . Clinically relevant laboratory abnormality : anaemia , thrombocytopenia , leucopenia , elevate liver transaminase , elevate bilirubin , elevate amylase , elevate lipase , opinion investigator contraindication use study drug , current know clinical laboratory parameter ACTG Grade 4 ( see Appendix 2 ) . However , asymptomatic Grade 4 abnormality permit discretion investigator deem clinically appropriate . Abnormalities deem insignificant investigator must discuss sponsor prior enrolment . Significant renal dysfunction ( creatinine clearance [ CrCl ] &lt; 60 mL/min ) and/or hepatic impairment ( aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase [ AST/ALT ] &gt; 3 X ULN and/or document liver cirrhosis ) Note : The site calculate patient 's CrCl use CockcroftGault formula show : CrCl = [ 140 age ( yr ) ] × weight ( kg ) × constant 72 × serum creatinine ( Cr ) ( mg/dL ) , constant = 1 men 0.85 woman . Use nephrotoxic agent opinion investigator contraindication use tenofovir disoproxil fumarate study drug . Patients receive within 4 week prior entry , anticipate need treatment radiation therapy cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agent protocol study period . Patients take investigational drug 30 day prior start study .</criteria>
