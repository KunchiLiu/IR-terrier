	<brief_title>Mechanical Retrieval Recanalization Stroke Clots Using Embolectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke commonly occur blockage blood flow one arteries brain . The blockage often cause clot . There currently one FDA-approved stroke treatment . However , 2 percent ischemic stroke patient receive treatment must give within 4.5 hour stroke onset . There overwhelm need new treatment extend time window treatment since individual stroke arrive hospital 4.5-hour time window . Two promise new device Merci Retriever , tiny corkscrew device , Penumbra System , aspiration device . Both design remove clot artery thereby restore blood flow brain . The primary purpose study compare effectiveness treatment Merci Retriever Penumbra System within 8 hour symptom onset standard medical treatment , identify people might benefit device appearance stroke multimodal computerized tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Previous test determine use Merci Retriever successful opening block blood vessel approximately ½ individual use , Penumbra System successful opening block blood vessel approximately 80 % individual use . A total 120 participant approximately 30 different medical center enrol study . Participants randomize either receive treatment mechanical embolectomy Merci Retriever Penumbra System standard medical care treatment standard medical care alone . Standard care stroke patient may include intravenous fluid , careful regulation blood pressure , blood-thinning medicine ( heparin warfarin ) , anti-platelet medicine ( aspirin clopidogrel ) , rehabilitation therapy . Participants undergo Merci Retriever Penumbra System procedure cerebral arteriogram picture take dye prior procedure determine location blockage , follow procedure determine blood supply restore . The total mechanical embolectomy procedure either device take approximately 1 2 hour . Participants brief neurological exam several time time monitor change neurological condition . Participants follow-up visit , include neurological exam , 30 day 90 day . This study part Specialized Program Translational Research Acute Stroke ( SPOTRIAS ) , allow researcher enhance initiate translational research ultimately benefit stroke patient treat patient le 2 hour , find way treat additional patient later .</detailed_description>
