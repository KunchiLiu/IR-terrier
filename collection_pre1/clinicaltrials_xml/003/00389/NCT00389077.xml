	<brief_summary>This study drug perifosine patient standard treatment option . This study design identify cancer type respond perifosine , determine regimen perifosine effective one . Patients either solid tumor lymphomas protocol represent reasonable optimal treatment randomize receive either perifosine 100 mg daily 900 mg weekly disease progression . Based currently available data anticipate dos easily tolerate patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Two Schedules Perifosine Patients With Solid Tumors Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This exploratory phase IIA trial unique element design patient selection aim : - Identify responsive tumor type predict preclinical Phase I study , - Determine tumor likely stabilize shrink , - Identify dose almost toxicity . - To determine whether response ( stabilization ) observe either daily weekly schedule , . Since efficacy goal study look evidence activity perifosine , daily weekly arm combine assess response . - Response therapy base either tumor regression ( objective response , partial complete ) OR stabilization disease . It anticipate study provide `` proof principle '' regard use perifosine serve pivotal trial regulatory purpose . Information obtain study use design additional trial definitive nature .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis either lymphoma solid tumor establish therapy , opinion treat physician , prolong patient 's survival large net effect patient 's quality life . The physician must believe patient 's course growth rate tumor patient would feel comfortable continue treatment least 12 week even transient period modest tumor growth ( define less 30 % ) first week follow initiation perifosine treatment . Patients must life expectancy 6 month . Patients must eligible available perifosine study . In general , patient receive two prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens metastatic disease . Patients may measurable nonmeasurable disease . If outcome patient base response use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion , patient must least one measurable lesion accurately measure least one dimension fit one follow criterion : long diameter &gt; = 20 mm use conventional technique &gt; = 10 mm spiral compute tomography ( CT ) scan . The dimension target lesion use determine objective response along date last measurement method measurement ( e.g . physical examination , spiral CT , conventional CT ) must record enrollment form prior patient 's first treatment . If outcome patient base increase time progression , follow apply : The time progression systemic treatment administer prior enrollment trial must carefully document 12 week . There must baseline tumor evaluation sit likely metastasis , base sign symptom , evaluate begin preprotocol baseline time interval . ( A total body CT scan magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] usually suffice required meet criterion ) . During 12+ week patient progressionfree , must symptoms sign new metastasis warrant evaluation , undertaken . Progression prior metastasis appearance new metastasis must document end progressionfree 12+ week period . This prior progressionfree interval must record enrollment case report form prior patient 's first treatment . Patients performance status 0 1 accord ECOG criterion . Patients must adequate organ marrow function . Adequate organ marrow function describe . hematocrit ( HCT ) &gt; = 28 % ( without growth factor support ) creatinine &lt; = 2.5 mg/dl total bilirubin &lt; = 1.5x upper limit normal transaminase &lt; = 2.5x upper limit normal Patients must recover acute toxicity relate prior therapy include surgery radiotherapy , exclude alopecia . Patients breast cancer prostate cancer discontinue endocrine therapy prior entry study must wait minimum 1 month reassess withdrawal response prior start perifosine . However , requirement endocrine therapy discontinue . Patients must able ingest oral medication obtain gastrostomy tube . Patients must least 18 year age Patients must ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Rapidly progress disease , define progression within 12 week initiation previous regimen Patients receive investigational agent device Patients recently ( within 8 week ) begin new cancer treatment ( e.g. , bisphosphonates ) continue concomitantly perifosine History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition perifosine ( miltefosine edelfosine ) Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction perifosine . Patients history unstable newly diagnose angina pectoris , recent myocardial infarction ( within 6 month enrollment ) , New York Heart Association class IIIV congestive heart failure Female patient pregnant lactate ineligible .</criteria>
