	<detailed_description>Hip fracture major public health problem strike consequence old adult , family , health care system . By year 2040 , 650,00 hip fracture occur annually old adult age 65 . Many survive hip fracture decrease functional performance unable live independently community . Moreover , great loss bone density muscle strength occur first two month post hip fracture . Recovery follow hip fracture show greatly facilitated participation rehabilitation program , continue participation regular exercise program increase functional recovery , muscle strength , prevent future fracture . Despite benefit exercise , difficult initiate exercise activity old adult , help adhere exercise regime even challenge . Self-efficacy , belief individual 's capability perform course action attain desire outcome , outcome expectancy , belief carry behavior lead desire outcome , hypothesized critical factor adhere regular exercise program . A total 240 subject ( 60 per group ) five area hospital meet eligibility criterion recruit study . A study nurse periodically contact designate liaison hospital obtain names patient hip fracture . Following identification , study nurse contact patient enroll study . An experimental 2 X 2 factorial design repeat measure use test impact self-efficacy base intervention exercise behavior , activity , efficacy beliefs barrier , performance , health status , mood , fall , fear fall , fall-related injury older adult sustain hip fracture . Participants randomize consent obtain baseline evaluation complete . Participants randomly assign one four group define 2 X 2 design : ( 1 ) Exercise Only component ( 2 ) Plus ( motivation ) component ; ( 3 ) Exercise Plus ( exercise + motivation ) component , ( 4 ) routine care .</detailed_description>
