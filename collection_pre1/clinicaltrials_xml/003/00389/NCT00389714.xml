	<detailed_description>Composite resin presently among popular esthetic restorative material dentistry . These material offer excellent esthetic appearance , allow conservative cavity preparation become widely accept clinical use primary molar 1-23 . Despite improvement property , achieve well material incremental place technique , composite resin restoration appear still several drawback : although similar amalgam short term study , high long term failure rate , mainly due discoloration , loss retention secondary caries3,11,19 , time-consuming technique sensitive , lack anti-cariogenic potential amenable secondary caries cervical dentin margin 1 , 2 . Continued interest provide advance restorative esthetic material lead development new generation composite . Among new material develop use minute amount nanoparticles convert composite possess permanent antibacterial property . It great interest observe clinical behavior new material utilized clinical practice . Thus aims present in-vivo study : 1 . To evaluate clinical radiographic performance New Restorative System place adhesive system class II restoration primary molar . 2 . To assess , SEM , micromorphology cervical , buccal lingual margin proximal surface restore teeth retrieve exfoliation extraction . 3 . To ass , mean polarized light microscopy , integrity cervical margin retrieve teeth . STUDY DESIGN The study perform Post Graduate Clinic Pediatric Dentistry Department Hadassah School Dental Medicine Jerusalem . The project approve Human Ethical Committee ( Helsinki ) , Hadassah Hospital Israeli Ministry Health . The study double blind , randomize , two-cell , split mouth , design . The following clinical treating procedure test : 1 . Fissure sealant permanent teeth 2 . Class II restoration primary molar . A . SUBJECT SELECTION To eligible participate study child 5 10 year old , present least two primary molar small moderate proximal carious lesion . These proximal contact adjacent tooth antagonist . The child available recall appointment every six month exfoliation teeth , parental consent participate study . Following medical history clinical examination , bilateral bite-wing radiograph take , diagnosis caries need restore assessment patient 's caries risk 24 . The teeth suitable study randomly assign restored one two group : 1 . - restore commercial composite - hereafter control group 2 . - restore commercial composite supplement B . CLINICAL PROCEDURE After local anesthesia , teeth isolated rubber dam , tooth preparation make use # 330 carbide bur water coolant spray , cervical margin place enamel . Cavity design limit caries removal without occlusal lock , groove place occlusal buccal palatal surface . Line point angle round ( Fig . 1 ) . Fig 1 : demonstrates first second maxillary primary molar preparation insertion restorative material . . Restorative step 1 . Placement T-band metal matrix insert wedge firmly , burnish matrix band establish proximal contour contact area ; 2 . Acid etch enamel dentin 15 second rinse ; 3 . Removal excess water leave surface moist ; 4 . Appling two layer Single Bond adhesive enamel dentin use brush saturate adhesive , gently dry 2-5 second ; 5 . Light cure 10 second ; 6 . Applying Restorative System incrementally . 7 . Curing increment 40 second ; 8 . Removal band cure another 20 second buccal lingual cervical area . h. Finishing polish restoration use 3M™ ESPE™ Sof-Lex™ Finishing polish System . 1 . Placement T-band metal matrix insert wedge firmly , burnish matrix band establish proximal contour contact area ; 2 . Applying Adper Prompt L-Pop entire surface cavity rub 15 second . 3 . Blow dry , light cure 10 second . 4 . Applying Filtek™ Supreme Universal Restorative System incrementally . 5 . Curing increment 40 second ; 6 . Removal band cure another 20 second buccal lingual cervical area . 7 . Finishing polish restoration use 3M™ ESPE™ Sof-Lex™ Finishing polish System . C. EVALUATION CLINICAL The restoration evaluate baseline- immediately completion , six month yearly thereafter least three year , tooth exfoliation patient drop . The following parameter examine : surface appearance , color match , marginal adaptation , marginal discoloration , anatomic form secondary caries , use criterion describe Cvar Ryge ( 1971 ) 25 -see attach evaluation sheet . 30 restoration group randomly select photographed digital camera baseline follow examination . The stored photograph assess use parameter clinical evaluation . CONTACT AREA As part clinical evaluation , quality contact area assess waxed dental floss classify follows3 : A . Excellent : resistance meet pass dental floss ; B . Fair : contact present , dental floss pass without resistance ; C. Poor : No contact exist adjacent tooth . RADIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION Bitewing radiograph take one-year recall interval , examine presence radiolucent defect cervical margin , bubble body restoration . POST EXFOLIATION EXAMINATION The patient encourage bring teeth dental clinic exfoliation , promise financial reward ( 10.00 ₪-ten Israeli shekel = US $ .2.00 approximately ) . They instruct keep exfoliate tooth tap water , small plastic vial provide recall examination close shed time . The proximal margin retrieve teeth evaluate defect discoloration use dental explorer . SEM EVALUATION OF THE MARGINS The retrieved teeth keep humid environment time section . Impressions ( Aquasil-Dentsply DeTrey GmbH ) take , epoxy replica ( Epokwick resin , Lake Bluff , IL 60044 ) proximal surface prepare gold plat . The micromorphology margin evaluate SEM ( Jeol JSM 35 ) , defect tooth-restoration interface assess cervical proximal margin ( buccal lingual ) . These defect classify accord fraction margin length show gap wider 10 micron , describe Fuks &amp; others 26 : 1 . No gaps present tooth restoration margin ; 2 . Gaps present less 1/3 margin ; 3 . Gaps present less 2/3 margin ; 4 . Gaps present along entire margin . POLARIZED LIGHT MICROSCOPY The teeth embed acrylic resin section follow mesiodistal axis tooth , use Vari/Cut VC-50 section machine ( Leco Corp , St. Joseph , MO 49085-2396 ) . One two section restoration sand become thin enough polarize light examination . The specimen examine water imbibition medium use polarized light stereomicroscope X20 magnification . Wall lesion demineralization area adjacent gingival margin restoration measure enamel distance 100 micron , standard distance recurrent caries studies27 . D. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS The restoration , contact area , radiograph , SEM polarize microscopy evaluate least two evaluator . In case disagreement , teeth reevaluate case discuss reach consensus . The result obtain analyzed statistical difference group . Table I : Experimental Design : Distribution restore teeth . Group Number teeth Type restoration 1 . 60 Filtek Supreme + Single Bond Adhesive System 2 . 60 Filtek Supreme + Adper Prompt L- Pop</detailed_description>
