	<detailed_description>Objectives Investigation The purpose investigation establish safety effectiveness LDR Spine Mobi-C® Cervical Disc Prosthesis anterior cervical interbody mechanical device . The primary objective study evaluate overall success rate investigational device compare control treatment patient symptomatic DDD radiculopathy myeloradiculopathy one two adjacent level . Patients without prior cervical fusion C3 C7 unresponsive non-operative conservative treatment six week symptom onset presence progressive symptom sign nerve/spinal cord compression despite continued non-operative conservative treatment . Study Design Rationale The study prospective , randomize , multi-center , concurrently control investigation , study device compare control treatment consist conventional anterior cervical discectomy fusion ( ACDF ) accordance Smith-Robinson procedure . Patients follow two year postsurgery ( primary endpoint ) 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 year thereafter . Duration Investigation Patients follow post-operatively 6 week , 3- , 6- , 12- , 18- , 24-months . After 24 month , patient continue follow 3,4 , 5 7 year . Design Techniques Avoid Bias To eliminate selection bias , investigational control comparison group assign random . Institutional Review Board No clinical study begin without document approval clinical investigation Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) affiliate study center .</detailed_description>
