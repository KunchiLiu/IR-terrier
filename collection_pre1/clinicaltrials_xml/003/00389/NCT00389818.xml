	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Others interfere ability cancer cell grow spread . Giving combination chemotherapy together rituximab may kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give combination chemotherapy together rituximab work treat patient newly diagnose AIDS-related B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Rituximab Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed AIDS-Related B-Cell Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine complete response rate ( complete response complete response unconfirmed ) patient newly diagnose , AIDS-related B-cell non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma treat doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome , rituximab , cyclophosphamide , vincristine , prednisone ( DR-COP ) . - Determine duration response ( relapse-free survival ) patient treat regimen . - Determine median survival time patient treated regimen . - Determine rate bacterial , fungal , opportunistic infection patient treat regimen . Secondary - Determine , preliminarily , relationship MDR-1 expression tumor tissue response therapy patient treat regimen . - Determine , preliminarily , relationship response survival BCL-2 expression tumor tissue patient treat regimen . - Determine relationship development bacterial , fungal , and/or opportunistic infection baseline CD4 lymphocyte count , HIV-1 RNA level , quantitative immunoglobulin level , change quantitative immunoglobulin level time patient treated regimen . - Compare result positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan traditional CT scan predict response therapy patient . - Examine relationship chemotherapeutic drug level receipt specific antiretroviral and/or anti-infective medication patient . - Examine mortality cause death patient treat regimen . - Determine event-free survival 1 year . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , multicenter study . Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome IV 90 minute , rituximab IV 5-7 hour , cyclophosphamide IV 1 hour , vincristine IV 1-2 minute day 1 oral prednisone day 1-5 . Patients also receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) , sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) , pegfilgrastim begin day 3 continue blood count recover . Treatment repeat every 21-28 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo laboratory/biomarker study baseline every 2 course chemotherapy . Tissue examine immunohistochemistry BCL-2 , Ki67 , MDR-1 , along marker . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 44 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
