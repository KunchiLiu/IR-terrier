	<detailed_description>The mechanism acetaminophen cause analgesia antipyretic effect entirely clear . Recently new COX isoenzyme identify termed COX 3 . In human isoenzyme abundant cerebral cortex heart . Inhibition COX-3 could represent primary central mechanism acetaminophen decrease pain possibly fever ( 10 ) . An effect acetaminophen presynaptic 5-HT ( 2 ) receptor hypocampus demonstrate ( 11 ) suggest primary effect acetaminophen CNS . Many study ( 12-16 ) describe pharmacokinetics oral rectal acetaminophen infant neonate . Yet , data acetaminophen concentration CSF limit . Two study adult ( 17 ; 18 ) use intravenous propacetamol describe concentration acetaminophen plasma CSF . Acetaminophen detect early 15 minute administration reach peak concentration CSF 4th hour . A small study ( 19 ) nine child indwell ventricular drain find cerebrospinal fluid concentration lag behind plasma equilibration half time 0.72 h. This study describe CSF concentration neonate use dose 40mg/kg , high recommend dose child . To best knowledge data acetaminophen CSF concentration neonate . The objective current study describe concentration acetaminophen CSF infant single administration acetaminophen . A good understanding pharmacokinetics acetaminophen penetration CSF enable u good predict effect commonly use drug .</detailed_description>
