	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether 10-day course therapy orally administer VCH-759 give 400-mg , 600-mg 800-mg three time daily effectively reduce amount circulate virus ( i.e. , viral load ) patient early-stage chronic hepatitis C-infection . This study also evaluate safety tolerability treatment VCH-759 . Blood sample also take measure level VCH-759 present plasma various time point treatment period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Proof-of-concept Study VCH-759 Treatment Hepatitis C-infection .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective trial assess antiviral activity , safety , tolerability VCH-759 monotherapy adult subject early-stage chronic HCV-infection . In addition , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile VCH-759 steady state HCV-infected adult relationship VCH-759 plasma level correspond HCV RNA reduction administer dosage VCH-759 adult also investigate . The kinetics plasma HCV RNA treatment ten ( 10 ) day VCH-759 follow discontinuation therapy also study . This randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled study subject assign receive treatment one follow oral dosage VCH-759 : 400 mg t.i.d. , 600 mg t.i.d. , 800 mg t.i.d. , placebo ; enrollment three cohort occur sequentially . Within cohort , subject randomize treatment : placebo ratio 3:1 total 12 subject per cohort ; subject randomize block 4 . The decision continue dose within cohort determine independent review safety data include Day 11 first 4 subject within dose cohort ; review conduct qualified medical specialist , conjunction sponsor medical monitor . The decision proceed next cohort decide independent review Day 11 safety data 12 subject previous cohort . Eligible subject receive study medication three time daily 10 day return study center follow-up assessment Day 11 , Day 17 , Day 24 .</detailed_description>
