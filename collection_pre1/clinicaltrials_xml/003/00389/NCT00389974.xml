	<brief_title>Sunitinib Malate Treating Patients With Uterine Cervical Cancer That Stage IVB , Recurrent , Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess efficacy ( objective response rate ) sunitinib ( sunitinib malate ) give orally daily 4 every 6 week patient unresectable , locally advanced metastatic carcinoma cervix . II . To assess toxicity sunitinib patient unresectable , locally advanced metastatic carcinoma cervix . III . To document time progression , early objective progression rate , , objective response observe , response duration . OUTLINE : Patients receive sunitinib malate orally ( PO ) daily 4 week . Treatment repeat every 6 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) may receive 2 course CR PR reach . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
