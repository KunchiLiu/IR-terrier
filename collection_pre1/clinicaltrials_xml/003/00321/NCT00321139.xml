	<brief_summary>Blockages blood vessel heart main cause chest pain , heart attack , sudden death . A cardiac catheterization , inject x-ray dye blood vessel heart take picture , currently best way assess blockage . This procedure , however , allow u know happen inside blockage . Some blockage high risk `` rupture '' completely block blood vessel others low risk . Blood level different substance produce body show associate high risk chest pain , heart attack , sudden death . There also evidence study animal tissue take human surgery substance make blockage . We would like investigate whether number substance make blockage release bloodstream . We take one tablespoon sample blood upstream downstream blockage blood vessel heart . The sample obtain use thin catheter , plastic tubing , 1/3 size blood vessel heart . We take sample tightest blockage find well another , less tight , blockage compare two . We also sample blood tightest blockage open angioplasty . Finally , also take picture blockage study use small ultrasound camera insert blood vessel . We compare level substance measure feature see picture . We hope learn substance measure identify blockage risk rupture cause heart attack sudden death . All patient enter study already angioplasty do . The procedure need study ( sample blood take picture ultrasound ) already often , though always , use patient undergo angioplasty .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction Hypothesis Coronary heart disease lead cause death United States , account &gt; 500,000 life year . Atherosclerosis underlie mechanism unstable angina , myocardial infarction , sudden cardiac death . Luminal narrowing artery cause atherosclerotic plaque encroachment cause chronic ischemic manifestation coronary heart disease , whereas superimposition thrombus plaque lead acute coronary syndrome . To date , angiography method choice detect arterial lesion . However , diagnostic technique , approximately compare degree luminal stenosis artery relative ' segment , provide insight disease state within artery , often fail detect lesion prone thrombosis , often refer 'vulnerable plaque ' . Multiple invasive non-invasive method employ order identify vulnerable plaque , usually try image plaque morphology , however none gain widespread use . Elevation several biochemical marker bloodstream associate adverse cardiovascular event . Inflammation identify significant component unstable atherosclerotic plaque . The inflammatory response seem participate early development atherosclerosis involve multiple pathways3 . Indeed , many marker inflammation show predict cardiovascular risk4-7 recent study show key inflammatory marker synthesize within atherosclerotic lesions8-10 . Another process appear precede inflammation oxidative stress . Increased cellular oxidative stress may process initiate much subsequent inflammation ultimately development atherosclerotic process . Our preliminary data demonstrates oxidative stress increase patient acute coronary syndrome coronary stenting . The immune system also activate unstable atherosclerotic plaque well document change T cells11-12 . An exciting new field medicine application system approach . One system approach metabolomics . Metabolomics base use NMR ( spectroscopic method ) multivariate statistic data analysis interpretation . NMR spectroscopy base behavior atom place static external magnetic field . 1H-NMR spectroscopy allow simultaneous detection quantification thousand low-molecular-weight metabolite within biologic fluid , result generation endogenous profile may alter disease provide characteristic `` fingerprint '' disease process . It use clinically detection ovarian cancer coronary artery disease13 , 14 . With mind , difference level oxidation inflammatory marker , activate leucocyte , metabolomic profile across atherosclerotic lesion , translesional gradient , may clinical utility . An elevated translesional gradient inflammatory oxidative marker , leucocyte activation , well change metabolomic profile , could use identify plaque prone rupture . By implication , ability simply reliably identify plaque would profound clinical consequence either allow placement intracoronary stent high-risk , yet flow-limiting lesion leave untreated would rupture lead acute coronary syndrome . We hypothesize : 1. translesional gradient ( ) marker oxidative stress , ( b ) inflammation , ( c ) activate leucocyte elevate across culprit lesion oppose non-culprit lesion individual ; 2. translesional gradient marker oxidation , inflammation leucocyte activation differ plaques high-risk morphologic appearance compare plaque low-risk morphologic appearance , assess intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) ; 3 . The metabolomic profile assess 1H-NMR spectroscopy differentiate culprit non-culprit lesion well plaque high-risk low-risk morphology . Objectives Aim 1 : To determine compare translesional gradient establish marker oxidative stress , inflammation , leucocyte activation across culprit lesion vs non-culprit lesion individual . Aim 2 : To compare translesion gradient marker oxidation , inflammation leucocyte activation plaque morphology assess intravascular ultrasound ( IVUS ) . Aim 3 : To determine system approach use 1H-NMR-based metabolomics use distinguish rupture culprit non-culprit lesion well plaque high-risk low-risk morphology . Endpoints 1 . A comparison marker oxidation , inflammation , leucocyte activation follow : 1 . A comparison make translesional marker gradient ( distal level - proximal level ) sample culprit lesion non-culprit lesion . 2 . A comparison make level ( distal level - proximal level ) culprit lesion angioplasty/stenting . 2 . A comparison marker oxidation , inflammation , leucocyte activation plaque morphologic index assess intravascular ultrasound . 3 . A comparison 1H-NMR metabolomic spectra culprit non-culprit lesion well plaque high-risk low-risk plaque morphology .</detailed_description>
