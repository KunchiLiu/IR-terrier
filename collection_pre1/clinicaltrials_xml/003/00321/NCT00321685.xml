	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give bevacizumab , radiation therapy , combination chemotherapy work treat patient undergo surgery locally advance nonmetastatic rectal cancer . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some find tumor cell kill carry tumor-killing substance . Others interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Bevacizumab may also stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs , capecitabine , may make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine , oxaliplatin , fluorouracil , leucovorin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving bevacizumab together radiation therapy combination chemotherapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving bevacizumab together combination chemotherapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate pathological complete response rate patient T3 T4 rectal cancer treat preoperatively capecitabine , oxaliplatin , bevacizumab , concurrent radiotherapy ( XRT ) . II . To evaluate resection rate T3 T4 rectal cancer expect versus actual type resection ( abdominoperinal resection [ APR ] vs. low anterior resection [ LAR ] vs. LAR/coloanal anastomosis ) . III . To make preliminary observation patient survival pattern recurrence treatment combination . IV . To gain additional experience regard toxicity tolerability preoperative postoperative regimen . OUTLINE : PREOPERATIVE CHEMORADIOTHERAPY : Patients undergo radiotherapy ( total dose tumor bed 5040 cGy ) daily ( QD ) 5 day week receive capecitabine 825 mg/m^2 orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) 5 day week 5.5 week . Patients also receive oxaliplatin 50 mg/m^2 intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 bevacizumab 5 mg/kg IV 30-90 minute day 1 , 15 , 29 radiotherapy . SURGERY : Approximately 6-8 week completion chemoradiotherapy , patient undergo surgical resection . Patients whose tumor completely resect metastatic disease discontinue protocol therapy . POSTOPERATIVE CHEMOTHERAPY : Approximately 4-12 week surgery , patient receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour , leucovorin calcium 400 mg/m^2 IV 2 hour , bevacizumab 5 mg/kg IV 30-90 minute day 1 . Patients also receive fluorouracil 2400 mg/m^2 IV continuously 46 hour begin day 1 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 9 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive 3 additional course leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , bevacizumab . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 10 year .</detailed_description>
