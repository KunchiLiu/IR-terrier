	<brief_summary>Roughly thirty percent people undergo open heart surgery get abnormal heart beat afterwards know atrial fibrillation ( AF ) . While life threatening , abnormal heart beat increase likelihood stroke delay recovery . There strategies prevent post-operative AF , costly sometimes undesirable side effect . Therefore , would best use preventive treatment high risk patient . We intend develop risk prediction model base demographic electrocardiogram ( ECG ) finding predict likely get AF . We develop model use data already available patient undergone cardiac surgery . The development model use late mathematical algorithm similar use study genetic evolution . This type model capable look many parameter unbiased way , strong , independent predictor remain final model . Once , model develop , validate model compare prediction actual outcomes previously record database .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1.0 Background Currently , roughly thirty percent coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) patient develop atrial fibrillation ( AF ) five day follow surgery , increase risk stroke , prolong hospital stay three four day , increase overall cost procedure [ 1 , 2 ] . According source , $ 1 billion spend annually problem US alone [ 2 ] . Current pharmacologic nonpharmacologic mean AF prevention suboptimal , side effect , expense , inconvenience limit widespread use patient [ 3 ] . Though many method present tout high predictive value term sensitivity specificity post-operative AF , none reliable enough use clinical setting . This may due lack standardized method measurement certain morphological P wave feature ECG analyse [ 4 ] . Furthermore , medical community rely limited variable combination method much long , especially advanced method data mine decision-making harness . A Bayesian network ( BN ) excellent tool make decision base collect information even able handle miss data point well [ 5 ] . By combine type data expert knowledge BN Bayesian statistical approach , good accuracy likely result . 2.0 Objectives The main objective research develop Bayesian network ( BN ) classifier model/predict/assign risk occurrence atrial fibrillation coronary artery bypass graft patient incorporation different type patient data . Expert knowledge come doctor field combine use Bayesian statistic patient data electrocardiogram ( ECG ) analysis , improve Frequentist method currently use . We intend investigate profit loss due inclusion follow data type : - Collected Data- Risk factor medical indicator record hospital - ECG Features- Time , frequency , wavelet , nonlinear domain feature derive ECG signal showing AF prediction potential - Expert Knowledge- Cardiologist modify probability distribution frequency belief input data base past experience This study analyze data patient underwent cardiac surgery Emory University Hospital , Crawford Long Hospital , Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center . The collected data include demographic , pre-operative , operative , post-operative take patient 's chart . ECG available telemetry data also collect analyzed morphological feature , may yield AF predisposition clue . Following development AF prediction algorithm , test subset data point extract database . This study feasibility study fund research . 3.0 Patient Selection 3.1 Eligibility criterion : 1 . All patient patient underwent cardiac surgery Emory University Hospital , Crawford Long Hospital , VA Medical Center . 3.2 Ineligibility criterion : 1 . Emergent operation . 2 . The presence AF Aflut time surgery . 3 . New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class IV heart failure time surgery . 4 . Hyperthyroidism 5 . Implanted device design active management atrial arrhythmia pace defibrillation 6 . Known illicit drug use 7 . Known ethanol abuse 8 . Electrophysiological ablation atrial tachycardia within 6 month operation . 4.0 Registration randomization : none 5.0 Therapy : none 6.0 Pathology : none 7.0 Patient assessment : none 8.0 Data collection : Data collect review patient 's hospital chart , telemetry recording , ECGs . The presence absence atrial fibrillation diagnose basis electrocardiographic recording confirm cardiologist . Data collect include : age , race , sex , body mass index , blood pressure , NYHA classification , Killip classification , history previous myocardial infarction , hypertension , diabetes , smoking , alcohol use , antiarrhythmic drug use , presence type pacemaker , history AF Aflut , previous cardiovascular event , type operation , length operation . Patients enrol study give unique study number identify information remove correlation telemetry chart data establish . No follow data require patient . 9.0 Statistical consideration : This study design retrospective chart review cohort patient undergoing cardiac surgery determine variable combination predict atrial fibrillation follow cardiac surgery . Within cohort , patient AF compare without atrial arrhythmias post-operative period . Probability table develop use group , thereby populate predictive Bayesian network structure . Many different structure evaluate use artificial intelligence technique ( genetic algorithm ) , evolve structure optimal form . K-fold cross-validation use validate predictive ability Bayesian network structure . Sensitivities , specificity , positive predictive value report result validation .</detailed_description>
