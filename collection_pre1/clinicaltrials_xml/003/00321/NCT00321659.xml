	<detailed_description>Fibromyalgia syndrome ( FMS ) common , chronic musculoskeletal disorder grow cause disability increase health care utilization . Current treatment focus largely pharmacological intervention , often ineffective improve symptom functional status . Recent research suggest disease self-management efficacious short-term reduce symptom severity improve function person FMS . The common form FMS self-management coping skill training ( behavioral/education ) exercise . Limited number , FMS self-management study examine short-term effect one form , use cop skill train approach . Little data exist examine long-term effect intervention , potential additive effect combine cop skill train comprehensive , group exercise program approach promote long-term compliance intervention . The objective proposal identify optimal approach FMS self-management . The study randomize , control trial compare cop skill train ( Arthritis Foundation Fibromyalgia Self-Help Course ( FSHC ) ) two exercise program - cardiovascular flexibility training without strength training - combination ( FSHC plus strength training exercise program ) . Each intervention period last 16 week include group session lead trained personnel . Subjects follow 6 month complete intervention evaluate short-term effect program . At 6 month , subject randomize two groups—one group receive 4 week refresher course original intervention every 6 month group receive intervention . Long-term follow 24 month complete 16 week intervention period . Subjects include 200 woman ( four group 50 ) , 25 65 year old confirm diagnosis FMS . Participants undergo blind assessment Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center 's GCRC five time points—baseline , completion 16-week intervention 6 , 12 24 month follow . We assess health functional status ( FIQ , SF36 ) , symptom severity ( FIQ , SF36 , Beck scale ) , self-efficacy ( Arthritis Self-Efficacy Scale ) , fitness ( muscle strength , cardiovascular fitness , flexibility ) health care utilization ( direct indirect cost ) . The study improve treatment outcome person FMS identify optimal self-management program .</detailed_description>
