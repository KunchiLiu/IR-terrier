	<brief_summary>This study evaluate ability magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use different magnet strength ( 1.5 , 3 7 Tesla ) detect damage different part brain patient multiple sclerosis . The high Tesla , great ability see brain change . Healthy subject also study compare finding patient normal volunteer . Healthy normal volunteer patient multiple sclerosis 18-65 year age may eligible study . Patients minimal clinical disability . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test . Participants undergo three MRI examination . The first 1.5 Tesla machine . The second third - 3 Tesla 7 Tesla - do within 30 day first . Each procedure take 2 hour . Before 7 Tesla examination , subject electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , blood pressure temperature measure blood sample drawn . MRI use magnetic field radio wave produce image body tissue organ . This test several advantage x-ray method , ability see clearly inside brain see chemical change might occur specific neurological disease . Also , since x-ray use , radiation risk . Radio wave generate change magnetic field measure analyzed computer . For procedure , subject lie table move metal cylinder ( MRI scanner ) strong magnetic field . Earplugs worn muffle loud thumping noise cause electrical switching radio frequency circuit . During MRI , subject receive injection contrast agent call Gadolinium , brighten image .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : Among factor contribute poor identification grey white matter pathology multiple sclerosis ( MS ) patient , low signal-to-noise ratio consequential poor resolution magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) obtain conventional magnetic field ( i.e . 1.5 Tesla ) play significant role . Preliminary result suggest 7T-MRI capability disclose characteristic chronic white matter lesion ' heterogeneity MS , see low field MRI . We aim extend result investigate whether lesion ' heterogeneous appearance pertain chronic lesion , i.e . study thus far , also newly form lesion , i.e . enhance upon gadolinium injection . The latter identify image 7T contrast injection MS patient know already active lesion . STUDY POPULATION : Up 145 patient ( age range : 18-65 , range Expanded Disability Status Scale : 0-4.5 ) definite MS accord Poser criterion diseases central nervous system resemble MS image stand point 120 age/gender-matched healthy volunteer enrol . DESIGN : Patients previously show meet clinical MRI criterion MS equivalent number gender- age-matched healthy volunteer study . Initially , patient healthy individual conventional 1.5Tesla MRI T1-weighted scan without contrast , whereas patient also post-contrast scan . Next , group subject image 3 Tesla 7 Tesla MRIs random order . In 3 Tesla 7 Tesla MRI study examination include follow sequence : 3 dimensional inversion-recovery-prepared fast spoil gradient recall image , 3D-fluid-attenuated inversion recovery double inversion recovery addition T1 T2 conventional weight image . A second group 15 patient without clinical relapse know active stage MS see post-contrast MRI imaged . Each patient may undergo standard 3T MRI within two week 7T MRI ( need , information regard his/her disease status otherwise available 3T MRI perform NIB protocol ) . The former allow ascertain advance his/her status lesion activity , thus provide adequate number patient active lesion image 7T . Each patient may need repeat his/her scan three time case magnetic instability image acquisition . Additional 3T 7T MRIs perform 1 6 month follow active lesion evolution time . A third group patient MS disease central nervous system manifest magnetic resonance imaging lesion white matter grey matter could mimic MS include . Each patient undergo 3T MRI inclusive post-contrast sequence well 7T MRI . OUTCOME MEASURES : The number cortical lesion well white matter deep grey abnormality compute image obtain 1.5 , 3 7 Tesla MRIs . The study aim conduct formal comparison cortical white matter lesion see 3 Tesla 7 Tesla . Instead , goal provide preliminary information use design formal analysis sensitivity two platform study abnormality see MS . Active lesion find conspicuous upon contrast injection compare T1 gradient echo image 7T . Additionally , evolution active lesion time 7T evaluate .</detailed_description>
