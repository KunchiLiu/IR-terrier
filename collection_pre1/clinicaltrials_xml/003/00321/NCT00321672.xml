	<detailed_description>Study C119 multicenter , randomize , double-blind , control evaluation efficacy safety NGX-4010 treatment painful HIV-associated neuropathy . Eligible subject painful HIV-associated neuropathy result HIV disease and/or antiretroviral drug exposure foot , average numeric pain rating scale ( NPRS ) score screen 3 9 ( inclusive ) . Up four patch cover area 1120 square centimeter could use single treatment administration study . Subjects randomly assign receive active NGX-4010 patch ( 8 % capsaicin ) low-concentration control patch ( 0.04 % capsaicin ) identical appearance , dos ( patch application duration ) either 30 60 minute , accord 2:1:2:1 allocation scheme . Subjects could stable chronic oral pain medication regimen , could use topical pain medication affect area . NPRS score average pain past 24 hour record daily even , begin day Screening Visit ( usually Day -14 ) . Subjects continued record NPRS score take-home diary evening day treatment even Termination Visit Week 12 . Subjects return interim follow-up visit Weeks 4 8 follow study treatment .</detailed_description>
