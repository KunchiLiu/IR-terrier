	<detailed_description>This study investigate `` second gas effect '' , phenomenon produce uptake nitrous oxide ( N2O ) lung , course typical anaesthetic . The effect increase concentration breathe gas lung . These include oxygen volatile anaesthetic agent sevoflurane , also normally administer along N2O . While second gas effect demonstrate previously , measure concentration volatile anaesthetic expire breath , study yet show significant effect concentration blood . The blood concentration fact important , directly determine concentration anaesthetic reaching brain , therefore effect depth anaesthesia . The second gas effect blood concentration may powerful expired concentration , due detrimental effect anaesthesia evenness distribution ventilation blood flow lung . The propose study two parallel component Parts . We wish ) measure magnitude second gas effect blood expire concentration sevoflurane ( Part 1 ) , ii ) see demonstrable difference exist effect blood expire concentration .</detailed_description>
