	<brief_summary>A four-level triage scale ( Geneva Emergency Triage Scale , GETS ) use since 1997 emergency department ( ED ) . A recent evaluation scale show instrument excellent intra-rater reliability insufficient inter-rater reliability . We also observe wide variability way triage nurse perform ( J Clin Epidemiology , 2006 press ) . These variation triage process mainly explain poor standardization vital sign measurement . Therefore , recently modify triage instrument introduce explicit criterion vital sign evaluation triage process . The objective study : - To evaluate inter- intra-rater reliability modify triage scale use computer simulator - To measure impact visual clue triage decision use triage simulator - To evaluate performance triage nurse chief physician triage decision . We expect observe : - improvement inter-rater reliability instrument compare previous version - good standardization systematic use vital sign measurement - high reliability visual clue give evaluator - low rate under- over-estimation emergency level .</brief_summary>
