	<brief_summary>The standard treatment Buruli ulcer disease ( BUD ) use surgery WHO advise streptomycin ( S , 15 mg/kg daily , intramuscularly ) rifampicin ( R,10 mg/kg daily ) along surgery . This preliminary advice base observation 21 patient pre-ulcerative lesion BUD , give daily SR treatment vary period time . In patient treated SR least 4 week , M. ulcerans could longer culture excised lesion . SR introduce without formal evaluation comparison treatment conduct publish , impression treatment beneficial may cure BUD without additional surgical management . This study protocol evaluate hypothesis early , limited lesion BUD ( pre-ulcerative ulcerated lesion , ≤ 10 cm maximum diameter ) , heal without recurrence use antimycobacterial drug therapy , without need debridement surgery . In endemic region Ghana , patient actively recruit follow ≥ 5 year age , early ( i.e. , onset &lt; 6 month ) BUD . - consent patient / care giver / legal representative - clinical evaluation , - analysis three 0.3 cm punch biopsy local anaesthesia . - disease confirmation : dry reagent-based polymerase chain reaction ( DRB-PCR IS2404 ) - randomization : either SR 8 week , 4 week SR follow R clarithromycin ( C ) - stratification : ulcerative pre-ulcerative lesion . Biopsies process histopathology , DRB-PCR- , microscopy , culture , genomic , sensitivity test . Lesions assess regularly progression heal treatment . Drug toxicity monitoring include blood cell count , liver enzymes renal test ; ECG audiographic test . Primary endpoint : healing without recurrence 12 month follow-up start treatment Secondary endpoint : reduction lesion surface area and/or clinically assess improvement completion treatment , avert need debridement surgery . Recurrences biopsied confirmation , use PCR , histopathology , culture . Sample size calculation : 2x74 fully evaluable patient ; 80 % power detect difference 20 % recurrence-free cure 12 month start treatment two group ( 60 versus 80 % ) .

	<brief_title>BURULICO Drug Trial Study Protocol : RCT SR8/SR4+CR4 , GHANA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Buruli ulcer disease ( BUD ) cause infection Mycobacterium ulcerans . It usually start small nodule skin may progress ulcerative lesion ; eventually large , usually painless ulcer may develop . When heals - surgery without - may cause severe scar result disability deformity . BUD emerge important infectious disease among rural population West Africa . The standard treatment use surgical excision form stage . In 2004 . The World Health Organisation advise use streptomycin ( S , 15 mg/kg daily , intramuscularly ) rifampicin ( R,10 mg/kg daily ) along surgery . This preliminary advice base observation 21 patient pre-ulcerative lesion BUD , give daily SR treatment vary period time . If patient receive treatment least 4 week , M. ulcerans could culture lesion excise . The treatment implement area poor access surgical facility , Pobe , Benin , although formal evaluation comparison treatment conduct publish , impression treatment probably beneficial may cure BUD without need additional surgical management . This study protocol design evaluate hypothesis early , limited lesion Buruli ulcer ( M. ulcerans disease ; pre-ulcerative ulcerated lesion , less equal 10 maximum diameter ) , heal without recurrence use antimycobacterial drug therapy , without need debridement surgery . In endemic region Ghana , active case find follow accrual patient - 5 year age , - limit early ( i.e. , onset less 6 month ) lesion Buruli ulcer . After appropriate consent patient / care giver legal representative , patient diagnose - clinical evaluation , - analysis three punch biopsy ( 0.3 cm ) local anaesthesia . Only patient confirmation M. ulcerans disease - presence dry reagent-based polymerase chain reaction ( DRB-PCR ) signal insertion sequence IS2404 , randomise receive either SR 8 week , 4 week SR follow oral treatment consist R clarithromycin ( C ) , allocate computer-generated program ; patient stratify ulcerative pre-ulcerative lesion . Patients meet clinical criterion M ulcerans disease PCR negative , offer 8 week RS treatment , presently provisionally recommend WHO , evaluate separately , accord protocol patient allocate 8 week RS treatment . All biopsy lesion subject histopathology , DRB-PCR- , microscopy , culture , genomic , sensitivity test external quality control laboratories Kumasi ( KNUST ) , Hamburg ( BNITM ) , Munich ( DITM ) Antwerp ( ITM ) . Lesions assess regularly progression heal treatment . Drug toxicity likewise monitor : renal audiographic test S C , ECG C , liver enzymes R C , blood cell count C. The primary endpoint heal without recurrence 12 month follow-up start treatment Secondary endpoint reduction lesion surface area and/or clinically assess improvement completion treatment , avert need debridement surgery . Recurrences biopsied confirmation , use PCR , histopathology , culture . In , 200 patient need screen accord protocol , 2x74 evaluable patient randomise base power analysis detect difference 20 % recurrence-free cure 12 month start treatment two group ( 60 versus 80 % ) . A Data Safety Monitoring Board make interim analysis .</detailed_description>
