	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil , leucovorin , oxaliplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Bevacizumab may also stop growth colon cancer block blood flow tumor . Giving combination chemotherapy together bevacizumab may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give combination chemotherapy together bevacizumab work treat patient stage IV colon cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Chemotherapy Bevacizumab Treating Patients With Stage IV Colon Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine rate major morbidity patient unresectable stage IV colon cancer synchronous asymptomatic primary tumor treat fluorouracil , leucovorin calcium , oxaliplatin ( mFOLFOX6 ) combination bevacizumab without resection primary tumor . Secondary - Determine rate specific event related intact primary tumor require hospitalization major intervention require surgery . - Determine rate ≥ grade 3 toxicity define Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events version 3.0 ( CTCAE v3.0 ) relate study therapy prior disease progression . - Determine overall survival patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive bevacizumab IV 30-90 minute , oxaliplatin IV give concurrently leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour day 1 fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour day 1 2 . Courses repeat every 14 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year study entry . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 90 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
