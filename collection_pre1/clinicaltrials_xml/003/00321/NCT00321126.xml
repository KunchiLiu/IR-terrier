	<brief_summary>Shigellosis major cause morbidity mortality young child Bangladesh develop country . Further , increase emergence resistance wide range antibiotic great concern . Another major public health problem Bangladesh malnutrition , closely link shigellosis high mortality . In Shigellosis , heavy nutritional burden place child vital micronutrient vitamin A lost urine . We recently find immune response S. Flexneri infection lower child severely malnourish ( weight-for-age≤65 % percentage National Centre Health Statistics median ) compare child weight-for-age &gt; 65-75 % . T cell response primarily affect lowered CD4/CD8 ratio , lower proliferative response T cell mitogen , Conconavalin A ( ConA ) phytohaemagglutinin ( PHA ) . However , proliferation pheripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMs ) lower presence autologous plasma suggest factor ( ) plasma , probably nutritional , rather defect cell responsible . In child S. dysenteriae 1 infection , proliferative response PHA similarly lower presence autologous plasma inhibition correlate lower transferring level plasma weight-for-age child . Also severely malnourished child either S. flexneri S. dysenteriae 1 infection severely ill . These findingings show immunity malnourishrd child shigella infection impair may lead severe illness . As zinc profound effect immunity well clinical outcome diarrhoeal disease , possible zinc deficiency may factor reduce immunity increase severity acute illness malnourish child shigellosis . In study , investigate effect zinc supplementation , double blind placebo control trial , inflammatory response , outcome acute illness growth follow recovery acute illness S. flexneri infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zinc Supplementation Shigella Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design : The study double blind randomise clinical trial use zinc placebo use multivitamin base.Study subject : Fifty six child sex age 12-59 month study study ward attend Dhaka Hospital International Centre Diarrhoeal Disease Research , Bangladesh shigellosis . The patient initially screen study . Stool sample examine microscopically stool culture enteric bacterial pathogen . Children whose stool culture positive shigella specie include study . Selection patient base follow criterion : age 12-59 month , moderate malnutrition ( 61-75 % Weight / Age – NCHS Median ) , duration diarrhoea 5 day , culture confirm shigella spp stool enrolment . Measurements weight length ( height ) perform use WHO Manual28 . The exclusion criterion follow : measles infection past six month ; presence obvious systemic illness , pneumonia , meningitis , septicaemia , leukemoid reaction , haemolytic uremic syndrome etc ; zinc supplementation ; severe malnutrition ; residence location require journey &gt; 2 hour Dhaka Hospital ICDDR , B ; refusal give consent . Signed informed consent obtain guardian paediatric patient enrolment accord guideline ethical review committee ICDDR , B . The study conduct January 1999 –December 2002.Study Groups : There two study group , one receive zinc acetate multivitamin syrup antibiotic i.e . pivmecillinum placebo pivmecillinum . Composition syrup : For group , base syrup multivitamin syrup composition . In addition , zinc acetate ( 20 mg elemental Zn/ 5 ml ) mix multivitamin syrup zinc supplement group receive 20 mg elemental zinc per day.Composition base/ multivitamin syrup : Every 5 ml multivitamin syrup contain follow : vitamin A ( 3000IU ) , vitamin D ( 600 IU ) , thiamin ( 1.2 mg ) , riboflavin ( 2.0 mg ) , nicotinamide ( 6.0 mg ) calcium pantothanate ( 6 mg ) .Dose zinc : Subjects zinc group receive 20 mg elemental zinc acetate per day twice-daily dose period 2 week . Methods : A block randomization procedure perform use random table assign equal number patient zinc supplemented placebo group . Twenty eight group allocate zinc placebo use block randomization . Double blind do identical colour bottle syrup label serial number , allocate child 2 group chronologically . The zinc syrup contain zinc multivitamin mask taste flavor indistinguishable consistency , appearance taste control syrup contain multivitamin . The micronutrient supplement prepare Acme Laboratories , Dhaka Bangladesh . The experimental group receive zinc syrup contain multivitamin ( vitamin give twice recommended dietary allowance ) 2 divided dos daily 2 week start day admission . The comparison group receive multivitamin syrup alone . All subject receive pivmecillinum dose 60 mg/kg/day 4 divide dos 5 day . In group patient , diarrhea subside within 3-5 day . During hospitalization study child receive standard hospital diet 100-125 kcal 3-5 g protein per kg body weight daily mixed food . When discharged day-7 , mother give bottle syrup instruct feed child supplement daily home rest 7 day . On 14th day , health assistant visit household , measure amount syrup take also enquired mother problem encounter feed syrup . Children follow fortnightly 6 month onset diarrhoea assess morbidity growth . The follow investigated study period –Clinical evaluation : duration illness , presence blood stool , tenesmus , weight changes.Assessment growth growth velocity : Measurements include weight , height , triceps skinfold thickness ( TSF ) use standard technique ( WHO ) 28 . These do supplementation discharge . After supplementation , child measure every two week home . Weights obtain near 10 g use electronic digital scale ( Secca model 770 , Sweden ) standarised 5 10 kg standard weight everyday morning evening . Recubent length measure child less two year age use slide board infantometer ( Harpenden , St. Albans , England ) . In old child , stand height determine Stadiometer . Mean two consecutive height measurement near 0.5 cm record observe value . Measurements compare Median NCHS Standard . Health worker extensively train anthropometric measurement , minimum intra-individual inter individual variation attaint . Statistical Analysis : The data check daily record investigator , clean enter microcomputer use SPSS/PC+ ( Windows 10.0 ) . Data analysis perform use SPSS/PC+ ( Windows 10.0 ) EPI Info ( Nutrition ) version 3.2.2 . The consistency check do use logical program . Student pair t-tests use data normally distribute non- parametric Mann-Whitney U test use distribution skew . Time sequence proportion recovery compare two group use Kaplan Meier survival analysis . Proportions compare use chi-squared test . Repeated measure analyse variance also undertaken evaluate change weight gain length gain follow-up period . Statistical significance accept 5 percent level .</detailed_description>
