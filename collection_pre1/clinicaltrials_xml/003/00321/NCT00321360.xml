	<brief_title>Effect Site Controlled , Reaction Time Safeguarded , Patient Maintained Sedation With Propofol Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive conscious sedation dentistry endoscopy usually treat intermittent bolus dos intravenous midazolam ( administer operator-sedationist ) . The safety regime question report 13 % patient desaturating 80 % recovery area follow sedation endoscopy . Mortality occur 0.05 % endoscopy patient ( approximately 60 % due hypoxaemia ) . The aim work , therefore , look provide sedation safer well efficacious . The drug propofol , agent commonly use induce general anaesthesia UK , also frequently administer intravenously anaesthetist low dos provide conscious sedation patient undergo unpleasant procedure i.e . patient become relaxed , anxiety-free , maintain verbal contact throughout . The technique patient maintain sedation use drug propofol ( patient increase amount sedation ( propofol ) receive press demand button attach standard infusion device ) use anaesthetist evaluate since 1997 . Several recent study publish submit publication research group patient maintain sedation use drug propofol show method sedation safe effective dental patient ( 120 patient studied case sedation ) . It also show method , compare establish method sedation oral surgery ( dentist administer dos midazolam intravenously ) , produce quick recovery less anxiety prior surgery . The routine use propofol traditionally restricted anaesthetist , much high dose general anaesthesia produce possible loss airway patency . Currently safety feature predominantly patient become sedated press patient demand button hence increase amount propofol receiving . Also device ensures blood brain concentration equilibrate within 10 % another successful demand propofol make ( usually take approximately two minute ) allow maximum calculated brain concentration 3 micrograms/milliliter propofol . The device also start decrease calculate brain concentration propofol demand button press six minute . Despite encouraging result also find recent pilot study involve 20 healthy volunteer instruct try make unconscious 2 case sedation ( one briefly lose verbal contact require supplemental oxygen short time ) . This however unsafe presence anaesthetist . Over sedation , however , never demonstrate oral surgery patient previous study . This may due high level anxiety dental patient affect response propofol . We therefore incorporate additional safety feature exist previously study patient maintain sedation system may decrease eliminate small risk sedation . All safety feature retain addition patient demand button also use monitor reaction time one minutely interval . It known propofol slow reaction time give individual another recent study 40 patient undergoing general anaesthesia plan surgery use propofol , patient ' reaction time record awake induction anaesthesia instruct patient press handheld button quickly possible response handset vibrating . The calculated effect site ( brain ) concentration propofol increase incrementally reaction time monitor stage patient could longer press button . The data study ( deteriorate patient reaction time increase brain concentration propofol ) analyse information use provide additional safeguard within system prevent sedation i.e . patient 's reaction time deterioration certain percentage prevent able self-administer propofol . Furthermore system actually start decrease brain concentration propofol patient ' reaction time become slow . The patient demand button use monitor reaction time one minutely intervals well administer propofol . We hope eliminate small risk sedation wish recruit 20 healthy volunteer assess safety efficacy reaction time safeguard , patient-maintained sedation system . After express interest recruit volunteer give volunteer information leaflet research take home read . The volunteer give ample opportunity ask question regard research give inform write consent study visit . The volunteer intravenous cannula sit routine monitoring apply continuous observation ( blood pressure , ECG oxygen saturation ) . The cannula connect effect-site control infusion system consist Graseby 3400 infusion pump backbar microprocessor ( patient 's age weight enter ) , program pharmacokinetic data describe distribution elimination propofol . The microprocessor also connect investigator 's laptop . Whilst volunteer connect propofol infusion , experienced anaesthetist ( FRCA qualification ) train assistant constant attendance . There ready access appropriate resuscitation equipment drug . Recordings patient 's vital sign data collection sheet make prior sedation every 5 minute sedation period end ( see supplement ) . The anaesthetist also record volunteer 's sedation score reaction time challenge ( see supplement ) . For reaction time challenge actual reaction time correspond effect site ( brain ) concentration log onto laptop . The way device work explain volunteer give handset hold button top . They hold throughout procedure . The handset vibrate interval one minute throughout procedure volunteer instruct press button twice ( double click ) soon handset vibrates order record volunteer 's reaction time . Three baseline reaction time record prior sedation , first value discard second two value average give baseline reaction time . We also tell way demand propofol sedation period also press button twice within one second . The device set achieve effect-site ( brain ) concentration 1.0 micrograms/millilitre ( mcg/ml ) . Once effect concentration achieve control button activate administration propofol volunteer instruct `` try make unconscious '' . The volunteer increase effect site concentration 0.2 mcg/ml successful double press ( maximum 3 mcg/ml ) . A double press successful reaction time measurement provide blood brain concentration propofol equilibrate within 10 % provide reaction time become prolonged 150 % baseline value . In case drug increment permit effect site concentration maintain level two minute time successful demand press would occur reaction time become less 150 % . In addition even prolong reaction time great 200 % baseline would actually lead reduction effect site concentration propofol . If volunteer becomes unresponsive verbal command reach set maximum effect site concentration 3 mcg/ml , unlikely event volunteer desaturates level 90 % show sign respiratory depression , infusion end . The volunteer look anaesthetist ( ensure airway maintain , supplemental oxygen give ventilation adequate ) awake responsive speech point take sedation suite recovery room . Otherwise sedation period end 30 minute period device decrease brain concentration propofol three successive occasion ( due reaction time slow ) . The volunteer transfer recovery area , monitor ready discharge accord sedation suite criterion . Just prior discharge volunteer complete short questionnaire ass recall satisfaction ( see supplement ) . As stated volunteer information leaflet , volunteer withdraw study time without give reason without care way affect .</detailed_description>
