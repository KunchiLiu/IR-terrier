	<brief_summary>The objective study evaluate safety effectiveness experimental drug AST-120 treating patient mild moderately severe Crohn 's disease fistula . The study test whether patient receive AST-120 experience great reduction number drain fistulas improvement Crohn 's disease symptom versus patient receive placebo ( material contain active medication ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy AST-120 Mild Moderate Crohn 's Patients With Fistulas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The experimental drug AST-120 compose black , odorless spherical carbon particles 2g sachet ( aluminum foil pouch ) . The placebo consist microcrystalline cellulose sphere , Celphere CP-305 , stain match appearance AST-120 , 2g sachet ( aluminum foil pouch ) . Both AST-120 placebo oral ( take mouth ) preparation . Both tasteless . To take product , patient tear open sachet , drop content directly tongue wash 8 ounce water . Patients randomly assign ( like toss coin ) , receive either AST-120 placebo . Patients 50/50 chance receive placebo . Patients participate study require take single dose study drug ( AST-120 placebo ) 3 time day , 30 minute meal , 8 week , evaluate Week 4 Week 8 . This 'blinded ' treatment , mean neither patient study doctor know patient receive study drug placebo . If , end first full course randomize treatment , ( 8 week ) , patient show improvement condition , may option receive alternate blind treatment one treatment course ( 8 week ) . The study doctor discus option patient individually . During second course treatment , patient evaluate Week 12 Week 16 . If patient respond alternate blind treatment , condition worsens 4 week ( assessed Week 12 ) , may remove study discretion investigator . If patient respond either initial treatment alternate blind treatment , monthly doctor/clinic visit 6 month ( Week 24 ) , condition worsens relapse . Patients receive study drug follow-up period . Relapse define study : - increase 1 number drain fistula 2 sequential visit versus number present time response ( response define least 50 % reduction number drain fistula either Week 8 , patient receive alternate blind treatment , Week 16 ) . There maximum 8 patient evaluation visit study ( Screen , Baseline , Week 4 , Week 8 , Week 12 , Week 16 , Week 20 Week 24 ) . Evaluations visit include review concomitant medication , medical history/adverse event , physical exam , fistula exam , blood draw safety lab , urine pregnancy test female , measurement body weight . Patients also ask keep daily diary record frequency bowel movement , general well-being , use antidiarrheal medication . Treatment failure study define one follow occur prior Week 8 : - The need additional therapy dose increase treatment Crohn 's disease , include increase corticosteroid dose high baseline - Clinical/symptomatic development abscess - Clinical/symptomatic evidence stricture - The need surgical intervention Crohn 's disease - The patient withdraws study Patients discontinue study time one follow complication occur : - Development abscess symptomatic stricture - The need surgical intervention Crohn 's disease - Occurrence event opinion investigator warrant discontinuation patient study In addition , patient whose CDAI score risen &gt; = 70 point baseline rise 400 discontinue study . Administration additional therapy dose increase concomitant medication ( include corticosteroid ) control Crohn 's disease high baseline receive study drug ( initial randomize treatment alternate blind treatment ) require discontinuation patient study . Discontinued patient evaluated termination visit document lack treatment efficacy study treatment give .</detailed_description>
