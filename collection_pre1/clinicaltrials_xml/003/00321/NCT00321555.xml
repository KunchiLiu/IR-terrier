	<brief_summary>Background : - About 80 % patient hairy cell leukemia ( HCL ) tumor cell protein surface call CD25 . - The experimental drug LMB-2 recombinant immunotoxin show kill leukemia lymphoma cell CD25 protein . ( A recombinant immunotoxin genetically engineer drug two part - protein bind target cancer cell , toxin kill cancer cell bind . ) Objectives : - To evaluate safety effectiveness LMB-2 patient HCL whose cancer cell contain CD25 protein . - To evaluate effect LMB-2 immune system , determine drug metabolize body examine side effect . Eligibility : -Adults hairy cell leukemia whose tumor cell CD25 surface Design : - Up 27 patient may include study . - Patients receive infusion LMB-2 vein every day three dos ( day 1 , 3 , 5 ) , constitute one treatment cycle . - Patients may receive six treatment cycle every 4 week unless cancer worsens develop unacceptable side effect . - Blood drawn weekly various test . - Before cycle follow-up visit , disease status evaluate physical examination , blood test , chest x-ray electrocardiogram . - Before first cycle , patient may CT scan , echocardiogram ( heart ultrasound test ) bone marrow biopsy . With patient 's permission , test may repeat cycle also .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : About 80 % patient hairy cell leukemia ( HCL ) malignant cell express CD25 ( Tac IL2Ra ) . Normal rest B- T-cells express CD25 . LMB-2 anti-CD25 recombinant immunotoxin contain variable domain MAb anti-Tac truncate Pseudomonas exotoxin . A phase I trial NCI find MTD LMB-2 40 microg/Kg IV give every day 3 dos ( QOD x3 ) . The common adverse event transient fever , hypoalbuminemia transaminase elevation . In trial , 4 4 patient chemoresistant HCL major response , include one complete ( CR ) 3 partial remission . The patient CR enter trial transfusion dependent still normal hemoglobin platelet count 7 year later . Because HCL frequently CD22+ CD25+ ( 100 vs 80 % ) , HCL patient subsequently treat anti-CD22 recombinant immunotoxin BL22 HCL patient treat LMB-2 . BL22 induce 25 CRs 51 evaluable HCL patient . LMB-2 may useful patient incompletely respond BL22 , may distribute evenly extravascular site disease . Moreover , BL22 LMB-2 cause hemolytic uremic syndrome ( HUS ) 7 patient , 6 HCL , several patient could benefit LMB-2 . Thus , LMB-2 may useful potentially lifesaving agent patient unable receive respond adequately BL22 . Objectives : The purpose study determine activity anti-Tac ( Fv ) -PE38 ( LMB-2 ) patient CD25-expressing hairy cell leukemia ( HCL ) . The primary endpoint trial response rate . We also evaluate response duration , LMB-2 immunogenicity , pharmacokinetics , toxicity , monitor soluble Tac level serum . Eligibility : Patients must CD25+ HCL cell flow cytometry , cytopenia high circulate HCL count , prior treatment inability receive BL22 , prior treatment cladribine , ECOG PS 0-2 , least 18 year old , ALT AST grade 0-2 , albumin grade 0-1 , bilirubin le equal 2.2 , creatinine le equal 1.4 creatinine clearance great equal 50 , lack high level neutralize antibody , lack anti-CD25 Mab therapy 12 week systemic treatment 4 week , prior treatment LMB-2 , lack uncontrolled illness include 2nd malignancy , HIV hepatitis C positivity , coumadin therapy , LVEF great equal 45 % , DLCO great equal 55 % , FEV1 great equal 60 % . Design : Patients receive LMB-2 40 microg/Kg QOD x3 interval least 25 day 6 cycle . Retreatment permit absence neutralize antibody progressive disease . Patients CR may receive 2 consolidation cycle , 4 consolidation cycle CR minimal residual disease . Dose level : LMB-2 40 microg/Kg QOD x3 Expected Accrual : 5-10 patients/year , total 25 patient</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Histopathological evidence CD25+ HCL confirm NIH pathology department . This require monoclonal population peripheral malignant lymphocyte CD25 positive fluorescence activate cell sorting ( FACS ) antiCD25 antibody . Positive expression FACS assay define 2 time mean fluorescence intensity ( MFI ) control antibody FACS . HCLv ( HCL variant ) usually CD25 negative , eligibility would require CD25+ HCLv . 2 . At least one follow indication treatment : neutropenia ( ANC le 1000 cells/ microL ) , anemia ( Hgb less 10g/dL ) , thrombocytopenia ( Plt le 100,000/ microL ) , absolute lymphocyte count great 20,000 cells/microL symptomatic splenomegaly . 3 . Previous treatment inability receive BL22 HA22 recombinant immunotoxin . Patients must least 2 prior systemic therapy , include 2 course purine nucleoside analog ( PNA ) , 1 course either rituximab BRAF inhibitor follow single prior course PNA . 4 . ECOG performance status 0 2 . 5 . At least 18 year old . 6 . Understand give inform consent . 7 . A negative pregnancy test female patient childbearing potential . Women must breastfeed . 8 . ALT AST less equal 5times upper limit normal . Albumin great equal 3.0 gm/dL . Total bilirubin less equal 2.2 mg/dL . 9 . Creatinine le equal 1.4 mg/dL creatinine clearance great equal 50 ml/min . 10 . Serum neutralize less equal 75 % activity 1 microg/mL LMB2 use bioassay . 11 . No systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy within 4 week enrollment systemic steroid ( except stable dos Prednisone less equal 20 mg/day , 4 dos steroid give nontherapy reason ) within 4 week enrollment . 12 . No antiCD25 monoclonal antibody therapy within 12 week enrollment . 13 . No prior treatment LMB2 . 14 . Patients may receive investigational agent . 15 . Patients uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients HIV hepatitis C. Patients would exclude hepatitis B surface antigen positivity Lamivudine . Patients receive coumadin . Patients leave ventricular ejection fraction le 45 % . Patients DLCO le 55 % normal FEV1 le 60 % normal base either NIH USA normal range . Patients active 2nd malignancy require systemic treatment .</criteria>
