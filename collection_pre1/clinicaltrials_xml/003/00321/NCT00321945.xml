	<brief_summary>It well know atrial fibrillation ( AF ) atrial flutter occur frequently type cardiac surgery . ( 1-4 ) Postoperative AF associate significant morbidity , long hospital stay , high related cost . Currently , common procedure premedicate patient antiarrhythmic drug elective cardiac surgery . Treatments beta blocker , Amiodarone , electrical pacing use help prevent morbidity associate pot-operative AF . ( 5 ) Renin-angiotensin system ( RAS ) activation may contribute AF . Several clinical trial suggest inhibitor system may reduce incidence AF . ( 6-12 ) Patients AF know increased level angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) type angiotensin receptor . ( 13-15 ) Data animal study perform group suggest cardiac ACE overexpression may lead arrhythmic ion channel change . ( 16 ; 17 ) Although study group yet , would reasonable conclude use ACE inhibitor angiotensin receptor blocker ( ARBs ) would decrease incidence AF post-operative patient ,</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>2.0 Objectives Based discussion , hypothesize patient premedicated ACE Inhibitors ARBs decrease incidence post-operative AF atrial flutter . This study retrospective cohort analysis patient underwent elective cardiac surgery 2000-2005 Emory University Hospital , Crawford Long Hospital , Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center evaluate relationship pre-operative ACE inhibitor ARB use incidence post-operative atrial arrhythmias.. This study undertaken preparation funding proposal prospective trial . 3.0 Patient Selection 3.1 Eligibility criterion : 1 . All patient patient underwent elective cardiac surgery Emory University Hospital , Crawford Long Hospital , VA Medical Center 2000-2005 . 3.2 Ineligibility criterion : 1 . Emergent operation . 2 . The presence AF atrial flutter time surgery . 3 . Patients without adequate documentation atrial rhythm follow surgery . 4 . New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class IV heart failure time surgery . 5 . Hyperthyroidism 6 . Implanted device design active management atrial arrhythmia pace defibrillation 7 . Known illicit drug use 8 . Known ethanol abuse 9 . Electrophysiological ablation atrial tachycardia within 6 month operation . 4.0 Registration randomization : none 5.0 Therapy : none 6.0 Pathology : none 7.0 Patient assessment : none 8.0 Data collection : Data collect review patient 's hospital chart , telemetry recording , ECGs document presence absence AF atrial flutter hospital admission cardiac surgery . The presence absence atrial fibrillation diagnose basis electrocardiographic recording confirm cardiologist . Demographic data collect include : age , race , sex , body mass index , blood pressure , NYHA classification , Killip classification , history previous myocardial infarction , hypertension , diabetes , smoking , alcohol use , antiarrhythmic drug use , presence type pacemaker , history AF atrial flutter , previous cardiovascular event , type operation , length operation . Patients enrol study give unique study number . No follow data require patient . 9.0 Statistical consideration : This study design retrospective chart review cohort patient undergoing cardiac surgery determine association pre-operative ARB ACE inhibitor use incidence post-operative atrial fibrillation atrial flutter . The null hypothesis association preoperative use ACE Inhibitors ARBs postoperative AF atrial flutter . Within cohort , patient AF atrial flutter compare without atrial arrhythmias post-operative period . Baseline data two group express mean Â± standard deviation continuous variable , frequency categorical variable . Differences baseline characteristic group examine use Fisher exact Mann-Whitney test categorical continuous variable , respectively . Quantification association pre-operative ACE Inhibitors ARBs presence atrial fibrillation model logistical regression analysis adjust variable may affect arrhythmia frequency .</detailed_description>
