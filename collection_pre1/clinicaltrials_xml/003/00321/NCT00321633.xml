	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . It yet know whether carboplatin effective docetaxel treat patient metastatic genetic breast cancer . PURPOSE : This randomized phase II trial study carboplatin see well work compare docetaxel treat woman metastatic genetic breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carboplatin Docetaxel Treating Women With Metastatic Genetic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare safety effectiveness carboplatin v docetaxel woman metastatic breast cancer BRCA1 BRCA2 gene mutation . Secondary - Compare time disease progression patient treat regimen . - Compare progression-free survival patient treat carboplatin v docetaxel . OUTLINE : This randomize , open-label , multicenter , pilot study . Patients stratify accord gene mutation ( BRCA1 v BRCA2 ) , prior adjuvant taxane chemotherapy ( yes v ) , liver lung metastasis affect parenchyma ( yes v ) , Jewish ancestry parent grandparent ( yes v ) , first-line treatment v second-line treatment . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive carboplatin IV 1 hour day 1 . - Arm 2 : Patients receive docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 . In arm , treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients disease progression 3 6 course treatment may crossover alternative treatment arm . If progression present 3 course crossover arm , patient may receive treatment discretion oncologist . Patients respond tolerate treatment well , may give 2 course accordance local center policy , although encourage . Patients HER2-positive disease may receive trastuzumab ( Herceptin® ) IV every 7 21 day . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically survival . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 148 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
