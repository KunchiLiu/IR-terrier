	<brief_title>AZD2171 Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory B-Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate response rate patient relapse refractory B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( B-CLL ) treat AZD2171 . II . Evaluate toxicity AZD2171 patient relapse refractory B-CLL . III . Evaluate complete response rate , progression-free overall survival distribution , duration response patient relapse refractory B-CLL treat AZD2171 . IV . Assess vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 ( VEGFR-2 ) protein phosphorylation level B-CLL cell use pretreatment sample evaluate association Rai stage study entry clinical response AZD2171 . V. Perform preclinical test AZD2171 induction B-CLL cell apoptosis/cell death use pretreatment sample , evaluate ability downregulate phosphorylation status VEGFR-2 B-CLL cell compare vitro sample without AZD2171 . VI . Study difference vitro level B-CLL cell apoptosis/cell death alteration VEGFR-2 phosphorylation use pretreatment sample without AZD2171 difference correlate clinical outcome . VII . Assess clinical response associate change bone marrow vascularity . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral AZD2171 daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients undergo blood sample biopsy baseline periodically throughout study biomarker correlative study . After completion study therapy , patient follow periodically 5 year study entry .</detailed_description>
