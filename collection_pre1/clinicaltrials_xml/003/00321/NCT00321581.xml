	<brief_summary>Background : - AZD2171 experimental drug may slow growth cancer block angiogenesis ( formation new blood vessel ) . - Cancer growth dependent angiogenesis nutrition . - Inhibiting angiogenesis new approach cancer therapy . Objectives : - To determine side effect AZD2171 child adolescents cancer . - To determine high dose AZD2171 safely give child adolescent cancer . - To study body handle AZD2171 . - To determine effect AZD2171 various factor related angiogenesis . - To determine AZD2171 inhibit cancer growth child adolescent . Eligibility : -Children adolescent 2-18 year age treatment-resistant solid tumor cancer acute myelogenous leukemia . Design : - About 40 patient may include study . - AZD2171 give mouth treatment cycle day 28 day . Treatment may continue unless cancer worsen unacceptable side effect develop . - Patients periodic physical examination , blood urine test image test ( CT , X-rays , MRI ) evaluate disease throughout course treatment . Additional blood test do study body handle AZD2171 , look protein stimulate angiogenesis , determine certain blood vessel cell affect AZD2171 , research purpose . - Biopsy tissue ( available ) examine receptor new blood vessel formation .</brief_summary>

Eligibility : -Children adolescent ( great 2 yr less 19 year age ) histologically confirm relapsed refractory extracranial solid tumor measurable evaluable . Design : - Cediranib administer orally , daily . Treatment cycle 28 day break treatment cycle . The start dose level 12 mg/m ( 2 ) /d escalation 17 , 25 , 35 , 50 mg/ ( 2 ) /d , due dose limit toxicity initial 2 subject enrol 12 mg/m ( 2 ) /d protocol amend restart dose escalation 8 mg/m ( 2 ) /d . - Detailed pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic study perform first 28 day treatment cycle . - The trial follow standard phase I design 3 6 patient per dose level standard definition MTD DLT . Up 28 patient enter trial .</detailed_description>
