	<brief_title>Coronary CT Angiography Asymptomatic Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients diabetes mellitus increase risk development coronary heart disease . Available test accurately predict diabetic patient great risk suffer coronary event . The recent development coronary CT angiography allow non-invasive image coronary narrowing disease ( atheroma ) coronary arterial wall earlier stage disease development coronary arterial narrowing . In study collect readily available patient medical data relate diabetes complication coronary artery disease risk factor . In addition patient refer exercise stress test eye examination . The coronary CT angiogram carefully examine early sign coronary artery disease . In event find CT scan require medical therapy communicate patient treat physician . In event find stress test CT scan require medical work-up patient refer cardiology clinic . In general patient follow regular diabetic clinic family practitioner . In event acute symptom next year possibly related heart disease require emergency room examination patient request report emergency room hospital CT study perform whenever possible.In event repeat CT scan perform examine new finding present . In event new complaint require referral hospital clinic patient refer assessment cardiology clinic repeat CT scan may perform deem relevant . Outcomes patient examine 2 year later use computerize database . Patients undergoing hospitalization follow period least 2-3 year contact study staff obtain detail event hospital finding . An analysis wil perform value CT angiography relation traditional risk factor available medical data prediction later coronary heart disease vascular event .</detailed_description>
