	<brief_summary>It well know abnormal heart beat top part heart , atrial fibrillation ( AF ) atrial flutter ( Aflut ) , occur frequently type cardiac surgery . Postoperative AF Aflut associate significant morbidity , long hospital stay , high related cost . Currently therapies marginally effective prevent abnormal heart beat . The incidence abnormal heart beat cardiac surgery seem function amount inflammation oxidative stress induce . Our group others show atrial abnormal heart beat associate increased oxidative stress . Thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) medication use treat diabetes . Beside glucose lower effect , TZDs show exhibit anti-inflammatory antioxidant property . Therefore , propose retrospectively analyze effect pre-operative TZDs incidence post-operative AF Aflut . This study involve retrospective chart review without patient contact patient undergone cardiac surgery Emory University Hospital , Crawford Long Hospital , VA Medical Center 2000 2005 . This study preparatory funding proposal prospective trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Retrospective Study Role Thiazolidinediones Reduce Incidence Atrial Arrhythmias</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1.0 Background Cardiac surgery associate many perioperative complication , include supraventricular arrhythmia . ( 1-4 ) Atrial fibrillation occur 15 40 % patient coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) 60 % CABG valve repair . It lead significant complication stroke , prolonged hospitalization , increase mortality morbidity . ( 1 ; 5 ) Post-operative atrial arrhythmia seem relate degree inflammation oxidative stress induce surgery . ( 2-4 ) Our group others show atrial arrhythmia associate increase oxidative stress . ( 6-10 ) Moreover , increase oxidative stress associate angiotensin II-mediated NADPH oxidase activation lead electrical abnormality likely propagate arrhythmia . ( 11 ; 12 ) Thiazolidinediones ( TZDs ) antidiabetic agent enhance insulin sensitivity activate peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor ( PPAR ) gamma . Beside glucose lower effect , TZDs show exhibit anti-inflammatory antioxidant property . ( 13-17 ) 2.0 Objectives Based discussion , hypothesize pre-operative use TZDs decrease post-operative AF Aflut incidence . This study retrospective cohort analysis patient underwent elective cardiac surgery 2000-2005 Emory University Hospital , Crawford Long Hospital , Atlanta Veterans Affairs Medical Center evaluate relationship pre-operative TZD use incidence post-operative atrial arrhythmias.. This study undertaken preparation funding proposal prospective trial . 3.0 Patient Selection 3.1 Eligibility criterion : 1 . All patient patient underwent elective cardiac surgery Emory University Hospital , Crawford Long Hospital , VA Medical Center 2000-2005 . 3.2 Ineligibility criterion : 1 . Emergent operation . 2 . The presence AF Aflut time surgery . 3 . Patients without adequate documentation atrial rhythm follow surgery . 4 . New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) class IV heart failure time surgery . 5 . Hyperthyroidism 6 . Implanted device design active management atrial arrhythmia pace defibrillation 7 . Known illicit drug use 8 . Known ethanol abuse 9 . Electrophysiological ablation atrial tachycardia within 6 month operation . 4.0 Registration randomization : none 5.0 Therapy : none 6.0 Pathology : none 7.0 Patient assessment : none 8.0 Data collection : Data collect review patient 's hospital chart , telemetry recording , ECGs document presence absence AF Aflut hospital admission cardiac surgery . The presence absence atrial fibrillation diagnose basis electrocardiographic recording confirm cardiologist . Demographic data collect include : age , race , sex , body mass index , blood pressure , NYHA classification , Killip classification , history previous myocardial infarction , hypertension , diabetes , smoking , alcohol use , antiarrhythmic drug use , presence type pacemaker , history AF Aflut , previous cardioversions , type operation , length operation . Patients enrol study give unique study number . No follow data require patient . 9.0 Statistical consideration : This study design retrospective chart review cohort patient undergoing cardiac surgery determine association pre-operative TZD use incidence post-operative atrial fibrillation Aflut . The null hypothesis association preoperative use TZDs postoperative AF Aflut . Within cohort , patient AF Aflut compare without atrial arrhythmias post-operative period . Baseline data two group express mean Â± standard deviation continuous variable , frequency categorical variable . Differences baseline characteristic group examine use Fisher exact Mann-Whitney test categorical continuous variable , respectively . Quantification association pre-operative TZD presence atrial fibrillation model logistical regression analysis adjust variable may affect arrhythmia frequency .</detailed_description>
