	<detailed_description>50 leave side breast cancer patient randomize receive breast/chest wall irradiation without ABC . Patients receive radiation therapy dose 180-200 cGy per fraction 23-27 fraction total dose 4600 - 4860 cGy . Additional radiation lumpectomy bed mastectomy scar discretion treat physician . The total dose tumor bed mastectomy scar exceed 6600cGy . Treatments give Monday Friday . After completion radiation therapy , patient see follow schedule : A follow examination take place every 3-6 month first two year , every 4-6 month year next 3 year . After 5 year follow-up evaluation occur annually . A SPECT scan obtain 6 month post therapy .
