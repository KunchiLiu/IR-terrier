	<brief_summary>The primary objective study determine emergency department patient Transient Ischemic Attack ( TIA ) manage use TIA `` accelerate diagnostic protocol '' , `` ADP '' , demonstrate significant decrease index visit length stay cost , comparable diagnostic 90-day clinical outcome relative TIA patient randomize traditional inpatient care . The secondary objective evaluate potential role TIA risk stratification tool determine time diagnostic endpoint group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) define neurological deficit last less 24 hour , last less one hour , bring focal cerebral retinal ischemia . TIAs common , estimated 300,000 event occur annually estimate 5 million Americans give diagnosis TIA . Furthermore , TIA essentially `` smoke fire '' patient . Studies show within 90 day emergency department diagnosis TIA , 10.5 % patient suffer stroke , occur within two day ED visit . Twenty one percent stroke fatal 64 % disabling . Additionally , 2.6 % TIA patient die , 2.6 % suffer adverse cardiovascular event , 12.7 % recurrent TIAs . Roughly 15 % patient stroke report history TIA . For many patient , stroke consider devastating event bad death . In 1999 stroke third lead cause death United States ( National center health statistic , U.S. dept health human service ) . The national direct indirect cost stroke estimate $ 51 billion annually.7 The management disposition emergency department patient TIA entirely clear . It mutually agree upon guideline write American Heart Association ( AHA ) National Stroke Association ( NSA ) management TIA , standard emergency medicine textbook , patient symptoms suggestive stroke TIA require urgent evaluation set emergency department . Furthermore , evaluation include history , physical , ECG . AHA guideline emergency medicine text recommend initial evaluation include appropriate blood test base history CT imaging brain . All agree patient noncardioembolic cause TIA receive antiplatelet therapy TIA patient atrial fibrillation receive anticoagulation . `` Prompt '' `` Urgent '' image carotid artery detect stenosis great 70 % also agree upon since urgent carotid endarterectomy believe beneficial group . However optimal time endarterectomy patient high-grade carotid stenosis unclear . NSA guideline emergency medicine text recommend hospitalization patient new onset TIA imaging study , carotid doppler , perform urgently . However separate review TIA management , hospitalization identify area uncertainty suggest management set Emergency Department Observation Unit ( EDOU ) might cost effective alternative .</detailed_description>
