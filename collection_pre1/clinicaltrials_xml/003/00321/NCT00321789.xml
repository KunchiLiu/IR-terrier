	<brief_summary>We examine effect patient-spouse intervention lower LDL-C increase patient treatment adherence . A randomized control trial compare one-year , telephone-based patient-spouse intervention usual care . The primary outcome LDL-C measure three time ( baseline , 6 month , 11 month ) ; secondary outcome adherence medication , diet , exercise , also assess baseline , 6 month , 11 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Background/Rationale : Coronary heart disease ( CHD ) lead cause death United States , result 500,000 heart attack another 500,00 death per year . More 80 % veteran &gt; 2 risk factor CHD , underscore need intervention . One major modifiable risk factor CHD elevate low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) . Despite proven success diet , exercise , medication , LDL-C frequently optimum level , due part patient nonadherence . Therefore , intervention need increase adherence , thereby lower LDL-C . Objectives : Objectives : We examine effect patient-spouse intervention lower LDL-C increase patient treatment adherence . The primary hypothesis patient enrol telephone-based , spouse-assisted intervention experience clinically meaningful 7 % reduction LDL-C . The secondary hypothesis patient receive intervention would show significant increase adherence medication , diet , exercise . Methods : In 3-year study , randomize control trial compare 10-month , telephone-based , spouse-assisted intervention usual care . Married patient above-goal LDL-C spouse consent , complete baseline assessment , randomly assign intervention usual care arm . Month 1 involved educational call deliver patient spouse . Months 2-10 ( except month 6 ) involve monthly goal set call deliver patient call focus increase social support spouse . The patient phone call always precede spouse phone call . At 6 11 month , LDL-C adherence re-assessed . The primary outcome LDL-C measure three time ( baseline , 6 month , 11 month ) ; secondary outcome adherence medication , diet , exercise , also assess baseline , 6 month , 11 month . Descriptive statistic compute study variable within study arm . Mixed effect model use evaluate intervention 's effect primary secondary outcome 11 month . We also calculate intervention cost . Status : Enrollment begin Fall , 2007 complete July 2009 . Impact : Elevated LDL-C major risk factor CHD , stroke , peripheral vascular disease , common among veteran . The expected increase prevalence CHD next several decade result increase burden veteran VA health care system . Despite know risk hypercholesterolemia , many veteran suboptimal LDL-C level . As late evidence recommendation suggest goal even low , intervention assist patient low LDL-C increasingly need . The VA considers reduction LDL-C important goal , indicate major effort Ischemic Heart Disease Quality Enhancement Research Initiatives ( QUERI ) . This study important ( 1 ) address highly prevalent risk factor CHD among veteran ; ( 2 ) propose potentially low-cost method improve LDL-C level , turn could reduce VA healthcare cost ; ( 3 ) intervention practical could disseminate easily VA healthcare system proven effective ; ( 4 ) intervention provide model self-management chronic disease , diabetes hypertension .</detailed_description>
