	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Drugs , goserelin bicalutamide , may stop adrenal gland make androgen . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Bevacizumab may also make tumor cell sensitive radiation therapy . Giving bevacizumab together hormone therapy radiation therapy may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give bevacizumab together hormone therapy radiation therapy work treat patient high-risk locally advanced prostate cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine safety efficacy give bevacizumab together hormonal therapy radiotherapy patient high-risk locally advanced prostate cancer . OUTLINE : This open-label , pilot study . Beginning week 1 , patient receive goserelin subcutaneously every 3 month 2 year . Patients also receive oral bicalutamide daily bevacizumab IV 30- 90-minutes every 2 week week 1-16 undergo radiotherapy 5 day week week 9-16 . After completion radiotherapy , patient receive high dose bevacizumab every 3 week week 17-28 . After completion study treatment , patient evaluate 30 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 18 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
