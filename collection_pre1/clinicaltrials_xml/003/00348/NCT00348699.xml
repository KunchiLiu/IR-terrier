	<brief_title>AFP464 Treating Patients With Metastatic Refractory Solid Tumors That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) AFP464 patient advance solid tumor . II . Evaluate toxicity profile AFP464 . III . Characterize plasma pharmacokinetics urinary excretion AFP464 aminoflavone patient . IV . Identify activity AFP464 patient metastatic cancer . V. Explore whether AFP464 induce cytochrome p450 , family 1 , member A1 ( CYP1A1 ) expression tumor ( patient enrol MTD ) ( patient enrol MTD ) and/or circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) ( dose-escalation phase MTD ) . VI . To explore relationship pharmacogenetic analysis toxicity response . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive AFP464 intravenously ( IV ) 3 hour day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 month .</detailed_description>
