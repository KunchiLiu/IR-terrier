	<brief_title>Pilot Study Neurovision Improve Vision Slow Myopia Progression Children With Myopia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NeuroVision 's NVC vision correction technology non-invasive , patient-specific computerize treatment base visual stimulation facilitation neural connection responsible vision . NeuroVision 's Neural Vision Correction TM ( NVC ) technology develop research focus solely optimize performance neural `` back end '' visual system , base two decade visual neuroscience research founder , Dr Uri Polat , whose work , publish lead scientific journal , relate understand brain process visual information , neural activity relate visual perception , visual processing interact neural system . The technology clinically proven treatment adult amblyopia , consider untreatable , RCT follow-up 2 year shows good retention visual improvement . The company receive FDA 510 ( k ) marketing clearance indicate NVC treatment adult amblyopia patient 9 year old US . The company also receive Medical CE-Mark market Amblyopia Low-Myopia product European Union . Company product also approve use Israel Israeli Ministry Health - Device License Authority . Additional proof-of-concept study perform Israel Singapore indicate technology 's potential improve vision subject low myopia . Today , NeuroVision commercially offer Low Myopia treatment Singapore . Initial result commercial treatment even well proof-of-concept study , emphasize importance patient motivation compliance treatment . Based promising result Low Myopia treatment adult , study intend evaluate efficacy NVC treatment myopic child , improve quality vision reduce progress rate Myopia . The first objective study evaluate improvement visual acuity child under-corrected . As myopia increase rapidly many child , habitual eyewear match exact degree myopia day day basis . As result , many child suffer reduce quality vision ( show also data Singapore Cohort Study Risk Factors Myopia [ SCORM ] study ) . Therefore , first goal study evaluate effectiveness NeuroVision treatment improvement under-corrected visual acuity child . The second objective evaluate effectiveness NeuroVision treatment reduction myopia progression rate child . As detailed later document , study animals show under-correcting myopia reduce progression rate ( even result emmetropization ) . Therefore , second goal study evaluate possibility significantly under-correcting myopia child undergone NeuroVision treatment , check affect progression myopia . To achieve objective , large scale ( hundred subject ) clinical study school child , require . This pilot study design examine feasibility large scale study , clinical , administrative logistic point view . Treatment flow process The treatment flow compose follow phase 1 . Screening Enrollment The Screening Evaluation phase include follow step : 1 . Demographic detail 2 . General medical history 3 . Baseline Examination I. Manifest Subjective Objective refraction II . Accommodation amplitude , PRA NRA III . Distance visual acuity ( Monocular binocular Under-corrected Visual Acuity , Best Corrected Visual Acuity - BCVA ) IV . Cycloplegic Objective Subjective refraction V. Distance cycloplegic under-corrected visual acuity . VI . Ocular axial length measurement For detailed description examination , refer Appendices A-B . After completion require examination , subject 's data review study investigator make final enrolment decision . Before start computerized evaluation , subject undergo additional Distance Visual Acuity Contrast Sensitivity examinations school . The result additional examination use baseline reference periodic examination do treatment period . Enrolled Subjects request complete QOV/QOL Questionnaire 1 ( Annex E ) treatment start 2 . NVC Computerized Evaluation The Computerized Evaluation session conduct order allow NVC system identify visual ability inefficiency thereby define individual parameter affect subject 's treatment plan . This phase comprise two ( 2 ) three ( 3 ) session . Training Glasses : NeuroVision determine power training eyeglass subject need NVC treatment start . The possible training glass 0.5DS , 1.0DS 1.5DS less subject 's full prescription . In case , training glass . In case subject might instruct train one eye part treatment session . The eye cover semi-translucent lens . The decision make NeuroVision base subject 's best refractive correction , his/her under-corrected VA computerized evaluation , report study coordinator . 3 . NVC Treatment The total number session complete treatment course define advance . It determine NVC system course treatment accord subject 's visual ability performance . Typically patient undergo 30 session phase . The subject perform average three ( 3 ) session per week . During phase visit interruption longer two ( 2 ) week aggregate permit . Periodic visual acuity contrast sensitivity examination perform every 5 treatment session school As progress make , train glass previously provide subject may replace training glass less power , entirely remove . The clinician subject inform training glass replacement advance . After complete 15 treatment session ( mid-term ) , subject request complete QOV/QOL Questionnaire 2 ( Annex F ) commence Treatment Session 16 . NOTE : WHEN VA TEST AND THE TREATMENT SESSION ARE TO BE PERFORMED AT THE SAME VISIT , PERIODIC VA TESTS SHOULD BE ALWAYS CONDUCTED BEFORE THE PERFORMANCE OF A TREATMENT SESSION ! 4 . End Treatment Decision Subject terminate treatment sequence accord end treatment criterion ( see summary study design ) Following end Treatment decision , subject schedule Post Treatment Examinations ( PTE ) within 2 week . For follow visit , visit range allow within +/- two week expect date 5 . Post Treatment Examination ( PTE ) The Post Treatment Examination SERI include visual acuity test , amplitude accommodation , relative accommodation , cover test , cycloplegic refraction distance under-corrected visual acuity axial length measurement . Subjects request complete QOV/QOL Questionnaire 2 ( Annex F ) 6 . Prescription under-corrected eyewear After end treatment , subject prescribe under-corrected eyewear . The under-corrected eyewear low possible refractive correction subject least 6/12 ( 0.3 LogMAR ) binocular VA . The subject instruct use new eyewear instead current one ( ) least 12 month monitoring period . 7 . Follow-Up Examinations Months 3 , 6 , 9 12 Follow-Up Examinations Months 3 , 6 , 9 12 post treatment SERI include visual acuity test , amplitude accommodation , relative accommodation , cover test , cycloplegic refraction distance under-corrected visual acuity . In case subject 's binocular VA under-corrected eyewear bad 6/12 ( 0.3 LogMAR ) 2 consecutive follow-up visit , new eyewear prescribe allow least 6/12 binocular VA. At Follow Month 6 12 , subject request complete QOV/QOL Questionnaire 2 ( Annex F ) . ''</detailed_description>
