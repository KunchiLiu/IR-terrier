Long term hair removal via electrolysis generally unsatisfactory due time consuming , painful nature associate risk scar pigmentary change . Moreover , efficacy electrolysis user dependent estimate reduction 15-50 % unwanted hair3 . The modern approach long term hair removal involve laser Intense Pulsed Light ( IPL ) treatment modality . These technology base scientific principle selective photothermolysis . During treatment , light energy absorb hair ’ pigment ( melanin ) transmit hair shaft follicle . Conversion energy heat cause rise hair temperature , lead destruction follicle disruption hair growth mechanism , leave skin undamaged . Both laser light device proven successful induce permanent hair removal , well delay hair growth , cause minimal discomfort complication . The light device base IPL technology , differs laser light various physical aspect . The main difference laser emit light distinct wavelength , IPL delivers wide range wavelength ( 400 1400 nm ) , thus allow great flexibility aspect body area , hair color skin type LEORTEC LTD. develop innovative device integrates two treatment modality : Laser Intense Pulse Light ( IPL ) addition MLS - Multi Light Source- combination two modality .
