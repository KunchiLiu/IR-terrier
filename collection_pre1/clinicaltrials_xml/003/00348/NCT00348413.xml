	<brief_summary>This project compare efficacy safety 2 method disease modification treatment active moderate severe thyroid orbitopathy . A prospective , randomize , double-blind , parallel , control multidisciplinary clinical trial involve Singapore National Eye Centre , National University Hospital , Changi General Hospital , Tan Tock Seng Hospital University British Columbia Orbital Services , Singapore Eye Research Institute , Singapore General Hospital Endocrinology Radiology Departments Tan Tock Seng Hospital Rheumatology Department plan . The SingHealth-SGH High Field MR Research Laboratory involve MR image trial patient . Patients satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion ask participate trial . After informed consent ( Appendix B ) obtain , patient randomize one two treatment arm : 1 ) Intravenous high-dose pulse methylprednisolone ( 1 gram infusion 1 hour per day total 3 dos 3 day ; 4 cycle 6 weekly interval ) oral placebo 2 ) Intravenous high-dose pulse methylprednisolone ( dose ) plus oral methotrexate 7.5 mg per week 2 week , increase 10 mg per week another 2 week 12.5 mg per week 5 month ( total 6 month methotrexate treatment ) . Depending patient response , dose increase 2.5mg per week every 4 week maximum 20 mg per week . A strict management protocol observe recruited patient . Patients develop adverse side effect need surgical intervention receive appropriate treatment ( i.e . treatment deviate protocol continue monitor ) . Patients refuse treatment observe clinically imaging natural control group time intervention accept . The patient baseline assessment follow regular visit assess treatment response adverse effect . Observations include use inflammatory index , motility measurement include quantitative ductions , exophthalmometry reading , palpebral aperture reading index optic nerve function . With regard image , patient assess initial quantitative CT scan 3-Tesla MRI scan prior treatment . After treatment start , patient also undergo repeat MRI scan 24 week 72 week assess quantitative change treatment use Muscle Diameter Index ( MDI ) Pixel Value Ratio ( PVR ) inferior rectus , superior rectus , medial rectus , lateral rectus orbital fat ( Appendix E ) . Serum urine obtain time interval MRI scan ass level thyroid hormone , thyroid antibody urinary glycosaminoglycans ( GAGs ) . Free T4 , free T3 TSH record monitor control hyperthyroidism . Thyroid antibody measure include thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin ( TSI ) , thyrotropin-binding inhibition antibody ( TB II ) , thyroid peroxidase antibody thyroglobulin antibody . Other test include full blood count , urea electrolyte run prior dose steroid treatment follow-up monitor adverse effect . The result assessment analyzed significant difference treatment response 2 group . The indices interest include percentage patient group demonstrate decrease inflammatory index least 2 point time take 50 % patient show decrease . Other parameter reflect visual function motility compare different point time start treatment observe response sustainability response . From serial MRI scan , quantitative analysis orbital tissue do identify change treatment . Antibody GAG level analyze detect change treatment . The type frequency adverse side effect 2 group also assess . 80 normal subject recruit MRI scan orbit brain obtain normative value MDI PVR Asian population ( Appendix E ) . This include 20 subject 4 decade ( 21-30 year , 31-40 year , 41-50 year , 51-60 year ) . The normative data also use create virtual orbital atlas .

	<detailed_description>Since 1835 Graves first describe eye change thyroid disease , considerable literature investigate basic disease process , clinical behaviour , natural history various medical surgical treatment thyroid orbitopathy develop . 3.1 Pathogenesis 11 , 12 HLA-DR histocompatibility loci play role T-cell response associate thyroid orbitopathy specific gene identify yet . It believe TSH receptor may autoantigen Graves ' hyperthyroidism , orbitopathy pretibial myxoedema . Somehow , T-lymphocytes activate proceed infiltrate orbital soft tissue . This set cytokine release together oxygen free radical fibrogenic growth factor lead increase hydrophilic glycosaminoglycan ( GAG ) synthesis pre-adipocyte transformation . The overall effect increase orbital muscle fat volume inflammatory oedema ultimately may result muscle fibrosis optic nerve compression . 3.2 Pathology The histopathological feature correlate immunogenetic theory thyroid orbitopathy . The extraocular muscle infiltrate lymphocyte , macrophage , plasma cell mast cell . Hydrophilic mucopolysaccharide deposit see separate muscle bundle fibre . In late stage , fibrosis muscle degeneration fat replacement note . 3.3 Clinical Features Based literature review experience University Columbia Orbital Clinic saw 2000 case 1976 2002 . 1 . Indices disease activity ( largely subjective ) - Acuity onset progression - Acute ( within week ) subacute ( 3 month 3 month ) chronic onset ( 3 month ) - Slow rapid development ( progression ) - Subjective symptom - Spontaneous retrobulbar pain - Pain extraocular movement - Soft tissue feature - Swelling , injection chemosis note patient - Patient assessment symptom sign - Same , good bad 2 . Indices disease severity extent ( largely objective ) - Lid conjunctival swell - Extraocular muscle function - Proptosis - Optic nerve function - Imaging change orbital tissue The NOSPECS classification thyroid orbitopathy 13,14 give clear picture disease activity severity . It guide prognostication management thus abandon favour assessment look specifically index allow one judge whether disease active severe 1 . From assessment , treatment algorithm formulate : 3.4 Current Treatment Although exact aetiology pathophysiology thyroid orbitopathy remain unclear , know disease suggest autoimmune mechanism work 1,2 . The initial phase disease mark clinical inflammatory change follow quiescence cicatricial persistent orbital volume change pronounce . In latter phase , surgery alone work alleviate symptom . To avoid end-stage development , disease treat active stage . A recent trend management thyroid orbitopathy treat active disease intravenous pulse methylprednisolone 1,3-8 . This step away oral steroid arise desire avoid many know complication prolong oral steroid use well perceive low success rate use oral steroid . Marcocci et al 9 publish August 2001 result prospective , single-blind , randomize study compare effectiveness tolerability intravenous oral glucocorticoid association orbital radiotherapy treatment severe Graves ' ophthalmopathy . This study find treatment effective ( 60-85 % show improvement ) intravenous route associate low rate side effect . 3,4,5,6,7,9 Another treatment report Smith Rosenbaum British Journal Ophthalmology 10 . They describe use oral methotrexate management non-infectious orbital inflammatory disease . In study , 3 patient recalcitrant thyroid orbitopathy previously treat oral prednisolone , irradiation surgical decompression . Two still oral prednisolone oral methotrexate start . All 3 show clinical benefit 2 also steroid initially eventually able cease steroid use . The good response may well due fact methotrexate , T-cell inhibit effect , succeed halt disease process especially use together corticosteroid . The current treatment progressively bad moderate severe disease medical decompression either corticosteroid without cyclosporin immunosuppressive agent methotrexate , cyclophosphamide azathioprine adjuvant therapy . The use latter agent well study . When soft tissue inflammation orbital congestion relieve , surgical redress mechanical problem follow . The role radiotherapy remain unclear 15 . Gorman et al conducted prospective , randomized double-blind , placebo-controlled study orbital radiotherapy Graves ' ophthalmopathy fail demonstrate beneficial therapeutic effect 16 . However , study flaw broad patient inclusion criterion initiation radiotherapy different stage disease . Other study report effective use radiotherapy treatment Graves ' ophthalmopathy . Mourits conduct randomized placebo-controlled trial show external beam irradiation produce improvement ocular motility patient mild moderate disease 17 . We propose active moderate severe thyroid orbitopathy treat aggressively intravenous pulse methylprednisolone oral methotrexate order well stabilise disease process prevent cicatricial compressive event . The question study aim answer whether good treatment option compare current treatment term efficacy safety . Assessing antibody urinary GAG level yield information serum urinary profile treatment . We previously report association thyroid autoantibody ophthalmopathy 18 . The study also use 3-Tesla MRI obtain normative value ( MDI PVR ) Asian population evaluate quantitative change thyroid-related orbitopathy . This provide framework study multimodality therapy , include T-cell suppression , specific immunoglobulins antifibroblastic agent . 4 . STUDY PURPOSE The purpose study investigate effectiveness safety combine intravenous steroid oral methotrexate treatment patient active moderate severe thyroid orbitopathy . A prospective , randomize , double-blind , parallel , control clinical trial design aim provide useful information aid future multimodality trial . This concept base trend manage rheumatologic disorder early aggressive target multimodality therapy improve treatment . The result study also complement plan radiotherapy study University British Columbia</detailed_description>
