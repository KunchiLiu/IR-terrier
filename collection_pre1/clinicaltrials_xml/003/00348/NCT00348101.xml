However , β-blocker therapy remain underutilized clinical practice concern potential adverse effect reduce inotropic state , might result acute congestive heart failure hypotension . Therefore , additional treatment positive inotropic agent might need . Phosphodiesterase inhibitor ( PDEIs ) offer favourable pharmacological profile set stimulate cardiac function absence β-adrenergic receptor .

	<detailed_description>Cardiac complication , , myocardial infarction , heart failure , life-threatening dysrhythmias , lead cause perioperative death among patient undergo major vascular surgery . The pathogenesis perioperative ischaemic event certainly multifactorial include persistent activation several neurohormonal pathway , natriuretic peptide system . Previous clinical investigation demonstrate utility β-adrenergic blockade reduce perioperative ischaemic event , ultimately translate decrease cardiac morbidity mortality especially patient high risk coronary artery disease . Therefore , administration β-blockers patient high risk coronary event schedule undergo major noncardiac surgery strongly support consensus recommendation clinical guideline . Despite evidence benefit , β-blockers remain underutilized clinical practice concern potential adverse effect reduce inotropic state , might result myocardial depression , acute congestive heart failure , hypotension [ 13 ] . Therefore , additional treatment positive inotropic agent might need . Phosphodiesterase inhibitor ( PDEIs ) offer favourable pharmacological profile set retain haemodynamic effect face full β-blockade . Preliminary data suggest combination PDEI β-blocker therapy may better tolerate allows expression know effect β-blocker therapy improve myocardial functioning without adverse effect either therapy alone . We therefore hypothesize combination PDEI β-blocker therapy would decrease perioperative plasma concentration brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) patient require major vascular surgery document high prevalence coronary artery disease limit coronary reserve . BNP choose pivotal role sensitive correlate myocardial dysfunction prognostic value predict short- long-term risk cardiac death across entire spectrum acute coronary syndrome .</detailed_description>
