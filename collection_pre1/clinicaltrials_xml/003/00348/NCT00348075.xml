	<brief_title>A Singapore Study Assess How Neurovision Improve Vision Adults With Low Moderate Myopia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NeuroVision develop novel vision correction technology , scientifically base treatment improve vision base new principle visual psychophysics . NeuroVision NVC Vision Correction Technology non-invasive , patient-specific treatment base visual stimulation facilitation neural connection responsible vision . The treatment involve programmed series interactive visual exercise front computer , involve form prescription medication , surgical treatment . The technology proven Israel Singapore 's pilot study work myopia -1.50D . This study clinical trial Singapore Ministry Defence personnel evaluate efficacy treatment beyond proven myopia range . There 2 phase study ; Phase 1 include low myope -0.50D -1.50D Phase 2 cover moderate myope -1.75D -3.00D . Subjects randomise treatment placebo group ratio 3:1 . A randomized double mask control trial conduct 2 Phases : Phase I involve 140 study subject low myopia randomize 3:1 randomization receive NVC treatment versus placebo treatment . It assume withdrawal rate exceed 20 % , least 112 study subject complete treatment phase . Interim analysis stop rule conduct 3/4 patient complete treatment phase . Phase II involve 180 study subject moderate myopia randomize 3:1 randomization receive NVC treatment versus placebo treatment . The 2 phase separate RCTs , recruitment Phase II subject subsequent completion Phase I NVC treatment .</detailed_description>
