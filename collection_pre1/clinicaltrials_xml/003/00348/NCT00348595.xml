	<brief_summary>The primary objective study : - To evaluate feasibility , safety tolerance 6 month administration Revlimid 5mg/day 25mg/day , give orally subject prostate cancer evidence biochemical relapse ( M0 ) follow local treatment ( i.e. , surgery radiation ) . - To assess rate PSA ( prostatic specific antigen ) progression 6 month treatment 5mg/day 25mg/day Revlimid ( CC-5013 ) patient evidence biochemical relapse local therapy . The secondary objective study : - To provide preliminary assessment effect Revlimid ( CC-5013 ) 5mg/day 25mg/day various PSA construct subject population ( i.e. , PSADT [ Prostatic Specific Antigen Doubling Time ] PSA slope ) compare pre post treatment pattern arm . - To evaluate preliminary pharmacodynamic correlation serum revlimid concentration toxicity , PSA construct evidence disease progression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study 2 Different Doses Revlimid Biochemically Relapse Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Carcinoma prostate commonly diagnose malignancy among men country approximately 232,090 new case expect diagnosed 2005 . Unfortunately , despite local treatment , many men demonstrate evidence PSA recurrence . At present time , standard treatment fo patient . The management patient PSA recurrence remain greatly controversial . Androgen deprivation frequently employ patient evidence rise PSA level despite fact effect quantity quality life androgen deprivation therapy stage , remain un-established . Toxicity androgen deprivation therapy major factor consider decision process employ modality treatment patient symptoms associated disease . Because patient biochemical relapse mostly asymptomatic typically long survival disease free survival , mush focus new drug development use non-cytotoxic compound . This study intend provide preliminary evidence biological effect dose response manner assess effect Revlimid ( CC-5013 ) PSA .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm diagnosis adenocarcinoma prostate ( M0 ) evidence biochemical relapse local therapy ( i.e. , surgery , radiation therapy , . ) Baseline PSA must great equal 1 ng/ml . Confirmed rise PSA show 2 PSA value least 1 month apart , high reference value note within 6 month study entry . Interim PSA value immediate prestudy sixmonth interval may demonstrate `` fluctuation '' include decline , however study baseline PSA must show rise within prestudy 6months period . Baseline PSA 's must determine within 4 week study entry . All previous local modality treatment , include radiation surgery , must discontinue least 4 week prior treatment study . May receive prior systemic chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , biologic vaccine therapy . All treatment must discontinue 6 month prior study entry . Patients receive intermittent hormonal therapy rise PSA state consider eligible testosterone level 150 ng/dl treatment discontinue great 6 month No clinical radiological evidence distant metastasis ( exclude prostascint scan ) . Serum testosterone &gt; 150 ng/ml Disease free prior malignancy 5 year exception currently treat basal cell , squamous cell carcinoma skin , carcinoma `` situ '' breast . Able take aspirin ( ASA 81 325 mg ) daily prophylactic anticoagulation ( patient intolerant ASA may use low molecular weight heparin ) . Lenalidomide increase risk thrombotic event patient high risk history thrombosis , particular combine drug know cause thrombosis . Any serious medical condition , laboratory abnormality , psychiatric illness would prevent subject signing informed consent form . Any condition , include presence laboratory abnormality , place subject unacceptable risk he/she participate study confounds ability interpret data study . Known hypersensitivity thalidomide . The development erythema nodosum characterize desquamate rash take thalidomide similar drug . Any prior use RevlimidÂ® ( CC5013 ) . Concurrent use anticancer agent treatment . Known brain metastasis . Known positive HIV infectious hepatitis , type A , B C. Any evidence metastatic disease . Any increase PSA receive neoadjuvant adjuvant therapy intermittent hormonal therapy . More one prior biologic vaccine therapy</criteria>
