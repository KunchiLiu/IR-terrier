	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Effectiveness Safety Extended Release Tramadol HCl 100 mg , 200 mg 300 mg Doses Placebo Treatment Moderate Severe Pain Due Osteoarthritis ( OA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Immediate release ( IR ) tramadol demonstrate efficacy several pain condition include , obstetrical , gynecological , orthopedic , abdominal , oral surgery . The short elimination half-life IR tramadol necessitates every 4-6 hour dose maintain optimum level analgesia chronic pain . The study medication study once-daily , extend release ( ER ) tramadol formulation . This 12-week multicenter , double-blind , randomize , dose-ranging , placebo positive-controlled , parallel-group study . For purpose study , celecoxib serf positive control validate sensitivity model . Patients OA functional Class I-III knee hip , moderate severe pain eligible participation , appropriate criterion meet . During 2-7 day washout period , use analgesic medication discontinue . Eligible patient experience moderate severe pain ( &gt; = 40 mm 100 mm visual analog scale ) index joint evaluate meet study criterion enter double-blind titration period . During period , patient randomly assign receive treatment tramadol HCl ER 100 mg , 200 mg , 300 mg , celecoxib 200 mg placebo , daily . During titration period ( Days 1-9 ) patient contact phone every day ensure experience unmanageable pain unacceptable side effect . Efficacy safety evaluation collect study visit occur Weeks 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 9 12 time early termination . Study medication discontinue Week 12 patient return 1 week post-treatment visit ( Week 13 ) .</detailed_description>
