	<brief_title>EVENT : Hydrotherapy Deep Venous Thrombosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Venous thrombo-embolic disease ( VTED ) frequent pathology . The incidence 5 20 case 10000 person year , general population . The immediate risk pulmonary embolism potentially fatal . So , justifies work clinical research last year . Those study allow many progress , diagnostic therapeutic , immediate undertaking patient . Despite , VTED major problem public health diminution mortality lie VTED one objectives French law relative politics Public Health ( August 2004 ) . At long-term , post-thrombotic syndrome lead incapacitate pathology , require many care . The frequency post-thrombotic syndrome evaluate 25 60 % middle-term ( 1 2 year ) . It depend study clinical primary end-points vascular exploration . Rehabilitation never validate indication study correct methodology . Deep venous thrombosis ( acute phase ) recognize indication 10 spa France . But specific global benefit water cure clearly scientifically prove . The importance venous pump calf hydrostatic pressure physiopathology post-thrombotic syndrome make natural use balneotherapy prevention pathology patient severe deep venous thrombosis lower limb ( proximal obstruent ) . The venous thermal technique well-defined physiopathological target . The haemodynamic microcirculatory effect prove . The high degree satisfaction patient benefit phlebological water cure every year France indirectly show benefit feel . In indication , prevention post-thrombotic syndrome one well-recognize medical profession . For , really validation indication acceptable methodology canon modern medicine . That reason undertake randomize , single-blind control study main objective demonstrate hydrotherapy specific place reduce risk post-thrombotic syndrome .</detailed_description>
