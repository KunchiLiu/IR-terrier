	<brief_title>A Singapore Pilot Study Assess Neurovision Treatment Low Myopia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The eye care industry focus majority resource solve problem associate ocular `` front end '' visual system . These investment lead excite technology advance , intraocular lens ( IOLs ) Laser Vision Correction ( LVC ) well development contact lenses improved eyewear . NeuroVision 's innovative Neural Vision Correction ( NVC ) technology develop research focus solely optimize performance neural `` back end '' visual system . NeuroVision 's technology distinguish product space Company 's expert understanding brain process vision , reliance scientific clinical research It result two decade research Dr. Uri Polat , founder , dedicate 20 year scientific clinical research understand brain process visual information , neural activity relate visual perception , visual processing interact neural system . His work publish lead scientific journal widely cite scientific community . NeuroVision 's NVC vision correction technology non-invasive , patient-specific treatment base visual stimulation facilitation neural connection responsible vision . The technology clinically proven treatment adult amblyopia ( `` lazy eye '' ) , consider untreatable . The Company receive FDA 510 ( k ) marketing clearance indicate NVC treatment adult amblyopia patient 9 year old US . The Company also receive Medical CE-Mark market Amblyopia Low-Myopia product EU . Company product also approve use Israel Israeli Ministry Health - Device License Authority . This study prospective non-controlled preliminary clinical study prelude randomize clinical trial , evaluate efficacy safety NeuroVision NVC correction technology improve visual acuity contrast sensitivity function .</detailed_description>
