	<brief_summary>This study look effect high spinal anesthesia ( also know total spinal anesthesia ) combine general anesthesia versus general anesthesia alone follow : Stress response : Patients undergo aortic valve replacement surgery large incision complex operation must place heart-lung machine . The body react heart-lung machine , increase stress response . High spinal anesthesia use local anesthetic combine general anesthesia show block stress response surgery response heart-lung machine . This study examine blood level stress hormone also inflammatory mediator lower use high spinal anesthesia . Heart function : High spinal anesthesia combination general anesthesia may help heart work well narrow valve ( aortic stenosis ) . The heart may also improve ability pump blood anesthetic technique . Lung function post-operative pain control : After surgery , patient often pain prevents take deep breath cough . This lead pneumonia . This study also examine post-operative pain relief provide spinal morphine ( give together spinal anesthetic ) provide good pain control follow surgery . By , want see patient take big breath surgery spinal morphine use , try prevent complication occur patient able breath deeply surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It hypothesize high spinal anesthesia combine general anesthesia decrease intraoperative stress inflammatory response improve post-operative pain control respiratory function patient population . It also hypothesize technique provide stable intraoperative hemodynamics aortic valve replacement surgery . Stress response : Levels hormone epinephrine , norepinephrine cortisol elevate cardiac surgery initiation cardiopulmonary bypass . This stress response previously show blunt use high spinal anesthesia combine general anesthesia coronary artery bypass surgery patient ( Lee , Grocott , et al ) . Inflammatory response : In addition stress response also accentuate inflammatory response . With contact patient 's blood artificial bypass circuit , activation various plasma protease pathway generate multiple proinflammatory mediator . Complement level cytokine level also rise . Clinical organ dysfunction involve cardiovascular , pulmonary , renal neurological system ultimately result . The effect high spinal anesthesia inflammatory response occur bypass study . Hemodynamics : It previously show high-spinal anesthesia coronary artery bypass surgery provide stable intra-operative hemodynamics ( Kowalewski , MacAdams , et al ; Lee , Grocott , et al. ) . Although use spinal anesthesia patient aortic stenosis consider relatively contra-indicated , total spinal anesthesia may actually improve cardiac function decrease systemic afterload increase myocardial contractility . Post-operative analgesia pulmonary function : The spinal administration opioids , morphine , show improve post-operative pain management patient cardiac non-cardiac surgery ( Jacobsohn , Lee , et al ) . Total spinal anesthesia bupivacaine spinal morphine combine general anesthesia may also improve post-operative pain management facilitate improve post-operative lung function .</detailed_description>
