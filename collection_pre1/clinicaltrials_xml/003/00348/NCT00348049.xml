	<brief_summary>Laser situ keratomileusis ( LASIK ) photorefractive keratectomy ( PRK ) currently 2 main refractive surgery correct myopia perform worldwide , patient prefer LASIK PRK good comfort faster rehabilitation . However , post-LASIK patient , low risk flap dislodgement . This risk increase certain occupation high risk trauma . Hence , may role PRK people occupation , e.g . soldier , parachutist , sportsman . There several non-randomised study show PRK efficacious , predictable safe LASIK low moderate myope . But randomize control study compare efficacy safety 2 treatment modality study compare LASIK PRK suffer high dropout rate follow-up period . We compare efficacy , predictability , stability safety LASIK versus PRK one year duration almost 100 % attendance follow-up visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy LASIK Versus PRK Asians With Mild Moderate Myopia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective , randomize , clinical trial compare efficacy , predictability , stability safety LASIK versus PRK volunteer group myopic military serviceman recruit Singapore Armed Forces . 132 subject eligible study randomize undergo either LASIK PRK eye 2:1 ratio . 45 subject ( 90 eye ) underwent PRK 87 subject ( 174 eye ) underwent LASIK . An additional 59 subject underwent non-randomised arm study underwent PRK .</detailed_description>
