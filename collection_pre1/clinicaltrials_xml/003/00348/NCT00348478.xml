	<brief_summary>There specific trial address benefit water provision health education prevalence trachoma infection ocular Chlamydia trachomatis time , despite considerable effort provide water resource trachoma endemic area . Such information sorely need , advance Global Alliance agenda Elimination Blinding Trachoma . This community-based clinical trial randomize ten community Maradi Niger , half receive delivery water health education service , half delivery service later date . We hypothesize intervention community low rate trachoma C. trachomatis one two year delivery service compare community without service . This trial provide , first time , solid evidence effect service trachoma , well added benefit follow antibiotic provision Ministry Health sustain reduction trachoma infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives This study follow objective : 1 . To determine effect clinical trachoma cohort child baseline one , two , three year post-intervention village-based water health education program . 2 . To determine effect ocular C. trachomatis infection cohort child baseline one , two , three year post-intervention village-based water health education program . 3 . A secondary outcome measure five year mortality intervention compare control Study Design : Population : We propose evaluate trachoma time sample child age 1-5 year baseline village Niger World Vision plan immediate water health education service delivery , compare sample child village service implement two year . Services : World Vision plan water well serve population 300 , village 300-5,000 person . Thus village around 1-17 well . The goal provide water within 500 meter wait time le 15 minute . Health education use water hygiene practice also part service delivery . A World Vision Area Development Program officer establish train water sanitation committee provide health education village . Villages randomly select part service classify `` intervention '' village . In addition , village plan process start well would drill two year . Villages randomly select group service available immediately , classify `` control '' village . Design : Overview The design three-year longitudinal study trachoma infection ocular Chlamydia trachomatis cohort child age 1-5 baseline . From list village Maradi region intend water program within next three year , randomly select six village `` intervention '' village six village `` control '' village . We aim include 360 child , randomly select 6 `` intervention '' village ( one per mother total 60 village ) 360 child randomly select 6 `` control '' village . Surveys trachoma infection carry baseline , one , two , three year baseline . Details describe . Villages The 1995 census Maradi basis select village Kornaka West district Maradi , Niger , World Vision plan intervention . The village study comparable size ( 900-2,100 [ estimate ] person ) , village size may important predictor trachoma status 12 month . The village select follow : 1 . A list village estimate population 900 2,100 district Kornaka West generate . The total number village 18 2 . The Area Development Program ( ADP ) geographic area stratify control village would within 5 KM village village well . 3 . Each village assign sequential number table random number . The six village low number assign `` left '' stratum select `` intervention '' village , six village low number `` right '' strata select `` control '' village . Four additional village next low number select reserve village , case need village refuse survey . This selection process mean World Vision plan work first six village designate `` intervention village '' , well health education program within first year . World Vision implement water health education program `` control '' village two year . The rest villages select either intervention control program implement decide World Vision suit need understanding well implement village within 5 KM control villages two year . The reserve village release need soon census complete . Census Once village select , team train census-takers three thing : gather minimal data village , minimal data compound `` concession '' , complete census everyone concession . Every concession must census provide accurate count number person number child age 1-5 year old . The senior census taker follow : - Explain study village leadership understand ask village resident . - Explain child survey sample find trachoma treated topical tetracycline survey . However , every child every household part survey antibiotic restrict survey child . However , mass treatment community everyone treat planned government end two year . - Secure permission village leadership conduct village survey , concession survey , trachoma survey sample child age 1-5 year . - Collect village information - Identify person village lead census team concession village information concession census . - Supervise team census taker carry census village . - Certify households/concessions village census form end village census The census taker responsible collect concession information complete census every concession/household village . - Collect data concession chef concession , observation , `` Questionniare Chef du Concession '' - Collect information everyone Selection Sample Children Once census concession complete , random sample 60 child age 1 5 year 5 month village select . A stratified random sample strategy develop limit selection one child per mother , preference 0 1 child age 1 5 5/12 month total 60 per village . This strategy minimize cluster child within household , possible simple random sample use . Survey Trachoma Baseline survey trachoma sample child age 1-5 5/12 year take place prior water health education intervention . The survey consist follow step : 1 . Prior survey village , member team alert village leadership survey team come , household survey , make sure sample child stay village day survey . 2 . The day survey , mother ask bring sample child survey site close , examination . As come , consent obtain senior trachoma grader , name check list , form single specimen label fill examiner laboratory technician . 3 . The trachoma grader evert eyelid . He must change glove child , even child house , even child appear trachoma . The trachoma grader , wear 2.5X loupe , assess trachoma status tarsal plate , use WHO Simplified grade scheme . 4 . While leave eyelid still evert , laboratory technician , follow careful procedure describe train manual , roll swab three time across tarsal plate obtain specimen . 5 . If child TF TI , mother give tube tetracycline instruction proper use child . 6 . At end day field , specimen transfer freezer World Vision Maradi , await return freezer Niamey . During drive Niamey , specimens must keep frozen well , ice pack . By 6 month first year , water health education program `` intervention '' village underway , well complete . This assure least 6 month exposure intervention next survey one year . The sample child survey trachoma one , two , three year . No additional child add sample replace died move away . The procedure follow survey exactly baseline survey . Mass Treatment provide Ministry health Second Year Survey ; control villages receive water sanitation program time . The `` intervention village '' continue water sanitation , undergo mass treatment two year survey . The `` control village , implementation water health education plan implementation second year survey , also receive mass treatment azithromycin . For third year , compare prevalence trachoma three year water health education plus mass treatment , mass treatment plus short exposure water health education . At time survey , complete census list child age five updated new child add , child decease previous year . These data use determine five mortality village previous year . A comparison five year mortality intervention control villages do end three year survey . Comparison trachoma ocular C. trachomatis infection sentinel child resident intervention village compare sentinel child resident control villages one two year post baseline do . A secondary comparison determine five year mortality two three year post baseline intervention versus control village .</detailed_description>
