	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Vatalanib may stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor block enzyme need cell growth . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well vatalanib work treat patient recurrent progressive meningioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vatalanib Treating Patients With Recurrent Progressive Meningioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine efficacy vatalanib , term radiographic improvement clinical improvement , patient recurrent progressive meningioma . Secondary - Determine 6-month progression-free survival patient . - Describe response rate overall survival patient . - Determine safety vatalanib patient . - Correlate response rate expression vascular endothelial growth factor , epidermal growth factor receptor , platelet-derived growth factor , HER2 . - Develop exploratory data concern surrogate marker angiogenic activity vivo use magnetic resonance perfusion . OUTLINE : Patients receive oral vatalanib twice daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 25 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
