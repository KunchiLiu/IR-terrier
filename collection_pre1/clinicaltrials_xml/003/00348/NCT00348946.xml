	<brief_title>Androgen Effect Klinefelter Syndrome Motor Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Klinefelter syndrome ( KS ) , genetic disorder affect male , characterize extra X chromosome . The phenotype — physical learning feature — include testicular failure , tall stature , specific cognitive behavioral attribute diminish motor function , language-based learning difficulty , poor self-image , shyness . The KS phenotype may result androgen deficiency utero , infancy , childhood . For individual KS , androgen replacement standard treatment adolescence adulthood use earlier childhood include standard medical care KS child age 4 12 . The purpose study examine effect androgen learn development boy KS . Researchers also want determine low-dose androgen replacement early age improve learn difficulty associate disorder . The overall goal study address question regard relationship early androgen deficiency learn motor function . Participants study randomized one two treatment group , receive either oxandrolone ( low-dose androgen ) placebo , two year . All participant evaluate safety begin study 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month . Also begin study every 3 6 month thereafter ( total 6 visit ) , researcher perform careful history physical examination bone age X-ray , obtain blood sample . Participation trial last two year include 6 clinic visit .</detailed_description>
