	<brief_summary>Information study need plan eventual trial GAS vaccine India one available . A GAS vaccine currently priority Indian Council Medical Research ( ICMR ) , project approve Joint Working Group ( US Indian Delegates ) Vaccine Action Program , joint effort ICMR NIAID implement cooperative effort two country mutual objective vaccine development . Currently , several GAS vaccine development , support NIAID , source , one candidate phase one clinical trial authorize FDA . Information antigenic structure GAS isolate India need plan vaccine composition . It view Indian Ministry Health Indian Council Medical Research eventual prevention control rheumatic fever rheumatic heart disease India , heavy burden child require GAS vaccine , require access primary health care vaccine available . Information incidence need determine size future vaccine cohort order obtain statistically significant result vaccine efficacy . Although unrelated vaccine development , information incidence GAS pharyngitis need India implement primary secondary acute rheumatic fever ( ARF ) rheumatic heart disease ( RHD ) prevention program implement USA Europe forty year ago . A vaccine trial part study , intervention , antibiotic treatment child volunteer develop GAS pharyngitis impetigo . An additional point make importance obtain epidemiological data streptococcal disease India , emm type GAS cause infection . The population India one billion people , represent nearly twenty five percent world 's population . Information GAS epidemiology India scant say least , sorely need . We know streptococcal toxic shock syndrome fasciitis occur U. S. , Europe , Australia , Japan , great frequency recent year cause several genetically similar emm type GAS . The implication genetic epidemiologic data genetically related strain spread worldwide , Current information India far limit know virulent strain GAS occur India , , extent might cause frequent invasive disease hospitalize patient . Equally important , know potentially high virulent GAS strain currently emerge locale ( ) India , possible threat might become , transported worldwide geographic region . Although specific aim proposal , surveillance conduct accomplish aim protocol provide essential information possible emergence unexpected emm type pathogenic potential .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This epidemiological study incidence Group A beta hemolytic streptococcal ( GAS ) infection ( pharyngitis impetigo ) school-age child two rural area India : surveillance four school , north Punjab near Chandigarh conduct medical staff Department Community Medicine Post-graduate Institute Medical Research Training ( PGI ) ; one school south Tamil Nadu near Vellore conduct medical staff Department Community Medicine , Christian Medical College ( CMC ) . Children teacher question weekly history GAS infection . On child suspect history streptococcal infection pharynx skin , physical examination nose , throat , ears skin perform throat culture skin culture blood sample take subsequent antibody determination . The diagnosis GAS infection make basis establish clinical criterion isolation GAS throat skin lesion culture . The surveillance child complete March '04 Vellore , April '04 Chandigarh . For next year , extensive analysis clinical data ; analysis isolate GAS emm type bacteriologic characteristic ; epidemiologic analysis search pattern distribution GAS infection sex , age , school session . The general objective : To establish population-based surveillance determine incidence GAS infection school child age 7-11 , characterize M protein newly isolate strain GAS emm gene sequencing , 1. identify surrogate marker protective immunity relevant vaccine development serum antibody M type-specific peptide cysteine protease , 2. define molecular epidemiology GAS term characteristic relevant vaccine-induced immunity . Information study need plan eventual trial vaccine ( ) one available . Information antigenic structure GAS isolate India need plan vaccine composition . Information incidence need determine size future cohort need obtain statistically significant result vaccine efficacy . A vaccine trial part study , intervention , diagnostic procedure antibiotic treatment develop GAS infection .</detailed_description>
