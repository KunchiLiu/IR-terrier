	<brief_summary>This study look link corn farm practice short-term change immune function farmer throughout grow season . It examine biologic effect associate specific pesticide exposures general planting activity , tillage . Farmers increase risk non-Hodgkin lymphoma certain blood cancer multiple myeloma leukemia , reason increase identify . Findings study may contribute learn cause cancer non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Farmers enrol Agricultural Health Study ( study pesticide applicator spouses Iowa North Carolina ) group control subject select agricultural extension worker Iowa may participate study . The study involve six home visit farmer four visit farmer individual control group . All participant complete follow test procedure : - Questionnaires diary During first visit , participant medical history review , include question smoke health habit . Farmers ask farming practice , control ask occupation . Farmers fill daily diary short time period interest around certain pesticide application describe farm activity day . At time grow season harvest , farmer fill weekly diary describe farming activity ; control , meanwhile , fill weekly diary describe health work activity . At home visit farmer grow season , participant fill questionnaires health . Finally , farmer control complete extensive questionnaire off-season , last home visit , learn activity exposures final part year ( post-harvest farmer ) . - Urine sample : At time home visit , control provide urine sample interviewer take day . Farmers , , provide urine sample time home visit , also collect urine sample period 4 day short time period interest certain pesticide application . The interviewer collect sample immediately end period . - Blood sample : At time home visit , interviewer draw 50 ml ( 3.5 tablespoon ) blood . - Telephone call : Farmers call frequently every 2 week every day schedule visit time interest . Control subject also call frequently schedule visit closely farmer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Influence Corn Farming Immune System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When compare general population , farmer increase risk non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) certain hematopoeitic cancer ( i.e. , multiple myeloma , leukemia ) . Factors contribute excess risk discern . While several epidemiologic study observe increase risk NHL among farmer expose certain pesticide ( i.e. , phenoxyacetic acid , organophosphate , organochlorines , triazine ) , study conclusive . In addition , clear mechanistic association farm pesticide exposure subsequent development cancer identify . Given immunocompromised individual increase risk NHL , hypothesize alter immune function may indicator increase potential development immunologically base disease NHL . Therefore , research early immunologic effect farm exposure hold promise discerning disease mechanism identify specific etiologic agent lymphatic cancer NHL . Few study conduct . This protocol outline study immune effect among corn farmer within Agricultural Health Study ( AHS ) cohort . The main objective evaluate change immune parameter farmer throughout grow season , well effect specific pesticide exposure include atrazine organophosphate ( OP ) insecticide . Farmers control subject contact prior plant ( February-March ) enrol study . Biological sample plant application preemergent pesticide ( likely include atrazine possibly Ops carbamate ) allow examination short-term biologic effect associate specific pesticide exposures general planting activity ( e.g. , tillage ) . The first post-emergent application organophosphate insecticide also monitor , order evaluate short-term biologic effect associate OP exposture . Post-harvest off-season sample also collect allow evaluation overall immune effect farm activity . Pesticide exposure ( e.g. , atrazine , OPs , potentially 2,4-D carbamate ) assess primarily measurement parent compound metabolites urine , additional information farming activity work practice obtain questionnaire . Farmers serve self-control , select control group provide mean external comparison .</detailed_description>
