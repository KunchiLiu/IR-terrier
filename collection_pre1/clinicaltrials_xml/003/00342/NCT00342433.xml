	<brief_summary>Although compelling evidence laboratory study suggest androgen play major role prostate carcinogenesis , epidemiologic study human ( almost exclusively serologic study ) unable confirm hormonal hypothesis . The major limitation serologic study may stem difficulty measure androgenicity directly target site - prostate . If circulating hormone reflect intraprostatic hormone level androgenicity , clear interpret result serum/plasma measurement , unlikely future serologic study clarify role hormone prostate cancer etiology . This study comprehensive methodologic study design collect venous blood prostatic tissue 650 patient ( 100 Chinese , 500 American , 50 Italian ) undergo prostatic surgery ( radical prostatectomy , cystoprostatectomy , transurethral resection prostate ) order correlate prostate tissue serum hormone level , polymorphisms hormone-related gene ( include androgen receptor SRD5A2 , gene encode 5-alpha-reductase Type II ) , examine characteristic ( age , smoking , body size ) might affect serum-tissue correlation . We plan study follow hormone : testosterone , dihydrotestosterone , androstenedione , androstandediol glucuronide , estradiol , estrone , estrone sulfate . Levels androgen receptor associate protein prostatic tissue also measure provide good estimate total intraprostatic androgenicity . We also plan collect saliva 100 case Washington , D.C. area 100 case China , ass whether non-invasive tissue collection method valid hormone measurement . Finally , urine collection 100 Chinese men plan study androgen metabolite . Additionally , plan include 200 Chinese subject blood collection without tumor tissue gene polymorphism study , bring total number subject enrol 850 . For 650 subject provide prostate tissue , 30-ml fasting blood collect hormone polymorphism analysis , tissue collect surgery . A 15-minute interview conduct elicit information demographic characeristics , tobacco alcohol use , body size , medical history . The propose methodologic study first kind investigate androgenicity target tissue directly , correlation target tissue androgenicity circulating level hormone polymorphisms hormone-related gene well-designed epidemiologic study . This study provide critical information guide future analytic study hormones prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraprostatic Androgenicity Relation Circulating Levels Hormones Polymorphisms Hormone-Related Genes : A Methodologic Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although androgen ( male hormone ) central hypothesis prostate cancer etiology decade , epidemiologic study human able confirm hormonal hypothesis . Most study use sere ( blood ) examine relationship circulate hormone subsequent prostate cancer risk . However , possible circulating level hormone may reflect intraprostatic androgenic activity accurately . To gain insight provide direction future epidemiologic study , National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) conduct comprehensive methodological study call Intraprostatic androgenicity relation circulating level hormone polymorphisms hormone-related gene : methodologic study . The specific aim study : - correlate circulating level androgens estrogen tissue level ( include testosterone , DHT , DHT sulfate , androstenedione , androstanediol glucuronide , estradiol , estrone , estrone sulfate ) ; - determine whether serum-tissue correlation mediate age , race , select epidemiologic factor , smoke body size ; - determine whether tissue hormone level correlate polymorphism certain hormone-related gene , include androgen receptor ( AR ) SRD5A2 ; - correlate circulating level hormone intraprostatic androgenicity , define combined level tissue hormone , androgen receptor , associate protein ( ARA70 ) .</detailed_description>
