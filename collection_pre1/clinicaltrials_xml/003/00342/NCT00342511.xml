	<brief_summary>This study evaluate method test human papillomavirus ( HPV ) DNA . For woman Pap test result abnormal , new test do HPV , , viruses sometimes cause bumpy flat wart . Such infection usually disappear 1 2 year someone 's Pap test show mild abnormality . But HPV go away , infection slowly lead cancer cervix . Through study , researcher examine patient conjunction colposcopy , , diagnostic tool determine cause abnormal Pap test result . The researcher hope improve efficiency detect HPV reduce risk cervical cancer . Patients age 21 older pregnant hysterectomy attend colposcopy clinic may eligible study . This study enroll 150 patient . Two pilot study do : one Cleveland Clinic , use POI sampler ( Preventive Oncology International ) University Arizona , use Fournier sampler . In study part use POI sampler , patient recruit exist colposcopy schedule . For Fournier sampler , patient recruit attend schedule colposcopy visit . During procedure , doctor collect two ( Cleveland Clinic ) three ( University Arizona ) specimen patient patient sit . A speculum place vagina time . Then doctor conduct routine pelvic exam , use speculum , patient lie , perform colposcopy . One final specimen collect colposcopic evaluation . Those three four specimen use research purpose , make part different regular colposcopy exam . The pelvic exam may sometimes slightly uncomfortable , patient may temporary vaginal spotting blood afterward . The collection additional specimen may also cause slight discomfort . The research specimens , label information directly identify patient , store repository sponsor NIH . Those specimen would test future . Participants tell result test part routine management abnormal Pap result . Women participate University Arizona receive $ 25 time spend study . Benefits patient receive part study include help researcher discover new way prevent cervical cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Cytology screen program efficiently reduce cervical cancer incidence mortality U.S. &gt; 75 % . However , program rely insensitive Pap smear , consequently , inefficient overly expensive . Therefore , need undeserved population well-served current cytology-based program cervical cancer screen . Based central role oncogenic type human papillomavirus ( HPV ) cause virtually case cervical cancer , HPV DVA test already approve FDA adjunctive screening modality cytology country primary screen modality internationally . A validated screening program HPV DNA test self-collected cervicovaginal specimen might provide sensitive wider coverage screen cytology population underserved cytology-based ( Papanicolaou [ Pap ] smear liquid-based cytology ) screen program therefore elevate risk cervical cancer . We currently evaluate self-collection device optimal detection HPV DNA , include one ( POI sampler ) design Jerry Belinson ( Cleveland Clinic ) one ( Fournier device ) Arthur Fournier ( University Miami ) . Objective : To compare HPV DNA detection cervicovaginal specimen collect use newly develop self-collection device , POI sampler Fournier device , HPV DNA detection cervicovaginal specimen collect use Darcon swab HPV DNA detection physician-directed cervical specimen . Methods : Two pilot do , one Cleveland Clinic POI sampler one University Arizona use Fournier device ( two different tip design ) , recruit 150 consent woman attend colposcopy clinic , include 50 woman refer due HSIL pap . Prior undergo pelvic exam insertion speculum , attend physician simulate self-collection cervicovaginal specimen use , alternate order , one new device Dacron swab . After collection cervicovaginal specimen , woman undergo standard colposcopic evaluation add cervical specimen collect os cervix serve referent standard . Specimens ( n=450 , 3 pair specimen per woman , POI sampler pilot ; n = 600 , 4 pair specimen per woman , Fournier device pilot ) test masked fashion oncogenic HPV DNA use Hybrid Capture 2 ( HC2 ; Digene Corporation Gathersburg , MD ) NCI HPV DNA core test facility .</detailed_description>
