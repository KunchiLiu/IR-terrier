	<brief_summary>This study examine effectiveness new laboratory method detect pneumocystis organism salt-water ( saline ) oral wash. Pneumocystis infection people weaken immunity especially patient HIV infection cancer , organ transplant recipient people receive immune suppress therapy cause life-threatening pneumonia . Currently , pneumocystis infection diagnose sputum analysis bronchoalveolar lavage . For sputum analysis , patient induce produce sputum sample ( liquid discharge lung ) use saline mist ; however , many hospital lack expertise perform procedure . The second method , bronchoalveolar lavage , involve insert flexible tube lung inject saline produce specimen diagnosis . This method , however , time-consuming uncomfortable . New technique may allow use oral wash diagnose pneumocystis , even though oral sample contains far few organism obtain current method . This study examine whether new technique , nucleic acid amplification , may enable simple oral wash use effectively diagnosis pneumocystis infection . Patients 3 year age older weaken immunity acute pneumonia may eligible study . In addition , people increase risk infection pneumocystis , include health care professional , family member patient , patient health care facility , may participate . Participants medical history review medical record determine health status determine recent respiratory problem document PCP . They provide oral wash sample . For procedure , subject first rinse mouth well . Then , vigorously swish 50 milliliter saline 5 10 second immediately repeat procedure provide two specimen . Washes may request daily , weekly , monthly , period time specify . Participants also two tube blood drawn ( total 20 milliliter , 4 teaspoon ) test evidence pneumocystis . Although test require protocol , participant may ask provide optional add ' l sample , follow : If sputum bronchoalveolar lavage sample required course patient clinical mgmt , enough material obtain , possible , research purpose well need routine care . An induced sputum sample may request protocol . For procedure , mask saline mist place face , induce cough , hop , produce sputum lung .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study design collect respiratory secretion specimens blood sample facilitate study human Pneumocystis infection disease , detect gene associate drug resistance , assess strain variation . This study also contribute information epidemiology Pneumocystis assess normal volunteer expose Pneumocystis , e.g . health professional , look strain variation among isolates patient , positive find , healthy volunteer . This study potentially facilitate development technique basis definitive study diagnosis , epidemiology , transmission Pneumocystis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Either : A . Patients ( male female ) immunosuppressed acute pneumonia undergo undergone clinically indicated procedure , bronchoscopy sputum induction , obtain respiratory sample diagnostic purpose . B . Patients ( male female ) immunosuppressed acute pneumonia individual likely expose environmental persontoperson source organisms , include healthy volunteer ( without respiratory disease ) , health care professional , patient family , patient health care facility willing provide oral wash , nasal sample blood sample consider provide induce sputum sample . All age great equal 3 year . Only child clinically indicate induced sputum bronchoscopy include study ( nasal specimen collect child ) . Ability individual guardian give inform consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : For enrollment category B , individual safely provide oral wash nasal sample ( nasopharyngeal swab , nasal wash ) determine health care provider .
