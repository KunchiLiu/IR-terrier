	<detailed_description>Prevention Endotracheal Intubation NIV CPAP Mechanical ventilation endotracheal tube lifesaving procedure acute respiratory failure . However endotracheal intubation increase patient 's discomfort stress , often require sedation , may cause injury tracheal mucosa tracheal stenosis ( 1 ) , represent one important predispose factor develop nosocomial bacterial pneumonia . In conscious cooperative patient non invasive positive pressure ventilation ( NPPV ) safe effective mean treat patient acute respiratory failure ( ARF ) , improve gas exchange reduce rate complication relate mechanical ventilation . Noninvasive ventilation CPAP perform full face mask . Facial mask may induce intolerance pain , discomfort claustrophobia lead discontinuation noninvasive ventilation endotracheal intubation . During early phase hypoxemic acute respiratory failure disconnection mechanical ventilation occurs , patient rapidly deteriorate gas exchange potential life threaten consequence . Despite improvement facial mask characteristic , skin necrosis may occur 7 % patient treat NPPV period exceed 72 hour . Attempting improve tolerability patient use new interface consist Helmet make latex-free PVC allow patient see , read speech noninvasive pressure support ventilation ( NPSV ) CPAP ( Continuos Positive Airways Pressure ) . The efficacy helmet recently test successfully apply deliver CPAP hospital treatment patient pulmonary edema . Recently match control study report efficacy NPPV use helmet treat adult patient hypoxemic ARF comparison NPSV use standard facial mask . No prospective randomize control study publish comparison Continuous Positive Airways pressure ( CPAP ) , deliver helmet medical treatment Oxygen supplementation treat early acute respiratory failure acute lung injury . Aim present protocol compare efficacy CPAP deliver helmet conventional medical treatment oxygen supplementation via Venturi mask , prevent ETI patient early hypoxemic ARF ( paO2 /FiO2 le 300 ) . Patients enrol randomly assign receive either standard treatment oxygen supplementation deliver Venturi mask CPAP Helmet . Computer-generated random assignment conceal sealed envelop The ethic committee Catholic University Rome approve protocol , patient next-of-kin give write informed consent . Helmet CPAP During CPAP , helmet connect conventional tubing free flow CPAP generator ( CaStar Flow generator , Starmed , Italy ) inspiratory flow 45 l/min ( Patroniti Intensive Care Med ( 2003 ) 29:1680.1687 ) , avoid need reservoir bag risk rebreathing The Helmet ( CaStar Flow , Starmed , Italy ) make transparent latex-free PVC allow patient see , read interact environment . The helmet secure two arm-pit brace two hook metallic ring join helmet seal connection soft collar around neck . The helmet available three different size order ameliorate comfort specific seal connector place metallic ring use allow passage nasogastric tube avoid air leakage . This connector also use allow patient drinking straw . A multiple value PEEP valve ( range 0-20 cm H2O ) ( Starmed PEEP valve Mirandola Italy ) connect expiratory port Helmet , PEEP value confirm anaeroid manometer . If necessary helmet easily remove endotracheal intubation perform rapidly . The patient sedate . CPAP initiate FiO2 equal great 0.5 . PEEP level start 5 cmH2O augment 2 cmH2O stepwise clinically need assure level arterial oxygen saturation equal great 92 % . CPAP level reduce progressively clinical improvement discontinue patient PaO2 / FiO2 300 RR low 30 breaths/min , without PEEP activation accessory muscle respiration Venturi Mask group Patients assign standard treatment group receive oxygen supplementation via Venturi mask start fraction inspire oxygen equal great 0.5 , adjust achieve initial level arterial oxygen saturation equal great 92 % . Oxygen cessation criterion : patient PaO2 / FiO2 300 RR low 30 breaths/min , without activation accessory muscle respiration Criteria endotracheal intubation Patients fail CPAP standard treatment intubate orotracheally cuffed endotracheal tube ( internal diameter 7.5 8.5 mm ) mechanically ventilate . Predetermined criterion endotracheal intubation identical group include one following : inability patient tolerate helmet , include discomfort , claustrophobia pain . - PaO2 150 least , one Following - Loss alertness agitation need sedation - Signs exhaustion - Absence cough , inability maintain airway head felxion - Respiratory arrest - Hemodynamic instability ( MAP 65 mmHg . ) frequent recurrent non perfuse dysarrhythmia - Cardiac arrest - Signs patient distress accessory muscle recruitment paradoxical abdominal motion - RR 35 RR/min - Respiratory acidosis ( pH 7.3 PaCO2 50 mmHg ) Conventional ventilation treatment failure Intravenous benzodiazepine ( Midazolam ) propofol use sedation moment intubation , possible none patient receive paralyze agent . The initial ventilator set assist-controlled ventilation mode deliver tidal volume 6-7 ml/kilogram IBW initial respiratory rate 18-25 breaths/min , PEEP 5 cmH2O , FiO2 0.8 . Subsequent change ventilator set do accord NIH protocol . ( N Engl J Med 2000 ; 342:1301-8 . ) All patient wean ventilator reduce level pressure support 4 cmH2O twice 2 hour interval tolerate 8 cmH2O pressure support . If patient tolerate pressure support level 8 cmH2O FiO2 equal less 0.5 , 2 hour T-piece trial initiate ( 11 ) . These patient extubated maintain respiratory rate le 30 breaths/min PaO2 great 75 mm Hg Plan experiment Multicenter , randomize control clinical trial . Enrolled patient randomly assign receive either standard treatment oxygen supplementation deliver Venturi mask CPAP Helmet . Each patient observe following day discontinuation failure . Arterial blood gas level determine baseline , breathe Venturi mask , 1 hour CPAP , 6-12 hour interval first 24 hour . ABG daily determine following day discontinuation failure . End Points Definitions The primary outcome variable evaluation need endotracheal intubation . Secondary end point include improvement gas exchange , complication present admission ( ventilator-associated pneumonia extra-pulmonary sepsis ) , duration ventilatory assistance , length hospital stay , ICU mortality . For patient number day free mechanical ventilation record first 28 day admission hospital discharge . Improvement gas exchange define ability increase PaO2 : FiO2 ratio 300 increase ratio 100 base line . ( 4-5 ) Improvement gas exchange evaluate within 1 hour ( initial improvement ) study entry time ( sustained improvement ) . Sustained improvement gas exchange defined ability maintain define improvement PaO2/FiO2 mechanical ventilation discontinue , confirm serial blood gas measurement . Population study Experimental Center This trial multicenter involve four different intensive care unit Italy ( Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore , Università dell'Insubria-Varese , Università di Torino , Ospedale S. Gerardo di Monza Power study Under assumption actual difference within treatment 20 % ( 20 vs. 40 % intubation rate ) type 1 error level 0.05 desired power 90 % , Helmet Venturi group , sample size compute like 80 Helmet group 80 Venturi group . Keeping account 20 % attrition rate 190 patient enrol study . The primary end-point proportion endotracheal intubation two group . Secondary End-points Secondary end point improvement gas exchange , complication present admission ( ventilator-associated pneumonia extra-pulmonary sepsis ) , complication directly relate noninvasive CPAP skin breakdown , gastric distension conjuctivitis , duration ventilatory assistance , length ICU hospital stay , ICU 28 day mortality .</detailed_description>
