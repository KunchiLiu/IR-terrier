	<brief_summary>This study compare overall survival patient acute myeloid leukemia , complete remission follow initial treatment chemotherapy whose remission maintain either transplantation stem cell obtain sibling unrelated donor standard treatment , additional chemotherapy . The study hypothesis group transplant stem cell donor superior survival compare patient treat standard care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reduced Intensity Conditioning Transplantation Versus Standard Care Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : The primary objective study determine whether RICT lead improve overall survival three year compare conventional treatment AML . The secondary objective study determine : - RICT lead superior long-term overall survival compare conventional therapy . - RICT lead superior disease-free survival compare conventional therapy . - Time relapse different RICT control group . - Quality life different two treatment group . - RICT patient : - Safety feasibility procedure - Incidence severity acute chronic Graft versus Host Disease ( GvHD ) - Rate complete partial chimerism Study Population : - Newly diagnose patient de novo secondary AML , intermediate poor risk , first complete remission age 51-70 year . - Not plan full-dose allogeneic transplant . - According investigator , fit RICT suitable donor find , also fit consolidation chemotherapy case suitable donor find . Procedures : Patients receive induction therapy accord institutional practice include achieve complete remission follow induction course ( ) . Patients full-dose conditioned allogeneic transplantation plan approach , neither patient reason judge ineligible RICT . Eligible patient inform study . After patient 's consent obtain , potential sibling donor ( ) briefly inform study ask willing undergo HLA-typing . Siblings evident contraindication granulocyte colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) collection peripheral blood stem cell proceed HLA-typing . A search unrelated match donor ( MUD ) initiate potential sibling donor , sibs HLA-identical otherwise fit donation procedure . A patient 's inclusion study blood sample tissue type ( HLA-typing ) first potential sibling donor make , search warrant MUD dispatch . - Note : To enable early donor search , patient may register , include , study prior CR . These patient include date achieve CR . Registered patient achieve CR include . Included patient HLA-identical sibling identify MUD assign RICT group , include patient without donor automatically control group . This HLA-based assignment , final intent-to-treat analysis base treatment assignment . After treatment assignment , patient control arm receive consolidation therapy per institutional practice , whereas patient RICT arm may proceed directly RICT receive one maximum two consolidation course . Patients complete remission time transplant . All patient follow relapse survival period least three year . The inclusion 352 patient complete remission provide statistical power 90 % detect difference overall survival three year 20 percentage point , ie 30 % control patient 50 % RICT patient .</detailed_description>
