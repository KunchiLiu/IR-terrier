	<brief_summary>The Family Investigation Nephropathy Diabetes ( FIND ) multicenter study design identify genetic determinant diabetic kidney disease . FIND conduct eleven center many ethnic group throughout United States . Two different strategy use localize gene predispose kidney disease : family-based genetic linkage study case-control study utilizes admixture linkage disequilibrium . The center base Phoenix office National Institute Diabetes Digestive Kidney Diseases ( NIDDK-Phoenix ) conduct family-based linkage study among American Indian population southwestern United States . Participants ( index case ) diabetes kidney disease initially recruit , parent sibling also invite participate . Genetic material participant use genotype marker throughout genome . Linkage analysis conduct identify particular chromosomal region contain gene influence susceptibility diabetic kidney disease . Linkage analyse also use identify gene influence trait relate diabetic kidney disease , serum creatinine , urinary protein excretion , plasma glucose level , blood pressure blood lipid level . Regions show evidence linkage examine detail , genetic linkage association study , attempt identify specific gene influence diabetic kidney disease , related trait . The identification gene influence susceptibility diabetic kidney disease lead well understanding kidney disease develop . In long run , may lead improved treatment prevention diabetic kidney disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Family Investigation Nephropathy Diabetes ( FIND ) multicenter study design identify genetic determinant diabetic kidney disease . FIND conduct eleven center many ethnic group throughout United States . Two different strategy use localize gene predispose kidney disease : family-based genetic linkage/association study case-control study use admixture linkage disequilibrium . The center base Phoenix office National Institute Diabetes Digestive Kidney Diseases ( NIDDK-Phoenix ) conduct family-based linkage/association study among American Indian population southwestern United States , indigenous Micronesian population Territory Guam Commonwealth Northern Mariana Islands ( CNMI ) . Participants ( index case ) diabetes kidney disease recruit , parent sibling also invite participate . Members target population related index case also include offer screen diabetes kidney disease ; facilitate association study . Genetic material participant use genotype marker throughout genome . Linkage association analysis conduct identify particular chromosomal region contain gene influence susceptibility diabetic kidney disease . Linkage association analysis also use identify gene influence trait relate diabetic kidney disease , serum creatinine , urinary protein excretion , plasma glucose level , blood pressure blood lipid level . Genome-wide candidate gene association study also conduct . Regions show evidence linkage association examine detail , genetic linkage association study , attempt identify specific gene influence diabetic kidney disease , related trait . The identification gene influence susceptibility diabetic kidney disease lead well understanding kidney disease develop .
