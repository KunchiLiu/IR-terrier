	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) may cause hematologic malignancy thyroid cancer . HCV infection common among U.S. military veteran receive care Veterans Administration healthcare system . The investigator propose retrospective cohort study use VA administrative database . A cohort approximately 147,000 HCV-infected veteran identified period 1997-2004 . Likewise , cohort approximately 573,000 HCV-uninfected veteran identify period . These subject evaluate diagnosis hematologic malignancy , thyroid cancer , relate medical condition record VA database . The comparison prevalence incidence cancer two cohort provide test hypothesis HCV infection cause cancer . The investigator also evaluate association HCV infection several medical condition , might relate HCV infection , specifically : immune thrombocytopenic purpura , autoimmune hemolytic anemia , cholangiocarcinoma , cholangitis , pancreatic cancer .</detailed_description>
