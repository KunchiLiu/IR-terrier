	<brief_summary>Background : - An inadequate filtering system Mayak nuclear weapon production facility Ozyorsk , Russia , allow release various radioactive material , particularly I-131 ( radioactive iodine ) city 's atmosphere 1950s . - A recent pilot study find high prevalence thyroid nodule Ozyorsk resident expose radiation childhood year heavy atmospheric emission ( 1952-1953 ) child expose later year ( 1967 1991 ) almost radioactive release . - Understanding role I-131 development thyroid disease important I-131 commonly use medicine ( e.g. , treat hyperthyroidism thyroid cancer diagnose thyroid disease ) , major source thyroid gland exposure fallout atomic bomb explosion , nuclear power plant accident , atmospheric vent plutonium manufacturing facility . Objectives : -To expand pilot study include 350 Ozyorsk resident expose childhood moderate level radiation order evaluate thyroid disease relation dose I-131 exposure . Eligibility : -People born live Ozyorsk , Russia 1954 1955 , period mild radioactive release Mayak nuclear weapon plant . Design : - Participants ' thyroid gland structure examine ultrasound examination blood test . - Participants possible thyroid gland disorder refer specialist additional diagnostic procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We plan expand complete pilot study evaluate prevalence thyroid abnormality relation childhood exposure atmospheric emission radioactive iodine Mayak Nuclear Weapons Plant Ozyorsk , Russia . The pilot study population compose defined cohort approximately 900 Ozyorsk resident bear January 1 , 1952 December 31 , 1953 . The exposed population comprise person live Ozyorsk year heavy atmospheric release ( 1952-1953 ) . Members nonexposed group move Ozyorsk 1967 1991 , i.e . almost radioactive release . Results pilot study suggest elevate prevalence thyroid nodule expose population . Given positive result pilot study US Department Energy 's ( DOE ) decision fund dose reconstruction project Ozyorsk population , intend expand study include additional 350 people born live Ozyorsk 1954 1955 , i.e . expose moderate level radiation . Methods similar use pilot study use expand study . Members study population invite participate special thyroid screen protocol come annual routine medical examination Ozyorsk automate dispensary system ( ASDOC ) . The thyroid gland clinically examine two ASDOC physician specifically train thyroid palpation . Thyroid abnormality detect base physical examination , assessment TSH level , ultrasound image . Biochemical laboratory test , include Free T ( 4 ) , anti-thyroperoxidase antibody assay necessary . Patients send consult endocrinologist palpation , ultrasound laboratory finding suggest thyroid disorder . Fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) biopsy perform tumor suspect . Although FNA do part study research , rather part regular Ozyorsk medical system , result give study staff help make diagnostic decision . Patients complicate thyroid disease refer experienced consulting thyroid specialist . Patients diagnose thyroid disease treat within regular medical system Ozyorsk .</detailed_description>
