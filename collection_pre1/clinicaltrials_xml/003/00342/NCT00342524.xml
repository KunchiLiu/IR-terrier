	<brief_summary>The purpose study collect plasma apheresis patient recover Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) . This plasma process SARS-antibody enrich intravenous immune globulin ( IVIG ) product . This product available use clinical trial SARS epidemic recurs . Potentially eligible participant people 18 56 year age recover SARS . Potential participant undergo three sequential screening determine eligibility study . Eligible participant schedule plasmapheresis . After apheresis , additional testing perform sample source plasma . Once sample test cleared , source plasma ship United States storage facility finally site manufacturing IVIG product . Participants may donate plasma 14 day . The study direct benefit participant . However , participation may help develop treatment could useful people become infected SARS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Collection Convalescent SARS Plasma Apheresis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Beginning February 2003 , outbreak novel coronavirus cause atypical pneumonia , subsequently refer Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) . This syndrome associate high mortality rate prove treatment . There , however , evidence treatment convalescent plasma beneficial . The primary purpose protocol collect plasma apheresis patient recover SARS , process plasma high titer anti-SARS intravenous immune globulin ( IVIG ) . This collaboration National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases Chinese University Hong Kong . Cangene Corporation contract manufacture collect plasma United States ( U.S. ) IVIG product , use pre-clinical efficacy study IND clinical trial SARS recur . It intend treatment trial would conduct Hong Kong and/or U.S. , well place disease recurs .</detailed_description>
