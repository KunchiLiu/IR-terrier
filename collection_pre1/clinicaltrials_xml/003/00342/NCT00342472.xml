	<brief_summary>The overall goal project determine whether polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( PAHs ) contribute high rate esophageal cancer Linxian , China . Esophageal cancer one fatal cancer worldwide Linxian , China one high rate world . In United States esophageal cancer cause approximately 10,000 death year . It fourth common cause cancer death black male eighth lead cause cancer death men race . Although several recent study identify molecular change associate esophageal cancer , prevention treatment within high risk group continue limited inability identify specific etiologic agent . Human exposure PAHs , include benzo [ ] pyrene ( B [ ] P ) , associate increased rate skin , lung , upper GI tumor also increase mortality cause related atherosclerosis . Evidence , include preliminary result histologic food analysis pilot study , support idea region 's high rate esophageal cancer may relate long-term , high-level exposure PAHs via inhalation air-borne pollution ingestion food cook soft coal . Thus , assess association PAHs high rate esophageal cancer Linxian , China , plan analyze sample food presence PAHs , sample blood Hb adduct ( marker long-term PAH exposure ) , sample urine 1-OH-Pyrene glucuronide ( maker short-term PAH exposure ) , sample coal characteristic may associate increased carcinogenesis . We also administer environmental questionnaire include question type fuel use cooking heating , location type stove and/or heat unit ( i.e. , vented versus unvented ) , time spent cooking .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overall goal project determine whether polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( P AHs ) acetaldehyde contribute high rate esophageal cancer Linxian , China . Esophageal cancer one fatal cancer worldwide Linxian , China high rate cancer world . In United States esophageal cancer cause approximately 14,000 death year . It fourth common cause cancer death black male eighth lead cause cancer death men race . The prevention treatment esophageal cancer within high risk group continue limited inability identify specific etiologic agent . Human exposure PAHs , include benzo [ ] pyrene ( B [ ] P ) associate increase rate skin , lung , esophageal gastric tumor also increase mortality cause related atherosclerosis . Preliminary result histologic food analysis pilot study support possibility high rate esophageal cancer Linxian may relate long-term , high level exposure PAHs via inhalation air-borne pollution ingestion food cook soft coal . Exposure acetaldehyde could also etiologically significant exposure Linxian . Acetaldehyde carcinogenic metabolite , small quantity ethanol recently find homogenize Linxian food sample . The Salaspuro laboratory University Helsinki demonstrate oral bacteria produce acetaldehyde food contain similar small concentration ethanol , acetaldehyde exposure could etiologically significant Linxian . Genetic polymorphism , particularly involve alcohol acetaldehyde dehydrogenases , may also influence effect exposure . To assess association PAHs acetaldehyde high rate esophageal cancer Linxian , China , plant analyze sample food presence PAHs , ethanol acetaldehyde , sample blood Hb DNA adduct ( marker long-term PAH acetaldehyde exposure ) , sample urine 1-OH-Pyrene glucuronide ( marker short term PAH exposure ) sample saliva acetaldehyde sample coal characteristic may associate increased carcinogenesis . We also administer environmental questionnaire include question type fuel use cooking heating , location type stave and/or heat unit , time spent cooking .</detailed_description>
