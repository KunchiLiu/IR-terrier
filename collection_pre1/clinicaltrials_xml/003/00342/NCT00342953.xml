	<brief_summary>This study examine long-term health effect cosmetic breast augmentation ( enlargement ) silicone gel breast implant . There concern time possible effect breast implant immune system particularly regard development certain connective tissue disorder possibility implant may interfere ability detect breast cancer . More recently , concern raise regard possible cancer-causing effect implant . These concern heighten report polyurethane foam coat envelops silicone gel implant may dissolve produce chemical call 2,4 , -diamino toluene ( TDA ) , link increase risk breast cancer rat mice . To address issue , study gather information medical record questionnaire survey approximately 12,000 breast implant patient . The questionnaire request information perceive complication implant ; history breast examination mammograms ; frequency breast self examination ; development disease ( particularly cancer connective tissue disorder ) develop subsequent augmentation surgery ; potential risk factor disease , age menarche ( onset menstruation ) , age first birth , age type menopause ( natural due surgery ) ; history breast biopsy ; immune system connective tissue disorder ; cigarette smoking ; alcohol consumption ; family medical history , forth . To evaluate result , information compare data 4,000 woman underwent plastic surgery procedure , rhinoplasty , facelift , liposuction , dermabrasion , eyelifts , others , practice breast augmentation patient . Participants recruit study several large reconstructive plastic surgery practice . Among breast implant patient , woman bilateral breast implant cosmetic purpose , breast reconstruction breast cancer surgery , eligible . Women history breast cancer may participate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although approximately 2 million woman country undergone augmentation mammoplasty , little know long-term effect . There concern time regard possible effect implant material immune system . In addition , long-standing concern breast implant may deter detection breast cancer . More recently , concern develop possible carcinogenicity material use implant . Of particular concern recognition polyurethane foam coat use contain silicone gel implant comprise chemicaI 2 , 4-diamino toluene , TDA , link increased risk breast well cancer rat mice . To address concern , retrospective cohort study approximately 12,000 breast implant patient propose . It anticipate woman recruit number large reconstructive plastic surgery practice several diverse area . The cohort construct manner variety different implant type represent average 10 year follow-up patient achieve . Records collaborate practice review obtain identifier potential study subject , particular surgery possible co-variates subsequent disease . Using variety source , subject trace current vital status residence . A questionnaire develop sent study subject . This questionnaire request information subject perceive complication implant , history breast examination mammogram , frequency breast self examination , development disease subsequent operation ( particular interest cancer connective tissue disorder ) , potential risk factor diseases interest ( e.g. , age menarche , age first birth , age type menopause , family medical history , immune alteration ) . Because difficulty compare population external standard , internal comparison cohort also assemble . This consist approximately 4,000 woman receive operation plastic surgery practice breast augmentation patient . This comparison group consist woman undergo variety cosmetic plastic surgery procedure , rhinoplasty . Attempts make assemble cohort similar age operation date breast implant patient . Records patient abstract follow-up pursued manner mammoplasty patient . The cancer incidence mortality experience augmentation mammoplasty patient compare general population rate ( use SEER cancer incidence U.S. mortality rate ) experience plastic surgery patient . Analyses risk connective tissue disorder focus solely internal comparison , give absence available population incidence rate disorder . Analyses include effort ass risk various implant characteristic , include age , calendar time , interval since implantation . Internal analyse enabled adjustment recognize risk factor , particularly cancer interest .</detailed_description>
