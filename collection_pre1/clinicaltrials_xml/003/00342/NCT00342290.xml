	<brief_summary>Early pregnancy associate numerous physiologic alteration - many required establish normal pregnancy outcome . Three-dimensional ultrasound may provide new opportunity well characterize early change . This noninvasive method allow one arbitrarily scan digital ultrasound volume data , visualize organ different perspective , render anatomical feature computer processing . Retrospective measurement distance volumes even possible physical absence patient . New information provide three-dimensional ultrasound may lead improved understanding counsel parent regard early pregnancy complication bleed . For example , vaginal bleeding complicates approximately 15-20 % first trimester pregnancy . A common association subchorionic hemorrhage associate increase risk miscarriage , preterm delivery , preterm premature rupture membrane , stillbirth , placental abruption . Several study attempt characterize subchorionic hemorrhage conventional two-dimensional ultrasound particularly well-suited accurate measurement small irregular hematoma . Consequently , considerable debate significance find especially asymptomatic woman undergo prenatal ultrasound examination reason . This protocol attempt identify prognostic indicator adverse pregnancy outcome . A maximum 400 pregnant woman 20 week ' gestation sonographically detect subchorionic hemorrhage serially study characterize sac volume , placental volume , hematoma volume , placental blood vessel pattern 3DUS technique . These result correlate pregnancy outcome , hormonal marker , placental pathology . This information expect improve understanding natural history subchorionic bleeding spontaneous miscarriage well prognostic factor influence pregnancy outcome symptomatic asymptomatic woman .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Miscarriage common outcome pregnancy . Vaginal bleeding complicate 25 % pregnancy , clinical sign associate increase risk spontaneous abortion ( also know miscarriage ) adverse pregnancy outcome , spontaneous preterm labor , preterm premature rupture membrane , pre-eclampsia intrauterine growth restriction . Despite importance vaginal bleeding clinical obstetrics , inadequate understanding mechanism lead vaginal bleeding , test predict pregnancy outcome majority case . A common finding patient first trim vaginal bleeding subchorionic hemorrhage , associate increase risk miscarriage , preterm delivery , preterm premature rupture membrane , stillbirth , placental abruption . Previous attempt characterize subchorionic hemorrhage use two-dimensional ultrasound , well-suited accurate measurement volume irregular hematoma . It surprising debate significance subchorionic hemorrhage , especially asymptomatic woman undergo prenatal ultrasound examination reason intrauterine hematoma find . Three-dimensional ultrasonography potential improve characterization volume location intrauterine hematoma . This information may value predict pregnancy outcome . The Perinatology Research Branch propose first trim bleed one great obstetrical syndrome ; condition characterize collection sign symptom ( case vaginal bleed cramp ) , multiple etiology . We propose first trimester bleeding may result hemostatic disorder prenatal endometrium ( decidua ) , cause pathologic factor include ( 1 ) genetic disorder chromosomal abnormality often result miscarriage first trim pregnancy ; ( 2 ) congenital acquire hemostatic abnormality due thrombophilic mutation ; ( 3 ) abnormal endocrine process may lead dysregulation endometrial event require successful pregnancy ; ( 4 ) abnormal immunological response maternal/embryo/fetal interface . These abnormality , could clinical significance , investigate ultrasound . This protocol describe comprehensive systematic study woman present bleed first trimester pregnancy , improve understand relationship location size hematoma ( three-dimensional ultrasound ) factor may determine subsequent development adverse pregnancy outcome . The Branch execute protocol establish first-trimester clinic study patient present common complication pregnancy . First trimester bleed common important complication pregnancy neglect area investigation private public agency . We intend address orphan area clinical research .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All pregnant subject recruit informed consent Hutzel Hospital . The study population arm protocol involve pregnant woman age 15 yearsold old Hutzel Hospital . The ethnic background estimate involve approximately 60 percent Caucasian 40 percent African American side . Accurate pregnancy date criterion . Estimated gestational age less equal 20 week ' gestation . Visible fetus normal heart rate rhythm . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Poor visualization fetus due technical factor ( e.g . obesity ) . Risk factor increase risk keep serial ultrasound appointment . Desire vaginal ultrasound scan .</criteria>
