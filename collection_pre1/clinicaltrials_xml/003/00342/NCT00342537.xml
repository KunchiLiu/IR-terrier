	<brief_summary>This study collaboration Clinical Genetics Branch National Cancer Institute International Testicular Cancer Linkage Consortium ( ITCLC ) . The primary goal ITCLC mapping clone susceptibility gene familial TGCT . The objective current study : - Identify gene responsible testicular germ cell tumor ( TGCT ) ( testicular cancer ) family inherit tendency develop disease - Determine gene predispose develop testicular cancer also increase risk specific type cancer among first- second-degree relative patient TGCT - Determine microscopic appearance familial testicular cancer different non-familial TGCT Patients family member recruit ITCLC United Kingdom , Netherlands , Norway eligible study . Individuals follow medical criterion may participate : - Patients testicular germ cell cancer least one blood relative disease - Family member patient ( first- second-degree relative ) Participants undergo follow procedure : - Fill questionnaires provide information history cancer blood relative , include parent , sibling , child , grandparent , aunt , uncle , cousin , history undescended testis male blood relative . Participants may ask permission contact family member request help study well . - Provide blood sample genetic testing relate TGCT ( except child 16 year old ) . - Review medical record examination tumor specimen ( patient TGCT ) . - Confirmation diagnosis type cancer family ( medical record , pathology repots ) - Review testicular cancer tissue obtain time surgery member multiple case family , comparison finding series TGCT develop men without family history .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Familial cluster testicular germ cell tumor ( TGCT ) well-documented , family history TGCT associate increase risk disease . The International Testicular Cancer Linkage Consortium ( ITCLC ) assemble 350 multiple case TGCT family support linkage effort provisionally map susceptibility gene chromosome Xq27 subset kindred . However , familial TGCT genetically heterogeneous , thus increase need meticulous case definition classification ongoing genetic etiologic study . The histopathologic classification TGCT complicate ; pathologist extensive experience review uncommon tumor . Basing epidemiologic study upon local pathology report may result failure recognize etiologically critical TGCT subset kind central suspect define various hereditary cancer syndrome , multiple inherited renal cancer disorder . Few study address risk cancer among relative sporadic TGCT patient . Recent report suggest 20 % increase overall cancer risk among first-degree relative TGCT patient site-specific excess cancer risk male relative mother TGCT patient . These cancer sit constitute disease prior evidence suggest genetic relationship TGCT . Identification cancer part familial TGCT disease spectrum would provide clinically relevant insight syndrome , enhance statistical power gene-seeking linkage analysis . We propose two study , target ITCLC set high-risk TGCT family , none come US : ( ) Centralized Pathology Review Familial TGCT ; ( b ) The Occurrence Cancer Other Germ Cell Tumors TGCT Families . Data provide three large ITCLC contributor ; contact TGCT probands relative collect primary data familial non-familial TGCT , perform data analysis study . NCI neither seek receive individual identifying information participant . Currently , UK collaborator complete acquisition Federal Wide Assurance ( FWA ) local ethical review . Since group contribute 70 % family two project , bring component NCI Special Studies IRB . We shall return IRB review two contributor upon completion local ethical review process .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : The criterion establish familial TGCT presence least two case document GCT blood relative . A case determine TGCT accord follow criterion : Pathologic confirmation germ cellderived tumor arise testis . Estragonadal sperm cell tumor also include . Germ cellderived histology include : seminoma , embryonal carcinoma , endodermal sinus ( yolk sac ) tumor , gonadoblastoma , choriocarcinoma , teratoma , mixed germ cell tumor . A case determine TIN basis pathologic confirmation intratubular malignant germ cell ( ITMGCs ) define Burke Mostofi .</criteria>
