	<brief_summary>Two large , nutritional intervention trial conduct Linxian , China 1985-1991 . These trial test effect multiple vitamin mineral prevention esophageal cancer population high know rate disease world . Results trial show Beta-carotene + Vitamin E + selenium reduce total mortality , total cancer mortality , stomach cancer incidence mortality . Multivitamins/minerals also show reduction premalignant lesion . Preliminary follow-up data obtain time period cessation intervention 1991 suggest observe benefit total cancer mortality reduce benefit stomach cancer remain . The objective follow-up study : ( 1 ) continue determine cancer incidence cause mortality trial participant intervention permit examination potential effect intervention total cause-specific mortality cancer incidence post-intervention period ; ( 2 ) conduct cross-sectional nutritional survey subsample live trial participant evaluate nutritional status , asses validity dietary questionnaire , relate neurologic status vitamin B12 plasma level ; ( 3 ) collect blood sample live trial participant permit etiologic investigation genetic environmental hypothesis ; ( 4 ) perform nest case-control study select genetic environmental hypothesis . To accomplish objective follow-up study , : ( 1 ) determine update vital status cancer status data trial participant via monthly check village doctor record quarterly check Linxian Cancer Registry ; conduct Vital/Cancer Status Interview Survey among ( n-34,000 trial participant ( surrogate ) ; identify , collect , store available diagnostic material trial participant identify developed cancer die cancer follow-up period ; ( 2 ) conduct Nutritional Survey subsample ( n-1000 ) live trial participant include ( ) physical exam brief medical history , ( b ) neurologic history , ( c ) cognitive function exam , ( ) hair/mouth skin exam , ( e ) neurological exam , ( f ) nutritional questionnaire , ( g ) collection blood sample hematologic/biochemical analysis ; ( 3 ) conduct Blood Collection Survey live trial participant ( n-23,000 ) obtain ( ) physical exam brief medical history ( b ) single 10-ml blood sample separation preservation WBCs ( viable nonviable ) , RBCs , plasma genetic ( e.g. , xenobiotic polymorphism ) environmental ( e.g. , plasma ascorbic acid ) hypothesis test ; ( 4 ) perform Nested Case-Control Studies select genetic environmental hypothesis relate etiology prevention esophageal cancer stroke . These do use serum new cancer stroke case ( -2500 ) control ( -2500 ) previously identify 1991-1996 , well use new cancer stroke case control period 1996-2004 ( -9000 ) . The followup endpoint continue monthly additional 5 year ( year 2003 ) . The Nutritional Survey Blood Collection Survey conduct spring 1999 . The Nested Case-Control study perform annually begin 2000 , Vital/Cancer Interview Survey conduct Spring 2001 .</brief_summary>
