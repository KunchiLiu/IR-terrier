	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : We previously conduct retrospective cohort study 12,193 patient evaluated infertility 1960-1988 five clinical site . Detailed information abstract medical record , along questionnaire administer located patient cancer incidence mortality data derive cancer registry National Death Index , allow u examine cancer risk relate different cause infertility treatment control patient characteristic . Although increase certain cancer relate various cause infertility , generally observe substantial relationship relate use different fertility drug . The one exception increase risk uterine cancer clomiphene use , interest give drug 's chemical similarity tamoxifen . Our number patient certain cancer ( e.g. , ovarian , uterine ) , however , limited insufficient power evaluate subgroup effect ( e.g. , drug relationship among nulligravid woman ) . OBJECTIVES : We therefore conduct updated follow-up patient order ass cancer risk relation cause infertility therapeutic regimen use treat cause . ELIGIBILITY : This study gain additional 10 year follow-up among patient deem eligible previous investigation . This included woman primary second infertility . Approximately 39 % cohort previously prescribe clomiphene citrate , 10 % receive gonadotrophin . DESIGN : Passive follow-up attempt patient previously participate information available clinic record could retain . All patient trace active well passive follow-up . Active follow-up involved requesting patient complete short questionnaire , whereas passive follow-up via linkage cancer registries National Death Index . While cancer risk assess relation general population , majority comparison internal one , involve calculation relative risk ( RRs ) associate different cause infertility treatment regimens control cancer risk predictor .</detailed_description>
