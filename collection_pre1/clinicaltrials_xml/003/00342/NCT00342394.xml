	<detailed_description>This protocol describe exposure assessment study farmer North Carolina Iowa personally apply fungicide captan , thiophanate-methyl , benomyl apple peach orchard . The exposure assessment include environmental measurement well biological monitoring data . The biomonitoring data base 24-hour urinary metabolite three fungicide select study . The study do collaboration Agricultural Health Study ( AHS ) , large prospective health study license private ( farmer ) commercial applicator , spouse private applicator . The AHS sponsor National Cancer Institute , National Institute Environmental Health Sciences Environmental Protection Agency . The study describe conducted National Institute Occupational Safety Health . Retinal degeneration among applicator AHS associate cumulative day use five fungicide , include captan benomyl , heavily use orchard . Minimal monitoring data available fungicide exposure among orchard applicator U.S. Agent-specific exposure classification AHS base primarily questionnaire data , supplement exposure monitoring data non-cohort study literature . An algorithm develop AHS estimate individual 's cumulative exposure use information duration , frequency intensity exposure questionnaires . The intensity piece algorithm identifies factor either increase decrease exposure `` weight '' assign factor reflect relative impact factor exposure . Exposure data need validate algorithm , identify major exposure determinant , evaluate appropriateness assign weight . Fungicides apply regular interval throughout spring summer orchard . Captan frequently apply fungicide serve primary marker fungicide exposures orchard . Participants AHS select base plan use captan . A benzimidazole fungicide , thiophanate-methyl benomyl , often applied captan exposure thiophanate-methyl benomyl also monitor . Applicator exposure measure use environmental ( air , dermal patch , hand ) biological monitoring method . Captan metabolize tetrahydrophthalimide , excrete urine . Thiophanate-methyl benomyl share common metabolite , methyl ( 5-hydroxy-1H-benzimidazol-2-yl ) -carbamate , also excrete urine . Dupont voluntarily withdraw benomyl product market December 31 , 2001 ; however , exist supply benomyl may use 2002 . Due `` carryover '' use benomyl presence metabolite urine common thiophanate-methyl , prudent monitor benomyl exposure among participate applicator . A repeated measure design propose address likelihood high within-worker variability exposure measure . In summary , objective study 1 ) measure actual exposure target fungicide use environmental biological measure exposure , 2 ) identify quantify major determinant exposure , 3 ) describe within- between-worker exposure variability , 4 ) evaluate , extent possible , agreement exposure estimate compute use AHS exposure algorithm exposure estimate base actual measurement .</detailed_description>
