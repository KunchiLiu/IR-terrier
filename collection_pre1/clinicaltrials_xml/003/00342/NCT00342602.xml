	<brief_summary>This study identify genetic factor associate development progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) patient acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . PML life-threatening infection brain affect 5 percent untreated patient AIDS . Its symptom include mental deterioration , vision loss , speech disturbance , ataxia ( inability coordinate movement ) , paralysis , coma . PML cause polyomavirus call JC virus . It estimate 80 percent human population expose JC virus , disease rare . The virus become active people compromise immune system , undergo immune suppressive chemotherapy cancer damage immune system due HIV . Patients participate Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study may eligible study , well healthy normal volunteer serve control . The study review clinical information patient analyze genetic factor patient control subject investigate gene associate AIDS JC virus infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study identify host genetic factor contribute development Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy ( PML ) associate JC virus . JC virus one many opportunistic infection arise AIDS patient . JC virus widely distribute general population , estimate population exposure range 30-80 % . JC virus remain latent host , profoundly immunosuppressed patient , JC virus cause PML , fatal disease associate neurotropic JC virus lytically infect oligodendrocyte . In untreated AIDS population , frequency PML estimate roughly 5 % . This study identify host genetic factor may contribute development PML AIDS population .</detailed_description>
