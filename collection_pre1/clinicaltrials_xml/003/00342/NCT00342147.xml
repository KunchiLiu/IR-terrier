The disease believe multifactorial etiology genetic , viral , environmental factor involve . Little known , however , genetic component disease . We recently complete subject recruitment case-control study NPC Taiwan . Using information obtain NPC case recruit NCI-sponsored case-control study well parallel cross-sectional study conduct Taiwanese collaborator , able identify 120-150 family multiple family member affect NPC . The purpose study describe herein determine role inherit genetic factor etiology NPC examine effect genetic susceptibility factor risk associate environmental exposure . Families initially contact via proband previously participate case-control cross-sectional study . Subsequently , informative family member ask visit study clinic participate study . A family history questionnaire administer proband family select study . In addition , risk factor questionnaire administer participate family member , 30-40 ml blood oral sample obtain study participant . Additional study component include medical record review verify diagnosis NPC , retrieval tumor tissue block source DNA study , clinical exam sample unaffected individual exclude possibility prevalent , undetected disease among family member . Oral laryngeal cancer family also recruit manner similar describe NPC family , attempt elucidate genetic factor link development two cancer .</brief_summary>
