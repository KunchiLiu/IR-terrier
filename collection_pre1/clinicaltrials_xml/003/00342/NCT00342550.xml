	<brief_summary>Preterm labor lead cause perinatal morbidity mortality . Several investigator report ultrasound evaluation cervix predict risk preterm delivery . Three-dimensional ultrasound may provide additional information best counsel parent chance premature birth . This technology capability accurate volume measurement irregular structure superior conventional ultrasound . Therefore , possible three-dimensional ultrasound method may better characterize cervical change risk preterm delivery . Our protocol attempt identify prognostic indicator adverse pregnancy outcome three-dimensional ultrasound . A maximum 680 pregnant woman diagnosis preterm labor prospectively study characterize cervical morphology volume predictor preterm delivery risk . These result correlate placental pathology pregnancy outcome . We also compare performance conventional two-dimensional endovaginal ultrasound three-dimensional ultrasound finding .
