	<brief_summary>This study , conduct Beijing University First Hospital China National Cancer ( NCI ) , try identify gene associate either susceptibility resistance chronic infection hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) . Some people recover HBV infection ; others become chronically infected may go develop severe liver disease cirrhosis liver cancer . About 350 million people worldwide chronic HBV infection . Of 120 million infected Chinese , 90 percent child infect less 5 year age 10 percent infect adult develop persistent infection . HBV-infected non-infected healthy person Han ethnicity born 1963 may eligible study . Offspring infected candidate ( born year ) may also enrol . Infected adult must least one infected parent sibling . Persons reside Fusui County Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region Qidong district Jiangsu Province least 6 month 1986 may participate . All participant ( except offspring study subject ) fill health questionnaire ( provide information eating , drinking , smoke habit personal family health history ) donate 20 milliliter blood . The blood test antibody , antigen , substance may indicate infection hepatitis virus . Some blood send NCI DNA analysis identify genetic factor may influence clearance hepatitis virus infection progression liver disease associate HBV infection . Infected patient liver biopsy past asked permission examine tissue biopsy review laboratory result test do diagnostic treatment purpose . When study complete , specimens sent NCI identifier link material donor remove . The anonymous sample may use genetic study . Specimens remain China continue identifier link may use future study design identify great risk develop serious liver disease . Participants want blood use future study may request sample destroy . Because child inherit one-half DNA parent , DNA sample HBV infect study participant may provide additional information parent DNA structure . Offspring participate study provide DNA sample . The sample obtain swish mouthwash mouth 30 second spit mouth wash cup . The DNA isolate mouth cell .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Persistent hepatitis B viral ( HBV ) infection significant public health problem occurence chronic liver disease , cirrhosis , hepatocarcinoma ( HCC ) [ 1-3 ] . Roughly one-third world population infect HBV 350 million ( 5-6 % ) persistent carrier . HBV cause 80 % liver cancer second important carcinogen , smoke tobacco . There approximate 90 % risk become persistent carrier follow perinatal infection infant bear e antigen positive carrier mother 30 % risk pre-school child . Only 5-10 % adult become persistent carrier follow infection . Like HIV , HBV transmit contaminate blood transfusion intravenous drug use high-risk sexual behavior . The purpose investigation study different outcome hepatitis B exposure infection affect host genetic factor Chinese population , 120 million individual infected HBV . Of people persistently infect HBV , 10-30 % develop liver cirrhosis ( LC ) hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . These highly variable outcome clearance rate disease outcomes persistently infect individual fully explain difference viral environmental factor . Thus , difference host genetic factor may affect hepatitis B natural history . Blood collect volunteer China . Healthy donor unexposed HBV HCV , individual clear HBV , asymptomatic carrier HBV identify Peking University hospital blood bank . HBV infected individual chronic hepatitis , cirrhosis HCC identify Peking University hospital hepatitis clinic . Targeted individual ask participate letter telephone interview train hospital staff . A database clinical family information create questionnaire complete hospital staff . A database clinical family information create questionnaire complete hospital staff interviewer . Blood separate plasma peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) cryopreserved China . Serum test China hepatitis viral marker , HBV genotype , HBV viral load . Two vial PBMC transfer LGD , NCI-USA , mRNA expression assay host genetic analysis . Lymphoblastoid cell line establish LGD-NCI source renewable DNA . RNA extract PBMCs determination mRNA expression microarray method . Results mRNA expression assay literature search use identify candidate gene . DNA extract cell line genotyped single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) candidate gene DNA marker , include HLA , cytokine , chomokines , receptor , putative HBV cell entry target DNA genotyping method . SNPs candidate gene identify use public private SNP databases SNP discovery method . SNPs genotyped study participant analyze detect association polymorphisms phenotype obtain clinical laboratory testing . If genetic marker associate development disease phenotype find , potential application diagnostics therapy . The identification allelic polymorphism gene involve pathway chronic viral infection LC ultimately HCC would provide insight carcinogenic process .</detailed_description>
