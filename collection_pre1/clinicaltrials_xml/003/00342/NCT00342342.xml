	<brief_summary>This study examine blood specimen patient various eye disorder previously participate Beaver Dam Eye Study try identify gene responsible disorder . The Beaver Dam study design determine incidence cause age-related eye condition , include cataract ( change lens eye impair vision ) ; retinopathy ( diseases retina - thin layer tissue line back eye ) ; age-related maculopathy ( degeneration atrophy macula - center part retina responsible fine vision ) ; impair vision . Findings study others show age-related eye disorder often run family , indicate genetic component development . All participant Beaver Dam study family member study may include current NHGRI study . The Beaver Dam study include resident township Beaver Dam , Wisconsin , 45 84 year age enrollment . Participants thorough eye examination blood sample draw baseline 5 10 year baseline evaluation . Fifteen-year follow-ups start 2003 . This study analyze data blood sample previously collect Beaver Dam study participant identify gene relate numerous age-related visual trait . No new participant recruit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Beaver Dam Eye Study design determine long-term incidence cause cataract , age-related maculopathy ( ARM ) , retinopathy , impaired vision . Age-related macular degeneration cataract leading cause loss vision United States . In Beaver Dam , preliminary analysis indicate people 75+ year age baseline examination , 72 % developed nuclear cataract , 39 % developed cortical cataract , 22 % develop posterior subcapsular cataract ( PSC ) ; 37 % develop early ARM ( large soft indistinct drusen , retinal pigment epithelial ( RPE ) depigmentation , increase retinal pigment ) ; 10 % developed sign late ARM ( exudative macular degeneration geographic atrophy ) ; 37 % developed impairment vision ; 6 % develop severely impaired vision 10-year follow-up . Thus , common problem older person . Because people 75 year age older rapidly grow segment population estimate increase 60 % next 25 year , problem pose societal burden due large number old person affect . Additionally , observe substantial familial aggregation several trait : ARM , nuclear cataract , cortical cataract ocular refraction . The primary goal proposal perform linkage analysis data collect part Beaver Dam eye study . NHGRI investigator involve analysis cod data . Dr. Bailey-Wilson may provide financial support help cover cost DNA extraction budget NO sample send NHGRI . All NHGRI effort study fund Dr. Bailey-Wilson intramural budget . In addition data Beaver Dam Eye study , also analyze previously exist data glaucoma , intraocular pressure cup-disc ratio Framingham Eye Study ( FES ) substudy well know cohort study call Framingham Heart Study ( FHS ) . We perform linkage association analysis data comparison result find BDES data .</detailed_description>
