	<brief_summary>Data new cancer atlas cover period 1974 1994 indicate death bladder cancer among white men woman elevate northeastern United States , particularly northern part New England . The reason elevate rate incidence death bladder cancer unknown . Only part excess risk explain exposure textile leather industry . The purpose study determine factor contribute high rate incidence death bladder cancer northern New England . The main objective : - estimate risk develop bladder cancer associate inorganic arsenic drinking water , water contaminant , tobacco use , occupational exposure , residential proximity industrial site , dietary factor , ethnicity , use wood-burning stove . - estimate extent water contain inorganic arsenic explains increase rate bladder cancer . - estimate extent exposure risk factor explain increased rate . - evaluate risk bladder cancer accord genetic factor . - examine interaction factor tobacco use , occupational exposure , environmental exposure arsenic compound . All people age 30 79 confirmed case bladder cancer eligible study . Twelve hundred people bladder cancer twelve hundred individual previous bladder cancer include . After potential participant recruit agreement obtain telephone , complete calendar collect toenail clipping prior home interview . During home visit , investigator administer computer-assisted personal interview , collect drink water sample clipping , obtain global positioning satellite reading . Other biological sample , saliva sample , urine , blood , may request . Private well previous home participant also sample . The location previous home determine current homeowner ask allow sampling well . The association bladder cancer environmental exposure examine extent exposure risk factor explain elevated mortality incidence northern New England estimate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The New England Bladder Cancer Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data new cancer atlas cover period 1970-94 indicate bladder cancer mortality rate among white men woman elevate northeastern U.S. , particularly northern part New England include Maine , New Hampshire , Vermont . The reason high mortality rate unclear . The persistent elevation mortality incidence bladder cancer among men woman suggest possible role environmental etiologic factor . A lead suspect environmental exposure inorganic arsenic drinking water , elevate private well part New England . The purpose study determine risk factor explain high mortality incidence rate bladder cancer men woman northern New England . The study population-based case-control study carcinoma urinary bladder three state : New Hampshire , Vermont , Maine . All histologically-confirmed incident case carcinoma bladder occur within three-year period among resident study area age 30 79 year eligible study . Controls select randomly general population study area , frequency match age- , race- , gender-specific distribution incidence case bladder cancer state . We expect interview 1,200 case 1,200 control . Several data collection activity incorporate study : self-administered residential/occupational history calendar , self-administered diet questionnaire , in-person interview subject use computer-assisted personal interview ( CAPI ) , collection drinking water determine level arsenic contaminant drink water , collection buccal cell , toenail , spot urine , four-day urinary habit diary , overnight urine ( sample 240 case 240 control ) , blood ( sample 180 case 180 control ) . Tumor tissue sample obtain case . We examine association bladder cancer environmental exposure , estimate extent exposure risk factor explain elevate mortality incidence northern New England .</detailed_description>
