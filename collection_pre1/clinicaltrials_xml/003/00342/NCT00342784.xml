	<brief_summary>This study identify gene predispose men prostate cancer affect rate type disease spread , aggressiveness disease , long-term outcome . Several study show genetic component prostate cancer susceptibility , first-degree relative prostate cancer increase man 's risk 2- 3-fold compare without family history . The risk significantly higher relative diagnose young 65 year age , three first-degree relative affect . The study try locate prostate cancer gene DNA sample use two method : linkage analysis association study . Traditionally , search disease gene begin linkage analysis , aim find rough location gene relative another DNA sequence , call `` genetic marker , '' whose position already know . In genetic association study , gene large number patient compare healthy control match age , race , geographic region . DNA sample study come patient two follow study Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center , Seattle , Washington : Family study : Participants family prostate cancer : 1 ) three first-degree relative prostate cancer ; 2 ) three generation prostrate cancer either maternal paternal side family ; 3 ) two first-degree relative prostate cancer diagnose age 65 African American . Population-based study : Participants patient prostate cancer match healthy control subject . The identification prostate cancer gene important susceptibility disease aggressiveness may permit early detection development direct effective treatment base underlying genetics .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The notion prostate cancer susceptibility gene since suggest case-control , cohort twin study . The effect strong among first-degree relative , relative risk estimate range 1.7 3.7 . Families report young age diagnosis multiple relative prostate cancer demonstrate even higher relative risk . For example , compare men family history , men three first-degree relative prostate cancer almost 11-fold increased risk . Although majority study focus Caucasians , similar elevation risk associate family history disease report Asian African Americans . While majority data seem point towards autosomal dominant gene , evidence X-linked recessive inheritance also report . During last decade , others devote search hereditary prostate cancer ( HPC ) loci either linkage association candidate gene . A generally agree upon definition HPC family exist . These family either : 1 ) prostate cancer three first-degree relative ; 2 ) prostate cancer three successive generation ; 3 ) cluster two relative diagnose less equal 55 year . Armed criterion , others collect large data set likely hereditary family undertake genome wide scan . However , locus heterogeneity issue make task difficult . There clearly many gene contribute prostate cancer susceptibility , many likely weakly penetrant . We stratify data derive genome scan number likely factor age diagnosis , number affect men , founder effect aggressiveness disease , presence cancer family develop homogeneous datasets . We propose continue sort study , well focus clone gene region others identify date . To test hypothesis certain variant associate prostate cancer susceptibility progression disease , also conduct association study population-based , case control study middle age men prostate cancer . This allow u test putative association candidate gene SNPs prostate cancer susceptibility , aggressivity , long-term outcome .</detailed_description>
