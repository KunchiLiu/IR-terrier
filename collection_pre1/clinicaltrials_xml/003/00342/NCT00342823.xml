	<brief_summary>Visceral leishmaniasis potentially fatal disease cause South America protozoan Leishmania chagasi . In neighborhood high exposure rate , outcome human infection L. chagasi range asymptomatic disseminate waste disease call visceral leishmaniasis ( VL ) . Several study document familial clustering VL population risk . Segregation analyse favor genetic environmental model susceptibility L. chagasi infection . A peri-urban outbreak VL near Universidade Federal Rio Grande Norte ( UFRN ) Natal , northeast Brazil , allow u identify endemic neighborhood ongoing transmission L. chagasi infection . Natal ideal study endemic neighborhood easily accessible , people motivate cooperate measure control VL , form leishmaniasis transmitted region . Dr. Jeronimo UFRN , Dr. Mary Wilson University Iowa collect clinical data DNA 400 VL family live endemic neighborhood . We create unprecedented cohort identify four distinct phenotypic response L. chagasi exposure . We document familial cluster L. chagasi infection , result correlation segregation analysis consistent hypothesis genetic factor predispose , part , diverse clinical outcome infection . Polymorphism TNF locus associate develop symptomatic oppose asymptomatic disease infection . We recently complete genome-wide scan quantitative immune response ( DTH ) identify potential linkage region chromosomes 2 , 13 , 15 19 . We also identify small linkage peak chromosome 9 VL . In ongoing study , next perform fine mapping region use dense SNPs identify gene may determine susceptibility L. chagasi infection . Additionally , also analyze candidate gene association/linkage susceptibility protection L. chagasi disease . We recently identify association chromosome 5 DTH immune response among two linkage disequilibrium block span multiple immune relate gene .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : We use three approach identify family endemic neighborhood , yield three population family . Population I : A neighborhood northeast city identify family two case disease . Population 2 : Individuals suspect VL admit one three public hospital Natal . Families interview examine wished participate . Population 3 : The neighboring family live close population 2 family identify . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Individuals ongoing illness VL exclude analysis . Any medical condition find suspect base upon history , exam blood test either treat investigator refer appropriate medical facility Natal . Pregnant woman child less 1 year give skin test . No exclusion base ethnicity do .</criteria>
