	<brief_summary>This study look viral immunologic factor involve protect sexually transmit HIV infection couple one partner infect . This study include 50 couple reside Rakai , Uganda , together least 2 year . In couple , partner HIV-infected , couple one partner HIV , couple neither partner HIV . Participants undergo follow procedure four study visit : - HIV counsel test - Medical history , include question personal behavior sexual practice use condom - Blood sample collection - Urine sample collection - Vaginal swab woman Blood , urine vaginal fluid sample test HIV sexually transmit disease , syphilis . Blood vaginal sample also test HIV viral level immune response HIV-infected individual evidence exposure HIV non-infected participant . Some blood also test genetic marker investigate whether certain protein relate resistance HIV infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Viral Immunologic Factors Contributing Lack HIV Transmission Among Couples Rakai , Uganda</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Understanding factor contribute transmission human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection great importance development preventive therapeutic strategy . Evidence suggest number host immunologic virologic factor play critical role protection sexually transmit HIV infection HIV-discordant partner . Among , antiviral role CD8+ T cell HIV-infected individual extensively study . At least two type CD8+ T cell-mediated antiviral activity describe HIV infection . The first suppressive activity HIV involve lysis infect cell antigen-specific , HLA-restricted fashion , second mechanism inhibit viral replication via either cell- soluble mediate factor absence cell kill . It demonstrate cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes ( CTL ) present cervical peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) subpopulation highly-HIV-exposed persistently seronegative individual . However , study address effect non-cytotoxic soluble factor-mediated antiviral activity CD8+ T cell prevent seroconversion HIV-discordant couple lack . This study propose examine role CD8+ T cell-derived CC-chemokine activity copy number one chemokine gene , CCL3L1 , along host anti-HIV virologic factor resistance HIV infection persistently seronegative HIV-discordant partner HIV infect individual .</detailed_description>
