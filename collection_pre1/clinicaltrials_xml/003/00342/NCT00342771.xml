	<brief_summary>This study examine association genetic variant gene expression pattern risk prostate cancer . There ( It include ? ) genotype analysis blood DNA 600 patient disease 600 healthy people , gene expression analysis prostate tumor . Prostate cancer lead cause death among men Western country . It estimate 220,000 new case disease occur United States 2004 . The disease incidence rise . About 25 % 30 % cancer become aggressive . The nonhereditary disease rarely occur men young age 40 . There large difference incidence geography race . The high rate see among African-American men United States . Also , although Caucasians low rate disease incidence mortality United States , rate among high compare rate European country . The reason difference well understood , environmental genetic risk factor think involve . Patients age 40 80 year prostate cancer confirm within past 6 month , reside Baltimore City adjacent metropolitan county , bear United States may eligible study . They recruit collaboration Departments Pathology Urology University Maryland Baltimore Veterans Affairs Medical Center . Those men serve control study identify Department Motor Vehicles database match age race patient cancer . The study include 600 participant prostate cancer 600 participant control group . Trained interviewer administer two questionnaire . The primary questionnaire use assess information medical cancer history , tobacco use , current medication , occupational history , family medical history , socioeconomic status . A supplemental questionnaire pertain patient ' exposure risk factor prostate cancer . It assess human body , diet , medical history , family medical history , sexual history . The section sexual history self-administered . Patients undergo collection blood urine various test . For cancer patient prostate surgery , also collection tissue , perform time prostate gland schedule surgical removal . The pattern gene expression analyze low- high-stage tumor . There direct benefit participate study , participant receive incentive $ 75 participate study . No form treatment involve study . However , hop study finding improve researcher ' understand prostate cancer biology respect cause health variance African-Americans Caucasians .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Epidemiological Study Genetic Risk Factors Prostate Cancer African-American Caucasian Males</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We conduct epidemiological prostate cancer case-control study Baltimore , Maryland . Participants African American Caucasian male reside Baltimore city surround area . The study ongoing recruit 1000 prostate cancer case 1000 population-based control . The case recruit two Baltimore hospital , Veterans Affairs Medical Center University Maryland Center . Cases pathologically confirm prostate cancer . The population-based control identify Maryland Department Motor Vehicle Database , frequency-matched age race case . Enrollment control start concurrently case accrual . The first 12 month study constitute pilot study , evaluate recruitment procedure . The study involve administration two questionnaire collection blood study subject . The two questionnaire consist main questionnaire supplemental questionnaire . The questionnaire evaluate family cancer history , tobacco use , medication , occupational history , socioeconomic status risk factor prostate cancer . Fresh-frozen tumor specimen obtain cancer patient available . The study support epidemiological infrastructure develop resource contractor University Maryland lung cancer case-control study . This lung cancer study ongoing , control recruit prostate cancer study joint control lung cancer study . Hence , population-based male control recruit contractor double eligibility concurrent lung prostate cancer study . To achieve age race match case control prostate study , over-sample male control lung study . We test primary hypothesis gene environmental exposure , include infection medical history , interaction exposure genetic factor modify prostate cancer susceptibility . As secondary goal , study gene expression profile prostate tumor identify change tumor biology associate exposure genetic environmental risk factor . It focus research identify mechanism tumor biology may cause aggressive nature prostate cancer African American men .</detailed_description>
