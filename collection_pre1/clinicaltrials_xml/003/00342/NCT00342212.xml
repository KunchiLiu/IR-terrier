	<brief_summary>Background : - Good measure physical activity need study correlate physical activity risk develop certain disease . - In preparation use study disease risk factor Hispanic population , NCI evaluate new model accelerometer measure physical activity . An accelerometer small device wear belt waist measure record movement , capture movement intensity duration associate clock-time . - The new accelerometer ( ActiGraph GTIM ) use different type motion detector use previous model ( ActiGraph 7164 ) . Objective : To evaluate compare ActiGraph GTIM ActiGraph 7164 collect physical activity data use model . Eligibility : Men woman 18-74 year age . Design : Study participant wear model accelerometer walk jog around track several self-selected pace . Data two device compare .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The NCI collaborate NIH Institutes propose extramurally fund longitudinal study Hispanic subpopulation United States refer Hispanic Community Health Study ( HCHS ) . Hispanic population understudied respect many disease risk factor . To good understand relationship physical activity chronic disease , make specific activity prescription , good method need improve validity reliability physical activity assessment instrument assess frequency , duration , intensity physical activity . In preparation use HCHS , NCI plan evaluate new type accelerometer , small device wear belt waist measure record movement , capture movement intensity duration associate clock-time . This new accelerometer use HCHS allow examination level well pattern activity . Physical activity measure accelerometer nationally representative 2003-2006 National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) . Between time NHANES HCHS , change technology accelerometer use NHANES . To allow comparison physical activity data collect HCHS data collect previous technology use NHANES , cross-validation study need . The propose study , ActiGraph Accelerometer Validation Study , compare ActiGraph model 7164 use NHANES new model GT1M use HCHS simultaneously collect physical activity data use ActiGraphs different circumstance walk jogging . The study recruit 120 men woman age 18-74 , correspond age range HCHS . Normal weight , overweight obese participant include age/gender cell . Because device measure movement , essential study participant particular ethnic group . To derive comparable data 2 device , 2 accelerometer model wear belt , one position hip . Study participant ask walk/jog around track know distance several self-selected pace . Minute-by-minute summary data two device evaluate comparability .</detailed_description>
