	<brief_summary>A population-based study initiate Costa Rica June 1993 investigate natural history human papillomaviruses ( HPV ) cervical neoplasia . Over period 18 month , end December 1994 , 10,080 woman recruit study , inform consent obtain . At initial recruitment visit , woman administer brief risk factor questionnaire , 15ml blood collect , sexually active , give pelvic examination . At time pelvic examination , Pap smear collect , additional cervical cell use additional monolayer smear ( ThinPrep ) human papillomavirus test . Pictures cervix , know cervigrams , also take third screening test . Based screening test , woman refer colposcopy , time detail risk factor questionnaire administer , additional cervical cell blood ( 15ml ) collect , histological specimen obtain , indicated colposcopy . Women diagnose high-grade cervical lesion ( HSIL ) cervical cancer treat Social Security Administration clinicians use standard local protocol . Women without evidence HSIL cancer enrollment comprise group subject follow part longitudinal study . Three distinct group woman approximately equal size ( 3,000 woman ) exist within longitudinal cohort . The first group consist woman enrollment evidence low-grade cervical lesion ( LSIL ) equivocal lesion sample remain cohort member . This group follow actively 6-12 month interval seventh anniversary cohort . The second group consist woman cytologically normal enrollment randomly select active follow-up . This second group see enrollment , fifth anniversary cohort . Women group evidence LSIL fifth anniversary visit add first group describe follow 6-month interval . The final group consist remain woman cohort ( cytologically normal enrollment ) . These woman follow passively via linkage cytology tumor registries Cost Rica . Clinical visit conduct follow-up consist brief personal interview collect information exposure since enrollment , collection 15ml blood , pelvic examination . Pap smear prepare pelvic examination , additional cervical specimen collect use prepare monolayer smear ( ThinPrep ) human papillomavirus test . Similar enrollment visit , cervigrams also collect participant time follow-up visit . During follow-up , woman evidence progression HSIL cancer ( Pap smear , ThinPrep , cervicography , visual inspection ) refer colposcopy , censor study , treat Social Security Administration clinicians use standard local protocol .</brief_summary>
