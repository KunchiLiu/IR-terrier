	<brief_summary>Age-related macular degeneration ( ARMD ) affect old Americans lead irreversible blindness . Although cause ARMD unclear , appear condition affect genetic environmental influence . The purpose study examine Amish community investigate genetic factor development ARMD . Study participants 1,000 member , age 50 older , Old Order Amish community Lancaster Franklin county Pennsylvania . Each undergo 30-minute dilate eye exam ophthalmologist optometrist take digital image macula optic disc . Depending result eye exam , participant may ask give blood sample well . They also complete brief questionnaire personal exposure relate occupation , sunlight smoking .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) lead cause visual impairment United States . Available evidence suggest AMD complex disorder significant genetic component well potential environmental influence . In study propose examine 3,000 member , age 50 older , Old Order Amish community Lancaster Franklin county area Pennsylvania . We plan detail epidemiology AMD population isolate attempt elucidate genetic factor may confer susceptibility predispose Amish individual family develop AMD . All study participant agree enroll provide informed consent undergo complete , dilate eye examination digital stereo image macula optic disc region acquire . Study participant also ask complete brief questionnaire inquire personal exposure relate occupation , sunlight , smoking . AMD determine independent reading digital fundus photograph University Wisconsin Fundus Photography Reading Center accord AREDS AMD classification scheme . We employ standard statistical genetics method parametric non-parametric linkage analysis , association analysis , transmission disequilibrium test , allowance environmental ( i.e . non-genetic ) factor determine identify candidate region candidate gene predispose Amish individual increase risk AMD . Ultimately , hope follow region show suggestive evidence linkage genome-wide scan fine mapping region , lead eventual clone sequence gene gene .</detailed_description>
