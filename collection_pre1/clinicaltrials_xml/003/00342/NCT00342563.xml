	<brief_title>Treatment With Mecamylamine Smoking Non-smoking Alcohol Dependent Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RESEARCH PLAN : Although two FDA approve medication treatment alcohol dependence ( naltrexone disulfiram ) , robust efficacy compound reduce alcohol consumption recently call question . Given high rate alcohol dependence among general population , development test novel medication great importance . Mecamylamine , noncompetitive NACh receptor antagonist show useful smoking cessation use combination transdermal nicotine . To knowledge , clinical study examine effectiveness mecamylamine alcoholism conduct . However , evidence animal research mecamylamine block effect alcohol . Infusion mecamylamine ventral tegmental area antagonize ethanol-induced dopamine release rat . More importantly , mecamylamine decrease alcohol intake preference alcohol-preferring rat . In two study healthy volunteer mecamylamine effective attenuate euphoric effect alcohol reduce crave alcohol . This first study design test clinical efficacy mecamylamine sample alcohol dependent patient either smoke . For propose project recruit 60 treatment seek patient age 18 60 meet criterion alcohol dependence may may smoke . Patients randomize two group ( 30 patient group ) : one dose mecamylamine ( 10mg ) placebo double-blind fashion 12 week . Patients ask come follow 3 month complete study . Patients exclude : take medication think influence drink behavior , significant underlying medical condition , cerebral , renal , thyroid , hepatic cardiac pathology ; history glaucoma , prostatic hypertrophy , urethral obstruction , cerebral arteriosclerosis , pyloric stenosis , history hypersensitivity mecamylamine ; meet current criterion Bipolar Disorders , Schizophrenia Schizophrenia-type Disorders , Major Depression Posttraumatic Stress Disorders ( PTSD ) . Females pregnant lactating also exclude . We hypothesize mecamylamine result great reduction alcohol consumption placebo among alcohol dependent patient . We hypothesize mecamylamine effective reduce alcohol consumption smoke subgroup alcoholic also smoke .</detailed_description>
