	<detailed_description>Background : Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( OSA ) common sleep disorder associate serious medical psychological complication . Nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) treatment choice condition highly effective reduce frequency nocturnal respiratory event , improve sleep architecture , decrease daytime sleepiness improve blood pressure . Incomplete patient adherence , however , limit effectiveness CPAP therapy result sub-optimal patient outcome . Previous effort enhance CPAP adherence result modest improvement , generally theory-driven , minimal effect key patient outcome reduction OSA symptoms increase health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) . The plan intervention proposal , Sleep Apnea Self-Management Program ( SASMP ) , base rationale sleep apnea chronic disease require significant self-care part patient . We draw extensive chronic disease self-management literature provide solid theoretical justification pragmatic intervention well manage key aspect OSA increase CPAP adherence . Chronic disease management program help reduce symptom , improve HRQOL , improve treatment adherence , decrease medical utilization . Objectives : The primary aim study compare efficacy SASMP Usual Care improve OSA symptom status , HRQOL , self-reported medical utilization . A second aim examine extent change symptoms HRQOL mediate change self-efficacy CPAP adherence . Methods : We evaluate Sleep Apnea Self-Management Program ( SASMP ) conduct randomize , controlled trial program compare Usual Care patient diagnose OSA prescribe CPAP therapy . Participants randomize SASMP group attend 4 weekly educational session 2.5 hour . Two trained leader facilitate program script manual . Key topic cover program include 1 ) management OSA symptom , CPAP side effect , weight loss ; 2 ) maintain social contact family relationship ; 3 ) deal symptoms depression worry future . Findings : No result time . Status : We currently engage start-up activity . Impact : The result project improve service delivery improve health outcome sleep apnea patient Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System , throughout VA , well community base sleep clinic .</detailed_description>
