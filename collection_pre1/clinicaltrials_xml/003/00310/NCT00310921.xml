	<brief_title>A Randomized Study Cervical Priming With Misoprostol Prior Elective First Trimester Pregnancy Termination</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous study suggest cervical priming misoprostol may facilitate vacuum aspiration first trim termination induce cervical dilation . This medication use routinely abortion clinic , others use sporadically Kaiser facility . The present study design investigate whether use misoprostol noticeably improve clinical experience . We determine whether use misoprostol compare placebo first trimester abortion 1 ) positively impact rating pain experience patient , 2 ) positively impact physician ’ rating regard difficulty procedure , 3 ) reduces complication . Misoprostol effective cervical prim prior vacuum aspiration first trim pregnancy termination.2 Previous study examine dose3,4 , route administration ( oral5 vaginal6,7 ) time interval allow maximum dilation limit side effect bleed prior procedure.8,9,10 There evidence support specific dose , route time interval.10 Previous study also examine amount bleeding , length procedure , force use dilate cervix , cervical dilation mm.10 However , unknown whether statistically significant change translate clinically relevant change . For example , Ngai et al.10 report blood loss significantly decrease . However , mean blood loss differ 68 ml . It widely accept surgical procedure difference 68 ml blood change patient ’ hematocrit postoperative clinical course . In study preoperative baseline cervical dilation 1.7 mm different , also find statistically significant evidence difference change clinical experience either physician patient . All previous study review also perform patient general anesthesia patient ’ perception pain examine . Because majority first trim termination U.S. do patient awake , important consider pain .</detailed_description>
