	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study best individual therapy woman node-negative , estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer use special test ( Oncotype DX ) , whether hormone therapy alone hormone therapy together combination chemotherapy well woman Oncotype DX recurrence score 11-25 . Estrogen cause growth breast cancer cell . Hormone therapy may fight breast cancer block use estrogen tumor cell lower amount estrogen body make . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving hormone therapy together one chemotherapy drug ( combination chemotherapy ) show reduce chance breast cancer recurrence , benefit add chemotherapy hormone therapy woman node-negative , estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer small . New test may provide information patient likely benefit chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether adjuvant hormonal therapy inferior adjuvant chemohormonal woman whose tumor meet established clinical guideline adjuvant chemotherapy fall `` primary study group '' category ( Oncotype DX Recurrence Score 11-25 ) . II . To create tissue specimen bank patient enrolled trial , include formalin fix paraffin embed tumor specimen , tissue microarrays , plasma , deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) obtain peripheral blood . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether adjuvant hormonal therapy sufficient treatment ( i.e . 10 year distant disease-free survival least 95 % ) woman whose tumor meet established clinical guideline adjuvant chemotherapy fall `` Secondary Study Group-1 '' category ( Oncotype DX Recurrence Score = &lt; 10 ) . II . To compare outcomes project 10 year Adjuvant ( outcomes project use classical pathologic information include tumor size , hormone receptor status , histologic grade ) make Genomic Health Oncotype DX test . Classical pathologic information outcome result also use create refine model would use classical information instead combination genomic test . III . To estimate failure rate function recurrence score ( RS ) separately chemotherapy ( arm C , D ) chemotherapy ( arm A , B ) group . The purpose analysis develop precise estimate relationship recurrence score chemotherapy treatment effect , , upper range RS 11 - 25 group . IV . To determine prognostic significance Oncotype DX recurrence score individual RS gene group ( proliferation gene group , human epidermal growth factor receptor [ HER ] 2 gene group , estrogen receptor [ ER ] gene group , invasion gene group , gene ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect chemotherapy hormonal therapy v hormonal therapy alone perceive cognitive impairment , fatigue , fear recurrence among pre-menopausal patient , endocrine symptom sexual dysfunction , overall health-related quality life ( HRQL ) . II . To determine whether perceived cognitive impairment , fatigue , fear recurrence , endocrine symptom , overall HRQL similar patient receive chemotherapy plus hormonal therapy secondary study group 2 primary study group ( arm D v C ) . III . To determine whether perceived cognitive impairment , fatigue , fear recurrence , endocrine symptom , overall HRQL similar patient receive hormonal therapy alone secondary study group 1 primary study group ( arm A v B ) . IV . To determine whether age inversely associate fear recurrence , independent treatment assignment . V. Among participant receive hormonal treatment alone arm A arm B , determine whether Oncotype DX Recurrence score inversely correlate fear recurrence . VI . To create biospecimen repository include plasma , serum CellSearch cassettes contain circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) evaluate determinant late relapse , include candidate biomarkers reflect occult tumor burden ( e.g. , CTCs plasma tumor DNA ) host factor ( e.g. , estrogen , insulin growth factor- [ IGF ] axis , inflammation , etc ) . VII . To create biorepository metastatic tumor sample patient late relapse . VIII . To determine body mass index ( BMI ) comorbidity burden patient operable breast cancer five year diagnosis . IX . To determine whether relationship late relapse BMI diagnosis 5 year diagnosis , whether BMI-associated inflammatory and/or metabolic biomarkers associate early late recurrence . OUTLINE : This partially randomize study . Patients assign 1 3 treatment group . GROUP 1 ( SECONDARY STUDY GROUP 1 ; ONCOTYPE DX RECURRENCE SCORE [ ODRS ] = &lt; 10 ) : Patients receive standard hormonal therapy ( e.g. , tamoxifen alone orally ( PO ) , aromatase inhibitor [ e.g. , anastrozole , letrozole , exemestane ] alone PO , tamoxifen PO follow aromatase inhibitor PO ) discretion treat physician 5 10 year . GROUP 2 ( PRIMARY STUDY GROUP ; ODRS 11-25 ) : Patients randomize receive either hormonal therapy alone combination chemotherapy hormonal therapy . ARM I ( EXPERIMENTAL ) : Patients receive hormonal therapy Group 1 discretion treat physician . ARM II ( STANDARD ) : Patients receive standard combination chemotherapy discretion treat physician . Within 4 week last dose chemotherapy , patient receive hormonal therapy Group 1 discretion treat physician . GROUP 3 ( SECONDARY STUDY GROUP 2 ; ODRS &gt; = 26 ) : Patients receive combination chemotherapy Group 2 , Arm II follow hormonal therapy Group 1 . Patients group breast-conservation surgery also treat radiotherapy . Radiotherapy begin within 4 week registration patient receive hormonal therapy alone within 8 week completion chemotherapy . Patients participate National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Bowel Project ( NSABP ) and/or Radiation Therapy Oncology Group ( RTOG ) partial irradiation trial ( ) may receive partial breast radiation . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3-6 month 5 year annually 15 year .</detailed_description>
