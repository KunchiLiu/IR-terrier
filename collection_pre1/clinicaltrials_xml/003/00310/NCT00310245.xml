	<detailed_description>Study objectives Primary objective study : To compare efficacy ( clinical immunological ) safety continue conventional HAART chronically infect HIV patient therapeutic strategy base long term , immunologically drive treatment interruption . To verify risk develop viral resistance Secondary objective : To verify effect two strategy metabolic parameter To verify possibility steadily discontinue antiretroviral therapy patient start baseline immunological value higher currently recommend international guideline HIV treatment To identify predictive variable possibility safely discontinue antiretroviral therapy To verify dynamic CD4 + loss HIV replication treatment interruption To verify cost connect strategy Inclusion exclusion criterion . Inclusion . Age &gt; 17 year ii . Informed consent sign iii . Effective ongoing treatment ( HIV-RNA &lt; 50 copies/ml ) . Treatment must base triple drug therapy . Patients must steady therapy least 3 month . iv . Current CD4 cell count 800 cells/mcL b. Exclusion i. Childbearing breastfeeding . Women childbearing potential ask adopt effective contraceptive method behavior ii . Any ongoing grade 4 ( WHO ) AE laboratory abnormality exclusion cholesterol , triglyceride grade 3 ( AHA ) level consider exclusion criterion . As study want enroll patient strictly reflect population HIV infected individual , previous mono dual therapy well presence co-morbidities HBV HCV co-infection constitute exclusion criterion , record Study design This randomize , control , open , comparative study . The trial follow-up 4 year . Patients monitor accord international local guideline HIV infection far time type laboratory clinical control . Laboratory exam decide locally key test require study . The timing laboratory evaluation 1 2 month treatment interruption thereafter every 2 month . All data store computerized data-base . Study arm management study Patients randomize ratio 1 : 2 one follow treatment arm : 1 . Continuing ongoing HAART ( control ) 2 . Long term treatment interruption ( STI ) Randomization accomplish locally accord pre-determined , computer-generated random list . In control group , patient allow change therapy virological , toxicological personal reason well comply new indication international guideline . All variation record . Patients change therapy still include ITT analysis , consider failure AT analysis . Patients stop therapy , reason resume within 3 month consider failure AT analysis In STI arm , patient stay therapy CD4 count drop &lt; 400 cells/mcL ( one measurement consider sufficient ) . At time point patient resume HAART regimen assume STI period ( unless judge choice accord new international guideline ) continue HAART CD4 count raise &gt; 800 cells/mcL plasma HIV-RNA drop detection limit 50 copies/ml ( one measurement consider sufficient ) . When CD4 count viral load within pre-set value stop therapy . There limit number interruption re-start cycle study period 100 patient allocate STI arm 30 patient control arm . End point evaluation criteria The primary end-points evaluation main objective study divide short term end point long term end point : The primary short term outcome measure proportion subject maintain time-point ( every 4 month ) CD4 + cell count 400 cells/mcL . The trial power calculate end point . On long term , primary outcome measure base occurrence clinical end-points include : disease progression define occurrence AIDS define event death . The occurrence grade 4 ( WHO ) adverse event limit possibility maintain patient randomize arm also consider AT analysis . Virologic failure selection resistance confer mutation second long-term primary end-point . Genotypic test perform case HIV-RNA &gt; 1000 copies/ml therapy least 6 month ( either group ) . The secondary objective study evaluate basis : Mean variation blood cholesterol triglycerides baseline value . For parameter proportion subject value grade 2 ( AHA ) also use evaluation criterion . Development lipodystrophy modification pre-existing lipodystrophy Time therapy Economic evaluation Genotypic test perform case HIV-RNA &gt; 1000 copies/ml therapy least 4 month one month treatment interruption . Duration study Treatment continue 4 year study condition . Patients complete study period still respond therapy keep regimen . Statistical evaluation study perform yearly . Monitoring Laboratory test study period perform fasting state . The following test procedure require record electronic data base . It also advise perform regular basis haemogram , renal function test , blood glucose amylase . Other test could perform accord local need particular situation relate specific management single patient : Baseline ( patient ) . Informed consent treatment randomization ii . Biochemical analysis : ALT , AST , total cholesterol HDL , triglycerides iii . CD4 count , CD8 count iv . Plasma HIV-RNA v. Clinical evaluation , anamnestic demographic data : sex , age , risk factor HIV infection , CDC AIDS classification , time ART , time current HAART , previous antiretroviral drug , previous sub-optimal ARTs , current antiretroviral drug , presence grade lipodystrophy , time HIV-RNA detection , nadir CD4 , CD4 start antiretroviral therapy 1. month STI ( STI group ) i. CD4 count , CD8 count , HIV-RNA 2. month STI ( STI group ) i. Biochemical analysis : ALT , AST , cholesterol ( total HDL ) , triglycerides ii . CD4 count , CD8 count iii . Plasma HIV-RNA , Genotype iv . Clinical evaluation : disease progression , lipodystrophy assessment Every 2 month thereafter ( STI group control group ) i. Biochemical analysis : ALT , AST , cholesterol ( total HDL ) , triglycerides ii . CD4 count , CD8 count iii . Plasma HIV-RNA iv . Clinical evaluation : disease progression , lipodystrophy assessment Additional test Additional test request specific case : i. second genotype 4 month initiation STI period perform patient show major mutation genotype perform 2 month STI start ii . genotype perform patient either STI control group show viral load 1000 copies/ml continuous treatment period ( drug ) &gt; 5 month . Statistical consideration The study power evaluate equivalence two strategy assumption failure proportion control arm time point great 5 % maximum allow difference 15 % . Equivalence define basis 95 % confidence interval . According hypothesis alfa = 5 % 1-beta = 80 % minimum 70 patient need . The primary analysis make accord intention-to-treat approach therefore correction eventual drop out need . In addition , secondary per-protocol analysis perform . The primary outcome measure ( proportion patient CD4 + cell count 400 cells/mcL ) analyze mean Chi-square Fisher ’ exact test use analyze categorical variable , . Time treatment failure estimate use Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimate ( present graphically ) . The log-rank test use ass difference survival curve arm , ANOVA test Student ’ test use continuous variable unless variable normally distribute , case Mann-Whitney U test use . Logistic regression analysis ( forward stepwise model ) use evaluate relationship variables outcome . Comparisons pair group bee perform case multiple test yield statistically significant result . All test two-sided P value inferior 0.05 regard significant . The analysis data perform propose Study Center SPSS statistical software package Windows , version 10.0 . Drugs This spontaneous study . It propose drug dispense accord standard procedure . Data use Data use scientific purpose . The analysis perform yearly . The type timing publication data agree among participant study . The authorship presentation agree among participant . All participant acknowledge member study group .</detailed_description>
