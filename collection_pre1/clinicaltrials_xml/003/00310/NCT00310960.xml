	<brief_summary>The purpose study : - To estimate duration misalignment age presentation infantile esotropia ( infantile ET ) , acquire non-accommodative esotropia ( ANAET ) acquire partially accommodative esotropia ( APAET ) . - To determine proportion patient angle instability infantile ET , ANAET APAET length follow-up .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Observational Study Infantile , Acquired Non-accommodative , Acquired Partially-accommodative Esotropia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately one third infant infantile esotropia ( infantile ET ) similar proportion child acquire non-accommodative esotropia ( ANAET ) increase angle within first month initial examination . In approximately two third patient , angle misalignment remain stable small proportion , angle esotropia decrease . The change angle misalignment significant proportion child esotropia raise important question regard time surgical management child : surgery undertaken immediately delay alignment stabilizes ? Early surgery may improve sensory outcome ; delay surgery may improve surgical dose accuracy motor outcome . Children acquire partially accommodative esotropia ( APAET ) may differ infantile ET ANAET tend present old age , likely preserve high-grade stereopsis appropriate treatment , require surgical intervention less frequently , substantial hyperopic refractive error . Little known regard early angle stability group patient follow correction refractive error . Although need randomize trial address issue time surgery infantile ET , APAET , ANAET , prior design trial , high-quality preliminary data need . We propose multi-center observational study 1 ) determine duration misalignment infantile ET , ANAET , APAET study enrollment , 2 ) prospectively establish proportion patient angle instability infantile ET , ANAET , APAET , 3 ) determine recruitment potential randomize trial . These data crucial sample size calculation eventual randomize trial , help define clinical characteristic condition . A concurrent nest ancillary study conduct select center collect test-retest data alignment measurement estimate amount measurement variability . These test-retest data use define change angle alignment exceed amount could reasonably due measurement error , use evaluate proportion patient angle instability current study . Eligible patient infantile ET consent enrolled initial visit . Infantile ET patient need spectacle prescribe spectacle return Infantile ET Spectacle Baseline Visit 2 week later . ANAET APAET patient present wear spectacle appropriate correction least 2 week consent enrolled study initial visit . For ANAET APAET patient present wear spectacle : - Patients need spectacle consent enrol study initial visit . - Patients need spectacle prescribe appropriate correction investigator intend offer patient enrollment later date . Patients ask return wear new spectacle 2-6 week , time may consent enrol study . Sample Size : The study enroll 100 patient three esotropia type infantile ET , ANAET , APAET , total 300 patient .</detailed_description>
