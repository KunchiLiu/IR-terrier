	<detailed_description>This single-center , randomize , open-label , dose-ranging , phase I comparative trial intradermal ( ID ) intramuscular ( IM ) injection subvirion inactivate influenza A/H5N1 vaccine healthy adult , 18 40 year old , inclusive . This study design investigate safety , reactogenicity , dose-related immunogenicity investigational inactivated influenza A/H5N1 virus vaccine give ID injection compare IM injection . The primary objective study : compare dose-related safety reactogenicity profile ID IM injection subvirion inactivate influenza A/H5N1 vaccine among healthy young adult ; compare dose-related immunogenicity subvirion inactivate influenza A/H5N1 vaccine give ID vaccine give IM injection among healthy young adult 1 month receipt second dose vaccine ; provide information selection best dose level study . The secondary objective study : evaluate dose-related immunogenicity percent subject respond approximately 1 7 month first vaccination ; evaluate dose-related safety , reactogenicity immunogenicity follow receipt third dose vaccine administer 6-7 month second dose vaccine . The study 2 comparison arm ( IM ID ) , 2 dosage level evaluate arm ( 4 vaccine group total ) . Subjects randomized 1:1:1:1 ( 25 subject group ) receive 2 dos 1 month apart inactivate influenza A/H5N1 vaccine contain 15 mcg 45 mcg H5 HA IM route ; one-fifth IM dose ( 3 mcg 9 mcg ) ID route . Subjects maintain memory aid record oral temperature , systemic local adverse event 7 day inoculation . Serum immunogenicity evaluation obtain prior first vaccination , Day 0 , prior second vaccination , Day 28 , Day 56 approximately Day 215 ( 7 month ) dose 1 . This study link DMID protocol 07-0022 .</detailed_description>
