	<brief_summary>We seek develop advanced image approach identify localize prostate cancer . We believe high field MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) potential endeavor prove patient prostate cancer pre-operatively undergo technique call magnetic resonance spectroscopy . After surgery , microscopic location cancer compare pre-operative image assess well image technique succeed .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinico-pathologic Correlative Study 3T Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Localization Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose research enormously relevant clinical understand early prostate cancer . We propose test see whether characteristic pattern invivo 3T MRSI associate metabolite identify correlation clinically active tumor reserve histopathologic analysis resect specimen . We also plan demonstrate 3T MR spectra prostate cancer allow detail metabolic assessment high sensitivity , specificity accuracy publish result establish MR spectra use 1.5T MR unit . Functional imaging ( eg . molecular imaging ) felt clinical wave future cancer imaging , successful , assume major role detection , assessment , treatment planning delivery drug , radiation , heat novel therapeutic fight prostate cancer .</detailed_description>
