	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well bortezomib work give combination chemotherapy , rituximab , autologous stem cell transplant treat patient mantle cell lymphoma . Bortezomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) together autologous stem cell transplant may allow chemotherapy give cancer cell kill . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Giving bortezomib combination chemotherapy , monoclonal antibody therapy , autologous stem cell transplant may kill remain cancer cell keep cancer come back .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives Primary Objective : To determine 18-month progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma treat aggressive chemo-immunotherapy autologous stem cell transplant follow randomization either maintenance consolidation bortezomib therapy Secondary Objectives : - To determine toxicity profile maintenance consolidation bortezomib evaluate number patient able complete maintenance consolidation therapy - To determine complete response rate intensive chemo-immunotherapy plus maintenance consolidation bortezomib - To determine time progression overall survival use two treatment regimen - To determine importance p53 mutation deletion patient outcome respect CR rate , PFS , OS - To determine importance Ki67 , cyclin D1 , phosphohistone 3 , p27 , p21 , p16 , PARP p85 expression pre-treatment tumor biopsy respect CR rate , PFS , OS - To determine relationship proliferation signature clinical outcome use quantitative real-time RT-PCR - To evaluate importance quantitative cyclin D1 expression expression cyclin D1 isoforms predict clinical outcome use quantitative real-time RT-PCR - To evaluate prognostic significance microRNAs mantle cell lymphoma use microRNA arras - To explore correlation select microRNA polymorphism gene target expression clinical outcome response , PFS , OS - To determine change gene expression profile diagnosis relapse sample identify gene differentially silence over-expressed disease recurrence - To determine importance early PCR negativity ( follow Treatment 2 ) use bcl-1/IgH junction and/or IgH chain gene rearrangement respect maintain PFS success maintenance consolidation therapy convert patient PCR negative status OUTLINE OF INTERVENTIONS : CHEMOIMMUNOTHERAPY : Patients receive chemoimmunotherapy comprise rituximab* intravenously ( IV ) 4-6 hour day 1 , methotrexate ( MTX ) IV 4 hour day 2 , cyclophosphamide IV 2 hour , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV , vincristine sulfate IV day 3 , prednisone orally ( PO ) day 3-7 . Beginning 24 hour completion MTX , patient receive leucovorin calcium IV every 6 hour blood level MTX safe range . Patients also receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SC ) daily ( QD ) begin day 3 continue blood count recover . Beginning sooner day 22 , later day 29 first course , patient receive second course chemoimmunotherapy . Patients &gt; 15 % persistent bone marrow involvement may receive third course chemoimmunotherapy . Patients restaged progressive disease remove therapy . NOTE : *During first course chemoimmunotherapy , patient receive rituximab number circulate mantle cell = &lt; 10,000/mm^3 , otherwise , rituximab omit first course chemoimmunotherapy . HIGH-DOSE CONSOLIDATION CHEMOIMMUNOTHERAPY AND PERIPHERAL BLOOD STEM CELL ( PBSC ) COLLECTION : Approximately 4 week completion chemoimmunotherapy , patient receive high-dose consolidation chemoimmunotherapy comprise cytarabine IV 2 hour etoposide phosphate IV continuously day 1-4 , rituximab IV 4-6 hour day 5 12 OR 6 13 . Beginning day 14 continue completion PBSC collection , patient receive G-CSF SC QD . Once blood count recover , patient undergo 1-3 leukapheresis procedure collection PBSCs day 22-25 . HIGH-DOSE CHEMOTHERAPY AND AUTOLOGOUS PBSC TRANSPLANTATION ( PBSCT ) : Beginning 4-6 week completion leukapheresis , patient receive carmustine IV 2 hour day -6 , etoposide phosphate IV 4 hour day -4 , cyclophosphamide IV 2 hour day -2 . Patients undergo autologous PBSCT day 0 . Patients also receive G-CSF SC QD begin day 4 continue blood count recover . POST-TRANSPLANTATION IMMUNOTHERAPY : Approximately 5 week autologous PBSCT , patient receive rituximab IV 4-6 hour weekly 2 week . Approximately 4 week completion post-transplantation immunotherapy , patient proceed maintenance therapy consolidation therapy bortezomib describe Arms section . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually 5 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Documentation Disease A. Histologic Documentation : Histologically document mantle cell lymphoma coexpression CD20 ( CD19 ) CD5 lack CD23 expression immunophenotyping AND least one follow confirmatory test : positive immunostaining cyclin D1 ; OR presence ( 11 ; 14 ) cytogenetic analysis ; OR molecular evidence bcl1/IgH rearrangement . Cases CD5negative and/or CD23positive eligible provide histopathology consistent mantle cell lymphoma AND positive cyclin D1 , ( 11 ; 14 ) , bcl1/IgH rearrangement.A tissue block submit CALGB Pathology Coordinating Office central pathology review . A diagnosis base peripheral blood bone marrow allow . If diagnosis base blood , addition immunophenotype molecular confirmation , peripheral blood smear must available central pathology review . If diagnosis base bone marrow biopsy , tissue block submit . Note : Failure submit pathology material within 60 day patient registration consider major protocol violation . B . Extent Disease : Stage IIV . Patients nodular histology mantle cell lymphoma must Ann Arbor stage III IV disease eligible . Patients mantle zone histology eligible relatively favorable prognosis .
