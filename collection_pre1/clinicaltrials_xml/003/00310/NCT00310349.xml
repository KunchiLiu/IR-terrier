	<detailed_description>PneuMum randomise control trial aim find pneumococcal vaccination Australian Indigenous mother , last month pregnancy delivery , prevent ear disease infant . Two vaccine use trial : - The 23 valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( 23vPPV ) , currently recommend Indigenous people Northern Territory 15 year age uptake among woman child-bearing age low . - Adult diphtheria , tetanus acellular pertussis vaccine ( dTPa ) use control vaccine . This vaccine recommend new parent previously immunise currently fund would normally need purchase prescription pharmacist . Rationale Indigenous child experience high rate acute chronic ear infection world , result permanent ear damage , hear loss educational disadvantage . These infection mainly bacterial . Streptococcus pneumoniae ( pneumococcus ) predominant pathogen . Pneumococcal colonisation infection begin within day birth , month potential immunological protection infant pneumococcal conjugate vaccine may expect . New strategy need eliminate , least delay , early-onset pneumococcal colonisation . Maternal vaccination 23 valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( 23vPPV ) pregnancy delivery one strategy may protect newborn infant mechanisms transplacental antibody transfer , increase secretory antibody breast milk , and/or reduce nasopharyngeal carriage ( transmission infant ) maternal pneumococcus . Previous small study use strategy encouraging , study properly evaluate nasopharyngeal carriage disease endpoints infant . Methods We hope recruit 210 Indigenous woman age 18-39 year uncomplicated pregnancy . Following recruitment , subject randomly assign one three group : - Group A receive 23vPPV last month pregnancy - Group B receive 23vPPV soon childbirth - Group C receive 23vPPV seven month childbirth ( control group ) . Women Groups A C receive dTPa soon childbirth ( conceal intervention group ) , whereas woman Group C offer dTpa seven month childbirth ( end observation period ) . Study participant visit least five time : 1 . During last month pregnancy ( 30-36 week gestation ) - The group mother receive 23vPPV visit also sample take blood 2 . At Royal Darwin Hospital baby born - Each mother receive either 23vPPV dTpa depend allocation - Each mother sample take blood , cord blood , nasopharyngeal swab sample express breast milk 3 . When baby one month old - Each baby ears checked nasopharyngeal swab take . A swab also take discharge baby 's ear/s . Mothers ask sample express breast milk . 4 . When baby two month old - The check sample previous month . 5 . When baby seven month old - Each mother baby check sample previous month . Babies also sample take blood . Mothers yet 23vPPV offer vaccine yet dTpa . Primary Outcome The primary outcome prevalence ear infection seven month age , define middle ear effusion tympanic membrane perforation acute otitis medium . Pneumatic otoscopy , video-otoscopy tympanometry use ear examination . The primary analysis direct comparison proportion infant control group ( Group C ) nasopharyngeal carriage vaccine type pneumococci seven month age compare infant two group similar comparison proportion middle ear disease .</detailed_description>
