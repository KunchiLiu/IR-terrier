	<brief_summary>This study examine brain make involuntary spasm contraction patient focal hand dystonia ( FHD ) . Patients dystonia muscle spasm cause uncontrolled twist repetitive movement abnormal posture . In FHD , hand involve . The study use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI , see ) study area brain primarily affect FHD well understand brain change produce dystonia symptom . Normal right-handed volunteer patient FHD 18-65 year age may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical neurological examination . Women become pregnant urine pregnancy test . All participant undergo fMRI . This test use strong magnetic field radio wave obtain image body organ tissue . The subject lie table move scanner ( metal cylinder ) , wear earplug muffle loud knock thump sound occur scan process . The procedure last 90 minute , time patient ask lie still 10-15 minute time . During procedure , subject ask perform task , include writing , tap hand , draw zigzag motion . Each task perform use right hand , leave hand right foot .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Writer 's cramp , form focal hand dystonia , frequently observe task specific dystonia . Symptoms writer 's cramp often appear soon pen pick , word write . Patients simple writer 's cramp difficulty write , carry task affect hand without spasm . Little known hand spasm writing , perform task normally . The purpose study identify brain area activation associate specifically task handwrite dystonic hand , patient simple writer 's cramp . Simple writer 's cramp define patient exhibit symptom write symptoms present task performance . Specifically study , patient able write 20 second consecutively run . We plan use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) identify pattern blood oxygenation level-dependent ( BOLD ) activation brain different task perform different limb healthy volunteer patient focal hand dystonia . Study Population : This research conduct use 22 patient diagnosed simple writer 's cramp 32 healthy volunteer match age gender . Design : Using block design functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) , examine brain activity patient healthy volunteer execute three task : writing , tap zigzag motion , three separate limb : dystonic hand , opposite hand , right foot . Outcome Measures : The change signal intensity brain activity correlate motor program ( task handwrite ) effector ( dystonic hand ) collect analyze . The finding expect obtain experiment may contribute basic knowledge linkage task specificity dystonic hand , may provide good understand pathophysiology writer 's cramp .</detailed_description>
