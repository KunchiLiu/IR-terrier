	<brief_summary>The aim randomize placebo-controlled study evaluate effect analgetics neuropathic pain mechanical hyperalgesia kind evoke pain . Therefore number responder non-responders pregabalin evaluate respect mechanical hyperalgesia ( stimulus-response-function ( SRF ) static punctual stimulus evoke pain determine via pinprick ) . The hypothesis placebo group amount non-responders increase .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize controlled trial intend first series trial assess efficacy drug , relieve neuropathic pain , stimulus-evoked pain ( : mechanical hyperalgesia static punctate stimulus ) . Most drug class ( e.g . Gabapentin NMDA receptor inhibitor ) NNT beyond 3 patient chronic pain , due response rate 30 50 % . One potential reason low overall efficacy might presence different pathophysiological mechanism subgroup patient , suffer disease ( e.g . postherpetic neuralgia , diabetic neuropathy ) . These mechanism may include central sensitization one hand peripheral degeneration afferent fiber hand . In trial , use battery mechanical thermal Quantitative Sensory Tests ( QST ) , use non-nociceptive low-intensity painful stimulus , identify subgroup patient mechanical hyperalgesia . To overcome well-known low response rate trial neuropathic pain patient , enrich design compare active drug placebo perform , include patient high intensity on-going pain combination mechanical hyperalgesia sequela different , well defined neurological disorder . The blinded phase trial restrict so-called responder , i.e . patient clinically meaningful pain reduction least 30 % primary end point ( mechanical hyperalgesia ) . The second objective trial evaluate , whether anti-hyperalgesic effect active drug dependent QST profile .</detailed_description>
