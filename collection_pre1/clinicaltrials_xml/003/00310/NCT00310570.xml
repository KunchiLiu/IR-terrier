	<brief_summary>Stubbing finger-tip common injury sport basketball , volleyball , cricket football . This result Mallet finger deformity , end joint finger actively straighten . In mallet finger case see The Alfred , skin remain intact , impairment result tear extensor tendon avulsion ( small fracture tendon attach bone ) . Treatment commonly involve immobilise end joint finger splint six week patient compliance major factor quality outcome achieve . This study aim compare two different type splintage ( commonly use thermoplastic thimble splint aluminium-foam “ Mexican hat ” splint use Britain ) control splint ( thermoplastic prefabricate “ stack splint ” tape ) . Outcome measure include patient compliance splint , degree extensor lag , active movement joint , complication . The null hypothesis difference outcome different method conservative splint treatment mallet finger .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Literature Review : Mallet finger define loss continuity distal insertion extensor tendon finger tip . It common hand injury ball sport ( McCue Garroway 1985 ) also occur minor incident bed-making trips/falls ( Abouna Brown , 1968 ) . The injury result droop distal inter-phalangeal joint , usually manage conservatively splint hyper-extension 6 week . This position allow relaxation tendon encourage heal bring torn end fracture fragment closer together heal phase . A recent Cochrane Systematic review evidence treat injury ( Handoll Vaghela , 2005 ) find insufficient evidence exist randomise controlled trial establish effectiveness different ( either custom-made off-the-shelf ) finger splint treat mallet finger injury . They comment 4 trial meet inclusion criterion , “ small , heterogeneous , inadequately describe reported….and methodological flaw ” . Evidence provide therefore inadequate base clinical decision making . 2 . Rationale project : If mallet injury manage correctly , patient leave persistent extension lag ( loss voluntary straighten ) swan neck deformity ( severe flexion deformity distal finger joint plus secondary hyperextension deformity proximal joint result imbalance extensor mechanism ) . Mallet injury relatively common , estimate 100 case treat Alfred last year , debate best approach management . The plastic surgery unit keen determine optimal treatment injury . The Cochrane systematic review ( Handoll Vaghela , 2005 ) find four relevant trial meet inclusion criterion , methodological flaw . As commonly present injury The Alfred , opportunity exists add evidence base conduct well-designed thorough trial compare two commonly advocate treatment suitable control . 3 . Hypothesis/research question : Null Hypothesis : There differences outcome different method conservative splint treatment mallet finger . 4 . Aims : To determine appropriate conservative treatment mallet finger injury . 5 . Methodology : We aim conduct randomise control trial 100 participant , base current referral hand therapy . Subjects allocate one follow group use randomise computer sequence : - Circumferential thermoplastic thimble splint , - dorsally apply aluminium-foam “ Mexican hat ” splint , - control splint ( off-the-shelf thermoplastic “ stack ” splint tape ) . NB consider unethical provide “ treatment ” control give amount extension loss expect untreated injury likelihood persistent finger deformity . All aspect treatment include frequency contact , duration initial period splintage , patient advice ( eg hygiene routine , exercise , splint donning/doffing ) remain across group . Baseline data : - age - gender - hand dominance - time since injury - type injury ( bony versus soft-tissue ) - degree extensor lag ( measure standardise goniometer ) - presence hand injury injure hand - smoker/non-smoker - medication - hand dominance - occupation hobby Progressive measurement ( take 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 20 week ) : - degree extensor lag ( measure standardise goniometer ) - development complication , whether change splint type require - patient adherence treatment protocol , base self-report . Patients provide simple diary complete record incidence removal adjustment splint , reason ( ) ( eg skin breakdown , poor splint fit , dislodge activity ) , time splint Outcome measure ( take 10 , 12 20 week ) : - degree extensor lag DIP - active range motion DIP - patient satisfaction result 5-point likert scale - pain , measure 10 point Visual Analogue Scale Blinding assessor : - progressive outcome measurement take separate assessor ( one current treat hand therapist ) train take measurement blind type splint use . To ensure , splint remove prior assessment re-applied afterwards Allied Health Assistant use standard donning/doffing technique . 6 . Inclusion/exclusion criterion : All referral patient mallet finger injury consider inclusion exception follow exclusion criterion : - open injury ( skin breach ) - mallet injury thumb - co-existing rheumatologic illness - time injury presentation great 2 week 7 . Randomisation procedure : Participants randomise either 3 group use computer-generated randomised sequence . 8 . Statistical analysis : Sample size : We aim 100 subject , referral low , calculate statistical power total 75 subject : - With 25 subject per group study 80 % power detect difference continuous variable equivalent 80 % standard deviation 2-sided p-value 0.05 . Based assumption normality , reduction one standard deviation would equivalent 24 % , therefore reduction .8 standard deviation would approximately equivalent 20 % reduction . A difference size perceive clinical importance . Repeat measure analysis increase power study although measure variability assess , unsure much . All data analyse use SAS version 8.2 ( SAS Institute Cary , NC , USA ) . Data assess normality log-transformed appropriate . Univariate analysis conduct use chi-square test equal proportion , analysis variance non-parametric Kruskal wallis test require . Multivariate analysis perform use generalise linear model adjust potential covariates repeat measure . A two side p-value 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
