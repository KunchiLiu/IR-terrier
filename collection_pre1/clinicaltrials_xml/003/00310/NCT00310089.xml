	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : AZD2171 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , doxorubicin , cyclophosphamide , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving AZD2171 together combination chemotherapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This randomized clinical trial study well give AZD2171 together combination chemotherapy work treat woman locally advance breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AZD2171 Combination Chemotherapy Treating Women With Locally Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine overall pathologic complete response rate woman previously untreated , locally advanced breast cancer treat neoadjuvant AZD2171 , doxorubicin hydrochloride , cyclophosphamide , docetaxel . Secondary - Compare change pretreatment level pKDR 1 course AZD2171 vs medication . - Determine number patient respond combination therapy begin second course therapy . - Determine clinical response rate patient treat regimen . - Determine safety regimen patient . - Determine change tumor proliferation ( Ki67 ) patient . - Determine pharmacokinetics pharmacogenetics regimen patient . - Correlate angiogenic parameter tumor response patient . - Determine tumor vascularity permeability treatment see dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI initial area gadolinium curve . - Determine tumor choline level treatment measure quantitative single-voxel MR spectroscopy correlate response . OUTLINE : This multicenter , randomize , pilot study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive oral AZD2171 daily day 1-7* course 1 . During second subsequent course , patient receive oral AZD2171 daily day 1-21 , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 3-5 minute , cyclophosphamide IV 30 minute , docetaxel IV 1 hour day 1 . Patients also receive filgrastim ( G-CSF ) subcutaneously ( SC ) day 2-11 pegfilgrastim SC day 2 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *If biopsy schedule prior day 7 8 course 1 , AZD2171 alone continue 14 day . - Arm II ( control ) : Beginning second course , patient receive AZD2171 , doxorubicin hydrochloride , cyclophosphamide , docetaxel , G-CSF pegfilgrastim arm I . All patient undergo tumor biopsiesat baseline , course 2 4 , 3 weels completion study treatment . Tissue examine various biomarkers ( phosphorylated-KDR , -MAPK , -Akt , Ki67 , VEGF , p53 ) DNA ploidy analysis** . NOTE : **Patients also undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI quantitative magnetic resonance spectroscopy 1 week begin therapy , 24 hour start therapy , prior course 2 , 4 , 6 , 3 week completion study treatment . After completion AZD2171 chemotherapy , patient undergo surgical resection . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
