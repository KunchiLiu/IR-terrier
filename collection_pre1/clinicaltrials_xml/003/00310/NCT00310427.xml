	<brief_summary>This study determine whether experimental drug LY686017 reduce person 's desire alcohol . A brain chemical call Substance P act place brain call NK1 receptor . Substance P release response stress give rise behavior think represent anxiety . LY686017 block Substance P act NK1 receptor . People 21 65 year age drinking regular basis least one month enter study , meet criterion alcohol dependence elevate score general test anxiety may eligible study . Participants admit NIH Clinical Center 35 day . They participate alcohol treatment program addition research study . After withdrawn alcohol least 2 day , participant receive either 50 mg LY686017 placebo ( inactive substance look like study drug ) every morning 28 day . In addition drug treatment , undergo follow procedure : - Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) : In last week study , subject undergo MRI study amount blood go brain structure think involve anxiety crave . During procedure , look picture face exhibit various emotion picture related alcohol . - Cue reactivity : At begin towards end study , subject ask rate alcohol crave anxiety level sniff handle favorite alcoholic beverage water . - Metyrapone test : During week 1 4 study , subject give metyrapone - drug interfere body 's ability make stress hormone cortisol - determine LY686017 affect body 's hormonal response . The drop cortisol metyrapone administration cause brain release ACTH , hormone cause adrenal gland make cortisol . - Trier test : In last week study , subject give 5-minute speech three people ask subtract number head . Then ask rate feeling desire alcohol two rating scale . Blood drawn saline lock begin end test measure hormone level . - Rating scale : Subjects complete Obsessive Drinking Scale weekly Alcohol Urge Questionnaire Comprehensive Psychiatric Rating Scale twice week . - Blood test : Blood sample collect periodically check blood chemistry , clot time , amount LY686017 blood .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Alcoholism chronic relapse disorder characterized cycle intoxication intersperse phase withdrawal abstinence . Co-morbidity depression anxiety disorder high . Even absence independent psychiatric co-morbidity , anxiety symptom almost invariably present early well protracted abstinence , sensitize repeat cycle intoxication withdrawal , correlate crave alcohol upon exposure alcohol associate cue . This psychopathology likely maintain dependent state since show stress negative affective state major relapse trigger factor . Substance P , release amygdala response stress , act NK1 receptor important mediator behavioral stress effect experimental animal . Blockade receptor subtype represent novel principle anxiolytic like action , well document animal model supportive data human . Furthermore , decrease opiate reward follow NK1 receptor inaction indicate report deletion NK1 receptor decrease condition place preference self-administration opiate , similar reduction alcohol reward suggest preliminary data show decreased voluntary intake alcohol NK1 null-mutants . Aims : The present study aim provide initial , exploratory evaluation whether NK1 receptor candidate target treatment alcohol dependence would merit clinical development conventional , full-scale clinical trial design . To evaluate , aim present study determine whether NK1 antagonism beneficially affect , anxious alcohol dependent subject early abstinence , surrogate variable correlate clinical outcome , i.e . - reduce crave alcohol , measure baseline self-reported urge , response presentation alcohol associate cue - reduce negative affect - influence correspond objective measure ( brain fMRI responses alcohol-associated cue fear stimulus , respectively ; endocrine stress response ) . This study address aim use novel , orally bioavailable brain penetrant NK1 antagonist . Positive data exploratory study would first kind , provide rationale evaluate NK1 antagonist anti-craving / anti-dipsotropic anti-anxiety action alcohol dependent subject long term , suggest might aid relapse prevention . Methods : The study carry 50 subject age 21-65 year , alcohol dependence primary complaint , without serious medical psychiatric condition . An additional inclusion criterion presence history significant anxiety symptom self report . Subjects admit NIAAA research inpatient unit NIH Clinical Center platform train natural history protocol provide basic assessment standard withdrawal treatment need . Patients enter present protocol treatment , need , complete . The present protocol start 1 week single blind placebo lead-in . During phase , baseline alcohol cue-reactivity session carry accord establish procedure , urge drink assess . Cue-responsive subject , appr . 70 % alcohol dependent inpatient , randomize active treatment placebo , enter active treatment phase . The active treatment arm receive 50 mg daily LY686017by oral intake , placebo group continue receive placebo double-blind fashion . The duration active treatment 3 week . Patients remain hospitalized throughout protocol . During period , psychotropic medication allow , abstinence alcohol drug monitor . Measures crave obtain use : 1 ) rating complete twice week establish Alcohol Urge Questionnaire ( AUQ ) ; 2 ) assessment urge drink ( baseline medication ) establish cue reactivity paradigm patient undergoes invivo exposure prefer alcoholic beverage . The medicated cue reactivity session follow immediately Trier Test , social stress task independently induce urge alcohol ( stress induce craving ) ; augments subsequent cue-induced urge ( stress-potentiated cue induce crave ) ; 3 ) weekly assessment alcohol related cognition use Obsessive Drinking Scale ( ODS ) , pharmacologically validate subscale establish Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale ( OCDS ) . In addition , measure anxiety depression symptom obtain twice-weekly use Comprehensive Psychiatric Rating Scale ( CPRS ) . During last treatment week , subject undergo fMRI scan use establish paradigms evoke emotional response , evoke alcohol-cue associated response , respectively . Psychophysiological measure obtain conjunction scan . Blood draws carry day scan allow analysis plasma concentration experimental drug . The neuroendocrine stress response probed , use standard metyrapone challenge test , unmedicated state follow baseline CR session , active treatment placebo follow fMRI scan .</detailed_description>
