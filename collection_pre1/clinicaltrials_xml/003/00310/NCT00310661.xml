	<brief_summary>TD troublesome potentially irreversible side effect associate use neuroleptic . While new neuroleptic improve regard , still carry risk TD . The present study propose sarizotan potential agent treat neuroleptic-induced TD base preliminary data indicate efficacy management dyskinesia associate Parkinson 's disease . Its efficacy substantiate pre-clinical data obtain vacuous chew movement ( VCM ) model rat , model employ investigate relationship D2 occupancy TD . The present study also examine effect sarizotan cognitive function , give association TD cognitive deficit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sarizotan Treatment Neuroleptic-induced Tardive Dyskinesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study assess safety anti-dyskinetic property sarizotan various dosage neuroleptic-induced TD . The secondary objective study assess effect sarizotan cognitive function patient neuroleptic-induced TD . The diagnosis neuroleptic-induced TD confirm history physical examination . Patients evaluated baseline , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 week . Safety assess vital sign , ECG , routine blood test , ACTH stimulation test , clinician 's patient 's global impression tolerability . Procedures : For efficacy , primary outcome variable change Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale ( AIMS ) , baseline score &gt; 3 ( 'moderate ' ) require item 8 ( Severity Abnormal Movements ) . Quantitative evaluation movement carry two way . The first involve series instrumental clinical measure develop battery assessment antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism TD . The second mean quantify movement involve use video recording , independent evaluation several raters ( Appendix I ) . Such approach gain popularity quantification movement disorder mean improve reliability . Secondary measure include positive negative syndrome scale ( PANSS ) movement disorder scale ( Simpson-Angus Rating Scales ) acute extrapyramidal symptom ( EPS ) , Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale ( BARS ) . Global impression efficacy tolerability clinician ( CGI ) patient ( PGI ) record study visit commencement treatment . To assess potential cognitive change may occur conjunction TD change , battery neuropsychological test carry baseline endpoint ( see Appendix II ) . To assess relationship primary negative symptom deficit syndrome , total sub-scales Positive Negative Syndrome Scale evaluate .</detailed_description>
