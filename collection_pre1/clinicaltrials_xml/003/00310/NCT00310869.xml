	<detailed_description>The study test continue long-term intervention effectiveness adolescence early bear US preterm infant , participate randomize Newborn Individualized Developmental Care Assessment Program ( NIDCAP ) trial , conduct principal investigator , infant care NICU first three month premature birth . All adolescent study participated newborn assign either control care ( standard NICU care available time ) , experimental care ( NIDCAP developmental care , weekly bedside observation daily NIDCAP developmental specialist support parent staff ) , NICU admission 2 week ( w ) expect full-term due date ( 'corrected ' age [ CA ] ) . The strongly brain-based theory underlie approach early intervention describe tested several experimental study , design investigate effect plan purposeful modification experience early born infant , spend third trimester gestation NICU . NIDCAP base approach utilize close observation infant 's threshold move organization disorganization stress , exhibit infant 's behavior . Care environment continuously dynamically adjust , goal increase infant 's self-regulation organization decrease infant 's stress . This individualized model NICU care provide opportunity investigate modifiability early born infant ' brain function structure possibility reduce altogether eliminate disruption disturbance fetal brain development NICU . The randomized scientific trial date , conduct PI independent investigator setting formal training show consistent significant neurobehavioral neurophysiological improvement experimental group across site study . All adolescent study evaluate comprehensively 2wCA 9 month ( ) CA term commonly measure demographic , medical background severity illness variable , importantly term comprehensive neurobehavioral EEG outcome measure , analogue later developmental competence disability . The design current study adolescent randomize control trial ( RCT ) two parallel group ( control experimental ) , question independent variable 'group effect ' two dependent measure ( adolescent physical growth cognitive development ) . In addition group status , contribution four additional independent measure outcome also evaluate : Parent socioeconomic status , parent cognitive function , adolescent physical function adolescent psychosocial function . The outcome examiner blind subject group status throughout . The design assure true experimental test NICU intervention effect adolescence . The significance importance study lay unique opportunity evaluate comprehensively adolescent long-term neurodevelopment , learn adaptive outcome due developmental care intervention receive early stage development . This first study test long-term effectiveness modification experience NICU brain-protective , learning-enhancing model high-risk , early-born preterm infant . The importance study lie potential contribute significantly understanding preterm brain development relationship long-term mental adaptive functional outcome adolescence highly jeopardized grow group preterm child . The result expect key importance decision policy development evidence-based target sparse special education resource .</detailed_description>
