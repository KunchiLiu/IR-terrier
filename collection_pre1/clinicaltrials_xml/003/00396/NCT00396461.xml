	<detailed_description>During last year widely use lipid emulsion parenteral nutrition base soybean oil . This first generation lipid emulsion use TPN contain w-6 series polyunsaturated long-chain fatty acid ( LCT ) soy , maize , sunflower safflower oil . LCT contain excess linoleic acid , metabolise , produce large quantity arachidonic acid metabolite . Although generally use dos seem safe ( 1-2 g/kg/day continuous perfusion ) , alteration pulmonary function patient acute adult respiratory distress syndrome describe , alteration platelet function , hepatic function haemodynamics , attribute excess say metabolite . However , important side effect LCT lipid infusion influence immune response . Experimental clinical study show LCT interfere various stage immune response production antibody , complement synthesis , granulocytic lymphocytic activity reticuloendothelial system . Various hypothesis formulate explain modulator effect polyunsaturated fatty acid immune function : change permeability cellular membrane , modification synthesis eicosanoids presence peroxide derive oxidation polyunsaturated fatty acid . In summary , although linoleic acid dietary essential fatty acid important , excessive intake associate undesirable immunological inflammatory event . Thus recommended soybean oil partly replace lipid . To avoid side effect second generation lipid emulsion develop . These contain combination medium- long-chain fatty acid ( MCT/LCT ) low w-6 fatty acid content . MCT/LCT lipid emulsion safe produce biochemical metabolic alteration gaseous exchange patient ARDS . MCT/LCT combination seem reduce generation eicosanoids alter immune response in-vitro experimental study . The impact differences nosocomial infection clinical prognosis patient study sufficiently despite fact study show reduced mortality morbidity use MCT/LCT emulsion compare use pure LCT emulsion . MCT/LCT emulsion normally use clinical practice patient require parenteral nutrition 20 year . Recently , clinical use artificial nutrition omega-3 series polyunsaturated fatty acid , eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) present many fish oil significant . EPA precursor certain eicosanoid series compensate proinflammatory effect eicosanoids arachidonic acid ( omega-6 series ) . The objective immunomodulation attenuate inflammatory response patient without negatively impact immune function . The use enteral diet enrich omega-3 series fatty acid ( fish oil ) post-operation cancer patient show reduction number day hospital infectious complication . The use fish oil fat emulsion enrich fish oil ( omega-3 ) parenteral nutrition already subject various study : modulation inflammatory response marker show , reduces stay hospital need mechanical ventilation patient undergoing major abdominal surgery , reduces stay hospital patient undergo digestive surgery… So , w-3 lipid exhibit strong immunologic property . They offer possibility counterbalance negative effect conventional w-6 fatty acid . Recent study exhibit positive effect intravenous use fish oil immunologic function clinical parameter surgical septic patient The purpose study analyse effect two total parenteral nutrition diet lipid emulsion different composition incidence nosocomial infection critical patient . One diet contain MCT/LCT emulsion concentrate 20 % ( 50:50 ratio ) ( w3 : w6 1:7 ) comprise MCT/LCT/fish oil emulsion ( 50:40:10 ratio ) ( w3 : w6 1:2,7 ) . The secondary objective study analyse mortality hospital 6 month discharge .</detailed_description>
