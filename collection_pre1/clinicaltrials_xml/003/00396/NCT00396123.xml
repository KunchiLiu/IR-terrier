	<brief_summary>Humans cell blood stream call endothelial progenitor cell EPCs . These think important keep blood vessel healthy . People chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) low number cell . People cardiovascular ( heart blood vessel ) disease also low number . Patients CKD cardiovascular disease group.Erythropoietin hormone make kidney . It essential make red blood cell also activate EPCs . It low people kidney disease . As part regular medical care correct low red blood cell count , receive medication act like erythropoietin . It call darbepoetin . The purpose study see darbepoetin treatment affect EPC number function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Of Darbepoetin On Vascular Repair Mechanisms In Kidney Disease The DARBEPC Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The majority patient kidney disease , estimate 20 million adult U.S. , die cardiovascular disease . Further , risk cardiovascular event 2-3 fold high general population increase severity renal impairment [ 1 ] . Reasons accelerate atherosclerotic process unclear . Recent evidence suggest endothelial progenitor cell ( EPC ) critical maintain vascular integrity [ 2 ] . Patient population low circulate EPCs , include patient kidney disease , excess vascular disease burden . The hematopoietic cytokine , erythropoietin , key regulator EPCs reduce patient kidney disease [ 3 ] . Therefore , hypothesize supplementation erythropoietin analog , darbepoetin , enhance EPC function lead improvement vascular repair mechanisms patient chronic ( CKD ) . To begin explore hypothesis , pursue follow specific aim . 1 . Determine effect darbepoetin EPC number patient anemia relate CKD 2 . Determine effect darbepoetin EPC function patient anemia relate CKD 3 . Determine effect darbepoetin proangiogenic factor patient anemia related CKD These study expand understand potentially guide therapy aim reduce excess cardiovascular disease burden high risk population .</detailed_description>
