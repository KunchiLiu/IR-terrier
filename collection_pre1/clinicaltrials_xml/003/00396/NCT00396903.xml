	<brief_summary>During insertion epidural catheter several complication occur , include transient paraesthesia inadvertent venous cannulation . Reported incidence paraesthesia vary widely 0.2 % 50 % different article , depend catheter ( catheter material , soft-tipped firm-tipped catheter ) , apply technique ( lumbar thoracic epidural anesthesia , depth catheter insertion ) , approach ( midline paramedian ) include patient ( obstetrical non-obstetrical ) . Furthermore , inconsistent definition `` paraesthesia '' make difficult compare result different study . Paraesthesia suppose lead permanent neurological sequelea , unpleasant perturb sensation patient . For inadvertent venous cannulation epidural catheter placement , incidences 1 % 14 % report . As paraesthesia rate , catheter material , technique , approach include patient determinant incidence vessel puncture . Main objective study determine incidence paraesthesia catheter . Secondary objective record - frequency inadvertent venous cannulation - difficulty involve insertion removal catheter - data additional complication - data evaluation handling characteristic</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design This study prospective , uncontrolled , open , non-randomised study ( `` Observational Study '' ) CE-certified medical device . Patients Information consent Information procedure oral consent epidural anaesthesia surgery obtain usual . Oral consent data collection obtain . No randomisation blind perform non-standard procedure necessary . Inclusion criteria 100 patient schedule Epidural Anaesthesia include study . Eligible patient ASA class I-III , 18 75 year age schedule EA , without general anaesthesia . Exclusion criterion Anamnestic exclusion criterion contraindication epidural anaesthesia ( e.g . neurological deficit , skin infection puncture site , diseases lead neurological impairment diabetes , coagulation impairment ) . Non-competent non-cooperative patient well pregnant breast-feeding woman also exclude . Same apply patient medicament- drug abuse problem communication participate parallel another clinical study experimental drug device . Randomisation Blinding No randomization require . An independent observer perform epidural record occurrence , incidence intensity paraesthesia . Definition main secondary criterion Main criterion - Frequency paraesthesia catheter insertion Secondary criterion - Frequency inadvertent venous cannulation ( aspiration blood ) - Intensity paraesthesia ( VAS ) - description : - pain - electric shock - burning sensation - shoot effect - motor reaction ( right/left ) - discomfort - others - Frequency kind difficulty insertion catheter ( rating `` easiness insertion '' : 0 = resistance , 1 = minor difficulty , 2 = serious difficulty , 3 = impossible ) - Facultative : Documentation paraesthesia/difficulties catheter removal 48 hour surgery ( earlier , appropriate ) Concomitant parameter - Patient data ( age , height , weight , sex , diagnosis , kind intervention , ASA class , relevant co-diagnosis , relevant co-medication ) - Epidural anaesthesia -analgesia relate data â€¢ Data relate description puncture process method choose case difficulty puncture , catheter insertion removal - Level sensory blockade - Indwelling time epidural catheter record time insertion - Dose/kind anaesthetic use epidural anaesthesia , type general anaesthesia relevant - Kind analgesia do epidural catheter - Adequacy epidural anaesthesia ( yes / ) - Further complications/side effect related epidural anaesthesia/analgesia ( i.e . dural puncture , haematoma , etc ) - Judgement anaesthesiologist concern handle feature ( 0 = resistance , 1 = minor difficulty , 2 = serious difficulty ) - Catheter damage</detailed_description>
