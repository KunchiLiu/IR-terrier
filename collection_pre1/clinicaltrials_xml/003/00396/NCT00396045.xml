	<brief_title>Melphalan , Prednisone , CC-5013 ( Revlimid ) Induction Therapy Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Multiple Myeloma patient , standard treatment oral combination Melphalan Prednisone ( MP ) . This approach induce partial response ( PR ) rate approximately 50 % complete remission ( CR ) rate 1-5 % , median remission duration 18-20 month median overall survival 3 year . Recently , combination oral MP plus thalidomide increased response rate 80 % complete remission rate 20 % , mark cytoreduction first step toward sustained remission period . CC-5013 ( Revlimid ) thalidomide analogue , 50000 time potent thalidomide inhibit TNF-alfa secretion , potent growth factor myeloma cell . Revlimid represent novel class anti-cancer drug , active patient multiple myeloma refractory conventional high-dose chemotherapy response rate approximately 30 % . The association Revlimid plus dexamethasone increase response rate induce Revlimid additional 30 % . This study evaluate safety efficacy association Melphalan/Prednisone/Revlimid ( MPR ) induction treatment newly diagnose myeloma patient age 65 65 year refuse eligible high dose therapy . This association might increase response rate achieve standard oral MP regimen . In first part study ( phase I component ) , different dos oral Melphalan ( 0.18-0.25 mg/Kg ) associate Prednisone ( MP ) combine escalate dos Revlimid ( 5 mg/day ) administer together . This phase define MTD association . In second part study ( phase II component ) , 30 patient treat MPR dose/s define phase I component verify data response toxicity .</detailed_description>
