	<detailed_description>Dopamine play critical role nicotine ( ) addiction drug know release DA brain area mediate reward motivational process . Although image study show release DA follow smoking , little known regard common genetic polymorphism propose play role nicotine dependence ( e.g . DRD2 , DAT serotonin transporter SERT ) interact smoke status ( non-smoker , ex-smoker , light smoker , present smoker ) modulate individual difference nicotine-induced DA release dopamine receptor occupancy , vivo . Individual difference dopaminergic tone could result under-stimulation reward circuit could put subject great risk seek drug stimulation ( release DA ) mean compensate deficit temporarily activate reward circuit . The current proposal combine brain image genomics towards unravel complex relationship smoking phenotype common polymorphism . Understanding whether genetic factor contribute inter-individual variability crucial interpret image result context disease pathology . Nicotine dependence complex process include initiation smoking , persistence difficulty quit . By compare receptor occupancy , nicotine-induced DA release , common genetic polymorphism across smoke behavior well understand complex interaction genetic makeup , personality several stage nicotine addiction .</detailed_description>
