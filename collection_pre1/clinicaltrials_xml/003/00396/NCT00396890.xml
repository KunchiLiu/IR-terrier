	<brief_summary>This study determine whether stimulation right side brain repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) follow stimulation leave side theta burst stimulation ( TBS ) temporarily change brain activity improve hand movement subject recently achieve rTMS alone . For rTMS , wire coil hold patient 's scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . The subject hears click may feel pull sensation skin coil . There may twitch muscle face , arm leg . The subject may ask tense certain muscle slightly perform simple action . The effect TMS muscle detect small metal disk electrode tap skin arm leg . This study use two kind rTMS . In one ( Hz rTMS ) , magnetic pulse give per second period 20 minute ; ( TBS ) , series pulse give burst , last 2 second , period 3 minute . Healthy normal volunteer 18 55 year age may eligible study . Participants undergo follow procedure three visit NIH Clinical Center : Visit 1 : Participants receive either real sham rTMS apply right side brain follow real sham TBS apply left side brain . In addition , subject undergo follow : `` Pinch force : Subjects press wedge instrument thumb index finger hard several trial every 10 seconds. `` Speed tapping : Subjects press key computer keyboard quickly possible 10 second , repeat several trials. `` Simple reaction time : Subjects respond quickly possible `` go '' signal present computer monitor perform quick wrist movement. `` Electromyography : Subjects ' muscle activity record use electrode ( small metal disk ) fill conductive gel tap skin muscle . Visits 2 3 Visit 2 schedule one day visit 1 , visit 3 one week visit 1 . Participants brain stimulation two visit , TMS measurement , behavioral measurement , electromyography ( EMG ) see brain stimulation do first visit still present period time . At three visit , participant comp ...</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Previous study demonstrate single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) apply primary motor cortex ( MI ) exert transient inhibitory effect contralateral MI . Furthermore , down-regulation excitability MI one hemisphere 1Hz rTMS result increase excitability homologous MI accompany performance improvement simple motor task perform hand ipsilateral rTMS . It propose phenomenon relies interhemispheric disinhibition MI . Furthermore , interhemispheric disinhibition also promise method boost neurorehabilitation since interhemispheric disinhibition successfully apply stroke patient enhance motor cortex excitability hand function reduce aphasia . The purpose protocol test hypothesis interhemispheric disinhibition leave MI down-regulating activity right MI enhance additional up-regulation targeting leave MI . STUDY POPULATION : We study total number 72 healthy volunteer age 18-55 . DESIGN : To test hypothesis , subject randomly allocate one 4 experimental session ( parallel design ) . Subjects receive different type combine brain stimulation ( 1 Hz rTMS Theta Burst Stimulation [ TBS ] ) right leave MI . The primary outcome measure amount change cortical excitability , reflect recruitment curve ( RC ) motor evoke potential ( MEPs ) elicit single-pulse TMS leave MI . Additionally , test change short-interval intracortical inhibition ( SICI ) facilitation ( ICF ) well modulation interhemispheric inhibition ( IHI ) MI . The secondary outcome measure include simple motor task finger tap , pinch force/acceleration reaction time right hand . In summary , believe approach might identify additional effective strategy enhance functional recovery stroke might provide deep insight neural substrate involve performance improvement bilateral brain stimulation .</detailed_description>
