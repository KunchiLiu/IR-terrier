	<brief_summary>This Phase III , open-label study conduct 44 center United States , Canada , Puerto Rico . 223 subject require hemodialysis ( HD ) dysfunctional HD catheter enrol study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Tenecteplase Restoration Function Dysfunctional Hemodialysis ( HD ) Catheters</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study consist four visit correspond consecutive HD session patient , well one follow-up visit . Patients could receive three treatment open-label tenecteplase study : one two treatment initial treatment course , eligible patient whose catheter become dysfunctional within 21 day first visit receive additional treatment part retreatment ( RT ) course . At Visit 1 , patient eligible begin HD 2 mL ( 2 mg ) tenecteplase instill two lumen HD catheter . After dwell time 1 hour , study drug withdrawn subject underwent HD . The duration HD session fix study protocol , rather site 's HD practice , physician order , individual patient response session . Patients experience treatment success end Visit 1 2 mL ( 2 mg ) tenecteplase instill lumen catheter part initial treatment course . The treatment leave dwell extended time , second HD session Visit 2 ( 72 hour later ) . Patients receive extended-dwell tenecteplase treatment withdrawn catheter begin Visit 2 . Patients underwent HD prescribe extent possible . Patients treatment success Visit 1 Visit 2 recurrence catheter dysfunction within 21 day Visit 1 meet re-treatment eligibility criterion 2 mL ( 2 mg ) tenecteplase instilled lumen , follow 1-hour dwell time re-treatment Visit 1 .</detailed_description>
