	<brief_summary>This study slow grow tumor call plexiform neurofibroma ( PNF ) relatively common problem people neurofibromatosis type 1 ( NF1 ) . These tumor benign grow , become disfigure well disable even life threaten . They often cause pain , difficulty use arm legs spinal cord compression , and/or nerve damage . At present , available therapy plexiform neurofibromas try surgically remove much tumor possible . Because tumor grow surround area , total surgical resection often impossible . Most tumor re-grow surgery entire tumor remove . To date , treatment include chemotherapy radiotherapy able shrink tumor . Interferon drug use different type tumor well hepatitis . It use treatment plexiform neurofibroma ( PNF ) subject show improvement symptom and/or decrease size tumor . Most subject growth tumor PEG-Intron . The drug use study PEG ( pegylated ) -Intron . PEG-Intron long act form interferon keep drug break body longer period time potentially could effective short-acting interferon . PEG-Intron approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment Hepatitis C. The goal study : 1 . To determine child 's plexiform neurofibroma respond PEG-Intron give weekly . 2 . To determine side effect PEG-Intron give weekly participant plexiform neurofibromas . 3 . To evaluate new method measuring change size tumor call volume analysis . This method measure entire volume tumor three dimension . The standard method measuring tumor use length and/or width tumor . By study different way measure tumor investigator hope able determine method accurate useful .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study PEG-Intron Plexiform Neurofibromas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PEG-Intron give every week small needle skin , way insulin give people diabetes . Subjects teach home . As long tumor n't grow side effect tolerable , injection give week 2 year . Children enrol study one three stratum ( patient group ) : stratum 1 include child symptom associate PNF MRI scan past year may may show tumor growth , strata 2 include child symptom associate PNF MRI scan past year show growth stratum 3 include child show increase size PNF MRI scan past year , without symptom .</detailed_description>
