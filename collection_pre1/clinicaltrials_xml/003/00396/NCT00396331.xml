	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , multicenter , prospective , open-label study . Once 70 patient enrol , subsequent patient enrol diagnosis lymphoma . Patients would benefit autologous stem cell transplant , fail previous collection collection attempt mobilization regimen granulocyte colony-stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) alone , chemotherapy G-CSF , conventional therapy include cytokine , chemotherapy cytokine bone marrow harvest , meet inclusion/exclusion criterion eligible receive plerixafor outline protocol . The change standard care mobilization regimen include G-CSF addition dose plerixafor even prior day apheresis . Patients undergo mobilization G-CSF ( 10 µg/kg ) 4 day . On Day 4 , plerixafor ( 240 µg/kg ) administer even prior first apheresis subsequent even prior apheresis thereafter , 10 11 hour interval dose initiation apheresis . Patients continue receive G-CSF day apheresis . Patients undergo minimum 2 maximum 7 aphereses ≥2*10^6 CD34+ cells/kg collect , whichever occur first . In addition , mobilization NHL tumor cell pharmacokinetics repeat dos plerixafor examine . After last apheresis complete , patient collect ≥2*10^6 CD34+ cells/kg , he/she treat high-dose chemotherapy preparation transplantation . Patients transplant cell obtain G-CSF plerixafor mobilization regimen . In event minimum number ≥2*10^6 cell transplantation obtain first mobilization plerixafor , cell may retain pooled transplantation second mobilization plerixafor ( prior mobilization agent ) , investigator 's discretion . If second mobilization plerixafor attempt , minimum rest interval one week allow last apheresis first regimen first dose G-CSF second . The number CD34+ cell mobilize peripheral blood ( PB ) , collect apheresis product , number apheresis session perform measure . Success transplantation evaluate time engraftment polymorphonuclear leukocyte ( PMN ) platelet ( PLT ) . Participants assess durability transplant 12 month transplantation . This study previously post AnorMED , Inc . In November 2006 , AnorMED , Inc. acquire Genzyme Corporation . Genzyme Corporation sponsor trial .</detailed_description>
