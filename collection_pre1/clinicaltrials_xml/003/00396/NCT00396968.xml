	<brief_title>AMD3100 With Busulfan , Fludarabine Thymoglobulin Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplant AML MDS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single centre phase I/II study conduct two stage . The ability AMD3100 augment antileukemic effect chemotherapy stem cell transplantation patient MDS AML first subsequent relapse , second great remission primary induction failure assess . The primary objective Stage 1 determine acceptably safe dose , utilize continual reassessment method ( CRM ) .The CRM model-based statistical procedure conduct phase I clinical trial assign dos successive cohort patient base dos give outcome observe ( toxicity toxicity ) previous patient . In sense , method `` outcome-adaptive . '' The CRM rely simple Bayesian model probability toxicity function dose . As dose-toxicity data trial accumulate Bayesian model `` learns '' relationship dose probability toxicity . Numerous computer simulation study ( reference therein ) show CRM greatly superior property compare conventional `` 3+3 '' algorithm . This due facts conventional algorithms model-based , use data recent 6 patient , tend stop trial early , consequence likely give unreliable estimate toxicity probability dose provide unreliable recommend maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . Under particular version CRM use trial , follow treatment first cohort three patient initial dose level 80 µg/kg , follow decision possible : - If 0 first 3 patient ( # 1 , 2 3 ) experience toxicity , method escalate second cohort patient ( # 4 , 5 6 ) treat second dose level , 160 µg/kg . - If either 1 2 first 3 patient experience toxicity , method stay start dose , second cohort treat low dose level , 80 µg/kg . - If 3 first 3 patient experience toxicity , posterior probability low dose unacceptably toxic 0.951 , since exceeds decision cut-off 0.90 protocol phase I trial terminate conclusion low dose level 80 µg/kg excessively toxic . If trial continue , successive cohort first , since decision dose assign utilizes dose-toxicity data patient treat previously , many possibility enumerate . For example , 12 possible outcome second cohort , number increase exponentially trial progress . However , point trial , estimate probability toxicity dose base recent data may easily estimate information make available investigator . Additional safety provision middle dose 160 µg/kg may skip initially escalate 80 µg/kg , trial terminate early dose choose low dose excessively toxic . The primary objective Stage 2 determine progression free survival post-allogeneic transplant , term time treatment failure survival . Stage 1 include prognostic subgroup CR complete remission ( NCR ) . In Stage 2 , different monitoring rule use CR NCR subgroup reflect different historical failure rate . Additionally , patient treat dose select Stage 1 count member Stage 2 sample .</detailed_description>
