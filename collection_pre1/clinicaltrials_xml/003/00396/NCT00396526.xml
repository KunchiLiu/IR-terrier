	<brief_summary>Background : With document rise bacterial resistance vitro co-trimoxazole , need document vivo effectiveness drug treatment non-severe pneumonia community set . Setting : The study conduct 18 rural primary health center ( PHC ) 9 district India near Lucknow , Nagpur , New Delhi , Mumbai , Chennai , Trivandrum , Vellore , Chandigarh Bhopal . Design : The unit randomization PHC . The recruited child follow day 4 , 6 13-15 ass primary secondary outcome measure . Hypothesis : The primary hypothesis clinical failure rate use either oral amoxycillin three day five day co-trimoxazole similar . Intervention : Oral Co-trimoxazole ( 8mg/kg/day trimithoprim ) twice day five day vs. oral amoxycillin ( 20 mg/kg/day ) thrice day three day . Main objective : To compare proportion child age 2 59 month present non-severe pneumonia without wheeze , achieve clinical cure day 6 treatment 5 day oral co-trimoxazole 3 day oral amoxycillin , respectively . Main outcomes measure : Clinical cure day 6 ; clinical failure day 1-6 ; clinical relapse day 7-15 . Inclusion criterion : Children age 2-59 month non-severe pneumonia base WHO criteria respiratory rate age specific cut-off without wheeze , accessible follow , whose guardian give write informed consent . Exclusion criterion : Children severe disease , infectious disease require antibiotic treatment , document use antibiotic last 48 hour , three episode wheeze year , diagnose asthmatic , know immunodeficiency disease , acute chronic organic disease , history hospitalization within last 15 day , measles within last one month , drug allergy , refusal give consent , prior enrollment study . Sample size : Has calculate test null hypothesis . There 1100 child arm . Thus PHC require recruit minimum 122 case within one year . Policy relevance : The finding study effect ARI management policy . If current study prof three day amoxycillin clinically effective five day co-trimoxazole well documented evidence rise resistance co-trimoxazole , short course amoxycillin may become first line treatment non-severe pneumonia Time line : 18 month . Pilot March 2003 , enrollment April 2003 , Interim analysis Nov. 2003 , DMC meet Dec. 2003 , Data cleaning June 2004 , DMC meet July 2004 , Manuscript write Aug.2004 .</brief_summary>
