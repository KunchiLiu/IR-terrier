	<brief_summary>Primary Objectives : - To establish Target Aneurysm Recurrence ( TAR ) rate Matrix 2® GDC® Coils use treatment intracranial saccular aneurysm . TAR define clinically relevant recurrence resulting : target aneurysm reintervention , rupture/re-rupture and/or death unknown cause . - To correlate defined angiographic endpoint TAR rate assess predictive value , thereby provide framework establish clinically relevant endpoint future study . Secondary Objectives : - To evaluate device characteristic , incidence severity device-related adverse event , include death , neurological deterioration change functional ability . - To establish angiographic recurrence rate Matrix 2® GDC® Coils use treatment intracranial saccular aneurysm . - To explore experimental , quantitative volumetric endpoint correlate exist qualitative assessment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The endovascular treatment intracranial aneurysms become accepted alternative surgical repair give many recent advance neurointerventional device procedure . The introduction GDC coil 1993 provided physician patient less invasive treatment option . Additionally , result two large international trial , ISAT ISUIA , show benefit endovascular treatment surgery treatment specific type aneurysms . One limitation endovascular coil embolization aneurysm recurrence recanalization infrequently observe angiographically follow . Aneurysm recanalization may result aneurysm morphology , anatomic location flow orientation , aneurysm regrowth degree coil compaction . Despite widespread adoption endovascular aneurysm coiling , remain much learn efficacy optimization treatment modality . The goal endovascular embolization intracranial aneurysms prevent rupture re-rupture . Fortunately , incidence aneurysm rupture follow coil embolization low . Follow-up angiographic analysis evaluate occlusion stability treat aneurysm provide surrogate endpoint weigh likelihood rupture/re-rupture . However , angiographic interpretation subjective , operator dependent influence multiple confounding variable . The MAPS trial examine Target Aneurysm Recurrence Rates : clinically relevant recurrence rate result target aneurysm reintervention , rupture/re-rupture and/or death unknown cause Matrix 2® GDC® Coils use treatment intracranial saccular aneurysm . The trial compare TAR rate recurrence measure angiographic analysis ass utility angiographic analysis predict clinically relevant recurrence .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patient 18 80 year age ( inclusive ) . 2 . Patient document untreated intracranial saccular aneurysm 420 mm diameter angiographic lumen , rupture unruptured , suitable embolization coil . 3 . Both GDC® Coils Matrix 2® Coils ( Every attempt make treat much randomize coil type possible achieve optimal occlusion . ) treatment option ( shape allow exception GDC VortX Coil ) . 4 . Target aneurysm adequately coiled index procedure ( NO stag coil procedure ) . If Neuroform stent place separate preliminary procedure , screen enrollment coil procedure must take place stenting procedure complete . 5 .

Patient ( patient 's legally authorize representative center United States ) provide write informed consent . 7 . Patient willing able comply protocol followup requirement . 1 . Patient &lt; 18 &gt; 80 year old . 2 . Target aneurysm saccular nature ( mycotic , fusiform , dissect ) . 3 . Target aneurysm &gt; 20 mm maximum luminal dimension , &lt; 4 mm maximum luminal dimension . 4 . Target aneurysm previously treat surgery endovascular therapy . 5 . Target aneurysm physician 's estimation unlikely successfully treat endovascular technique . 6 . Patient present Hunt Hess grade IV V rupture aneurysm . 7 . Patient present Modified Rankin Score 4 5 baseline . 8 . Patient concurrently enrol another investigational drug device study unless permission grant sponsor . 9 . Patient known hypersensitivity Polyglycolic Polylactic Acid ( PGLA ) , platinum , nickel , stainless steel structurally related compound find Matrix 2® Coils and/or GDC® Coils . 10 .
