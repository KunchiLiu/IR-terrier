	<brief_summary>Multicenter , open-label study NPI-0052 patient advance solid tumor malignancy refractory lymphoma whose disease progress treatment standard , approve therapy include 2 stage . The initial stage involve dose escalation MTD determination recommend Phase 2 dose . The second stage comprise expansion cohort recommend Phase 2 dose .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>NPI-0052 ( also know marizomab ) second generation proteasome inhibitor develop anticancer agent . Proteasomes responsible degrade substrate damage aged protein , tumor suppressor , cell cycle regulator , regulate NF-κB activation degrade inhibitor , IκB . Blocking proteasome pathway result accumulation proteins , cause cell death , particularly tumor cell ( Kisselev , 2001 ) . The Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve first proteasome inhibitor ( bortezomib ; Velcade® ) 2003 treatment patient multiple myeloma ( MM ) subsequently treatment patient mantle cell lymphoma 2006 . Although compound demonstrate efficacy indication , resistance toxicity develop continue therapy . Resistance may result variety mechanism . Bortezomib toxicity ( primarily neurological peripheral neuropathy neuralgia , also thrombocytopenia neutropenia ) result treatment discontinuation ( 25 % patient clinical trial conduct patient time first relapse require cessation therapy due adverse event ) . NPI-0052 inhibits chymotrypsin-like ( CT-L ) , caspase-like ( C-L ) , trypsin-like ( T-L ) activity human erythrocyte-derived 20S proteasomes . Also know salinosporamide A , NPI-0052 novel chemical entity discover fermentation Salinispora tropica NPS021184 , marine actinomycete , manufacture saline fermentation . NPI-0052 show nonclinical study increase potency duration biological effect compare bortezomib may provide significant therapeutic advantage , particularly toxicity less therapeutic dos . This first-in-human study NPI-0052 , conduct cancer patient .</detailed_description>
