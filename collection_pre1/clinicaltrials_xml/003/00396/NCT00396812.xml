	<brief_summary>Rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) chronic inflammatory disease characterize joint swelling , pain , stiffness , damage , ultimately loss joint function . Scientists estimate 1.3 million people ( 0.6 percent ) U.S. adult population RA . Current therapy target immune system early disease process joint damage occurs , include drug methotrexate ( MTX ) tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -blocking agent . Rituximab disease-modifying antirheumatic drug ( DMARD ) recently approve FDA use combination MTX treatment moderately severely active RA patient inadequate response TNF-blocking agent , effort try slow course disease . This study examine effect rituximab immune response disease activity participant early RA treat disease-modifying agent . In addition , safety tolerability rituximab population examine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab Treatment Early Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RA inflammatory disease cause pain , swell , stiffness , loss function joint . It occur immune system , normally defend body invade organism , turn attack membrane lining joint . RA commonly manage DMARDs initiate early disease process , irreversible joint damage occur . The common DMARD prescribed United States MTX ; drug well tolerate well efficacy compare DMARDs , inadequate provide lasting improvement individual RA . In patient inadequate response MTX alone , use biologic agent , include TNF-blocking agent combination MTX , become standard therapeutic approach . Rituximab ( anti-CD20 ) man-made antibody use treat certain type cancer . The drug block CD20 antigen find surface B cell know deplete B cell administer intravenously . Previous research suggest B-cell activity important pathogenesis RA , B-cell depletion may decrease inflammation symptom RA . Rituximab recently approve FDA use combination MTX treatment patient moderately severely active RA inadequate response TNF-blocking agent . This study examine effect rituximab immune response disease activity patient early active RA treat disease-modifying agent . Levels B T cell marker disease activity monitor study . The safety tolerability rituximab DMARD-naive population examine . The expected duration study 2.5 year . All participant receive two intravenous infusion rituximab outpatient setting study entry Week 2 . Throughout study , participant receive MTX , systemic corticosteroid , folic folinic acid . MTX dose re-evaluated disease activity score every month Month 6 Months 8 , 10 , 12 . Systemic corticosteroid dos modify base participant 's health study . Use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) permit , NSAID dose change study , possible . NSAIDs provide study . There maximum 2 screen visit study treatment , baseline visit ( Day 0 ) , 11 study visit . A physical exam , assessment adverse event , blood collection occur study visit . Kidney liver function test rheumatologic evaluation occur study visit ; participant also ask complete questionnaire health study visit . Arthroscopy ( knee biopsy ) inflame knee occur baseline Month 3 . Participants contact telephone day arthroscopy rituximab infusion .</detailed_description>
