	<brief_title>BCG Vaccination Delivered Intradermally , Orally Combined Routes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vaccination Bacillus Calmette-Guérin ( BCG ) use part tuberculosis ( TB ) control strategies world outside United States constitute widely implement vaccination strategy worldwide . However , despite widespread use BCG , TB remain lead infectious cause death worldwide estimate one-third world 's population chronically asymptomatically ( latently ) infect Mycobacterium tuberculosis ( Mtb ) , causative agent TB . This phase I , single-center , randomize , vaccine trial include six double-blind , placebo-controlled group one open-label group . Approximately 68 ( 80 ) healthy male female subject 18-40 year old , inclusive , negative QuantiFERON®-TB Gold human immunodeficiency virus enrol . The expected total duration volunteer enrollment , vaccination , follow-up ( volunteer participation ) study 30 month . All volunteer expect enrolled period 9 month study 24 month . Detailed immune study freeze sample expect continue collection sample protocol complete . Eligibility determine volunteer 's health prescreening eligible subject give study specific main study inform consent enrollment study . Subjects randomize Groups A-F receive , Day 0 1 year later , BCG intradermally , orally , route . PBS ( PO ) Sauton medium ( injectable ) placebo use blind study . Subjects randomize Group G receive BCG intradermally Day 0 . The primary study objective assessment safety combine individual intradermal ( ID ) oral ( PO ) vaccination Statens Serum Institut ( SSI ) BCG healthy , immunologically naïve volunteer ; comparison mycobacteria-specific interferon-gamma response mucosal immunoglobulin-A induce SSI BCG vaccination give intradermally , orally route combine ; comparison safety immunogenicity Danish Connaught BCG give intradermally . The secondary study objective assessment purify protein derivative skin test responses indication cutaneous T cell traffic vaccination SSI BCG ; quantitation BCG replication Sanofi Pasteur ID BCG ulcerative lesion ID BCG vaccination . The exploratory study objective comparison intracellular kill activity induce SSI BCG vaccination give intradermally , orally , route combine ; characterization mycobacteria-specific T cell induce intradermally , orally , rout vaccination SSI BCG use dendritic cell antigen-presenting cell store peripheral blood mononuclear cell source match T cell collect vaccination .
