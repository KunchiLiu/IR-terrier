	<brief_summary>Chronic sinusitis report one widespread disorder United States . It cause variety reason allergy , infection and/or defect T-cells help regulate immune function . Medication cost related treatment nasal sinus infection estimate $ 60 million annually put considerable strain economy health care . Probiotics live microorganism normally present gut healthy individual . They also know `` friendly bacteria '' use help maintain normal function immune system . They safe commercially available form yoghurt , sachet , chewable tablet flavor capsule . Since number nasal sinus disorder relate allergy improper functioning immune system , hypothesize regular use probiotic may help improve chronic nasal sinus symptom boost immune response . The project propose novel would first study evaluate usefulness probiotic large population chronic sinusitis rather allergic symptom . We aim assess whether regular use probiotic help improve symptom chronic sinusitis great effect placebo regard .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Probiotics Adjunctive Treatment Chronic Rhinosinusitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Probiotics live microorganism administer adequate amount confer health benefit host . They part normal gastrointestinal flora safely use boost immune response patient perennial seasonal allergic rhinitis . Their exact mechanism benefit unknown primarily help regulate T-cell function important maintaining immune tolerance . Chronic rhinosinusitis widely prevalent affect nearly 16 million people US alone year . It put strain health resource nation term cost related medication surgery . Chronic rhinosinusitis cause variety reason include allergy/hypersensitivity , infection , nasal anatomical variation T-cell regulatory dysfunction . We hypothesize regular use probiotic patient chronic rhinosinusitis result substantial improvement symptom boost immunity may also help decrease medication usage . Our study double-blinded , randomized , control trial . We hope recruit 100 patient University Otolaryngology Allergy Clinics . Fifty patient randomize treatment ( active ) arm 50 patient placebo arm . Subjects follow 2 month period participation study . The main aim study determine whether regular use probiotic patient chronic rhinosinusitis help improve quality life . Our main outcome interest change mean score Sino-Nasal Outcome Test ( SNOT-20 ) form treatment group great change mean score SNOT-20 treatment arm compare placebo arm . If probiotic find effective , may use cost-effective , adjunctive therapy patient chronic rhinosinusitis .</detailed_description>
