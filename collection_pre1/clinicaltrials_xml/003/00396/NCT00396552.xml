	<brief_title>Treating Refractory Obsessive Compulsive Disorder With rTMS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obsessive-compulsive disorder ( OCD ) severe debilitate psychiatric illness characterize intrusive unwanted thought ( obsession ) repetitive ritualistic action intend reduce anxiety ( compulsion ) . OCD common lifetime prevalence estimate 2.5 % , equally affect gender ethnic group . It also typically chronic nature , result substantial impact quality life . Functioning markedly impair ; estimate 20 % individual OCD consider severely affect . Although pathophysiology unclear , hyperactivity prefrontal orbital cortex consistently demonstrate , normalizes treatment . A decrease cortical inhibition implicate OCD utilize variety method , include paired-pulse TMS . First-line treatment typically consist either cognitive-behavioural therapy and/or pharmacotherapy serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI 's clomipramine ) . Ordinarily modest benefit obtain conventional pharmacotherapy , majority patient consider nonresponsive partially responsive . The limited success conventional treatment make identify alternative treatment priority . Although psychosurgery regard valid alternative severe refractory individual , potential serious irreversible adverse consequence significant , render treatment 'last resort ' . Repetitive TMS appear represent safe effective alternative severe sufferer . Repetitive TMS show effective therapeutic tool treatment several neuropsychiatric disorder include MDD schizophrenia , investigation utility OCD preliminary . In study 12 OCD patient single session stimulation right lateral prefrontal cortex ( 20 Hz , 80 % motor threshold , 20 minute ) result decrease compulsive urge eight hour contrast leave prefrontal cortex associate modest response . Sachdev et al randomly assign 12 individual receive right leave dorsolateral prefrontal stimulation ( 10 Hz,110 % rest motor threshold , 15 minute 5 sessions/week 2 week ) . Subjects show significant improvement two week 1-month follow-up , regardless lateralit . A randomized control trial compare right prefrontal stimulation sham treatment 18 OCD subject negative , however low frequency ( 1 Hz ) stimulation use contrast previous report ( 110 % motor threshold , 20 minute 3 times/week 6 week ) . Most recently small study 10 individual OCD and/or Tourette 's syndrome find benefit low-frequency stimulation supplementary motor area ( 1 Hz , 100 % motor threshold , 20 minute 5 sessions/week 2 week ) . Notably subject treatment-resistant Sachdev study . Thus although limited literature precludes definitive conclusion , suggest rTMS may benefit refractory OCD . In study propose investigate effectiveness rTMS treatment refractory OCD . Although ideal treatment parameter need establish , literature suggest high frequency stimulation dorsolateral prefrontal cortex likely beneficial . Bilateral stimulation use ; previous work demonstrate method safe well tolerate . Moreover patient assign randomized double-blind fashion receive either active sham TMS , allow definitive conclusion draw . We also propose explore whether induction CI mediate therapeutic effect rTMS OCD symptom .</detailed_description>
