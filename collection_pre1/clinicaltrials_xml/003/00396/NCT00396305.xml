	<brief_summary>This research study do influenza ( flu ) affect many people year throughout world . The elderly chronic health problem great risk complication flu . The purpose research study evaluate vaccination strategy elderly others receive influenza vaccination order increase protection . All subject receive flu vaccine injection muscle upper arm . Participants may receive booster [ extra dose vaccine placebo ( inactive substance ) ] shot . Study participant include healthy adult volunteer , age 21-40 , 60-89 , 90 year old . Subjects involve study related procedure 6 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Th1 Response Influenza : Aging Vaccine Efficacy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Influenza pneumonia fourth lead cause death among people age 65 year . Influenza also lead cause catastrophic disability , greatly affect quality life elderly person . In United States alone , estimate 10 billion dollar spend annually due impact influenza , rise population senior rapidly expand . Thus , influenza vaccination recommend elderly adult . Although cost-effective , influenza vaccination prevents infection 30 percent-40 percent age 65 , compare 70 percent-90 percent 65 . Reduced influenza vaccine efficacy great morbidity mortality think largely due immune senescence , underlie mechanism remain poorly understood . A good understanding immune senescence ultimately translate improve effectiveness variety vaccine , include vaccine bioterrorist attack ( small pox vaccine ) , thereby bring huge advance disease prevention billion cost saving . The commercially available influenza vaccine use United States contain inactivated split viral particle influenza B two subtypes influenza A . These vaccine cost-effective , far perfect ; 61 percent vaccinate elderly people acquire influenza infection nonetheless . The safety cost effectiveness license split influenza virus vaccine establish , reduce researcher ' incentive improve vaccine define difficult expensive-to-measure T cell-mediated immunity . The ultimate goal propose non-randomized , open-label study improve vaccine efficacy order reduce morbidity mortality influenza infectious disease elderly people . The primary objective examine safety immunogenicity vaccine strategy enhance Type 1 Helper Cells ( Th1 ) response booster peak Influenza specific ( IS ) -Th1 expansion follow first vaccination . The frequency IS-Th1 antibody level day 7 28 use two main indicator immunogenicity , although CD8+ T cell response also analyze . The safety profile assess include immediate adverse event , solicit local systemic event , unsolicited adverse event . Seventy-four healthy individual live independently community surround study site invite participate trial . Participants age 21 40 year ( young cohort ) 60 year old ( elderly cohort ) recruit . Participants consider active trial 3 month post vaccination . A telephone follow-up visit schedule 6 month post-vaccination . Four group subject recruit : 1 control group ( Group 1 ) 3 experimental group ( Group 2 , Group 3 , Group 4 ) . This study link DMID protocol 05-0125 . Protocol 05-0125 contains Part II study .</detailed_description>
