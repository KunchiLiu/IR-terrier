	<brief_summary>Traumatic event may lead strong emotional episodic memory common Post- Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) . Intense affect may inhibit efficacy glutamatergic neurotransmission two particular area limbic system implicate process emotionally charge memory : amygdala hippocampus ( 1,2 ) . Dysfunction glutamatergic neurotransmission associate disbalance long-term potentiation ( LTP ) long-term depression ( LTD ) - two underlying mechanism cooperate achieve synaptic plasticity expressations- learning memory ( 3 ) . LTP- long lasting enhancement synaptic function include change amount neurotransmitter glutamate release synapse , change level key protein synapsis , protein phosphorylation change density receptor synaptic membrane . LTD inverse LTP , long last reduction synaptic transmission ( 4 ) . Interactions among different form plasticity underlie different form memory . Normally mechanisms balance . In current literature data class I major histocompatibility complex ( MHC class I ) molecule , know important immune response antigen , express also neuron undergo activity-dependence , long-term structural synaptic modification ( 5 ) . The brain produce immune molecule , protein MHC class I CD3-zeta ( component receptor MHC class I ) . In immune system , two protein act part lock key system recognize get rid body ’ foreign invader . The CD3-zeta polypeptide component T cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) contribute efficient cell surface expression account part transduce capability ( 6 ) . In brain , may part signal system recognize eliminate inappropriate neural connection . Expression MHC class I regulate naturally occur electrical activity , sensitive natural pathological change activity . Electrical activity neuron drive establishment final pattern connection . Changes strength individual synapses potention depression lead stabilization withdrawal , respectively , affect connection . There data , mouse deficiency MHC class I CD3-zeta LTP hippocampus enhance significantly LTD absent . Thus , MHC class I crucial translate activity change synaptic strength neuronal connectivity vivo . He require normal activity dependent potentiation , depression , removal inappropriate connection respond injury CNS ( 6 ) . Glutamate receptor play critical role LTP/LTD mechanism . Some researcher consider key role pathogenesis PTSD play excessive excitation NMDA-receptors limbic system structure ( 1 ) . The exist data allows assume , equation plasticity mechanisms depend mutual relation MHC class I glutamate receptor . T-cells , like neuron , express high level glutamate receptor identical brain glutamate receptor . Presence ionotropic metabotropic glutamate receptor membranes lymphocyte make sensitive alarm molecule operate neuronal activity . Glutamate trigger several T-cell activation differs quantitatively qualitatively one trigger “ classical ’ T-cell activator like antigen ( 7 ) . There data influence T cell receptor-CD3 complex- expression T-cells glutamate receptor ( 8 ) . It possible , key role function play CD3-zeta .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Working hypothesis aim Trauma-related LTP/LTD disbalance favor potentaion excessive excitation glutamate receptor generate arouse experience occur conjunction memory-related activation hippocampus amigdala . Traumatic memory connect amplification mechanism LTP , new information unable induce reliable LTD , reverse synaptic plasticity form previous emotional learning experience . MHC class I CD3-zeta play key role change . We assume composition glutamate receptor CD3-zeta expression T-cells use model reflect LTP/LTD balance CNS . The work include learn follow parameter : 1 . The Expression T-cells : glutamate receptor , CD3-zeta . 2 . Glutamate level plasma 3 . Cytokines level plasma : 1. interferon-γ induce component class I MHC ( 9 ) . 2. tumor necrosis factor-α influence AMPAR expression play role LTP reduction ( 10 ) . Groups ( 20 people ) make patient priori various degree LTP/LTD balance : healthy people PTSD patient . People suffer PTSD , frequently condition , brightly deeply experience event injuring . The memoir paint painful emotion , seize attention person seem experience injure event see real . We assume , connect unable induce reliable LTD , composition glutamate receptor CD3-zeta expression T-cells people differ healthy . Used method : enzyme- link immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) , FACS</detailed_description>
