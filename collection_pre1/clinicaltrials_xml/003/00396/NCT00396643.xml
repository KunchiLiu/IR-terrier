	<detailed_description>1 . Aims study The principal aim test 1.2 g/day EPA/DHA prevent transition first-episode psychosis 13-25 year old ultra-high risk individual . Specifically propose investigate : - The clinical effect EPA/DHA supplementation adjunct standard therapy individual 'At-Risk Mental State ' ( ARMS ) psychosis define PACE criterion ( Yung et al. , 1998 ) . - Lipid metabolism peripheral tissue pre/post treatment 1./analyzing bioactive lipid composition red-blood cell membrane , 2./measuring phospholipase A2 ( cPLA2 ) activity serum ( enzyme responsible cleavage arachidonic acid ( AA ) precursor bioactive lipid glycerophospholipids ( GPL ) 3./the topical niacin flush test ( clinical test AA-prostaglandin D2 cascade ) . 2 . Background evidence bioactive lipid alter schizophrenia influence EPA/DHA supplementation There suggestion early intervention psychosis might associate good outcome ( Norman &amp; Malla , 2001 ) . However , intervention pre-psychotic phase question , use current criterion , 20-50 % individual classify prodromal develop psychotic disorder within 1-2 year period ( McGlashan et al. , 2001 ) . Treatment agent investigate pre-psychotic phase schizophrenia psychotic disorder , therefore , major side effect . This proposal introduce EPA/DHA , two omega-3 essential fatty acid ( EFA ) , beneficial possible preventative therapeutic agent young people ultra high-risk develop psychotic disorder . Bioactive lipid role brain Bioactive lipid molecules intra- intercellular role , include mediation , modulation control neurobiological process , ion channel receptor activity , neurotransmitter release , synaptic plasticity , second messenger pathways neuronal gene expression ( Agranoff et al. , 1998 ) . Emphasis place AA metabolite , know collectively eicosanoids . A major proportion lipid brain consist bioactive lipid AA metabolite , also refer EFA , mainly bound GPL . Bioactive lipid release direct indirect enzymatic pathway ( e.g. , phospholipases ) membrane GPL . AA precursor prostaglandin , thromboxanes , leukotriens ( 5-HpETE ) prostacyclins . Animal study preliminary study human show association bioactive lipid metabolism , behaviour cognition ( Zimmer et al. , 2000 ) . Reduced membrane EFA schizophrenia Abnormal membrane GPL EFA metabolism suggest contribute aetiopathophysiology schizophrenia . A recent review 15 publish study confirm depletion bioactive lipid cell membrane patient schizophrenia ( Fenton et al. , 2000 ) . The consistent finding reduction AA precursor , independent drug treatment ( Yao et al. , 1996 ) . Reductions AA precursor also find post mortem brain patient schizophrenia , relative normal control brain [ Yao et al. , 2000 ] . Yao van Kammen ( 1996 ) suggest defective uptake AA membrane GPL possible aetiopathological mechanism schizophrenia , whereas Peet et al . ( 1996 ) , report additional increase EFA peroxidation product , suggest increase breakdown membrane GPL . Khan et al . ( 2002 ) report erythrocyte membrane EFA level level plasma lipid peroxide , product damage EFAs , drug-naive patient within +/-4.5 day onset psychosis . The level EFAs , particularly AA docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) significantly low drug-naive patient onset psychosis compare match normal control . These low EFA level associate significantly high level lipid peroxide patient . The level AA DHA also low lipid peroxide higher chronic medicated patient normal control . Interestingly context proposal , EFA level higher chronic medicated patient drug-naive first-episode patient . Khan et al . conclude finding could indicate low membrane AA DHA likely predate illness probably contribute onset illness . The lipid peroxidation data suggest possible increase oxidative stress may one mechanism reduce membrane EFAs . The finding also imply supplementation EFAs and/or antioxidant might provide effective treatment early psychosis . This view support Horrobin et al . ( 2002 ) show increase red cell AA level result treatment optimal level EPA , clinical improvement highly significantly positively correlated rise red cell membrane AA individual schizophrenia . Treatment study schizophrenia Three randomize control treatment study conduct 12 week find 2g/day EPA significantly effective placebo reduce psychopathological symptom individual schizophrenia ( Peet et al. , 2001 ; Emsley et al. , 2002 ) . Symptom improvement study , clinically relevant statistically significant . A dose-ranging exploratory study effect EPA individual schizophrenia experienced persistent symptom find 2 g EPA/day significantly effective reduce symptom score psychiatric rating scale 1g 4g EPA/day ( Peet et al. , 2002 ) . On hand , Fenton et al . ( 2002 ) investigate augmentation neuroleptic 3 g/day EPA symptom cognition patient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder report negative finding . The patient Fenton et al.s ' study , however , ill two decade substantial symptom , despite treatment newer neuroleptic , include clozapine . The patient describe benefit EPA study younger short duration illness . It must emphasize EPA treatment study , treatment-related side effect adverse biochemical haematological effect observe . EPA prove safe administer schizophrenic patient adjunct therapy . EPA cause side effect mild gastrointestinal symptom , enhance side effect exist drug . Patients find EPA highly tolerable . The proportion patient complete 12 week ( 89 % ) compare favourably mean withdrawal rate 54 % novel neuroleptic group 67 % placebo group trial FDA database ( Peet et al. , 2002 ) . Acceptance substance normally find human body without significant side effect , potency potentially similar antipsychotic drug early phase psychotic disorder could contribute reduce duration untreated psychosis increase compliance . 3 . Study design We use prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , single-centre study design . Eighty one individual age 13-25 randomly assign two treatment condition University Clinic Child Adolescent Neuropsychiatry , Vienna , Austria . Randomization code generate stored site . The treatment group receive 1.2 gramm per day EPA/DHA placebo 12 week . Follow-up assessment conduct 1,2,3,4,8,12,26 , 52 week . All patient receive standard treatment , include management psychiatrist resident psychiatrist non-neuroleptic pharmacotherapy clinically indicate .</detailed_description>
