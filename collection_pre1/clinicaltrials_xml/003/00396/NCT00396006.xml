	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effect weekly augmentation therapy ARALAST Fraction IV-1 ( Fr IV-1 ) epithelial lining fluid ( ELF ) alpha 1-proteinase inhibitor level ELF analytes assess safety treatment . Eligible subject diagnosis severe congenital alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency receive 8 consecutive weekly treatment 60 mg/kg/week functional ARALAST Fr IV-1 administer intravenously . The efficacy safety assessment include two bronchoscopies bronchoalveolar lavage study initiation study termination multiple image laboratory safety assessment . Each subject participate minimum 12 week .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Signed date informed consent . Male female 18 year age old . Documented , endogenous serum α1PI level &lt; 40 mg/dL measure screening ( unless otherwise approve Sponsor ) minimum 28day washout prior replacement therapy ( applicable ) . Phenotype Pi Z ( include Pi*Z/Z , Pi*Z/Null , Pi*Malton/Z ) , Pi*Null/Null . Pulmonary function screen meeting follow criterion : 1 . Forced expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) &gt; = 50 % predict value ; 2 . FEV1 &gt; 35 % predict value diffuse capacity carbon monoxide &gt; 45 % predicated value , supplemental oxygen therapy &lt; 3 pulmonary exacerbation bronchitis require antibiotics/corticosteroids within past 12 month ) . For female childbearing potential , negative urine test pregnancy within 7 day prior first bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) visit agreement employ adequate birth control measure duration study . No clinically significant abnormality detect 12lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) perform screen visit ( ECG previously obtain within past 12 month may use , available ) . Laboratory result obtain screen visit , meet follow criterion : 1 . Serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; = 2 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) 2 . Serum aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &lt; = 2 time ULN 3 . Serum total bilirubin &lt; = 2 time ULN 4 . Proteinuria &lt; +2 dipstick analysis 5 . Serum creatinine &lt; = 1.5 time ULN 6 . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; = 1500 cells/mm3 7 . Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) &gt; = 10.0 g/dL 8 . Platelet count &gt; = 105/mm3 If subject treat respiratory medication , inhale bronchodilator inhaled corticosteroid , chronic medication treatment subjects´s medical condition ( ) , subject 's medication dose unchanged least 14 day prior baseline BAL visit . Clinically significant pulmonary impairment , chronic pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . The subject receive alpha 1 proteinase inhibitor ( α1PI ) augmentation therapy ( e.g. , Prolastin , Zemaira , Aralast , investigational α1PI , route include intravenous inhale ) within 28 day prior screen . The subject receive investigational drug device within 1 month prior screening , subject currently receive investigational drug device . If subject receive another investigational drug device enrollment , subject withdraw trial . Presence clinical symptom low respiratory tract infection acute pulmonary exacerbation within 14 day prior screen . The subject know selective Immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) deficiency ( IgA level le 15 mg/dL ) and/or antibody IgA . The subject pregnant lactating , intend become pregnant course study . The subject suitable candidate BAL procedure . Moderate severe bronchiectasis ( total daily sputum production &gt; 10 mL ) . Clinically significant medical , psychiatric , cognitive illness , recreational drug/alcohol use , opinion investigator , would affect subject safety compliance . Prior history adverse reaction local anaesthetic , sedative , pain control drug , medication employ study center perioperative care associate BAL procedure . Longterm use oral parenteral glucocorticosteroid within 28 day prior screen .</criteria>
