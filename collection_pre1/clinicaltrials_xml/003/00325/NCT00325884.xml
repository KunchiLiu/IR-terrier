	<brief_summary>The purpose study ass long-term clinical outcome stenting bifurcation coronary artery lesion , determine whether simple complex technique associate well clinical outcome . We also assess risk factor associate poor clinical outcome</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-term Outcomes Patients After Coronary Bifurcation Stenting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary artery disease affect branch point coronary artery ( bifurcation lesion ) high rate restenosis angioplasty disease region involve branch point . Post-procedural angiographic outcome in-hospital outcome document variety technique , none examine long-term clinical outcome . Long-term clinical outcome important patient point view also determine use resource . Knowledge long-term outcome various technique use treat bifurcation lesion would important determine guideline treatment bifurcation lesion . If simple technique offer similar good outcome complex strategy , would justify simpler technique main vessel stenting would use less resource , expose patient less radiation , contrast relate prolonged angioplasty procedure . Comparisons : We compare long-term outcome simple versus complex stent technique , determine risk factor long-term outcome</detailed_description>
