	<brief_title>Diabetes Risk Evaluation Management Tele-monitoring Study ( DREAM-Tel )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Diabetes mellitus systemic disease produce diverse array complication . The pathogenesis complication refers back two factor , one ( high blood glucose ) alters proteins lead tissue blood vessel damage , ( high blood pressure ) , exacerbate vascular damage cause damage target organ . Our long term goal achieve target blood glucose blood pressure outline Clinical Practice Guidelines . Despite current Clinical Practice Guidelines evidence-based practice medical community , include family physicians Home Care team , blood glucose control general First Nations community specifically meet target . Poor control blood glucose type 2 diabetes dramatically increase risk heart disease , stroke , vascular limb loss , blindness , kidney disease need dialysis . Control blood glucose level prevents complication . Additionally , intensification diabetes control , include initiation insulin , easily do regular primary care visit . The lack intensification diabetes management people poorly control diabetes refer 'clinical inertia ' . While subject referred specialist somewhat good control diabetes , 50 % still fail intensification diabetes management within four month lab report show high level A1c . Multidisciplinary care overcome clinical inertia , even difficult practice setting . Finally , emerge technology Bluetooth-enabled device secure web-based monitoring log allow health care provider first time remotely monitor progress provide high level confidence self blood glucose monitoring ( SBGM ) blood pressure result . Based fact , experimental focus proposal introduction Home Care Team diabetes management program provide intensification diabetes management right patient 's home , support emerge technology Bluetooth- enable device . The specific aim design provide comprehensive assessment impact introduction program .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Type 2 Diabetes baseline A1c &gt; 8.0 % diet medical therapy history diabetic ketoacidosis . Patients must great equal 18 year age . Written informed consent must obtain prior admission study . Hypoglycemic therapy A1c &lt; 8.0 % New York Heart Association Stage IIIIV congestive heart failure . This eliminate approximately 2 % people diabetes base Strong Heart Study Data . Suspected secondary hypertension due cause ( e.g . pheochromocytoma , coarction aorta renal insufficiency . ) Unstable angina , myocardial infarction , revascularization within last 3 month . Angioedema . Cerebrovascular event , include stroke transient ischemic attack , within last six month . Creatinine &gt; 250 umol/L Cerebral Vascular event , include strike transient ischemic attack , within last six month . Connective tissue disorder ( e.g.lupus , rheumatoid arthritis ) Active hepatic disease indicate AST ALT &gt; 2X upper limit normal ; serum bilirubin &gt; 1.5X upper limit normal , serum albumin &lt; 3.0 gm/dl . Severe systemic malignant disease ( could reasonably expect fatal lifethreatening course study . ) Pregnancy . It expect woman want exit study become pregnant ( 5 % female enrollee ) . Factors suggest low likelihood compliance protocol ( e.g current alcohol abuse , history unreliability keep appointment take medication . Any medical condition study physician believe would interfere study participation evaluation result . Mental incapacity and/or cognitive impairment part patient would preclude adequate understanding , cooperation , study protocol . Participation clinical trial investigational medication within 3 month prior trial . This unlikely clinical trial among First Nations people rare .</criteria>
