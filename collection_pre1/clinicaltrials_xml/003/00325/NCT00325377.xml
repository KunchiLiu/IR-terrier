	<brief_title>The Effects MME Procedure Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pilot study conduct AMRI International suggest 0.5T static magnetic field energy supply investigational device Magnetic Molecular Energizer ( MME ) may effective relieve chronic low back pain persistent despite conventional therapy . This study randomize , sham-controlled trial intend show whether MME intervention effective , well tolerate intervention reduction pain , pain related symptom improve ability function diagnose condition , chronic low back pain . The MME procedure consist lay treatment bed individual 's body position two large , electromagnetic coil create strong ( 0.3T - 0.5T ) magnetic field pass body . The device bear superficial resemblance open MRI machine . The field focus low back area . The total intervention time study 140 hr MME exposure , consist 8 - 12 hrs per day 12 - 18 consecutive day night . Participants assess prior start intervention history physical exam conduct one physician investigator , assess pain level use visual analogue pain scale , assess functional ability use Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index questionnaire assessment cutaneous perception threshold ( CPT ) use Neurometer device . Pain scale level assess daily throughout intervention period . At conclusion intervention period , CPT test repeat . One month intervention , Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index questionnaire mail participant . The final evaluation six month intervention . The participant return clinic repeat CPT testing , report pain level complete Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Index questionnaire . The targeted enrollment trial 100 participant . The participant randomize 50 receive active procedure 50 receive sham procedure . The sham procedure provide MME device disable machine appear turn , magnetic field produce . When final post-intervention follow-up complete participant inform whether receive active sham procedure . Those received sham procedure offer receive active procedure desire . The evaluation repeat cross-over group , data report separately main trial result . Participants ask discontinue usual medication treatment low back pain . Medication usage assess see change usage pattern associate procedure .</detailed_description>
