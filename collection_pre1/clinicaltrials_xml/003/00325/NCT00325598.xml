	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria 1 . Histologic Documentation : Patients histologically confirm Unicentric Stage I ( T1 N0 M0 ) invasive ductal breast cancer . Histologically negative tumor margin 2 mm ink edge , tumor reexcision specimen final shave specimen . Tubular , mucinous medullary variant histology infiltrate ductal carcinoma permit . Lowgrade DCIS ( I II ) 2 cm less histologically negative margin least 2 mm margin ( negative reexcision ) permit . Women age 70 year old T1 invasive ductal carcinoma estrogenreceptor positive ( ER+ ) clinically negative axillary node undergo surgical lymph node evaluation also eligible patient take hormonal therapy . Patients T1N0 ( i+ ) tumor sentinel lymph node map dissection ( i.e . tumor deposit 0.2mm less , regardless whether deposit detect IHC H &amp; E staining ) also eligible , provided completion axillary dissection perform confirm N0 status . In case invasive cancer present , invasive cancer 's pathology use regardless DCIS also present . 2 . Prior Treatment : Patient may treat adjuvant chemotherapy . Patients may adjuvant hormonal therapy begin hormonal therapy follow XRT discretion medical oncologist . Radiation therapy begin within : 412 week definitive surgical procedure 26 week chemotherapy , chemotherapy give first Radiation deliver concurrently chemotherapy . 3 . Age &gt; = 18 year age 4 . ECOG Performance Status 02 . 5 . Signed Informed Consent Exclusion Criteria The following guideline assist physician select patient protocol therapy safe appropriate . Physicians recognize follow may seriously increase risk patient enter protocol . Patients meet follow criterion enter study : 1a Multicentric IDC breast define discontiguous tumor separate least 5 cm uninvolved tissue ; alternatively , discontiguous tumor clinically mammographically within separate breast quadrant subareolar central region . 1. b Multifocal IDC breast , define discontiguous discrete focus invasive carcinoma , separate uninvolved intervening tissue , within overall span 5cm , within breast quadrant subareolar central region . 2 . Tumor &gt; 2.0 cm , nodal involvement H &amp; E staining , metastatic involvement 3 . Histological evidence : 1 . Lymphovascular invasion : defined tumor embolus present endotheliallined space ; case tumor emboli present space line endothelial cell otherwise suspicious angiolymphatic space also consider ineligible . 2 . EIC ( Extensive Intraductal Component ) : define presence intraductal carcinoma within primary infiltrate ductal tumor ( comprise least 25 % tumor area ) intraductal carcinoma present clearly beyond edge invasive tumor , predominantly intraductal tumor one area focal invasion 7 , 55 . 3 . Invasive Lobular Carcinoma 4 . Infiltrating carcinoma mixed ductal lobular feature : case ambiguous mixed histologic feature show positive Ecadherin stain throughout tumor immunohistochemistry classify ductal type consider eligible 56 , 57 . 5 . Infiltrating papillary carcinoma 6 . Margins : Insitu invasive carcinoma present le 2 mm inked resection margin . 4 . History cosmetic reconstructive breast surgery 5 . Psychiatric illness would prevent patient give informed consent . Medical condition uncontrolled infection ( include HIV ) , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus connective tissue disease ( lupus , systemic sclerosis collagen vascular disease ) , opinion treat physician , would make protocol unreasonably hazardous patient . 6 . Patients `` currently active '' second malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer . Patients consider `` currently active '' malignancy complete therapy consider physician less 5 % risk relapse within three year . 7 . Patients diffuse ( &gt; 1 quadrant &gt; 5cm ) suspicious microcalcifications 8 . Women pregnant .</criteria>
