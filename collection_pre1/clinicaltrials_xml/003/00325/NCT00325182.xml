	<detailed_description>Alcoholism chronic disease numerous psychological , social medical consequence . Alcohol use disorder one prevalent psychiatric disorder general population US . Alcoholism disrupt individual 's life , health ability function society , tremendous impact family community , also associate enormous economic cost society .

Similarly , currently available pharmacological treatment alcohol use disorder associate moderate efficacy , indicate effort require develop novel intervention . The rewarding effect alcohol least partially mediate via dopamine pathway originate ventral tegmental area project nucleus accumbens . Alcohol effect GABA receptor activity decrease inhibitory effect GABA dopaminergic neuron ventral tegmental area therefore facilitate dopamine neurotransmission . Medications modulate excitatory neurotransmission brain ( glutamate ) facilitate inhibitory effect GABA show clinically effective treatment alcoholism . Keppra novel antiepileptic medication currently approve treatment partial onset seizure adjunctive agent . It unique mechanism action reduces negative allosteric effect Zn++ Beta- carboline two main inhibitory receptor CNS- GABA A glycine receptor . These modulators inhibit influx chloride though receptor complex therefore consider excitatory mediator . Keppra prevents negative modulation promotes chloride flux , thereby , inhibit neurotransmission . Limited laboratory work levetiracetam ( Keppra ) show medication reverse anxiogenic effect benzodiazepine withdrawal mouse ( Y. Lamberty et al. , 2002 ) . Furthermore , Keppra investigate potential prevent alcohol withdrawal symptom mouse . In study levetiracetam dose-dependently prevent spontaneous tremor handle induced convulsion alcohol dependent mouse . ( Y. Lamberty et al. , 2002 ) . Based mechanism action Keppra hypothesize may effective promote abstinence reduce drink behavior alcohol dependent patient .</detailed_description>
