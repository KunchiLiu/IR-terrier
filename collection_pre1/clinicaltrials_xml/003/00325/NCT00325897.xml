	<brief_title>Macrolide Azithromycin Prevent Rapid Worsening Symptoms Associated With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The prevalence , morbidity , mortality , treatment cost COPD high increase . COPD sixth lead cause death worldwide condition top 10 cause death increase prevalence mortality . The cost health care patient COPD U.S. approximately $ 6.5 billion per year ; acute exacerbation account 31 % 68 % cost . Macrolide antibiotic may reduce frequency and/or severity COPD exacerbation , result antibacterial property anti-inflammatory effect . Long-term administration macrolide antibiotic patient number pulmonary disorder result clinically important improvement . It hypothesize administration macrolide antibiotic ( azithromycin ) 1 year , add usual care , decrease frequency severity COPD exacerbation . If hypothesis correct , propose treatment also expect reduce mortality COPD patient . DESIGN NARRATIVE : This prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study enroll 1130 patient least moderately severe COPD , base clinical indicator , increase likelihood experience acute exacerbation study period . Patients monitor monthly , include careful assessment possible macrolide-related side effect . The exclusion criterion study include variety condition medication know adversely interact macrolides . The primary endpoint study time first acute COPD exacerbation . The secondary endpoint include macrolide-related side effect , incidence macrolide-resistant bacterial colonization , quality life , cost-effectiveness .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis least moderate Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) , define follow Global Initiative COPD ( GOLD ) criterion : 1 . Postbronchodilator force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) /forced vital capacity ( FVC ) ratio le 70 % 2 . Postbronchodilator FEV1 le 80 % predict , without chronic symptom Cigarette consumption 10 packyears ( may may active smoker ) Meets one follow four condition : 1 . Current , history , supplemental O2 use 2 . Received course systemic corticosteroid respiratory problem within 1 year prior study entry 3 . Visited emergency department COPD exacerbation within 1 year prior study entry 4 . Hospitalized COPD exacerbation within 1 year prior study entry Willing make return visit Available telephone duration study Minimum 4 week recent acute exacerbation ( received course systemic corticosteroid , increase dose chronically administer systemic corticosteroid , and/or antibiotic acute exacerbation minimum 4 week time study entry ) Diagnosis asthma Diagnosis COPD result patient either medically unstable , predicted life expectancy le 3 year Special patient group ( i.e. , prisoner , pregnant woman , institutionalized patient ) Women risk become pregnant study ( premenopausal ) refuse use acceptable birth control ( i.e. , hormonebased oral barrier contraceptive ) duration study History hypersensitivity macrolide antibiotic Taking following medication : 1 . Cisapride 2 . Ergot derivatives 3 . Pimozide 4 . Disopyramide 5 . Cyclosporin 6 . Tacrolimus 7 . Nelfinavir 8 . Bromocriptine 9 . Hexobarbital Corrected QT interval ( QTc ) electrocardiogram exceed 440 m Taking rifabutin rifampin Chronic hepatic insufficiency Chronic renal insufficiency Diagnosis bronchiectasis ( define production great onehalf cup purulent sputum/day ) If , either ear , formal audiometric test sound booth result pure tone average ( i.e. , average threshold 4 frequency 1000 , 2000 , 3000 , 4000 ) exceed 50 decibel ( dB ) , threshold one frequency exceed 60 dB , participant counsel audiologist concern hearing aid and/or referral otolaryngologist . In addition , audiologist may discuss participant whether continue study . Following examination counseling , participant also discuss whether continue study one study investigator . If find participant 's pure tone average two ears differs 15 dB , difference two ears one frequency exceed 20 dB , participant eligible randomization study unless clear otolaryngologist</criteria>
