	<brief_summary>This study identify biomarkers ( gene protein ) patient relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis ( MS ) link clinical disease parameter , extent inflammation rate disease progression , try good understand disease . It examine biomarkers may relate disease development progression difference among patient ' symptom response treatment . Patients relapsing-remitting MS 18 60 year age enrol multi-institutional MS-CombiRx trial may eligible sub-study . Participants blood test enter MS-CombiRx study 6 month , 1 year , 3 year analysis genetic protein analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : To identify biomarkers ( gene- protein expression profiling , single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) haplotype determination , HLA type ) link clinical- MRI phenotype large cohort relapsing-remitting ( RR- ) MS patient . To identify biomarkers separate MS patient healthy , matched control . STUDY POPULATION : Up 1000 patient enrol treated multi-center trial combination therapy ( MS-CombiRx ) use two approve disease-modifying therapy ( interferon-beta , IFN-b , Avonex ; glatiramer-acetate , GA ) single treatment combination . 200 healthy , match control individual . DESIGN : Samples serum white blood cell obtain patient prior randomization MS-CombiRx study 6 month 1 , 3 year follow randomization . Samples analyze SNP haplotype , gene protein expression , HLA haplotype . Samples control analyzed fashion , however , one time point analyze , treatment control . OUTCOME MEASURES : The result biomarker study assess relationship clinical MRI phenotype baseline change disability , relapse rate , response therapy change MRI measure disease 3-year treatment period . Each biomarker study component analyze respect biomarkers discriminate MS patient control . SIGNIFICANCE : Similar rheumatoid arthritis autoimmune diabetes multiple sclerosis ( MS ) consider complex disease autoimmune pathogenesis well vulnerability target tissue , i.e . central nervous system ( CNS ) . The result biomarker study provide good understanding disease pathogenesis , inter-individual disease heterogeneity , finally identify biomarkers gene- protein expression signature individual gene protein correlate responsiveness non-responsiveness single drug treatment combination two drug . The three year duration combination therapy trial allow u gather information longitudinal evolution identify biomarkers treatment MS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA PATIENTS : To eligible entry study , candidate must meet following eligibility criterion time enrollment : Between age 18 60 year , inclusive . Diagnosis RelapsingRemitting MS . Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) score 0 5.5 , inclusive . At least 2 exacerbation prior three year ; one exacerbation may utilize McDonald MRI criterion dissemination time ( new Gdenhancing lesion demonstrate scan do least 3 month follow onset clinical attack new T2 lesion Gdenhancing lesion followup scan additional 3 month ) . Give write informed consent prior test protocol , include screen test evaluation consider part subject 's routine care . EXCLUSION CRITERIA PATIENTS : Candidates exclude study entry follow exclusion criterion exist time screening ( prior randomization ) : Prior use interferon beta glatiramer acetate . Acute exacerbation within 30 day screen . Steroids acute exacerbation ( great 100 mg/day ) within 30 day study entrance chronic systemic steroid use . Evidence progressive MS. Use immunosuppressive chemotherapeutic agent IVIg . Inability perform MSFC ( Time 25Foot Walk , 9HPT , PASAT3 ) . Inability undergo baseline MRI scan . History significant cardiac , hepatic , pulmonary , renal disease ; immune deficiency ; medical condition would preclude therapy interferon beta glatiramer acetate . Known history sensitivity gadopentate dimeglumine mannitol . History seizure within 3 month prior randomization . History suicidal ideation episode severe depression within 3 month prior randomization . Abnormal screen blood test exceed limit define : Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) aspartate transaminase ( AST ) great two time upper limit normal ( i.e. , great 2 time ULN ) . Total white blood cell count le 2,300/mm ( 3 ) . Platelet count le 80,000/mm ( 3 ) . Creatinine great 2 time ULN . Participation another experimental clinical trial , without formal approval . Previous participation randomization study . History alcohol drug abuse within 2 year prior randomization . Female subject currently pregnant , breastfeed , plan become pregnant . For female subject , unless postmenopausal surgically sterile , unwillingness practice effective contraception , define investigator , study . The rhythm method use sole method contraception . Unwillingness inability comply requirement protocol include presence condition likely affect subject 's returning schedule followup visit schedule ( physical , mental , social condition , include history episode suicidal ideation severe depression define episode require hospitalization within previous 3 month ) . INCLUSION CRITERIA CONTROLS : 18 60 year inclusive . EXCLUSION CRITERIA CONTROLS : Any significant acute chronic illness , particularly autoimmune chronic inflammatory , infectious disease .
