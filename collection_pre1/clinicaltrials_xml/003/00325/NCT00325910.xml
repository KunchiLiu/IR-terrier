	<brief_title>Patients With Heart Failure ANd Type 2 Diabetes Treated With Placebo Or Metformin ( PHANTOM ) Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Heart failure ( HF ) common complication type 2 diabetes mellitus . There limited treatment option patient HF diabetes . Although metformin consider safe effective medication , currently recommend patient HF due perceive increased risk lactic acidosis . There increase evidence suggest HF predispose patient increase risk metformin induce lactic acidosis . Moreover , recent observational research show metformin may associate reduced morbidity mortality diabetic HF patient compare sulfonylurea therapy . Study Purpose : To conduct pilot study evaluate feasibility large randomize control trial ( RCT ) metformin patient heart failure type 2 diabetes generate initial morbidity mortality estimate patient population . Study Design : A multi-centre prospective triple blind randomize placebo control trial ( RCT ) design . Subjects recruit specialist clinic ( e.g. , heart failure clinic , diabetes clinic ) , inpatient hospital admissions/emergency room visit physician referral Capital Health Region . Subjects : All subject physician-diagnosed symptomatic heart failure ( NYHA class I , II , III , IV ) type 2 diabetes eligible study . All subject follow condition exclude study : subject currently receive great 1500 mg metformin therapy per day ; subject unwilling change antidiabetic regimen ; subject receive insulin therapy ; serum creatinine ≥ 180 μmol/L ; A1c &lt; 7.0 percent ; inability communicate ( language barrier ) ; dementia/mental illness ; age &lt; 18 year ; subject unwilling complete self monitoring serum blood sugar trial period ; participate another heart failure diabetes clinical trial involve medication ; severe comorbidities foreshorten life expectancy ; subject provide write informed consent participate . Research Plan : Approximately 100 subject randomly assign either metformin placebo therapy . It anticipate enrollment pilot study could accomplish within 12 month . Subjects prospectively follow 6 month duration part pilot study . At time hospital discharge initial clinic visit , subject provide educational package heart failure type 2 diabetes . They also provide medication Dosette help maintain compliance medication clinical event diary record clinical event community set . To avoid medication intolerance , dose study medication titrate slowly 2 week period community . Research coordinator contact subject weekly first 2 week recommend dosage titration warrant . All subject complete six minute walk baseline final 6 month follow-up visit . Throughout study , subject contact monthly interval assessment clinical endpoint . Subjects return heart function clinic 3 6 month clinical assessment complete laboratory blood work . In addition , health relate quality life measure ( i.e. , EQ5D , KCCQ , RAND12 ) also collect baseline 6 month final follow-up visit . Study outcomes : The primary outcome study combine endpoint all-cause mortality cause-hospitalization . Secondary endpoint include individualized component primary outcome , development lactic acidosis require urgent medical attention , change A1c , change six minute walk , change health relate quality life measure . Data Analysis : As pilot/feasibility stuy , sample size 100 patient select . An priori probability commit type 1 error ( i.e. , alpha level ) 0.05 applied test statistical significance . All analysis conduct intention treat perspective . Invesigators , patient , data analyst blind treatment assignment . The primary outcome ( all-cause mortality hospitalization ) , secondary outcome individual component , risk development lactic acidosis assess use relative risk ( RR ) calculation . Secondary outcome change A1c value , six minute walk , health relate quality life baseline 6 month assess use analysis variance .</detailed_description>
