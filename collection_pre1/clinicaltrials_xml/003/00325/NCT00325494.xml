	<brief_title>A Study MORAb-009 Subjects With Pancreatic Cancer , Mesothelioma , Certain Types Ovarian Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MORAb-009 high-affinity monoclonal antibody raise human mesothelin , membrane glycoprotein think involve cell adhesion tightly associate range cancer . It show mesothelin over-expressed pancreatic cancer , mesothelioma , ovarian mesothelin-expressing ovarian non-small cell lung cancer , show little expression normal tissue . Preclinical experiment indicate MORAb-009 potentially useful anti-cancer agent . This clinical trial perform determine safety MORAb-009 subject mesothelin-expressing tumor , well establish serum pharmacokinetics antibody , assess tumor antigen may serve predictor response MORAb-009 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Female male subject , ≥ 18 year age , histologically confirm diagnosis pancreatic adenocarcinoma , mesothelioma , mesothelinpositive ovarian nonsmall cell lung cancer . As nearly 100 % pancreatic adenocarcinoma mesothelioma express mesothelin , immunohistochemical confirmation mesothelinpositivity necessary . Subject must disease , define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) evaluable clinical signs/symptoms ( e.g. , ascites , pleural effusion , lesion less 2 cm ) support biomarker , radiologic , pathologic study conduct within 4 week prior study entry . Subject must fail least one standard chemotherapy regimen . Patients pancreatic cancer must receive gemcitabine part prior therapy consider refractory , case ovarian cancer consider platinum refractory resistant . Life expectancy ≥ 3 month , estimate investigator . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 , 1 2 . Female subject childbearing potential male subject must consent use medically acceptable method contraception throughout study period 28 day MORAb009 administration . A barrier method contraception must include . Other significant medical condition must well control stable opinion investigator least 30 day prior Study Day 1 . Laboratory clinical result within 2 week prior Study Day 1 follow : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 x 109/L ; Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L ; Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL ; Serum bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL ; Aspartate transaminase ( AST ) ≤ 5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; Alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤ 5 x ULN ; Alkaline Phosphatase ≤ 5 x ULN ; Serum creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL . If elevation liver function due obstruction common bile duct extrinsic liver , subject may enrol discretion investigator even elevation great limit . Stenting reduce liver function qualify level permit . Subject must willing able provide write informed consent . Known central nervous system ( CNS ) tumor involvement . Evidence active malignancy require treatment . Clinically significant heart disease ( e.g. , congestive heart failure New York Heart Association Class III IV , angina well controlled medication , myocardial infarction within 6 month ) . ECG demonstrate clinically significant arrhythmia ( Note : Subjects chronic atrial arrhythmia , i.e. , atrial fibrillation paroxysmal SVT , eligible ) . Active serious systemic disease , include active bacterial fungal infection . Active hepatitis HIV infection . Treatment within three month immunomodulatory therapy ( e.g . interferon , immunoglobulin therapy , IL1RA systemic corticosteroid ) . Short term systemic corticosteroid topical intraarticular steroid acceptable , subject judgment investigator . Chemotherapy , biologic therapy , immunotherapy within 3 week prior dose MORAb009 . Breastfeeding , pregnant , likely become pregnant study .</criteria>
