	<brief_summary>The research aim study effect DHA ( component fish oil ) patient Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis ( PSC ) . Our hypothesis DHA might reverse problem associate PSC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation DHA Treatment PSC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The etiology Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis ( PSC ) unknown . There proven effective therapy early marker disease predict patient colitis may risk develop PSC . Our group demonstrate increase prevalence CFTR allele ( gene responsible Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) ) patient PSC correlate decreased CFTR function measure Nasal Potential Difference Testing . These data suggest colitis set CFTR dysfunction may lead bile duct inflammation fibrosis . As proof concept , subsequently demonstrate cftr-/- mouse ( 1 ) colitis lead development bile duct injury ( 2 ) prevent correction CFTR relate fatty acid defect oral Docosahexaenoic Acid ( DHA ) . Preliminary data mouse indicate low PPAR expression liver may predispose inflammation . One mechanism DHA ameliorate innate inflammatory response link CFTR dysfunction may increase PPAR expression . Based data , hypothesize CFTR dysfunction may contribute pathogenesis primary sclerosing cholangitis ( PSC ) . Furthermore , correction fatty acid abnormality change innate immune response associate CFTR dysfunction oral administration docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid , might effective therapy patient PSC . Immediate Objectives : To evaluate effect DHA therapy patient PSC , examine : Primary Outcome : • serum alkaline phosphatase Secondary Outcomes : - cholangiography - liver biochemistry ( ALT , AST , gamma-glutamyl transferase , bilirubin , albumin , prothrombin time , ) - fatty acid profile ( docosahexaenoic acid , arachidonic acid ) - serum/plasma liver fibrosis marker ( hyaluronic acid , tumor necrosis factor-α , transform growth factor-ß , type III procollagen peptide ) - innate immune response ( peripheral blood monocyte assessment cytokine secretion , lipoxins , PPAR ) - clinical data sign symptom</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must diagnosis primary sclerosing cholangitis . The diagnosis require chronic cholestatic liver disease least 6 month ' duration ; serum alkaline phosphatase level least 1.5 time upper limit normal ; cholangiographic finding intrahepatic extrahepatic biliaryduct obstruction , beading , narrow consistent PSC ; liver biopsy previous 12 month compatible finding . Age less than18 year 80 year . Subjects must evidence secondary cholangitis liver disease ( primary biliary cirrhosis , alcoholic liver disease , autoimmune hepatitis , chronic viral hepatitis ) . Subjects exclude history previous bile duct surgery , previous choledocholithiasis , recurrent ascend cholangitis , previous history variceal hemorrhage , cholangiocarcinoma . Subjects PSC stage III ( fibrosis ) IV ( cirrhosis ) base criterion Ludwig et al . exclude . Participants exclude pregnant . Subjects also exclude treatment corticosteroid , cyclosporine methotrexate occur within precede 3 month , anticipate need liver transplantation within 1 year . No fish oil supplement otherwise allow . Patients 5aminosalicylate preparation azathioprine remain preparation duration trial . Treatment ursodeoxycholic acid exclusion criterion . Patients therapy advise continue drug throughout trial . Those ursodeoxycholic acid allow start drug since could affect alkaline phosphatase level accept efficacious therapy . Subjects exclude refusal followup MRCP study completion . There exclusion base sex , race , ethnic background .</criteria>
