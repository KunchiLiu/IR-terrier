	<brief_summary>The Stanford Medical Center Division Immunology Rheumatology Division Blood Marrow Transplantation ( BMT ) enrol patient severe systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) resistant standard treatment ( prednisone cyclophosphamide [ Cytoxan ] ) new study determine successfully treat blood stem cell transplantation obtain appropriate donor . Donors human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) -matched healthy brother sister . For patient without sibling HLA-matches , search donor initiate US International Donor Registries . Eligible patient must least 18 year old SLE progressive kidney , lung , heart , central nervous system disease respond standard therapy . Patients treat two week prepare infusion blood stem cell obtain HLA-matched donor . Patients initially treat immunosuppressive drug , gradually withdraw approximately 6 month transplantation . The goal study replace abnormal immune cell SLE affect patient cause disease normal immune cell generate transplant blood stem cell healthy donor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Allogeneic Blood Stem Cell Transplantation Patients With Life-Threatening Systemic Lupus Erythematosus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate effectiveness allogeneic blood stem cell transplantation individual life-threatening SLE . A non-bone marrow ablative regimen consist total lymphoid irradiation ( TLI ) anti-thymocyte globulin ( ATG ) use condition recipient transplantation . Appropriately HLA-matched donor undergo `` mobilization '' peripheral blood mononuclear cell use G-CSF collection apheresis . The preparative regimen consist target low dose radiation lymphoid tissue administer 2-week period time . During first week irradiation , patient also receive ATG treatment . Patients admit in-patient service first 5 day transplant preparative regimen receive ATG infusion . Patients discharge second half preparative regimen follow out-patient clinic thereafter . Patients start immunosuppressive treatment cyclosporine mycophenolate mofetil prior infusion mobilize peripheral blood stem cell . The mycophenolate mofetil stop approximately 1 month post-transplantation cyclosporine taper begin 2 month post-transplantation discontinue 6 month presence stable blood chimerism absence graft-versus-host disease . In pre-transplant post-transplant setting , patient evaluate integrated team Rheumatology BMT physician . During first 21-28 day post-transplantation , evaluation perform daily every day basis . Patients clinically assess evaluated engraftment donor cell disease response . Patients follow need maximum time evaluation 1 2 week first 100 day , monthly 6 month every 6 month 12 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
