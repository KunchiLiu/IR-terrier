	<brief_summary>This study determine drug infliximab safe treat inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) patient chronic granulomatous disease ( CGD ) . IBD inflammation irritation gut lead symptom diarrhea , bloat stomach cramp . CGD inherited disease affect white blood cell call neutrophils patient susceptible repeat bacterial fungal infection . They also high incidence autoimmune disease , IBD . Infliximab approve treat Crohn 's disease , IBD similar see patient CGD . Patients 10 year age old CGD IBD may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history , physical examination , blood urine test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , tuberculosis skin test ( PPD skin test ) , stool test presence infection . Additional test may do , include colonoscopy ( procedure use flexible tube rectum examine line gut ) image study x-ray , chest CT scan ( test use special x-ray machine ) , MRI ( test use magnetic field radio wave ) , barium study ( study use drinkable solution barium help enhance x-ray picture gut ) . Participants divide patient IBD symptom ( Group 1 ) patient without IBD symptom ( Group 2 ) follow procedure : Group 1 Patients evaluate every 6 month medical history physical examination sign symptom IBD . Patients take moderate high dos steroid medication medication slowly lower ( taper ) evaluate every 3 month total 2 year . Patients group start develop IBD symptom move Group 2 treatment infliximab ( see ) . Group 2 Patients Group 2 receive infliximab infusion 2-week interval three dos . The drug give 2-hour period catheter place vein . Patients evaluate medical history , physical exam , blood test day dose . One week last dose , another evaluation , include colonoscopy . Patients respond well infliximab may continue receive drug every 2 month total 1 year , evaluation every dose visit . At end first year receive infliximab , patient follow-up evaluation every 6 month total 2 year . Group 3 Subjects volunteer undergo colonoscopy research biopsy serve control evaluation patient gut sample .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Infliximab Treat Crohn'S-like Inflammatory Bowel Disease Chronic Granulomatous Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic Granulomatous Disease ( CGD ) inherit immune disorder involve decrease phagocytic superoxide oxygen radical production , result increase susceptibility infection . Furthermore , predominance immune-related inflammatory problem subset CGD patient , inflammatory bowel disease ( CGD-IBD ) . CGD-IBD often complicate obstruction , stricture , fissure , fistula , extra-intestinal problem . In fact , clinically histologically indistinguishable Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) , another inflammatory bowel disease affect general population . Crohn 's disease ( CD ) prototypic T helper cell type 1 ( Th1 ) immune disease . Since CGD-IBD bear close resemblance CD , possible CGD-IBD also immune-based . Furthermore , mouse study also support primarily immune basis CGD-IBD . However , currently little data Crohn's-like CGD-IBD human patient . Treatment Crohn's-like CGD-IBD primarily oral topical corticosteroid . Antibiotics ineffective stool culture typically identify clear pathogen . Many patient Crohn's-like CGD-IBD disease remain steroid-dependent , thus new therapeutic regimen need . This Phase I/II study evaluate safety efficacy Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha Inhibitor ( Infliximab Adalimumab ) CGD patient symptomatic Crohn's-like IBD . Infliximab Adalimumab standard-of-care treatment moderate severe CD , extensive experience use agent well document term safety efficacy . Preliminary report ongoing study CD NIH encourage induce remission . We also evaluate change immunophenotype cytokine profile peripheral blood colonic lamina propria lymphocytes follow treatment . In addition , evaluate immunophenotype cytokine profile blood mucosal cell CGD patient , without IBD , determine CGD-specific cytokine profile . Specific cytokine profile observe different genetic immunodeficiency , despite similar IBD clinical manifestation . Documentation clinical status perform use Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ( CDAI ) . Potential effect genetic variation ( include CGD mutation type ) expression IBD patient CGD , responses treatment also assess . The long-term goal study establish well alternative treatment modality low risk profile CGD patient Crohn's-like IBD .</detailed_description>
