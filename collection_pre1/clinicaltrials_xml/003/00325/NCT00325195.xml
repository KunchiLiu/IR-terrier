	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study PEG-uricase Treatment Hyperuricemic Patients With Symptomatic Gout</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study demonstrate superiority response rate ( control uric acid level 6 mg/dL ) PEG-uricase treatment group compare placebo-control group . While reduction resolution tophus report set prolonged urate-lowering therapy , photographic additional anecdotal evidence Phase 2 PEG-uricase study resolution significant reduction tophi 3 month therapy . Therefore , assessment change tophi time conduct use digital photograph obtain standardized manner subject study . The effect clinical outcome , include quality life , health-related disability measure , gout flare number swell tender joint also compare treatment group control group . Subjects randomized one three treatment arm 2:2:1 ratio : 8 mg PEG-uricase every 2 week ; 8 mg PEG-uricase every 4 week ; placebo . All subject receive intravenous infusion ( PEG-uricase placebo ) every two week order maintain blind throughout study . Study duration approximately 26 week , include two week screen 24 week ( 6 month ) treatment .</detailed_description>
