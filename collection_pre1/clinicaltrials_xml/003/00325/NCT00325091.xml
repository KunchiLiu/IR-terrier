	<brief_summary>This study examine effect long-term practice repeat finger movement people focal hand dystonia , compare healthy volunteer . Patients dystonia muscle spasm cause abnormal posture try perform movement . In focal dystonia , one part body , hand , neck face , involve . Right-handed healthy volunteer patient focal hand dystonia right hand 18 year age old may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history neurological physical examination . Participants train daily 11 day ( exclude weekend ) NIH ask continue daily 15 minute practice 12-week period perform sequential finger movement task ( key press ) leave hand . They practice initially NIH home . At clinic visit , learn motor skill assess record performance 20 consecutive trial eight sequence ( total 160 key press ) task . To evaluate long-term motor learn sequential movement , participant ask different task test Day 2 , Week 4 Week 12 . Brain wave activity , brain excitability also measure day . In one task , see random series letter screen sequential finger movement ask say number time see specific letter . In another task , ask focus specific movement perform sequential finger movement . During visit , question evaluate development abnormal movement may suggestive early dystonia . All participant electroencephalogram ( EEG ) transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) Day 1 , Day 2 Week 4 Week 12 evaluate brain activity . For EEG , electrodes place subject 's scalp electrical activity brain record subject performs sequence finger movement . For TMS , wire coil hold subject 's scalp . A brief electrical current pass coil , create magnetic pulse stimulate brain . The effect TMS muscle detect small electrode tap skin subject 's arm leg .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : The overall goal proposal provide new insight long-term motor learn study patient focal hand dystonia ( FHD ) healthy control . Long-term motor learn never study FHD patient . Our central hypothesis dystonia cause abnormal long-term motor learning . Specifically , aim study : 1 . To show FHD patient abnormal motor learning , particular , slow motor skill acquisition compare healthy control . 2 . To show FHD patient difficulty perform newly acquire motor skill automatically . 3 . To study brain dynamic ( i.e . cortico-cortical connectivity motor cortex excitability ) FHD patient healthy control learn sequence finger movement 3-month period time . STUDY POPULATION : We follow 10 patient FHD affect dominant hand 10 healthy volunteer . DESIGN : We devise case-control experimental study evaluate long-term learn sequential finger movement FHD patient healthy control . We study FHD patient healthy volunteer 12 week learn 4 finger sequence eight key press leave hand use metronome mark rhythm . All subject right-handed age-matched . They ask practice sequence 8 key press daily 30 minute first week 15 minute remainder study . For first 3 week study , subject come Clinical Center ( CC ) 10 time regular interval base availability . They practice daily CC home period . They come CC every 2 week ( plus minus 3 day ) remainder study practice daily 15 minute . At visit , learn assess measure sequence error rate ( SER ) variability interval key press . All subject ask keep log daily practice 12 week . At visit patient carefully question evaluate development abnormal movement pattern suggestive early dystonia . OUTCOME MEASURES : The primary outcome study measure SER baseline , week 4 week 12 use 20 consecutive trial 8 sequence . We measure multiple secondary outcome : ( ) variability interval key press ; ( b ) automaticity movement evaluate dual task ; ( c ) constrain action evaluate think task ; ( ) transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) electroencephalography ( EEG ) study explore change brain physiology .</detailed_description>
