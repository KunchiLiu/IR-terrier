	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine safest dose topotecan give high dose stem cell transplant ; topotecan give melphalan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Melphalan Topotecan ( MT ) Followed Autologous Stem Cell Rescue Patients With Multiple Myeloma .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The stem cell transplant cell find bone marrow blood responsible make red blood cell , white blood cell , platelet . The stem cell collect process call leukapheresis frozen later use . After receive chemotherapy drug , stem cell thaw give like blood transfusion . This call autologous stem cell transplant rescue . The study doctor measure well disease responds drug well side effect drug . During course study , blood bone marrow sample obtain measure level chemotherapy drug well level certain enzyme ( protein ) . The staff Blood Marrow Transplant program continue collect information participant 's disease treatment rest life .</detailed_description>
