	<brief_summary>Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) affect 14 million people United States . It fourth lead cause death lead cause death mortality rate rise . Medical science develop effective therapy COPD . In patient advanced COPD chronic hypoxemia , long-term oxygen therapy ( LTOT ) show uniquely beneficial . It available non-surgical therapy demonstrate prolong survival patient . This study compare clinical physiologic benefit two different oxygen therapy device among hypoxemic individual COPD : lightweight ambulatory oxygen device versus standard portable E-cylinder device .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Benefits Lightweight Ambulatory Oxygen Systems Individuals With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals COPD experience hypoxemia ( reduction oxygen concentration arterial blood ) especially poor prognosis . Provision LTOT hypoxemic COPD patient consider standard care . The majority hypoxemic patient ambulatory supplied pressurize oxygen E-cylinders . This system weigh approximately 22 pound , mount wheeled cart , tow patient . These cumbersome system see impose significant burden weak debilitated patient , discourage active . E-cylinders tow cart refer 'portable ' , contrast lightweight 'ambulatory ' oxygen system , weigh less 10 pound design carry patient . It unknown whether patient provide lightweight ambulatory system comply good oxygen prescription increase daily level activity . This study compare use benefit lightweight ambulatory oxygen device versus standard portable E-cylinder device among hypoxemic individual COPD . Specifically , study examine daily duration oxygen therapy activity level amongst group .</detailed_description>
