	<brief_summary>There two phase study . The first examine serum copper zinc level copper/zinc ratio child ( age 3-8 ) autism compare level sex age child develop typically . The hypothesis significant difference copper/zinc ratio young child autism typically develop peer . The second phase study evaluate effect dietary supplementation use zinc vitamin C 16 week select symptom autism . Children autism enrol basis copper/zinc ratio great 2.0 , determine statistically high typically develop child . Measurements serum copper , zinc unbound copper obtain prior , mid-point end trial . Those child whose ratio fall 1.25 , top thecurrently recognize range zinc vitamin C dose adjust duration trial . Detailed evaluation language skill , variety behavior evaluate prior supplementation . The study placebo-controlled double blind . Those child enrol placebo arm offer full trial supplement end participation study . The hypothesis test whether correction elevate copper zinc ratio child autism accomplish oral supplementation zinc vitamin C child show measurable significant change receptive expressive language behavioral parameter associate autism .</brief_summary>
