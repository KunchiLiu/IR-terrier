	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety tolerability TroVax® investigational vaccine injection give first second line treatment conjunction subcutaneous low dose IL-2 patient locally advance metastatic clear cell papillary cell renal carcinoma . TroVax® experimental product trial value medicine yet prove . Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) standard treatment cancer , mean receive even one choose participate study . TroVax® study possible treatment patient cancer kidney . TroVax® belong class medicine call vaccine . A vaccine help body 's immune system recognize kill foreign invade organism effectively . It believe one reason cancer spread body immune system recognize cancer cell different normal tissue therefore kill cancer cell . A vaccine alert immune system presence cancer cell body could lead immune system able target kill cancer cell effectively . This trial completely new way try treat cancer future use vaccination injection . TroVax® consist virus change longer infectious carry gene protein call 5T4 . This protein carry many kidney cancer cell . When virus inject , make protein , body 's immune system able recognize protein kill cell ( i.e . cancer cell ) . The purpose study assess safety tolerability TroVax® injection understand whether TroVax® could make immune response happen patient renal cell cancer receive interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) . This study also observe monitor side effect experience patient receive TroVax® treat IL-2 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Safety Biological Activity TroVax® Vaccine Given Conjunction With IL-2 Treat Locally Advanced Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives Primary : - To assess safety tolerability TroVax® injection give first second line treatment conjunction subcutaneous low dose IL-2 patient locally advance metastatic clear cell papillary cell renal carcinoma . - To assess immune response induce treatment TroVax® subcutaneous low dose IL-2 . Secondary : - To assess tumour response rate , time progression , survival progression free survival 6 , 12 24 month commencement treatment subcutaneous low dose IL-2 . - To assess ability reintroduction low dose subcutaneous IL-2 induce disease response stabilisation patient treat TroVax® alone . Study design : This open label evaluation patient clear cell papillary cell renal carcinoma require immunotherapy locally advance metastatic disease . A single dose level TroVax® combination clinically accept regimen subcutaneous low dose IL-2 test 25 evaluable patient immunological response TroVax® ( antibody cellular ) assess . If immunological activity observe two cycle TroVax®/IL-2 70 % patient , randomise trial undertaken determine clinical efficacy TroVax® group patient . The dosage schedule subcutaneous low dose IL-2 initial dose schedule 250,000 U/kg/dose 5 day week 1 follow 125,000 U/kg/dose 5 day week 2 though 6 inclusive . There two-week recovery period next cycle commences . The dosage regimen TroVax® injection give prior first cycle two occasion ( week -2 1 ) , one injection give begin week 4 first cycle . In subsequent cycle , booster injection TroVax® give week 1 , prior commencement subcutaneous IL-2 therapy . After first second cycle combine treatment , patient evaluate CT scan response treatment . If disease progress second cycle , withdraw trial require alternative therapy ( deterioration one level Karnofsky score appearance disease new site ) . If experience progressive disease require alternative therapy stable disease well , treated cycle TroVax®/IL-2 describe four cycle . The tumour status evaluate CT scan every cycle . All patient monitor 6 cycle ( 48 week ) ass tolerability , induction humoural cellular immunity 5T4 cell surface antigen , immune response vector , tumour response rate , survival , time progression progression free survival . Patients intolerant treatment subcutaneous IL-2 part study withdrawn study . Patients still stable experience tumour response 48 week offer boost TroVax® without IL-2 every three month week 52 , 64 , 76 , 88 100 . During period , disease progression recurs , two cycle subcutaneous IL-2 described may give combination TroVax® describe objective induce disease response stabilisation . Following termination patient ' participation trial ( include progressive disease two cycle TroVax®/IL-2 ) , contact keep Investigators family order determine date death . A total 25 patient enrol .
