	<detailed_description>Radiation induce atherosclerosis Breast Cancer patient Radiation induce accelerate atherosclerosis well know entity occur different region , accord therapy deliver . This process take couple year develop . Therefore , affect population long term survivor potentially curative cancer Hodgkins lymphoma 1 , 2 , head neck cancer 3-6 , pelvic cancer ( prostate cancer cervical cancer ) 7 , breast cancer8-14 . The mechanism damage think direct endothelial damage , significant 6 month post XRT , follow inflammation , cholesterol plaque formation intimal thickening . This cascade , well pathological finding , similar see natively occur AS . However , post XRT setup , limit one part artery usually encompass entire circumference radiate segment15-17 . The accelerated atherosclerosis result radiation usually begin clinically evident several year radiation incident , sufficient functional reserve vessel . However , change see much sooner , study show significant change soon one year initial insult 2 , 18 . Literature report suggest high 77.5 % symptomatic carotid stenosis ( risky region common carotid internal carotid artery ) compare 21.6 % match control group ( consist newly diagnose patient similar risk factor ) 18 . A retrospective review Philadelphia 413 treat patient find RR stroke 2 , compare general population ( match risk factor ) Stockholm database5 . Data Netherlands suggest risk stroke high 5 time compare matched group without cancer . The analysis do patient receive treatment 60 yo ( comparison make general population patient usually smokers drinker usually high risk begin , however XRT increase already high risk 5 ) . A new emerge technique Carotid Intima-Media Thickening ( IMT ) demonstrate impact radiation ( 2.2 Vs 0.7mm control ) 6 . Our proposal aim well characterize side effect . For purpose , choose study woman receive radiation breast , part carotid irradiated side high energy radiation field . The contralateral artery , receive trace scatter radiation , serve internal control . This case head neck patient , usually receive high dose radiation side neck . The number early breast cancer patient receive adjuvant radiation relatively high , factor may help u reach accrual goal much faster . Subsequently plan proceed consecutive study try pharmacologically interfere progression AS , perhaps even prevent . Intima Media Thickening US non-invasive US technique available Hadassah University Medical Center perform study order detect degree AS affected non affect artery . The suggested study consist two population . Group 1 woman receive radiation breast cancer past various time interval Group 2 woman newly diagnose breast cancer . Markers biochemistry test might elucidate predispose contribute factor develop AS also do analyzed patient . The latter could target treatment surrogate treatment efficacy , side effect , cancer progression ( i.e . cholesterol level , hypertension , hypothyroidism , etc . )</detailed_description>
