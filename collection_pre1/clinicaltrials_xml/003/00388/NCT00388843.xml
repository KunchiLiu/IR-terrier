	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine short term ( 6 month ) treatment statin low low-density lipoprotein ( LDL ) vascular disease patient carotid plaque associate measurable reduction carotid plaque volume use 3 Tesla MRI . The researcher correlate change plaque volume degree LDL lowering . The researcher also study brief treatment lead change plaque composition . The researcher compare change plaque volume measure 3T MRI plaque burden measure ultrasound .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carotid Plaque Regression With Statin Treatment Assessed High Field Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Atherosclerotic vascular disease lead cause death United States . Atherosclerosis develop increase plaque burden eccentric arterial wall expansion remodeling , later lead luminal obstruction . More 90 % patient CAD carotid plaque . Statins show cause plaque regression carotid coronary artery . However , ongoing controversy low target LDL atherosclerotic patient . The benefit aggressive LDL lower high statin dos counterbalance potential liver muscle toxicity . High field ( 3 Tesla ) MRI promise new modality measure plaque volume high spatial resolution . It clear whether increase statin dose lead plaque volume reduction short-term ( 6 month ) measure new modality . The primary aim study determine LDL lower use statin vascular disease patient carotid plaque associate measurable reduction carotid plaque volume short term ( 6 month ) use 3T MRI . The four secondary aim study follow : To compare short term carotid plaque volume change use high field MRI vascular disease patient whose statin dose increase ( dose increase ) versus whose statin dose maintain ( dose maintain ) . To determine increase statin dose patient carotid plaque lead measurable change carotid plaque composition short term ( 6 month ) use 3T MRI . To compare carotid plaque volume change use 3T MRI change plaque burden score use carotid ultrasound . To determine relationship change plaque volume change lipid level ( total cholesterol , LDL , HDL ) change inflammatory marker ( cytokine , high sensitivity CRP ) . The study significant provide insight optimal statin treatment atherosclerotic disease . It also test new modality measurement plaque burden . A reliable sensitive test high spatial resolution accurately measure change plaque volume helpful assess response treatment tool future clinical trial assess efficacy new treatment modality may reduce need expensive , long term study rely clinical event outcome measurement .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Adult ( &gt; 21 year old ) patient . Diagnosed coronary artery disease suspect cerebrovascular accident . For dose increased subject , patient whose statin dose LDL lower therapy double increased standard dose high dose ( see table ) . For dose maintain subject , patient whose statin dose LDL lower therapy maintain standard dose ( see table ) . Standard Dose ( report LDL↓ &lt; 40 % literature ) Drug Daily Dose/s : ( md/day ) atorvastatin 10 simvastatin 5 , 10 , 20 pravastatin 10 , 20 , 40 , 80 fluvastatin 20 , 40 , 80 lovastatin 10 , 20 , 40 High Dose ( report LDL↓ &gt; 40 % literature ) Drug Daily Dose/s ( mg/day ) atorvastatin 40 , 80 simvastatin 40 , 80 lovastatin 80 rosuvastatin 5 , 10 , 20 , 40 Addition nonstatin lipid transfer ( tx ) ( e.g. , ezetimibe , fibrate , niacin ) standard statin dose Exclusion criterion : severe claustrophobia cause inability undergo MRI implant ferromagnetic material ( pacemaker , defibrillator , TENS unit , aneurysm clip , etc . ) suitable MRI clinical setting patient anticipate undergo carotid stenting surgery next 6 month patient unable lie flat 1 hour patient require supplemental oxygen pregnant woman patient could follow 6 month</criteria>
