	<brief_summary>This trial design prospective , multi-center , randomize , double blind clinical trial evaluate safety efficacy Thrombin VSI . An immunological sub-study ass antibody coagulation change subject follow exposure Vascular Solutions Diagnostic Duett Pro manufacture Thrombin VSI Thrombin JMI conduct component trial subset enrol study subject . Two hundred seventy ( 270 ) subject enrol trial . A minimum 50 % subject interventional subject 50 % diagnostic subject . All 270 subject provide blood specimen baseline 30 day follow-up visit evaluation immunologic sub-study . Within 270 subject enrol , minimum 45 subject treat Thrombin VSI minimum 45 subject treat Thrombin JMI provide blood specimen 60 day follow-up visit evaluate immunologic sub-study . The primary efficacy objective demonstrate device time-to-hemostasis study group treat seal device manufacture Thrombin VSI non-inferior study group treat seal device manufacture Thrombin JMI . The primary safety objective demonstrate device-related major complication rate study group treat seal device manufacture Thrombin VSI non-inferior device-related major complication rate observe study group treat seal device manufacture Thrombin JMI .</brief_summary>
