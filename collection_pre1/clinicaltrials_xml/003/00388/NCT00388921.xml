	<brief_summary>Vitamin A deficiency important health problem globally include Bangladesh . The problem great among under-five child , particularly malnourish . Vitamin A supplementation reduce morbidity diarrhoeal disease also prevent future diarrhoea episode . However , conflict report role vitamin A supplementation morbidity acute low respiratory infection ( ALRI ) include pneumonia . In non-malnourished child supplementation report associate increased incidence morbidity ALRI . The WHO committee [ 1 ] review risk benefit mega dose ( 200,000 IU ) vitamin A supplementation acute illness particularly diarrhoea , irrespective nutritional status under-5 child recommend vitamin A supplementation area vitamin A status low . In Bangladesh mega dose ( 200,000 IU ) vitamin A routinely supplement under-5 child every 6 month . Absorption vitamin A precursor GI tract reduce severely malnourished child , also lack retinol bind protein ( RBP ) , require transportation retinol target tissue . Thus establish significant portion supplement vitamin A excreted feces urine malnourish child . The excretion vitamin A increase substantially acute infection include diarrhoeal disease . On hand , due reduce RBP , concentration free vitamin A increase body result possibility adverse event include “ pseudotumor cerebri ” . It recently observe low-dose daily supplementation vitamin A malnourish child produce good effect recovery acute illness also prevent infectious disease among under-five child . However , limitation study include small sample size , delay assessment retinol supplementation among others . Thus WHO felt issue need address well-designed clinical trial . We hope propose study enable u compare efficacy low-dose daily administration vitamin A initial mega dose follow daily low dose vitamin A malnourish child present acute diarrhoeal disease without ALRI . If result study indicate daily low-dose similar efficacy currently recommend mega dose follow daily low-dose vitamin A , would important programmatic implication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High/Low Dose Vit A Diarrhea/ALRI Severe PEM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Globally An estimate 140–250 million under-five child deficient vitamin A , associate increased mortality morbidity among population . A relationship severity vitamin A deficiency childhood mortality also report . In 2002 , United Nations hold special session examine way eliminate problem various approach include breast-feeding , food fortification , improve diet supplementation . Periodic supplementation mega dose vitamin A recommend suitable intervention community level likely improve vitamin A status . This also cost effective patient compliant . This approach result reduction all-causes death among under-five child 23 % area vitamin A deficiency major public health problem [ 3 ] ( http : //www.who.int/vaccines/en/vitamina.shtml access 26 May , 2005 1300 hr ) . In view public health importance vitamin A nutriture , Government Bangladesh recommend administration 200,000 IU vitamin A every six month child age 12-59 month irrespective nutritional vitamin A status ( Institute Public Health Nutrition . Field guide National Vitamin A Plus Campaign , 2005 ) . Vitamin A required maintenance integrity epithelial cell growth differentiation , visual function , immune system [ 4 ] . Vitamin A deficiency lead patchy keratinization epithelial lining respiratory , genitourinary gastrointestinal tract [ 5 ] , act protective barrier infection . The loss intestinal epithelial integrity increase likelihood bacterial colonization incidence infection septicemia , also show vitamin A supplementation small high dos help repair damaged mucosa convalescence stage [ 6-10 ] . Vitamin A deficiency state worsen acute infection reduces dietary intake absorption , increase excretion vitamin A urine [ 11 ] . The mortality vitamin A deficiency also relate reduce immune function [ 12 ] , [ 13 ] . Vitamin A improves wound heal mediate early inflammatory response associate influx macrophage , enhance fibroblast differentiation , collagen accumulation [ 14 ] . About half absorbed vitamin A ingested oxidize excreted feces urine , remainder store liver retinol ester . It release plasma transportation peripheral tissue bind specific protein know retinol binding protein ( RBP ) . Protein deficiency severe malnutrition reduces hepatic synthesis RBP [ 15 ] , [ 16 ] likely reason low serum retinol level observe child [ 17-19 ] . Infectious disease diarrhoea acute low respiratory infection include pneumonia common malnourish child , worsen vitamin A level [ 20 ] . Acute infection also associate acute phase response transient decrease serum retinol level [ 21 ] . This due reduce transcription messenger RNA RBP , result decreased release RBP liver blood [ 22 ] , [ 23 ] . It likely liver utilize available resource rapid synthesis protein require host defense acute infection , thereby limit synthesis relatively lesser important one RBP . In severe infection , increase urinary loss retinol contribute low serum retinol concentration [ 24 ] . Thus utilization vitamin A peripheral tissue adversely affect systemic infection protein- energy malnutrition lead development feature vitamin A deficiency . Acute low respiratory infection ( ALRI ) include pneumonia , diarrhoeal disease two common illness affect under-five child . Earlier study observe beneficial role high dose vitamin A adjunct therapy treatment watery invasive diarrhoea [ 25 , 26 ] . It observe increase 1 mmol/liter retinol reduces proportion patient diarrhoea respiratory disease 50 % 80 % respectively [ 9 ] . A recent study observe supplementation vitamin A under-five child associate reduced frequency diarrhoea ALRI , subsequent malnutrition [ 27 ] . In another study 85 % infant attend diarrhoea treatment centre Bangladesh find deplete vitamin A store , measure relative dose response test , 61 % remain deficient despite receive high dose vitamin A [ 24 , 28 ] . Healthy child receive high dose vitamin A may experience high incidence adverse manifestation nausea , vomit high incidence diarrhoeal episode [ 29 ] , low dose vitamin A associate reduced incidence severe diarrhoea malnourish child [ 15 ] . In India study examine effect intermediate dose ( 8.7 mmol ; 2500 mgm ) , administered weekly , observe difference incidence , severity duration diarrhea vitamin A deficient child [ 30 ] . In another community base study , infant age 2-15 month receive 16700 IU vitamin A placebo weekly 8 week experience enhanced gut repair indicate improved lactulose-mannitol ( L : M ) ratio , compare hospitalized infant receive high dose . The result suggest impaired gut permeability convalescent period . There every possibility low vitamin A level infectious state low retinol concentration malnourish child aggravates already exist compromise gut mucosa thus necessitate vitamin A supplementation among hospitalize malnourished child [ 10 ] . There conflict report role high dose vitamin A supplementation management ALRI pneumonia malnourish child [ 31 ] , [ 15 ] . Even sub-clinical vitamin A deficiency non-malnourished child associate increase risk ARI [ 32 ] , [ 33 ] . Meta-analysis community-based study high dose vitamin A supplementation child age 6 month 5 year observe protective detrimental effect vitamin A supplementation pneumonia-specific mortality accord vitamin A pneumonia work group [ 34 ] . In fact , study report increase incidence ALRI child adequate nutritional status receive vitamin A supplementation [ 35 ] . In placebo-controlled study , high dose vitamin A supplementation neither influence recovery duration hospitalization Guatemalan child ALRI [ 31 ] . A high dose vitamin A evaluated study Brazil [ 36 ] , Vietnam [ 37 ] , Chile [ 38 ] Tanzania [ 39 ] , none observe beneficial effect , fact observe negative effect adequately nourished child [ 40 ] . Another clinical trial conduct Peru observe high dose vitamin A supplement ineffective improve recovery pneumonia hospitalize child , actually observe prolonged duration clinical sign , high requirement oxygen support , high nursing time patient care cost high-dose supplement group [ 41 ] . On hand , population base , control clinical trial Ecuadorian urban slum child , weekly supplementation low dose vitamin A ( 10,000 IU ) 40 week associate strong protective effect ALRI malnourish under-five child [ 42 ] . The report mortality morbidity diarrhoea pneumonia severely malnourish child association vitamin A supplementation conflict . In 21st IVACG meeting three paper review . They observe significant difference mortality ( 8 % vs. 8.4 % 8.8 % ) high low dose vitamin A placebo group [ 15 ] . Yet another study also fail show significant reduction ( 16.8 vs. 12.4 % ) mortality patient receive high low dose vitamin A [ 43 ] . However , sub-group analysis death significantly low among oedematous child receive low dose vitamin A admission [ 44 ] . A meta-analysis observe substantial reduction mortality association vitamin A supplementation population least low-level deficiency state prevalent , effect independent dose , sex age , effect pronounce incidence diarrhoea respiratory diseases [ 45 ] . However , difference morbidity ( frequency , duration , prevalence ) diarrhoeal respiratory disease note ( Ghana VAST Study Team ) [ 46 ] among stunted child Ghana . Malnourished child deficient RBP , facilitate excretion resultant free , unbound form vitamin A either urine face , situation aggravate acute infection . Vitamin A , administer single high dose , presumably circulate free form extra cellular fluid take liver . This free form vitamin A perhaps affect sodium water metabolism cause ‘ pseudotumor cerebri ’ , adverse event hypervitaminosis A [ 47 ] . Thus mega dose supplementation may yield good effect severely malnourish child . Rationale Vitamin A supplementation beneficial management clinical sub-clinical deficiency important micronutrient , observe improve outcome certain illness , particularly diarrhoeal disease prevent infectious disease . The beneficial effect vitamin A supplementation ALRI include pneumonia clear . WHO currently recommend single high dose vitamin A supplementation malnourish child diarrhoea low cost high participation rate improve health status child . The WHO recommendation base study community show benefit cheap intervention , quicker implement health programme . The programme vitamin A capsule distribution reduce risk vitamin A deficiency among participate child . Interpretation three study do Democratic Republic Congo Senegal , mention earlier , relation exist guideline vitamin A supplementation consider difficult validity doubt meeting convene WHO September 2004 . It , however , recognize question vitamin A dosage remain important one scope research . The meeting propose high dose give interval least 6 month last previous high dose . In Bangladesh , high potency ( 200,000 IU ) vitamin A routinely supplement under-five child every 6 month . There least three large study fail observe effect mega dose vitamin A incidence duration diarrhoea respiratory tract infection . In recent study show daily low-dose supplementation vitamin A malnourished under-five child produce similar well effect , compare high dose , acute illness also prevent infectious disease . Studies observe high mortality high dose vitamin A supplement group compare low dose group . However , do small number child [ 15 , 44 ] . In serum , vitamin A remains saturate RBP 1:1 ratio . Therefore , amount vitamin A excess ratio , would expect mega-dose supplementation vitamin A severely malnourish child low serum RBP , would non-functional best , least theoretically [ 19 ] . Two trial Asia use high dose vitamin A observed conflicting result . One study report , capsule distribution universal probably vitamin A deficient child would miss , response high dose unlikely due non-specific change . In study , vitamin A supplementation alone fail show expect improvement child survival demographic data deny importance vitamin A supplementation improve nutritional status [ 48 , 49 ] . On hand , weekly supplement 8,333 IU vitamin A report reduce mortality 54 % [ 50 ] . There thus need carefully design study adequate sample size address effect low dose vitamin A morbidity mortality among severely malnourish child diarrhoea pneumonia- basis propose study . We hope result study enable u compare cure rate low-dose daily administration vitamin A initial mega dose follow daily low dose vitamin A . Daily basal requirement ( estimate amount need prevent sign deficiency ) 0-1 2-6 year old child 600 650 IU respectively , normal requirement ( sufficient maintain desirable level tissue store ) age group 1200 1300 IU respectively [ 51 ] . It estimate malnourished child lose 0.1µmol retinol /day ( 97 IU ) urine acute illness [ 24 ] . The national coverage rate ( percentage target age child receive vitamin A capsule past six month , accord information provide mother ) vitamin A rural area 45 % 1982-83 [ 52 ] . The rate gradually decrease 37 % 1987-88 35 % 1989 respectively [ 53 ] , [ 54 ] . However , Nutritional Surveillance Project report December 1995 , coverage vitamin A capsule distribution increase substantially- 83.6 % rural 73.7 % urban area [ 54 ] . It noteworthy night blindness consider marker vitamin A deficiency , exceed 1 % , consider significant public health problem [ 55 ] . In Bangladesh , proportion child age 18-59 month night blindness rural area urban slum 0.23 % 0.12 % respectively [ 52 ] . These figure well cut-off public health significance vitamin A deficiency . Anecdotal observation doctor work ICDDR , B Hospital , Dhaka , indicate significant decrease number child clinical vitamin A deficiency seek treatment hospital . Further , accord report surveillance system Dhaka Hospital ICDDR , B 84 child present conjunctival xerosis three keratomalacia/corneal ulcer total 11,605 under-5 child attend hospital period 1996-2004 . Children enrol propose study receive 5000 IU vitamin A . That amount additional 1000 IU acute phase 800 IU nutritional rehabilitation phase severe malnutrition various diet provide hospital stay . We thus estimate total amount vitamin A receive source , even adjust urinary excretion retinol level , fall basal normal requirement . We feel able maintain daily optimal level vitamin A store body sudden development keratomalacia avert . However , remain vigilant , perform careful clinical examination ( eye skin ) , exclude child form clinical vitamin A deficiency enrollment . Children clinical vitamin A deficiency disease ( conjunctival xerosis , Bitot ’ spot , keratomalacia , dermatosis suggestive vitamin A deficiency ) eligible enrollment provide currently recommend treatment vitamin A supplementation routinely follow hospital . It may also noted couple study observe development overt sign vitamin A deficiency child receive vitamin A ( placebo group ) [ 15 , 41 ] . Additionally , serum retinol concentration significantly change 7 day hospitalization among child receive high dose child receive low dose placebo [ 15 ] . Clinical failure rate first 48 hour Dhaka hospital shigellosis , cholera pneumonia 31 % , 35 % 40 % respectively . Thus postulate clinical failure diarrhoea pneumonia reduce least 15 % current rate , vitamin A supplement low daily dose malnourished child attend Dhaka Hospital ICDDR , B</detailed_description>
