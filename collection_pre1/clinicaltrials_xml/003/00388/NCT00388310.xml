	<brief_title>Effective Antibiotic Treatment MRSA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Skin soft tissue infections—cellulitis , furuncle , carbuncle , abscesses—make approximately 1-2 % emergency room visit annually . While abscess generally incise drain , definite standard treatment regimen duration treatment practitioner adhere regard antibiotic use . Historical evidence suggest antibiotic may necessary simple superficial abscess , though number antibiotics—including penicillin cephalosporins—may use treatment large and/or complicate abscess . These antibiotic however ineffective become increasingly common pathogen— community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( CA-MRSA ) . At institution , estimate 60-70 % ( unpublished observation ) culture abscess cause CA-MRSA . These patient generally treat incision drainage , addition antibiotic leave practitioner 's discretion . Also , universally accepted duration treatment establish observe clinical improvement abscess . Common antibiotic regimen range 7-14 day treatment cellulitic infection . While one prospective trial regard use antibiotic simple abscess , publish prospective study use antibiotic treat CA-MRSA abscess adult . Furthermore , 7-14 day treatment seem recommend duration treat cellulitic infection , study evaluate duration treatment need observe clinical improvement abscess cause CA-MRSA . We wish prospectively evaluate duration treatment necessary observe clinical improvement abscess cause CA-MRSA among multiple different antibiotic ( ie . cephalexin , clindamycin , trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole ) standard incision drainage patient present emergency department .</detailed_description>
