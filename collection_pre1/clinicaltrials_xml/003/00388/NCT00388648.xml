	<brief_summary>There solid data real advantage early start dialysis , suggest DOQI guideline . Uremic patient frequently poor nutritional status . However , distinguish detrimental effect nutrition low residual renal function long period low protein-diet , per se . However , appear very-low-protein diet ( VLPD ) supplement essential amino acid keto-analogs amino acid , adequate quantity calorie , prevent hypoalbuminemia start dialysis slow progression chronic renal failure . EDTA USRDS data suggest patient start dialysis nowadays elderly , also high incidence morbidity mortality . Moreover , hospitalization rate become high start dialysis compare pre-dialysis period . Can aminoacid-supplemented VLPD , prolong beyond GFR limit suggest DOQI , offer elderly patient well survival good quality life dialysis ? The answer come prospective , randomized trial , elderly patient , start GFR value suggest NKF-DOQI start dialysis , compare outcome vegetarian VLPD supplement mixture keto-analogs amino acid essential amino acid , dialysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>An adequate dose dialysis need , order improve patient outcome , peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) extracorporeal dialysis ( HD ) . The debate , however , renew interest start dialysis . The NKF-DOQI group suggest use amount solute clearance regular dialysis value start dialysis treatment , i.e . creatinine clearance 9-14 ml/min . Elderly patient dialysis low survival rate.In fact , accord lombard Registry ( italian region ) , patient 70-75 year old survive 2.9/3.6 year ( male/female ) start dialysis , 75-80 year old 2.7/2.7 year , 80-85 year old 2.4/1.4 year . This low survival largely due combine effect age comorbidities , early start dialysis limit positive effect . Moreover , hemodialytic treatment might negative effect elderly : intermittent hemodynamic stress , continuous fluctuation electrolyte , metabolite , acid-base equilibrium , bioincompatibility membrane . In PD patient , negative effect also relate episode peritonitis daily loss protein high frequency malnutrition . An early start dialysis improve survival well-being , reduce morbidity . But rapid decline residual renal function ( RRF ) observe start dialysis . Maintenance RRF long possible important , kidneys thing dialysis membrane : tubular endocrine function , large clearance middle molecule , potentially toxic parathyroid hormone , granulocyte inhibitory protein , substance induce anorexia . In prospective study CAPD patient , every increase 1 ml/min GFR , relative risk ( RR ) death decrease 50 % . In CanUsa study , use time-dependent Cox multivariate analysis , 5 % reduction RR death observe 5L/week residual renal GFR baseline ( 7 ) . These result suggest , least elderly patient , fast decline GFR observe start dialysis could another cause low survival rate . In center , 42 elderly patient start very-low-protein diet ( VLPD : 0.3 g protein/kg body weight ) , supplemented mixture keto acid amino acid creatinine clearance reach value usually consider parameter start dialysis . The survival group patient compare 71 patient directly put onto dialysis creatinine clearance start VLPD . Subsequently , 24 patient diet group start dialysis mean GFR 3.9 ml/min , i.e . low 7 ml/min usually consider adequate PD patient much low 9-14 ml/min suggest NKF-DOQI group . In retrospective , non-randomized study , survival good patient treat diet patient dialysis . This seem bear RRF dialytic membrane must preserve long possible .</detailed_description>
