	<detailed_description>Multiple Myeloma neoplastic disorder last maturation stage B cell , call plasmatic cell . It represent second common haematological neoplasia , Non Hodgkin Lymphoma . The annual incidence 4 case per 100.000 . Multiple Myeloma invariably mortal disease . When illness advance , reduction infection resistance , intense bone destruction ( bone pain , pathological fracture hypercalcemia ) , anaemia , renal failure , less frequency , neurological complication hyperviscosity provoke severe morbidity mortality . Five-year survival rate patient Multiple Myeloma treat conventional chemotherapy 29 % . There urgent need new therapeutic agent treatment disease</detailed_description>
