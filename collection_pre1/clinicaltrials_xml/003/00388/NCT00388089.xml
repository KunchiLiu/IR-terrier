	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Bortezomib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , topotecan , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving bortezomib together topotecan may kill tumor cell . PURPOSE : This phase I trial study side effect best dose bortezomib topotecan treating patient advance solid tumor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Evaluate safety feasibility bortezomib topotecan hydrochloride patient advance solid tumor . Secondary - Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) bortezomib topotecan hydrochloride patient . - Determine , preliminarily , efficacy regimen patient . - Perform laboratory correlative study tumor tissue blood sample patient investigate potential predictor response . - Obtain fresh tumor tissue correlative study subset patient small cell lung cancer treat MTD . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive topotecan hydrochloride IV 30 minute follow bortezomib IV day 1 , 8 , 15 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable respond disease may continue receive bortezomib alone absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Cohorts 3-6 patient receive escalate dos topotecan hydrochloride bortezomib maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine . The MTD define dose precede 2 6 patient experience dose-limiting toxicity . Ten additional patient small cell lung cancer treat MTD . These patient undergo tumor biopsy baseline second course therapy . Tumor tissue collect baseline patient . Blood sample collect baseline , begin course 2 3 , completion study treatment . Samples examine topoisomerase-1 level western blotting ; BCL-2 , BCL-xL , BAX , p27 immunohistochemistry ; hypoxia-inducible factor-1 , plasminogen-activator inhibitor 1 , vascular endothelial growth factor , osteopontin immunoenzyme technique ; NF-kB p27 nuclear expression flow cytometry . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 34 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
