	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : Initiating chronic management treatment plan conjunction asthma educational intervention pediatric Emergency Department ( ED ) anti-inflammatory medication result improvement ED revisits ( unscheduled return visit ) . Chronic management intitiation conjunction asthma educational intervention pediatric ED anti-inflammatory medication also result improved Quality Life measure . Specific aim : 1 . To demonstrate initiation controller medication therapy conjunction asthma education result : 1 . Decreased return ED visit ( unscheduled primary care physician visit ) compare control group 12 month period 2 . Improved Quality Life measure Bukstein ’ ITG Quality Life measure . 2 . To describe relationship initiation controller medication therapy conjunction asthma education well child visit , miss school/daycare day behavioral capability . Objective : To determine impact begin chronic asthma medication regimens educational intervention ED pediatric patient 1-18 year age mild moderate persistent asthma . Long-term goal/purpose : To demonstrate success model care utilizes emergency department physician initiate National Asthma Education Prevention Program ( NAEPP ) guide chronic asthma therapy child 1-18 year age . This model attempt bridge gap initiation chronic asthma therapy currently leave failure emergency department primary care physician .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Initiation Chronic Asthma Care Regimens Pediatric Emergency Department</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study health outcome intervention trial utilizes randomize clinical trial ( non-placebo control ) two separate arm . The study conduct ED Texas Children 's Hospital , tertiary care facility evaluate 80,000 child per year . IRB approval obtain , guardian patient 1-18 year age consent enrollment . All child receive standardize burst steroid broncholdilators ( albuterol ) , however , patient randomize control intervention group . Randomization occur utilize assignment randomize number table . The randomization scheme package seal envelope conceal educational interventionist time enrollment . Once patient enrol , interventionist open seal envelope reveal assignment intervention control . The study utilize post hoc analysis age subgroup ( 1 5 year age 6 18 year age ) . Inclusion Criteria : The enrollee involve must child 1-18 year age , diagnosis persistent asthma reactive airway disease cardiovascular pulmonary disease currently NAEPP recommend chronic care regimen controller medication therapy . Exclusion Criteria : Patients without physician ’ confirm diagnosis asthma . Children concurrent cardiovascular pulmonary disease . Patients also exclude speak English Spanish primary language . Eligibility . Any child diagnosis asthma meeting inclusion criterion acute exacerbation asthma emergency department Texas Children ’ Hospital consider study . The patient 's family must use English Spanish first language . This study draw upon pediatric emergency department physician currently train Texas Emergency Department Asthma Surveillance project classification chronic severity . Any child identify mild moderate severe persistent chronic asthma eligible study long he/she NAEPP recommend chronic care regimen . Procedure . Once informed consent obtain , demographic information collect well information regard severity acute disease . As per standard ED asthma educational intervention protocol TEDAS intervention project , patient undergo asthma education utilize TEDAS ED asthma platform . This brief 20-30 minute personalize laptop-driven intervention deliver one train TEDAS interventionists . Patients enrol randomly enter either treatment control arm . Control vs intervention arm . All child ( control treatment arm ) give burst dose steroid ( 4 day prednisone , 1mg/kg/dose maximum 40 mg/dose give twice day ) discharge ED . All child 1-5 year age also receive standardized discharge medication instruction use albuterol nebulizer treatment : receive prescription 2.5mg albuterol 3cc Normal Saline aerosol use via compressor 3 time day chronic care regimen either treatment arm 1-5 year age control group already nebulization compressor . Children control group nebulization compressor give prescription albuterol MDI mask spacer instruction deliver 2 puff ( 90mcg per actuation ) 3 time day standard chronic care regimen . Instructions follow-up primary care physician 3-5 day ( standard care practice ) give discharge patient control treatment arm . Treatment arm patient 1-5 year age . Patients 1-5 year age randomly assign treatment arm give one month supply well prescription ( 6 month supply ) Pulmicort respules ( child mild persistent disease receive 0.25 mg bid whereas child moderate severe persistent disease receive 0.5 mg bid ) . Those child 1-5 year age nebulization compressor delivery system home provide one cost patient part study randomize intervention group . Upon one month follow-up call index ED visit , child improve symptom may reduce treatment regimen follow : child mild persistent disease decrease therapy 0.25 mg qd , child moderate persistent disease decrease therapy 0.5mg qd , child severe persistent disease continue 0.5mg bid dose Pulmicort respules . Children worsen symptom one month refer back primary care physician emergency department Texas Children ’ Hospital evaluation . Control vs intervention arm . Children 6-18 year age randomize control group give standardize steroid burst discharge ED outline . Additionally , receive standardize discharge medication instruction use albuterol nebulizer treatment : receive prescription 2.5mg albuterol 3cc Normal Saline aerosol use via compressor every 3 time day chronic care regimen already nebulization compressor . Children 6-18 year age randomize either control group treatment group nebulization compressor give prescription albuterol MDI spacer instruction deliver 2 puff ( 90mcg per actuation ) 3 time day standard chronic care regimen . Treatment arm patient 6-18 year age . Children randomize intervention group receive Pulmicort TBH ( 200mcg/puff ) instruction deliver 1 puff per twice day mild persistent disease 2 puff twice day moderate severe persistent disease . Instructions follow-up primary care physician 3-5 day ( standard care practice ) give discharge patient control treatment arm . Upon one month follow-up call index ED visit , child improve symptom may reduce treatment regimen follow : child mild persistent disease decrease therapy Pulmicort TBH ( 200mcg/puff ) 1 puff per day mild persistent disease 2 puff per day moderate persistent disease , remain 2 puff twice day severe persistent disease . Children worsen symptom one month refer back primary care physician emergency department Texas Children ’ Hospital evaluation . Follow-up . All child ( intervention control group ) receive follow-up call 14 day , 3 , 6 , 9 12 month . Queries primary secondary outcome make . Patients ’ family mail gift certificate local fast-food restaurant toy store token gratitude time follow-up call ( 5 $ per contact maximum $ 30 gift certificate ) . The regimen phone-follow outline PI ’ Educational Intervention Study ( Sockrider , et al . Delivering Tailored Asthma Family Education Pediatric Emergency Room Setting : A Pilot Study . Pediatrics , press ) . The one month re-evaluation ascertain drug use per recommend usage ( ie per FDA approve indication ) . Should drug change primary care physician , patient leave drug prescribe primary care physician . It important remember , note previous cover letter , trial test efficacy drug , intervention health outcome research evaluate effect start controller medication health care utilization assess asthma outcome . There need contact PCP one-month initital contact PCP include explanation decrease dose steroid acute excaerbation dose recommend NAEPP guideline first month unless patient experience acute exacerbation . If PCP change therapy , important outcome track relevant assure generalibility finding . Unlike drug efficacy trial , trial intend measure health outcome ED intervention STARTING chronic care . The additional measure one month follow-up assure drug deliver per initital ED discussion ( include stepdown ) per PCP recommendation . If PCP instructs parent change dose alter dose , take priority PCP change plan note impact analyze .</detailed_description>
