	<brief_title>Sunitinib Malate Treating Patients With Recurrent Ovarian Epithelial , Fallopian Tube , Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess efficacy ( response rate ) sunitinib ( sunitinib malate ) give orally daily patient advance metastatic previously treat epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal carcinoma . II . To assess toxicity sunitinib patient advance metastatic previously treat epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal carcinoma . III . To document cancer antigen 125 ( CA125 ) response rate , early objective progression rate , , objective response observe , response duration . OUTLINE : Patients receive sunitinib malate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
