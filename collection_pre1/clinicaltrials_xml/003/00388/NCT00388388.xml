	<brief_title>Losartan Versus Hydrochlorothiazide Reversing Remodeling Small Arteries Pre-Hypertensive Pre-Diabetic Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , parallel group , two-centre pilot study test hypothesis subject otherwise healthy fulfill criterion diagnosis pre-hypertension pre-diabetes regression reduce progression hypertension-associated change resistance artery blood pressure control 6 month losartan , whereas similar subject whose blood pressure equally well control use hydrochlorothiazide significantly less improvement change resistance artery . The study conduct Dr. Ernesto Schiffrin Cardiovascular Prevention Center , Sir Mortimer B. Davis Jewish General Hospital , McGill University , Montreal , association co-investigator second site , Dr. Rhian M. Touyz Ottawa General Hospital 's Hypertension Clinic Riverside Campus Kidney Research Center ( University Ottawa/Ottawa Health Research Institute ) . Over past 15 year , Dr. Schiffrin develop gluteal subcutaneous biopsy methodology apply study . The technique practice many year ( 15 year ) Dr. Schiffrin , recently collaborate Dr. Touyz use technique together Dr. Schiffrin move Ottawa 2005 . In addition , stiffness aorta ( carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity ) endothelium-dependent hyperemic response evaluate . Dr. Schiffrin Dr. Touyz responsible patient recruitment , data collection analysis , maintenance study chart patient record . Merck-Frosst Canada Ltd ( MFCL ) responsible study budget supply medication . The study subject ( men woman , 25 70 year age ) divide two group . Individuals pre-hypertension ( blood pressure = 120-139/85-90 mmHg ) double-blindly allocate either losartan hydrochlorothiazide therapy respectively group 1 2 . Study subject assess compatibility inclusion exclusion criterion , subject meet criterion undergo baseline biopsy gluteal subcutaneous resistance vessel . In addition , stiffness aorta ( carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity ) finger endothelium-dependent hyperemic response evaluate . Subjects treatment group receive antihypertensive therapy 6 month , control blood pressure 100-120/70-80 mmHg , repeat gluteal biopsy , aortic stiffness endothelial function measurement . The media/lumen ratio resistance artery 150-300 um lumen diameter biopsied tissue determine . Previous work ( 1-3 ) show parameter useful marker hypertensive vascular disease may modify treatment antihypertensive agent , particularly blocker renin-angiotensin system . Subjects give informed consent , medically assess determine whether satisfy inclusion exclusion criterion . Eligible subject sit systolic blood pressure ( SiSBP ) 120-139 mmHg , otherwise good health . Eligible subject gluteal biopsy , randomize treatment group 1 group 2 6 month . For study purpose , SiSBP define average three consecutive valid reading , take one-minute interval five minute repose . Thirty subject satisfy study criterion randomize receive daily therapy either losartan 50 mg hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg . Subjects take study medication daily 06:30 11:00 , follow morning clinic visit , schedule 06:30 11:00 . Subjects instructed take medication morning clinic visit clinic evaluation complete . During 6 month treatment , subject `` trough '' blood pressure , heart rate ( HR ) body weight measure every clinic visit . At visit laboratory safety test do , subject ask come fasting . All subject force-titrated losartan 100mg daily hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg daily . However , develop dizziness and/or SiBPs 100/70 mmHg , dose may down-titrated back 50 mg losartan 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide . If subject develop SiBPs &gt; 139/90 mmHg , open label amlodipine give maintain SiBP &lt; 139/90 mmHg , attempt however reach goal SiSBP &lt; 120 mmHg . Amlodipine start dose 2.5mg daily up-titrated every 4 week 5 mg daily 10 mg daily . As long SiBP &lt; 139/90 mmHg , subject discontinue study . Subjects whose hypertension adequately control ( SiBP &gt; 139/90 mmHg ) addition amlodipine up-titrated 10 mg daily , however , discontinue study . Laboratory safety test do Weeks 4 , 12 , 24 double-blind therapy ( Visits 6 , 8 9 ) . An ECG repeat end study ( Week 24 ) . The study start end 2006 , last approximately 1 year . Recruitment complete within 6-9 month . Duration period specify briefly within protocol .</detailed_description>
