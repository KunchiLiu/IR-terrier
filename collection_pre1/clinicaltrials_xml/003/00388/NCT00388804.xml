	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : - To assess possible improvement prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) outcome short course androgen suppression therapy conjunction dose-escalation intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) , 3D conformal radiation therapy ( 3D-CRT ) , proton therapy IMRT , 3D-CRT , proton therapy alone prostate cancer patient traditionally consider intermediate risk PSA failure follow conventional local therapy . PSA failure primary endpoint . Secondary Objectives : - To assess local control , freedom distant metastasis , overall survival . - To study impact radiation therapy and/or hormone therapy health-related quality life measure use Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-Short Form 12-American Urological Association Symptom Index ( EPIC-SF12-AUASI : http : //roadrunner.cancer.med.umich.edu/epic/ ) . - To assess prognostic value pretreatment serum testosterone well decrease hemoglobin neoadjuvant hormone therapy . - To assess prognostic value pretreatment biomarkers subsequent post-treatment clinical outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prior patient study show short-term hormone therapy ( 4 month ) radiation therapy benefit patient bulky tumor locally-advanced prostate tumor . These prior result use justify potential benefit use short-term hormone therapy combine radiation therapy patient less bulky less advanced prostate cancer . However , combination hormone therapy radiation show definitively benefit patient level prostate cancer . Furthermore , old study use relatively low dos radiation today 's standard , hormone therapy may benefit use high dos radiation . Researchers want study use combination hormone therapy radiation therapy treatment level prostate cancer . If eligible take part study , randomly assign ( toss coin ) one 2 treatment group . There equal chance assign either treatment group . If assign Group 1 , receive high-dose radiation treatment give 8 1/2 week . During period , receive 42 treatment , 5 day per week 2 day rest . There treatment weekend . This current standard schedule treatment prostate cancer patient . A radiation treatment planning session do actual radiation treatment . This planning session use get image prostate pelvic organ help plan radiation field . The planning session involve compute tomography ( CT ) scan take 40-45 minute . During time , 3 special , permanent tattoo mark place skin use ink . The tattoo mark help daily setup position radiation field . These mark small size freckle . If assign Group 2 , receive radiation therapy participant Group 1 , also receive hormone therapy bicalutamide ( Casodex ) either leuprolide ( Lupron ) goserelin ( Zoladex ) . The hormone therapy include total 2 injection shot ( leuprolide goserelin ) give every 3 month pill ( bicalutamide ) take per day first 21 30 day . Flutamide , take three time per day first 21-30 day , may use instead bicalutamide . The choice hormone therapy leave treat physician . You receive hormone therapy full 6 month . Hormonal treatment begin 2 month radiation therapy due start continue 2 month radiation therapy , last phase hormone treatment 2 month radiation therapy . No matter group assign , give questionnaire study health-related quality life . These questionnaire take 15 minute complete give therapy begin . Within 1-2 week start radiation therapy , answer health-related quality life questionnaire ( Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite-SF12-AUASI ) . Participants receive hormonal therapy also give questionnaire within one week hormonal therapy . During radiotherapy , examine every week , severe side effect reaction record use modify acute toxicity scale . During radiotherapy , also give EPIC-26 Short Form Weeks 4 8 . After finish radiation therapy , give EPIC-SF12-AUASI every 3 month first year , every 6 month next 2 year , year . This may do person , phone mail . Prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) testosterone level check therapy begin . These blood test require 1 teaspoon blood . They check radiation therapy begin , checked radiation treatment . Your PSA testosterone level rechecked 3 6 month interval radiation therapy do first 2 year . PSA check every 6 month Years 3 4 , year Year 5 . If worsening disease intolerable side effect , may elect remove prescribed treatment , may still follow part study . You ask return follow-up test form physical exam every 6 month first 2 year year . The purpose follow-up visit test check response cancer treatment . If PSA physical exam show disease go away completely come back , may repeat stag bone scan , pelvic CT magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , repeat prostate biopsy . You watch condition disease least 4-5 year follow-up visit PSA test . If willing return follow-up visit beyond 5 year , continue receive long term follow-up observe advised illness , accord individual need .</detailed_description>
