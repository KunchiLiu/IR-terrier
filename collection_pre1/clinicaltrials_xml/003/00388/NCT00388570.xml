	<brief_title>Study Monitoring Exhaled NO Symptomatic Asthmatic Adults Children During Anti-inflammatory Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma chronic inflammatory disorder airway . Chronically inflame airway hyperresponsive ; become obstruct airflow limited ( bronchoconstriction , mucus plug , increased inflammation ) airways expose various risk factor . Asthma cause recur episode wheeze , breathlessness , chest tightness , cough particularly night early morning . NO important endogenous regulatory molecule widely distribute throughout body . The detection NO exhale air first report 1991 , , soon show level NO exhale air elevate patient asthma . There much evidence show measurement concentration NO exhale air offer useful non−invasive method assess inflammatory airway disease . Exhaled NO increase bronchospasm unless coexist inflammation . Exhaled NO may valuable role differentiate inflammatory bronchospastic component clinical asthma , also useful guide therapeutic use steroid anti−inflammatory agent . A study asthmatic non−asthmatics subject show substantial equivalence exists stationary device NIOX® hand hold device NIOX MINO® compare NO measurement , similar condition consider examination make consistently possible . In study stationary device NIOX® , exhale NO measure two week inhale corticosteroid treatment unstable steroid−naïve adult paediatric asthmatic subject . The result 50.5 % mean reduction exhale NO . The change exhale NO also compare change standard asthma outcome measure , asthma symptom spirometry .</detailed_description>
