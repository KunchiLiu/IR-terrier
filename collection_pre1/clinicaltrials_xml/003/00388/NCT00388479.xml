	<detailed_description>Postoperative ileus ( POI ) temporary slow stop bowel function slow movement content intestine . This functional impairment persist variable duration follow surgery , usually resolve within 1 day small intestine , 1 3 day stomach 3 5 day colon . When POI persist 5 day , generally consider severe , sometimes refer complicate prolonged POI , increase risk related morbidity . No drug therapy show consistently shorten duration POI . This study design demonstrate alvimopan , novel , peripherally act mu opioid receptor antagonist , accelerate recovery GI function patient undergo bowel resection hysterectomy .</detailed_description>
