	<detailed_description>Medications improve function health-related quality life patient heart failure reduce morbidity , mortality , cost patient care . Due complicate medication regimen , however , old adult heart failure require assistance medication facilitate adherence improve health outcome . Recent study suggest outcome patient heart failure improve pharmacist provide patient education monitoring . This study aim develop test , randomize control trial , multileveled pharmacy-based program incorporate patient education material medication package target patient low health literacy . Elderly patient Wishard Health Services diagnosis heart failure ( n=314 ) randomly assign pharmacist intervention usual care group . Patients intervention group receive verbal write education , icon-based labeling medication container , therapeutic monitoring . A main objective pharmacist reinforce primary care provider ’ instruction patient . The pharmacist educate patient medication , identify barrier appropriate drug use , coach patient overcome drug use barrier , coordinate drug use patient primary care provider . Patients usual care ( control ) group receive intervention also serve prospective cohort identify determinant acute exacerbation . To measure medication compliance objectively , electronic monitor lid use heart failure medication patient intervention control group . These lid contain computer chip electronically imprint time/date stamp open closed . Each open-close event indicate patient take dose medication . By download information medication container lid computer , objectively assess pattern medication compliance . Study participation patient intervention group conclude nine month active intervention three month post-intervention follow-up . The usual care group permit identification cause clinical deterioration patient heart failure . The unique electronic medical record institution , Regenstrief Medical Record System , permit capture wealth clinical data , merge primary data trial ( example , medication adherence MEMS cap , brain natriuretic peptide , quality life assessment ) . Patients ’ data capture Regenstrief Medical Record System year follow-up use perform multivariate analysis determine cause clinical deterioration . So provided insight pathophysiology decompensation patient heart failure enhance understanding risk factor increasingly prevalent disease thereby lead u well therapeutic strategy . Covariates use analysis risk factor include age , sex , race , weight , ejection fraction , brain natriuretic peptide renal autacoid , New York Heart Association classification . Endpoints include health-related quality life , heart failure exacerbation , patient satisfaction , healthcare cost . We evaluate effectiveness pharmacy-based program improve adherence heart failure medication , improve health-related quality life , decrease heart failure exacerbation , increase patient satisfaction , decrease health care cost . Once identify , factor predict decompensation heart failure may become target future intervention aim preventable cause .</detailed_description>
