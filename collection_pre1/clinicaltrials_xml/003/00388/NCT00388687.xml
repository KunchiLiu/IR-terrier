	<brief_title>Hypoxia Imaging With 18F FAZA . Prognostic Impact Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Tumor hypoxia show prognostic factor local progression prognosis several type human cancer ( 1-4 ) , include cervical carcinoma ( 5 ) . Distribution oxygen within tumor diminish toward less vascularized center tumor ( 6 , 7 ) . Hypoxia important factor many pathological process , include tumor formation , associate resistance radiotherapy , malignant progression , metastasis . Although hypoxia toxic cancer normal cell , cancer cell undergo genetic adaptive change allow survive even proliferate within hypoxic environment . These process contribute malignant phenotype aggressive tumor behavior . Hypoxia negative effect anti cancer treatment ( 8 ) . Radiotherapy major treatment modality advance cervical carcinoma require free radical oxygen destroy target cell , cell hypoxic area find resistant radiation-induced cell death ( 9 ) . The gold standard measure hypoxia tumor invasive technique use computerized oxygen-sensitive electrode . This method cumbersome expensive become general clinical tool hypoxia measurement ( 10 , 11 ) . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) become interesting promising diagnostic modality hypoxia image tumor tissue . Several tracer develop purpose Fluoromisonidazole ( 18FMISO ) extensively hypoxia tracer study human animal ( 12-15 ) . Previous result image hypoxia use FMISO show regional distribution tumor hypoxia , express fractional hypoxic volume ( 16 ) . However , major disadvantage lie slow clearance kinetics high lipophilicity . 18Ffluoroazomycinarabinofuranoside ( 18FAZA ) recently synthesize introduce hypoxia tracer various tumor-bearing mouse use PET autoradiography promise result . ( 17 ) . 18FAZA show also superior biokinetics comparison 18F-MISO animal ( 18 ) . The safety feasibility FAZA evaluate recently 10 patient advance squamous cell carcinoma head neck . The author study conclude PET image FAZA appear safe feasible patient head neck tumor . ( 19 ) . Aim study The aim study visualize tumor hypoxic tissue , potential quantitative change biological behavior cervical carcinoma ( primary / lymph node ) , radiochemotherapy novel hypoxia PET tracer 18FAZA . Materials method Patients Twenty-five patient cervical carcinoma ( T2Nx TxN1 ) include present study . In addition routine pre-therapeutical stag cervical cancer , 18FAZA PET perform , plan radio/chemotherapy ( short brachytherapy ) 3 month therapy . Synthesis quality control 18FAZA ( Research Center Seibersdorf ) 18FMISO synthesize previously describe ( 20 ) . The synthesis 18F-FAZA perform follow ( 21 ) :5 mg precursor 1- ( 2,3-diacetyl-5-tosyl-a-D-arabinofuranosyl ) -2-nitroimidazole 1 mL dimethyl sulfoxide react mixture azeotropically dry 18F-fluoride , 15 mg Kryptofix 2.2.2 . ( Merck ) , 3.5 mg K2CO3 100C 5 min . After hydrolysis 1 mL 0.1 N NaOH ( 2 min,30C ) , 0.5 mL 0.4N NaH2PO4 add neutralization . The product purify first use alumina cartridge ( Alu N light ; Waters ) high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) ( Phenomenex Nucleosil C18 ; ethanol/NaH2PO4 buffer ( 5:95 ) ; flow , 4mL/min ; detection ultraviolet ( 320nm ) , Na ( Tl ) ) . The product obtain radiochemical yield 20.7 % +-3.5 % ( n=12 ) end beam . After irradiation 1 h 35ÂµA , 9.1 +-1.4GBq ( n=8 ) 18FFAZA isolate . [ 18F ] FAZA PET image Patients 18FFAZA image perform patient overnight fast dedicate full ring PET scanner ( Advance , General Electric Medical Systems , Milwaukee , WI ) . The patient scan subsequent administration activity ( dynamic scan ) 2 hour afterwards ( static scan ) . For image acquisition 10-min transmission scan perform . All image acquire 3D-mode matrix 128x128 . The dynamic scan ( pelvis ) begin intravenous administration 370 MBq 18FFAZA . Over first hour 21 frame acquire ( 6 frames 20 , 6 frame 30 , 2 frame 150s , 4 frame 300s , 3 frame 600s ) . Two hour application 10-min static scan ( pelvis + abdomen ) acquire . The image reconstruct use iterative algorithm ( OSEM ) . In addition visual interpretation acquire image semi quantitative analysis perform draw region interest ( ROIs ) tumor tissue ( primary lymphnodes ) . For ROIs standardize uptake value ( SUV ) ratios normal tissue ( muscle ) calculate . Blood sample Simultaneously FAZA PET scan blood sampling ( 10ml ) drawn measurement protein concentration ( VEGF , Osteopontin , PAI ) . In total , 30 ml blood collect patient . Radiation burden The estimate radiation burden 18FFAZA ( 370MBq ) examination amount 12 mSv ( equivalent CT examination thorax ) . Risks , Side effect , Toxicity The fluorine-18 ( 18F ) label compound obtain nucleophilic substitution tosylate-precursor no-carrier-added 18F-fluoride specific activity &gt; 74 MBq / nmol . The administration 370 MBq 18F-FAZA therefore correspond &lt; 5 nmol compound exert pharmacologic toxicologic effect . Similar radiopharmaceutical 18FMISO show side effect clinical use human ( 22 ) Including criterion patient First diagnosis histologically proven cervical cancer FIGO stage IB2 IVA . Treatment intention purpose achieve cure Age &lt; 80 year No previous standard radical hysterectomy Excluding criterion patient Pregnancy , breast-feeding woman , patient able lie motionless one hour . Palliative treatment , recurrent disease , neoadjuvant chemotherapy , pre-existing malignancy , age &gt; 80 year , Statistics ( SUVs ) Results give median ( range ) . The t-test use comparison group , p value &lt; 0.05 consider significant . `` Median SUV '' : stand median maximal SUVs particular region interest ( ROI ) .</detailed_description>
