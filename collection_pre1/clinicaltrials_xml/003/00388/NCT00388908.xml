	<brief_summary>Osteoporosis common progressive condition lead break bone ( fracture ) , cause pain , disability , deformity , even death . There new treatment available decrease risk fracture 50 % , people benefit osteoporosis already fracture , like vertebral ( spine ) fracture . Vertebral fracture usually `` silent , '' ~20 % people age 60 year one although n't know . Many people chest x-rays do reason , x-ray incidentally detect silent fracture . Although people vertebral fracture test treated osteoporosis , study demonstrate less one-quarter old people vertebral fracture ever investigate even treat . This reflect gap evidence-based best practice everyday practice community . The propose research address care-gap use quality improvement intervention use chest x-rays do Emergency Department remind family physician osteoporosis provide evidence-based treatment guideline - without educate empower patient osteoporosis . The effectiveness intervention compare usual care control trial . The intent research improve quality care patient high risk fracture , increase rate test treatment osteoporosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Addressing Vertebral Osteoporosis Incidentally Detected Prevent Future Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : To improve quality care elderly patient osteoporosis vertebral fracture incidentally detect chest radiograph Emergency Department . Background : Osteoporosis lead decrease bone mass , skeletal fragility , fracture . Osteoporosis affect least 1.4 million Canadians , 25 % woman 12 % men &gt; 60 year age . The common osteoporotic fracture vertebral ( spinal ) , two-thirds asymptomatic . Irrespective symptom , `` silent '' fracture cause disability , deformity , death . Compared normal bone fracture , patient osteoporosis vertebral fracture 20-fold increase risk future fracture . Guidelines recommend aggressive treatment rate re-fracture 20 % within 1 year treatment reduces risk 40-50 % . Guidelines , however , recommend population screen vertebral fracture . We report ( Arch Intern Med , 2005 ) chest radiograph perform Emergency Department detect `` incidental '' fracture 16 % elderly patient , although 25 % patient treated osteoporosis . The care gap evidence-based best practice usual care need urgently address . Hypothesis : The propose intervention improve rate diagnosis treatment osteoporosis high-risk patient . The intervention direct physician ( patient-specific reminder opinion leader generate 1-page guideline ) without patient-activation ( leaflets telephone-based counseling ) . Specific Aims : To determine whether exposure physician-directed quality improvement intervention can- Aim # 1 . Increase rate osteoporosis treatment patient newly recognize vertebral fracture ( ) ; Aim # 2 . Increase patient ' self-reported diagnosis osteoporosis relate knowledge ; Aim # 3 . Be augment addition patient-activation . Study Design : A single-center prospective nonrandomized control trial blind ( allocation-concealed ) ascertainment outcome compare propose physician-intervention usual care control . We define usual care notification patient ' physician chest radiograph result . Allocation basis alternate-week time series design , propose intervention `` '' patient one week , follow intervention `` '' ( i.e. , usual care ) next week . After 3 month , control offer physician-intervention plus patient-activation , outcomes recollect 3 month later . Eligible patient &gt; 60 year age present Emergency Department : ( 1 ) chest radiograph report presence vertebral fracture , ( 2 ) take prescription osteoporosis treatment , ( 3 ) discharge home . The primary outcome proportion patient start prescription osteoporosis treatment within 3 month fracture recognition ; secondary outcome include BMD test diagnosis osteoporosis . The intervention expect increase primary outcome least 20 % ( absolute ) usual care rate 10 % . With alpha=0.05 , beta=0.80 , 20 % losses-to-followup , additional power address secondary outcome effect patient-activation , require sample size 240 patient . Pilot Data Feasibility : Our pilot study ( AJR , 2004 ) find institutional true-positive reporting rate vertebral fracture 60 % , 100 % specificity , compare reference standard . A 1-year feasibility study random sample ~5000 radiograph undertaken ( Arch Intern Med , 2005 ) . Based data , expect enroll 3-4 patients/week , complete recruitment ~20 month , ascertain outcomes 30 month , finish study 3 year . The research team generate pilot data , systematically review pertinent literature , recruit opinion leader create guideline , train research staff , refine method outcomes ascertainment ; conduct related study wrist ( Annals Intern Med , 2004 ) hip fracture . Significance : To knowledge , study examine strategy improve care vulnerable high-risk population , believe result important regardless finding . If `` negative '' provide evidence costly laborious intervention need overcome clinical inertia ; positive , however , intervention widely applicable . In addition , positive result easily extend related population ( e.g. , routine chest radiograph do admission nurse home ) adapt implementation via modality ( e.g. , computerized decision support , telemedicine ) .</detailed_description>
