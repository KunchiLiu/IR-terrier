	<criteria>1 . Female patient histologically cytologically confirm carcinoma breast . Every effort make make paraffin embed tissue slide diagnostic biopsy surgical specimen available confirmation diagnosis . 2 . Patients locally recurrent metastatic disease receive least two ( five ) prior chemotherapeutic regimen breast cancer , least two administered treatment locally recurrent and/or metastatic disease . Prior therapy must document follow criterion prior entry onto study : Regimens must include anthracycline ( e.g. , doxorubicin , epirubicin ) taxane ( e.g. , paclitaxel , docetaxel ) combination order . Treatment agent require contraindicate certain patient . One two regimen may administer adjuvant and/or neoadjuvant therapy , least 2 must give relapse metastatic disease . Patients must prove refractory recent chemotherapy , document progression within six ( 6 ) month therapy . Patients Human Epidermal Growth Factor 2 ( HER2/neu ) positive tumor may additionally treat trastuzumab . Patients may additionally treat antihormonal therapy . 3 . Resolution chemotherapy radiationrelated toxicity Grade 1 severity low , except stable sensory neuropathy &lt; = Grade 2 alopecia . 4 . Age &gt; = 18 year . 5 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 0 2 . 6 . Life expectancy &gt; = 3 month . 7 . Adequate renal function evidence serum creatinine &lt; = 2.0 mg/dL calculate creatinine clearance &gt; = 40 mL/min per Cockcroft Gault formula . 8 . Adequate bone marrow function evidence absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; = 1.5 x 10^9/L , hemoglobin &gt; = 10.0 g/dL ( hemoglobin &lt; 10.0 g/dL acceptable correct growth factor transfusion ) , platelet count &gt; = 100 x 10^9/L . 9 . Adequate liver function evidence bilirubin &lt; = 1.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) alkaline phosphatase , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &lt; = 3 x ULN ( case liver metastasis &lt; = 5 x ULN ) , unless bone metastasis , case liver specific alkaline phosphatase must separate total use ass liver function instead total alkaline phosphatase . In case alkaline phosphatase &gt; 3 x ULN ( absence liver metastasis ) &gt; 5 x ULN ( presence liver metastasis ) AND patient know bone metastasis , liver specific alkaline phosphatase must separate total use ass liver function instead total alkaline phosphatase . 10 . Patients willing able comply study protocol duration study . 11 . Written inform consent prior studyspecific screening procedure understand patient may withdraw consent time without prejudice . EXCLUSION CRITERIA 1 . Patients receive follow treatment within specified period E7389 TPC treatment start : chemotherapy , radiation , trastuzumab hormonal therapy within three week . investigational drug within four week . 2 . Radiation therapy encompass &gt; 30 % marrow . 3 . Prior treatment mitomycin C nitrosourea . 4 . Pulmonary lymphangitic involvement result pulmonary dysfunction require active treatment , include use oxygen . 5 . Patients brain subdural metastasis eligible , unless complete local therapy discontinue use corticosteroid indication least 4 week start treatment study . Any sign ( e.g. , radiologic ) and/or symptom brain metastasis must stable least 4 week start study treatment ; radiographic stability determine compare contrastenhanced computed tomography magnetic resonance image brain scan perform screen prior scan perform least 4 week earlier . 6 . Patients meningeal carcinomatosis . 7 . Patients receive anticoagulant therapy warfarin related compound , line patency , change heparinbased therapy randomize E7389 eligible . If patient continue minidose warfarin , prothrombin time ( PT ) international normalize ratio ( INR ) must closely monitor . 8 .

Patients organ allograft require immunosuppression . 12 . Patients know positive HIV status . 13 . Patients prior malignancy , previous breast cancer , carcinoma situ cervix , nonmelanoma skin cancer , unless prior malignancy diagnose definitively treat &gt; = 5 year previously subsequent evidence recurrence . 14 . Patients preexist neuropathy &gt; Grade 2 . 15 . Patients hypersensitivity halichondrin B and/or halichondrin B chemical derivative . 16 . Patients participate prior E7389 clinical trial whether E7389 receive . 17 . Patients significant disease disorder , Investigator 's opinion , would exclude patient study .</criteria>
