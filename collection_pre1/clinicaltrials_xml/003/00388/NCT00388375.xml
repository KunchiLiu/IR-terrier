	<brief_title>Can Ultrasound Used Verify CVC Position Exclude Pneumothorax ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Central venous catheterization ( CVC ) subclavian internal jugular vein common procedure perform emergency department ( ED ) . This procedure follow complication 0.3 12 % case . Pneumothorax ( PTX ) catheter-tip misplacement occur . The diagnosis complication require chest radiograph ( CXR ) . In certain case , CXR may time-consuming , require 30 minute . This could harmful case critically ill patient . Moreover , several investigator question need routine post-procedural CXR absence clinical complication . Recent data show ultrasound accurately detect PTX critically ill patient . Furthermore , bedside ultrasound easy technique investigate subclavian internal jugular vein , improve success rate catheter insertion . Ultrasound also allow visualization central venous catheter vivo . Ultrasound report tool detect catheterization complication misplacement perform ICU physician , never study ED . This method could valuable hemodynamically unstable patient , quickly need CVC measurement central venous pressure , immediate fluid resuscitation , infusion vasoactive medication . Similarly , bedside ultrasound examination could quickly confirm PTX allow immediate chest tube insertion case respiratory distress catheter insertion . We hypothesize bedside ultrasound examination perform ED physician could accurately detect placement CVC presence absence PTX catheterization jugular subclavian vein .</detailed_description>
