	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Cisplatin Advanced Recurrent Endometrial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Gemcitabine cisplatin drug use treatment many type cancer . Each act kill cancer cell throughout body . Before treatment start , complete physical exam , pelvic exam , blood test ( 2-3 teaspoon ) , chest x-ray , CT scan MRI . Women able child must negative blood pregnancy test . On Day 1 Day 8 , receive gemcitabine chemotherapy small tube place vein 1 hour . This follow cisplatin chemotherapy give vein 1 hour . Before chemotherapy give , receive medication prevent nausea . You receive therapy Day 15 . One course therapy 3 week long . Routine blood test ( 1 teaspoon ) do weekly treatment course therapy ( every 3 week ) . A complete checkup , include history physical exam , pelvic exam , routine blood test ( 2-3 teaspoon ) also do course therapy month treatment end . CT MRI scan repeat every 2 3 cycle end treatment . Participants partial complete response ( tumor shrink 50 % disappear completely ) CT MRI repeat least 4 week later confirm response . You may continue receive treatment long disease remain stable improves . Participants experience significant side effect may allow drop low dose disease worse . If disease get bad intolerable side effect occur , take study . When take study , complete medical history physical exam perform . Routine blood test ( 2-3 teaspoon ) perform . Any side effect monitor go away . This investigational study . Both study drug FDA approve commercially available , though use together study investigational . Up 35 patient take part study . Patients enrol M.D . Anderson , St. Lukes Episcopal Hospital The Woman 's Hospital Texas .</detailed_description>
