	<brief_summary>The goal study evaluate proportion subject antiretroviral experience virologically suppress lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) 400/100mg twice daily maintain viral suppression switch lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) 800/200mg daily . The hypothesis study majority subject remain virologically suppress daily dose versus twice daily dose therefore quality life improve daily dose lopinavir/ritonavir ( LPV/r ) 800/200mg .</brief_summary>
