	<brief_summary>Urinary tract stone may form kidney along ureteric tract leave untreated , may result complication pain , bleeding , infection obstruction . ESWL ( extra-corporeal shock wave lithotripsy ) show effective safe method treatment kidney ureteric stone in-situ . In centre , ESWL do outpatient basis oral pain killer week follow treatment . Patients also instructed increase fluid intake period expedite clearance stone fragment . There study show pain caused stone due smooth muscle spasm along ureter , possibly mediate alpha-receptors . Alpha-blockers show improve expulsion stone also improve pain relief use alone , together ESWL treatment . In study , seek investigate alpha-blocker therapy ( Alfuzosin ) increase stone free rate improve pain control ESWL renal ureteric stone . The potential benefit include high rate stone clearance well pain control</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Urinary tract stone may form kidney along ureteric tract leave untreated , may result complication pain , bleeding , infection obstruction . ESWL ( extra-corporeal shock wave lithotripsy ) show effective safe method treatment kidney ureteric stone in-situ . In centre , ESWL do outpatient basis oral pain killer week follow treatment . Patients also instructed increase fluid intake period expedite clearance stone fragment . Alpha1-adrenergic blocker show improve stone free rate renal stone low ureteric stone . Tamsulosin agent commonly investigate . There study do study effectiveness Alfuzosin stone treatment . Alfuzosin show effective treat benign prostatic hypertrophy , good safety profile . Deliveliotis et al show alfuzosin improve symptom quality life patient double-J stent . This prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled study involve patient undergo ESWL renal ureteric stone . Exclusion criterion applies ( please see ) . The patient randomise 2 group : study VS control . Randomisation do use computer generate list block randomisation , assign consecutive patient either treatment arm . Our standard treatment intravenous pethidine 50mg intravenous maxolon 10mg onset ESWL session , follow oral analgesics- NSAIDs gastroprotective agent . For study , standardise oral naproxen 550mg BD oral omeprazole 20mg BD . The study group receive standard treatment , oral alfuzosin 10mg ON 1 month , control group receive placebo . Patients give diary chart pain score , use analgesic , episode pain , passage stone , side-effects medication complication treatment . At end one month , patient call back review . Stone free status ascertain X-ray , diary collect analysis .</detailed_description>
