	<brief_title>Prospective Study Infant Dengue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective natural history study define level maternally-acquired neutralizing antibody ( Ab ) correlate immunity may protect development dengue hemorrhagic fever infant . Approximately 10,000 mother-infant pair enrol achieve continuous study cohort approximately 4,000 child less 16 month age . Children leave study reach 16 month age replace new participant 6-14 week age . The investigator recruit study participant among 3rd trimester pregnant woman receive pre-natal care woman newborns receive post-natal care San Pablo City . The first aim study define level serotype-specific neutralizing Abs associate protective immunity symptomatic dengue virus ( DV ) . Neutralizing Ab titer blood sample collect Filipino infant DV infection , predict neutralize Ab titer time illness , correlate disease severity rank peak viremia level . Neutralizing Ab titer infant develop symptomatic dengue determine . The second aim delineate risk factor contribute pathogenesis dengue hemorrhagic fever ( DHF ) infant . From pre-illness blood sample , association Ab neutralizing capacity enhancement infection DHF measure control potential covariates . The covariates include measure represent viral load infant host immune response . The third aim strengthen capacity diagnosis research dengue Philippines . A collaborative international consortium form advance dengue research Philippines . The research generate vital data effective test dengue vaccine future public health vaccination campaign throughout region . This study enroll 10,000 healthy infant 6-14 week old mother San Pablo City . The infant follow age 16 month . Mothers infant enter study infant age 6-14 week . At 1st study visit , data mother birth collect blood sample collect mother infant . The infant blood drawn 3 study visit . The 2nd study visit take place infant age 4-6 month . At time , data infant health obtain . In infant , anticoagulated blood sample collect plasma PBMC isolation . At age 15-16 month , 250 infant per year select return 3rd study visit . The 250 infant randomly select without prior symptomatic dengue whose study visit 2 3 span significant portion peak DV transmission season ( June-October ) . Data infant health obtain anticoagulated blood sample plasma collect . Surveillance DV infection occur year round throughout entire period infant 's study participation ( age 6 weeks-16 month ) . Study personnel screen infant study present acute febrile illness . Those infant history clinical data abstract , acute illness blood sample ( serum ) take dengue diagnostic testing . A convalescent blood sample ( serum ) also take 10-14 day later . The primary outcome measure identification DV infection classification disease severity . The secondary outcome measure estimation peak viremia level .</detailed_description>
