	<brief_title>Lifetime Risk Cardiovascular Disease Among Non-White Ethnic Groups</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CVD affect million people United States . Current treatment guideline CVD take account individual 's risk develop disease within 10 year ; intensity therapy usually match 10-year risk magnitude . However , many individual low 10-year risk CVD , elevate lifetime risk develop disease . Unfortunately , study examine lifetime risk CVD , study almost exclusively performed Caucasian population . There study focus lifetime risk CVD among ethnic group . Because incidence CVD cause death vary among different ethnic group , important examine group separately . Using data ongoing clinical study , study evaluate lifetime risk CVD among different ethnic group . The result study assist estimate future incidence CVD among ethnic group , improve risk communication within patient care , identify new population individual risk CVD . This study use previously collect data 500,000 individual participate pre-specified clinical study . Some participate study include follow : Atherosclerosis Risk Communities , Framingham Heart , Honolulu Heart , Puerto Rico Heart Health , Coronary Artery Risk Development Young Adults ( CARDIA ) , Cardiovascular Health , Chicago Heart Association Detection Project Industry , Women 's Health Initiative Observational Studies , Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial ( MRFIT ) . There study visit specifically study . Researchers collect information CVD risk factor demographic , include sex , race , age ; compare information overall survival , CVD associate survival , lifetime risk CVD .</detailed_description>
