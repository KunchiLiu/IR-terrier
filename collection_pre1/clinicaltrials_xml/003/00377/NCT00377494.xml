	<detailed_description>The purpose study assess safety , tolerability , immunogenicity immunization 2 dos PfCSP DNA vaccine ( give 1 month apart ) follow single dose MVA.CSO ( give either 1 month 6 month later ) administer healthy , malaria semi-immune adult volunteer . This Phase 1 , randomize study conduct Tetteh Quarshie Memorial Hospital enroll 48 healthy volunteer , age 18 50 year . Twenty four volunteer initially recruit randomized Groups 1 2 . During Months 4 5 study , another 24 volunteer recruit randomized Groups 3 4 . Group 1 receive DNA malaria vaccine intramuscularly ( IM ) month 0 1 , MVA malaria vaccine intradermally ( ID ) month 7 . Group 2 receive rabies vaccine IM month 0 1 , normal saline injection ID month 7 . Group 3 receive DNA malaria vaccine IM month 5 6 , MVA malaria vaccine ID month 7 . Group 4 receive rabies vaccine IM month 5 6 , normal saline injection ID month 7 . Blood sample collect interval safety immunogenicity study . Vaccine safety monitor 10 month final dose . At conclusion study , volunteer randomize Groups 1 3 option receive rabies vaccine . The primary study objective : ( 1 ) ass safety tolerability immunization two dos PfCSP DNA follow one dose MVA.CSO healthy , malaria semi-immune adult volunteer give interval 0 , 1 , 2 month 0 , 1 , 7 month ; ( 2 ) evaluate whether PfCSP DNA/MVA.CSO prime/boost vaccine regimen induce PfCSP-specific immune response , assess IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay , background response ; ( 3 ) evaluate whether extend interval second dose PfCSP DNA MVA.CSO 1 month 6 month associate high level PfCSP specific T cell responses semi-immune adult . The secondary study objective evaluate whether extend interval second dose PfCSP DNA MVA.CSO 1 month 6 month associate high level humoral immunity ELISA IFAT semi-immune adult . The principal outcome measure incidence vaccine relate adverse event , abnormal lab value , local systemic reaction . An additional outcome variable remain primary objective result IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay 1 week administration MVA.CSO . This study plan first multiple clinical trial design test malaria vaccine adult , child , infant endemic region Ghana .</detailed_description>
