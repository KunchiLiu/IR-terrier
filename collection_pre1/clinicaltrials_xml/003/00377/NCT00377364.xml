	<detailed_description>SCIENTIFIC PROPOSAL Aims Primary 1 . Determine patient receive prescription corticosteroid therapy give acetaminophen small decline declarative memory receive placebo . 2 . Determine patient receive prescription corticosteroid therapy give acetaminophen small increase manic/hypomanic symptom receive placebo . Secondary 1 . Determine patient receive prescription corticosteroid therapy give acetaminophen small decline cognitive domain declarative memory work memory executive function receive placebo . 2 . Determine patient receive prescription corticosteroid therapy give acetaminophen small increase depressive symptom receive placebo . Background/Significance Impact stress corticosteroid hippocampus : Studies animals suggest stress-induced elevation endogenous corticosteroid administration exogenous corticosteroid associate cognitive deficit change hippocampal structure ( extended exposure ) include irreversible neuronal loss ( Brown et al . 1999 , 2004a ; McEwen 1997 , 2000 ) . These finding important implication common psychiatric illness include major depressive bipolar disorder frequently associate acute chronic elevation cortisol ( Brown et al . 1999 ) . In addition , year approximately 10 million Americans give prescription corticosteroid , prednisone dexamethasone , illnesses asthma , allergy , arthritis , dermatological condition ( Brown et al . 1999 ) . The hippocampus important mediates important cognitive process provide negative feedback hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis ( Jacobson &amp; Sapolsky 1991 ) . Thus , hippocampal impairment could result memory loss potentially even great cortisol level due loss normal negative feedback . This concept hippocampal dysfunction lead great elevation cortisol level additional hippocampal dysfunction term `` glucocorticoid cascade hypothesis '' ( Sapolsky et al . 1986 ) . Several line evidence suggest stress corticosteroid may impair human hippocampal structure functioning . Starkman et al . ( 1992 ) examine hippocampal volume use Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) 12 patient cortisol elevation 1-4 year duration secondary Cushing 's disease . In three patient , hippocampal volume fell outside 95 % confidence interval report literature . Atrophy correlate mean cortisol level . Our group recently report poor performance declarative memory task ( measure hippocampal function ) , small hippocampal volume low level N-acetyl aspartate , putative marker neuronal viability , group 17 asthma arthritis patient receive long-term prednisone therapy control group similar age , education level medical history receive prednisone ( Brown et al 2004b ) . Studies human also suggest small hippocampal volume Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) people chronic recurrent major depressive bipolar disorder ( Sheline et al . 1996 ; Bremner et al . 2000 ) . Although none study document elevated cortisol level time neuroimaging , mood disorder associate elevation cortisol . Therefore , one explanation finding hippocampal atrophy due excess cortisol point illness . Corticosteroids associate deficit cognitive functioning , may occur rapidly exposure long change hippocampal structure could detect available image technique . Thus , cognitive instrument may sensitive measure early change hippocampus due corticosteroid . Declarative memory , assess instrument word list paragraph recall , appear particularly sensitive hippocampal functioning ( Squire 1992 ) . Memory deficit report patient receive short ( day ) ( Naber et al . 1996 , Bender et al . 1988 , Newcomer et al . 1994 , 1999 ) long term ( week , month year ) ( Brown et al . 2004b , Keenan et al . 1996 ) exposures exogenous corticosteroid . Mood symptom prescription corticosteroid In addition cognitive effect , corticosteroid also associate change mood . Brief course prescription corticosteroid associate primarily manic hypomanic symptom ( Brown et al . 2002 ; Naber et al . 1996 ) although clinically significant depressive symptom report patient ( Naber et al . 1996 ) . Longer-term exposure lower dosage prednisone may associate strongly depressive symptom ( Brown et al . 2004b ; Keenan et al . 1996 ) . We find lifetime prednisone-induced mood disorder 60 % patient receive chronic prednisone therapy ( Bolanos et al . 2004 ) . Interventions prevent reverse hippocampal change secondary stress corticosteroid In animal model , pharmacological intervention focus agent directly reduce corticosteroid level reduce corticosteroid-induced elevation serotonin glutamate explore . A novel antidepressant currently available U.S. use human , tianeptine , appear prevent reverse morphological change rat hippocampus stress paradigm ( Conrad et al . 1996 ; Watanabe et al . 1992 ; Magarinos et al . 1999 ) . An additional agent , appear prevent stress-induced hippocampal damage rat , glutamate-release inhibitor phenytoin ( Watanabe et al . 1992 ; Magarinos et al . 1999 ) . If excess corticosteroid associate memory impairment eventual hippocampal volume loss , intervention may prevent reverse change great importance . Memory deficit secondary brief ( day week ) exposure corticosteroid clearly reversible medication discontinuation . Even hippocampal change long term corticosteroid exposure may reversible . Starkman et al ( 1999 ) report significant increase hippocampal volume , measure MRI , improvement declarative memory 22 patient Cushing 's disease approximately 3-18 month ( mean 12 month ) follow successful treatment normalization cortisol level . We report use lamotrigine , glutamate release inhibitor , 12 week group 10 patient receive long-term prednisone therapy ( Brown et al 2003 ) . We find statistically significant improvement declarative memory , suggestive neuroprotective effect hippocampus , follow lamotrigine therapy . We recently complete randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial phenytoin patient receive prednisone therapy ( Brown et al 2005 ) . Phenytoin associate significantly small increase hypomanic symptom severity placebo prednisone exposure . However , appear phenytoin , unexpectedly , may also associate negative effect cognition . Thus , medication cognitive effect may better choice use model system . Interventions prevent reverse mood effect prescription corticosteroid Only two control clinical trial conduct patient psychiatric symptom secondary corticosteroid . Falk et al . ( 1979 ) report lithium pretreatment might attenuate corticosteroid-induced mood symptom . While 14 % patient receive corticotropin therapy suffer mood symptom , none patient receive corticotropin follow lithium pretreatment mood disturbance . As discussed , give group adult asthma patient either phenytoin placebo time begin course oral prednisone therapy . The group receive phenytoin significantly small increase manic symptom severity group receive placebo ( Brown et al . 2005 , see also preliminary study section ) . Case report small open-label study suggest lithium mood stabilizer include lamotrigine , carbamazepine , gabapentin , valproic acid , traditional neuroleptic ( Ahmad Rasul , 1999 ) new atypical agent ( Brown et al . 2004c ) may effectively treat prevent corticosteroid-induced mood symptom development ( Brown , 2003 , Brown et al . 2003 ) . Our group develop research program use human receive prescription corticosteroid anti-inflammatory immunosuppressant therapy explore effect stress hormone hippocampus . Our current focus intervention may prevent reverse effect stress corticosteroid hippocampus . Acetaminophen neuroprotective agent Data suggest acetaminophen widely distributed central nervous system ( Caurad et al . 2001a ) may neuroprotective property . Pertinent propose study acetaminophen protect dopaminergic neuron glutamate excitotoxicity vitro ( Casper et al . 2000 ) protect hippocampal neuron oxidative stress ( Bisaglia et al 2002 ) . Acetaminophen also reduce staphylococcal enterotoxin-induced increase glutamate release rabbit brain ( Huang et al 2004 ) . Acetaminophen also alter monoamine rat brain ( Courad et al . 2001b ) , synaptic plasticity hippocampus presynaptic serotonin receptor ( Chen Bazan , 2003 ) . No report find effect acetaminophen mood memory . Summary A reliable early effect ( begin 1-2 day therapy ) corticosteroid human hippocampus decline performance declarative memory task ( e.g . word list ) . Preclinical data suggest acetaminophen may neuroprotective property . We propose give patient schedule receive prescription corticosteroid either acetaminophen placebo along corticosteroid . Our aim determine acetaminophen attenuate decline declarative memory , development hypomanic symptomatology ( e.g . insomnia , irritability , agitation ) good placebo . If pilot study show promising result would anticipate conducting large , definitive study , fund National Institutes Health ( NIH ) .</detailed_description>
