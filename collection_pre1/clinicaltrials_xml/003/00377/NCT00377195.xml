	<brief_summary>This prospective study test follow hypothesis patient stage I-II low grade marginal zone ( MZ ) lymphoma : - Involved Field Radiotherapy produce complete response rate &gt; 90 % - Radiotherapy associate locoregional progression &lt; 20 % 10 year - Death MZ lymphoma occur &lt; 40 % patient within 10 year radiotherapy This study secondary objective : - To collect information prevalence H. pylori non-gastric MALT lymphoma - To estimate rate acute late toxicity radiotherapy</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aims study : - To conduct first multicentre prospective trial radiotherapy ( RT ) stage I-II Marginal Zone Lymphoma ( MZL ) - To prospectively identify causal factor MZL , include infection inflammatory disease This study first large trial form therapy stage I-II , non-gastric marginal zone lymphoma . There enormous deficit literature respect fascinate relatively recently-recognised entity . MZL commonly associate underlying inflammatory infective disorder clear , least case infection organisms call Helicobacter pylorus Chlamydia psitacci , inflammatory condition actually cause lymphoma . The role H. pylori infection well study non gastric MZL large prospective study , despite anecdotal report regression non gastric MZL H. pylorus eradication . There report response doxycycline ( antibacterial ) therapy patient evidence chlamydial infection ( C. psitacci ) MZL tissue around eye . This association well study large prospective study long-term data doxycycline therapy exist . Management stage I-II MZL variable often ad-hoc Australia , despite significant retrospective evidence support radiotherapy ( RT ) curative treatment modality choice . In TROG/ALLG joint study , 100 patient recruit 5 year . All patient undergo breath test endoscopy detect H. pylorus infection . Ocular MZL specimens send Italy test C. psitacci . Patients receive highly standardise treatment RT . This study definitively document efficacy safety RT stage I II non-gastric MZL include patient stage IV disease limit paired-organs , disease show tendency home exclusively particular organ , salivary gland .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients least 18 year old histologically document nongastric marginal zone lymphoma . Disease limit stage I II adequate staging ( see Appendix II ) , patient stage IV extranodal disease confine paired organ ( e.g . salivary gland ) include local extension disease adjacent tissue . Patients involved lymph node side diaphragm addition pair organ involvement also eligible , provide involve tumour site , nodal extranodal , irradiate 30 Gy within tolerance relevant normal tissue . If pair organ involvement regard single extranodal site ( rather 2 separate site hence stage IV ) , eligible patient would regard stage IE IIE disease . Patients wide dissemination ( bone marrow , liver etc ) ineligible .
