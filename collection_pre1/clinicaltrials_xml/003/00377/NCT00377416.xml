	<brief_title>Experimental Gene Transfer Procedure Treat Alpha 1-Antitrypsin Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AAT deficiency genetic disorder individual inadequate level AAT protein . AAT protect lung white blood cell enzymes damage air sac within lung , potentially leading emphysema . Experimental gene transfer procedure , normal copy gene insert cell , develop treat many genetic disease , include AAT deficiency . In study , modify virus , adeno-associated virus ( AAV ) , genetically engineer contain normal copy AAT gene . When AAV combine AAT gene , result agent , rAAV2-CB-hAAT , able carry normal copy AAT gene muscle cell produce additional AAT . The purpose study evaluate safety inject rAAV2-CB-hAAT individual AAT deficiency . This 13-month study enroll individual AAT deficiency . Participants currently use AAT protein replacement discontinue use 15 week study . Participants first attend baseline study visit , include medical history review ; physical examination ; electrocardiogram ( ECG ) record heart activity ; blood , urine , semen collection ; pulmonary function test ; chest arm scan . Participants attend 5-day inpatient visit , receive series injection consist one four different dos rAAV2-CB-hAAT . Physical examination occur 5 inpatient day ; pulmonary function testing , arm circumference measurement , collection blood , urine , semen occur select day inpatient stay . Follow-up study visit , possible overnight stay , occur Days 14 90 . On Days 30 , 45 , 60 , 75 , 180 , 270 , 365 , participant blood draw local clinic . On day , study staff contact participant telephone review medical history symptom . Unused blood semen sample frozen store future research purpose . Participants yearly follow-up evaluation either telephone mail total 15 year .</detailed_description>
