	<brief_title>Active Immunization Patients With Carcinoma Oral Cavity Oropharynx With Autologous Dendritic Cells Transfected With DNA From Autologous Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This uncontrolled , non-randomized trial evaluate safety , immunogenicity feasibility new vaccine , consist autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cell ( DC ) transfected autologous tumor-derived DNA . Briefly , plan use two-stage trial design initially enroll 17 patient primary advance carcinoma oral cavity oropharynx period 2 year . The patient undergo surgery , portion primary tumor specimen necessary pathologic diagnosis obtain serve source tumor DNA . Each DC-based vaccine contain DNA-transfected DC . It administer intranodally ultrasound guidance . Only patient normal delayed type hypersensitivity ( DTH ) responses recall antigen eligible receive vaccine . Immunologic response vaccine evaluate . If evidence toxicity , &gt; 3 patient show immunologic response , second stage study open accrual 22 patient . All patient monitor interferon- gamma ( IFN- ) secretion enzyme-linked immunospot ( ELISPOT ) assay prior vaccination frequency T-cells responsive autologous tumor vaccine . The patient also evaluate vaccination capability T cell respond activate signal deliver via T cell receptor ( TcR ) . Primary Objective : To determine safety feasibility immunization patient carcinoma oral cavity oropharynx autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cell ( DC ) transfected DNA obtain patient 's cancer cell . Secondary Objective : To evaluate ability DNA-based DC vaccine induce immune response vaccine well autologous tumor .</detailed_description>
