	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn relationship serious mental illness detection management diabetes pre-diabetic condition . Patients diagnose schizophrenia increase risk develop diabetes pre-diabetic condition impair glucose tolerance impair fast glucose . In addition , novel antipsychotic also link impaired glucose metabolism increase incidence diabetes . The medical management patient may difficult ot achieve standard family practice . The objective project : screen sample high-risk population use Oral Glucose Tolerance Test ( OGTT ) , provide multidisciplinary team support identify diabetes pre-diabetic condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Many study suggest extensive psychiatric need patient could take attention away management health problem usual health promotion service physician provide . Studies suggest medical comorbidity often recognize diagnose psychiatric patient , especially among schizophrenia . Unrecognized physical disease often associate serious , potentially fatal illness , may exacerbate symptom psychiatric illness . The disorder schizophrenia repeatedly associate high normal incidence medical illnesses- specifically , diabetes mellitus ( DM ) . The prevalence DM retrospective study 95 chronic schizophrenic patient find 15.8 % - 4 5 time higher report epidemiological survey general population . This increase risk recently formally recognize Canadian diabetes practice guideline . In addition , first line treatment schizophrenia per many publish clinical practice algorithm , novel antipsychotic ( NAP ) , associate independently increase risk diabetes . Novel antipsychotic clozapine , olanzapine , quetiapine , risperidone demonstrate efficacy treatment schizophrenia generally few extrapyramidal side effect high dose typical neuroleptic . However , accumulate data suggest treatment least NAPs may associate development DM associate risk factor . The use olanzapine , example , associate weight gain , exacerbation previously well-controlled diabetes , onset type 1 type 2 diabetes . Clozapine also associate weight gain several report , well increase risk develop diabetes , least one report cite death diabetic ketoacidosis long-term use . High-risk group need target diabetes strategy . The Canadian diabetes practice guideline outline service model need achieve benchmarks set diabetes care need design reflect unique diabetes relate challenge face various segment diabetes epidemic . Diabetes care organize around multidisciplinary diabetes healthcare ( DHC ) team establish sustain communication network person DM necessary healthcare community system . The high risk mental health community Ontario need target primary health care service delivery model attend unique set diabetes related challenge face , include : weight increase relate medication use , inadequate self-care resource capacity relate poverty , social constraint lack support , communication barrier mental health symptomology impact interaction service provider . Current guideline diabetes management clear regard monitoring treatment identify high-risk group . Screening DM perform every three year individual 40 year age . However , frequent and/or earlier test 75-g Oral Glucose Tolerance Test ( OGTT ) consider people identify risk factor schizophrenia NAP use . Annual screening could detect individual undiagnosed DM well individual pre-diabetic condition Impaired Fasting Glucose Impaired Glucose Tolerance . Results large , well-designed study assess early intervention adult prevent progression pre-diabetic condition DM recently publish . These study demonstrate significant risk reduction lifestyle management appropriate pharmacologic intervention . It also well documented comprehensive multidisciplinary Diabetes Healthcare team help slow progression disease reduce incidence DM-related complication already diagnose DM . The London Intercommunity Health Centre ( LIHC ) recently pilot diabetes program address need high-risk mental health population within recommend guideline . The program design “ one stop shop ” self-management teaching , medication glucose monitoring , referral specialist provider need . The structure program follow Canadian Diabetes Association Clinical Practice Guidelines . Although program yet implement long enough determine progression pre-diabetes diabetes prevent , pre-diabetic patient involve program demonstrate clinically significant improvement lipid profile blood pressure measurement . Those patient diagnose DM , participate program , find attend regularly , demonstrate clinically significant improvement metabolic control . Thus , initial result LIHC , recent extension model community population , indicate model diabetes care high-risk mental health population promise diabetes risk disease management .</detailed_description>
