	<detailed_description>Bromocriptine mesylate , ergot derivative , sympatholytic dopamine D2 receptor agonist exert inhibitory effect serotonin turnover central nervous system . It propose bromocriptine reverse many metabolic alteration associate insulin resistance obesity reset central ( hypothalamic ) circadian organization monoamine neuronal activity . While Cycloset demonstrate efficacy reduce HbA1c , fast post-prandial glucose fast post-prandial triglyceride , relatively small number individual treat type 2 diabetes control Phase III clinical trial Cycloset allow full evaluation safety profile . Since person diabetes already high risk cardiovascular disease , important examine fully spectrum potential adverse positive effect Cycloset large sample person diabetes . Accordingly , present study design investigate clinical safety treatment Cycloset broad population person type 2 diabetes . To determine subject type 2 diabetes mellitus receive Usual Diabetes Therapy ( UDT ) consist either diet , oral hypoglycemic agent ( OHA ) ( 2 ) , insulin ( without 1 OHA ) plus either Placebo Cycloset : 1 . Whether add-on therapy Cycloset result all-cause rate serious adverse event , high add-on therapy Placebo . 2 . Whether add-on therapy Cycloset result disease-specific rate serious cardiovascular adverse event , high add-on therapy Placebo . While primary purpose study establish safety profile Cycloset type 2 diabetes , potential positive cardiovascular benefit evaluate well . Other clinical measure : 3 . The impact ( either positive negative ) Cycloset HbA1c , fast plasma glucose , weight , triglyceride lipid , blood pressure patient tolerability 12 month therapy . Furthermore , Hba1c change baseline 24 week Cycloset Placebo among subject baseline Hba1c &gt; = 7.5 % among follow subgroup : A . Treated baseline Oral hypoglycemic agent ( OHA ) include injectable insulin secretagogues B. Metformin plus minus one OHA injectable insulin secretagogue C. Sulphonylurea plus minus one OHA injectable insulin secretagogue D. Treated baseline Metformin one sulphonylurea</detailed_description>
