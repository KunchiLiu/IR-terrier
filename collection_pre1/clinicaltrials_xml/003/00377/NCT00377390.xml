	<detailed_description>Immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) important development allergic response may determine asthma severity . Omalizumab man-made monoclonal antibody directly block cause allergic reaction . There three main objective study . The first gain understanding omalizumab affect cell involve immune response . The second objective determine whether response omalizumab influence exposure environmental factor , include allergen viral infection . The third objective determine clinical marker use determine patient would benefit omalizumab therapy . This study evaluate immune allergic response inner-city child moderate severe asthma receive omalizumab placebo part parallel study ( Inner-City Anti-IgE Therapy Asthma , ICAC-08 , NCT00377572 ) . Nasal secretion collect participant begin study , toward middle study , asthma exacerbation require clinical visit . Some participant participate either basophil T-cell study associate procedure . These study require blood collection five study visit . Sputum collection occur four study visit . Those participant involve basophil study also undergo skin test three study visit .</detailed_description>
