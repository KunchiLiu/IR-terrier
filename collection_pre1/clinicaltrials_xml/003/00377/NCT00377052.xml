	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Bortezomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth block blood flow cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Bortezomib may help gemcitabine work well make cancer cell sensitive drug . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well give bortezomib together gemcitabine work treat patient relapse mantle cell lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bortezomib Gemcitabine Treating Patients With Relapsed Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : - Determine efficacy ( response rate ) bortezomib gemcitabine hydrochloride patient relapse mantle cell lymphoma . - Determine toxicity regimen patient . - Determine time progression duration response patient treat regimen . OUTLINE : This nonrandomized , multicenter study . Patients receive bortezomib IV day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month thereafter relapse/progression .</detailed_description>
