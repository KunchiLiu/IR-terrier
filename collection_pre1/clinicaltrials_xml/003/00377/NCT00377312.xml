	<brief_summary>Study consist eight day inpatient visit General Clinical Research Center . The investigator ' specific aim : 1 . To define maximum safe dose seven day continuous administration parathyroid hormone [ PTH ( 1-34 ) ] healthy human volunteer . 2 . To estimate effect seven day continuous administration parathyroid Hormone ( PTH ) escalate dos vitamin D metabolism , marker bone turnover fractional excretion urine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>7 Day Continuous Parathyroid Hormone IV Infusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study expand upon early infusion study demonstrate : 1 ) There dose-related increase 1,25 ( OH ) 2 vitamin D response PTHrP PTH multiple day . 2 ) There markedly attenuate vitamin D response PTHrP compare PTH , particularly second 24 hour . 3 ) The increase 1,25 ( OH ) 2 vitamin D almost certainly responsible great calcemic effect PTH compare PTHrP . 4 ) PTHrP obviously weak agonist 1,25 ( OH ) 2 vitamin D result suppression see Humoral Hypercalcemia Malignancy ( HHM ) . Thus , suppression 1,25 ( OH ) 2 vitamin D see HHM remain unexplained . In addition assess effect infusion PTHrP PTH calcium handle 1,25 ( OH ) 2 vitamin D , also measure effect marker bone turnover . Given clinical observation see Hyperparathyroidism ( HPT ) HHM , anticipate PTH would stimulate bone resorption formation , PTHrP would stimulate bone resorption inhibit formation . However , observed infusion PTHrP PTH result equivalent , rapid increase bone resorption measure N-telopeptide ( NTx ) C-telopeptide ( CTx ) , well progressive decline bone formation . There difference PTH PTHrP . We assume formation would ultimately increase additional time , see HPT , therefore examine additional group subject infuse PTHrP 96 hour . However , N-terminal propeptide type 1 procollagen ( P1NP ) continue decline even see HHM contrast HPT . We yet study long infusion PTH . One reason pilot study determine optimal dose PTH week period time . Intravenous PTH never infuse human being prolong period time . The investigator question whether prolonged continuous intravenous infusion PTH lead sustain progressive suppression bone formation occur HHM increase bone formation occur HPT . They also want assess direct influence long-term continuous PTH infusion plasma 1,25 ( OH ) 2 vitamin D regulation healthy human volunteer . We show previous study dose 8 picomoles ( pmol ) /kg/hr PTH give 48 hour result sustain mild serum hypercalcemia , serum calcium seem plateau range 11 - 11.5 mg/dL 48 hour . A dose 8 picomoles ( pmol ) /kg/hr also show cause desirable effect serum 1,25 ( OH ) 2 vitamin D marker bone turnover , may therefore `` ideal '' dose . However , know whether serum calcium plateau infusion 48 hour escalate dos whether continue increase seven day . To determine happen prolonged infusion , plan start dose low 8 picomoles ( pmol ) /kg/hr , gradually increase dose PTH successive group subject . In event significant adverse effect , immediate action take reverse . Protocols place follow event expect adverse event hypotension , nausea , muscle cramping . Severe sudden side effect anticipate ; however , mild easily reversible side effect expect outcome order determine optimal dose PTH . This study approve NIH Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) . Seventy five normal healthy men woman screen eight day in-patient admission General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) . Thirty evaluable research participant receive seven day infusion predetermine dose PTH . Vitals sign , blood pressure , blood urine lab result monitor frequently per study flow sheet . The start dose PTH , 2 picomoles ( pmol ) /kg , give three normal healthy subject . The dose escalate increment successive group three subject , early adverse effect ( mild hypercalcemia , postural hypotension , tachycardia ) see . This dose use future study . The investigator study try discover prolong continuous intravenous infusion PTH lead sustain progressive suppression bone formation occur HHM increase bone formation occur HPT . Subject Population consist healthy young adult , age 24-35 year , safety physiologic study . It anticipate need screen 75 subject order obtain 30 evaluable subject .</detailed_description>
