	<brief_title>Inner-City Anti-IgE Therapy Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study test medication call omalizumab treatment asthma . Immunoglobulin E ( IgE ) produce one expose allergen cause inflammation lung . Omalizumab reduce inflammation asthma attack block IgE . Unlike medication asthma , omalizumab inhaler medication pill . Instead , omalizumab dissolve liquid give injection . Studies indicate people live inner-city area likely expose indoor allergen difficult avoid people live area . The purpose study find add omalizumab standard asthma treatment result safer , effective , longer last asthma treatment strategy standard treatment alone . This study recruit inner-city child adolescent moderate severe allergic asthma . This study last 1.5 2 year . Participants randomly assign receive either omalizumab placebo injection every 2 4 week .
