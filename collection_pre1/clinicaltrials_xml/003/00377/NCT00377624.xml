	<criteria>The following information clinical trial provide information purpose allow patient physician initial discussion trial . This information intend complete information trial , contain consideration may relevant potential participation trial , replace advice personal physician health professional . INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients chronic shoulder pain follow : least 6 month , great 5 year duration without clinically significant improvement shoulder pain past one month , present least 50 % day previous month . 2 . Patients fail conventional therapy include limited following : NSAIDs ; one i.a . local periarticular steroid injection physiotherapy ( minimum one month previous physiotherapy treatment require . 3 . At screening , patient chronic analgesic/antiinflammatory medication VAS pain score &gt; /= 30 mm &lt; /= 90 mm indicate lack adequate sustain response previous current therapy . At screening , patient chronic analgesic/antiinflammatory medication VAS pain score &gt; /= 40 mm &lt; /= 90 mm . If bilateral shoulder pain present , investigator use painful shoulder . 4 . At baseline , analgesic/antiinflammatory medication discontinue 2 week , patient VAS pain score &gt; /= 40 mm &lt; /= 90 mm . 5 . Patients limitation shoulder motion least 1 direction screen baseline follow active range motion : Abduction scapula fix must &lt; /= 80° ; internal rotation abduction must , /= 55° , and/or external rotation abduction must 180° . These limitation shoulder motion comparison normal expect range . 6 . Patients retain active Range Of Motion ( `` ROM '' ) &gt; /= 30 percent direction screen baseline rule frozen shoulder . The ROM : &gt; /= 30° abduction scapula fix , &gt; /= 30° external rotation , &gt; /= 20° internal rotation . 7 . Patients least one follow condition examine determined Investigator : Osteoarthritis Glenohumeral Joint ( OA ) , Rotator cuff tear ( complete partial ) , Adhesive capsulitis shoulder . 8 .

Any cervical spine disease could confound clinical assessment ; chronic acromioclavicular disease , thoracic outlet syndrome , active epicondylitis , symptomatic carpal tunnel disease , musculoskeletal disease could confound diagnosis/evaluation painful shoulder , neurological etiology pain acute infection joint . 4 . Surgery study joint within previous 12 month . 5 . Inflammatory arthropathy rheumatoid arthritis , lupus , psoriatic arthritis Milwaukee shoulder . 6 . Frozen shoulder involve either shoulder . 7 . Patients clinically significant shoulder pain improvement past month . 8 . Gout calcium pyrophosphate disease involve upper extremity flare within previous 12 month . 9 . Intraarticular local periarticular corticosteroid injection study joint shoulder within previous 3 month ; joint within previous month ; oral corticosteroid within previous month . Steroid inhalant permit patient stable regimen past month remain regimen throughout course trial . Low dose aspirin ( 325 mg less ) antithrombotic treatment permit stable one month prior Screening stable throughout trial . 10 . Patients never receive i.a . periarticular corticosteroid therapy signal shoulder . This include patient contraindication ( ) corticosteroid . 11 . Intraarticular hyaluronan study joint within previous 12 month . Use glucosamineor chondroitin sulfatecontaining product unless Screening patient stable dos least 4 month willing remain stable dos throughout course trial . Use bisphosphonates unless Screening patient stable dos past month willing remain stable dos throughout course trial . 12 . Patients shoulder Xray finding acute fracture , severe loss bone density , vascular necrosis and/or severe deformity . 13 . Patients document evidence clinically significant shoulder joint deformity . 14 . If patient receive perform physical therapy screening , physical therapy regimen must stable onemonth precede screen remain stable throughout course trial . 15 . Patients primary extraarticular shoulder syndrome absence intraarticular disease uncomplicated impingement syndrome without limitation ROM , bursitis tendinitis without evidence adhesive capsulitis . 16 . Patients KellgrenLawrence Stage IV osteoarthritis glenohumeral joint . 17 . Any arthrogram signal joint within past 3 month . C. CONCOMITANT CONDITIONS , DISEASES , MEDICATIONS AND/OR CLINICAL HISTORY . 1 . Patients known allergy acetaminophen , lidocaine , hyaluronan , avian product . 2 . Patients require chronic analgesia condition ( include chronic pain contralateral shoulder another joint ) may interfere evaluation signal shoulder . 3 . Patients recurrent medical history severe allergic immunemediated reaction . 4 . Patients active infection skin vicinity potential injection site . 5 . Patients take agent report symptom relief arthritis disease/structure modify drug . 6 . Patients concomitant therapy anticoagulant . 7 . Patients intercurrent disease ( ) condition ( ) may interfere free use evaluation affect shoulder 6month course trial . 8 . Patients intercurrent chronic disease ( ) condition ( ) may predispose high probability interfere completion 6 month followup study peptic ulcer , liver disease , severe coronary disease , renal disease , cancer , pregnancy , alcoholism , drug abuse , mental state , clinically significant condition . 9 . Patients participate clinical trial within one month trial entry . 10 . In opinion clinical investigator clinically significant abnormal laboratory test result ( ) may place patient health risk , impact upon study , patient 's ability complete study . 11 .
