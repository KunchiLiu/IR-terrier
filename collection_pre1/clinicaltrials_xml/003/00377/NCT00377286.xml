	<brief_summary>The goal study 1 ) develop biomarker cartilage synthesis determine relationship change status knee cartilage amount biomarker call CTX-II urine . 2 ) We also characterize people experienced cartilage loss and/or reduce functional ability use performance test questionnaire . 3 ) The administration glucosamine beverage six month use promote alteration cartilage status improve function people mild moderate joint pain . A secondary goal ass effect glucosamine skin small subset woman .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Glucosamine Joint Structure Quality Life ( JOG )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Reduced knee function significant cause physical limitation disability . As cartilage deteriorates due age , wear-and-tear , injury , disease , joint space narrow pain develop . The lost articular cartilage arises imbalance cartilage synthesis cartilage degradation . When cartilage need remodel , enzymes matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) degrade type II collagen . It may possible use new molecular marker cartilage degradation ass progression joint loss comparison radiographic change knee joint . Urinary excretion C-terminal cross link telopeptide type II collagen ( CTX-II ) new molecular marker cartilage tissue degradation metabolism . Recent evidence suggest glucosamine , dietary supplement , may provide relief joint pain may increase functional ability participate activity daily live . This may result dietary supplement stimulate tissue repair cartilage affect joint , inhibit degradation cartilage inhibition enzyme . Moreover , Braham , Dawson , &amp; Goodman ( 2003 ) report increase function adult knee pain follow 12 -weeks glucosamine supplementation . It unclear , however , glucosamine deliver via liquid carrier would improve physical function impact quality life measure people experienced loss knee cartilage . Glucosamine precursor glycosaminoglycans , major component joint cartilage skin . Potential benefit glucosamine skin report previously . It possible glucosamine beverage might also improve skin parameter time . Comparisons : 100 men woman mild moderate joint pain take liquid glucosamine , compare 100 men woman mild moderate joint pain take liquid placebo .</detailed_description>
