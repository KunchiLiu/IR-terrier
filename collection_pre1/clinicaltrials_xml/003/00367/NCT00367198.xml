	<brief_summary>The mortality rate chronic hemodialysis ( CHD ) patient remain excessively high approach 21 % per year . Among many factor adversely affect patient outcome uremic malnutrition , unique form derange nutritional status . It associate increased hospitalization death risk CHD patient . Several measure identify prevent uremic malnutrition CHD patient , include effort optimize dialysis regimen dietary protein energy intake . A large number CHD patient suffer uremic malnutrition spite aggressive measure . The inevitable protein catabolic effect hemodialysis procedure important factor lead increased prevalence uremic malnutrition . Preliminary data suggest oral nutritional supplementation administer hemodialysis procedure counteract protein catabolic effect lead net protein anabolism acute setting . In proposal , hypothesize Pro-Stat , high nitrogen , enzyme-hydrolyzed , tryptophan-fortified , collagen protein supplement reverse net protein catabolism observe hemodialysis procedure .</brief_summary>
