	<brief_summary>This study examine role diet , lifestyle , gene , possible interaction cause Parkinson 's disease , use information NIH-AARP Diet Health Study . The NIH-AARP study establish 1995 examine role diet lifestyle cancer . It include 567,169 AARP member 50 old California , Florida , North Carolina , Pennsylvania , New Jersey , Louisiana , Atlanta Detroit metropolitan area . In 1995 , participant complete comprehensive questionnaire diet survey demographic , medication , well follow-up survey 1996 detailed question lifestyle medication , well cook method early life dietary habit . A third followup survey currently underway . The current NIH-AARP substudy Parkinson 's disease include approximately 9,000 participant NIH-AARP study - 3,000 report diagnosed Parkinson 's disease recent survey , 6,000 control subject . These study participant provide two saliva sample genetic analysis may ask complete telephone interview . In addition , Parkinson 's disease ask permission review medical information regard diagnosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Parkinson 's Genes Environment Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson disease ( PD ) second prevalent neurodegenerative disease , affect 1 million elderly Americans . The cause PD largely unknown , may include genetic environmental factor . We thus propose large study investigate role diet , lifestyle , gene potential interaction PD etiology , use NIH-AARP Diet Health Study . The AARP cohort establish investigator NCI recruit half million participant 1995 prospectively collect detailed information diet lifestyle . At baseline , participant 50 year old include 40 % woman . After 8 year follow-up , expect confirm 1,208 incident PD case neurologist . We comprehensively examine association diet lifestyle risk PD , focus dietary antioxidant , fat , caffeine , dairy product , estrogen use , obesity , physical activity , non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) . Further , collect saliva sample PD patient select control without PD genetic analysis . These result use explore PD association several common genetic polymorphism , first time , interaction several promise diet lifestyle exposure . Many specific aim novel important rarely examine previous investigation . The finding improve understand complex relationship among diet , lifestyle , gene-environment interaction , PD etiology may potentially contribute successful PD prevention strategy . Study Aims : 1 . Examine dietary factor may increase decrease PD risk . 2 . Examine lifestyle factor may increase decrease PD risk . 3 . Examine genetic polymorphism relation PD risk interaction diet lifestyle PD risk . Study Population : The NIH-AARP Diet Health Study cohort . Design : 1 . Longitudinal study first two study aim 2 . Nested case-control study third study aim . Outcome Parameters : Physician confirm PD diagnosis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : This study conduct within infrastructure NIHAARP Diet Health Study ; every participant AARP cohort eligible current investigation . Individuals PD baseline ( prevalent case ) miss information exposure variable still eligible study , may exclude specific analysis . The propose study require new recruitment . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : No child include . The analytic sample include participant respond followup questionnaires nonmissing value baseline survey . Participants report PD exposure assessment may exclude analysis .</criteria>
