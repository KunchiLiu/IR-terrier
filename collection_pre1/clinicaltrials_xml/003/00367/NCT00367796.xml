	<brief_summary>This study try find gene change responsible birth defect craniosynostosis , Philadelphia type . Craniosynostosis syndromes group condition result closure one fibrous joint bone skull brain growth complete . Because premature closure , brain able grow natural shape ; instead , compensate growth area skull joint yet close . The defect raniosynostosis , Philadelphia type , include skull malformation web finger toe . Gene change know involved craniosynostosis syndrome find Philadelphia type syndrome . Therefore , find genetic basis disorder provide important new information regard craniofacial limb development . This study include member single large family affect craniosynostosis , Philadelphia type . Participants 1 2 teaspoon blood draw genetic study . A second blood sample may request research . Some blood may use establish cell line later study . This involve grow white blood cell blood sample . The cell keep laboratory make DNA frozen later use craniosynostosis study . Patients may also medical record review .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Analysis Craniosynostosis , Philadelphia Type</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study determine molecular basis craniosynostosis , Philadelphia type . Previous study lab exclude FGFR1 , FGFR2 FGFR3 , causative gene hereditary craniosynostosis syndrome . In five generation kindred previously report conduct genome-wide linkage analysis . We identify four region link disorder , namely 2q , 12q , 20q 22q . Interestingly , syndactyly 1A , phenotypically similar disorder , demonstrate overlap linkage region two study . Screening candidate gene redion exclude ten candidate gene , include IHH , IGFBP2 IGFBP5 . This protocol primarily research purpose . Research subject may receive benefit know research may help family future . Results discuss primary physician train medical geneticist . We emphasize preliminary finding , CLIA-approved , must disclose patient include medical record . Repeat test CLIA-approved lab would require specific genetic information could share patient family .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : This research include craniosynostosis Philadelphia type patient member single family previously refer u family member since displayed interest participate study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Anyone unwilling provide inform consent ( adult , behalf child minor ) assent . Medical condition ( ) reason exclusion judgment refer physician would involve minimal risk . We generally review brief clinical description refer physician potential research subject determine subject appropriate enter study . We reserve right exclude case clearly related direct research interest . For new participant , review clinical description refer physician reserve right exclude case .</criteria>
