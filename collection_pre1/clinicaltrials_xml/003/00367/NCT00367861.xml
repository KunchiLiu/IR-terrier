	<detailed_description>Gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GISTs ) associate dismal prognosis localize advanced phase major resistance conventional chemotherapy agent . GIST cell positive KIT ( CD117 ) CD34 100 % 70 % case , respectively . Virtually malignant GISTs actually harbor activate mutation kit pathway tumor cell , lead ligand-independent activation KIT tyrosine kinase activity tumor growth vitro . Glivec® inhibit KIT activity IC50 approximately 100 nM similar require inhibiting tyrosine kinase associate Bcr-abl PDGF receptor . Experiments cell line contain activate juxtamembrane mutation ( similar find GISTs ) cell line contain transfected wild type KIT protein , show cell appear strongly dependent upon activity mutant receptor prevent apoptosis , thus provide scientific justification development Glivec® antineoplastic agent specific activity GIST KIT-driven malignancy . Since first single patient metastatic GIST treat Glivec® March 2000 ( 16 ) , 2000 patient include prospective trial test activity tolerance Glivec® patient advanced/metastatic GIST . High response rate document , limited percentage patient progress achieve objective response , median survival reach study . There clear demonstration dose-response relationship . About 15 % patient experience rapid disease progression treatment mechanisms resistance remain unknown . Some patient progress 400 mg/day respond high dos Glivec® . Toxicities infrequent , mainly mild moderate incidence seem related total daily dose administer . The optimal duration treatment Glivec® remain unknown . In addition impact surgical procedure tumoral residual mass yet evaluate progression free overall survival . The objective study determine feasibility Glivec® treatment interruption reintroduction progression GIST patient . Primary objective - To compare progression-free overall survival beyond 1 year patient treat Glivec® achieve CR , PR SD 5 year . Patients randomize 1 ) interruption Glivec® progression w/ RECIST criterion re-start ( group 1 ) v 2 ) maintenance Glivec® ( group 2 ) . Secondary objective - To compare overall survival two group randomize patient . - To determine progression free survival beyond 1 year patient CR , PR SD 5 year refuse randomization 1 ) select Glivec® interruption 2 ) choose Glivec® maintenance . - To determine CR , PR SD rate re-start Glivec® group 1 . - To assess number patient complete radical surgery tumour residual mass objective response . - To assess resource utilisation evaluate direct indirect cost . - To evaluate correlation serum rate Glivec® response treatment w/ RECIST criterion , patient diagnosis GIST treat Glivec® 400mg /day , progression , stop treatment study exit . - To follow immune modification induce Glivec® administration potentially related clinical response toxicity . - To realize possible sequence aim diagnosis KIT , order evaluate correlation exist response/or absence response Glivec® type mutation KIT . Overall study design : This open label clinical trial oral Glivec® 400 mg/day population patient metastatic and/or unresectable malignant GIST relapse . 564 patient enrol ten year 20-30 French Cooperative Centers . Treatment : Patients receive Glivec® 400 mg /day exposure period 60 month . At end 5 year period , patient non progressive disease propose randomization 1 ) interruption Glivec® progression w/ RECIST criterion re-start v 2 ) maintenance Glivec® . Patient refuse randomization propose either solution follow accord schedule . During treatment Glivec® 400mg/day , Glivec® may increase 600 mg/day 800 mg/day patient progressing . In case re-progression , patient exclude study . Signed informed consent study , include possible randomization , obtain .</detailed_description>
