	<brief_title>Directly Observed Antiretroviral Therapy Among Active Drug Users</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) dramatically reduce morbidity mortality HIV disease , benefit confer equally among patient population . Injection drug user ( IDUs ) show particularly less favorable outcome , HIV progression remain high level , IDU remain significant risk behavior spread HIV worldwide , explosive epidemic Eastern Europe , Russia , Southeast Asia . It therefore essential develop test strategy HIV treatment optimize outcome population , order reduce morbidity mortality curb secondary transmission . Directly observe therapy ( DOT ) tuberculosis result impressive improvement adherence clinical response mark reduction development resistance . The time-limited treatment tuberculosis , inherently different transmission pattern tuberculosis HIV , complexity antiretroviral therapy raise concern translate DOT model HIV . Successful , non-comparative demonstration program directly administer antiretroviral therapy ( DAART ) implement methadone maintenance program , community-based setting , skilled nursing facility , prison . None , however , target active drug user use prospective , randomize control trial ( RCT ) design rigorously determine efficacy DAART intervention improve HIV outcome among active drug user . One RCT DAART recently fail demonstrate impact virological outcome among low-income HIV+ patient , result unlikely applicable IDUs population demonstrate problematic adherence . We therefore conduct first randomize control trial address question , consist six month DAART versus self-administered therapy ( SAT ) among active drug user community set . The objective determine potential efficacy six-month DAART program HIV infection , use surrogate marker HIV- RNA level CD4+ T lymphocyte count .</detailed_description>
