	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Signed , write informed consent provide prior perform studyspecific procedure assessment . Subject must willing comply treatment followup . Subjects ≥21 year age life expectancy ≥12 week The time initial diagnosis schedule surgery date allows subject receive minimum 2 week maximum 6 week treatment pazopanib . Note : At least 4 week must available diagnostic biopsy surgery allow 1 ) oneweek delay follow diagnostic biopsy prior first dose study drug , 2 ) minimum 2 week study drug , 3 ) minimum 1 week wash prior surgery . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( PS ) 0 1 . Histologically cytologicallyconfirmed Stage IA , IB , IIA , IIB ( T2 ) NSCLC accord International Staging System [ Mountain , 1997 ] must schedule surgical resection . Disease must consist single lesion must measurable accord highresolution CT scanassisted volumetric measurement [ Yankelevitz , 2000 , Armato , 2004 ] . In addition measurable single lesion , small indeterminate nodule may also present No approve investigational anticancer therapy concurrently 6 month prior start study drug , include surgery , tumor embolization , chemotherapy , radiation therapy , immunotherapy , hormone therapy , biologic therapy , anti‑angiogegneic therapy ( e.g. , inhibitor VEGF VEGFR ) .

Female subject lactate discontinue nursing prior first dose study drug refrain nursing throughout treatment period 15 day follow last dose study drug . A male female partner childbearing potential eligible enter participate study use barrier method contraception abstinence study . Subjects must complete screen assessment outline protocol Exclusion criterion : Active malignancy malignancy 6 month prior first dose study drug . Concurrent disease condition would make subject inappropriate study participation include ( 1 ) unresolved unstable , serious toxicity prior administration another investigational drug , ( 2 ) serious medical disorder would interfere subject 's safety , obtain informed consent , compliance study related procedure . Major surgical procedure , open biopsy , significant traumatic injury within 4 week prior begin therapy , anticipation need major surgical procedure course study ; minor surgical procedure fine needle aspiration core biopsy within 1 week prior begin therapy also exclude .
