	<brief_summary>The purpose project analyze respiratory motion process relevant cardiac MRI image apply result development improve imaging method software correction . To accomplish , develop image protocol monitoring respiratory motion . The image protocol limit less five minute acquisition time may perform `` piggyback '' acquisition follow clinically prescribe image study pediatric adult cardiac MRI patient , also apply normal healthy volunteer . Hypothesis Characterization respiratory motion help improve image quality allow optimized scan acquisition retrospective correction acquire data .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use heavily research set use limit clinical practice , main reason artifact ( noise ) respiratory cardiac motion . To counteract source motion , many different application apply . For cardiac motion , ECG ( electrocardiogram ) gate widely use , respiratory motion reduction use method breath hold respiratory gate technique . Patients recruit base whether normal healthy volunteer patient already receive routine cardiac MRI . Normal Healthy Volunteers Patients recruit via flyer post various location Emory University . The content flyer adhere strictly Emory IRB Advertisement guideline . Subjects register contact Marijn Brunner , PhD , email telephone . Patients already schedule routine cardiac MRI The MRI technical specialist review laboratory schedule daily . Those already schedule routine cardiac MRI approach study staff member Children 's MRI Department . The patient ask he/she would wish enroll study . The patient request sign consent prior study procedure perform . MRI image data collect prescribed protocol respiratory monitoring . All MRI data acquire standard FDA approve image method . The image data transfer network Pediatrics Imaging Research Laboratory store password-protected computer analyze .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>We recruit two group patient 35 healthy volunteer ( 21 year old ) 25 cardiac MRI patient different age group . We wish recruit cardiac patient Children 's Healthcare Atlanta five ( 5 ) different category define overall characteristic breathe motion . The category : 1. neonates/infants ( shallow belly breathe ) 2. young child ( unable control breathe breathholding command , approximately 7 year age ) 3. old child capable control breathing/breathholding command ( approximately 812 year age ) 4. teenagers/adolescents/young adult ( age 13 17 ) 5. adult ( 18 old ) These category may adjust modify project deem appropriate base analysis result . We recruit 10 35 healthy volunteer subject scan define MRI image protocol respiratory motion monitoring . Healthy subject define individual prior history heart lung disease currently diagnose heart lung disease . This information obtain verbally subject screen process . No exclusion criterion place subpopulation base age , gender race patient freely give write informed consent history current diagnosis heart lung disease . However , normal exclusion criterion MRI exam still adhere : 1. subject pacemaker , medical implant , aneurysm clip , imbed metal fragment exclude potential effect magnetic field 2. woman pregnant may pregnant exclude potential high level RF power deposition fetus 3. subject may experience claustrophobia exclude inability remain magnet time required complete exam</criteria>
