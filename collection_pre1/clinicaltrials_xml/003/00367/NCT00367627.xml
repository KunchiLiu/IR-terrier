	<brief_summary>The common soil transmit helminthic infection ( STHI ) include infection Ascaris lumbricoides , Trichuris trichiura , Hookworm . Growth retardation , malnutrition , anemia , impaired cognitive function immunosuppression main manifestation child . Even within develop world , wide difference exist prevalence rate . The poor country high level STHI low incidence poverty . According estimate make WHO , prevalence A. lumbricoides , T. trichiura Hookworm South Asia 27 % , 20 % 16 % respectively . Given prevalence STHI urban slum Bangladesh much high part world Asia major health socio-economic consequence infection , important come effective mean reduce prevalence infection . 60-80 % preschool child urban slum Bangladesh infect STHI due poor hygiene . At present deworming six month interval recommend effectiveness regimen dewormig questionable . 2 . Hypothesis : Ante-helminthic treatment every three month effective ante-helminthic treatment every six month reduce soil transmit helminthic infection , reduce diarrheal respiratory illness improve nutritional status preschool child . 3.Objective : The main objective propose study compare relative efficacy two different ante-helminthic treatment regimen reduce prevalence STHI , diarrheal disease , respiratory illness improve nutritional status child 4 . Design : The population study preschool child age 2-5 year select randomly urban Dhaka . They divide two group randomly . One group get ante-helminthic every three month interval group get six month interval one year . Stool sample collect baseline three month complete one-year treatment mention regimen . Blood haemoglobulin nutritional status also measure baseline three month completion treatment mention . The treatment 400 mg Albendazole single dose . 5 . Potential Impact : The finding research implemented government non-government organization .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design population : The study population child age 2-5 year old study area . All child age 2-5 year old one slum study area list invited participate study . Parents explain purpose study ask write consent participation child study . If parent give consent stool pot give collect stool sample microscopic examination intestinal parasite . The inclusion criterion ; 1 ) age child 2-5 year old , 2 ) he/she suffer serious chronic illness , 3 ) child stool test must positive STH , 4 ) he/she take antehelminthic drug previous six month , 5 ) parents/guardian agree child participation study . The exclusion criterion ; 1 ) age child le 2 year old 5 year old , 2 ) his/her stool test negative intestinal helminth , 3 ) he/she suffer serious chronic illness , 4 ) parents/guardian willing give consent child 's participation study , 5 ) he/she receive antehelminthic drug survey study intervention . The survey do first month study , child enrol accord mention inclusion/exclusion criterion . During screen child find severely malnourish consider as'danger sign ' accord WHO IMCI guideline he/she refer appropriate facility even she/he enrol study . Simple randomization technique apply divide child two group : A ) Conventional treatment group receive anti-helminthic treatment 400 mg Albendazole single dose six month interval B ) Intervention group , receive anti-helminthic 400 mg Albendazole single dose treatment three month interval . Stool sample collect group prior anti-helminthic therapy examine quantitatively . However stool examination carry intestinal parasite give 400 mg Albendazole 12 month . Sample size calculation : Sample size calculate use different predict value different come variable show Table 1 . A sample size 200 child , 100 group sufficient study . Table 1 . Sample size calculation table Indicator Conventional treatment group Intervention treatment group Power study 95 % CI SD* Number group Total number adjust 10 % drop Cure rate 40 % 65 % 90 % 95 % - 78 170 HAZ &lt; -2 38 % 19 % 90 % 95 % - 84 184 Incidence E. histolytica infection per 100 child-year 20a 15 90 % 95 % 10 85 188 Average diarrheal episode per child 2a 1 90 % 95 % 1.5 48 106 Mean haemoglobin mg % 10a 12 90 % 95 % 4 85 188 Respiratory tract infection episode/child 6a 4 90 % 95 % 3 48 106 * SD = Within group standard deviation a= Data ongoing cohort study Mirpur Methods : Anthropometric measurement : Field Research Assistant train take weight height measurement child . Anthropometric measurement take trained FRA time enrollment every 3-months . Each child weigh light clothes electronic weigh scale . Inter-observer variation 2.5 % allow . The stand height child measure near 0.1 cm use locally construct height stick . Again inter-observer variation 2.5 % allow . Nutritional status assess compare weight height study child NCHS reference population age sex help Epi6 computer package program weight age `` Z '' score ( WAZ ) height age `` Z '' score ( HAZ ) compute ( 29 ) . Malnourished stunt defined WAZ score HAZ score &lt; -2 respectively . Other disease morbidity : Each study subject visit community health worker every week collect information ask parents/guardian accord structured questionnaire diarrheal disease , fever , cough etc . child retrospectively previous seven day . They work 6 day weekly every one visit 17 household per day morbidity data collection . Parents/guardian advise seek health care study physician study field office case illness study child . The study physician take history carry physical examination give treatment sick child . If child respond give treatment his/her condition deteriorate child seriously ill initially he/she referred appropriate referral facility treatment , treatment cost carry project . Asymptomatic E. histolytica infection treat . But symptomatic E. histolytica infection treat accord ICDDR , B Dhaka Hospital treatment guideline Intestinal helminth infection induce Th-2 immune response ( 27 ) , might favor others viral , bacterial protozoan infection . De-worming show improve antibody response ( 28 ) . In ongoing cohort study Mirpur find child heavy Trichuris trichiura ( TT ) infection suffer significantly E. histolytica associate infection ( un publish data ) compare child light infection TT . Based observation hypothesize frequent de-worming regimen associate less disease morbidtity like diarrheal disease , respiratory infection intestinal protozoan infection E. histolytica Clinical definition Diarrhea define three unformed stool 24 hour period . A `` diarrheal episode '' define separate another episode least 3 diarrhea-free day . Respiratory tract infection define 'Perceptions child cough , breathe faster usual short , quick breath difficulty breathing , exclude child block nose . ( 30 ) . No attempt do identify etiology respiratory infection . Cure rate STH infection ( CR ) : Cure rate STH infection define follow : - Prevalence enrollment - % prevalence end study CR = -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - x 100 % - Prevalence enrollment Laboratory method : Blood hemoglobin measurement : Study physician measure blood hemoglobin child enrollment end study period hemocytometer field site . ( 31 ) . Stool parasite examination : The community health worker collect stool sample qualitative quantitative intestinal parasite measurement every three month interval . The stool examine conventional microscopy qualitative measurement quantitative measurement intestinal helminthes Kato-Katz Formalin-ether concentration technique use . ( 32 ) .E . histolytica detect stool microscopy ELISA describe R Haque el ( 33 ) .</detailed_description>
