Monotherapy ICS often sufficient , along need short act bronchodilator agent , cost effective method manage patient mild-moderate persistent asthma . Alvesco , ICS ciclesonide deliver solution via HFA meter dose inhaler , show effective safe treatment persistent asthma . This study attempt document attribute patient mild-moderate persistent asthma . The collection patient report data accomplish number way . The standard system asthma trial daily diary transcribe paper form . While useful many study , system lack ability remind subject reporting time , time stamp report do note time report completion subject , area incomplete , remind patient take study medication .
