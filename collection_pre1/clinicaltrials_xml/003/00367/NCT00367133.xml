	<brief_summary>The study involve enrollment patient 18 year age diabetic macular edema ( DME ) . Patients one study eye randomly assign ( stratified visual acuity prior laser ) equal probability one three treatment group : 1 . Laser photocoagulation 2 . 1mg intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide injection 3 . 4mg intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide injection For patient two study eye ( eye eligible time randomization ) , right eye ( stratified visual acuity prior laser ) randomly assign equal probability one three treatment group list . The left eye assign alternative treatment ( laser triamcinolone ) . If leave eye assign triamcinolone , dose ( 1mg 4 mg ) randomly assign leave eye equal probability ( stratify visual acuity prior laser ) . The study drug , triamcinolone acetonide , manufacture sterile intravitreal injectable Allergan . Study eye assign intravitreal triamcinolone injection receive dose either 1mg 4mg . There indication treatment regimen well . Patients enrol study follow three year study visit every 4 month receive assign study treatment . In addition , standard care post-treatment visit perform 4 week intravitreal injection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diabetic retinopathy major cause visual impairment United States . Diabetic macular edema ( DME ) manifestation diabetic retinopathy produce loss central vision . Data Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study Diabetic Retinopathy ( WESDR ) estimate 15 year know diabetes , prevalence diabetic macular edema approximately 20 % patient type 1 diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , 25 % patient type 2 DM take insulin , 14 % patient type 2 DM take insulin . In review three early study concern natural history diabetic macular edema , Ferris Patz find 53 % 135 eye diabetic macular edema , presumably involve center macula , lose two line visual acuity two year period . In Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) , 33 % 221 untreated eye available follow-up 3-year visit , edema involve center macula baseline , experience 15 letter decrease visual acuity score ( equivalent double visual angle , e.g. , 20/25 20/50 , term `` moderate visual acuity loss '' ) . In ETDRS , focal/grid photocoagulation eye clinically significant macular edema ( CSME ) reduce risk moderate visual loss approximately 50 % ( 24 % 12 % , three year initiation treatment ) . Therefore , 12 % treated eye develop moderate visual loss spite treatment . Furthermore , approximately 40 % treated eye retinal thicken involve center macula baseline still thicken involve center 12 month , 25 % treated eye 36 month . Although several treatment modality currently investigation , demonstrate mean reduce risk vision loss diabetic macular edema laser photocoagulation , demonstrate ETDRS , intensive glycemic control , demonstrate Diabetes Control Complications Trial ( DCCT ) United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study ( UKPDS ) . In DCCT , intensive glucose control reduce risk onset diabetic macular edema 23 % compare conventional treatment . Long-term follow-up patient DCCT show sustain effect intensive glucose control , 58 % risk reduction development diabetic macular edema DCCT patient follow Epidemiology Diabetes Interventions Complications Study . The frequency unsatisfactory outcome follow laser photocoagulation eye diabetic macular edema prompt interest treatment modality . One treatment par plana vitrectomy . These study suggest vitreomacular traction , vitreous , may play role increase retinal vascular permeability . Removal vitreous relief mechanical traction vitrectomy membrane stripping may follow substantial resolution macular edema correspond improvement visual acuity . However , treatment may applicable specific subset eye diabetic macular edema . It also require complex surgical intervention inherent risk , recovery time , expense . Other treatment modality pharmacologic therapy oral protein kinase C inhibitor antibody target vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) investigation . The use intravitreal corticosteroid another treatment modality generate recent interest . The optimal dose corticosteroid maximize efficacy minimum side effect know . A 4mg dose Kenalog principally use clinical practice . However , dose use base feasibility rather scientific principle . There also experience use Kenalog dose 1mg 2mg . These dos anecdotally report reduce macular edema . There rationale use dose low 4mg . Glucocorticoids bind glucocorticoid receptor cell cytoplasm , steroid-receptor complex move nucleus regulate gene expression . The steroid-receptor binding occur high affinity ( low dissociation constant ( Kd ) order 5 9 nanomolar ) . Complete saturation receptor occur 20-fold high level , i.e. , 100-200 nanomolar . A 4mg dose triamcinolone yield final concentration 7.5 millimolar , nearly 10,000-fold saturation dose . Thus , effect 1mg dose may equivalent 4mg dose , compare 10,000-fold saturation , 4-fold difference dose inconsequential . It also possible high dos corticosteroid could less effective low dos due down-regulation receptor . The steroid implant study provide additional justification evaluate low dose , 0.5mg device delivers 0.5 microgram per day observe rapid effect reduce macular edema . There limited experience use dos great 4mg . Jonas ' case series report result use 25mg dose . However , others able replicate dose use preparation procedure describe Jonas . In trial , 4mg 1mg dos evaluate . The former use dose currently commonly use clinical practice latter reasonable evidence efficacy potential low risk . Although good reason believe 1mg dose reduce macular edema , possible retreatment rate high dose compare 4mg since latter remain active eye long duration former . Insufficient data available warrant evaluate dose high 4mg time .</detailed_description>
