	<brief_summary>One important approach change natural history advance breast cancer design new combination chemotherapy best drug already available use together new anticancer agent devoid clinical cross-resistance . The possibility exploit combine use cetuximab trastuzumab represent option potential great impact probability response long-term therapeutic result patient advance breast cancer HER2 overexpression.Therefore , patient tumor demonstrate EGFR expression clear-cut erbB-2 overexpression ( 3+ ) limit erbB-2 overexpression ( + 2+ ) include study . Patients treat trastuzumab cetuximab study pharmacokinetics potential drug/drug interaction antibody well safety tolerability novel combination treatment .</brief_summary>
