	<brief_title>Immunologic Basis Anti-IgE Therapy ( Study II : On Patients With Asthma )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IgE key molecule involve immediate hypersensitivity play major role pathogenesis allergic disease . Recently , therapy base use anti-IgE antibody develop pharmaceutical company , Genentech . A number clinical trial demonstrate antibody efficacious treatment allergy , include allergic rhinitis asthma . The medication Omalizumab ( Xolair ) recently approve FDA treatment asthma . The mechanism underlie beneficial effect therapy completely understood , likely relate mark reduction IgE level . Of note concomitant accumulation IgE-anti-IgE complex serum . Another remarkable effect treatment substantial reduction FcεRI level basophil , likely key factor contribute therapeutic benefit drug . The exist literature suggest reduction IgE level likely result down-regulation another IgE receptor , FcεRII/CD23 . Because known immunomodulatory function FcεRII , anti-IgE therapy may result alteration immune system , addition simple absorption IgE . We propose conduct mechanistic study anti-IgE therapy . The objective address anti-IgE therapy work might affect immune system general . The propose study also take advantage well-defined therapy address basic question regard immune system . Our hypothesis anti-IgE therapy may general effect immune system , reduce IgE-mediated antigen presentation antigen-presenting cell suppress allergen-specific IgE IgG production . The specific aim propose research : 1 . Determination effect anti-IgE therapy FcεRI expression basophil response . We first confirm anti-IgE therapy cause reduction FcεRI level basophil analyze whether occurs transcriptional level . We confirm therapy cause reduction basophil response cross-linkage FcεRI determine whether also affect basophil response induce non-IgE stimulus . The effect therapy FcεRI level skin mast cell also investigate . 2 . Determination effect anti-IgE therapy FcεRII expression antigen presentation . We determine whether therapy result down-regulation FcεRII/CD23 B cell . Because demonstrated function FcεRII/CD23 antigen presentation , determine antigen presentation T cell B cell anti-IgE-treated control subject . 3 . Determination effect anti-IgE therapy antibody production . We determine whether anti-IgE therapy result suppression IgE production , addition sequestration IgE . Whether IgE-anti-IgE complex directly suppress IgE production B cell vitro investigate .</detailed_description>
