	<brief_summary>While many effective option treat major depressive episode , clinical marker predict likelihood remission initial trial either antidepressant medication psychotherapy . More critically , also reliable predictor might anticipate failure standard treatment either alone combination . This project characterize imaging-based brain subtypes distinguish group depress patient later remit SSRI pharmacotherapy cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT ) , respectively . To define subtypes , prospectively-treated cohort 100 patient randomize receive either escitalopram ( s-CIT ) CBT first 12 week , non-remitters either first treatment cross receive additional 12 week treatment combine treatment . Non-remitters treatment thus define relatively treatment resistant third subgroup . Resting-state 18F-fluoro-deoxyglucose ( FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan acquire prior initiate antidepressant therapy , pre-treatment scan pattern associate three possible outcome ( CBT remission , s-CIT remission , non-remission ) assess use multivariate analytic method . A second PET scan , acquire early treatment course , use assess likelihood response specific treatment first assign . The proposed study first step towards define brain-based biomarkers predictive differential treatment outcome major depression ; critically , pattern distinguish patient risk treatment resistance . Identification biomarkers additional implication future test novel therapy patient distinct brain signature , include development evidence-based treatment algorithms individual patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC AIMS Aim 1 . To define baseline regional glucose metabolic pattern ( measure use FDG PET ) associate differential clinical remission two well-established , randomly deliver first-line antidepressant treatmentsâ€”the SSRI escitalopram ( s-CIT ) cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) cross-over treatment non-remitters ( sequential course treatment model ) . Aim 2 . To define metabolic change pattern , occur early course s-CIT CBT , associate successful unsuccessful clinical remission intervention .</detailed_description>
