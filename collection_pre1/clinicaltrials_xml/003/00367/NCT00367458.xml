	<brief_summary>This study examine effect atorvastatin , statin ( drug lower cholesterol ) human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . If treat , HIV infection cause incurable , progressive deficiency immune system lead death , usually disease take advantage weaken immunity . However , previous study suggest amount cholesterol infect cell reduce , multiplication HIV also reduce . In study , researcher examine HIV viral load , , amount virus blood . They evaluate composition strain virus patient carry ( HIV genotype ) , response immune system virus , gene may determine way drug may may work strain virus . Researchers plan enroll 22 participant , anticipate study last 30 week participant . Patients age 18 old HIV infection , pregnant breastfeeding , know allergy atorvastatin use , serious illness infection require hospitalization within 30 day enter study may eligible study . They assign random group : one receive atorvastatin receive placebo , effect cholesterol ability HIV infection multiply . Patients remain group treatment 8 week . At completion 8 week , matter study group , patient require discontinue study-related medication 4 week . After period , study assignment switch , previously take placebo take atorvastatin , vice versa . The study proceed another 8 week , follow period stop study-related medication patient observe 4 week . Throughout study , patient regularly schedule visit clinic . At visit collection blood sample , assessment symptom , physical examination , questionnaires complete . Blood test may require fast beforehand , blood sample use standard test , include regard liver , kidney , muscle , blood cell , pregnancy status . Specialized blood test determine viral load , effect drug immune cell , genetic influence drug 's effectiveness . The time spent procedure clinic visit ...</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial Atorvastatin HIV-Positive Patients Not Antiretroviral Medications With Specific Aims Studying Effects Atorvastatin HIV Viral Load Immune Activation Markers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol randomize , double blind , placebo control trial design study effect lipid lower statin , atorvastatin HIV-1 viremia . Untreated HIV-1 infection result incurable , progressive immunodeficiency death , usually opportunistic infection . Combination antiretroviral therapy ( ARV ) successful suppress HIV replication reduce morbidity mortality . Long term ARV therapy associate development HIV-1 drug resistance , significant adverse side effect include metabolic cardiovascular complication . Prolonged therapy certain antiretrovirals associate increase risk cardiovascular disease number dyslipidemic syndrome , include increase level cholesterol , LDL , triglycerides peripheral blood . New therapeutic strategy suppress HIV-1 infection essential . Previously , vitro study suggest exposure cholesterol-lowering statin result decrease HIV-1 replication . The mechanisms inhibition remain uncertain , possibility include disrupt membrane traffic cytoskeletal process necessary intracellular transport viral protein , alter cellular activation state necessary viral gene expression . Initial vivo study effect statins HIV-1 largely anecdotal nature yield conflicting result . Although statin therapy commonly use HIV-1 infection , adverse effect combination antiretrovirals statins possible . A thorough understanding effect statins HIV-1 replication essential determine potential therapeutic effect investigate risk benefit approach vivo . We plan conduct double blind randomized placebo control trial , cross design , study effect atorvastatin 22 HIV-infected patient currently take antiretroviral therapy . Patients randomize receive either placebo atorvastatin 80mg 8 week . After 4-week wash period patient atorvastatin arm crossover placebo , vice versa patient placebo arm cross atorvastatin additional 8 week . Upon completion study medication patient follow 4 week . Each arm minimum 11 patient . The primary outcome measure study effect lipid lower agent HIV-1 RNA level ; additional secondary outcome measure include effect lipid lower agent lipid profile , marker inflammation immune activation investigation host viral genetic factor .</detailed_description>
