	<detailed_description>Study design A randomized , open-label clinical trial design standardize P. vivax sporozoite challenge model malaria-naïve volunteer , specifically , relationship number infectious mosquito bite likelihood develop patent parasitemia detectable Giemsa-stained thick blood smear ( TBS ) . The study divide two step . Step A design produce mature P. vivax sporozoites suitable inoculation human ; Step B design assess safety reproducibility sporozoite challenge . For Step A , patient infective P. vivax gametocyte detect TBS recruit outpatient clinic Immunology Institute ( IDIV ) Cali Buenaventura , Colombia . Patients donate 35 mL whole blood , screen co-infections could potentially represent threat health volunteer . The blood artificially feed Anopheles mosquitoes.14 For Step B , malaria-naive subject expose bite 3 ± 1 , 6 ± 1 , 9 ± 1 infect mosquito determine prepatent period infection reproducibility . Blood donation blood quality assurance The EDTA vacutainer tube ( Becton Dickinson , Franklin Lakes , NJ ) use collect 35 mL whole blood infected patient , divide two aliquot : 15 mL sample mosquito feed 20 mL sample transport blood bank Valle del Lili Clinic routine screening panel common infectious agent ( viral , bacterial , parasitic ) , include confirmation Plasmodium specie ( P. vivax , P. falciparum , P. malariae ) polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) ( Table 2 ) .15 The rationale behind blood screen direct mosquito feed human volunteer base two premise : 1 ) standard blood bank screen universally accept safety procedure ensure pathogen transmit human-to-human blood transfusion . Therefore , blood sample determine negative pathogen P. vivax standard blood bank screen safe enough transfer human-to-human mosquito bite . 2 ) Anopheles mosquito report trans mit pathogen Plasmodium . Before study , carry extensive bibliographic search consult U.S. Colombian expert virology , parasitology , entomology potential pathogen might transmit Anopheles could represent threat volunteer expose challenge . There consensus yet pathogen report transmitted Anopheles mosquito , include comprise blood bank screening . However , mosquito discard use biosafety procedure feed blood confirm co-infection . Mosquito infection Anopheles albimanus mosquito Buenaventura strain , rear laboratory condition IDIV Cali 10 year . This mosquito colony successfully use regularly produce sporozoites14,16 study malaria transmission-blocking immunity.17 Here , mosquito feed within 2-3 hour P. vivax-infected blood ( gametocytemia ≥ 0.1 % ) collect Buenaventura . The 15 mL blood centrifuge 500 × g 5 minute room temperature , plasma remove , cell wash RPMI 1640 medium ( Gibco Cell Culture Systems , Invitrogen , Grand Island , NY ) . Parasitized erythrocyte reconstitute 50 % hematocrit pool human AB non-immune , complement-inactivated serum obtain Red Cross blood bank use infect lot 4,000 female mosquito ( 3-4 day old ) use water-jacketed membrane apparatus 37°C , describe previously.14 Infected mosquito maintain strict biosafety condition 27 ± 1°C relative humidity 82 % sugar solution supplement 0.05 % para-aminobenzoic-acid provided.18 Samples fed mosquito dissect microscopically examine 7-8 day blood meal determine presence oocysts midgut , Days 14 15 ass presence sporozoite salivary glands.19 Mosquito infection grade 1+ ( 1-10 spz ) , 2+ ( 11-100 spz ) , 3+ ( 101-1000 spz ) , 4+ ( &gt; 1001 spz ) .7 Sporozoite challenge The propose infective biting dose 3 , 6 , 9 mosquito , respectively . However , range plus minus one bite per dose allow . Therefore , screen-meshed box ( 7 × 7 × 7 cm ) fill 4 , 7 , 10 mosquito , good chance achieve target mosquito dose single biting round . Participants complete minimal target dose subjected second round biting . Eighteen malaria-naïve volunteer randomly assign one three group ( N = 6 ) expose group , few ( 3 bite ) great ( 9 bite ) number bite . Sporozoite challenge carry strict adherence experimental protocol secure room entomology unit IDIV . Volunteers ask use topical chemical ( e.g. , soap , deodorant , perfume ) could affect mosquito feeding . Mosquitoes allow bite flexor side forearm 10 15-minute period , previously determine sufficient full An . albimanus engorgement . After bite , mosquito dissect confirm presence blood meal sporozoite . Mosquitoes consider positive number sporozoite ( &gt; 1 ) detect microscopically . Study participant observe 1 hour entomology unit , follow phone 8 hour later , examine 24 hour thereafter assess response challenge . Malaria diagnosis patient follow-up From Day 7 post-challenge onward , volunteer daily follow-up visit symptom sign malaria assess blood collect TBS Plasmodium PCR ( latter perform retrospectively ) . The TBS perform use 50 μL whole blood collect finger prick spread rectangular area approximately 1.5 sq cm stain freshly prepared 10 % Giemsa stain.20 A total 300 microscopic field examine slide consider negative . When TBS find positive , parasitemia quantify estimate number parasite count presence 300 leukocyte calculate absolute parasitemia accord leukocyte count per μL . Smears read experienced microscopist random sample TBS subject quality control microscopist malaria control program . Participants treat anti-malarial drug soon parasite detect TBS . Treatment consist chloroquine ( 1,500 mg chloroquine base provide orally divide dos : 600 mg initially follow 450 mg give 24 48 hour later ) primaquine ( two 15 mg dos give per day 14 day ) . Volunteers provide intravenous fluid , analgesic , antiemetic need . Signs symptoms consistent malaria assess clinical examination grade 1-5 accord severity follow National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) criteria adverse event ( CTCAE ) follow : Grade 1 = Low , Grade 2 = Moderate , Grade 3 = Severe , Grade 4 = Serious , Grade 5 = Death . Pruritus grade 1 3 ( 1 = mild localize ; 2 = intense widespread ; 3 = intense widespread interfering activity daily live ) . Because common terminology AE agreement , edema erythema follow mosquito bite , adaptation CTCAE v 3 `` injection site/extravasation change '' use follow : Grade 1 = local pain/edema erythema ; Grade 2 = pain swell inflammation phlebitis ; Grade 3 = ulceration necrosis . Pain scored Grade 1 = mild interfere function ; Grade 2 = moderate pain ( pain analgesic interfere function , interfere activity daily live ) ; Grade 3 = severe pain ( pain analgesic severely interfere activity daily live ) . Clinical laboratory test Clinical laboratory screen -clouding electrocardiogram confirm health status volunteer 1 month challenge study complete ( Table 1 ) . Any abnormality find electrocardiogram consider exclusion criterion . Tests hemoglobin , white blood cell count , platelet count , total bilirubin perform Days 11 53 post-challenge . Statistical method Sample size ( N = 6 per group ) base minimum number individual would allow observe occurrence rarer event ( e.g. , event occur approximately 5 % individual ) reasonable probability base binomial assumption . The overall sample size 18 would sufficient detect even rare event . A titration mosquito bite ( bite dos ) establish ; begin arbitrarily consider minimum number require causing infection . Prepatent period duration symptom express geometric mean . Differences among group estimate Kruskal-Wallis test , consider statistically significant P value less 0.05 .</detailed_description>
