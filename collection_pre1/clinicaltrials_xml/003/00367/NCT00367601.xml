	<brief_summary>The strategy combine therapeutic agent cancer treatment successful multiple tumor type , include NSCLC . Erlotinib bevacizumab target different pathway involve tumor growth . Nonclinical study demonstrate combination bevacizumab erlotinib result great efficacy either agent alone . Furthermore , little overlap toxicity profile two agent , combination expect well tolerate may provide even great benefit patient unable receive cytotoxic therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This multi-center study . - Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg IV day 1 - Erlotinib 150 mg po qd day 1-21 - Disease Assessment even number cycle If progressive disease observe , continue ( combination single agent- see ) unacceptable toxicity progressive disease . If progressive disease observe , treatment discontinue . - Cycles repeat every 21 day total 6 cycle . - Patients non-progression 6 cycle may stay therapy ( single agent erlotinib combination ) progressive disease intolerable toxicity ( physician discretion ) . - Patients require discontinuation bevacizumab may receive investigator 's discretion erlotinib alone study progression . - Patients require discontinuation erlotinib may receive investigator 's discretion bevacizumab alone progression . ECOG Performance Status 2 Hematopoietic : - Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1,000 mm3 - Platelet count &gt; 100,000 mm3 - Hemoglobin &gt; 8 g/dl Hepatic : - Bilirubin &lt; 2 X upper limit normal . - Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST , SGOT ) &lt; 2.5 X upper limit normal 5 X liver involvement . Renal : - Urine protein : creatinine ratio 1.0 screen Cardiovascular : - Blood pressure &lt; 150/100 mmHg . - No history unstable angina . - No history New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Grade II great congestive heart failure . - No history myocardial infarction within 6 month prior registration protocol therapy . - No history stroke within 6 month prior registration protocol therapy . - No clinically significant peripheral vascular disease .</detailed_description>
