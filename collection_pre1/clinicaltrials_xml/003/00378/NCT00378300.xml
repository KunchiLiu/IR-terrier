	<brief_summary>The purpose study study clinical effect take probiotic patient moderate severe atopic dermatitis . There several study show improvement severity atopic dermatitis take probiotic . The mechanism improvement currently unknown . We propose probiotic improve atopic dermatitis stimulating , increase , activity special type cell call T Regulatory cell -- suppress activity allergic disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The central hypothesis study subset commercially available probiotic formulation ameliorate moderate severe atopic dermatitis child induce development T Regulatory ( Treg ) cell . We specifically hypothesize probiotic mixture induces Treg activity vitro , also improve severity atopic dermatitis specific patient induce Treg activity vivo . 1 . We determine whether probiotic mixture well able ameliorate severity atopic dermatitis compare patient treat placebo . We conduct 4-week randomize , double-blind , placebo control clinical trial design evaluate efficacy probiotic reduce clinical severity atopic dermatitis assess primary outcome measure , SCORing Atopic Dermatitis ( SCORAD ) index . We specifically hypothesize probiotic clinically improve disease . 2 . We assess whether probiotic mixture induce development T regulatory cell patient atopic dermatitis . A . We measure relative level Tregs peripheral blood probiotic placebo administration order ass whether probiotic mixture alter Treg development vivo , whether change correlate improvement clinical score . Primary outcomes measurement gene expression absolute increase cell population . We specifically hypothesize probiotic increase Treg activity . B . We also determine patient ' Tregs vitro response probiotic . This data use correlate whether clinical responder study also strong vitro response .</detailed_description>
