	<brief_summary>Bone marrow stem cell transplant ( otherwise call bone marrow transplant ) healthy donor sometimes mean cure hematological malignant disease acute chronic leukemia , myelodysplastic syndrome , myeloproliferative disease lymphomas . Before transplant patient receive chemotherapy radiation treatment reduce malignancy low level prevent rejection transplant . The transplant restores blood count normal replaces patient immunity donor . The donor 's immune cell increase effect transplant attack remain malignant cell . Donor immune cell ( especially call T lymphocyte ) also attack healthy non-cancerous cell tissue recipient cause `` graft-versus-host-disease '' ( GVHD ) . Strong GVHD reaction occur within week transplant life-threatening . In study remove T lymphocytes transplant minimize risk GVHD . However improve immunity residual malignant cell boost immunity infection , donor T cell ( store frozen time transplant ) give back around 90 day transplant reduce risk cause serious GVHD . Any patient 10 75 year age acute chronic leukemia , myelodysplastic syndrome , myeloproliferative syndrome lymphoma , family member suitable stem cell donor may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history various test examination .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Methods Enhance Safety Effectiveness Stem Cell Transplants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral blood stem cell transplant research carry National Heart Lung Blood Institute ( NHLBI ) Bonne Marrow Transplantation ( BMT ) Unit focus transplant technique design decrease graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) , increase graft-versus-leukemia ( GVL ) effect reduce risk post-transplant graft rejection . We find control stem cell ( CD34+ cell ) T lymphocyte ( CD3+ cell ) dose severe GVHD reduce whilst beneficial GVL effect preserve postponed donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) . We find T cell deplete transplant use Nexell/Baxter Isolex 300i system obtain high CD34+ dos deplete lymphocyte safe administer associate less severe acute GVHD promising response rate overall survival , combine delayed T cell add-back ( DLI ) . This protocol design evaluate safety efficacy improve T cell depletion procedure use Miltenyi CliniMACs system ( CD34 reagent system ) delay T cell add back HLA-matched peripheral blood stem cell transplant setting . The protocol accrue 68 subject age 10-75 hematological malignancy , allogeneic stem cell transplantation HLA-matched sibling would routinely indicate . 68 sibling donor also recruit . Diagnostic category include acute chronic leukemia , myelodysplastic syndrome , lymphoma , multiple myeloma myeloproliferative syndrome . Subjects receive myeloablative conditioning regimen cyclophosphamide , fludarabine total body irradiation , follow infusion stem cell product prepare use Miltenyi CliniMacs system CD34 selection , delay T-cell add back donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) day 90 . Older subject receive low dose irradiation reduce regimen intensity . Participants undergo apheresis collect lymphocytes research study . This procedure involve collect blood needle arm , extract lymphocyte cell separator machine return rest blood needle arm . Before treatment begin , patient central intravenous line ( plastic tube ) place vein neck . This line remain place transplant recovery period draw transfuse blood , give medication , infuse donate cell . To prepare patient transplantation immune system suppress combination chemotherapy radiation also help fight remain malignant cell . The chemotherapy consist two anti-cancer drug ( fludarabin cyclophosphamide ) infuse central line start eight day transplant . Patients receive eight dos total body irradiation , administer two 30-minute session per day 4 day . Patients 55 year age tolerate transplant less well young individual receive low dose radiation . One day preparative treatment finish , patient receive transplant donor ' stem cell infusion central line . Patients receive cyclosporine , immune-suppressing drug start 6 day transplant 21 day post-transplant . This help prevent transplant rejection GVHD . The drug stop allow donor immunity function restart day 89 prevent GVHD infusion T lymphocytes day 90 . Patients follow various test , treatment examination periodically first 3 year yearly thereafter . Primary endpoint overall survival day +200 . Non-relapse mortality day +200 monitor safety . Secondary endpoint standard transplant outcome variable non-hematologic toxicity , incidence severity acute chronic GVHD relapse disease .</detailed_description>
