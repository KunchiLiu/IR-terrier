	<brief_summary>Statement Problem : Over last several decade , scientist make great progress understand cardiovascular disease . Nevertheless , much remains learned cause , course , treatment cardiovascular disease . In order learn topic , important establish large database cardiovascular patient . These database allow scientist investigate , rigorous precise manner , factor influence cardiovascular disease . How Problem Will Be Studied : In present study , intend establish large database cardiovascular patient . More specifically , create database approximately 12,000 cardiac catheterization heart failure patient Emory University Hospital , Emory Clinic , Crawford Long Hospital , Grady Memorial Hospital . We collect large amount data patient . Data collect include information : 1. medical history patient 2. medical history patient 's family 3. health behavior patient 4. psychological status patient 5. result procedure patient undergoes , catheterization/angioplasty/bypass 6. biochemical marker patient blood sample , include genetic/DNA marker 7. follow-up information patient outcomes mortality re-hospitalization The data note collect : 1. administer questionnaires/interviews patient 2. access medical record patient 3. collect blood sample patient analyzed laboratory biochemical content . Once data collect , run variety statistical analysis help u learn factor cause various cardiovascular disease coronary heart disease , angina , heart failure , hypertension , stroke . The statistical analysis also help u understand disease treat effectively . How Research Will Advance Scientific Knowledge/Human Health : By collect large amount data large number cardiovascular patient , able analyze , great deal precision , factor influence onset , course , treatment cardiovascular disease . The result precise analysis use help optimize clinical effort prevent treat cardiovascular disease .</brief_summary>
