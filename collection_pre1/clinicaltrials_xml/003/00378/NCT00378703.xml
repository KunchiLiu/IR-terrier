	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study different combination bevacizumab , temsirolimus , sorafenib tosylate see well work compare bevacizumab alone treat patient kidney cancer spread place body . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Bevacizumab sorafenib tosylate may stop growth tumor cell block blood flow tumor . Temsirolimus sorafenib tosylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving different combination bevacizumab , sorafenib tosylate , temsirolimus may effective bevacizumab alone treat metastatic kidney cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess progression-free survival arm combination target therapy ( CTT ) compare bevacizumab alone . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess significance change tumor size early time point predictor progression-free survival ( PFS ) . II . To quantify number percent patient stable disease 6 month therapy ( failure progress ) treatment arm CTT patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . III . To evaluate safety treatment arm combination target therapy ( CTT ) patient metastatic RCC . IV . To assess overall survival arm study . V. To assess objective response rate treatment arm CTT patient metastatic RCC . VI . To assess pathology , angiogenesis histology assess activation status mitogen activate protein ( MAP ) kinase vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR2 ) pathways relate clinical outcome . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To analyze pharmacokinetic pharmacogenetic property sorafenib ( sorafenib tosylate ) include angiogenesis , monooxygenases polymorphisms multi-drug resistance ( MDR ) . II . To relate change tumor perfusion vascular permeability serial dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) clinical outcome radiologic regression detect standard method . III . To assess potential dynamic contrast-enhanced ( DCE ) -MRI image biomarker response therapy and/or prognostic indicator disease progression . IV . To assess site readiness ability acquire DCE-MRI data . V. To determine relationship tumor blood biomarkers clinical outcome patient treated combination target agent . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 1 15 . ARM B : Patients receive temsirolimus IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 bevacizumab Arm A . ARM C : Patients receive bevacizumab Arm A sorafenib tosylate orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-5 , 8-12 , 15-19 , 22-26 . ARM D : Patients receive sorafenib tosylate PO BID day 1-28 temsirolimus Arm B . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
