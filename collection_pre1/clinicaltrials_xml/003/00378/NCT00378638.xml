	<brief_title>Dose-Dense Chemotherapy Plus Bevacizumab High Risk Lymph Node Positive Breast Cancer : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 200,000 woman diagnose breast cancer United States every year . A significant factor determine long-term survivability breast cancer whether lymph node , gland cleanse filter body 's fluid , involve . Despite treatment approve multiagent cytotoxic chemotherapy ( `` dose-dense chemotherapy '' ) , woman breast cancer involve 4 axillary lymph node still high risk recurrence . Several dose-dense chemotherapy regimens currently compare study , however , time proof one regimen superior another . Therefore , attempt decrease metastasis , prolong time recurrence improve overall survival , essential develop novel therapeutic strategy . The use inhibitor angiogenesis represent promising option . Bevacizumab first angiogenesis inhibit drug FDA approve , treatment colon cancer . It also study alone progressed lymph-node positive breast cancer show moderate efficacy . This study observe efficacy tolerability use bevacizumab combination approve dose-dense chemotherapy regimen 8 cycle , follow 12 bevacizumab alone . Patients may study 52 week disease progress regimen tolerate .</detailed_description>
