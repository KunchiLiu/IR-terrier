	<brief_summary>This study collect blood DNA sample patient inherited eye disease use research identify genetic factor responsible condition . In recent year , nearly 500 gene contribute inherit eye disease identify . Disease-causing mutation associate many eye disease , include glaucoma , cataract , strabismus , corneal dystrophy number form retinal degeneration . As result , gene-based therapy pursue treat eye genetic disease consider untreatable . The National Ophthalmic Genotyping Network ( eyeGENE ) create national tissue repository advance genetic research inherit eye disease , time provide clinically-useful information back patient physicians request it.. Physicians collaborate institution recruit patient participate study . Patients provide blood sample undergo standard eye examination . The blood sample clinical information send NEI test , process store tissue repository . Patients give option receive result back and/or re-contacted event future clinical study . Information supply test laboratory include unique identification number , patient gender , patient date birth . The stored sample make available researcher along information patient 's disease , without patient identifier .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Molecular genetics potential revolutionize diagnosis treatment inherit eye disease . Progress research inherit eye disease would augment availability patient DNA couple robust , anonymous phenotypic information . The National Ophthalmic Genotyping Phenotyping Network ( eyeGENE ) create answer need . We propose creation national DNA blood repository inherit eye disease . These sample gather clinical center around nation couple anonymous , phenotypic descriptor . If request , portion sample submit clinician use appropriate , CLIA-certified molecular diagnostics use patient care . Once sufficient repository create , researcher able request aliquot laboratory experiment . Participants provide option re-contacted approve clinical study might qualify offer . Researchers able request aliquot laboratory experiment ask eyeGENE Coordinating Center re-contact participant inform possibility participate clinical study</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : To participate protocol : 1a . The participant must present characteristic meet minimal clinical criterion establish eyeGENE , determine refer clinician . OR 1b . The participant must relative affected participant analysis would help interpretation affect participant 's test result obtain useful information decide eyeGENE Research Study Group . 2 . The participant must willing able provide suitable blood sample . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Severe systemic disease compromise ability refer clinician obtain adequate eye examination . Any disease condition make unsafe subject provide blood sample least 5 ml child least 15ml adult . Inability cooperate phlebotomy clinical examination . Those impaired decisionmaking capability legallyauthorized representative . If clinical criterion information , consent form , blood sample provide doctor participant one year submit blood sample eyeGENE .</criteria>
