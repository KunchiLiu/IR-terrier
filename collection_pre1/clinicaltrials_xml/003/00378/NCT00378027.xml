	<brief_title>Arixtra PE Study- Outpatient Management Stable Acute Pulmonary Embolism : Once Daily Subcutaneous Fondaparinux</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current standard therapy Acute Pulmonary Embolism ( APE ) involve admit patient hospital administration parenteral anticoagulation therapy ( Unfractionated Heparin , Low Molecular Weight Heparin , Fondaparinux ) bridge oral Vitamin K Antagonists ( warfarin { Coumadin } ) . There group patient low risk adverse event thus may amenable outpatient management . Newly identify cardio-specific biomarkers , cardiac troponins ( TNT cTnI ) brain natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) offer add diagnostic information show help risk stratify patient present APE . Use biomarkers could help separate low- high-risk subject , particularly subgroup patient , despite hemodynamic stability presentation , carry high risk adverse event . Once low risk APE group identify , less complex less resource-intensive equally efficacious safe treatment allow early discharge would desirable . The current reference therapy intravenous unfractionated heparin ( UFH ) initial anticoagulation minimum 4-5 day overlap therapeutic INR achieve . Although low-molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) widely use DVT treatment , use patient APE limit inpatient administration . Fondaparinux sodium ( Arixtra ) synthetic specific inhibitor activate Factor X ( Xa ) . Several study show fondaparinux effective enoxaparin use venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) prophylaxis agent . Additionally , publish literature date , report case heparin-induced thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) syndrome proven cause fondaparinux . Fondaparinux approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment acute pulmonary embolism administer conjunction warfarin sodium initial therapy administer hospital . By mean non-randomized , open label pilot study , seek prospectively assess safety efficacy outpatient treatment use fondaparinux oral Vitamin K antagonist ( warfarin ) patient stable acute pulmonary embolus validate risk stratification criterion predict patient suitability outpatient therapy acute pulmonary embolism .</detailed_description>
