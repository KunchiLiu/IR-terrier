	<brief_summary>The present study design attempt prospectively evaluate randomize fashion whether cytotoxic dose intensification , deliver two sequential autologous stem-cell transplantation , improve outcome young patient newly diagnose multiple myeloma comparison single autologous transplantation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Transplantation Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following demonstration single autologous transplantation treatment young patient newly diagnose multiple myeloma prolong overall survival comparison conventional chemotherapy , double autologous transplantation test , initially refractory myeloma subsequently include also patient newly diagnose disease . To explore role double autologous stem-cell transplantation part up-front therapy multiple myeloma , 1996 launch prospective , randomized trial compare single course stem-cell-supported melphalan regimen follow , three six month , second autologous transplantation support melphalan busulfan . The study design detect 15 percent increase complete near complete response rate double transplant compare single transplantation . With 2-sided significance level α = 0.05 power 1-β = 0.80 , 162 patient require treatment arm study detect statistically significant increase complete near complete response rate 30 % single-transplant arm 45 % double-transplant arm . Primary study endpoint complete near complete response rate . Secondary study endpoint relapse-free survival , event-free survival overall survival . The recruitment target 324 patient .</detailed_description>
