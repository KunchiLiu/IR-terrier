	<brief_title>ACROSS-Cypher Total Occlusion Study Coronary Arteries 4 Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite remarkable advance procedural clinical outcome percutaneous revascularization , chronically occlude coronary artery remain formidable challenge unresolved dilemma interventional cardiology . Although TCO identify approximately one-third diagnostic cardiac catheterization , still attempt revascularization account less 8 % percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . Such disparity frequency treatment underscore technical procedural frustration associate complex lesion , also clinical uncertainty regard clinical benefit conventional TCO revascularization ongoing inadequacy current PCI method sustain restenosis-free patency follow initial success . Until recently , clinical investigation perform support clinical benefit TCO revascularization . In addition relief symptomatic ischemia , theoretical advantage include enhanced leave ventricular function , reduce predisposition arrhythmic event , improve tolerance future ischemic event . In Survival Ventricular Enlargement ( SAVE ) trial , persistent occlusion infarct-related artery associate relative risk 1.47 adjust 4-year mortality ( P=0.04 ) . Since , limited number study document long-term outcome follow intend TCO revascularization perform . This investigational protocol design evaluate safety efficacy Cypher® sirolimus elute coronary stent ( Cordis Corporation , Miami Lakes , FL ) patient undergo elective revascularization nonacute total coronary occlusion ( TCO ) . Specifically , approximately 200 patient undergo Cypher® sirolimus elute coronary stent ( ) implantation follow successful cross native total occlusion coronary guidewire . The study conduct approximately 17 site North America . Patients include trial schedule percutaneous revascularization non-acute de novo TCO native vessel visually estimate accommodate ≥3.0 mm diameter angioplasty balloon . Important exclusion criterion include recent myocardial infarction ( &lt; 72 hour ) general contraindication procedure schedule clinical angiographic follow-up . Patients may also undergo treatment non-target vessel lesion simultaneous index procedure within certain protocol-specified provision . All patient undergo plan angiographic follow-up 6 month follow index procedure evaluate primary endpoint restenosis ( &gt; 50 % diameter stenosis ) within treated/working length segment compare result obtain use methodology among patient undergo TCO revascularization heparin-coated Palmaz-Schatz coronary stent ( Cordis Corporation , Miami Lakes , FL ) Total Occlusion Study Canada-1 ( TOSCA ) ( 1 ) . Important secondary endpoint include occurrence major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) target vessel failure ( TVF ) 30 day , 6 month 12 month post-procedure . In addition , angiographic outcomes in-stent segment restenosis within stent segment examine . Further , patient enrol trial clinical follow-up annually five year .</detailed_description>
