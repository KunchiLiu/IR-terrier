	<brief_title>Sunitinib Treating Patients With Recurrent Persistent Leiomyosarcoma Uterus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess activity sunitinib malate , term rate progression-free survival ≥ 6 month objective tumor response , patient recurrent persistent leiomyosarcoma uterus receive 1 2 prior cytotoxic therapy . II . Determine frequency severity adverse event . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine duration progression-free survival overall survival . OUTLINE : This multicenter study . Patients receive oral sunitinib malate daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 42 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year . PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 44 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
