	<brief_summary>We treat subset patient paraneoplastic neurologic disorder , include Yo-mediated paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration ( PCD ) , Hu syndrome , commonly associate small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) - paraneoplastic subacute sensory neuropathy , encephalomyelitis , limbic encephalopathy , autonomic neuropathy - Ri Syndrome ( a.k.a . Paraneoplastic Opsoclonus-Myoclonus Ataxia ) , well patient suspect paraneoplastic neurologic disorder characteristic antibody yet identify . Our treatment protocol consist immune suppression therapy use tacrolimus ( FK506 ) , potent inhibitor lymphocyte proliferation commonly use prevent organ transplant rejection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients may stay either in-hospital treated Tacrolimus , receive treatment outpatient , combination two . Additionally , patient sick treat Rockefeller University ( RU ) ( eg . patient actively seize ) , need urgent treatment , may treat either Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center New York-Presbyterian Hospital . During treatment , patient undergo blood draw , set interval ( see section g ) , clinical evaluation , possibly repeat leukapheresis large volume blood draw , lumbar puncture ( see ) . Since many patient live far away New York , procedure may perform RU staff conjunction local MDs . Patients terminate Tacrolimus treatment 7-21 day follow outpatient evaluation neurologic medical status . Wherever possible , patient see day 3 10 post treatment termination , biweekly basis two month . Since many patient live far away New York , may instead monitor conjunction local MDs . Patients show definite clinical response Tacrolimus may maintain therapeutic dose one year , follow outpatient . For patient receive retreatment , may treat inpatient outpatient basis , discretion PI , schedule patient treat initially . Long term improvement decline neurologic function objectively assess neurologic exam , quantify use Karnofsky scale ( measure functional neurologic status ) . Since vast majority Hu patient decline 6-12 month period follow diagnosis , stable improve Karnofsky score time period take measure successful treatment . Repeat lumbar puncture ( eight per year ) leukapheresis large volume blood draw ( approx . 100 cc ) may perform ( four per year ) , especially set neurologic change , ass immune response medication .</detailed_description>
