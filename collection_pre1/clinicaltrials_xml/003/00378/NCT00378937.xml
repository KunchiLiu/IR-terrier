	<brief_title>Oxycodone Standard Pain Therapy Treating Patients With Cancer Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Compare overall pain management patient cancer-related pain treat oxycodone hydrochloride vs standard three-step analgesic therapy . - Compare health economics regimens patient . Secondary - Explore factor inform patient ' decision commence opioid analgesia . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter , randomize , parallel group , pilot study . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . - Arm I : Patients receive analgesic regimen , accord level pain , 18 week . - Step 1 : Patients mild pain receive oral acetaminophen 4 time daily . - Step 2 : Patients mild-to-moderate pain receive oral codeine oral dextropropoxyphene hydrochloride 4 time daily oral acetaminophen 4 time daily . - Step 3 : Patients moderate-to-severe pain receive oral morphine oral oxycodone hydrochloride 6 time daily ( every 4 hour ) without non-opioid analgesic . Patients may also receive adjuvant drug ( i.e. , side effect primary indication pain management analgesic select circumstance ) . - Arm II : Patients receive oral oxycodone hydrochloride twice daily 18 week . Patients may receive different opioid analgesic analgesia adjuvant medication arm I , need . Patients arm may also receive additional medication breakthrough pain . Patients complete patient-assessment booklet ( PAB ) daily include Box-Scale ( BS ) -11 rating average pain ; question regard contact ( e.g. , telephone visit ) healthcare professional day ; information regard number time escape medication use . Quality life level cancer pain assess use short form Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week . Peer Reviewed Funded Endorsed Cancer Research UK PROJECTED ACCRUAL : A total 30 patient accrue study .</detailed_description>
