	<criteria>PATIENTS : All consecutive STEMI patient &gt; =18years arrive Cath Lab hospital ( invasive facility center ) transfer . Transfer respect registry define patient reach Cath Lab hospital : 1. transfer surround regional community hospital Cath Lab hospital establish referral pattern 2. pickedâ€“up ambulance equipped/staffed provide specific medical therapy ( like prehospital thrombolysis upstream abciximab ) . Usually physician specifically trained nurse board . CENTRES : Provide 24 hour/7 day duty PCI service . Has establish regional hospital referral network &gt; =8 patients/month arrive transfer ( define ) . A rate &gt; =10 % transfer patient receive upstream abciximab transfer Cath Lab hospital . Start abciximab ER CCU Cath Lab hospital consider upstream start abciximab . Patients arrive Cath Lab pathway specify ( a. b . ) , e.g . come ambulance provide specific medical therapy arrive directly ER Cath Lab hospital feet/car include registry . Patients control clinical trial shall include long actual treatment fully know . Thus , participant randomize trial blind treatment include registry .</criteria>
