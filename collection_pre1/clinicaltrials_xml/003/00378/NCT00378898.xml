	<brief_title>Feasibility Placing Bravo PH Capsule Proximal Esophagus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>24-hour pH monitoring often consider `` gold standard '' diagnosis GERD increasingly utilized patient extra-esophageal symptom ( 1 ) . However , clinical utility pH monitoring patient population remain controversial . An important limitation traditional pH catheter suboptimal sensitivity especially patient extraesophageal GERD . Vaezi et al . test reproducibility reliability proximal distal esophageal pH probe 32 patient ( 2 ) . Among patients,11 control , 10 distal reflux , 11 proximal distal reflux . In group patient sensitivity distal proximal pH probe 70 % 55 % , respectively . Additionally , recent study Shaker et al . show number duration hypopharyngeal reflux event similar control subject patient reflux laryngitis vasomotor rhinitis ( 3 ) . Poor sensitivity catheter base pH monitoring detect acid reflux may due day day variability test , less adequate reliability well possible intermittent nature reflux event ( record 24-hour period ) ( 4 ) . Additionally , since traditional ambulatory device commonly place transnasally oropharynx esophagus , patient often complain throat nose discomfort usually restrict daily activity . This potentially lead false negative finding reduce test sensitivity . Furthermore , incorrect result may collect pH electrode slip away initial manometrically determine placement site . In light limitation , new wireless ( catheter free ) pH monitoring device develop improve patient comfort increase test sensitivity . The Bravo pH monitoring system ( Medtronic Inc , Minneapolis , MN ) use radiotelemetric capsule temporarily attach esophageal mucosa transmits pH data receiver carry patient 's belt . Although well study distal esophagus , currently study adults assess feasibility patient tolerance placement device proximally . Such placement may increase sensitivity test add ability study potential predictor treatment response patient extraesophageal GERD .</detailed_description>
