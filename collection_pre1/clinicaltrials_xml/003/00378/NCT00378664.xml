	<brief_title>Lumbar Sacral Ventral Nerve Re-Routing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spinal cord injury ( SCI ) spina bifida source irreversible injury spinal cord often result paralysis loss sensation waist . The inability urinate normally consequence condition ( neurogenic void dysfunction ) . In spina bifida spinal cord injury , nerve control bladder sphincter ( muscle squeeze bladder neck prevent leak ) may longer work properly result patient urinate constantly wet . Most patient maintain high pressure bladder elevate pressure eventually take toll cause recurrent urinary tract infection , backup urine kidney , mark dilatation possible damage kidney . Many patient eventually suffer irreversible renal ( kidney ) damage , dialysis kidney transplant way sustain life . Spinal bifida ( present birth ) SCI ( occurs often early fourth decade life ) predominately affect young individual longevity quality life may greatly reduce presence bladder , bowel , sexual dysfunction . In recent past , medication catheter way help cord injure patient empty bladder . Although clean intermittent catheterization ( CIC ) provide good maintenance result , medication help conserve low bladder pressure , antibiotic sustain infection free urinary tract , difficult bladder management program uphold . They expensive , time consuming , outcomes inconsistent . A new surgical procedure potential treatment spinal cord injuries/ spinal bifida . Recently , Dr. Chuan-Guo Xiao China develop surgical procedure rewire nerve spinal cord gain well control urination avoid complication neurogenic bladder . The procedure reconnects live wire ( nerve ) dead wire .</detailed_description>
