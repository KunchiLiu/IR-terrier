	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study determine whether locally advanced breast cancer respond ( shrink , progress destroy ) combine chemotherapy ( gemcitabine , epirubicin paclitaxel ) give surgery patient locally advance breast cancer . This study also evaluate toxicity chemotherapy combination patient determine survival progression-free survival 2 year treatment . Also , study look whether molecular genetic change tumor tissue match tumor 's response chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Gemcitabine , Epirubicin , Paclitaxel Combination Chemotherapy Given Before Surgery Patients With Locally Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary chemotherapy establish role locally advance breast cancer . Studies show combination chemotherapeutic agent superior single therapeutic agent overall response rate progression free survival . The inclusion active drug combination regimens improve percentage patient achieve pathological complete response ( pCR ) . The chemotherapy agent gemcitabine , epirubicin , paclitaxel use individually treat breast cancer . While use combination three drug study metastatic setting , combination evaluate locally advanced disease . In study combination three agent gemcitabine , epirubicin , paclitaxel [ Taxol ] administer patient locally advance breast cancer prior surgery ; pathologic response determine time surgery . The main objective study determine pathological response rate patient . Also prior study suggest specific subset tumor respond specific chemotherapeutic agent subset determine gene expression profile tumor , preoperative therapy protocol provide ideal set identify gene expression pattern gene copy number change may predict response specific therapy use high-throughput assay method RNAlater . Therefore , study also look feasibility tissue collection analysis identify predictive marker complete pathological response .</detailed_description>
