	<brief_summary>This research do look effect experimental drug , ranibizumab , treatment condition call `` idiopathic parafoveal telangiectasia '' IPT . IPT cause swell retina ( light sensitive tissue back eye ) due leaky blood vessel area . Swelling retina lead blurry vision .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ranibizumab Idiopathic Parafoveal Telangiectasia ( RIPT ) Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomize , interventional case series . A total 10 patient , see Retina Division Wilmer Eye Institute , enrol . Subjects randomize either 0.3 mg 0.5 mg intravitreal injection ranibizumab . Patients IPT macular edema document optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) choroidal neovascularization eligible study . Exclusion criterion include form retinopathy , active intraocular inflammation , history poor vision due condition IPT either eye , know hypersensitivity humanize monoclonal antibody . After obtain informed consent , patient undergo baseline assessment include best-corrected Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) visual acuity , ocular examination , color fundus photography , fluorescein angiography , OCT . If eye eligible , study participant investigator choose eye consider study eye . The study eye assign random receive intravitreal dose ranibizumab ( 0.3 mg/0.05 ml 0.5 mg/0.05 ml ) baseline , 1 month , 2 month visit . Further monthly injection discretion examiner , may withhold lack continued improvement ( defined lack improvement least 5 letter eye chart compare 2 previous consecutive visit lack decrease retinal center point thickness least 50 micron compare 2 previous consecutive visit ) complete success ( define visual acuity 20/20 good retinal center point thickness &lt; 225 micron ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Subjects eligible follow criterion meet : 1 . Ability provide write informed consent comply study assessment full duration study . 2 . Age &gt; 18 year 3 . Diagnosis bilateral IPT macular edema document OCT evidence choroidal neovascularization . 4 . Best correct visual acuity well equal 20/200 eye Subjects meet follow criterion exclude study : 1 . Known hypersensitivity humanize monoclonal antibody 2 . History ( within past 6 month ) evidence severe cardiac disease ( apparent electrocardiogram abnormality , clinical history unstable angina , acute coronary syndrome , myocardial infarction , revascularization procedure within 6 month prior baseline , atrial ventricular tachyarrhythmias require ongoing treatment ) . 3 .
