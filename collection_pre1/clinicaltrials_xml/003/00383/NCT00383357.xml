	<detailed_description>Awakening sleep well document impair cognitive performance young adult . This phenomenon , call sleep inertia , report impair performance much one night total sleep deprivation , suggest significant functional consequence sleep inertia . However , whether walk stability impaired sleep inertia unknown . If sleep inertia impairs walk stability , could important currently unrecognized risk factor fall old adult . Also , impact age sleep inertia-related impairment cognitive performance unknown . Sleeping medication use high old young adult , risk factor fall . Current evidence suggest sleep medication impair walk stability cognitive performance young old adult wakefulness ; however , study examine walk stability cognitive performance young old adult upon awaken sleep night take hypnotic ( sleep medication ) . Therefore , purpose study determine whether sleep inertia hypnotic use impairs walk stability cognitive performance healthy old healthy young adult . It expect finding propose study provide evidence sleep inertia risk factor fall old adult . Twelve old ( age 60-85 ) twelve younger ( age 18-35 ) healthy male female volunteer participate study . The investigational procedure include medical screening ( e.g. , physical , blood urine test , bone mineral density assessment ) , home monitoring sleep schedule three week , three overnight visit laboratory space approximately one week apart . During laboratory visit , participant awaken middle night perform walk stability cognitive function test . Before go bed , participant take either placebo pill sleep medication . On one visit , participant ask go bed 2 hour later usual .</detailed_description>
