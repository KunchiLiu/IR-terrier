	<brief_summary>Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) silent killer may go undetected year . It lead cause death limitation geographic boundary account 16.7 million death world wide . Different study show South Asians population prone CAD emerge epidemic . According study conduct Karachi estimate overall prevalence cardiovascular disease Pakistan 26.9 % 23.7 % men 30.0 % woman . However tool measure CAD adequately validate . This study design develop screening tool determine test characteristic Rose Questionnaire Minnesota Coded ECG alone combination diagnosis CAD , use MPI gold standard Pakistan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design : The propose study cross sectional study population sample 450 subject age &gt; 40 year , stratify gender , reside 12 randomly select community Karachi , Pakistan . The target population study would draw exist population base study entitle “ Population base strategy effective control high blood pressure Pakistan ” ( parent study ) , conduct primary supervisor study director ( TJ ) Karachi Subjects age &gt; 40 year would eligible . Detailed information participant would obtain data collect parent study . This include ) socio-demographic characteristic level education , occupation , economic status , ethnicity , tobacco use , physical activity define basis International Physical Activity Questionnaire , dietary habit ( food frequency questionnaire ) , family history CAD , WHO standard Rose questionnaire ( RQ ) coronary artery disease ( CAD ) ( b ) anthropometry include height , weight , waist hip circumference ( c ) laboratory test include fast blood glucose , lipid profile , serum creatinine , urine albumin creatinine ratio . The community health worker ( CHW ) would administer RQ obtain 12-lead EKG . They would give appointment subject MPI Aga Khan University Hospital . Each individual go exercise treadmill test ( symptom limit Bruce modify Bruce protocol ) able walk , pharmacological stress infusion dobutamine dipyridamole unable walk . The result MPI study would deliver subject interpretation cardiologist , referral physician ( appropriate ) . Classification Screening instrument : ECG Minnesota cod two trained independent coder , discrepant report resolve third independent coder . All case probable possible CAD Minnesota cod ECG would classify “ MC ECG positive CAD ” RQ cod accord standardize criterion “ positives `` angina '' `` history possible infarction '' . Presence either one would classify “ RQ positive CAD ” .</detailed_description>
