	<brief_summary>The purpose study explore effect synthetic gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) upon pituitary ovary woman infertility . Women diagnose GnRH deficiency , hypothalamic amenorrhea , acquire hypogonadic hypogonadism , polycystic ovarian syndrome ( PCOS ) participate study . It hop administration GnRH lead proper stimulation pituitary gland normal ovulation menstruation . **WE ARE CURRENTLY RECRUITING ONLY WOMEN WITH A DIAGNOSIS OF IDIOPATHIC HYPOGONADIC HYPOGONADISM ( IHH ) ** Pulsatile GnRH approve FDA use woman primary amenorrhea due complete GnRH deficiency . The overall goal protocol continue use pulsatile GnRH GnRH-deficient woman ovulation induction examine specific physiologic hypothesis , address patient population , examine efficacy pulsatile GnRH ovulation induction subset anovulatory patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In comparison use exogenous gonadotropin , pulsatile administration GnRH many theoretical advantage ovulation induction , include ; 1 ) ability use patient ' gonadotropin ovarian stimulation ; 2 ) ability treat anovulatory defect appropriate level , commonly hypothalamic ; 3 ) ability maintain normal ovarian-pituitary feedback mechanism restrain endogenous FSH secretion , occur normally specie ovulate single egg per cycle ; 4 ) resultant decrease risk multiple gestation hyperstimulation ; 5 ) decrease need intensive monitoring ovarian function attendant decrease cost . When synthetic GnRH first become available clinical study , yet adequate understanding physiology GnRH secretion human support potential therapeutic application . As result , early attempt ovulation induction unsuccessful . It soon appreciate episodic mode delivery essential normal pituitary stimulation GnRH . Studies group others define frequency pulsatile GnRH secretion normal woman different stage menstrual key design physiologic program pulsatile GnRH administration result successful ovulation induction patient GnRH deficiency . Additional study demonstrate replacement GnRH use subcutaneous route adequate reproduce normal physiology GnRH-deficient men , intravenous route superior woman . We determine dose GnRH appropriate majority woman 75 ng/kg , dose induces ovulation single dominant follicle , follow normal luteal phase dynamic . A number investigator include u sought define specific subgroup likely achieve great benefit form therapy . However , many question remain unanswered currently address . We specifically interest understanding variability dose GnRH require apparently GnRH-deficient woman recently determine one patient require significantly high dose GnRH reproduce normal cycle dynamic , mutation GnRH receptor rather deficiency GnRH . We recently determine response gonadotropin free a-subunit may help refine phenotype patient idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism . In addition , actively recruit patient polycystic ovarian syndrome ( PCOS ) . Patients PCOS variable response pulsatile GnRH subsets anovulatory patient seek determine specific patient characteristic , predict success . This important group patient particularly challenge term ovulation induction gonadotropin , susceptible ovarian hyperstimulation , cycle cancellation and/or multiple gestation . One major factor associate anovulation insulin resistance compensatory hyperinsulinemia . Improving insulin resistance , use insulin-sensitizing agent metformin , show improve ovulatory function patient PCOS undergo ovulation induction clomiphene exogenous gonadotropin . The combination metformin pulsatile GnRH address population . It important note minor include protocol , many patient extremely anxious know whether respond normally pulsatile GnRH even though may interest conceive time . This particularly true patient survive childhood cancer associate surgery and/or radiation normal response pulsatile GnRH positive experience . Minors PCOS administer Metformin part protocol .</detailed_description>

Women minor hypothalamic amenorrhea history secondary amenorrhea least six month duration low normal gonadotropin history primary amenorrhea presence pulsatile pattern LH FAS baseline frequent sample study , weight 10th 90th percentile height accord Sargent scale normal testosterone prolactin level . Women minor acquire hypogonadotropic hypogonadism history hypothalamic pituitary tumor treat surgery alone combination radiotherapy history hypothalamic irradiation adjunctive therapy leukemia craniofacial neoplasm . There must minimum 2 year since irradiation gonadal radiation . For previous two month , patient euthyroid thyroid replacement need , normoprolactinemic dopamine agonist need , receive physiologic glucocorticoid replacement need . Subjects otherwise healthy woman female minor age 16 45 year gonadal steroid preparation least 1 month . Subjects normal complete blood count ( hemoglobin great equal 11.5gm/dl ) thyroid function test negative pregnancy test . Patients screen clinical evidence mitral valve prolapse suspect undergo cardiac ultrasound evaluation . The presence ballooning mitral valve cause exclusion patient intravenous GnRH treatment .</criteria>
