	<detailed_description>Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) common chronic anxiety disorder often debilitate follow exposure overwhelm traumatic event . The burden PTSD individual society significant . The majority PTSD sufferer also meet diagnostic criterion several psychiatric disorder many attempt suicide . Despite devastate impact PTSD live million worldwide , little known etiology pathophysiology disorder . Although disruption hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal ( HPA ) Axis , noradrenergic , serotonergic system propose neurobiological substrate development PTSD , exact underpinnings neurobiology PTSD remain fully elucidate . PTSD responsive treatment selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , response rate rarely exceed 60 % , even few patient ( 20 % -30 % ) experience improvement could characterize remission . Thus , clear need develop novel improve therapeutic PTSD . A grow body preclinical evidence suggest activation Substance P ( SP ) receptor NK1 anxiogenic NK1 antagonist , upon chronic administration , exert significant dampening ( albeit complex ) effect SP-NP system . Furthermore , several stress paradigm believe exert many deleterious effect hippocampal structure via enhancement SP-NK1 system . Overall , excess activity SP-NK1 system stand prime candidate involvement pathophysiology anxiety disorder PTSD . In study , propose investigate potential antianxiety efficacy highly specific NK1 antagonist GR205171 PTSD . Furthermore , propose , preliminary fashion , longitudinally investigate whether neuroendocrine surrogate marker predictive treatment response . This 8-week double-blind placebo-controlled study examine efficacy safety NK1 antagonist patient PTSD . Patients , age 18 65 year diagnosis PTSD , pilot study randomize double-blind treatment receive either NK1 antagonist , GR205171 ( 5 mg/day ) placebo period 8 week . Approximately 52 patient enter study obtain 40 subject complete 8 week acute NK1 antagonist treatment .</detailed_description>
