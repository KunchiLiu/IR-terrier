	<criteria>&gt; =12 year , either sex , race , asthma diagnosis &gt; =12 month consistent follow : Diagnosis base clinical history &amp; examination , pulmonary function parameter &amp; response beta2agonists , accord international guideline . Been use low daily dose inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) ( either alone combination longacting beta agonist [ LABA ] ) &gt; =12 week &amp; stable asthma regimen &gt; =2 week prior Screening . Low daily dos ICS : 200500 mcg beclomethasone chlorofluorocarbon ( CFC ) , 100250 mcg beclomethasone hydrofluoroalkane ( HFA ) , 200600 mcg budesonide dry powder inhaler ( DPI ) , 5001000 mcg flunisolide , 100250 mcg fluticasone , 200 mcg MF , 4001000 mcg triamcinolone acetonide , 80 160 mcg ciclesonide . Note : Dose delivery method/modality must equivalent . No harm change current asthma therapy investigator , subject ( legal representation , applicable ) must willing discontinue his/her ICS ICS/LABA combination prior initiate MF MDI runin medication Screening Visit , &amp; transfer openlabel treatment MF MDI 100 mcg BID 23 week prior Baseline Visit . To document diagnosis asthma &amp; assure responsiveness bronchodilator randomization 1 used Screening Visit thereafter , prior Baseline Visit : Demonstrate increase absolute FEV1 &gt; =12 % &amp; &gt; =200 mL within approximately 15 20 minute administration 4 inhalation albuterol/salbutamol ( total dose 360400 mcg ) nebulized shortacting beta agonist ( SABA ) ( 2.5 mg ) confirm standard office practice , OR Demonstrate peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) variability &gt; 20 % express percentage mean high &amp; low morning prebronchodilator ( take albuterol/salbutamol ) PEF &gt; =1 week , OR Demonstrate diurnal variation PEF &gt; 20 % base difference prebronchodilator ( take albuterol/salbutamol ) morning value &amp; postbronchodilator value ( take albuterol/salbutamol ) evening , express percentage mean daily PEF value . At Screening Visit , FEV1 must &gt; =60 % &amp; &lt; =90 % predict . At Baseline Visit , FEV1 must &gt; =60 % &amp; &lt; =85 % predict restricted drug withhold appropriate interval . Lab test Screening Visit must normal acceptable investigator/sponsor include serum pregnancy female childbearing potential ) . Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) Screening Visit , use centralize transtelephonic technology must acceptable investigator . Chest xray perform Screening Visit within 12 month prior Screening Visit must acceptable investigator . Subject ( legal representation , applicable ) must willing give write informed consent &amp; able adhere schedule . A nonpregnant woman childbearing potential must use birth control . Includes : hormonal contraceptive include hormonal vaginal ring , hormonal implant depotinjectable ; Intrauterine device ( IUD ) ; medically prescribe topicallyapplied transdermal contraceptive patch ; condom combination spermicide ; monogamous relationship male vasectomy . Started birth control method &gt; =3 month prior Screening ( exception condom ) , &amp; must agree continue use . Female childbearing potential currently sexually active must agree &amp; consent use birth control , become active . Women surgically sterilize &gt; =1 year postmenopausal consider childbearing potential . Female must negative serum pregnancy test Screening . Increase/decrease absolute FEV1 &gt; 20 % time Screening Visit &amp; include Baseline Visit . Pulmonary function test ( PFTs ) perform morning . &gt; 8 inhalations/day SABA MDI &gt; =2 nebulized treatments/day 2.5 mg SABA 2 consecutive day Screening Visit &amp; include Baseline Visit . Decrease AM/PM PEF Screening Period stability limit 2 consecutive day prior randomization . Asthma deterioration result emergency treatment , hospitalization , treatment additional , exclude asthma medication ( include oral systemic corticosteroid , allow SABA ) judge investigator time Screening Visit &amp; include Baseline Visit . Treated emergency room ( ER ) ( severe asthma exacerbation require systemic glucocorticosteroid treatment ) admit hospital management airway obstruction within last 3 month . Ever required ventilator support respiratory failure secondary asthma . Upper/lower respiratory tract infection within previous 2 week prior Screening &amp; Baseline Visits . Visits reschedule 2 week complete resolution . Smoker exsmoker &amp; smoke within previous year cumulative smoking history &gt; 10 packyears . Significant abnormal vital sign . Evidence upon visual inspection significant oropharyngeal candidiasis Baseline earlier without treatment . If evidence Screening PreBaseline Visit , may treat appropriate &amp; Baseline Visit schedule upon resolution . History significant renal , hepatic , cardiovascular , metabolic , neurologic , hematologic , ophthalmologic , respiratory , gastrointestinal , cerebrovascular , , judgment investigator , could interfere study require treatment might interfere study . Examples include ( limited ) insulindependent diabetes , hypertension treat betablockers , active hepatitis , coronary artery disease , arrhythmia , significant QTc prolongation ( ie QTcF QTcB [ Fridericia Bazett correction , respectively &gt; 500 msec ) , stroke , severe rheumatoid arthritis , chronic openangle glaucoma posterior subcapsular cataract ( include prior cataract surgery ) , acquire immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , condition may interfere respiratory function chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , chronic bronchitis , emphysema , bronchiectasis , cystic fibrosis . Others wellcontrolled &amp; stable ( eg hypertension require betablockers ) prohibit participation deem appropriate investigator .
