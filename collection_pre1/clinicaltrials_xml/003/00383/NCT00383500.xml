	<brief_title>Lymphedema Prophylaxis Breast Cancer Survivors Who Show Early Evidence High-risk Status</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current investigation design prospectively evaluate potential simple , effective lymphedema prophylaxis breast cancer survivor show early evidence high-risk status . There grow evidence mechanism lymphatic repair injury mediate lymphatic flow . Accordingly , study assess physical measure design prophylactically augment lymphatic flow surgical intervention breast cancer ( eg , Flexitouch manual lymphatic massage ) reduce incidence lymphatic stagnation , assess incidence lymphedema , compare patient receive conventional `` watch wait '' intervention ( observation ) . The specific aim study 1. prospectively assess presence newly develop lymphedema study subgroup serial assessment segmental interstitial fluid content multiple frequency bioimpedance 2. evaluate preventive intervention prospective , randomized fashion , contrast response equivalent number patient randomize 2 experimental arm control arm study 3. correlate bioimpedance finding concurrently derive , serial assessment limb volume Recent advance medical understanding biological process lymphatic development repair suggest mechanism may able manipulate enhance regenerative response lymphatic vasculature follow injury . Breast cancer-associated lymphedema model acquire form lymphatic vasculature insufficiency . Clinically , pose substantial clinical problem . It estimate 1woman 4 survives breast cancer intervention develop lymphedema , often progressively . The appearance lymphedema document adverse effect physical psychologically well-being . New insight lymphatic repair suggest mechanism employ prophylactic fashion forestall eliminate development lymphedema . This proposal investigate hypothesis prospective fashion , use randomize trial design 80 patient enrolled time breast cancer surgery . If investigation document beneficial effect preventive measure , could profound impact subsequent breast cancer care . These measure simple cost-effective , could help eliminate impact substantial detractor improve longevity health breast cancer survivor otherwise may expect enjoy .</detailed_description>
