	<brief_summary>Treatment facial lipoatrophy dermal injection polylactic acid ( Newfill TM ) safe procedure widely use good efficacy . However , therapy effective treat patient benefit injection may decrease time necessitate re-injections several month first set injection . In study would like compare efficacy safety Eutrophill ( polyacrylamid gel ) , resorbable filler compound versus Newfill comparative , randomise , multicenter trial . Primary endpoint self-perception patient visual analogue scale ( VAS index ) . Secondary endpoint quality life questionnaire ( MOS-HIV ) , a-NBC questionnaire ( perception patient doctor severity lipoatrophy ) , measure dermal thickness cheek skin fold assess Skinfold Caliper , order digital photographs evaluation dermal thickness CT scan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Intradermal Injections Newfill Versus Eutrophill Treatment Facial Lipoatrophy HIV-infected Patients ANRS 132 SMILE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study compare efficacy safety Eutrophill ( polyacrylamid gel ) , resorbable filler compound versus Newfill ( polylactic acid ) comparative , randomise , multicenter trial patient-blinded study , treatment facial lipoatrophy HIV-infected patient , one year first injection ( week 48 ) . The efficacy assess measure median self-perception index patient visual analogue scale ( VAS index ) .The study compare treatment , week 48 , week 72 week 96 versus baseline : median increase VAS index , rate treatment failure , score 2 patients-questionnaires ( a-NBC MOS-HIV ) , order digital photograph , median increase facial dermal thickness cheek dermal skin fold assess Skinfold Caliper . The study compare week 48 week 96 versus baseline : median increase dermal thickness assess CT scan face . Safety assess frequency nature immediate delay side effect .</detailed_description>
