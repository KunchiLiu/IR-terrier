	<brief_summary>This multicenter , randomize , phase II study evaluate safety efficacy oral ATN-224 plus temozolomide patient advance melanoma . Patients randomize ( 1:1 ) temozolomide ATN-224 temozolomide follow ATN-224 . Patients assign sequential treatment group receive temozolomide progression disease document receive ATN-224 single agent documentation progression disease use last tumor assessment temozolomide therapy baseline assessment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Trial ATN-224 Temozolomide Advanced Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According National Cancer Institute PDQ database , advance melanoma refractory standard systemic therapy , newly diagnose patient consider candidate clinical trial . Although advanced melanoma relatively resistant therapy , several biologic response modifier cytotoxic agent report produce objective response . Once melanoma metastatic , treatment palliative rather curative . In spite many attempt multimodality therapy , prognosis disease remain poor . Further agent need progress make melanoma treatment . ATN-224 orally active , small molecule show cellular animal model antiangiogenic activity melanoma cell line . Clinical study similar agent ( ammonium tetrathiomolybdate ) indicate agent administer continuously daily basis year patient . ATN-224 potential affect progression melanoma mechanism include antiangiogenic antitumor pathway . Temozolomide , commonly use agent melanoma , also tolerable profile .</detailed_description>

Patients may adjuvant treatment prior early disease long give least 6 month first dose study medication , treatment contain temozolomide dacarbazine . Previous treatment advance disease acceptable long patient receive temozolomide dacarbazine . There restriction number prior regimen . Age ≥18 year Life expectancy great 6 month Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤2 ( Karnofsky ≥50 % ; see Appendix A ) Patients must adequate organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/uL platelets ≥100,000/uL hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL total bilirubin ≤2 X institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2 X ULN creatinine clearance ( measure calculate ) ≥30 mL/min Patients allow receive erythropoietin blood transfusion receive first dose ATN224 bring hemoglobin level &gt; 9 g/dL meet eligibility criterion . Use adequate contraception . Temozolomide potential cause fetal harm . The effect ATN 224 develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown , antiangiogenic agent know teratogenic . For reason woman childbearing potential men partner childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal and/or barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation follow visit 28 day last dose ATN 224 temozolomide .
