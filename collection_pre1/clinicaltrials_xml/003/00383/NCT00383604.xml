	<brief_title>Breast Cancer Lymphedema : Role Insulin Resistance/FOXC2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lymphedema arm important , under-recognized , under-treated complication successful surgical radiotherapeutic treatment breast cancer . As result advance early detection effective adjuvant therapy , many woman diagnose breast cancer today expect survival similar age-matched woman without breast cancer . Nevertheless , source substantial physical psychological morbidity attract sufficient attention industry scientific research community result either effective risk stratification availability highly effective therapeutic intervention . While presence degree arm edema , part , correlate extent axillary surgery , still comprehend poorly factor predispose overt lymphatic insufficiency patient risk lymphedema virtue prior breast cancer treatment . It likely anatomic regenerative variability relies , least part , upon yet undefined genetic substrate . A grow body evidence suggest mutation nuclear transcription gene FOXC2 responsible broad clinical array primary lymphedema syndrome . The biology breast cancer-associated lymphedema , include characteristic latency phase , suggest similar mechanism may operate predisposition form secondary lymphedema . In parallel , breast cancer-associated lymphedema several clinical attribute suggest relationship , role , insulin resistance . In regard , interest contemplate recent , multiple line evidence suggest gene FOXC2 regulate , directly indirectly , several aspect adipocyte metabolism genetic variability gene may influence feature associate insulin resistance metabolic syndrome . These observation particular interest recognize relationship FOXC2 haploinsufficiency variety identify lymphedema syndrome . It therefore attractive conjecture insulin resistance , perhaps mediate polymorphisms FOXC2 , .confers secondary lymphedema risk predispose yet poorly understood tendency breast cancer survivor acquire substantial , pathological deposit adipose tissue affect extremity chronicity lymphedema . The specific aim proposal follow : ( 1 ) quantitatively assess insulin sensitivity late breast cancer survivor , equally divide among subject display clinical evidence ipsilateral arm edema ; ( 2 ) correlate presence relative insulin resistance expression breast cancer-associated lymphedema . It hypothesize approach capability lead future elaboration appropriate risk stratification target therapeutic intervention ; ( 3 ) pilot investigation , sequence FOXC2 gene , include untranslated 5 ' region , patient , identify potential polymorphism might correlate presence insulin resistance lymphedema risk .</detailed_description>
