	<brief_summary>Vaccination influenza high priority elderly population present high morbidity mortality rate . However , due weak antibody response improvement immune response influenza vaccination remain unmet medical need . The purpose investigational influenza vaccine candidate administer alternate route improve immune response vaccine elderly population , could provide additional reduction influenza-associated morbidity mortality population . Primary Objective : To demonstrate investigational vaccine induces well immunogenicity reference vaccine term seroprotection rate first vaccination . Secondary Objectives : Immunogenicity : To describe antibody persistence induce vaccine 3 , 6 , 12 month first vaccination subset subject . To describe immunogenicity investigational vaccine vaccination use parameter define European Medicines Agency ( EMEA ) Note Guidance ( CPMP/BWP/214/96 ) specific elderly subject . Safety : To demonstrate tolerance investigational vaccine first vaccination , term pre-defined solicited systemic reaction . To describe safety profile vaccination . To describe effect repetitive injection safety profile .</brief_summary>
