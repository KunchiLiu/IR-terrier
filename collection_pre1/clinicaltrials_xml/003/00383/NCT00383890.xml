	<brief_title>A Safety Efficacy Study Dexmedetomidine Patients Requiring Sedation Elective Awake Fiberoptic Intubation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An awake fiberoptic intubation indicate patient anticipate difficult airway anatomy , airway trauma , morbid obesity , unstable cervical spine injury . An awake fiberoptic intubation non-sedated patient extremely stimulating , uncomfortable , unpleasant . The clinician must focus maintain spontaneous breathing , hemodynamic stability , patient 's comfort . The term `` awake '' fiberoptic intubation use distinguish procedure fiberoptic intubation perform general anesthesia . Although patient may sedate `` awake '' fiberoptic intubation , need responsive capable maintain airway without assistance . Vital component successful awake fiberoptic intubation include anesthesiologist experienced technique , adequate topicalization airway , sedate yet cooperative subject . Benzodiazepines , combine opioid , commonly use anxiolysis and/or analgesia awake fiberoptic intubation . Dexmedetomidine sympatholytic , sedative , analgesic , anxiolytic effect attenuate catecholamine response perioperative stress . Dexmedetomidine sedate patient decrease sympathetic activity level arousal . Further , dexmedetomidine find facilitate decrease salivary secretion , desirable effect fiberoptic intubation . An estimated 100 subject ( 50 DEX , 50 PBO ) schedule elective awake fiberoptic intubation potentially difficult airway randomize prior intubation approximately 18 investigative site .</detailed_description>
