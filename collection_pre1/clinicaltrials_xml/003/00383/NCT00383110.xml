	<detailed_description>Background/Significance : Diabetes mellitus chronic progressive disease cause significant morbidity mortality increase health care utilization cost Veteran Administration ( VA ) non-VA setting . 1 . Diabetes complication prevalent minority population . Black Americans two-fold increase age adjust rate diabetes , likely develop experience great disability diabetes complication compare White Americans . 1 . Black Americans diabetes high rate retinopathy , end-stage renal disease , low limb amputation , overall death rate . 2 . Therefore , diabetes significant public health problem Black American patient disproportionately high morbidity mortality White American counterpart . Several factor postulate explain disproportionately high morbidity mortality diabetes Black Americans include mistrust health care system . 3 . It think distrustful patient less likely seek routine medical care , take prescribed medication consistently , adhere treatment recommendation , maintain continuity health care provider health care system . 4 . Recent study show Black Americans less trust physician health care system . 5 . However , little know association trust diabetes outcomes whether distrust physician health care system contribute observed racial/ethnic difference diabetes outcome . Theoretical Framework : The conceptual theoretical framework study revise behavioral model health service use ( Andersen 1974 , 1968 , 1983 , 1995 ) . The model posit people 's use health service function predisposition use service , factor enable impede use , need care ( Andersen 1995 ) . Trust physicians health system fall health belief ( attitude toward health service ) , one predisposing factor think predict health service utilization health outcome . Thus , people high level trust physician health care system expect effective access , appropriate health utilization , good health outcome . The model revise include veteran-specific variable level service entitlement , period service , duration VA system , disability status measure health service use health outcome . Research Design Methods : This prospective cohort study five hypothesis organize specific aim follow : Specific Aim # 1 : Determine racial/ethnic difference trust physician mistrust health care system among veteran Type 2 Diabetes . Hypothesis # 1 : There difference mean score general trust physician scale ( GTIPS ) White Black American veteran Type 2 diabetes . Hypothesis # 2 : There difference mean score Health Care System Distrust Scale White Black American veteran Type 2 diabetes . Specific Aim # 2 : Determine predictive power trust physician mistrust health care system personal health practice health outcome prospective cohort veteran Type 2 Diabetes Hypothesis # 1 : Controlling predisposing , enable , need , veteran-specific factor , diabetic veteran low trust score higher mistrust score less likely keep office appointment , take prescribed medication , adhere diabetes self-management recommendation 12 month follow-up . Hypothesis # 2 : Controlling predisposing , enable , need , veteran-specific factor , diabetic veteran low trust score higher mistrust score high mean hemoglobin A1C , blood pressure , LDL cholesterol level 12 month follow-up . Hypothesis # 3 : Controlling predisposing , enable , need , veteran-specific factor , diabetic veteran low trust score higher mistrust score less likely accept influenza vaccination 12 month follow-up . Study site &amp; Subjects : Patients recruit Charleston VAMC . Equal number White Black American veteran age 18 year old Type 2 Diabetes recruit . Race/ethnicity base self-report . The diagnosis type 2 Diabetes well health utilization diabetes-specific health outcome obtain VA electronic medical record system ( CPRS ) . There approximately 6,961 patient Type 2 Diabetes site , 49.1 % ( 3,417 ) White Americans , 31.5 % ( 2,189 ) Black Americans , 19.4 % ( 1,355 ) Hispanic . Approximately 97.5 % men 90 % age 50 year old . Sample size calculation : Specific Aim # 1 : Sample Power V2.0 ( SPSS ) use sample size calculation base convention outline Cohen6 . Overall experiment wise error hold ? =0.05 , power 80 % use medium ( 0.25 ) effect size . Correction multiplicity test ( 2 test primary hypothesis ) involve use ? =0.025 ( 0.05/2 ) . This yield 125 patient per group . In addition , sample inflate account estimate 20 % attrition 1 year follow-up ( death , relocation , loss follow-up ) . No 150 eligible patient need enrol per group . Thus , 300 patient ( 150 Whites 150 African Americans ) recruit . Specific Aim # 2 : The sample size determination reliable regression equation offer Stevens7 15 subject per predictor variable . Using standard , sample size 300 , determine , would allow inclusion 20 predictor variable . Because none hypothesis Specific Aim 2 exceed 20 predictor variable , sample 300 adequate . Survey Instruments : The GTIPS4 valid reliable 11-item measure general trust physicians Health Care System Distrust Scale valid reliable 10-item measure mistrust health care system . Both instrument validate Black White Americans . Statistical Analysis Plan : Descriptive statistic use describe characteristic participant study . Specific Aim # 1 : Mean score trust mistrust scale baseline compare White Black Americans two-sample t-test similar comparison make control covariates ( predispose , enable , need , veteran-specific factor ) use Analysis Covariance ( ANCOVA ) . Specific Aim # 2 : Multiple linear regression use test effect mean trust/mistrust score health utilization mean hemoglobin A1C , blood pressure , LDL cholesterol 12 month follow-up control covariates . Similarly , multiple logistic regression use test effect trust/mistrust acceptance influenza vaccine control covariates . STATA V8.0 use data analysis test two-tailed overall p=0.05 hypothesis .</detailed_description>
