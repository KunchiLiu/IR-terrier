	<brief_summary>This study determine best use vaccine generate high level antibody call immune globulin ( IVIG ) people , , turn , collect use develop possible treatment avian influenza ( bird flu ) . Immune globulins protein make body attack influenza virus . This study use experimental bird flu vaccine stimulate immune globulin production healthy people . The vaccine similar regular influenza vaccine study 450 people . This study use high dos vaccine generate high antibody level collect produce new treatment . Healthy adults 18 60 year age weigh least 110 pound may eligible study . Candidates screen medical history physical examination . Participants give one three dos vaccine , depend enter study . The first 25 people enrol receive dose 90 microgram ( mcg ) . If dose well tolerate , next 25 people receive 120 mcg , dose also well tolerate , last 25 people receive 180 mcg . Vaccination consist either two shot ( one muscle arm ) one shot buttock four occasion . Subjects vaccinate four occasion , 4 week apart . On day vaccination , subject provide blood sample evaluate blood count , chemistry , antibody level , test HIV , hepatitis B C , syphilis , antibody avian flu . For 7 day vaccination , subject keep diary card record symptom , pain , fever , muscle ache , others . At end 7 day , contact study staff report symptom . In addition vaccination , subject undergo apheresis collect IVIG blood test show moderately high antibody level . For procedure , blood collect needle arm vein flow catheter ( plastic tube ) machine separate blood cell antibodies protein . The antibody protein collect rest blood return body . Subjects asked undergo least three apheresis procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Immune Globulin Treatment Avian Flu</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Avian influenza present threat future pandemic . Over 200 people infect influenza A H5N1 virus , mortality near 60 percent . Optimal therapy know , failure resistance currently available anti-virals report . The primary purpose Protocol determine optimal vaccination schedule create pool hyper immunize individual high titer anti-influenza A ( H5N1 ) antibody . The Protocol consist dose escalation study determine optimal vaccination dose number vaccination . There stop rule base number severity adverse event occur dos cohort . The optimal vaccination schedule determine could use large population develop high titer anti-influenza A ( H5N1 ) intravenous hyper-immune globulin ( IVIG ) . After vaccination occur , adequate antibody titer reach study population , subject begin apheresis . Each subject ask participate 3 apheresis session , may participate 10 apheresis session .</detailed_description>
