	<brief_summary>The primary aim randomize clinical trial compare effect misoprostol v extra amniotic saline infusion via catheter ( EASI ) cervical ripen proportion patient deliver cesarean section fetal intolerance labor versus vaginal delivery . The primary hypothesis patient undergoing cervical ripen EASI catheter less likely undergo cesarean section fetal intolerance labor compare woman receive misoprostol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ripening Interventions : Prostaglandins vs EASI Catheter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Induction labor common obstetrical practice . In fact , rate induction rise 184/1000 live birth . It well known favorable Bishop score , define Bishop score 5-8 , improve safety success rate induction labor vaginal delivery . Several method cervical ripening , mechanical pharmacological , develop improve Bishop score woman eligible induction labor unfavorable cervix . These method include : misoprostol , dinoprostone , intracervical catheter without extra-amniotic saline infusion , laminaria . Several study investigate optimum cervical ripening agent , review current literature support misoprostol give dose 25 microgram every 4 hour intravaginally efficacious inexpensive regimen maintain safe maternal fetal outcome . Several study show misoprostol significantly short time delivery compare method ripen . In fact , 2003 Cochrane Database Systematic Review , misoprostol show increased cervical ripening effectiveness reduce failure achieve vaginal delivery 12-24 hour . Further , uterine hyper-stimulation tachysystole common misoprostol group , adverse neonatal outcome describe . However , misoprostol show high incidence cesarean section fetal intolerance labor compare cervical ripen method include EASI . Several study support ideal route administration dosage misoprostol 25 microgram every 4 hour intravaginally . This regimen lead effective cervical ripen reduce dose-dependent effect misoprostol uterine tachysystole hyperstimulation . Another aspect consider cervical ripening method cost . Misoprostol much less expensive method include dinoprostone . In fact , one article report average cost per patient misoprostol treatment $ 85 compare $ 606 dinoprostone insert . Extra-amniotic saline infusion ( EASI ) introduce mechanical , non-pharmacological cervical ripening method . It involve placement Foley catheter cervix supplement continuous extra-amniotic infusion saline . This thought improve prostaglandin release , result shorten duration labor . Several study perform determine safety efficacy EASI method . Since misoprostol efficacious , safe , inexpensive , superior method cervical ripen act control experimental group undergo cervical ripen EASI catheter . Our hypothesis cervical ripen EASI method result few cesarean section fetal intolerance labor compare misoprostol . Furthermore , patient undergo cervical ripen EASI experience shorter time delivery , less expense , few adverse effect , satisfy EASI catheter misoprostol .</detailed_description>
