	<criteria>Adult adolescent subject either sex race , least 12 year age old , diagnosis asthma least 12 month ' duration , eligible enrollment . Subjects must meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion receive treatment assignment . Key Inclusion Criteria Include A subject must use medium daily dose inhale glucocorticosteroid ( ICS ) ( either alone combination longacting beta agonist ( LABA ) ) least 12 week must stable regimen ( daily dose unchanged ) least 2 week prior Screening . Medium daily dos ICS define follow : &gt; 500 1000 mcg beclomethasone chlorofluorocarbon ( CFC ) &gt; 250 500 mcg beclomethasone hydrofluoroalkane ( HFA ) &gt; 600 1000 mcg budesonide dry powder inhaler ( DPI ) &gt; 1000 2000 mcg flunisolide &gt; 250 500 mcg fluticasone 400 mcg MF &gt; 1000 2000 mcg triamcinolone acetonide Note : Dose delivery method modality note must equivalent . If , base upon medical judgment investigator , inherent harm change subject 's current asthma therapy , subject ( parent/guardian , applicable ) must willing discontinue his/her prescribed ICS ICS/LABA combination Screening Visit , transfer openlabel treatment MF MDI 200 mcg BID 2 3 week prior Baseline/Randomization Visit . To document diagnosis asthma assure subject 's responsiveness bronchodilator randomization one follow method use Screening Visit , Day 14 , thereafter , prior Baseline Visit : 1 . The subject must demonstrate increase absolute FEV1 least 12 % least 200 mL within 15 minute administration four inhalation albuterol/salbutamol ( total dose 360 400 mcg ) nebulized SABA ( 2.5 mg ) confirm standard office practice , OR 2 . The subject must demonstrate peak expiratory flow ( PEF ) variability 20 % express percentage high low morning prebronchodilator PEF least 1 week , OR 3 . The subject must demonstrate diurnal variation PEF 20 % base difference prebronchodilator morning value postbronchodilator value evening , express percentage mean daily PEF value . At Screening Visit , subject 's FEV1 must ≥60 % ≤90 % predict . At Baseline Visit , subject 's FEV1 must ≥60 % ≤85 % predict restricted medication withhold appropriate interval . Clinical laboratory test ( complete blood count [ CBC ] , blood chemistry , urinalysis ) conduct Screening Visit must within normal limit clinically acceptable investigator/sponsor . An electrocardiogram ( ECG ) use centralize transtelephonic technology Screening Visit must clinically acceptable investigator . A chest xray perform Screening Visit , within 12 month prior Screening Visit , must clinically acceptable investigator . A female subject childbearing potential must use medically acceptable , adequate form birth control . This include : 1 ) hormonal contraceptive prescribe physician ( oral combine , hormonal implant ) ; 2 ) medically prescribe intrauterine device ( IUD ) ; 3 ) condom combination spermicide ( double barrier method ) ; 4 ) monogamous relationship male partner vasectomy . The subject must start birth control method least 3 month prior Screening ( exception condom combination spermicide ) , must agree continue use duration study . A female subject childbearing potential currently sexually active must agree consent use medically acceptable birth control method become sexually active course study . Women surgically sterilize least 1 year postmenopausal consider childbearing potential . A female subject childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test Screening order consider eligible enrollment . Key Exclusion Criteria Include A subject demonstrate change ( increase decrease ) absolute FEV1 &gt; 20 % time Screening Visit include Baseline Visit . A subject require use great eight inhalation per day SABA MDI , two nebulized treatment per day 2.5 mg SABA , 2 consecutive day Screening Visit include Baseline Visit . A subject experience decrease AM PM PEF Screening Period stability limit 2 consecutive day prior Randomization . A subject experience occurrence clinical deterioration asthma result emergency treatment , hospitalization due asthma , treatment additional , exclude asthma medication ( SABA ) judge clinical investigator time Screening Visit include Baseline Visit . A subject smoker exsmoker smoke within previous year cumulative smoking history &gt; 10 packyears</criteria>
