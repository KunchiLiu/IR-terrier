	<brief_summary>Prevention progressive renal disease need clear understanding prevalence early stage chronic kidney disease community . Even developed country subject early stage chronic kidney disease go largely undiagnosed untreated . Targeted screening could identify great number individual risk general public screening ( 11 ) . It economically feasible perform country like Pakistan . Hypertension diabetes highly prevalent South-Asia.It anticipate target screen hypertensive population perform especially age group intervention might expect maximal benefit help identify large number patient essential hypertension destine develop course advance towards end stage renal disease also unearth mislabeled “ essential hypertension ” underlie primary renal disease . This late group may belong socio-economic disadvantage population limit access health care never investigate properly . The aim Study detect sub-clinical chronic kidney disease hypertensive patient community level identify associate risk factor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prevalence Chronic KIdney Disease Hypertensive Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Cross sectional prevalent study target diagnose hypertensive age 40 year , middle low socio-economic setting Karachi . This propose study nest exist Wellcome Trust fund study . The parent study design determine impact unique community versus high risk approach control BP Karachi , Pakistan In ongoing Factorial design , individual age ≥40 find hypertensive 12 cluster ( contain 250 household ) randomize different intervention BP control . All participant enrol study urine examination proteinuria serum creatinine measurement baseline assess renal status . For propose study identify hypertensive ( parent study ) either show proteinuria elevate serum creatinine ( 1.2 female 1.4 mg/dl male ) baseline approach . Serum creatinine level exceed mention cut-off level , reach GFR &lt; 60ml/min/m² . As mentioned order classify subject chronic kidney disease abnormality must demonstrate persist least three month . A repeat serum creatinine measurement urine examination proteinuria perform present study , obtain blood sample urine sample respectively subject . As period three month already pass since baseline investigation do , subject show persistent abnormality either test fall chronic kidney disease group . The repeated testing confirm presence CKD include , measurement serum creatinine urinary albumin/creatinine ratio ( &gt; 30mg/g ) untimed urine specimen . This method recommend preferred screening strategy . A set questionnaire fill interviewing patient risk factor presence renal disease analyze base information . The data collection do structured questionnaire diagnosis make basis persistently elevate kidney biomarkers .</detailed_description>
