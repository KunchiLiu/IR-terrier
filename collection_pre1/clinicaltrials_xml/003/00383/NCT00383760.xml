	<brief_title>Eribulin Mesylate Second-Line Therapy Locally Advanced , Unresectable , Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : I . To determine objective response ( complete partial ) E7389 patient locally advance , unresectable , metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma progress prior gemcitabine hydrochloride-based therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVE : I . To determine antitumor activity E7389 , term median survival , 1-year survival rate , response stable disease duration , toxicity , time disease progression , patient . OUTLINE : This open-label , multicenter study . Patients receive eribulin mesylate IV day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week . Patients complete response , partial response , stable disease follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
