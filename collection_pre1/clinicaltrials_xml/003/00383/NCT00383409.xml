	<brief_summary>Multivitamins ( MVi ) broadly use cancer patient improve overall health energy . Fatigue common symptom cancer patient include receive radiation therapy . We conduct trial MVi versus placebo patient breast cancer ( BC ) undergo radiation therapy ( Rxt ) evaluate MVi would affect fatigue quality life . We randomize patient begin Rxt treatment either placebo Centrum Silver® ( Wyeth-Whitehall laboratory ) . At middle radiation treatment patient switch placebo MVi vice versa . Patients answer EORTC QLQ C-30 quality life ( QOL ) Chalder Fatigue Questionnaires begin , time switch end Rxt . We find group experience significant decrease general physical fatigue end course placebo compare assessment prior treatment . We also observe significant improvement functional symptom patient placebo . When compare different group patient also observe significantly low rate physical general fatigue patient finish course placebo compare patient finish course MVi . We conclude MVi improve radiation relate fatigue , may fact deleterious effect fatigue decrease QOL patient BC undergo Rxt .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Multivitamins ( MVi ) broadly use cancer patient improve overall health energy . Fatigue common symptom cancer patient include receive radiation therapy . We conduct double blind randomized cross-over trial MVi versus placebo patient breast cancer ( BC ) undergo radiation therapy ( Rxt ) evaluate MVi would affect fatigue quality life . We randomize forty patient begin Rxt treatment either placebo Centrum Silver® ( Wyeth-Whitehall laboratory ) . At middle radiation treatment patient switch placebo MVi vice versa . Patients answer EORTC QLQ C-30 quality life ( QOL ) Chalder Fatigue Questionnaires begin , time switch end Rxt . When analyzed group patient throughout treatment period , find group experience significant decrease general ( p = 0.009 ; p = 0.001 ) physical fatigue score ( p = 0.031 ; p = 0.029 ) end course placebo compare assessment prior treatment . We also observe significant improvement functional ( p = 0.026 ) symptom ( p = 0.016 ) score scale QOL questionnaire patient placebo . No significant change elicit use MVi . When compare different group patient also observe significantly low rate physical general fatigue patient finish course placebo compare patient finish course MVi ( 0 vs 25 % p = 0.035 type fatigue ) . We conclude MVi improve radiation relate fatigue , may fact deleterious effect fatigue decrease QOL patient BC undergo Rxt . Further study need confirm finding .</detailed_description>
