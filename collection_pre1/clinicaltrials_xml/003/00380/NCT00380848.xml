	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether hemodiafiltration , new form hemodialysis improve sleep apnea patient end stage kidney disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Different Dialysis Sleep Apnea Patients With Renal Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleep apnea breathe problem sleep frequent , occur 6 % general population . However , half patient dialysis suffer breathe problem related sleep . Sleep apnea associate high blood pressure , excessive sleepiness , fatigue , poor memory concentration well depression normal kidney . Hemodiafiltration new kind dialysis efficient clear toxin accumulate kidney failure . It use successfully Europe 15 year . However , effect hemodiafiltration sleep apnea dialysis patient never assess . We conduct clinical trial examine effect hemodiafiltration sleep apnea dialysis patient . Fifteen patient sleep apnea , already dialysis treat hemodiafiltration 3 time week , instead regular hemodialysis treatment period 3 month . We repeat sleep study patient hemodiafiltration period ass quality life . We hope decrease severity sleep apnea hemodiafiltration . This could result good sleep , improve energy level , mood , memory , concentration blood pressure control afflict sleep apnea dialysis . Our finding would also give u good insight cause sleep apnea patient end stage kidney disease .</detailed_description>
