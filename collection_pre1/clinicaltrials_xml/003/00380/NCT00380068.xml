	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Ambrisentan Subjects With Pulmonary Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study enroll 200 participant PH due follow etiology : 1 ) PAH include idiopathic familial PAH PAH associate collagen vascular disease , congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunt ( include Eisenmenger 's syndrome ) , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , drug toxin , thyroid disorder , glycogen storage disease , Gaucher disease , hemoglobinopathy , splenectomy ( WHO Group 1 ) ; 2 ) PH associate lung disease and/or hypoxemia , include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) , sleep-disordered breathing , alveolar hypoventilation disorder ( WHO Group 3 ) ; 3 ) PH due proximal distal chronic thromboembolic obstruction ( WHO Group 4 ) ; 4 ) PH due sarcoidosis ( WHO Group 5 ) . Participants leave heart disease leave heart failure exclude ( WHO Group 2 ) . Participants could receive prostacyclin sildenafil therapy baseline , participant previously discontinue either bosentan , sitaxsentan , , due liver function test abnormality eligible .</detailed_description>
