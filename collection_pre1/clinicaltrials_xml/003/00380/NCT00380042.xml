	<brief_title>Assessment Safety Effectiveness Cortical Stimulation Subjects With Major Depressive Disorder</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major depressive disorder common psychiatric disorder . The World Health Organization estimate 340 million people worldwide suffer episode major depression year , account 4.4 % overall global disease burden . In United States , 9.5 % 19 million people affected depressive disorder , lifetime risk 17 % major depressive disorder . While depression effectively treat majority patient medication psychotherapy , 20 % patient fail respond . Electroconvulsive Therapy ( ECT ) effective approximately 70 % case antidepressant medication provide sufficient relief symptom . However , many 20-50 % people respond well course ECT relapse within 6 month , therefore , periodic maintenance therapy often require . For patient resistant therapy note , invasive approach use , include Vagus Nerve Stimulation ( VNS ) recently Deep Brain Stimulation ( DBS ) . Direct cortical stimulation cortex via implant device system may provide long lasting benefit minimal side effect . The current study seek assess feasibility study safety efficacy stimulate prefrontal cortex patient major depressive disorder .</detailed_description>
