	<brief_summary>Prospective control randomized clinical trial . Consecutive patient acute proximal deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) low extremity , without contemporary manifestation pulmonary embolism , randomize receive either fixed duration anticoagulant therapy ( three month patient DVT secondary transitory risk factor , six month patient idiopathic DVT ) flexible duration anticoagulant therapy , accord persistence residual thrombus , show leg vein ultrasonography ( 1 year patient secondary DVT , 2 year idiopathic DVT ) . All patient follow three year assess development ( objectively document ) recurrent thromboembolism . The rate recurrent thromboembolism compare two study group , well rate major bleed complication occur anticoagulation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study patient Consecutive patient symptomatic proximal-vein thrombosis complete three month anticoagulation eligible study . Patients thrombosis occur association recent ( less three month ) trauma , surgical intervention puerperium , prolong ( seven day ) immobilization cause use hormonal treatment regard `` secondary thrombosis '' . All patient define idiopathic thrombosis . Study design interventions The AESOPUS study randomize , multicenter , open trial , independent blind assessment study outcome . The study design evaluate long-term clinical benefit risk adjust duration oral anticoagulant therapy base persistence recanalization venous thrombosis , show repeated ultrasonography . Randomization stratify secondary versus idiopathic thrombosis center . After complete first uneventful three month anticoagulation , patient randomize fixed duration warfarin flexible duration . In fixed duration group , patient idiopathic deep-vein thrombosis receive 3 additional month treatment ( total treatment duration 6 month ) , patient secondary deep-vein thrombosis discontinue treatment ( total treatment duration 3 month ) . In flexible duration group , patient ultrasound time randomization 3 , 9 , 15 21 month index event idiopathic 3 9 month index event secondary . Anticoagulant therapy discontinue thrombosis recanalized . If residual venous thrombosis detect , treatment continue follow ultrasound test , maximum 9 month secondary 21 month idiopathic venous thrombosis . In group , warfarin adjust target international normalized ratio 2.0 3.0 . Ultrasound assessment common femoral popliteal vein ( transverse plane ) do accord standardized procedure independent expert unaware clinical detail previous ultrasound finding . Vein diameter measure maximal compression , consider recanalized case diameter &lt; 2.0 millimeter single determination , diameter &lt; 3.0 millimeter two consecutive determination . Follow-up , recurrent VTE bleeding Patients followed-up 33 month document incidence symptomatic recurrent thromboembolism . Follow-up visit schedule patient 3 , 9 , 15 , 21 , 33 month randomization . Recurrent thromboembolism diagnose compression ultrasound , ventilation/perfusion scanning , helical tomography appropriate . If recurrent thrombosis suspect previously unaffected leg , sole diagnostic criterion incompressibility proximal vein . Ultrasound criterion recurrent ipsilateral thrombosis incompressibility proximal vein segment initially free thrombus and/or incompressibility proximal vein completely recanalized . Nonfatal pulmonary embolism define ( sub ) segmental ventilation-perfusion mismatch lung scan intraluminal filling defect spiral compute tomography chest . Fatal pulmonary embolism diagnose confirm autopsy , antecede immediate period death objectively confirm pulmonary embolism venous thrombosis , sudden death explain disease condition pulmonary embolism . Bleeding define major clinically overt associated hemoglobin drop least 20 g/L transfusion al least two unit red cell , retroperitoneal intracranial . All outcome event review independent adjudication committee whose member unaware treatment assign .</detailed_description>
