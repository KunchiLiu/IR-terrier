	<detailed_description>Pregnancy increase risk malaria progression complication 10-fold increase malaria case fatality rate area low transmission . Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( SP ) use widely Africa systematic intermittent presumptive , preventive , treatment ( IPTp ) second third trimester pregnancy national program IPTp SP implement recently Mozambique . There evidence kinetics several antimalarial drug alter pregnancy extent dose adequate pregnancy , however publish study include pharmacokinetic component confirm standard dose SP optimal vulnerable patient group . This study therefore create opportunity study whether pharmacokinetic property SP alter physiological change occur pregnancy .</detailed_description>
