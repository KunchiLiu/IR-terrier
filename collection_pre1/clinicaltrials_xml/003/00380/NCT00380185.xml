	<detailed_description>Plaque build-up cause atherosclerosis increase risk blood clot , heart attack , stroke . Blockages plaque occur different area body . PAD , circulatory disorder blockage occur peripheral artery , one manifestation atherosclerosis . Individuals PAD experience reduce blood flow leg , may cause leg pain walking . Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , plaque build artery lead heart , another atherosclerosis-related condition . Individuals PAD CAD similar atherosclerosis risk factor , remain unknown individual develop one disease . Genetic difference may influence atherosclerosis develops . The goal study identify genetic variation may cause inherited difference plaque distribution . This study enroll individual PAD refer doctor coronary angiogram confirm presence CAD . A control group compose individual PAD , similar risk factor atherosclerosis , also enrol . All participant attend one study visit . They undergo coronary angiogram , procedure special dye insert intravenously artery heart . X-rays take document blood flow artery . Questionnaires assess quality life , exercise habit , tobacco exposure , family medical history complete . Participants also undergo blood pressure measurement blood collection genetic analysis . Yearly follow-up phone call occur 5 year document hospitalization .</detailed_description>
