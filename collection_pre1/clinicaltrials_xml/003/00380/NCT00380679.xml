	<brief_summary>According Advisory Committee Immunization Practices ( ACIP ) , people age 50 year old person age less 50 year medical condition put increase risk serious influenza disease receive annual influenza vaccination . However , since mid-1990s , vaccination rate racial disparity mostly remain static , limited progress towards Healthy People 2010 objectives influenza vaccination coverage . The purpose study determine proportion previously unvaccinated person target group influenza pneumococcal vaccine recommend accept receive influenza and/or pneumococcal vaccine urban emergency department ( ED ) , estimate potential impact ED vaccination population-based vaccination coverage . The intervention utilize combination assessment survey , vaccine information pre-printed vaccine order sheet . The target population influenza vaccination include patient age 18 year old influenza vaccine recommend ACIP . This include person age 50 year old person age 18 49 year one follow group : 1 ) health care worker , 2 ) pregnant woman , 3 ) resident long-term care facility , 4 ) household contact out-of-home caregiver child age 0 23 month , 5 ) person underlie chronic medical condition increase risk influenza-related complication . The target population pneumococcal vaccination include patient age 65 year old previously vaccinate pneumococcus receive vaccine within 5 year ( less 65 year time vaccination ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PROTOCOL - Baton Rouge General Medical Center Background According Institute Medicine , non-institutionalized high-risk adult may present great challenge adult immunization . There number barrier implementation comprehensive strategy vaccinate adult : - Routine preventive health visit infrequent transient - Individuals lack knowledge vaccine require adulthood - Primary care provider may lack time , knowledge , ability perform vaccination assessment , may part standard practice pattern - Primary care provider lack infrastructure ( especially time personnel ) assist adequately assess document immunization status Emergency department represent ideal setting vaccination effort year million adults limited access traditional primary care visit hospital EDs medical surgical problem non-life threaten . Such EDs often already provide medical screen preventive care service management patient . Almost one-quarter adult age 65 year old make one visit emergency department year . Patients use EDs usual source care likely member minority group uninsured . These characteristic suggest vaccination program EDs could significant impact correct disparity vaccination coverage among patient old age group . Combined large volume patient visit day , characteristic would seem make EDs ideal setting implement vaccination service people little access primary care . Furthermore , influenza vaccination EDs could play substantial role correct disparity vaccination coverage among cohort patient . The American College Emergency Physicians recommend ED personnel consider participate influenza vaccine program elderly source vaccination readily available . A limited number study suggest half patient influenza vaccine indicate ( base age high risk condition ) yet receive influenza vaccination current season would accept vaccination offer ED visit . However , since study conduct early vaccination season involve use convenience sample , result might generalizable patient see ED throughout vaccination season . The proportion person would vaccinate elsewhere would accept vaccination EDs demonstrate . Therefore , true potential vaccination EDs increase vaccination coverage unknown . Additional evidence suggest strong recommendation health care professional , particularly patient ’ primary physician , increase acceptance influenza vaccine . However , limited evidence regard effectiveness counseling provider previously unknown patient , usually case ED setting , produce similar change patient behavior . Goals Objectives The overall goal determine feasibility , sustainability , acceptability , effectiveness hospital-based vaccination effort increase influenza immunization coverage among person age 18 year old vaccination recommend would otherwise vaccinate . Inherent feasibility sustainability ability recoup income vaccinate . Objective For patient age 18 year old seek medical care ED , determine 1. number vaccination administer eligible person 2. proportion patient , among person previously vaccinate , accept vaccine emergency department . 3. increase coverage achieve four-month emergency department-based vaccination program Study design method 1 . All patient age 18 year old approach PPS chief complaint ascertain . The PPS begin administer questionnaire eligible patient vaccine recommend . If patient eligible , PPS read questionnaire patient . 2 . If patient unsure state want receive flu vaccine , PPS determine reason vaccine refusal . If patient meet criteria influenza vaccination and/or pneumococcal vaccination , PPS inform him/her influenza/pneumococcal vaccine is/are recommend vaccination offer eligible patient ED additional charge beyond reimbursed insurance . Patients refer physician additional assessment questionable possible contraindication . The PPS provide eligible patient appropriate Vaccine Information Statement ( ) answer question . If patient agrees vaccinate , PPS place preprinted order form patient ’ chart , ask physician sign order , alert patient ’ nurse . The patient offer vaccination ED nurse undergo evaluation treatment emergency room . The nurse give vaccination document lot number , expiration date , time location injection ( ) label place patient ’ chart . Documentation dose receive faxed patient ’ private care physician , information available . How confidentiality maintain : Personal identifier retain investigator beyond time need document dose receipt patient medical record . Exclusion criterion : All patient 18 year age exclude . Any patient medically unstable condition , alter mental status , language barrier also exclude . Patients present contraindication influenza vaccination ( acute febrile illness history allergic reaction egg ) pneumococcal vaccine eligible receipt vaccine . Immunization status : Previous immunization history assess patient self-report . Data analysis : The primary outcome measure number indicate influenza pneumococcal vaccination receive course study . Data collect analyzed accord demographic information , contraindication , clinical consent . PROTOCOL - Our Lady Lake Regional Medical Center Goals Objectives : The overall goal determine feasibility , sustainability , acceptability , effectiveness hospital-based vaccination effort increase influenza immunization coverage among person age 50 year old would otherwise vaccinate . Inherent feasibility sustainability ability recoup income vaccinate . Objective For patient age 50 year old seek medical care ED , determine 1. number vaccination administer 2. proportion patient , among person previously vaccinate , accept vaccine emergency department . 3. increase coverage achieve four-month emergency department-based vaccination program 4. information incentive might convince initially reluctant patient accept influenza vaccine Study design method 1 . All patient age 50 year old approach scribe chief complaint ascertain . The scribe begin administer questionnaire age eligible patient . Having already take history , scribe able easily determine patient eligible study ( i.e . meet exclusion criterion ) . If patient eligible , scribe read questionnaire patient . 2 . If patient unsure state want vaccinate , scribe determine reason . If patient meet criteria vaccination ( i.e. , previously vaccinate influenza season know contraindication influenza vaccination ) , scribe inform him/her influenza vaccine recommend vaccine offer eligible patient ED additional charge beyond reimbursed insurance . Patients refer physician additional assessment questionable possible contraindication . The scribe provide eligible patient VIS answer question . If patient agrees vaccinate , scribe place preprinted label patient ’ chart , ask physician sign order , alert patient ’ nurse . The patient offer vaccination ED nurse undergo evaluation treatment emergency room . The nurse give vaccination document lot number , expiration date , time location injection label place patient ’ chart . How confidentiality maintain : Personal identifier retain investigator beyond time need document dose receipt patient medical record . Exclusion criterion : All patient 50 year age exclude . Any patient medically unstable condition , alter mental status , language barrier also exclude . Patients present contraindication influenza vaccination ( acute febrile illness history allergic reaction egg ) previous influenza vaccine exclude . Immunization status : Previous immunization history assess patient self-report . Data analysis : The primary outcome measure number indicate influenza vaccination receive course study . Data collect analyzed accord demographic information , contraindication , clinical consent . Secondary analysis effectiveness system change deliver vaccine emergency department setting . If necessary , survey administer key staff person assist data gathering analysis .</detailed_description>
