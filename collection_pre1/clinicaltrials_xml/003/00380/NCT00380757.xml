	<brief_summary>STUDY OBJECTIVES The overall goal study compare bystander fatigue CPR quality 5 minute new 30:2 versus old 15:2 chest compression ventilation International Resuscitation Guidelines , population age 55 great . More specifically , compare CPR ratio regard : 1 . The achieved frequency depth chest compression , 2 . Participant rating perceive level exertion , 3 . Resulting serum lactate level subset participant . STUDY HYPOTHESIS In population age 55 great , new 30:2 CPR ratio lead : 1. le frequent shallower chest compression 5-minute study period ; 2. high rating perceive level exertion ; 3. high serum lactate level subset participant compare old 15:2 CPR ratio .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Bystander Fatigue CPR Quality When Using Two Different CPR Ratios .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Cardiac arrest number one cause mortality Canadian population . Out-of-hospital bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) associate 3 4 fold increase survival cardiac arrest . Any interruption delivery chest compression cardiac arrest victim detrimental survival . In effort minimize interruption chest compression , new International Guidelines change long-recommended 15:2 compression ventilation ratio 30:2 . Although 30:2 ratio meant increase survival cardiac arrest , ability rescuer deliver new CPR ratio intervention never study . Little known potential impact new recommendation bystander fatigue result CPR quality . Objectives : The overall goal study compare bystander fatigue CPR quality 5 minute new 30:2 versus old 15:2 chest compression ventilation International Guidelines population age 55 great . More specifically , compare CPR ratio regard : 1 . The achieved frequency depth chest compression , 2 . Participant rating perceive level exertion , 3 . Resulting serum lactate level subset participant . Methods : We conduct randomize cross-over trial compare bystander fatigue CPR quality use two different CPR ratio . Intervention : All participant ask perform two 5-minute session CPR record manikin - one session use 30:2 ratio , use 15:2 ratio . There supervised practice session beginning , rest period . The order session execute determined random fashion . The study population consist volunteer age 55 old , group susceptible perform CPR real victim . The study take place busy public area The Ottawa Hospital , Civic Campus , cafeteria emergency department . Participants score 3 less validated Clinical Frailty Scale order participate study . Participants physical limitation disease process preclude ability safely perform CPR exclude . Outcome measure : Information age , gender , height , weight , prior CPR training , measure frailty collect time enrollment . The number , frequency , quality chest compression ( depth release ) measure CPR session use record ResusciAnne manikin . Heart rate blood pressure measure CPR session . The participant ask rate level fatigue CPR session use validated Borg Rating Perceived Exertion scale . In addition , serum lactate level determine CPR session volunteer second group . Sample size : We hope recruit 42 participant , among 10 lactate level measure . Data analysis Objective # 1 # 3 include descriptive statistic pair t-test 95 % confidence interval ; Objective # 2 analyzed use descriptive statistic WIlcoxon Rank Sum test . In addition , perform stepwise logistic regression analysis control potential confounding effect variable otherwise associate bystander fatigue CPR performance use CPR ratio . This study protocol receive ascent form OHREB implementation , enter OHRI randomize trial registry . Importance study Data study evaluate bystander fatigue result CPR quality compare new 30:2 old 15:2 International Guidelines . This highly innovative project improve understanding physiological demand associate implementation new CPR International Guidelines . We anticipate result study widely distribute , help shape next iteration International Resuscitation Guidelines .</detailed_description>
