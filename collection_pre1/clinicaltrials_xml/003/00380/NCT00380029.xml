	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Erlotinib may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving erlotinib surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving erlotinib surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery . PURPOSE : This phase II trial study well erlotinib work give surgery treat patient muscle-invasive bladder cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary - Determine effect neoadjuvant erlotinib hydrochloride histopathological , molecular , genetic correlate patient undergo radical cystectomy muscle-invasive bladder cancer . Secondary - Determine pathological complete response rate surgical specimens patient treated drug . - Determine recurrence progression rate cystectomy ( 2 year surgery ) patient treat neoadjuvant adjuvant erlotinib hydrochloride . - Determine 2- 5-year disease-free , disease-specific , overall survival rate patient treated drug . - Determine safety drug patient . OUTLINE : This open-label study . Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily 4 week . Patients undergo radical cystectomy curative intent . Within 12 week surgery , patient resume oral erlotinib hydrochloride* daily 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . NOTE : *Patients candidate adjuvant chemotherapy ( e.g. , find pT3 , N+ disease ) receive erlotinib hydrochloride surgery . Tumor tissue obtain baseline ( original confirmatory transurethral resection bladder tumor ) time cystectomy analysis drug-specific tissue-based biomarkers western blot , immunohistochemistry , gene array technique . Histopathological , molecular , genetic correlate analyze well understand potential effect EGFR inhibition transitional cell carcinoma determine effect neoadjuvant erlotinib gene expression . Tumor tissue also evaluate real-time polymerase chain reaction confirm drug effect expect target EGFR expression , activity , affect signal pathway disease state microarray analysis define expression phenotype correlate outcome , distinguish responder nonresponders , determine effect drug treatment gene expression disease . Patients follow periodically 5 year surgery .</detailed_description>
