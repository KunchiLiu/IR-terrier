	<brief_title>A Comparison Advanced Metal Hip System Resurfacing Hip System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A standard hip replacement involve replace hip joint several part : cup form socket pelvis ; head form new ball top thigh bone ; stem place thigh bone . Typically , socket make metal plastic , ball stem make metal . Recently , new metal-on-metal hip replacement system develop socket shell make metal . This cause metal ion release body . The CONSERVE® A-Class Total Hip BFH technology new metal-on-metal total hip system utilizes large diameter femoral head ( 36-54 mm ) similar size original head ( i.e. , original bone ) . Further , system utilizes advanced metal design wear slow rate typical metal-on-metal implant . Therefore , primary purpose current study investigate CONSERVE® A-Class Total Hip BFH technology lead lower blood ion level patient , compare patient recent study receive CONSERVE® Plus Total Resurfacing Hip System , another metal-on-metal device . We also compare functional radiographic ( x-rays ) outcomes patient receive CONSERVE® A-Class Total Hip compare receive CONSERVE® Plus Total Resurfacing Hip System .</detailed_description>
