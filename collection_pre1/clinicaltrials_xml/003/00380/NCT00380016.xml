	<brief_summary>This study offer catheter-based treatment heart artery disease . This protocol permit treatment patient cardiovascular disease may eligible participate current research protocol . The treatment offer protocol experimental , rather standard treatment provide large referral hospital United States . Patients 18 year age old candidate catheter-based treatment obstructive artery disease , include block blood flow coronary artery ( artery heart ) artery arm , leg , brain kidney may eligible study . Candidates screen general medical evaluation may include blood test , magnetic resonance imaging , monitor heart rate rhythm . Participants undergo angioplasty stenting blockage artery heart artery arm , leg , brain kidney . The procedure use balloon-tipped catheter open block artery likely require permanent implantation metal tube ( stent ) improve blood flow vessel . During procedure , patient give sedative pain medication , need .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The NHLBI develop novel minimally invasive catheter-based treatment cardiovascular disease . These investigational treatment require physician , nurse technical staff maintain expand technical skill conduct conventional catheter-based treatment . This protocol permit treatment patient cardiovascular disease necessarily eligible participate exist clinical research protocol , medical interest purpose train professional staff , may eligible adjunctive investigational image clinical treatment . Efforts make offer treatment patient limited financial resource limit access specialty health care . This protocol also provide mechanism offer catheter-based treatment cardiovascular disease patient , may participate technical development protocol cardiovascular intervention cardiovascular imaging .</detailed_description>
