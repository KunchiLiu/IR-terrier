	<brief_title>A Long-term Safety Study Infliximab Patients With Moderate Severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design collect long-term safety information infliximab , patient COPD participate research study use drug . The primary COPD study include C0168T54 ( U.S. ) two small study Europe ( EU0016 C0168X09 EU0073 C0168X57 ) . All patient least one dose study drug study ask participate long-term safety follow-up study provide important information study drug . The long-term effect study drug new cancer survival evaluate data collect 5-year period begin patient 's last safety visit primary study . Data study collect study entry twice yearly thereafter maximum 5 year patient 's last safety visit primary study . The last safety visit primary study define last visit subject adverse event ( AEs ) record primary study.Twice yearly , participate study site remind complete electronic chart participate patient . At study entry , follow perform : ( 1 ) Medical history physical examination , include ear , nose , throat ( ENT ) examination perform qualified physician ; ( 2 ) Chest x-ray ( posterior lateral ) , unless perform within 3 month prior enrollment ( 3 ) CT ( computer image ) scan chest ( spiral prefer ) , unless perform within 6 month prior enrollment . In addition , data collect study entry use commercial infliximab anti-tumor necrosis factor ( anti-TNF ) agent subsequent last safety visit primary study . At patient 's subsequent visit , data collect either direct contact patient ( office visit telephone call ) , review patient 's medical record , contact patient 's primary care physician oncologist . At final visit ( 5 year patient 's last safety visit primary study ) , follow perform : ( 1 ) Medical history physical examination , include ENT examination perform qualified physician ; ( 2 ) Chest x-ray , unless perform within previous 3 month , ( 3 ) CT scan chest ( spiral prefer ) , unless perform within previous 6 month . The primary outcome study Number patient follow safety event : malignancy death . The secondary outcome study number patient malignancy malignancy type ( ie , Hodgkin 's lymphoma , non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , head neck cancer , lung cancer , malignancy ) .
