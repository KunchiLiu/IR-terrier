	<brief_title>Effects Instrument-Applied Spinal Manipulative Therapy Postureal Control Autonomic Balance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previous study demonstrate sensory cognitive system share common neural substrate . The afferent neural impuleses mechanoreception ( also know somatosensation ) produce joint mechanoreceptors adjacent muscle spindle cell may impact supraspinal center . Few study do determine afferent impulse generate spinal manipulative therapy ( SMT ) impact porcessing occur supra-spinal center . The relationship postural control cognition study use dual-tak methodology , primary ( postural ) task often demonstrate degradation addition secondary , concurrent ( cognitive ) task . The current study seek determine effect SMT postrual control use dual-task paradigm , monitor autonomic state ( use Heart Rate Variability analysis ) course therapy . It think SMT improve HRV status , postural control within dual-task situation , differences postural control relate participant 's HRV status . Activities daily live often invole couple cognitive task complex postural task .</detailed_description>
