	<detailed_description>Background : Esophageal carcinoma aggressive disease poor prognosis . Surgical resection radical lymphadenectomy remain basic method management malignancy . The international Society Diseases Esophagus classify extent lymphadenectomy standard , extend , total , three-field lymphadenectomy . However , lymph node metastasis present regional metastasis , skip metastasis distant metastasis , optimal extent lymphadenectomy remain controversial . Three-filed lymphadenectomy criticize high surgical risk , merit remove potential positive node reduce local recurrence . The purpose study conduct large scale prospective randomize Phase â…¢ clinical trial test base long-term outcome ( overall survival disease free survival ) postoperative short-term outcome ( mortality , morbidity ) , whether one extent lymphadenectomy superior approach . Objectives : 1 . To compare overall survival three-field lymphadenectomy two-field lymphadenectomy 2 . To compare locoregional recurrence , disease free survival three-field lymphadenectomy two-field lymphadenectomy 3 . To compare postoperative morbidity mortality two group 4 . To evaluate short long term quality life two procedure Design : Prospective randomized control Setting : Fudan University Cancer Center , Shanghai , China . Patients method : All patient biopsy proven carcinoma middle low third esophagus present hospital consider study . Staging investigation standard include 1 . Computed Tomography ( CT ) scan patient 2 . Esophagogastroscopy 3 . Barium swallow 4 . Endoscopic Ultrasonography ( EUS ) wherever possible 5 . PET-CT scan wherever possible Randomization : Block randomization do use computer generate sheet . Randomization perform 3 day 1 week operation . All surgery perform general anesthesia epidural analgesia . The surgery either perform direct supervision consultant thoracic surgeon experience esophageal surgery . Operative time , blood loss , blood product replacement intraoperative detail record proforma . Patients shift postoperatively intensive care unit ( ICU ) observation subsequently recovery high dependency ward stabilize . Postoperative detail include period postoperative ventilation , hemorrhage , pulmonary cardiac complication , arrhythmia , thoracic duct leak , anastomotic leak , wound infection recurrent laryngeal nerve paresis palsy record . Postoperative mortality define 30-day mortality plus death discharge surgery . The total duration ICU stay hospital stay also record . Follow : Patients follow three monthly first two year six monthly third fifth year annually thereafter . A detailed history clinical examination CT scan , barium swallow ultrasound do routinely every follow . Data management : All collect data enter statistical software package subsequent analysis Main research variable : Primary end point : Disease free survival two arm Secondary endpoint : 1 . Overall survival 2 . Locoregional recurrence 3 . Postoperative morbidity mortality 4 . Quality life : assessed EORTC QLQ-C30 scale EORTC QLQ- OES18 scale .</detailed_description>
