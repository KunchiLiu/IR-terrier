	<detailed_description>The goal study two fold : 1 ) To evaluate impact personalize patient health goal education reminder tool patient adherence evidence base therapy subsequent cardiovascular risk factor modification acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) ; 2 ) To assess age-related heterogeneity antiplatelet response among AMI patient . This prospective study ~220 AMI patient , least half age 65 year . Patients survey questionnaire ( baseline 6 month post discharge ) biomarkers ( baseline ) ass status physical function , depression , nutrition , inflammation , response antiplatelet therapy . Patients also administer walk test grip strength test baseline . About 1 week hospital discharge , 3 month hospital discharge , half patient outpatient provider receive personalize post-AMI health goal education reminder tool patient adherence evidence-based secondary prevention therapy . Data analyze aggregate use descriptive statistic . The primary endpoint interest composite measure adherence six month secondary prevention therapy describe sum measure receive divided sum available opportunity . The secondary endpoint analyze describe platelet response profile function age . The study team anticipate risk study minimal , since patient receive investigational therapy .</detailed_description>
