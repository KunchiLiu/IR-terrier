	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well give sipuleucel-T without radiation therapy work treat patient hormone-resistant metastatic prostate cancer . Vaccines may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . Radiation therapy use high energy x ray kill tumor cell . It yet know whether give sipuleucel-T vaccine effective without radiation therapy treat prostate cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sipuleucel-T With Without Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Hormone-Resistant Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess feasibility , base percent able willing receive three infusion sipuleucel-T immunotherapy , combine sipuleucel-T radiation therapy single site metastasis deliver one week prior begin sipuleucel-T therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess effect radiation therapy single metastasis immune response ( antibody T-cell proliferation prostate acid phosphate [ PAP ] fusion protein PA2024 ) generate sipuleucel-T immunotherapy . II . To assess effect external beam radiotherapy single metastasis prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) response therapy sipuleucel-T. III . To assess effect external beam radiotherapy single metastasis radiographic response rate therapy sipuleucel-T. IV . To assess time onset therapy sipuleucel-T +/- radiation need subsequent therapy prostate cancer . V. To assess toxicity associate sipuleucel-T +/- radiation . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive sipuleucel-T intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 22 , 36 , 50 . ARM B : Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy week 1-2 . Patients also receive sipuleucel-T Arm A . In arm , treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow week 60 .</detailed_description>
