	<detailed_description>The great trochanteric pain syndrome ( GTPS ) frequent soft tissue syndrome often recognise medical practitioner . Currently , validate definition syndrome classically define pain tenderness region great trochanter may radiate postero-lateral aspect thigh may mimic nerve root compression . The prevalence GTPS amongst adult patient refer spine clinic chronic low back pain ( LBP ) report 20-35 % . In addition pain , GTPS induce functional disability time may profoundly interfere patient ' daily activity . The diagnosis GTPS suspect patient complain lateral hip pain . The reproduction typical pain palpation posterior part great trochanter well recognise clinical sign , although clinical sign describe . As frequently case type syndrome , physiopathology GTPS probably mixture several musculoskeletal problem , among trochanteric bursitis gluteus medius ( GMe ) tendinosis frequently cite . MRI study demonstrate GMe tendinosis tear patient GTPS MRI use gold standard diagnosis GTPS many study . Musculoskeletal ultrasound ( US ) increase interest among rheumatologist . It readily demonstrate soft tissue lesion , fluid collection , allow dynamic examination undertake ultrasound guide procedure . GMe gluteus minus ( GMi ) tendinopathy tear well bursitis clearly demonstrate ultrasound US may guide steroid injection treatment GMe tendinopathy . However , date study compare utility MRI compare US . There well-performed study regard treatment GTPS . Although poorly study , analgesic non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) often use first line therapy . The duration therapy require oral agent unknown significant potential side-effects treatment . The vast majority patient refer secondary tertiary centre fail oral therapy . Some author advocate physiotherapy ( massage stretch ) , strong evidence support approach . Thus , patient treat injection combination steroid local anaesthetic . However , convince evidence literature practice effective . The use musculoskeletal ultrasound ( US ) show improve accuracy corticosteroid injection many joint extra-articular structure bursa tendon sheath . Although small observational study suggest local corticosteroid injection may effective short term , prospective control study carry establish efficacy common intervention .</detailed_description>
