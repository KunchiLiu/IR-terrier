	<detailed_description>It report carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) insufflation reduce patient pain abdominal discomfort colonoscopy . Its safety efficacy colonoscopy even sedation already assess early trial . Air insufflation still standard method , however , due lack suitable replacement equipment technical improvement colonoscopy . In laparoscopic surgery , CO2 insufflation widely apply safely used patient general anesthesia . CO2 insufflation also apply CT colonography reduction discomfort procedure . During endoscopic procedure colorectal neoplasia resection , however , long procedural time may increase degree discomfort procedure also risk perforation . In addition laparoscopic surgery , CO2 insufflation also apply endoscopic procedure . Saito et al report application CO2 insufflation endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD ) colorectal neoplasia prospective study average procedural time use CO2 insufflation 90 minute conscious sedation average 5.6 mg midazolam . When compare control group use room air , statistically negligible difference pCO2 observe significant difference abdominal discomfort . Screening colonoscopy , complete within 15 minute lesion detect , require high screenee satisfaction improve patient compliance . In set colonoscopy positive FOBT , attendance rate secondary colonoscopy around 60 70 % accord data demonstrate previous RCT population-based study . Recently , radio frequency identification ( RFID ) technology , 'wireless automatic identification data capture ( AIDC ) technology emerge multidimensional innovation accelerate transformation healthcare process . The effective adoption use RFID technology expect transform intra- inter-organisational business process , thus allow intra- inter-firms business process innovation , real-time data collection share supply chain level , business analytics improved decision making . In specific context healthcare sector , RFID technology offer well mean patient identification , track , tracing.We use radio frequency identification ( RFID ) technology record number time duration toilet patient colonoscopy examination . These data may proxies discomfort . With application CO2 insufflation , time duration toilet examination decrease well patient 's discomfort procedure , improvement patient compliance anticipate .</detailed_description>
