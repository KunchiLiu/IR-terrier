	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte ( TIL ) combination chemotherapy work treat patient melanoma spread place body . Biological therapy , TIL , may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide fludarabine phosphate , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving TIL combination chemotherapy may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes After Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Examine anti-tumor efficacy cellular adoptive immunotherapy metastatic melanoma patient use autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte lymphodepleting condition regimen cyclophosphamide fludarabine ( fludarabine phosphate ) , follow adjuvant high-dose interleukin ( IL ) -2 ( aldesleukin ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine vivo persistence transfer tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte . II . Examine safety cellular adoptive immunotherapy melanoma patient use autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte , precede lymphodepleting condition regimen cyclophosphamide fludarabine , follow adjuvant high-dose IL-2 . III . Evaluate molecular tumor marker immunohistochemical feature correlate vivo persistence anti-tumor efficacy . OUTLINE : Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously ( IV ) day -7 -6 fludarabine phosphate IV day -5 -1 . Patients undergo TIL infusion 30-60 minute day 0 receive aldesleukin IV every 8 hour day 1-5 maximum 14 dos . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 , 12 , 24 week .</detailed_description>
