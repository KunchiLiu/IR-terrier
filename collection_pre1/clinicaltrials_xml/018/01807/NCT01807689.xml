	<brief_summary>This multi-center clinical study compare performance collective panel salivary biomarkers discriminate SS non-SS sicca cohort recruit three clinical site diagnostic outcome base new classification criterion Sjögren 's syndrome American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) develop 2012 . This treatment study , pilot study confirm diagnostic ability panel salivary biomarkers . All enrolled subject must classify oral ocular sicca symptom without another autoimmune/connective tissue disease ( Appendix 2 ) . At University California Los Angeles , use molecular technique , quantify discriminatory biomarkers saliva collect enrolled subject , also evaluate part clinical care use standard diagnostic test 2002 AECG criterion . We also test performance biomarkers predict diagnosis pSS accord AECG criterion , widely use test diagnose pSS assess disease activity worldwide .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim 1 : Test association use Odds Ratios seven individual biomarkers ( cathepsin D , α-enolase β-2-microglobulin [ B2M ] , anti-SSA , anti-SSB , anti-histone , anti-transglutaminase ) pSS build initial panel evaluate sensitivity specificity diagnosis SS time interim analysis use first 210 recruited subject . Hypothesis 1 : Individual biomarkers significantly associate SS . Hypothesis 2 : The panel sufficient sensitivity specificity diagnosis SS . Aim 2 : Test panel second 210 recruited subject , refine evaluate panel sensitivity specificity entire 420 subject . Hypothesis 1 : The panel build Aim 1 sufficient sensitivity specificity diagnosis SS . Hypothesis 2 : The refined panel sufficient sensitivity specificity diagnosis SS .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Ability give inform consent ( Appendix 1 ) . Male female patient 18 year age old . Patients sicca symptom define Appendix 2 . Must willing standard physical exam part standard clinical care complete diagnostic workup accord new ACR criterion ocular staining , labial salivary gland biopsy serology . Must willing standard physical exam complete AECG diagnostic test part standard clinical care ( include eye exam , oral exam , salivary gland exam biopsy ) . Must willing complete questionnaire ( approximately 10 min ) . Must willing donate 1ml stimulate , whole saliva 30 minute less . If participant produce 1ml 30 min collection period , subject unevaluable consider screen failure withdrawn study . For UMCG , subject must willing labial salivary gland biopsy addition parotid biopsy . Must willing able give approximately 8ml blood . Must willing test Hepatitis C , require Previous radiation head neck . Confirmed hepatitis C virus infection , may cause SSlike sign symptom . Known HIV infection , cause salivary gland infiltrate enlargement similar SS . Sarcoidosis , may cause SSlike sign symptom . Graftversushost disease , may cause SSlike sign symptom . Oral cancer history oral cancer . Pregnancy base selfreport . Previously diagnose pSS sSS use AECG criterion SS use ACR criterion . Previously confirm diagnosis autoimmune disease know associated Secondary Sjögren 's syndrome ( sSS ) ( rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) ) , CREST ( Calcinosis , Raynaud 's syndrome , Esophageal dysmotility , Sclerodactyly , Telangiectasia ) , Scleroderma , Mixed connective tissue disease , Polymyositis .</criteria>
