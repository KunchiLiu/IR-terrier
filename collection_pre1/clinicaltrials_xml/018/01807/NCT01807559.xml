	<criteria>Subjects previously enrol SoundBite Hearing System Long Term Multi Site Patient Use Study ( Protocol CLN006 ) complete 12 month study visit . Additionally , subject must meet one two criterion hear loss : 1 . Moderately severe , severe , profound sensorineural hearing loss one ear normal hearing ear ( i.e . single side deafness `` SSD '' ) . Normal hearing define pure tone average ( PTA ) airconduction ( AC ) hearing threshold ( measure 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 3 kHz ) good equal 25 dB HL . OR 2 . Conductive hearing loss pure tone average boneconduction hearing threshold ( measure 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 3 kHz ) good equal 25 dB HL . Subjects meet one two audiometric criterion measure audiogram 12 month study appointment Protocol CLN006 : 1 . A moderately severe , severe , profound sensorineural hearing loss one ear normal hearing ear ( i.e . single side deafness ―SSD‖ ) . Normal hearing define pure tone average ( PTA ) airconduction ( AC ) hearing threshold ( measure 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 3 kHz ) good equal 25 dB HL . 2 . Patients conductive hearing loss pure tone average boneconduction hearing threshold ( measure 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 3 kHz ) good equal 25 dB HL The SoundBite Hearing System portion contraindicate use MRI Environment remove prior MRI exposure The SoundBite Hearing System use patient know hypersensitivity component include allergy polymer . The SoundBite Hearing system contraindicate vulnerable population unable use hand paraplegic others unable comply warning product 's labeling .</criteria>
