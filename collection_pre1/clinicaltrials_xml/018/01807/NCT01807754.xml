	<detailed_description>This pilot , simulate breast cancer screen study . In population enrich mammographic call-back , study whether : 1 ) Combined digital breast tomosynthesis ( DBT ) /dual-sides 3 dimensional-automated ultrasound ( AUS ) result low call-back rate digital breast tomosynthesis ( DBT ) alone . 2 . Explore utility photoacoustic imaging adjunct digital breast tomosynthesis ( DBT ) /ultrasound ( US ) alone . This study compare two new breast image system digital mammography hand-held ultrasound commonly use find evaluate breast mass . Images do digital breast tomosynthesis ( DBT ) 3-D automate ultrasound ( AUS ) do breast image clinic main hospital follow second light ultrasound image complete research lab .</detailed_description>
