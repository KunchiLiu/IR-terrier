	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare three treatment modality central , mixed obstructive central , sleep apnea patient chronic heart failure reduce ejection fraction . The modality test nocturnal supplemental oxygen ( NSO ) continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) . The main outcome measure leave ventricular ejection fraction echocardiogram peak oxygen consumption cardiopulmonary exercise testing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic heart failure ( HF ) highly prevalent disease , lifetime risk approximately 20 % . Sleep apnea common co-morbid condition , occur approximately half patient chronic HF , often predominantly central mixed obstructive central characteristic . Although associate increased mortality patient HF , sleep apnea usually asymptomatic patient therefore often unwilling accept standard therapy positive airway pressure . At outset study , three treatment modality currently recommend American Academy Sleep Medicine treatment predominantly central sleep apnea HF patient : nocturnal supplemental oxygen ( NSO ) , continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) adaptive servo-ventilation ( ASV ) . Recently , ASV find increase mortality patient heart failure reduce ejection fraction central sleep apnea . There limited data comparative efficacy tolerability three modality . The present study design compare modality respect effect ventricular function , exercise capacity , measure cardiovascular risk .</detailed_description>
