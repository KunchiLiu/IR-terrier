	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Tivozanib Advanced Hepatocellular Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Angiogenesis formation new blood vessel . Angiogenesis driven cytokine include vascular endothelial growth factor . Tivozanib oral medication inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor prevent tumor develop new blood vessel . The purpose study evaluate effect tivozanib hepatocellular ( liver ) cancer . Participants study take tivozanib daily dose 1 mg 1month . well dose would increase 1.5 mg per day . Patients monitor response use CT MRI scan every 2months . In addition , patient blood draws evaluate effect tivozanib blood vessel .</detailed_description>
