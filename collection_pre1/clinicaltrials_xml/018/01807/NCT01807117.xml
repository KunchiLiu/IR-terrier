	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study positron emission tomography ( PET ) -magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) PET-computed tomography ( CT ) diagnostic image patient colon and/or rectal cancer . New diagnostic imaging procedure , PET-MRI , may help find diagnose rectal cancer recurrence colorectal cancer</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET-MRI Diagnosing Patients With Colon Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To test diagnostic performance PET- MRI stag preoperative high-grade rectal cancer patient , define T3 stage high N1 stage high presence metastasis , refer PET-CT MRI . II . To test diagnostic performance PET-MRI follow colorectal cancer patient refer PET-CT without diagnostic MRI request physician . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To test different attenuation correction MR sequence novel diagnostic MR sequence . OUTLINE : Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET-CT PET-MRI .</detailed_description>
