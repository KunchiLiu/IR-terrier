	<brief_title>Comparison Two Strategies Oropharyngeal Tracheal Suctioning Mechanically Ventilated Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>• Study design : This open prospective , cross-over cohort study , include patient ventilate one medical intensive care unit . Two procedure compare two distinct , randomly decide cross-over consecutive period • Detailed description : Standard care include tracheal suction several time day . They induce cough reflex non paralyse patient lead mobilisation endotracheal tube consecutive raise risk tracheal microaspiration . Thus drainage subglottic secretion tracheal suction expect reduce microaspiration . Subglottic secretion drainage could decrease risk Ventilator Associated Pneumonia even remain confirmed . However , study assess efficiency reduce tracheal microaspiration . An optimization oropharyngeal suction procedure include use subglottic drainage specify order realize call `` optimized oral care '' . A comparison do routine oral care . We conduct crossover study patient 's follow-up last 2 day . Length suction procedure mouth care , volume oral , subglottic tracheal secretion qualitative appearance collect . The amylase enzymatic activity assess oropharyngeal , subglottic tracheal sample . • Registry procedure : All request information record case report form explanation report miss data . False data clearly correct , sign investigator authorise person . For biochemical data ( amylase enzymatic activity ) , result transmit excel software via key data integrate principal excel file professional computer investigator . Monitoring realise co-investigator association clinical research associate . - Quality factor . This clinical research associate regularly check data compare data enter registry predefined rule range consistency data field registry report report check . - Sample size assessment : Number subject : 24 patient . Six month necessary include patient . - Statistical analysis : The sample size estimate assume median ratio 8 % estimate reduction 8 2 % optimized oral care . We determine 12 patient per group would provide power 80 % , α level 5 % . Results express mean ± Standard Deviation . Continuous variable compare use Student 's t-test matched pair series categorical variable use Chi 2 test . All p value confidence interval two-tailed . p &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
