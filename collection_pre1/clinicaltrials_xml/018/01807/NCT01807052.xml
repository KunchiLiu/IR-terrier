	<detailed_description>STUDY SUBTYPE : Ancillary/Correlative OBSERVATIONAL STUDY MODEL : Case-only TIME PERSPECTIVE : Retrospective BIOSPECIMEN RETENTION : Samples without DNA BIOSPECIMEN DESCRIPTION : Tissue sample obtain Cooperative Human Tissue Network ( CHTN ) STUDY POPULATION DESCRIPTION : Patients enrol P9754 AOST0121 clinical trial SAMPLING METHOD : Non-probability sample PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine differential expression tumor factor ( TF ) among patient osteosarcoma . II . To determine association overall survival disease free survival extent TF expression . III . To determine TF expression correlate presence gross metastatic disease presentation , development subsequent metastasis . OUTLINE : Tissue sample analyze tumor factor expression level immunohistochemistry .</detailed_description>
