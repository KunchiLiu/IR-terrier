	<brief_summary>The primary objective study determine tumor patient papillomavirus ( HPV ) positive negative squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) long respond standard therapy decrease size follow treatment investigational drug , rigosertib sodium ( ON 01910.Na ) . A secondary objective determine treatment rigosertib cause side effect . Rigosertib investigational drug , mean approved U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat disease . We study rigosertib new anticancer drug . Tests do laboratory suggest rigosertib work block cell division cancer cell cause die .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral Rigosertib Squamous Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multicenter , Phase II study evaluate safety efficacy oral rigosertib patient relapse metastatic squamous cell carinoma ( SCC ) previously receive platinum-based chemotherapy and/or chemo-radiation therapy . Only patient head neck squamous cell carinoma ( HNSCC ) , non-small cell lung SCC , skin SCC , cervical SCC , penile SCC , anal SCC esophageal SCC enrol study . Patients administer rigosertib capsule dose 560 mg BID day 1 14 21-day cycle . Patients enrol 2 cohort base HPV test result : - Cohort 1 include 40 patient human papillomavirus ( HPV ) -positive SCC , approximately 30 patient HNSCC , approximately 10 patient SCC another origin ( eg , cervix , anal , penile ) ; - Cohort 2 include 40 patient HPV-negative SCC , approximately 30 patient HNSCC , approximately 10 patient SCC another origin ( eg , lung , skin , esophageal ) . Patients evaluated progression complete 3 cycle therapy every 3 cycle thereafter . Patients stable disease ( SD ) well , base revise Response Criteria Solid Tumors ( mRECIST ) 1.1 , receive repeat cycle treatment 21-day cycle schedule disease progression , development unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent . Patients progressive disease ( PD ) , opinion Investigator , appear derive clinical benefit , may continue study plan disease reassessment one cycle therapy . Should patient SD PR reassessment , s/he may continue study , subsequent reassessment every 3 cycle . Following discontinuation rigosertib treatment , patient ' mortality status assess every 3 month .</detailed_description>
