	<brief_summary>Four hypothesis test study : 1 . The intervention group perform good child , parent transaction outcome control group throughout follow-up period . 2 . The intervention group show great change early neurophysiological brain function transaction within family lead good neurodevelopmental outcome control group . 3 . Certain polymorphisms dopamine-related gene associate neurodevelopmental outcome VLBW preterm infant . 4 . Very low birth weight preterm infant carry genetic plasticity dopamine-related gene may benefit intervention carry less genetic plasticity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Family-Centered Intervention Program Preterm Infants : Effects Their Biosocial Pathways</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A total 250 VLBW preterm infant prospectively recruit three medical center northern southern Taiwan randomly assign FCIP UCP group . Outcome assessment include primary ( child medical , growth development ) secondary measure ( parent transaction within family ) . The neurophysiological transaction data examine whether mediate intervention effect child development . In addition , infant 153 VLBW preterm infant prior intervention study collect buccal cell assessment polymorphisms dopamine-related gene , involve neurotransmission cognitive , sensori-motor behavioral-emotional system postulate associated several developmental psychiatric illness . The polymorphisms dopamine-related gene examine potential moderating influence effect intervention child development .</detailed_description>
