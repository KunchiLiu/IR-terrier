	<brief_title>Brentuximab Vedotin Treating Patients With Advanced Systemic Mastocytosis Mast Cell Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response rate SGN-35 ( brentuximab vedotin ) patient tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily , member 8 ( CD30+ ) advance systemic mastocytosis ( SM ) ( ASM mast cell leukemia [ MCL ] without associate hematological clonal non-mast cell lineage disease [ AHNMD ] ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate tolerability safety profile SGN-35 patient SM . II . To evaluate expression CD30 neoplastic mast cell therapy SGN-35 . III . To evaluate change mastocytosis related symptom score quality life ( QOL ) use modify Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form ( MPNSAF ) . IV . To evaluate duration response ( DoR ) time response ( TTR ) . V. To evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 week 1 year every 12 week thereafter .</detailed_description>
