	<detailed_description>1 . Research Plan : Patients : Patients 18 year age old refer adult cardiovascular Echocardiograms : Patients focus echocardiogram perform Cardiovascular Clinic rest immediately symptom limited treadmill stress . Echocardiograms obtain leave lateral decubitus position iE33 ( Philips , The Netherlands ) machine equip broadband S5-1 transducer ( frequency transmit 1.7MHz , receive 3.4 MHz ) . Parasternal long- short axis view obtain basal ( tips mitral valve visualize ) , midventricular ( papillary muscle visualize ) apical level ( proximal level end-systolic LV luminal obliteration , transducer position 1 2 intercostal space caudal allow LV view circular possible ) . Additionally , three standard apical view ( 4-chamber , 2-chamber , 3-chamber ) obtain . To optimize speckle tracking , image acquire high frame rate possible ( 50-90 frames/s ) every effort make endocardial epicardial border visualize throughout cardiac cycle . Pulsed wave Doppler acquire level mitral valve leaflet tip , pulmonary vein see apical 4-chamber view . A color Doppler M-mode image include LV apex open mitral valve obtain upper Nyquist limit set 45cm/sec . Tissue Doppler velocity acquire medial lateral mitral annulus . Echocardiogram Analysis : All data analysis perform investigator mask patient 's history peak VO2 6 minute walk result . LV end-systolic end-diastolic volume ejection fraction determine manual trace end-systolic end-diastolic endocardial border use apical 4- 2-chamber view , employ Simpson 's biplane method . Pulsed wave Doppler level mitral valve leaflet tip use determine peak early ( E ) atrial ( A ) filling velocity , deceleration time ( DT ) . Tissue Doppler use determine peak early ( E ' ) velocity medial lateral mitral annulus . The LV apical color M Mode image use determine propagation velocity . Speckle Tracking Analysis : Analyses perform use QLAB advanced quantification software version 7.1 ( Philips , The Netherlands ) . Short axis long axis image automatically divide six segment . Automated track myocardial speckle review manually adjust minimally possible . The track quality segment visually evaluate track felt inaccurate , strain analysis segment include . Speckle track analysis provide peak time peak measure circumferential , radial longitudinal strain 18 LV segment . Additionally , speckle trace analysis provide peak time peak measure bulk , endocardial epicardial twist basal , mid , apical LV region . If less 2/3 component compute variable available , compute variable included relevant analysis . Graded exercise test assessment peak oxygen consumption ( Stress Protocol ) : We use Naughton-Balke treadmill protocol speed keep 3.0 mph grade increase 2.5 % every 2 minutesâ€” modify protocol use 2.0 mph adopt slow walker . A valid test define accord ATS/ACCP statement cardiopulmonary exercise test meeting least one follow criterion : Plateau VO2 , heart rate ( HR ) within 10 beats/min age-predicted maximal HR , respiratory exchange ratio &gt; 1.10 , exhaustion define RPE 9-10 Borg CR-10 scale , achievement predict maximal work rate . Patients verbally encouraged test , give maximal effort goal achieve physiological limitation . Criteria exercise termination include : chest pain suggestive ischemia , ischemic ECG change , complex ectopy , second third degree heart block , fall systolic blood pressure &gt; 20mmHg high value test , hypertension ( &gt; 250 mmHg systolic ; &gt; 120 diastolic ) , severe desaturation : SpO2 &lt; 80 % accompany symptom sign severe hypoxemia , sudden pallor , loss coordination , mental confusion , dizziness faintness , sign respiratory failure . In situation test prematurely terminate patient observe stable physiologic variable return baseline condition . If necessary base criterion physician , admission hospital may warrant . Resuscitation ( i.e . crash cart ) equipment available laboratory occurrence . Quantification peak oxygen consumption : Oxygen consumption measure use portable Cosmed K4b2 . The Cosmed K4b2 weigh 1.5 kg , include battery specially design harness validate Douglas bag steady-state exercise . The mass device add total body mass calculate peak oxygen consumption ml/kg/min . Oxygen consumption measure breath-by-breath subsequently average 10-second period . Participants ask talk test instruct use hand signal communicate research assistant . Heart rate measure simultaneously task use Polar heart rate monitor ( Model RS100 , Polar Electro Inc. ) . As October 2015 functional capacity evaluate 6 minute walk test . 2 . Possible Discomforts Risks : The major risk undertake study cardiopulmonary exercise test . In general , maximal symptom-limited exercise test relatively safe procedure . In survey 1,375 clinical exercise test facility , risk die cardiopulmonary exercise test 0.5 per 10,000 test . It important understand exercise perform outside clinic set regular basis without supervision . We take every measure possible limit risk exercise study participant . We conduct thorough medical examination review rest ECG prior exercise . Those patient contraindication exercise test exercise continue study . Additionally , continuously monitor 12-lead ECGs exercise check sign myocardial ischemia . A fully equip crash cart available event occur . All treadmill test conduct supervision physician and/or appropriately trained nurse practitioner . The nurse practitioner train certified exercise testing . All test supervisor thorough knowledge normal abnormal exercise response certify cardiac life support . They able recognize abnormal rhythm ST depression electrocardiogram . All sit on-call access study physician contact number emergency service . Institutional community EMS service activate need . 3 . Possible Benefits : There possible benefit health patient study . Discoveries make investigation could potentially benefit study participant patient cardiovascular disease future .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients 18 year age old refer adult cardiovascular heart failure clinic evaluation heart failure LV dysfunction . Patients contraindication exercise testing : ( myocardial infarction within 2 day , unstable angina , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , severe aortic stenosis , uncontrolled symptomatic heart failure , recent pulmonary embolism , recent myocarditis , history aortic dissection , untreated ischemic CAD , blood pressure &gt; 200/110 , history untreated tachy brady arrhythmia , hypertrophic cardiomyopathy , inability perform exercise physical mental impairment ) exclude study .</criteria>
