	<brief_title>Prospective , Randomized Clinical Trial Evaluating ETView Double-Lumen Tube</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In several clinical situation surgical procedure single-lung ventilation ( SLV ) essential . Especially thoracic surgery SLV collapse operate lung , ventilate side lung frequent indication . In case double lumen tube ( DLT ) widely use device . The DLT consist proximal tracheal distal bronchial end , reach leave right side lung- dependent model tube . Endotracheal intubation DLT , much large stiff conventional single-lumen tube , much difficult place especially likely provoke airway injury . Furthermore , placement DLT require obligatory fiberoptic bronchoscopy certain level experience . Tube misplacement patient removal dorsal ( intubation- ) lateral position well surgical procedure relatively frequent . Tube displacement proper position carina , respectively main bronchus , may result life-threating complication airway laceration . The anesthetist may detect tube misplacement indirect clinical sign include increase airway pressure , oxygen desaturation , difficulty perform SLV . In clinical situation , verification tube position use fibreoptic bronchoscopy indicate . Fibreoptic bronchoscopy require rigorous train practice maintain high level skill well expensive infrastructure . The VivaSight-DL ( ETView Ltd , M.P . Misgav 20174 , Israel ) new DLT promising exceed clinical performance conventional DLT . The VivaSight-DL basically left-sided DLT embed video image device light source tip integrate cable connector . However , correct tube placement , video imaging device focus main carina , indicate correct position bronchial cuff leave main bronchus .</detailed_description>
