	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose pomalidomide give combination melphalan dexamethasone give patient AL amyloidosis . The safety drug combination also study . Pomalidomide design change body 's immune system . It may also interfere development tiny blood vessel help support tumor growth . This may decrease growth cancer cell . Melphalan design damage DNA ( genetic material ) cell , may cause cancer cell die . Dexamethasone corticosteroid similar natural hormone make body . Dexamethasone often give Multiple Myeloma ( MM ) patient combination chemotherapy treat cancer . Planned Phase I/II Study terminate early Phase I portion without continuation Phase II .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pomalidomide With Melphalan Dexamethasone Untreated Systemic AL Amyloidosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign dose level pomalidomide , base join study . Up 4 dose level pomalidomide test Phase I portion study . Up 30 participant enrol dose level Phase I portion , 24 participant enrol Phase II . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose pomalidomide find . If enrol Phase II portion , receive pomalidomide high dose tolerate Phase I portion . All participant receive dose level dexamethasone melphalan . If intolerable side effect see low dose level , melphalan dose lower . After 2 cycle therapy , may refer transplant specialist , eligible stem cell transplant . Study Drug Administration : Each cycle 28 day . Treatment Phase : You take pomalidomide pill mouth Days 1-21 cycle . You take dose pomalidomide time every day .

If able become pregnant , pregnancy test also perform . - Urine collect routine test . - If doctor think need , EKG ECHO . On Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond : - Your medical history review record . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Your performance status record . - You complete 2 questionnaire quality-of-life , general health , level pain , disease affect . It take 15 minute complete questionnaire . - If doctor think need , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) urine ( 24 hour ) collect check status disease . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . If able become pregnant , pregnancy test also perform . - Urine collect routine test . - If doctor think need , EKG ECHO . On Day 15 Cycles 1 beyond : -If able become pregnant , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw pregnancy test . Length Study : The Treatment Phase study take 6 month complete . If study doctor think benefit study drug combination , go Maintenance Phase . You continue take study drug ( ) experience intolerable side effect , disease get bad , study doctor think best interest stop . End-of-Treatment Visit : If go study reason , end-of-treatment visit within 30 day last dose study drug combination follow test procedure perform : - Your medical history review record . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You ECHO . - Your performance status record . - You complete 2 questionnaire quality-of-life , general health , level pain , disease affect . It take 15 minute complete questionnaire . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn check status disease . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . If able become pregnant , pregnancy test also perform 28 day last dose pomalidomide regular period 14 28 day last dose pomalidomide irregular period . - If doctor think necessary , MRI CT scan check status disease . - If doctor think possible , bone marrow aspiration biopsy check status disease genetic testing . Long Term Follow-Up : After end-of-treatment visit , contact either telephone one standard care office visit every 3 6 month ask . If contact phone , call take 5 minute . This investigational study . Pomalidomide , Melphalan , Dexamethasone FDA approve commercially available treatment MM . The study drug combination FDA approve commercially available first-line treatment AL amyloidosis . It currently use research purpose . Up 54 patient enrol The University Texas ( UT ) MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
