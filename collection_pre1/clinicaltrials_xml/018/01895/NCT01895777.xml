	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Male female subject 0 less 18 year age time inform consent / assent Documented diagnosis VTE per investigator judgment initially treat ( generally 57 day , longer 21 day ) parenteral anticoagulation therapy , unfractionated heparin ( UFH ) low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) . Clinical indication least 3 month treatment anticoagulant VTE episode define inclusion criterion . Written inform consent provide patient 's parent legal guardian assent provide patient ( applicable ) time informed consent form ( ICF ) signature accord local regulation . Exclusion criterion : Conditions associate increase risk bleed Renal dysfunction ( eGFR &lt; 80 mL/min/1.73m2 use Schwartz formula ) requirement dialysis Active infective endocarditis Subjects mechanical biological heart valve prosthesis Hepatic disease : Active liver disease , include know active hepatitis A , B C , Persistent alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate transaminase ( AST ) alkaline phosphatase ( AP ) &gt; 3 Ã— upper limit normal ( ULN ) within 3 month screen Pregnant breast feeding female . Females reach menarche use medically accept contraceptive method per local guideline .

Transfusions screen period allow , provide satisfactory hemoglobin platelet level attain prior visit 2 Patients take prohibit restricted medication within one week first dose study medication medication prior VTE treatment Pglycoprotein inhibitors.. Patients receive investigational drug past 30 day prior screen Patients allergic/sensitive component study medication include solvent Patients parents/legal guardian consider unreliable participate trial per investigator judgment condition would present safety hazard patient base investigator judgment Patients parents/legal guardian unwilling unable undergo permit repeat baseline image test require confirm thrombus resolution study day 84 ( eEOT , whichever come first ) repeat image test prespecified time point may medically patient 's best interest . Examples may include unwarranted radiation exposure result repeat CT scan day 84 patient isolate case pulmonary embolism evaluate baseline solely CT scan . In case , baseline radiological assessment ( e.g . CT ) may supplement acceptable nonradiological assessment baseline ( e.g . MRI ) could repeat day 84 hence alleviate potential unwarranted radiation exposure . Further exclusion criterion apply</criteria>
