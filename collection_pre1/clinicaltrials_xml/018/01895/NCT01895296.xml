	<brief_summary>Dumping Syndrome consists ( 1 ) rapid gastric emptying , ( 2 ) inappropriate release GI hormone ( reaction hyperosmolar content duodenum ) ( 3 ) hyperinsulinemic response rapid absorption glucose . Because well know somatostatin receptor ( ) ( sst1-5 ) influence ( ) Dumping Syndrome , goal trial evaluate : - effect pasireotide ( sst1 , 2 , 3 , 5 agonist ) control gastric emptying . - effect pasireotide ( sst1 , 2 , 3 , 5 agonist ) release GI hormone ( OGTT ) . - effect pasireotide ( sst1 , 2 , 3 , 5 agonist ) hyperinsulimic response ( OGTT ) . - efficacy pasireotide ( sst1 , 2 , 3 , 5 agonist ) control objective parameter Dumping Syndrome ( hematocrit ( Hct ) , pulse rate occurrence hypoglycemia Oral Glucose Tolerance Test ( OGTT ) 75g glucose ) - efficacy pasireotide ( sst1 , 2 , 3 , 5 agonist ) control overall symptom measure combined Dumping Syndrome score - efficacy pasireotide ( sst1 , 2 , 3 , 5 agonist ) control symptom measure ( ) early ( b ) late phase dump symptom score separately - efficacy pasireotide ( sst1 , 2 , 3 , 5 agonist ) control quality life ( QoL SF-36 )</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male female patient age 18 80 year . Patients diagnosis Dumping Syndrome : Having symptom Dumping Syndrome ( sum combine Dumping Syndrome score â‰¥10 ) AND either ( ) document episode postprandial hypoglycemia medical history either ( b ) demonstrate hypoglycemia ( &lt; 60mg/dl ) hematocrite increase &gt; 3 % pulse increase 10 bpm oral glucose tolerance test 75 g glucose . Patients write informed consent participate study obtain . Patients need provide inform consent prior start medication washout period Patients undergone major surgery/surgical therapy cause within 1 month Patients symptomatic cholecystolithiasis medical history unless cholecystectomy perform ( ultrasound abdomen maximum 6 month old ) . Patients fail treatment somatostatin analogue past ( specifically patient treat octreotide s.c. 2 day long act somatostatin analogue 8 week ) . Patients treat somatostatin analogue last 12 week inclusion . Patients know hypersensitivity somatostatin analogue . Patients diagnosis Diabetes Mellitus Patients important comorbidity ( cardiac , pulmonary , renal , hepatic disease ) Patients abnormal coagulation ( PT PTT elevate 30 % normal limit ) Patients receive anticoagulant affect PT PTT Female patient pregnant lactating , childbearing potential practicing medically acceptable method birth control . Female patient must use barrier contraception addition condom . If oral contraception use , patient must practice method least three month prior enrollment must agree continue oral contraceptive throughout course study , three month study end . Male patient sexually active require use condom study 3 month afterwards . History immunocompromise , include positive HIV test result ( ELISA Western blot ) . A HIV test require ; however , previous medical history review Patients participate clinical investigation investigational drug within 1 month prior dose Patients additional active malignant disease within last five year ( exception basal cell carcinoma carcinoma situ cervix ) Patients presence active suspect acute chronic uncontrolled infection Patients history noncompliance medical regimen consider potentially unreliable unable complete entire study</criteria>
