	<brief_summary>The efficacy buprenorphine long-term agonist treatment offset emergence intolerable withdrawal phenomenon subset individual chronic maintenance attempt discontinue medication . Efforts need well understand challenge encounter buprenorphine , well develop intervention facilitate medication discontinuation . Emerging evidence suggest difficulty may relate unique effect buprenorphine sit mu-opioid receptor , kappa-opioid receptor . Kappa-opioid agonism produce aversive , dysphoric-like effect , also increase likelihood reinstatement drug use stress-mediated mechanism . Some discomfort observe drug taper may therefore due attenuation loss kappa-opioid antagonism afford buprenorphine , well rebound kappa-opioid activation . Naltrexone represent promise candidate extend kappa blockade therefore facilitate discontinuation attempt . Naltrexone active metabolite 6-Beta-naltrexol competitive antagonist mu kappa receptor , less extent delta receptor . Naltrexone buprenorphine comparable affinity mu-opioid receptor thus buprenorphine displace naltrexone gradually opioids less affinity ; careful titration naltrexone less likely , therefore , precipitate severe withdrawal state individual come buprenorphine , two combine good effect setting . The purpose study therefore investigate feasibility naltrexone augmentation discontinue buprenorphine eligible patient long-term maintenance .</brief_summary>
