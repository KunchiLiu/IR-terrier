	<brief_title>Ruxolitinib Patients With Low Intermediate-1 Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 4 group 3-6 participant enrol Part 1 study , 7 participant enrol Part 2 . If enrol Part 1 , dose ruxolitinib receive depend join study . The first group participant receive low dose ruxolitinib . The second group participant receive low dose ruxolitinib 1 cycle intolerable side effect see , dose increase next high dose Cycles 2 beyond . The third group participant receive high dose take second group 1 cycle intolerable side effect see , dose increase Cycles 2 beyond . The fourth group participant take high dose take third group 1 cycle intolerable side effect see , dose increase next high dose Cycles 2 beyond . If enrol Part 2 , receive ruxolitinib high dose tolerate Part 1 . Study Drug Administration : Each cycle 28 day . You take ruxolitinib mouth 2 time day ( 12 hour apart ) , without food . Study Visits : One ( 1 ) time week Cycles 1 2 Day 1 Cycles 3 beyond , blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Day 28 cycle Day 1 Cycles 3 beyond , blood may also use cytogenetic test doctor think need . On Day 28 Cycles 1 2 every 3 cycle , bone marrow aspiration check status disease cytogenetic testing , doctor think need . On Day 28 Cycle 1 Day 1 Cycles 3 beyond , physical exam . If doctor think need , urine collect Day 1 cycle routine test . Length Dosing : You may continue take study drug 2 year . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study end-of-dosing visit . End-of-Dosing Visit : After finish take study drug : - You physical exam . - You bone marrow aspiration check status disease . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . This blood may also use cytogenetic test doctor think need . Follow-up Visit : About 30 day End-of-Dosing visit , member study team contact phone . You ask feel side effect may experience . This phone call take 10-15 minute . This investigational study . Ruxolitinib FDA approve commercially available treatment myelofibrosis . Its use study investigational . The study doctor explain ruxolitinib design work . Up 31 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
