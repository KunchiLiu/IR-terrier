	<brief_summary>The propose research study cross-sectional study enrol young child sickle cell disease 5 12 year age . They screen outpatient consent perform pulmonary function test ( PFT ) echocardiography . In addition , degree bronchodilator response assess session . To estimate presence pulmonary hypertension , echocardiography perform time PFT measure . Study Design : 1 . Enroll child age 5 12 year age sickle cell disease ( HbSS , HbSC , HbS beta plus thalassemia , HbS beta zero thalassemia , HbS OArab ) establish patient within Duke Pediatric Sickle Cell Clinic . 2 . Perform chart review enrol subject obtain specific detail regard birth history , nutritional status ( weight , height ) , family history , sickle cell genotype , parental smoking history , recent laboratory parameter , parental smoking history , concurrent condition ( atopy , asthma , airway anomaly ) , history sickle cell complication prescribe medication . 3 . Perform spirometry plethysmography administration albuterol . 4 . Before completion PFT session , patient echocardiography PFT lab area 5 . Using medical record information , determine number hospitalization pulmonary symptom indicative acute chest syndrome ( ACS ) ( dyspnea , fever , wheeze , hypoxia , cough , chest pain ) . In addition , track respiratory cardiac symptom therapy subject 6 year enrollment age 18 year use registry . 6 . As standard care , refer child identify lung disease pulmonary hypertension pediatric pulmonologist and/or cardiologist monitoring , treatment ongoing care .</brief_summary>
