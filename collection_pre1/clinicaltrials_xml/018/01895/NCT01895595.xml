	<brief_summary>Guided imagery , mind-body complementary/alternative treatment modality , offer promise reduce stress promote lifestyle behavior change reduce diabetes heart disease risk obese Latino adolescent . The overall purpose study determine whether guided imagery , could reduce diabetes risk obese Latino adolescent undergo lifestyle intervention . The specific objective : 1 ) To pilot test new 12-week lifestyle intervention obese Latino adolescent , order determine effect mind-body technique Interactive Guided ImagerySM , healthy lifestyle education , eat physical activity behavior , stress stress biomarkers , hormonal marker diabetes risk ; 2 ) To explore way change stress produce intervention associate change hormonal marker diabetes risk , particularly insulin resistance . The investigator hypothesize participant receive guided imagery program addition healthy lifestyle education would show great improvement insulin resistance , physical activity , dietary intake , stress , receive healthy lifestyle education without guided imagery . The investigator hypothesize reduction stress due intervention would associate improvement insulin resistance , major hormonal marker diabetes risk . For study , obese , Latino adolescent ( age 14-17 ) randomize receive either 12 weekly session lifestyle education plus guided imagery program , lifestyle education plus digital storytelling computer program ( control ) . Outcome measure assess 12-week intervention , compare difference intervention group behavioral ( eat physical activity behavior ) , biological ( insulin resistance stress hormone ) , psychological ( stress ) outcomes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The current proposal pilot test investigator ' guide imagery intervention limit sample subject order refine intervention ( Study 1 ) proceeds test intervention control , randomize trial ( Study 2 ) . Study 1 : Pilot test refinement guide imagery program Specific Aim 1 : To pilot , evaluate , complete development guide imagery intervention program base stress reduction improve lifestyle behavior use overweight Latino adolescent . Outcome Objectives : Findings Study 1 permit u test intervention via control , randomize trial Study 2 . Study Design The guided imagery intervention program combine lifestyle education program pilot , one module weekly 12 week , 8 overweight Latino adolescent ( 4 male , 4 female ) . Upon completion pilot intervention , participant participate idea-building session experience program , order develop idea add modify program . Participants discuss acceptability , cultural relevance , developmental appropriateness obstacle efficacy delivery program . The information session analyze order improve intervention 's developmental cultural relevance appeal . Analyses idea-building data similar analysis use focus group data , include recording , transcription , examination data emergent theme . Based information obtain pilot study idea-building session , program modify intervention study , Study 2 . Study 2 : Clinical trial guide imagery program intervention Specific Aim 2 : To conduct randomize controlled trial test direct mediate effect add guided imagery intervention program lifestyle education program . Major outcome include insulin sensitivity , psychosocial measure , dietary physical activity behavior . Hypotheses 1 . The addition guide imagery intervention program lifestyle education program effective lifestyle education program alone increase insulin sensitivity ( independent body fat ) , improve body composition , reduce stress hormone ( cortisol ) secretion , decrease cardiovascular risk factor . 2 . The addition guide imagery intervention program effective lifestyle education alone improve health-promoting dietary physical activity behavior . 3 . The guided imagery intervention program change behavior physiology lower stress change meaning dietary physical activity behavior . Study Design This study 12-week randomize , control clinical trial . After collection baseline psychosocial , behavioral , metabolic outcome measurement , participant randomly assign either `` Treatment Group '' guide imagery program + lifestyle education ( n = 20 ) , `` Control Group '' lifestyle education + digital storytelling program ensure equal contact time ( n = 20 ) . At end 12-week treatment period , baseline measure repeat , differences outcome variable group assess . Inclusion Criteria : see Exclusion Criteria : see Participant Recruitment : Clinic-based recruitment , past list potential recruit prior study , referral hospital , local health fair , extensive word mouth . 12-Week Intervention Participants randomize treatment group ( lifestyle program plus guided imagery , n=20 ) control group ( lifestyle program alone , n=20 ) , stratify sex order ensure equal number girl boy study group . Control Treatment ( guide imagery ) intervention deliver weekly , 1.5 hour session 12-week period late afternoon school . Each session begin 45-minute lifestyle education component deliver group 4-8 subject , follow immediately individual 45 minute guide imagery module subject Treatment Group , individual 45 minute Digital Storytelling module subject Control Group , order ensure equal contact time . The lifestyle education program curriculum consist 12 weekly module focus decreased intake add sugar increase intake whole grain fiber diet , combine non-dieting philosophy intuitive eating . Educational content relate principal healthy nutrition physically active lifestyle contain within propose lifestyle education curriculum fully consistent expert committee recommendation obesity intervention adolescent . The guided imagery program curriculum consist 12 weekly , one-on-one imagery module base 2 major underlie theoretical principle : 1 ) relaxation/stress reduction imagery ; 2 ) imagery design improve eat physical activity behavior . The protocol one-on-one imagery module follow standard procedure Interactive Guided ImagerySM , consist 3 essential aspect : 1 ) foresight ( identification issue address imagery ) ; 2 ) insight ( facilitated imagery experience ) ; 3 ) hindsight ( discussion integration imagery experience ) . The digital storytelling program curriculum , control contact time research staff , consist 12 weekly 45-minute module deliver one-on-one immediately follow lifestyle education class week . Subjects learn create edit short film write script , gather medium ( image music ) , edit complete product . The subject free choose topic project , exclude topic relate obesity health behavior .</detailed_description>
