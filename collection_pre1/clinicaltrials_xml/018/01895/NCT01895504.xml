	<brief_summary>Colonoscopy aim investigate entire colon advance colonoscope tip rectum cecum , process call cecal intubation . Cecal intubation may difficult different reason , feature colonoscope use image device may influence success rate . We want compare performance new colonoscope novel feature include gradual stiffness colonoscope supply magnetic endoscope imaging ( MEI ) device . The hypothesis performance new instrument non-inferior MEI system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ColoAssist vs. MEI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The recommended cecal intubation rate colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screen 95 % . The MEI system allow real time monitor colonoscope position within colon consider useful supplement achieve cecal intubation . However , MEI system costly , trial result equivocal regard actual benefit . A newly design colonoscope ( ColoAssist ) gradual stiffness throughout colonoscope shaft develop improve insertability . We want investigate achieve equal performance result ColoAssist instrument MEI system CRC screening . The study design two-center , single-blinded , randomize , control non-inferiority trial .</detailed_description>
