	<brief_summary>Bronchopulmonary dysplasia ( BPD ) one important morbidity preterm infant high incidence significant impact resource utilization long-term outcome . Systemic corticosteroid show effective prevention BPD potent anti-inflammatory effect serious concern potential detrimental effect neurodevelopment infant . In contrast , inhaled corticosteroid administer ventilated infant think safer due topical effect show improve outcome include BPD . To date , study evaluate effect inhale corticosteroid administer non-ventilated infant prevention BPD . Hence , conduct double-blind randomize control pilot trial examine impact inhale budesonide non-ventilated infant . The study objective , cohort preterm infant sign early BPD : 1 ) evaluate effect aerosolize budesonide 'days supplemental oxygen ' , 2 ) gain estimate impact BPD 3 ) ass safety intervention small cohort preterm infant . This single-center randomized double-blind control pilot trial . We recruit total 50 infant bear less 30 week gestation continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) fraction inspire oxygen ≥25 % day 14 life later . Inhaled budesonide 1mg ( intervention group ) normal saline ( placebo ) administer three time day infant need CPAP supplemental oxygen reach 36+0/7 week correct gestational age . We evaluate 'days supplemental oxygen ' , BPD , re-intubation rate , day mechanical ventilation day CPAP well adverse outcome . The prevention BPD would significant positive impact patient quality life medical resource utilization cost . The study hypothesis inhale budesonide non-ventilated infant early sign BPD reduce 'days supplemental oxygen ' indicate positive effect prevention BPD . The result pilot study might also justify support proceed large confirmatory study evaluate effect intervention BPD , estimate impact BPD gain pilot trial may use calculate sample size .</brief_summary>
