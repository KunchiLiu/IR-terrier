	<brief_title>Conservative Non-Invasive Versus Routine Invasive Management Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery Patients With Non ST Elevation Elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) surgery commonly perform NHS worldwide base historical evidence benefit medical therapy recent evidence benefit percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . According national audit data Society Cardiothoracic Surgeons British Cardiovascular Intervention Society , 1 million CABG operation perform UK , 20,000 - 25,000 operation perform annually since 1994 . Although number isolated CABG operation perform annually fall slightly ( e.g . 17,822 2010 ) , CABG combine valve surgery increase . Since 5 year survival rate CABG approximately 90 % , several hundred thousand patient prior CABG likely alive UK . However , occlusive vein graft disease affect around 10 % patient within 12 month surgery affect least two third patient 10 year . Furthermore , disease native coronary artery may also deteriorate . Consequently , even though vein graft occlusion may initially subclinical , angina eventually recurs patient repeat revascularisation ( almost always PCI ) require nearly two third patient 12 year . Furthermore , PCI perform patient clinical outcomes long term poor restenosis . Given large number CABG survivor UK , complexities clinical management , cardiac morbidity mortality increase challenge NHS hospital . Chest pain common reason hospital admission UK 1 10 hospital admission suspect acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) history prior CABG non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome ( NSTE-ACS ) patient prior CABG spend time hospital without history CABG . According Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project ( MINAP ) , 47,162 patient admit NSTE-ACS England Wales 2009/2010 include approximately 5000 patient prior CABG . The median 30-day death rate NSTE-ACS patient UK 2009/2010 approximately 7.5 % clinical outcome CABG patient much bad patient without prior CABG . However , since prior CABG status independent predictor mortality , prognostic determinant multifactorial strongly influenced age co-morbidity . There important lack evidence inform clinical decision make symptomatic CABG patient hospitalise NSTE-ACS . Firstly , clinical trial treatment strategy ACS exclude patient prior CABG . The pivotal clinical trial specifically compare invasive versus conservative management unstable coronary syndrome , include Thrombolysis Myocardial Infarction ( TIMI ) IIIb , Fragmin Instability Coronary Artery Disease ( FRISC ) II , Treat Angina With Aggrastat Determine Cost Therapy With Invasive Conservative Strategy ( TACTICS ) -TIMI 18 , Randomized Intervention Treatment Angina ( RITA ) 3 , exclude patient prior CABG , mean evidence lack treatment strategy appropriate patient group . In absence trial data , guideline clinician base observational study , subgroup analysis expert opinion ( level evidence C ) . According UK National Institute Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) Clinical Guideline 94 , `` absence research , consensus expert opinion best achieve . '' Although CABG patient acute ischaemia often manage invasively , angiography commonly lead revascularisation . PCI , even repeat CABG , technically challenge , complication common long term outcomes poor . This especially case repeat PCI vein graft . Overall , invasive management patient prior CABG technically challenge health outcome influence effectiveness procedure complication ( safety ) . Procedural success harder achieve advance native coronary graft disease co-morbidity meaning procedure less often success risk complication adverse event ( e.g . stroke ) three-four fold high average . Since internal mammary graft almost always patent , redo surgery rarely perform sternotomy may damage mammary graft ( life-threatening complication ) current guideline recommend PCI unless mammary graft occlude . The effectiveness routine invasive approach every-day clinical practice , approach many clinician , call question acute long term outcomes much bad patient without prior CABG . PCI redo CABG carry four-fold high risk death compare index procedure complication associate PCI include bleed , stroke contrast nephropathy . Redo CABG confers much high risk percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . Overall , increased age co-morbidity common key driver long-term outcome . Outcomes PCI vein graft native vessel disease poor . For example , Wales , 161 patient PCI CABG , adverse cardiac event occur 14 % 13 month ( mainly relate repeat PCI ( 12 % ) . In UK overall , 33,652 PCIs perform 1999/2000 , 907 ( 2.7 % ) perform patient prior CABG . Only 1 10 procedure report successful 1.3 % 1.0 % patient experience in-hospital MI death . Ten year ( 2009/2010 ) , 8.4 % patient undergoing PCI history prior CABG procedure-related outcome remain disappointingly similar ( 1 10 procedure unsuccessful , in-hospital death rate ( 1.0 % ) , 30-day mortality 1.5 % ) . By contrast , efficacy contemporary optimal medical therapy patient prior CABG least good patient without prior CABG . Furthermore , medical therapy associate procedure-related complication potentially may safer invasive management . In contrast revascularisation trial , patient prior CABG usually exclude contemporary drug trial ( e.g . PLATO ) evidence secondary prevention medical therapy patient prior CABG reasonably robust . In fact , therapeutic trial specifically focus post-CABG patient show statin therapy attenuate graft disease progression improve patient outcome . In ACS patient prior CABG , health outcome also improve treatment contemporary anti-platelet drug therapy . New evidence-based medicine continue emerge include potent anti-platelet drug ticagrelor prasugrel safe anti-coagulants , fondaparinux . Our strategy also predicate use optimal anti-ischaemic therapy , include novel drug ivabradine , clinically appropriate . PRACTICES AND UNCERTAINITIES ASSOCIATED WITH MANAGEMENT OF CABG PATIENTS WITH ACUTE ISCHEMIA : Since patient prior CABG acute NSTE-ACS intermediate-high risk , patient consider invasive management accord guideline recommendation . Registries indicate invasive management occur half patient UK abroad , revascularisation occur half angiography . In fact , prior CABG status independent predictor invasive management . Use evidence-based drug therapy , aspirin , clopidogrel , ticagrelor lower ACS patient prior CABG compare patient without prior CABG despite fact clinical trial result suggest drug improve outcome substantially patient prior CABG . ISSUES AROUND THE STUDY : PATIENT POPULATION : The study population involve patient establish history coronary heart disease previous CABG . Typically , CABG patient readmitted hospital recurrent angina myocardial infarction least one year operation ( usually 5-15 year afterwards ) . Therefore , patient usually familiar hospital environment always coronary angiogram past since requirement CABG . Furthermore , many ( e.g . least one quarter ) patient angioplasty past . Some patient angiograms angioplasty procedure CABG also . ISSUES RELATING TO ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME : We recruit patient unstable angina non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome ( NSTE-ACS ) . These patient usually history self limit chest pain . Usually , pain control initial medical therapy patient routinely wait hospital cardiology ward often day time in-patient coronary/graft angiogram . Sometimes angiography deferred out-patient . Occasionally , angina recurs rest minimal exertion ( refractory ischaemia ) angiography expedite . In vast majority patient , ample time ( minimum 4 h , usually &gt; 24 h appropriate ) discuss Patient Information Sheet obtain informed consent . MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES : Clinical Guidelines NICE European Society Cardiology recognise evidence base instructively inform management patient thus patient clinician preference usually inform decision-making . In trial , patient invite participate eligible either treatment option . In trial , type treatment strategy ( medical invasive ) per current practice NHS additional study intervention . Usual care diagnostic test include non-invasive stress test CT angiography may perform request attend clinician , test influence treatment group assignment randomise patient . HOSPITAL TYPE : A group hospital include provide different form clinical service . The city hospital trial Western Infirmary Glasgow Royal Infirmary . The District hospital Royal Alexandra Hospital Royal Blackburn Hospital . One hospitals 'on-site ' admission catheterisation facility ( Royal Blackburn Hospital ) hospital participate regional model care transfer invasive management regional cardiothoracic centre ) Golden Jubilee National Hospital ) . The standard clinical referral pathway NHS use trial . OBJECTIVE OF THE PILOT : prospectively gather information screening , recruitment , randomisation initial clinical outcome . Other randomisation either medical invasive management , trial essentially observational . RECRUITMENT : take place routine clinical care lead attend clinician responsible patient ( rather lead research team ) . OBJECTIVE OF THE REGISTRY : understand characteristic NSTE-ACS patient prior CABG take part randomise trial . The reason participate may due presence exclusion characteristic , patient preference , physician preference . This information important understand feasibility also whether trial enroll patient representative overall . Thus , record information registry patient prior CABG randomise follow way trial patient ( i.e . case note review , 1 year contact telephone hospital visit , electronic record linkage ) . SPECIFIC AIMS RELEVANT TO DESIGN OF FUTURE DEFINITIVE CLINICAL TRIAL PRIMARY AIMS : 1 . To determine whether strategy invasive management effective symptomatic patient prior CABG compare optimal medical therapy patient . 2 . To determine whether optimal medical therapy associate few major complication might safer invasive management , 3 . To prospectively quantify resource utilisation NHS treatment strategy , derive difference quality-adjusted life year ( QUALY ) hence evaluate comparative cost-effectiveness . SECONDARY AIMS : 1 ) Quality life ( EQ-50 baseline 6 month ) ; 2 ) component primary composite outcome ; 3 ) Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina class ; 4 ) secondary care cost . RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS : Unifying null hypothesis : Overall , hypothesise routine invasive approach NSTE-ACS patient prior CABG superior conservative non-invasive approach . For future multicentre definitive trial hope undertake , adopt pragmatic trial design . A non-inferiority trial would require large number patient ( may ethical give large equivalence margin ) , routine invasive approach prove superior conservative non-invasive approach safety health economic hypothesis prove correct trial result would support conclusion routine invasive approach adopt NHS . Active Efficacy Hypothesis : Compared routine conservative non-invasive approach , invasive approach NSTE-ACS patient prior CABG associate low rate all-cause mortality , recurrent myocardial ischaemia heart failure . Active Safety hypothesis : Compared invasive approach , conservative approach NSTE-ACS patient prior CABG associate low rate adverse event relate safety index hospitalisation . Health economics hypothesis : A conservative approach associate reduce resource utilisation compare routine invasive approach NSTE-ACS patient prior CABG . PRIMARY AND SECONDARY ADVERSE EVENTS define Trial Protocol . DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE - Data monitoring safety coordinate Sponsor Trials Unit ( Pharmacovigilance ) . CLINICAL EVENT COMMITTEE - A clinical event committee include 3 cardiologist independent research team blind treatment group assignment adjudicate primary secondary cause adverse event . The case review support source documentation ( e.g . ECGs , discharge letter , blood result ) , appropriate . The adjudication decision provide Sponsor Clinical Trials Unit .</detailed_description>
