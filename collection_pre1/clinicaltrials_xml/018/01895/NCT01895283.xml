	<brief_summary>Muscular dystrophy group disorder characterize progressive muscle weaken loss muscle mass , cause defect muscle protein . Muscular dystrophy almost always inherited disorder , far , curative treatment exist . Previous study show endurance train significantly improve fitness self-assessed muscle function variety muscular dystrophy . In study , wish investigate whether patient Bethlem myopathy ( specific form muscular dystrophy ) also benefit endurance training . The study consist two test day , 10-week training period five blood test . Patients require train , three time per week , 10 week , bike ergometer specific training intensity , pulse rate monitoring . The training period flank two test day , determine , compare patient ' muscle strength fitness level , train program . The patient condition level determine 15 minute cycle ergometer test patient undergo three functional test determine functional muscle strength . We safety measure analyze blood test , train program muscle enzyme creatine kinase ( indicator muscle damage ) adverse effect report patient weekly telephone-consultations Principal investigator . We anticipate , Bethlem myopathy patient similar rise fitness level functional muscle strength , see patient form muscular dystrophy , undertake similar training program .</brief_summary>
