	<brief_title>Endoscopic Pancreatic Duct Stenting Relief Obstructive Pain Patients With Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although people pancreatic cancer ( 80-85 % ) suffer distress pain , poorly control . Currently , medical management focus frequent use opioid painkiller ( narcotic ) associate several complication . Pain pancreatic cancer mainly cause tumor invasion nerve near pancreatic gland , certain patient pancreatic cancer , pain believe obstructive nature due outflow obstruction main pancreatic duct ( PD ) extract pancreatic secretion . This kind pain specifically mark pain occur eating . With respect , decompression pancreatic duct associate pain relief people chronic inflammation pancreas due obstruction main duct ( chronic pancreatitis ) . Therefore ; think might beneficial management obstructive pain people pancreatic cancer . Endoscopic stenting pancreatic duct way decompression appear effective safe palliative ( pain relief ) treatment pain management patient chronic pancreatitis . Besides safety , pancreatic stenting seem associate significant decrease amount require opioids analgesic drug ( side effect ) pain management , may improve patient ` quality life . There old report beneficial effect endoscopic pancreatic duct decompression relief obstructive pain pancreatic cancer . Currently , improve stent . Since prior clinical practice show pain improves , plan place stent expectation pain improve . We hope decrease need recurrent hospitalization pain control decrease need medication ( narcotic ) medication side effect , also improve quality life . Specific instrument apply research tool monitor pain score quality life pancreatic duct stenting study .</detailed_description>
