	<detailed_description>The postoperative course decompression median nerve carpal tunnel syndrome sometimes complicate pain , paresthesia unpleasant symptom , may characterize slow recovery nerve function , often also prolonged illness prior decompression , cause extensive damage nerve , include demyelination , morphofunctional deficit . For reason could particularly useful associate dietary supplement support structure physiology nerve post-decompression period . In respect , alpha-lipoic acid molecule seem particularly interesting . Lipoic acid consider powerful effective antioxidant neuroprotective neurotrophic property . Dietary supplementation lipoic acid help reduce damage nervous structure . Its action dietary supplement may positively modulate accelerate heal decompression median nerve . The aim study explore possible effect molecule postoperative period decompression median nerve wrist . Patients enrol proven carpal tunnel syndrome , confirm careful examination include diagnostic maneuver Phalen , Tinel antiPhalen . By mean randomization , patient place one two group : Group A : surgical decompression median nerve follow alpha lipoic acid , 800 mg daily 40 day . Group B : surgical decompression median nerve follow treatment placebo Surgical treatment perform group accord standard type intervention , within 90 day join wait list . Patients exclude case recurrent carpal tunnel syndrome . Other cause exclusion carpal tunnel syndrome associate diabetes mellitus rheumatoid hand secondary cause , uncooperative patient poor compliance treatment , patient hypersensitivity product one component , patient pace-maker allow nerve conduction study electromyography , need evaluate pre post treatment . The primary endpoint study Nerve conduction velocity 3 month surgery 50 day discontinue treatment alpha lipoic acid ( TIOBEC ) / PLACEBO . Secondary endpoint : 1. assessment pain report patient use VAS ( Visual Analogue Scale ) . 2 . Clinical evaluation objective ( presence paresthesia two-point discrimination tip index finger , subjective ( symptom description patient mean test Levine-Katz questionnaire ) 3 6 month .</detailed_description>
