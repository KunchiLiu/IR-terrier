	<brief_title>Long-terms Effects Simulation-based Ultrasound Training : A Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Ultrasonography become increasingly use many medical specialty last decade small less expensive ultrasound equipment become available . Although ultrasound image traditionally consider safe , use highly operator dependent ( EFSUMB 2010 ) . The lack sufficient operator skill lead diagnostic error eventually compromise patient safety due unnecessary test intervention ( Moore &amp; Copel 2011 ) . Clinical ultrasound training challenge long learn curve therefore time consume require large teacher resource ( Jang et al . 2010 ) . Some trainee may therefore never acquire basic skill knowledge need independent practice ( Tolsgaard et al . 2012 ) . In search effective training method , simulation-based training proven effective adjunct clinical training , document several study interventional procedure ( Larsen et al . 2009 , Zendejas et al 2011 , Barsuk et al . 2009 ) . Most comparative study simulation-based training , however , examine initial effect simulation-based training first couple procedure , know VR simulation train provide sustained improvement trainee performance throughout learn curve reach clinical proficiency . Large resource currently allocate simulation train many different specialty effect simulation may easily over-estimated evaluate immediate effect simulation training . A small difference number supervise ultrasound examination need proficiency may justify financial cost associate invest simulation equipment , space simulation training well teacher resource simulation training . Therefore , research question study : In group ultrasound novice , implication simulation-based training compare clinical train alone technical quality scan perform two month train ? Methods Study design This study report accord CONSORT statement ( www.consort-statement.org ) . A randomized observer-blind study compare VR ultrasound train traditional supervised practice subsequent patient scan ( see Figure 1 flowchart study design ) . Ethical approval obtain Regional Ethical Committee Capital Region , Denmark . The Danish Data Protection Agency approve store patient relevant information . This randomized trial report clinicaltrials.gov prior inclusion participant . Setting This study carry Departments Gynecology Juliane Marie Centre , Copenhagen University Hospital , Denmark , Næstved Hospital , Hillerød Hospital . Participants Participants new OB/GYN resident three different hospital Eastern Denmark . Inclusion criteria 1 ) proficiency write oral Danish , 2 ) inform write consent . The exclusion criterion 1 ) prior employment OB/GYN department clinical position , 2 ) formal ultrasound training without hands-on practice ( 3 ) prior experience virtual reality simulation . Randomization A research fellow The Center Clinical Education , Rigshospitalet , independently perform randomisation participant computer either intervention group ( simulation training ) control group ( clinical training ) . The allocation participant conceal primary investigator enrolment participant . Once informed consent sign participant number provide , allocation sequence retrieve per telephone . Intervention Participants intervention group receive simulation training use two type ultrasound simulator ( see Figure 2 flowchart simulation programme ) . Participants introduce high-fidelity Virtual-Reality ( VR ) simulator ( Scantrainer , Medaphor ) . The VR simulator provide image obtain real patient haptic feedback ultrasound probe . Participants train type simulator predefined proficiency-level attain . The selection module base previous validation study module item discriminate novice expert performance include training programme ( Madsen et al . 2013 ) . All participant provide feedback completing module . When module pass VR simulator , participant receive proficiency-based training train low-fidelity simulator ( BluePhantom ) allow participant review function , train , use real ultrasound equipment . The simulator performance assess use Objective Structured Examination Ultrasound Skills ( OSAUS ) feedback provide use framework trial . Proficiency set accord pass/fail-scores establish previous study ( Tolsgaard et al . 2013 ) . Clinical training Participants group receive traditional clinical training . This include supervised practice term apprenticeship learn follow supervision independent practice . The new resident usually go call first one two week . Local department rule dictate type examination always require second examination supervise clinician ( e.g . fetal demise pregnancy unknown location ) . Main outcome measure The main outcome measure technical proficiency two month practice . Two scan emergency department record subsequently assess blinded clinician , also access ultrasound description correspond scan . The assessment perform use Objective Structured Assessment Ultrasound Skills ( Tolsgaard et al . 2013 ) , validate construct validity study include 30 clinician different level experience prior trial . Sample size calculation Sample size calculation base previous study clinical performance ultrasound novice performance medical student , complete simulation-based training programme ( Tolsgaard et al . 2013 ) . The average difference OSAUS score group 0.85 ( 2.65-1.8 ( mean SD 0.4 ) . It anticipate difference would dilute accord literature area simulation-based technical skill training ( Smith et al . 2010 ) , simulation effect persist 3 month train difference group diminish 55 % initial effect . Assuming 55 % dilution , alpha-level 0.05 power 0.80 , total number participant need 26 .</detailed_description>
