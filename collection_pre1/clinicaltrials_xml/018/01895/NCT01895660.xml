	<brief_summary>What CHAMP Study ? The CHAMP Study multisite clinical trial fund National Institutes Health compare efficacy alternative therapy young child unilateral spastic cerebral palsy ( hemiparetic cerebral palsy ) . Children meet study eligibility criteria one three clinical site ( Roanoke , VA ; Charlottesville , VA , Columbus , OH ) invite enroll , parent provide necessary paperwork along informed consent documentation . Assignment one alternative therapy condition random . Participation study include assessment child prior treatment , close monitoring child 's progress treatment , post-treatment evaluation end therapy , well , 6 12 month later . Parents active role project , observe child therapy session engage home-based activity allow child practice extend new motor skill . There charge therapy provide . What therapies test ? In past decade , new form therapy child hemiparetic cerebral palsy develop show produce positive change individual child small clinical trial ( e.g. , DeLuca , Echols , Ramey , &amp; Taub , 2003 ; DeLuca , Echols , Law , &amp; Ramey , 2006 ; Case-Smith , DeLuca , Stevenson , &amp; Ramey , 2012 ) . The therapy name Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy ( CIMT ) refer multi-component form therapy child unimpaired less impaired upper extremity constrain ( cast splint ) also receive active therapy specially trained therapist shape new skill functional activity child 's impaired upper extremity . Traditionally , CIMT therapy dosage high - often last many hour per day , 5 day week , 4 consecutive week . There important clinical scientific question need answered effect different dosage level different type constraint child 's functional ( less impair ) arm hand . This study first directly compare different amount therapy different type constraint evaluate `` work best '' young child . The therapy play-like engage child , negative effect cast high dosage detect previous clinical trial . Who eligible : Children 2 8 year age diagnosis unilateral spastic cerebral palsy hemiparetic cerebral palsy . Children must relatively healthy , currently receive Botox ( similar medication ) , able understand simple communication instruction . In advance , treatment explain detail parent write protocol available share child 's physician current therapist review . During one month treatment , child receive form physical occupational therapy .</brief_summary>
