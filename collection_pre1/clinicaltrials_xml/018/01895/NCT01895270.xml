	<brief_summary>This application seek address problem opioid withdrawal examine utility L-type calcium channel blocker ( CCB ) isradipine adjunct BUP detoxification . This project address need improve detoxification strategy assess tolerability preliminary efficacy adjunct isradipine BUP detoxification opioid-dependent participant . This pilot clinical trial determine potential utility L-type CCB isradipine improve treatment outcomes 60 opioid-dependent individual undergo BUP detoxification procedure . Specifically , study determine efficacy isradipine reduce withdrawal symptom , crave , illicit use opioids opioid-dependent individual undergo BUP detoxification determine tolerability safety controlled-release isradipine ( 10 mg/day ) opioid-dependent individual undergo BUP detoxification . Currently , FDA-approved medication opioid withdrawal opioid agonists methadone BUP , abuse liability . Our finding , positive , support large phase II clinical trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Buprenorphine Detoxification Outcomes With Isradipine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Opioid dependence continue serious public health problem , particularly dramatic rise prescription opioid abuse . Traditional method detoxification opioids , include taper opioid agonist methadone buprenorphine ( BUP ) supportive treatment symptomatology alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonist , limited high relapse rate and/or lack efficacy relieve subjective symptom . In addition , transition individual methadone BUP maintenance limit need drastically taper methadone maintenance dose methadone-maintained individual prior switch BUP maintenance , precipitate opiate withdrawal relapse . This application take novel approach address problem opioid withdrawal examine utility L-type calcium channel blocker ( CCB ) isradipine adjunct BUP detoxification . L-type CCBs show alleviate opioid withdrawal opioid-treated nonhumans , safe effective alleviate withdrawal symptom human detoxification trial , low abuse potential . Moreover , isradipine effective several CCBs test effective alpha2-adrenergic agonist clonidine block naloxone-induced behavioral effect without produce self-reported effect associate high potential abuse . Thus , project address need improve detoxification strategy assess tolerability preliminary efficacy adjunct isradipine BUP detoxification opioid-dependent participant . The aim 8-week randomize , placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial determine potential utility L-type CCB isradipine improve treatment outcomes 60 opioid-dependent individual undergo BUP detoxification procedure . The specific aim ( Aim 1 ) determine efficacy isradipine reduce withdrawal symptom , crave , illicit use opioids opioid-dependent individual undergo BUP detoxification ( Aim 2 ) determine tolerability safety controlled-release isradipine ( 10 mg/day ) opioid-dependent individual undergo BUP detoxification . Currently , FDA-approved medication opioid withdrawal opioid agonists methadone BUP , abuse liability . Our finding , positive , support large phase II clinical trial . Ultimately , work could impact addiction field provide another pharmacological tool efficacious treat opioid withdrawal minimal abuse liability . This would shift clinical practice , establish effective adjunct regimen BUP detoxification well potential enhance transition naltrexone therapy .</detailed_description>
