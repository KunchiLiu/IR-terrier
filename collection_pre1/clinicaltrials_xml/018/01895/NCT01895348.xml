	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea common disease , associate cardiovascular disease , cerebrovascular disease , many medical condition . Therefore precise diagnosis treatment important . With drug-induced sleep endoscopy ( DISE ) , three-dimensional evaluation upper airway airway obstruction could possible . The problem DISE difference sedative-induced sleep normal sleep . Moreover standard sedation protocol DISE . Propofol short half-life , 3 minute , patient could recover quickly . In recent year , use target control infusion ( TCI ) propofol , effective effect-site concentration DISE could reach easily hemodynamic stability minimal toxic effect . In previous pilot study , endoscopy diagnosis sleep apnea could do successfully propofol TCI . However desaturation event , although EEG show patient deep sleep enough . Therefore think study propofol DISE also study drug DISE need overcome limitation . Dexmedetomidine , selective α2-adrenoreceptor agonist , analgesic effect almost respiratory depression , therefore could good alternative drug DISE . The purpose study design appropriate sedation protocol DISE use propofol dexmedetomidine , enable safer accurate DISE .</brief_summary>
