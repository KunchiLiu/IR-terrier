	<brief_title>Cognitive Training Dual-task Ability Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Historically , degradation balance control old adult attribute impairment motor and/or sensory system . As result , therapy focus motor sensory impairment . However , evidence suggests impair ability allocate attentional resource balance dual-task situation powerful predictor fall . Despite fact , study examine whether intervention improve old adult ' dual-task ability . The goal study develop effective intervention improve ability allocate attention balance gait dual-task condition . Older adult ( n = 44 ) refer physical therapy ( PT ) gait balance impairment dual-task impairment randomize receive either standard balance rehabilitation balance rehabilitation dual-task practice . Following PT , subject receive cognitive training ( CT ) , either speed process generalize cognitive training . Primary outcome ability walk perform four different cognitive task vary difficulty . Assessment occur baseline , post-PT , post-CT .</detailed_description>
