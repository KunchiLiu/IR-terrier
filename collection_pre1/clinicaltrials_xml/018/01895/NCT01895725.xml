	<brief_summary>The propose project prospective observational , single-center cohort study aim examine progression atherosclerotic alteration carotid artery ( IMT , plaque volume ) follow-up four year correlate observe change traditional novel biomarkers atherosclerosis . A total 600 subsequent patient establish cardiovascular disease least one cardiovascular risk test high-frequency ultrasound probe equip automate IMT measurement 3D quantitative plaque volumetry . Plasma sample collect tested traditional novel cardiovascular risk factor . Both ultrasound examination blood sample repeat per year ass change parameter time depend treatment modality , leave discretion treat physician . The primary endpoint plan study correlation P-selectin progression atherosclerosis measure plaque volume IMT carotid femoral artery , respectively . Secondary endpoint include correlation establish ( hypertension , smoking , diabetes , dyslipidemia ) novel risk factor ( hsCRP , P-selectin , cholesteryl ester transfer protein ( CETP ) , intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) , CETP TaqIb polymorphism ) progression atherosclerosis , correlation cardiovascular event progression atherosclerosis additional predictive value plaque volume IMT compare establish risk score ( SCORE card ) .</brief_summary>
