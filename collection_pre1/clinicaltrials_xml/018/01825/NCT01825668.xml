	<brief_title>Effect Plant Sterol Enriched Milk Plasma Lipid Levels Humans Breast-fed During Infancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis 1 : To determine responsiveness plasma lipid profile include Total cholesterol LDL cholesterol concentration high low cholesterol diet adults breast-fed infant different duration Hypothesis 2 : To determine difference exist rate cholesterol absorption synthesis adult , whether difference respond variation cholesterol intake , individual breast different duration . Hypothesis 3 : Consumption plant sterol formulation low-fat milk product favorably alter lipid profile compare control study population . This free-living , randomize , crossover trial . This trial model previously successful functional food trial investigator clinic , consistent current recommendation decrease Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk improve circulate lipid profile . The propose study include three treatment phase 4 week , separate 4-week washout interval : Phase 1 : Study diet placebo ( 240 ml 2 % milk shake ; 50 mg cholesterol ) . Phase 2 : Study diet enrich cholesterol ( 240ml 2 % milk shake ; 600 mg cholesterol ) . Phase 3 : A study diet plant sterol ( 240 ml 2 % milk shake ; 2.0 g/d plant sterols/240 ml serving ; 50 mg cholesterol ) . During treatment period participant consume supper time meal along assigned test product . Consumption suppertime meal test product monitor clinical coordinator ensure compliance . Participants ask fill 3-day food diary begin end experimental period .</detailed_description>
