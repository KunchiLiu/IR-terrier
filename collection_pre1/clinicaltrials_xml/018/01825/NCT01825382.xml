	<brief_title>Role Mobile Technology Improve Diabetes Care Adults With Type 1 Diabetes : REMOTE-T1D Study , Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , prospective , randomize , 'open-label , ' investigator initiate pilot study evaluate role mobile technology improve diabetes care adult type 1 diabetes ( REMOTE-T1D ) . We hypothesize use mobile technology ( iBGStar® technology [ iPhone® plus BGStar® ] ) result improvement Patient Reported Outcomes ( PRO ) , Treatment Satisfactions possible reduction glucose excursion , A1c , severe hypoglycemia compare routine clinical care use traditional glucose meter SMBG-Accu-chek® . This study aim demonstrate efficacy technology clinical set hope improve outcomes health care cost saving . The study enroll 100 patient Barbara Davis Center Adult clinic age 18 year randomize 1:1 fashion intervention group use mobile technology ( iBG Star ) vs. continue routine clinical care ( control ) use SMBG-Accu-chek meter . All subject follow study visit similar frequency baseline , 1-week , 1-month , 3-months , 6-months wear continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) use DexCom SEVEN Plus® system blind mode 7 day baseline ( wk0 ) , 1mo , 3mo , 6mo . Laboratory analysis A1c perform baseline , 1-month 3-months , 6-months . Routine blood test perform subject baseline , 3months , 6-months . Blinded CGM data analyze mean blood glucose value , time spend hyperglycemic ( &gt; 240 , &gt; 300mg/dl ) hypoglycemic ( &lt; 50 , &lt; 70 , &lt; 80 mg/dl ) range various index glycemic variability .</detailed_description>
