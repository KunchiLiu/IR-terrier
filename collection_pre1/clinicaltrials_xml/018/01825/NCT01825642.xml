	<brief_summary>Surgical removal prostate ( radical prostatectomy ) common generally effective treatment prostate cancer . However , standard prostatectomy affect urinary continence sexual function . Different surgical technique , nerve-sparing prostatectomy seminal vesicle-sparing prostatectomy , may limit treatment-related effect . In standard prostatectomy , seminal vesicle remove completely . In contrast , seminal vesicle-sparing prostatectomy , surgeon leave portion seminal vesicle intact . This do nerve important urinary continence erectile function locate close seminal vesicle . The purpose study determine whether patient undergo nerve-sparing prostatectomy seminal vesicle-sparing experience well urinary sexual functioning surgery patient undergo standard nerve-sparing prostatectomy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer common cancer diagnose men , increasingly manage effective treatment strategy , include surgery . Although active treatment provide excellent cancer control , issue relate functional health-related quality life outcomes follow treatment persist . Surgical therapy ( radical prostatectomy ) commonly use treatment associate erectile sexual dysfunction , addition urinary incontinence . Substantial effort make reduce rate incontinence impotence follow surgery . Nerve-sparing prostatectomy successful technique preserve erectile function sexually active men ; however , issue quality nerve-sparing , surgeon experience , case complexity continue impact outcomes many men treat radical prostatectomy . In addition , patient low-risk , early-stage prostate cancer , currently debate regard extent dissection tissue removal around prostate . Specifically , necessity complete removal seminal vesicle ( paired structure locate adjacent prostate posterior base bladder responsible majority ejaculate volume ) clear . This potentially important functional health-related quality life outcomes nerve responsible erectile function course immediately next seminal vesicle . Complete dissection removal therefore risks injury nerve , may decrease overall quality nerve spar prostatectomy . Our objective determine seminal vesicle-sparing , addition nerve-sparing , result relatively preserve post-surgery functional health-related quality life outcome ( erectile function urinary continence ) compare nerve-sparing alone select patient low-risk , early-stage prostate cancer treat surgically prostatectomy . In order evaluate objective , randomize series men recently diagnose , low-risk , early-stage prostate cancer choose surgical therapy either standard nerve-sparing prostatectomy seminal vesicle-sparing prostatectomy . We compare sexual urinary function post-operatively determine difference treatment approach .</detailed_description>
