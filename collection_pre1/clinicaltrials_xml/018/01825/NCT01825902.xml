	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Establish correlation 18F-FLT positron emission tomography ( PET ) activity , apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) value diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( DW-MRI ) , fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( 18F-FDG ) PET activity , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) contrast enhancement , pathologic response Ewing sarcoma . II . Assess efficacy detect therapy induce change 18F-FLT PET uptake ADC DW-MRI accurately predict local control , event-free survival , overall survival compare standard prognostic factor ( e.g . change tumor size ) . III . Compare radiotherapy target volume delineation pre- post-chemotherapy 18F-FLT PET DW-MRI information delineation pre-chemotherapy conventional MRI determine role advance image radiotherapy treatment plan Ewing sarcoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Establish correlation 18F-FLT PET activity , ADC value DW-MRI , 18F-FDG PET activity , MRI contrast enhancement , biomolecular assay Ewing sarcoma . II . Determine image threshold discriminate viable necrotic tumor , establish pathologic correlation . III . Assess efficacy advance image accurately guide biopsy target compare plan target standard ( MRI contrast enhancement ) vs. advanced imaging ( 18F -FLT PET DW-MRI ) . IV . Compare post-treatment response assessment 18F-FLT PET DW-MRI vs. 18F-FDG PET determine whether 18F-FLT PET ADC information accurate 18F-FDG PET distinguish necrosis non-specific inflammation immediately follow treatment . V. Estimate potential reduction acute late side effect base modified radiation therapy ( RT ) treatment volume pre- post-chemotherapy 18F-FLT PET DW-MRI information compare volumes delineate pre-chemotherapy conventional MRI . VI . Evaluate automatic image segmentation techniques 18F-FLT PET DW-MRI , compare biopsy determine image threshold expert Nuclear Medicine MR Radiologist contour . OUTLINE : Patients undergo 18F-FLT PET , 18F-FDG PET , DW-MRI week prior induction therapy , within one week completion induction therapy , week prior RT ( patient receive surgery ) , within 1 week completion RT . After completion study intervention , patient follow every 3 month 1 year every 6 month 4 year .</detailed_description>
