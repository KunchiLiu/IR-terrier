	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose ADH-1 give together gemcitabine hydrochloride cisplatin treat patient metastatic pancreatic biliary tract cancer remove surgery . ADH-1 may stop growth cancer cell block blood flow tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving ADH-1 together gemcitabine hydrochloride cisplatin may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>ADH-1 , Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Cisplatin Treating Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Biliary Tract Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity determine recommend dose ADH-1 give twice weekly 3 week combination cisplatin fixed-dose rate gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) give week 1 2 3 week schedule 3 cycle patient locally advance metastatic pancreatic biliary tract adenocarcinoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate change level intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ( ICAM-1 ) , E-selectin , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( VEGFR ) basic fibroblast growth factor ( B-FGF ) therapy ADH-1 , cisplatin gemcitabine . II . Radiographic assessment disease status 3 cycle chemotherapy ADH-1 , cisplatin gemcitabine . III . To evaluate progression-free overall survival patient locally advance metastatic pancreatic biliary tract adenocarcinomas treat ADH-1 give cisplatin fix dose rate gemcitabine 3 cycle . Patients stable responsive disease 3 cycle continue maintenance cisplatin fix dose rate gemcitabine . OUTLINE : Patients receive ADH-1 intravenously ( IV ) 20-80 minute day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 , 15 , 18 , cisplatin IV gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients stable responsive disease may receive maintenance therapy cisplatin gemcitabine hydrochloride . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
