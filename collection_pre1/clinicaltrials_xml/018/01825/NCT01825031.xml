	<detailed_description>REALITY open-label randomise trial 1800 adult , adolescent child age 5 year low CD4 count initiate ART . The trial factorial design 3 randomisation , address one potential approach reduce early mortality adult child initiate ART low CD4 , namely : 1 . Raltegravir 12 week ART initiation addition 3 standard ART ( 3-drug 2-class ) versus standard care first-line 3-drug 2-class ART ( choice accord national guideline ART initiation ) ; 2 . Immediate enhance opportunistic infection ( OI ) prophylaxis isoniazid/pyridoxine cotrimoxazole , plus 12 week fluconazole , 5 day azithromycin single dose albendazole versus cotrimoxazole prophylaxis alone first 12 week follow isoniazid prophylaxis and/or treatment prescribe screen 3. supplementation Ready Use Supplementary Food ( RUSF ) 12 week versus standard care nutritional support poor nutritional status accord local guideline . All participant receive cotrimoxazole throughout trial . The primary objective trial identify effective , safe acceptable intervention reduce early mortality ( all-cause ) HIV-infected adult , adolescent , old child ( 5 year ) initiate ART .</detailed_description>
