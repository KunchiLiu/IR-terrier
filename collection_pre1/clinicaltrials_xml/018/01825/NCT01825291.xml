	<detailed_description>Sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB ) frequently link cardiovascular disease include stroke type 2 diabetes , increase indirect cost sleep apnea . Also non-cardiovascular co-morbidities possible seldom study . CPAP treatment revers increase healthcare utilization see sleep apnea diagnosis . Previous study address cardiovascular co-morbidities SDB focus obstructive sleep apnea male population , partial upper airway obstruction . Partial upper airway obstruction common gender especially woman . According investigator ' clinical experience , woman partial upper airway obstruction especially likely severe symptom SDB . There scarce data cardiovascular co-morbidities associate partial upper airway obstruction female gender . To study prevalence co-morbidities add burden SDB ( periodic obstructive breathe partial upper airway obstruction ) , investigator apply conservative robust strategy use governmental database medication reimburse public health insurance system . Investigators analyze cardiovascular non-cardiovascular co-morbidities clinical population SDB , separately patient periodic obstructive breathe partial upper airway obstruction sleep.Investigators find concomitant disease ware common SDB . Asthma and/or COPD surprisingly frequent , also chronic hypertension increase prevalence . In addition , male diabetes mellitus female hypothyroidism general population . The result emphasize importance diagnosis treatment co-morbidities asthma , COPD , hypertension , diabetes thyroid insufficiency regardless patient partial upper airway obstruction obstructive sleep apnea . Now , investigator hypothesize CPAP treatment reduces consumption medication co-morbidities sleep apnea . Therefore , retrospective analyze 5 year 5 year start CPAP treatment medication consumption population previously use conduct . To , governmental database medication reimburse public health insurance system use .</detailed_description>
