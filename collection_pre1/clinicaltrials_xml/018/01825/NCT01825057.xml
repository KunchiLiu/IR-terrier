	<brief_summary>General medical hospital provide care disproportionate share patient abuse dependent upon substance . This group among costly treat poor medical substance use outcome . Motivational interviewing ( MI ) well-recognized , evidenced-based substance abuse treatment adapt use brief intervention health care settings.MI applicable many health-related behavioral problem , teach broad range health care clinician . However , unclear implementation strategy lead efficient proficient uptake MI general medical setting , medical inpatient unit . Primary care clinicians multiple practice demand time constraint . New practice great chance implement simple compatible exist workflow system . Two widely use strategy bring specialized practice use within general hospital setting `` see one , one '' apprenticeship model training use consultation-liaison ( CL ) service . `` See one , one '' modus operandi medical education century rely upon competency-based supervision training approach . While empirically validate specialty addiction field , less controlled testing implementation strategy available general medical setting . The apprenticeship approach require appropriate patient trainer available high flexibility teach supervision ; apply behavioral counseling approach , may see incompatible medical role time constraint clinician . In contrast , order MI CL relatively simple , minimally burdensome process highly compatible way clinician secure specialist service patient hospital . We propose conduct randomize controlled trial use mixed quantitative qualitative method examine effectiveness three different strategy integrate MI practice healthcare provider work within Yale New Haven Hospital 's internal medicine hospitalist service general medical inpatient unit . Specifically , randomize 40 healthcare provider one three condition : ( 1 ) continue medical education workshop provide background `` show '' healthcare provider conduct MI ( control condition , call SEE ONE ) ; ( 2 ) `` see one , one '' apprenticeship model involve workshop training plus live supervision bedside practice ( DO ONE ) ; ( 3 ) order MI CL learn workshop ( ORDER ONE ) . Following respective MI training , healthcare provider assess provision MI 40 study-eligible inpatient , recruit research team admission general medical unit .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>For Healthcare provider participant : Inclusion criterion : Assignment one general medical inpatient unit YNHH daytime shift ; intensive care unit exclude give morbidity patient set . Volunteer serve study clinician , attend workshop MI , possibly receive live supervision .

Exclusion criterion : Have alter mental status delirium , encephalopathy , dementia mental retardation score Confusion Assessment Method &gt; 0 since would impair provision consent ability participate Inability speak English . Most Healthcare provider monolingual English speaker , MI integrity raters speak English . We therefore capacity include Spanishonly speak patient study . Stroke ( precludes participation ) Resides nursing home , skilled nursing facility Hospice Care Receiving palliative care Deaf Unable speak lucidly Previous participation protocol An information sheet request approved subset patient subject . This due study conduct within acute medical inpatient unit , condition might limit person 's ability sign consent form may occasionally occur . This subset patient include : patient physically unable write ( i.e . hand tremor , spinal cord injury , stroke precludes signing , broken hand , broken shoulder , muscular dystrophy physical ailment prevent patient physically sign ) , unable see ( i.e . legally blind , uncontrolled type 2 diabetes mellitus lead blurred vision ) , unable read ( i.e . patient glass ) .</criteria>
