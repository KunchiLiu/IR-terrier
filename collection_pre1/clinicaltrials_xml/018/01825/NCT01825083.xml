	<brief_summary>Procedures perform sedation severity regard morbidity mortality procedure perform general anesthesia1 . The demand anesthesia care outside operating room increase tremendously pose , accord close claim analysis , major risk patient . Both close claim analysis identify respiratory depression due sedation main risk patient undergoing procedure sedation . The major problem hypoventilation detect late stage patient receive supplemental oxygen . Besides respiratory effect hypoventilation , hypercapnia also lead hypertension , tachycardia , cardiac arrhythmia seizure . The incidence anesthetize patient obstructive sleep apnea increase substantially last year along current national obesity epidemic . These patient increase risk hypoventilation expose anesthetic drug . The context massive increase procedural sedation extremely high prevalence obstructive sleep apnea pose major respiratory risk patient may , near future , increase malpractice claim anesthesiologist . The development safer anesthesia regimen sedation , therefore , need . The establishment safer anesthetic regimen sedation direct relationship anesthesia patient safety foundation priority . It address peri-anesthetic safety problem healthy patient 's . It also broadly applicable easily implement daily clinical care . Ketamine establish effect analgesia effect ketamine ventilation clearly define . The investigator demonstrate transcutaneous carbon dioxide monitor accurate detect hypoventilation patient undergoing deep sedation . Animal data suggest add propofol sedation regimen , ketamine decrease hypoventilation compare propofol alone . It unknown ketamine add commonly use sedative agent ( propofol ) fentanyl decrease incidence severity hypoventilation patient undergoing deep sedation . The investigator hypothesize patient receive ketamine , propofol fentanyl develop less intraoperative hypoventilation patient receive propofol fentanyl . The investigator also hypothesize effect even great patient obstructive sleep apnea patient without obstructive sleep apnea . Significance : Respiratory depression due sedation identify twice major factor responsible claim relate anesthesia . The high prevalence obstructive sleep apnea combine complex procedure do outpatient setting increase physical risk patient liability case anesthesiologist . The main goal project establish effect ketamine prevent respiratory depression patient undergoing procedure deep sedation use propofol fentanyl . If investigator confirm hypothesis , finding valuable anesthesiologist also specialties ( emergency medicine , gastroenterologist , cardiologist , radiologist ) frequently perform procedural sedation . The research question ; addition ketamine prevent hypoventilation deep sedation use propofol fentanyl ? The hypothesis study : Ketamine prevent hypoventilation deep sedation case .</brief_summary>
