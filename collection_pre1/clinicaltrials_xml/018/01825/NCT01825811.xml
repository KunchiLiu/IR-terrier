	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study TissueGene-C Mixed With Fibrin-glue Patients With Degenerative Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TissueGene-C biological new drug consist non-transduced chondrocytes transduce chondrocytes express TGF-b1 regenerate damage cartilage . During clinical trial Phase 2 , investigator compare low dose high dose TissueGene-C 12 - month trial 18 outpatient degenerative arthritis . The patient randomize two dose level TissueGene-C 1:1 ratio , monitor record alleviating symptom , sport activity , function knee , presence adverse event .</detailed_description>
