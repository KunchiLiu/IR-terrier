	<brief_summary>Falls elderly common serious health problem devastate consequence . Those dementia 5 time likely experience fall old people without significant cognitive impairment . Despite grow awareness use available treatment , number fall fall related injury continue increase . It important develop effective treatment help reduce number fall prevent injury . The assessment use study determine fall risk predict likelihood fall future . This study evaluate possible role Methylphenidate , Ritalin , prevent fall improve symptom apathy , indifference . Methylphenidate FDA approve treatment ADHD currently approve FDA prevent fall improve apathy ( lack interest ) elderly . The methylphenidate use study absorb skin wear small patch near hip area . The specific primary aim open label study determine use transdermal Methylphenidate ( t-MPH ) cause reduction fall risk patient dementia . The hypothesis test receive t-MPH 4 week , subject show improvement gait mobility assessment score compare gait mobility score screen .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exploring Use Transdermal Methylphenidate Reduce Fall Risk Patients With Dementia .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label pilot study ; consent subject dementia identify fall risk , meet inclusion criterion undergo 3 phase involvement . Phase 1 1 week period initiate study drug . Phase 2 2 week treatment period 10mg Transdermal Methylphenidate . Phase 3 final two week treatment period 15mg Transdermal Methylphenidate . Measurements obtain phase include : Vital Signs ( blood pressure pulse rate ) weight , Timed Get Up Go Test ( TUG ) , Tinetti Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment ( POMA ) , Clinical Apathy Evaluation Scale ( AES-C ) St. Louis University Mental Status Examination ( SLUMS ) . The primary endpoint change TUG POMA score end phase 3 compare begin phase 2 Falls cause substantial morbidity mortality patient dementia occur twice rate old adult without cognitive impairment . The consequence fall old adult dementia serious ; faller cognitive problem approximately five time likely admit institutional care people cognitive problem fall . [ 3 ] They also high risk major fall-related injury fracture head injury increase mortality risk . Walking require pay attention various environmental feature recover postural variation avoid stumble fall . Consequently , deficit attention executive function independently associate risk postural instability , impairment activity daily live , fall risk . Executive function refers higher cognitive process allocate attention among tasks critical cognitive resource normal walking . Lower score executive function measure associate dementia high fall risk . Although significant progress towards understand factor involve fall make , number fall fall related injury continue increase . Changes age demographic expect dramatically increase age population dementia prevalence , underscore importance develop effective fall prevention strategy . Recent study show improve certain aspect cognition , specifically attention executive function , old adult improve mobility decline risk fall . Particularly cognitively impaired individual , may critical reduce fall risk . Why Methylphenidate ? Pharmacological property psychostimulants , methylphenidate ( MPH ) , know increase executive function . Methylphenidate chosen study demonstrate safe use MPH treatment depression apathy cognitively impair elderly well-studied effect MPH executive function attention child adult ADHD . Also small study publish April 2008 J Am Geriatric Society , evaluate use methylphenidate reduce fall risk among community live old adult . The study conclude among study subject receive methylphenidate , significant improvement mobility gait assessment observe well drug tolerability . The basis study explore pharmacotherapeutic role Transdermal-MPH reduce fall risk dementia patient . Mobility gait assessment performance strongly correlate fall risk . Therefore use subject 's score , medication administration measure response evaluate use fall prevention strategy .</detailed_description>
