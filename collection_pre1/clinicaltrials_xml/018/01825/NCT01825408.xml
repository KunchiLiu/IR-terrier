	<brief_title>Duration Antibiotic Therapy Part Maximal Medical Therapy Chronic Rhinosinusitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OVERVIEW This prospective randomize cohort study assess duration antibiotic ( 3 vs 6 week ) part maximal medical therapy chronic rhinosinusitis . Up 100 subject prospectively enrol patient visit Department Otolaryngology-Head Neck Surgery clinic UNC Hospitals . INITIAL CLINIC VISIT At time clinical visit , attend otolaryngologist identify patient chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS ) appropriate maximal medical treatment , include antibiotic . They introduce study patient invite learn . If patient interested learning study , study coordinator contact provide additional information , patient would like participate study , provide informed consent . If patient premenopausal woman , ask pregnant breastfeeding . If either , exclude study . All remain woman receive urine pregnancy test . If urine pregnancy test positive , patient exclude study . Thus , premenopausal female patient , negative urine pregnancy test necessary inclusion study . These woman inform use effective method birth control study : - Combined oral contraceptive - Patch contraceptives - Vaginal ring contraceptive - Injectable contraceptive - Implantable contraceptive - Intrauterine device intrauterine system - Tubal ligation - Barrier method contraception ( male condom , female condom , cervical cap spermicide , diaphragm spermicide ) - Vasectomy partner monogamous relationship Women enrol study informed failure birth control method course study become pregnant study , withdrawn study treatment decide accord clinical withdrawn study treatment decide accord clinical expertise treat otolaryngologist . - The study coordinator assign patient unique Subject ID use patient form exception inform consent document HIPAA authorization form . - The patient fill demographic past medical history form . - Using random-number generator , patient randomize receive either 3 6 week antibiotic . - The subject initially give prescription empiric antibiotics.The choice empiric antibiotic differ base patient 's nasal polyposis status : - If subject CRS nasal polyposis ( CRSwNP ) , s/he give Doxycycline 100mg BID allergic doxycycline , Augmentin 875mg BID either 3 6 week duration . These patient also receive course Prednisone ( 30mg x 3d , 20mg x 3d , 10mg x3d , 10mg every day 6 day ( 3 dos ) ) standard care treatment CRSwNP . - If subject CRS without Nasal Polyposis ( CRSwNP ) , s/he give Azithromycin 250mg daily , allergic azithromycin , Augmentin 875mg BID either 3 6 week duration . - If purulent nasal discharge present appropriate culture , otolaryngologists send culture sensitivity analysis , would normally part routine clinical care . The patient informed culture sensitivity analysis indicate infection treat less broad-spectrum antibiotic , prescribe culture-directed antibiotic . Otherwise , patient continue empiric antibiotic previously specify . - All study participant also prescribe standard care intranasal steroid , encourage perform BID saline sinus irrigation use yogurt/over counter probiotic reduce GI side effect antibiotic . 4-5 WEEKS AFTER BEGINNING TREATMENT For subject randomize 3 week antibiotic group , subject see clinic . During visit ( study visit # 2 ) , subject ask antibiotic compliance side effect . Recommendation sinus surgery evaluate video-recorded nasal endoscopy sinus CT make base clinical judgement . For subject randomize 6 week antibiotic group , subject contact phone study coordinator assess side effect medication compliance . 7-8 WEEKS AFTER BEGINNING TREATMENT For subject randomize 6 week antibiotic group , subject see clinic . During visit ( study visit # 2 ) , subject ask antibiotic compliance side effect . Recommendation sinus surgery evaluate video-recorded nasal endoscopy sinus CT make base clinical judgement .</detailed_description>
