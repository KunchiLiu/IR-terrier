	<brief_summary>Rotavirus lead cause severe gastroenteritis infant young child worldwide estimate account 600,000 death child &lt; 5 year age . However , live oral enteric vaccine ( e.g . OPV , cholera vaccine , typhoid vaccine ) less immunogenic poor community high level malnutrition poor sanitation . Rotavirus vaccine also appear less immunogenic setting need . High maternal antibody ( IgG ) rotavirus breast feed near time vaccination may inhibit rotavirus vaccine effectiveness . We propose quick study look practical way improve immunogenicity rotavirus vaccine set Bangladesh . The objective assess delay Rotarix vaccination improve immune response vaccine ass avoid breastfeed 45 minute vaccine administration improve immune response administration Rotarix vaccine . The study conduct urban Dhaka Mirpur Community , set previous rotavirus vaccine immunogenicity study successfully conduct . A total 300 infant randomly assign one follow group : 1 ) Administration Rotarix 6 10 week co-administered oral polio virus vaccine intervention normal breastfeeding practice receive vaccine . 2 ) Administration Rotarix 6 10 week co-administered oral polio virus . Breastfeeding permit 45 minute prior vaccine administration 45 minute vaccine administration . 3 ) Administration Rotarix 14 18 week co-administered oral polio virus , intervention normal breastfeeding practice receive vaccine . 4 ) Administration Rotarix 14 18 week co-administered oral polio virus . Breastfeeding permit 45 minute prior vaccine administration 45 minute vaccine administration . Blood stool sample collect infant breast milk mother . The primary outcome determine sero-conversion rate anti-rotavirus IgA different group infant .</brief_summary>

Administration Rotarix 14 18 week co-administered oral polio virus . Breastfeeding permit 45 minute prior vaccine administration 45 minute vaccine administration . Samples collect : - Blood draw time first dose Rotavirus vaccine 4 week second dose - Breast milk sample 6 week mother study group A B , 14 week mother study group C D ( see group ) . - Stool sample prior dose one day 3 7 dose look vaccine virus shed</detailed_description>
