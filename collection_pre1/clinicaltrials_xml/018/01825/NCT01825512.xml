	<brief_summary>Haemoglobinopathies group inherit disorder characterized structural variation haemoglobin molecule . Most patient affected require survival chronic red blood cell transfusion overcome ineffective erythropoiesis . Unfortunately , chronically transfused patient become clinically iron overloaded physiological mechanism removal iron body . The pathologic change clinical manifestation associate chronic iron overload common among transfusional iron-overload patient , albeit best documented patient beta-thalassemia major . The recommended treatment consist regular blood transfusion combine chelate therapy remove harmful iron accumulation body . Currently , clinical practice particularly child adolescent , criterion lead choice chelate agent include also adherence therapy , thus favour use oral chelators ( Ceci A et al. , 2011 ) DFP ( Deferiprone ) first oral chelator authorise Europe 1999 second line treatment treatment iron overload patient thalassaemia major DFO ( Deferoxamine ) contraindicate inadequate . However , despite wide experience DFP iron overload ( specifically thalassaemic ) patient , limited data available young child . For reason need additional data young child expressively include 2009 PDCO ( Paediatric Committee ) Priority List . The purpose study ass non-inferiority DFP compare DFX ( deferasirox ) paediatric patient affect hereditary haemoglobinopathy require chronic transfusion chelation . Non inferiority establish term percentage patient successfully chelate , assess serum ferritin level ( patient ) cardiac MRI T2* ( patient 10 year age able MRI scan without sedation ) .</brief_summary>
