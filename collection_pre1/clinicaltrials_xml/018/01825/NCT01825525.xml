	<brief_summary>The Olympus ScopeGuide® useful tool speed colonoscopy make less painful patient . It currently contraindicate manufacturer use patient implantable electronic device ( cardiac pacemaker ) . There evidence back contraindication number pacemaker insert increase around 30 000 annually UK , patient deny use device require colonoscopy . Participants Pacemakers Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators attend check appointment . Following ask lie colonoscope connect ScopeGuide® place onto abdomen ( clothes ) 2 minute . During time monitor irregular cardiac activity may indicate electromagnetic interference . After second device check occur participant send home . The hypothesis ScopeGuide interfere cardiac device .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE Colonoscopy 'gold-standard ' diagnostic procedure visualise inside large bowel . It involve insertion flexible instrument call `` colonoscope '' around large bowel . During insertion , loop instrument inside colon lead incomplete procedure significant patient discomfort . The development colonoscope magnetic imaging device ( Olympus ScopeGuide® ) allow doctor perform examination detect loop instrument easily . It show several study duration , patient experience completion rate colonoscopy significantly improve use ScopeGuide® . The manufacturer advise use ScopeGuide® patient implantable device due theoretical hazard electromagnetic interference lead device malfunction . Therefore , patient permanent pacemaker implantable cardioverter-defibrillators ( ICDs ) require colonoscopy deny potential benefit offer ScopeGuide® . There documented evidence risk case report study investigator use simulator demonstrate ScopeGuide® cause interference malfunction . The investigator propose experimental study evaluate impact electromagnetic field create ScopeGuide® implant cardiac device patient . The study conduct Pacemaker Outpatient Clinic Addenbrooke 's hospital team investigator include gastroenterologist cardiologist . After give consent participate , enrol patient activity cardiac device closely monitor close proximity ScopeGuide® effect cardiac device record . The investigator hypothesise ScopeGuide® create magnetic field significant enough interfere normal function device . If true , patient implant cardiac device also offer benefit ScopeGuide® provide colonoscopy . The justification research ScopeGuide® currently use patient implantable electronic cardiac device ( pacemaker implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICDs ) ) due manufacturer advice . There case report study medical literature confirm refute advice investigator demonstrate evidence interference use simulator . The number patient either pacemaker ICD increasingly annually service NHS bowel cancer screen programme colonoscopy offer patient blood stool patient test . To deny patient use ScopeGuide® , show reduce procedure duration , reduce patient discomfort increase completion rate without evidence unjustified . The investigator therefore believe project justify potentially allow patient pacemaker ICDs benefit ScopeGuide® . If investigator demonstrate evidence interference , would demonstrate lack safety patient group . Due lack data safety ScopeGuide® patient implantable cardiac device seek question current absolute contraindication impose manufacturer . The main question answer study whether implantable cardiac device exhibit interference expose ScopeGuide® . The population study individual implantable cardiac device , attend regular device check appointment Addenbrooke 's hospital . The age range 18 80 year . Those studied able give inform consent . OBJECTIVES Primary Objective The primary objective study demonstrate 100 serial participant whether ScopeGuide® cause interference implantable cardiac device . Secondary Objectives None STUDY DESIGN Summary Study Design This study uncontrolled trial . The study method undertaken 100 consecutive consenting participant . The participant require one visit . This routine implantable device check appointment . Participation extend routine check appointment time around 30 minute . Once complete study procedure require follow visit . The duration study individual participant follow : Attend regular cardiac device check appointment ( around 20 minute ) Exposure ScopeGuide® device monitor ( around 10 minute ) Repeat cardiac device check ( around 20 minute )</detailed_description>
