	<detailed_description>Formative Research Phase ( Months 1-6 ) We undertake qualitative formative study : ( 1 ) identify barrier HAART strategy currently use engage PLH care ; ( 2 ) identify access point way reach diversity PLH social network ; ( 3 ) gain understand PLH view , motivation , barrier , facilitator care entry , maintenance , adherence ; ( 4 ) examine structure segment PLH community St. Petersburg ; ( 5 ) elicit input member PLH community stakeholder concern plan network recruitment , assessment , intervention procedure content . We refine protocol use intervention pilot study base finding formative research phase . Key informant interview . In-depth individual interview conduct approximately 30 person high level understand PLH community . They include person occupy formal informal role PLH care provider clinic , test program , AIDS center ; leader non-governmental organization ( NGOs ) serve PLH . Interviews record , conduct staff experience open-ended interviewing , last 2 hour , follow topic guide latitude pursue new theme emerge . The guide elicit information : ( 1 ) current strategy link , maintain , promote adherence PLH care , success shortcoming strategy ; ( 2 ) structural , psychosocial , service availability , barrier facilitator care adherence ; ( 3 ) reason PLH avoid , drop , interrupt care adherence ; ( 4 ) characteristic PLH least likely enter , remain , adhere care ; ( 5 ) access point reach PLH care ; ( 6 ) recommendation concern plan study method . In-depth interview PLH . We also carry in-depth interview least 50 PLH , purposively select maximize diversity respect gender , age , mode exposure , longstanding versus recent infection , involvement care system , report HAART adherence . To achieve heterogeneity , PLH recruit clinical community setting use PLH successfully recruit recruit PLH know care . In addition topic , PLH interview assess characteristic interaction PLH social network include interact PLH care , include virtual physical location ; way talk issue relate HIV status , may differ male female , experience care system , adherence , perceive stigma , cop . We also elicit feedback related recruitment , assessment , intervention method plan main trial . 2-hour interview , conduct experienced interviewer , audio record . Qualitative phase data analysis integration formative finding intervention planning . All interview tape transcribe Russian translated English bilingual study staff experience AIDS-related vernacular , cod , analyze key theme pattern response . Data analysis look reason PLH care HIV disease ; reason PLH adhere adhere antiretroviral regimen ; experience HIV care system ; belief , attitude , intention regard treatment hold individual among friend also PLH ; PLH talk HIV-positive friend disease treatment ; exist peer norm regard HAART adherence ; access point reach PLH care include community venue virtual site ; theme relevant intervention planning . Analysis take place inductively deductively relation study 's major analytic domain construct . Coding data occur three stage . The first stage code data participant type ( key informant PLH ) , PLH , key participant background characteristic ( gender , mode exposure , treatment , treatment ) . The second stage apply cod reflect main analytical domain ( engagement care , adherence HAART , network norm regard HAART , barrier care system , others ) . Sub-codes identified careful read interview transcript identify theme , event sequence , relationship among factor within major study domain . Creation sub-codes third stage cod process , allow discovery unexpected pattern relationship . Qualitative data analysis first summarize variability domain . We look patterned difference relationships among code difference PLH link remain care , adherent HAART . For example , look difference mode exposure , gender , experience health care system , life circumstance among link care compare . We form initial hypothesis regard reason PLH engage care others , test comparing participant hypothesize explanatory factor ( e.g . gender , negative experience health care system ) see differ engagement care . This iterative comparative process continue research team comfortable explanatory model develop . We present finding Community Advisory Committee order translate finding development intervention content include message , attitude , motivation , skill need promote entry maintenance care ; strategy skills maintain HAART adherence ; benefit care health oneself others ; handle barrier care involvement ; area intervention need tailored gender ; way handle issue may arise cross-gender communication ; development positive self-identity PLH . We also identify access point recruit initial PLH seed . We specifically elicit Advisors ' recommendation concern recruitment , assessment , intervention content delivery . Community Advisory Committee . We extensively discuss project PLH community advocate stakeholder St. Petersburg . A 7-member Advisory Committee already form , include leader NGOs agency serve PLH : Doctors Children , Humanitarian Action , The Society People Living HIV/AIDS , The Unity People Living HIV , Astra , Leningrad Oblast AIDS Center . We meet least annually solicit committee guidance project activity , finding , community perspective concern . Main Trial Phase ( Months 7-60 ) Overview main intervention outcome trial 's experimental design . The main trial two-arm randomize outcome study . A total 32 sociocentric social network PLH recruit first identify initial seeds—always PLH either out-of-care treatment nonadherent—in multiple access point identify formative phase . We enroll three ring HIV+ friends outward begin seed . Each sociocentric network expect consist approximately 16 18 individual ( expect n=32x18=576 participant ) . This estimate base size density participant ' personal network observe pilot study . Each network member assess baseline use measure describe shortly receive individual counseling benefit availability HIV care antiretroviral therapy adherence . This session `` prime '' participant understanding availability , accessibility , benefit care . The counsel give study participant , include comparison group . Members 16 PLH network randomize experimental condition additionally receive network intervention . Cadres empirically identify influence leader within experimental condition network identify , train , engage reinforce network member engagement adherence . At 6- 12-month followup point , assessment data collect determine intervention impact primary outcome .</detailed_description>
