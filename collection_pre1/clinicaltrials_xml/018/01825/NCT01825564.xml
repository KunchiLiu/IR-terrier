	<brief_summary>Replacing G tube place feed tubes standard Emergency Department ( ED ) ICU , respectively . However placement require chest abdominal x-ray confirm correct position .

	<brief_title>Comparison RightSpot pH Indicator &amp; RightLevel pH Detector With X-Ray Verification FT G-Tube Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Feeding tube placement common procedure occur ICU healthcare setting . In addition , replacement G-tubes common practice ED setting throughout US . Various practice use confirm placement , include usage litmus paper ( acid versus base ) , pH level indicator ( precise measurement ) , auscultation , bubble method , aspirate appearance , chest radiography ( CXR ) gastrografin . Review data numerous study reveal many technique may provide fully accurate result , possibly lead potential patient injury , even fatal complication . Auscultation , bubble method , aspirate appearance demonstrate provide finding misinterpret cause false assurance correct placement . Several death serious injury attribute use litmus paper verification feed tube placement subsequent utilization tube well G-tube replacement . Consequently , litmus paper longer consider safe effective confirmatory test feed tube placement G-tube replacement . Currently , gold standard verification feed tube placement CXR abdominal x-ray G-tube replacement acute care set abdominal x-ray gastrografin . This method time-consuming , costly , result increase patient exposure radiation . In addition patient resides outside hospital setting time need G-tube replacement additional cost transport ED . An alternative CXR measurement gastric content pH level . This confirm valid tool nasogastric/orogastric ( NG/OG ) verification recognize replacement litmus paper test.A pH level 4.5 less validated indicate presence gastric content . A drawback use typical pH indicator alone require fluid aspirate place manually onto indicator surface . This increase risk exposure bodily fluids medical personnel . Thus , ideal device determine accurate feed tube placement G-tube replacement one precisely measure acid ( pH ) level aspirate significantly reduce risk bodily fluid exposure . The RightSpot pH Indicator &amp; RightLevel pH Detector device purport meet criterion . Both provide accurate pH level . The pH paper encase protective exterior attach directly syringe , thus , decrease likelihood accidental exposure . This study evaluate use novel device accurately verify feed tube placement ICU care set G-tube replacement ( foley catheter ) measure pH compare gastrografin radiographic confirmation . The G-tube ( foley catheter ) place treat physician , resident , mid-level provider nurse per policy standard care ICU Emergency Department . Prior x-ray confirmation placement gastrografin , RightBio Metrics device place tube per manufacturer 's instruction stomach content aspirate . The reading pH indicator time take measure pH record . The device remove . Tube placement verification x-ray do per hospital protocol . The time radiology read x-ray document . Procedures feed tube similar , however two pH measurement obtain . The first measurement obtain RightSpot pH Indicator time tube insert stomach measure gastric pH , second pH measurement obtain one hour later RightLevel pH Detector ass whether pH change occur suggests tube migrate small bowel . Radiographic confirmation also obtain time standard care feed tube placement SLU Hospital . Relevant aspect subject 's prior history record standardize data collection form ( DCF ) . These include : - Demographics - Surgical history - G-tube place - Current medication - Any previous gastric bypass surgery GI surgery - Use acid-reducing medication past week ( e.g . antacid , proton pump inhibitor , histamine antagonist ) - Relevant medical history ( e.g . gastric ulcer , achlorhydria ) - Cost related information ambulance cost ED , cost x-ray G-tube ( foley ) replacement , cost radiographic interpretation As minimal risk device main endpoint whether device could determine placement feed tube G-tube , patient follow beyond 24 hour .</detailed_description>
