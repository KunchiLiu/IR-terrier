	<detailed_description>Aim hypotheses This multi-centre randomized control trial ( RCT ) , blind research team . The primary aim RCT evaluate effectiveness proactive telephone support breastfeed mother preterm infant 14 day hospital discharge NICUs . The secondary aim evaluate effectiveness cost-effectiveness proactive telephone breastfeed support breastfeeding ( exclusive , partial , none method ) , mother satisfaction breastfeeding , attachment , parental stress quality life mothers/partners 8 week hospital discharge six month postnatal age . We hypothesize breastfeed ( i.e . duration satisfaction ) , attachment , parental stress , quality life improve mother partner receive proactive telephone breastfeed support . In addition , qualitative evaluation perform , mother staff interview experience deliver receive proactive breastfeed telephone support respectively . Monitoring study To evaluate level person-centeredness throughout study group ( reactive vs. proactive ) , phone-calls make team-member three specify date study period ( begin , middle , end ) record analyze help coding-scheme . Telephone call tap mother consent . This procedure important order : 1 ) monitor support give person-centered regardless group ( I C ) timing ( begin end study period ) . In addition , study period , member research team sit feed support team meeting ( specific mother discuss ) staff meeting , conduct short informal interview NICU manager - aim detect possible major change ( e.g . care/staff-infant ratio/environment ) problem occur . Data dictionary Following data collect mother : Educational level ( compulsory school less ; upper secondary school , high education ) Parity ( primi multi ) Mode delivery ( C-section vaginal deliver ) Ethnicity ( bear Sweden ) Smoking habit ( smoke past 2 month , yes ) Gender infant ( male , female , unknown ) Single multiple birth ( singleton , twin , triplet , quadruplet ) Gestational age ( GA ) birth ( week day ) Weight birth ( gram ) Following data collect partner : Educational level ( compulsory school less ; upper secondary school , high education ) Ethnicity ( bear Sweden ) Smoking habit ( smoke past 2 month , yes ) Data collect medical record : Infant 's day ventilator ( number day ) Infant 's day Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) ( number day ) Infant 's length hospital stay ( number day ) Gestational age discharge ( gram ) Weight discharge ( gram ) Neonatal sequela discharge ( box tick degree severity infant : bronchopulmonary dysplasia , intraventricular haemorrhage , retinopathy preterm , necrotising enterocolitis , periventricular leucomalacia ) Breast milk discharge ( exclusive , partial , non ) Method feed discharge ( breastfeeding , bottle , ) Standard Operating Procedures Each unit keep Log-book , BST record data infant enrol NICU , enrollment date , gestation week , eligibility inclusion , assessed eligibility mother decline participation ask voluntary answer question ( i.e . age , parity , gestational age , delivery educational level ) . Data mothers/partners infant participate study ( i.e . name , phone number , address , identification code , group-allocation infant 's date birth ) record Log-book . This information , except group allocation , forward researcher charge , together data date discharge maternal educational level . Only BST unit know allocate group mother . The identification code use identify distributed questionnaire link data correct study subject . Established data protocol demographic , infant health breastfeeding fill BST member inclusion discharge . All data collection eight week discharge six month infant 's postnatal age send researcher charge . Data transfer SPSS analyze . Sample size assessment A priori power analysis do determine adequate sample size study . This study independent case control 1 control per case . Prior data indicate exclusive breastfeeding rate among control 0.53 ( two month preterm infant ) . If true exclusive breastfeeding rate intervention mother 0.615 ( effect size 0.085 ) , need study 531 intervention mother 531 control mother able reject null hypothesis exclusive breastfeeding rate intervention control mother equal probability ( power ) 0.8 . The Type I error probability associate test null hypothesis 0.05 . We estimate drop-out 5 % , thus require additional 54 mother . In total need sample size least 1116 mother ( I : 558 , C : 558 ) . The trial also powder subgroup , low SES mother . We use uncorrected chi-squared statistic evaluate null hypothesis . Statistical analysis All member research team blind group allocation ( I , C ) throughout study period analyse primary outcome . Intention-to-treat use . This mean analyse include randomize mother group randomly assign , regardless adherence entry criterion , regardless treatment actually receive , regardless subsequent withdrawal treatment deviation protocol . The specific statistical analysis use outcome variable determined distribution outcome variable . Subgroup analyse conduct SES ( low vs. high ) , parity ( primipara vs. multipara ) , GA ( preterm vs. preterm ) .</detailed_description>
