	<detailed_description>This neuroimaging study change brain function associate trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy ( TF-CBT ) abuse youth suffer PTSD . By scan patient treatment , investigator identify mediator ( potential mechanism ) recovery PTSD . Childhood maltreatment unfortunately common , lead significant problem school , emotional difficulty , physical ailment . Frequently , abuse child develop symptom posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , re-experiencing aspect trauma , avoid trauma-related situation , suffer chronic hyperarousal . PTSD inflict significant stress-related damage brain age , may particularly damaging developmental period adolescence . Therefore , effective treatment PTSD youth critical , depend part ability understand neural abnormality underlie pediatric PTSD , brain change accompany recovery PTSD . TF-CBT `` gold-standard '' treatment population however , patient continue experience symptom PTSD follow treatment . Examining neural change associate successful treatment may suggest adjunctive additional step enhance recovery non-responders partly responsive patient . The investigator assess brain activation response emotion-related task 40 adolescent PTSD 12 week TF-CBT treatment , conduct Stanford University . The fidelity TF-CBT treatment assure ongoing consultation clinician treatment co-creator Judith Cohen , M.D . Neuroimaging analyse ass pattern activation associate response TF-CBT . Also , investigator scan 30 age-matched healthy control recruit community , compare patient identify abnormality brain structure function PTSD group . Controls scan 12-week interval well , allow analysis test/retest reliability fMRI measure age group .</detailed_description>
