	<detailed_description>HYPOTHESES ( Main ) : 1 . The supervised exercise healthy eat education intervention feasible term recruitment ( &gt; 50 % ) retention ( &gt; 70 % ) participant , ; 2 ) intervention safe highly acceptable participant . JUSTIFICATION : Past trial demonstrate benefit supervise exercise program breast cancer survivor chemotherapy , include reduced side effect treatment improvement physical functioning quality life . There currently exercise intervention part standard cancer care suitable program exist community outside research protocol ( often associate strict eligibility criterion randomization ) . The propose study deliver exercise healthy eat program refer oncologist part supportive cancer care adjuvant chemotherapy expect specifically address report barrier delivery . OBJECTIVES : The primary aim study evaluate feasibility ( recruitment rate , adoption adherence ) physician refer supervised exercise healthy eat intervention newly diagnose woman breast cancer supportive care . The secondary aim ass efficacy intervention : 1. clinical outcome ( chemotherapy completion rate , hospitalization ( cancer-related non-cancer relate ) , prescription write ) ; 2. behaviour change outcome ( step per day , self-reported physical activity dietary intake ) ; 3. blood biomarkers disease recurrence/survival ( i.e. , IL-6 , TNF-Î± , CRP ) . The exploratory aim ass patient satisfaction ( i.e. , program staff , facility , ease use , park ) , healthcare utilization cost ( use medical service personnel cost related cancer diagnosis ) maintenance lifestyle change ( meet physical activity healthy eat target 1 year post-intervention ) . RESEARCH METHOD : This study prospective single arm intervention program evaluation study ( pre- post-test design ) . We aim recruit woman newly diagnose early stage curative breast cancer receive adjuvant chemotherapy 12-month period exercise healthy eat program . The intervention deliver duration adjuvant chemotherapy ( approximately 12-24 week ) follow 6 month maintenance phase . Women refer BCCA Vancouver Cancer Centre medical oncologist new patient visit within 1-2 cycle chemotherapy ( see statistical analysis ) . Participants screen eligibility , informed consent obtain readiness exercise assessment complete prior enrollment . The entire intervention group-based deliver duration breast cancer chemotherapy ( approximately 12-24 week depend chemotherapy protocol ) follow 6 month maintenance phase one year non-intervention follow . The exercise supervise , progressive aerobic resistance ( weight ) train program base past trial current guideline , deliver local Breast Cancer Training Centre dedicate exclusively breast cancer research . The group-based nutrition education session ( 2-hrs ) offer enrollment BC Cancer Agency , Vancouver Centre Campus , addition 1 hour drop follow session duration study . Study outcomes measure baseline , end chemotherapy , end maintenance phase 12 month follow . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : Participant characteristic summarize use descriptive statistic . The equivalence participant deem eligible intervention compare new patient within time frame assess term demographic clinical variable use Student 's T-tests continuous chi-square test categorical variable .</detailed_description>
