	<brief_summary>Atopic dermatitis ( AD ) chronic disease associate intense itching , affect aspect everyday life majority patient . Acute inflammation extensor/facial involvement common infant , whereas chronic inflammation increase prevalence age , localization flexure . AD complex background characterize immune activation , increase epidermal thickness chronic diseased skin , defective barrier function . In normal , healthy skin , out layer epidermis , stratum corneum make flatten dead cell call corneocytes hold together mixture lipid protein . The stratum corneum , particular , lipid layer vital provide natural barrier function lock water inside skin keep allergens irritant . In people AD , barrier function defective , lead dry skin . As skin dry , crack allow allergens irritant penetrate . Mild AD control emollient topical medication . However , moderate severe AD extremely difficult control require systemic treatment often unsatisfactory due impracticality lack effectiveness . Only three therapeutic option exist moderate severe AD , include : 1 ) oral steroid 2 ) cyclosporine A ( CsA ) , widely use US FDA approve AD 3 ) ultraviolet phototherapy . Oral steroid CsA treatment major side effect UV radiation therapy highly inconvenient patient . Several biologic medication , TNF-alpha inhibitor , effective , convenient , relatively safe therapy psoriasis , thus far show efficacy AD . Ustekinumab unique biologic medication may specifically target AD . The investigator study determine whether reversal skin thickness immune pathway involve disease treatment Ustekinumab specific immune cell involve . The investigator also interested understand clinical reversal disease correlate tissue reversal disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Ustekinumab Subjects With Chronic Atopic Dermatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In psoriasis , epidermal hyperplasia drive underlie immune activation , whether direct response IL-20 family cytokine induces hyperplasia inhibits keratinocyte terminal differentiation indirect response immune-mediated injury keratinocytes . The epidermal reaction psoriasis largely restore normal selective immune suppression . Hence , one might hypothesize similar epidermal response occur presence `` generalize '' cellular immune activation , diseases similar inflammatory infiltrate epidermal hyperplasia , AD . In fact , psoriasis AD share feature dense T-cells dendritic cell infiltrates , well over-expression IL-22 skin lesion . These disease also share similar epidermal hyperplasia chronic phase . Work investigator group show IL-22 key cytokine pathogenesis AD psoriasis . The investigator demonstrate psoriasis , ustekinumab suppresses production IL-12 , IL-23 , IL-22 . Additionally , RT-PCR investigator demonstrate mRNA expression p40 cytokine IL23R up-regulated AD compare normal skin psoriasis . The investigator therefore hypothesize ustekinumab suppress IL-22 possibly also p40 production AD lesion reverse epidermal growth/differentiation defect underlie immune activation , hence suppress disease activity . Interestingly , p40 also find significantly up-regulated non-lesional AD skin compare normal skin . Although AD think predominately disease Th2-type cell , chronic stage , large Th1 component . To date , precise mechanism sequential activation Th2 Th1 cell AD achieve remain unknown . IL-12 induces differentiation maturation human Th cell Th1-type cell . Recent circumstantial evidence suggest AD patient IL-12 may facilitate change Th2-type Th1 cytokine profile . IL-12 recently show highly elevate pediatric AD level strongly associate disease severity . Expression IL-12 p40 mRNA significantly enhance lesional skin AD , suggest enhanced local production IL-12 dendritic cell macrophage may responsible increased production IFN-γ chronic lesion potentially suggest IL-12 may pivotal role promote inflammation atopic dermatitis . Topical steroid constitute mainstay therapy AD know strongly down-regulate IL-12 expression , possibly also indicate target anti IL-12 therapy might important role treat AD . Recently , Th1/Th2 paradigm autoimmunity allergy revisit include role new population IL-17-producing Th cell know Th17 . Th17 cell characterize production inflammatory cytokine IL-17A , IL-17F , IL-22 , IL-26 . One key factor involve naive Th-cell commitment Th17 phenotype IL-23 . Patients acute AD found increase Th17 T-cells peripheral blood flow cytometry intracellular cytokine stain 26 well immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) lesion . Since IL-23 major inducer Th17 T-cells , well `` T22 '' T-cells , neutralization IL-23 could potentially result decreased Th17 signal acute AD well decrease `` T22/IL22 '' signal . Therefore investigator postulate ustekinumab AD act inhibit IL-12-dependent Th1 shift chronic AD stage well pathogenic IL-22/ '' T22 '' axis disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Are male female age 1875 . Have moderate severe AD ( determine use Objective SCORAD scale ≥15 ) history therapeutic failure least two three different treatment category list within inclusion criterion . Patients must try fail least two three treatment category follow treatment modality : Category 1 : Hydration plus topical steroid and/or antibiotic Category 2 : Systemic Steroids and/or Phototherapy Category 3 : Cyclosporine and/or Other Immunomodulators ( Methotrexate , CellCept , Immuran , topical Calcineurin inhibitor ) Patients initially respond cyclosporine sustain response drug discontinue also eligible . Patients contraindication category 3 drug also allow participate study . A washout period prior screen require following medication : Cyclosporine/Oral Steroids/Imuran/Mycophenolate Mofetil/Other systemic immunosuppressant : 4 week Phototherapy/Moderate High Potency Topical Corticosteroids : 2 week Women childbearing potential must test negative pregnancy use adequate birth control measure ( e.g. , Abstinence , oral contraceptive , intrauterine device , barrier method spermicide , tubal ligation hysterectomy ) study 6 month receive last treatment . Likewise , men capable father child must also use appropriate method birth control ( e.g. , abstinence , barrier method spermicide , surgical sterilization vasectomy ) . Patients must general good health opinion investigator . Patients stable chronic asthma , treat inhaled corticosteroid , eligible .
