	<criteria>Male female subject age 18 75 document vascular disease ( peripheral vascular disease , carotid artery disease coronary artery disease ) 2 coronary artery risk factor . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test prior enrollment immediately drug administration agree use two method effective barrier contraception , hormonal contraceptive prevent pregnancy throughout study . The subject able read give write informed consent sign date informed consent document authorization permit release personal health information approve Investigator 's Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) . The subject participate investigational drug study within last 30 day . The subject medical surgical condition may impair drug absorption metabolism . Anticoagulants , P2Y12 inhibitor , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( three time week ) drug investigator deem potential interaction platelet PAR1 receptor inhibition prohibit 2 week prior study drug dose 2 week post dosing . Aspirin allow . The subject previous history anaphylaxis drug environmental stimulus include food hymenoptera ( e.g. , ant , bee , wasp ) sting . Asthma require bronchodilator/inhaler therapy . Currently smoke ≥2 pack/day . Herbal supplement ( i.e. , Fish Oil/Omega3 , St. John 's Wart , Ginseng , Garlic , Ginkgo , Saw Palmetto , Echinacea , Yohimbine , Licorice , Black Cohosh ) prohibit 1 week prior dose 24 hour post dose . Prior history clinical suspicion cerebral vascular malformation , intracranial tumor , transient ischemic attack , stroke , gastric ulcer form bleed disorder . Prior history myocardial infarction within last 3 month unstable angina . Thrombocytopenia define platelet count &lt; 130,000/mm3 low hematocrit define &lt; 30 % . Renal function : serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 x ULN . However , subject estimate creatinine clearance eGFR ≥60 mL/min , calculate use CockcroftGault formula , eligible . Liver enzymes ≥ 3 x upper limit normal . Alcohol consumption within 48 hrs prior dose , duration inhouse study period . Evidence history substance alcohol abuse screening , include positive urine test result drug positive breath test alcohol . Uncontrolled hypertension hypotension define sustained supine systolic pressure &gt; 160 mmHg &lt; 100 mmHg ; diastolic pressure &gt; 90 mmHg &lt; 50 mmHg . International normalized ratio ( INR ) &gt; 1.5 Poor venous access ( i.e. , insufficient intravenous drug delivery ) . History hepatitis HIV . The subject undergone invasive surgical procedure within last 3 month , anticipate one course study participation plan one within 1 month post dose study drug . The subject condition could interfere treatment might interfere conduct study , would , opinion Investigator increase risk subject 's participation study . This would include , limited alcoholism , drug dependency abuse , psychiatric disease , epilepsy unexplained blackout , previous hypersensitivity drug , severe asthma .</criteria>
