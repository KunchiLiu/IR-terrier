	<brief_summary>Goals : The overarch goal propose research provide pilot data study inform FDA regard safety breastfeed infant mother buprenorphine maintenance develop guideline practitioner treat buprenorphine maintain woman wish breastfeed . Background : There increase prevalence illicit opiate use among woman childbearing age . Recently , large multisite study suggest buprenorphine alternative methadone use population . As consequence , buprenorphine likely deliver large population pregnant post-partum woman . The population prenatally opioid-exposed neonate particularly vulnerable population . Advances neuroscience , molecular biology epigenetics indicate great attention give strategy prevent , reduce , mitigate consequence significant adversity develop brain . Breast milk breastfeed offer significant health benefit particularly salient group . Today , near complete lack information regard safety buprenorphine maintenance lactation , make unlikely provider endorse mother adopt practice . Methods : Five pregnant buprenorphine maintain breastfeed woman neonate enrol . Subjects select buprenorphine maintenance postpartum period enrollment parent protocol decision breast feed infant . Subject provide breast milk time peak maternal buprenorphine level day 2 , 3 , 4 , 14 30 delivery determine buprenorphine norbuprenorphine concentration . Subjects also provide plasma time peak buprenorphine level determination buprenorphine norbuprenorphine concentration day . Concentrations buprenorphine norbuprenorphine plasma infant determine approximately day 14 life . The relationship maternal dose , maternal infant plasma concentration , breast milk concentration buprenorphine norbuprenorphine determine , ingestible infant dose calculate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Breastfeeding Buprenorphine Maintained Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study recruit participant fund trial evaluate fetal neurobehavior maternal physiology among population opioid dependent buprenorphine maintain pregnant woman . Those woman elect breastfeed approach participation study 36 week gestation . Study Procedures Study participant urine toxicology test follow drug classes/cut value : cocaine/300 ng/mL ; methamphetamines/1000ng/mL ; methadone/300ng/mL ; MDMA/500 ng/mL ; MOP/300 ng/mL ; oxycodone/100 ng/mL ; PCP/25 ng/mL ; benzodiazepines/300ng/mL ; buprenorphine/10 ng/mL ; marijuana/50ng/mL weekly part study procedures addition weekly random urine toxicology screen provide CAP study period 36 week delivery . To ensure participant use illicit substance abuse licit substance candidate institution continuation breastfeeding , subject continue provide urine toxicology test period time delivery day 30 postpartum . Subjects note discharge protocol refer substance abuse treatment counselor appropriate consequence . Data collection protocol : Upon delivery , nurse staff hospital delivery contact study staff initiation study procedure . Women plasma breast milk sample obtain study personnel day 2 , 3 , 4 , 14 30 time peak ( 2 ½ hour sublingual dose ) maternal buprenorphine level . Infant weight collect day . Days data collection determine , 2nd , 3rd , 4th 24 hour period birth infant . The 14th , 30th day data collection occur weekday near 24 hour period day . Infant NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale score day 3 , 14 30 infant NAS score collect part parent protocol data abstract protocol . Maternal plasma : Using 3mL vacutainer green-top collection tube , 3 cc blood collect via venupuncture one two study RNs , one responsible inpatient specimen collection ( i.e . mother infant hospitalize delivery ) one responsible outpatient specimen collection ( hospital discharge ) . Blood sample collect ice within two hour , cold centrifuge harvest plasma . Plasma store polypropylene tube store -20°C . Plasma collect time peak maternal buprenorphine level day 2 , 3 , 4 , 14 ( approximately ) 30 ( approximately ) infant delivery . Breast milk : Breast milk sample collect infant complete feed breast via electric pump consist approximately 5 cc breast milk time peak maternal buprenorphine level day 2,3,4 , 14 30 infant delivery . Breast milk store -20°C within two hour collection . Analysis breast milk plasma sample : Plasma breast milk sample analyze Chemistry Drug Metabolism Section Intramural Research Program National Institute Drug Abuse , National Institutes Health Baltimore , Maryland direction Dr. Marilyn A. Huestis . Infant plasma : 1cc infant blood take heel stick weekday near day 14 life . The 14 day blood sample coincident routine infant blood test ( PKU test ) possible . Blood sample collect ice within two hour , cold centrifuge remove plasma . Plasma store polypropylene tube store -20°C analysis . Other infant data : Infant weight obtain data collection point ( i.e . day 2,3,4 , 14 30 ) . Other maternal data : Maternal compliance drug treatment abstract daily treatment record . Poor compliance treatment determine individual basis via discussion subject 's counselor , general compliance determine attendance daily therapy CAP unexcused unexplained absence treatment 30 day subsequent delivery .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age 1841 year 2 . Opioid dependent per DSMIVR criterion , buprenorphine maintain , enrol parent study . 3 . Delivery 37 week gestation later 4 . Breast feed first month life 1 . Concurrent Axis I diagnosis , presence serious psychiatric illness would preclude informed consent 2 . Major congenital malformation minor congenital malformation would impair infant 's ability feed ( i.e . PierreRobin syndrome , cleft palate ) 3 . Delivery outside institution unaffiliated protocol 4 . Failure leave specimen per protocol 5 . Infant medical complication impair ability feed delivery ( i.e . respiratory concern meconium aspiration , perinatal asphyxia , etc . These individually determined casebycase basis ) 6 . Any detected maternal medical condition make lactation inadvisable , i.e . newly diagnose HIV infection requirement medication compatible breastfeeding . 7 . Infants medical condition would make study participation impossible , i.e . nonviable neonate , neonate uncertain viability .</criteria>
