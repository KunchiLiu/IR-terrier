	<brief_summary>This study evaluate two approach improve control blood sugar , risk factor heart disease overweight obese adult type 2 diabetes . The first approach participant focus weight loss via reduce food intake increase physical activity , attend weekly group session lead train community health worker 12 month . The second approach participant receive education diabetes self management , focus primarily glucose control , attend monthly group session lead study staff member 12 month . We recruit person type 2 diabetes live Winston-Salem/Forsyth County area North Carolina willing attend session Downtown Health Plaza Wake Forest Baptist Health . We measure risk factor heart disease ( glucose control , blood pressure , blood cholesterol ) calculate predict risk heart disease , see intervention lower risk great extent 12 month , well 24 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lifestyle Intervention Treatment Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Look AHEAD trial demonstrate improved risk factor control among overweight obese diabetes patient receive intensive lifestyle intervention one four year enrollment . Translating finding accessible effective weight loss program major public health challenge . We conduct `` Lifestyle Interventions Treatment Diabetes '' ( LIFT Diabetes ) . The overall goal investigate two approach improve risk factor control ; one model Look AHEAD design achieve 7 % weight loss increase physical activity &gt; 175 minute per week among minority lower income diabetes patient via 12-month , group base lifestyle intervention , use community health worker supervise interventionist . Participants 4 group visits/month 12 individual contacts/year . The approach promote Diabetes Self Management ( DSM ) educate participant regard health behavior lead improve diabetes control ; arm also 12 month , deliver clinic intervention staff via monthly group visit 12 individual contacts/year . We randomize 260 overweight obese adult diabetes either intervention , determine impact outcome ( UKPDS-estimated CVD risk , risk factor control ) , weight , cost , resource utilization , safety 12 month , transition back usual care , 24 month . The hypothesis community base intervention result 10 % relative reduction CVD risk compare clinic-based intervention ; intervention equivalent respect adherence participant satisfaction ; community base intervention associate low cost clinic base intervention . Translating evidence base , lifestyle strategy , target minority underserved patient , yield , successful , model address diabetes-related health disparity .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men woman 21 year age old reside Forsyth County , North Carolina region . Disease : Type 2 diabetes mellitus . Overweight obese : define body mass index ( BMI ) great 25 kg/m2 ( &gt; 27 insulin ) . If diabetes medication , person hemoglobin A1c great equal 6.5 % le 11.0 % If diabetes medication , hemoglobin A1c great equal 5.0 % le 11.0 % Blood pressure : BP â‰¤ 160/100 mmHg . A usual source medical care : The intervention may induce hypoglycemia risk , weight loss increase physical activity may modify need drug use treat diabetes , high blood pressure , lipid . Patients must source ongoing care . Usual source care document via `` medical clearance '' form physician signature verify MD aware patient participate trial . Able exercise : Increasing moderate intensity physical activity integral part intervention . Must able walk 1/4 mile without assistance . Able communicate English Other : Willing give consent participate research program , include random allocation either study arm . Poorly control diabetes : define hemoglobin A1c &gt; 11 % Cardiovascular disease : Clinical history cardiovascular disease , newly diagnose screening . This include myocardial infarction , heart failure , ischemic heart disease , stroke vascular disease . Persons suspect angina ( chest pain ) potentially ischemic symptom require evaluate health care provider . Weight Loss : Currently involve supervise medical surgical weight loss program history prior weight loss surgery . Age : We exclude child ( &lt; 21 year ) Pregnancy : Diabetes pregnancy specific management criterion , role weight loss via caloric restriction increase physical activity uncertain efficacy safety . Among woman childbearing potential , plan become pregnant within 12 month exclusion criterion . Women recently give birth breast feeding also exclude Serious Illness anticipate decreased life expectancy 2 year ( 24 month ) time frame intervention , cancer diagnosis treatment within past 5 year ( exception nonmelanoma skin cancer ) . Inability exercise : Patients wheel chair bound , amputation , undergo treatment low extremity infection , self report unable ambulate 400 meter ( 1/4 mile ) without assistance . Participation another clinical trial involve intervention ( ) affect component cardiovascular risk . Potential participant enrol purely observational study remain eligible . Renal disease : Persons stage 3 chronic renal disease ( estimate glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60ml/min chronic kidney disease formula use Wake Forest Baptist ) exclude . Other : Conditions/criteria likely interfere participation acceptance randomize assignment , include follow : inability/unwillingness give inform consent , major psychiatric cognitive problem ( schizophrenia , dementia ) , selfreported active illegal substance alcohol abuse , clinical judgment .</criteria>
