	<brief_summary>Many mini-invasive device monitor cardiac output ( CO ) introduce among Pressure Recording Analytical Method ( PRAM ) . The aim study assess agreement PRAM intermittent transpulmonary thermodilution ( ThD ) continuous pulmonary ThD measure CO hemodynamically unstable patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation New Method Measure Cardiac Output : Comparison With Thermodilution</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemodynamic monitoring important critically ill patient . It often use assess cardiovascular derangement , help diagnosing cause monitor response therapy . Pulmonary thermodilution ( ThD ) still consider gold standard reference method cardiac output ( CO ) measurement [ 1 ] . Its invasiveness , however , often limit delay application [ 2 , 3 ] . In last decade new less invasive hemodynamic monitoring system develop . The majority new device allow continuous monitor CO hemodynamic variable [ 4 ] . Among various less invasive technique , PiCCO ( Pulse-induced Contour Cardiac Output ) rely concept `` pulse contour methodology '' provide beat-to-beat CO assessment . This method need transpulmonary ThD calibration . This well validated dilution technique [ 5 ] . Another minimally invasive system Pressure Recording Analytical Method ( PRAM ) . Unlike system pulse contour analysis , PRAM need external internal calibration factor since analyzes pressure waveform frequency 1000 Hz compute patient 's cardiovascular system impedance use mathematical algorithm base physical theory perturbation . It require connection femoral radial artery catheter acquisition analysis arterial pressure trace [ 6 ] . This new method validate different experimental clinical setting [ 6-9 ] . Limited data available condition hemodynamic instability [ 10-12 ] . So far , accuracy reliability assess CO hemodynamically unstable patient need yet clarify .</detailed_description>
