	<brief_title>Efficacy Trial Zonisamide Myoclonus Dystonia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In `` dystonia '' , involuntary abnormal movement cause drive handicap change quality life . A particular shape dystonia , Myoclonus Dystonia , characterize ascendancy myoclonias ( abrupt brief movement ) associate abnormal dystonia . Myoclonus additional source handicap movement everyday life , distort precision movement . Response oral medication may incomplete tolerance poor , deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) surgery useful major form also invasive therapeutic operate risk totally estimate absence control study . Therefore , necessary investigate pharmacological therapeutic track present good ratio profit / risk . Zonisamide usually use France epilepsy 's treatment . It show efficiency progressive myoclonus epilepsy , seizure also myoclonia . Therefore , show efficiency post-anoxic propriospinal myoclonus . So , make hypothesis medicine could bring therapeutic profit Myoclonus Dystonia . The aim study demonstrate efficiency zonisamide severity myoclonus ( UMRS ) patient . The others outcomes estimate impact treatment myoclonus 's neurophysiological characteristic , dystonia 's severity ( BFM score ) , quality life ( SF-36 CGI score ) , also investigate tolerance treatment . We conduct randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , two-period cross-over design evaluate effect severity myoclonus response placebo zonisamide ( 300 mg ) 32 patient . The study include evaluation begin end every period ( 4 evaluation ) . Each period include phase titration ( six week ) follow phase fix dose ( three week ) . Those two period separated period wash-out ( 3 week ) precede phase progressive decrease dos ( two week ) .</detailed_description>
