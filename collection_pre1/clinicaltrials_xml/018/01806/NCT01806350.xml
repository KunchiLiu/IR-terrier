	<brief_title>Pelvic Floor Muscle Training Treating Urinary Incontinence Gynecologic Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess whether pelvic floor muscle train behavioral therapy gynecologic cancer survivor result improvement incontinence symptom measure validated questionnaire ( Patient Global Impression Improvement ) three month follow-up compare woman undergo pelvic floor muscle training . II . To evaluate whether woman undergo pelvic floor muscle train behavioral therapy report great improvement validate urinary incontinence symptom severity , pelvic floor distress quality life measure woman undergo pelvic floor muscle training . III . To evaluate acceptability pelvic floor muscle training ( PFMT ) among gynecological cancer survivor provide preliminary data inform power analysis large randomize trial . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive handout describe behavioral management tip urinary incontinence , include information suggestion optimal volume fluid intake , constipation management , measure reduce urgency spread fluid intake , avoid caffeine bladder irritant prove effective intervention trial . Patients undergo PFMT 20-30 minute teach contract pelvic floor muscle correctly receive feedback avoid contraction abdominal , gluteal adductor muscle . Patients ask perform 3 set 10 pelvic muscle contraction goal hold contraction 5 second daily 12 week also receive reminder phone call address concern review instruction 4 week . ARM II : Patients receive usual care urinary incontinence , option join train program completion study . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 month .</detailed_description>
