	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Diurnal Variation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) rare genetic metabolic disease cause mutation code enzyme convert essential amino acid phenylalanine ( Phe ) tyrosine . An absence deficiency enzyme activity result Phe elevation , high Phe level result neurological damage . Diurnal variation Phe level observe PKU patient 24-hour period . As Kuvan show stabilize Phe level PKU patient time , hypothesis demonstrate within 24-hour period observation indicate therefore Kuvan may correlate low plasma Phe variability . This study PKU patient ' diurnal variation also provide important information current method blood Phe monitoring clinical setting learn optimal way measure Phe concentration . The study last 4 week ( 6 study visit ) PKU participant 1 week ( 2 study visit ) control group . Participants require follow recommended diet , complete dietary log , undergo several blood draw , include 24-Hour Blood Assessment blood obtain 8 time throughout day .</detailed_description>
