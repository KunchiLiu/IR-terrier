	<brief_title>Uninterrupted Clopidogrel Therapy Before Elective Colonoscopy Will Increase Risk Post-polypectomy Bleeding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clopidogrel potent anti-platelet agent , combine aspirin , essential treat acute myocardial infarction prevent coronary stent thrombosis . However , add clopidogrel aspirin show substantially increase risk gastrointestinal bleed 70 % . This increase bleeding risk particular concern patient require colonoscopy . The latter gold standard screen colorectal cancer . This endoscopic procedure increasingly perform patient anti-platelet drug coronary artery disease associate increase risk colorectal neoplasia . We show 30 % patient coronary artery disease colorectal neoplasia . Management patient clopidogrel undergo colonoscopy clinical dilemma . Continuation clopidogrel may increase risk bleed associate endoscopic resection polyp ( post-polypectomy bleeding ) . This potentially serious complication post-polypectomy bleed often delay , difficult locate , may provoke acute coronary syndrome . Conversely , prolonged discontinuation clopidogrel increase risk recurrent myocardial infarction coronary stent thrombosis . There lack prospective data risk post-polypectomy bleeding attributable clopidogrel . Current American Society Gastrointestinal Endoscopy British Society Gastroenterology Guidelines recommend withhold clopidogrel 7 10 day plan high risk endoscopic procedure colonoscopic polypectomy . However , guideline largely base retrospective data expert opinion . In fact , anti-platelet effect clopidogrel last 5 day . Coronary stent thrombosis report early 7 day stop clopidogrel . There remain large gap knowledge risk bleed patient take clopidogrel undergo gastrointestinal endoscopic procedure . No randomized trial assess whether clopidogrel discontinue colonoscopy . This randomized trial aim ass whether uninterrupted clopidogrel therapy colonoscopy increase risk post-polypectomy bleeding . Irrespective outcome , trial first provide control data risk post-polypectomy bleeding uninterrupted clopidogrel colonoscopy . Unfortunately , important clinical question priority pharmaceutical company clopidogrel patent soon . The outcome industry-independent clinical trial may encourage health authority international guideline committee review recommendation management anti-platelet therapy high-risk endoscopic procedure . Hypothesis Uninterrupted clopidogrel therapy increase risk post-polypectomy bleeding patient undergo elective colonoscopy Aim 1 . To investigate whether uninterrupted clopidogrel therapy elective colonoscopy increase risk post-polypectomy bleeding 2 . To assess impact platelet reactivity risk bleed patient clopidogrel therapy undergo polypectomy 3 . To assess impact CYP2C19 polymorphism bleed event patient clopidogrel therapy undergo polypectomy Study Design This double-blind , randomize , control trial patient receive clopidogrel coronary stent require elective colonoscopy randomize either clopidogrel placebo one week prior endoscopic procedure Drug Allocation &amp; Randomization Seven day schedule colonoscopy , eligible patient instruct stop take prescription clopidogrel . They randomly assign receive study drug ( clopidogrel ) placebo 7 day morning endoscopic procedure ( refer schematic trial design ) . The study drug placebo prepared School Pharmacy Chinese University Hong Kong identical-appearing capsule , accord international good manufacturing practice guideline pharmaceutical . A computer-generated randomization schedule use assign patient intervention sequence . Concomitant aspirin therapy , , continue . Randomization stratify concomitant use anti-platelet drug . Colonoscopic Procedures This study carry two regional hospital collectively serve population 1.5 million . Around 4,000 colonoscopy perform annually hospital . All patient blood test hemoglobin level , platelet function CYP2C19 Genotyping colonoscopy . Experienced colonoscopists perform colonoscopy conscious sedation midazolam pethidine . Bowel preparation consist polyethylene glycol take orally even morning procedure together minimum 2 liter clear fluid . The adequacy bowel preparation document ( poor , fair , good , excellent ) . Colonoscopists instruct remove polyp colonoscopic examination . The location morphologic feature polyp record . The size measure use open biopsy forceps ( 6 mm apart ) . Each lesion fix formalin sent pathologist histologic evaluation . No prophylactic clip detachable loop apply immediate bleeding observe polypectomy . Intervention immediate post-polypectomy bleeding include injection therapy alone combination endoclip application , , record . Follow-up assessment All patient resume usual prescription clopidogrel colonoscopy oral intake allow . They monitor hourly hemodynamic instability delay post-polypectomy bleed 24 hour . After discharge , designate research nurse contact patient telephone Day 2 Day 7 symptom bleed . On Day 30 , return full blood count symptom delay post-polypectomy bleeding . Emergency visit hospital discharge summary scan 6 month colonoscopy recurrent cardiothrombotic event . A 24-hour hotline provide patient report adverse serious event . Study End Points The primary endpoint delay post-polypectomy bleeding . The latter define rectal bleeding , start colonoscope retract anus 30 day procedure . Bleeding consider significant hypotension , decrease hemoglobin ≥2 g/dL baseline ≥10 percentage point decrease hematocrit , requirement transfusion , prolonged hospitalization , rehospitalization , hemostatic intervention use endoscopic therapy , angiographic embolization , surgery . Secondary endpoint include immediate post-polypectomy bleeding cardiothrombotic event . Immediate post-polypectomy bleeding define bleeding time polypectomy persist despite continuous irrigation dilute epinephrine solution 5 minute . Interventions immediate post-polypectomy bleeding include epinephrine injection alone combination endoclip application . The volume epinephrine number endoclips use record . The study endpoint confirm independent blind adjudication committee . Sample size estimation Sample size estimation base assumption rate delay post-polypectomy bleed 30 day 0.3 percent clopidogrel interrupt 7 day [ 15 ] , rate delay bleed 3 % uninterrupted clopidogrel therapy [ 7 ] . Accordingly , 290 patient undergoing polypectomy group require achieve 90 % power 5 % significance level use 2-sided log-rank test ( PASS software , NCSS 2008 , Kaysville , Utah ) . The investigator previously show 34 % patient coronary artery disease colonic polyp [ 13 ] . Thus , The investigator need perform colonoscopy 1706 patient receive clopidogrel recruit 580 patient ( 290 per group ) polyp study . Statistical analysis The primary analysis base intention-to-treat population , define randomized patient undergo colonoscopic polypectomy . Demographic clinical characteristic compare clopidogrel group placebo group . Homogeneity two group baseline analyze use Pearson 's chi-square test categorical data Student 's t-test continuous variable . All P value 95 % CIs two-sided . Statistical analysis carry exclusively independent statistician . Quality assurance : Data Management Only research nurse PI access right blind database use login user name password . Subjects ' information keep anonymous . They identify study number maintain subject ' confidentiality . Quality assurance : Monitoring An independent staff perform source data verification ( comparison data CRFs subject 's medical record hospital practice , record relevant study ) .</detailed_description>
