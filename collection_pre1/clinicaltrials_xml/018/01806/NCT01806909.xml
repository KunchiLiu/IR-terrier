	<brief_summary>Background : - Adenoviruses virus typically cause symptom cold eye infection . These virus test part possible new vaccine . Researchers hope adenovirus help carry vaccine body cause immune response . An immune response body release cell substance protect body infection . If adenovirus vaccine develop , might use part vaccine malaria serious illness . Researchers want test adenovirus vaccine nasal spray healthy volunteer . The vaccine call AD4-H5-VTN . - Because vaccine contains live adenovirus , possibility participant infect people . Therefore , participant ' intimate contact must join study . An intimate contact someone participant kiss mouth sexual intercourse period study . Objectives : - To study immune response AD4-H5-VTN vaccine healthy volunteer . - To see adenovirus AD4-H5-VTN vaccine contagious spread others . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer 18 49 year age . - Intimate contact healthy volunteer 18 65 year age . - Participants must evidence previous exposure adenovirus type 4 . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . - Participants receive vaccine must willing hospitalize 5 7 day . They come National Institutes Health follow-up visit weekly first month , 8 week , 6 month , possibly 1 year . They must also avoid vaccine ( include seasonal flu vaccine ) allergy shots 30 day study vaccine . - Participants enter hospital vaccine study visit . They receive vaccine nasal spray . Because vaccine us live virus , participant may contagious virus 4 week . They remain hospital respiratory isolation 7 day , two negative nasal wash take 1 day apart . A negative nasal wash mean live virus nose . - After leave hospital , participant keep diary home least 3 week . They record temperature , symptom , health change every day time . - Participants avoid intimate contact others 28 day vaccine . Intimate contact include kiss mouth sexual intercourse . Also , participant share kitchen utensil , drink cup , towel , hair comb others . Intimate contact also keep track illness symptoms develop time . - At follow-up visit , participant provide blood swab sample study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 single center , dose-escalation study design evaluate safety immunogenicity live , replication competent recombinant Adenovirus type 4-H5N1 Influenza Vietnam 1194 Hemagglutinin ( HA ) ( Ad4-H5-Vtn ) . Determining optimal route dose recombinant platform greatly accelerate investigation vector influenza vaccine HIV vaccine platform . The primary goal study evaluate safety ascend dosage Ad4-H5-Vtn vaccine follow intranasal administration . A dosage select evaluate humoral , cellular , mucosal immune response vector insert gene . The Ad4-H5-Vtn initiate 103 viral particle ( vp ) . Once safety establish initial dose , second round test begin next ten-fold high dose . The Ad4-H5-Vtn vaccine assess three participant dosage level . The maximum viral dose administer 108 vp . In addition clinical laboratory monitoring safety , principal assessment shed Ad4-H5-Vtn virus rectal , cervicovaginal , throat , nasal swab , assessment antibody ( mucosal systemic ) response HA Ad4 virus . Participants remain NIH Special Clinical Studies Unit 2 consecutive negative nasal wash 7 day elapse since vaccination , whichever occur first ; may remain unit longer medically necessary . When safety confirm 3 participant give dosage level , next high dose group enrol . If one grade 3 great toxicity ( pre-specified grade 2 toxicity , see Section 3.4 ) least possibly related vaccine observe , group expand dose . If second least possibly relate grade 3 great toxicity ( pre-specified Grade 2 toxicity , see Section 3.4 ) observe , dose reduce one level group expand . Up 25 Ad4-seronegative individual enrol maximum tolerate dose fully evaluate safety immunogenicity protocol . All participant follow 28 day follow immunization , 8 26 week evaluate long-term toxicity persistence immunity . All subject offer receive booster vaccine 26-week visit see follow-up visit 4 8 week follow booster immunization additional telephone follow-up 6 month boost . Household intimate contact also enrol monitor Adenovirus HAI antibodies follow Ad4-H5-Vtn administration ; household intimate contact enrol monitor boost portion study .</detailed_description>
