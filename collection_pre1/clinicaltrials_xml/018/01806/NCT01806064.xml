	<brief_summary>Phase 1b : To evaluate safety tolerability determine recommend phase 2 dose TRC105 add standard dose axitinib patient advanced renal cell carcinoma . Phase 2 : To estimate PFS patient advance metastatic RCC RECIST 1.1 criterion patient treat axitinib TRC105 compare treat axitinib alone , follow failure one prior VEGF TKI</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Randomized Phase 2 Trial Axitinib TRC105 Versus Axitinib Alone Patients With Advanced Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Axitinib oral inhibitor multiple receptor tyrosine kinases include vascular endothelial growth factor receptor VEGFR-1 , VEGFR-2 , VEGFR-3 therapeutic plasma concentration . These receptor implicate pathologic angiogenesis , tumor growth , cancer progression . Axitinib approve treatment advance renal cell carcinoma , follow progression one prior systemic therapy . TRC105 antibody CD105 , important angiogenic target vascular endothelial cell distinct VEGFR . TRC105 inhibit angiogenesis , tumor growth metastases preclinical model complement activity bevacizumab multi-kinase inhibitor target VEGFR . In phase 1 study advance solid tumor , TRC105 therapy cause global reduction angiogenic biomarkers reduce tumor burden dose well-tolerated . By target non-VEGF pathway upregulated follow VEGF inhibition , TRC105 potential complement VEGF inhibitor could represent major advance cancer therapy . TRC105 potentiate bevacizumab VEGFR tyrosine kinase ( VEGFR TKI ) preclinical model . In phase 1b study , combination TRC105 bevacizumab produce radiographic reduction tumor volume bevacizumab refractory patient . Together , use TRC105 axitinib may result effective angiogenesis inhibition improve clinical efficacy see axitinib alone .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically confirm advanced metastatic renal cell carcinoma clear cell component progress investigator assessment follow treatment one one multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) axitinib target VEGF receptor ( VEGFR ) ( e.g. , sunitinib , pazopanib , sorafenib , tivozanib , cabozantinib ) . One prior immunotherapy ( interleukin2 interferonalpha immune checkpoint inhibitor tumor vaccine ) one prior mTOR inhibitor treatment allow . 2 . No prior malignancy allow except follow : adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , adequately treated Stage I II cancer patient currently complete remission per investigator ' clinical judgment . 3 . Measurable disease RECIST 1.1 criterion 4 . Age 18 year old 5 . ECOG performance status ≤ 1 6 . Resolution acute adverse event result prior cancer therapy NCI CTCAE grade ≤ 1 baseline ( except alopecia ) 7 . Adequate organ function define follow criterion : 8 . Willingness ability consent self participate study 9 . Willingness ability comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure 1 . Prior treatment TRC105 axitinib agent target endoglin pathway ( include fusion protein bind bone morphogenic protein ) 2 . Grade 3 4 toxicity relate prior VEGFR TKI resolve grade 1 3 . Current treatment another therapeutic clinical trial 4 . Receipt small molecule anticancer agent , include investigational anticancer small molecule , within 14 day start study treatment receipt biologic anticancer agent ( e.g. , antibody ) within 28 day start study treatment . 5 . Prior radiation therapy within 28 day start study treatment , except radiation therapy bone metastases radiosurgery permitted 14 day start treatment 6 . No major surgical procedure significant traumatic injury within 6 week prior study registration , must fully recovered procedure ; date surgery ( applicable ) . Note : following consider major procedure permit 7 day therapy initiation : Thoracentesis , paracentesis , port placement , laparoscopy , thorascopy , tube thoracostomy , bronchoscopy , endoscopic ultrasonographic procedure , mediastinoscopy , skin biopsy , incisional biopsy , imagingguided biopsy diagnostic purpose , routine dental procedure 7 . Uncontrolled chronic hypertension define systolic &gt; 150 diastolic &gt; 90 despite optimal therapy ( initiation adjustment BP medication prior study entry allow provided average 3 BP reading visit prior enrollment &lt; 150/90 mm Hg ) 8 . History brain involvement cancer , spinal cord compression , carcinomatous meningitis , new evidence brain leptomeningeal disease . Patients radiate resected lesion permit , provide lesion fully treat inactive , patient asymptomatic , steroid administer least 28 day . 9 . Angina , MI , symptomatic congestive heart failure , cerebrovascular accident , transient ischemic attack , arterial embolism , pulmonary embolism , PTCA CABG within past 6 month . Deep venous thrombosis within 6 month unless patient anticoagulated without use warfarin least 2 week . In situation , low molecular weight heparin prefer . 10 . Active bleed pathologic condition carry high risk bleeding ( e.g . hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia ) . 11 . Thrombolytic use ( except maintain i.v . catheter ) within 10 day prior first day study therapy 12 . Known active viral nonviral hepatitis cirrhosis 13 . History hemorrhage hemoptysis ( &gt; ½ teaspoon bright red blood ) within 3 month start study treatment 14 . History peptic ulcer disease within 3 month treatment , unless treat condition complete resolution document esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) within 28 day start study treatment 15 . History gastrointestinal perforation fistula past 6 month , previously antiangiogenic therapy , unless underlie risk resolve ( e.g. , surgical resection repair ) 16 . Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) relate illness 17 . Requirement concomitant medication strongly induce inhibit CYP3A4/5 18 . Pregnancy breastfeed . Female patient must surgically sterile ( i.e . : hysterectomy ) postmenopausal , must agree use effective contraception study 3 month follow last dose TRC105 . All female patient reproductive potential must negative pregnancy test ( serum urine ) within 7 day prior first dose . Male patient must surgically sterile must agree use effective contraception study 3 month follow last dose TRC105 . The definition effective contraception base judgment Principal Investigator designate associate . 19 . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation may interfere interpretation study result , judgment Investigator , would make patient inappropriate study</criteria>
