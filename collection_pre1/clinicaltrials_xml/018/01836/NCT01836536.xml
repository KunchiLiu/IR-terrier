	<brief_summary>Bevacizumab , monoclonal antibody vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , antiangiogenic treatment currently propose recurrent high grade glioma patient . Unfortunately patient fail respond treatment find biological factor allow discrimination potential responder non responder would helpful . As immune system play key role angiogenesis induction maintenance cancer , could serve surrogate marker angiogenesis cancer patient . The purpose study determine influence bevacizumab treatment circulate immune cell high grade glioma patient search link variation cell response treatment .</brief_summary>
