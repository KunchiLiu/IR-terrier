	<brief_summary>There three major subtypes breast cancer : 1 . Hormone receptor positive ( contain cell express estrogen receptor progesterone receptor ) . 2 . Tumors express epidermal growth factor receptor gene ( HER-2 ) 3 . Triple negative ( cancer cell lack hormone receptor epidermal growth factor receptor gene HER-2 . While effective therapy exist case breast cancer first occurrence , many patient eventually exhibit disease respond standard breast therapy , particularly metastatic setting . There therapy use treat type cancer genetic mutation process evaluate use breast cancer . The current technique use detect mutation gene breast cancer patient , treat drug specific genetic mutation , invasive identify effective diagnostic non-invasive procedure next challenge physician . This study compare ability detect genetic mutation sample non-invasive procedure blood draw , invasive procedure tissue take biopsy sample . There also concern current technique use detect genetic mutation cell single tissue sample may representative type cell present tumor body therapy select use single tissue sample may effective cancer body . This study use blood drawn participant prior drug therapy compare gene blood tissue sample multiple site disease . The study also compare genetic profile metastatic tumor genetic profile original breast cancer determine change genetics tumor cell . The participant newly diagnose metastatic disease provide tissue primary site disease via image guide biopsy . These participant also provide tissue least 2 distant metastatic site ( lung , pleural/peritoneal , liver , brain , skin ) . Each biopsy procedure attempt obtain 2-3 sample research purpose . Participants locally recurrent disease breast tissue site re-occurrence biopsied well two distant metastatic site ( lung , pleural/peritoneal , liver , brain , skin ) . Participants either multi-centric disease bilateral disease tumor sample intention provide 2-3 samples/tumor research purpose . Participants multi-centric bilateral disease also 2 distant site distant disease sample ( lung , pleural/peritoneal , liver , brain , skin ) . Prior schedule biopsy procedure participant blood draw use examine genetics tumor cell blood . The participant 8 tube blood drawn test proceed onto tissue sample portion study .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>3.1 Radiographic evidence new progressive metastatic breast cancer CT chest/abdomen/pelvis bone scan , PET scan . 3.2 Patient must ≥3 site disease involve ≥2 organ sit appropriate biopsy . Treating physician , consultation interventional radiologist need , select sit potential biopsy ( see section 5.2.2 guidance evaluable site . ) Histologic documentation metastatic invasive breast cancer metastasis distant organ site ( lung , liver , pleural/peritoneal , skin [ skin , must determine treat physician skin involvement breast primary local regional recurrence ] , and/or bone ) core needle excisional biopsy . 3.3 The subject must agree undergo able tolerate research biopsy ( y ) blood draw . 3.4 Prior chemotherapy , endocrine therapy , radiotherapy therapeutic intent allow metastatic setting . However , patient currently receive treatment ( ) , archive tumor specimen count towards require biopsy 3 tumor 3.5 Women men &gt; age 18 . 3.6 Ability give inform consent . 3.7 Normal Prothrombin Time/International Normalized Ratio within 30 day diagnostic biopsy , patient anticoagulation therapy , approval require provider biopsy . 3.8 Negative pregnancy test beyond reproductive potential . 3.9 Medical evaluation medical oncology within 4 week . 3.10 Previous current smoker eligible smoke 10 year less 25 pk yr smoke history , see exclusion criterion 3.14 . 3.12 Poor venous access ( unable tolerate largegauge needle ) . 3.13 Unable tolerate blood draw research biopsy procedure . 3.14 Current smoker smoke within last 10 year , lifetime smoke history great 25 packyears . ( One pack year equal smoking 1 pack per day 1 year ; 5 pack year = one pack/day 5 yr , ½ pack/day 10 yr , etc. ) . There evidence smoking increase likelihood detect mutation cancerrelated gene plasma DNA healthy individual ( i.e. , detectable cancer ) ( 15 , 16 ) . We wish avoid detect genetic lesion pilot study exclude current , recent heavy smoker</criteria>
