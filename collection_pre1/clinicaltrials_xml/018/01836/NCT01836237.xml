	<brief_summary>Background : There publish study regard use wound protector context surgical site infection ( SSI ) rate among patient receive pancreatoduodenectomy ( Whipple ) preoperatively place intrabiliary stent . In high volume experience , SSI rate 40-50 % within cohort . In Calgary , preoperative biliary stent placement bile duct decompression represent norm give typical surgical wait time . In addition higher associate lengths hospital stay , ICU admission , hospital re-admissions , overall mortality , patient SSI also delay , often omit , progression critical oncologic adjuvant chemotherapy . As result , SSI remain crucial devastating complication pancreas surgeon patient alike . Methods : The investigator complete randomize controlled trial evaluate rate SSI adult patient undergo pancreatoduodenectomy follow biliary stent placement wound protector employ versus wound protector use . This trial employ block randomization . All four University Calgary Heapato-Pancreatico-Biliary ( HPB ) surgeon participate plan inclusion patient schedule undergo pancreatoduodenectomy . Analysis : The investigator use intention treat approach analysis . Categorical baseline data analyze use Fisher exact probability test . Non-categorical baseline data analyze use Student test . SSI rate determine use Fisher exact probability test . Hypothesis : Wound protector reduce SSI rate patient undergo pancreatoduodenectomy preoperatively place intrabiliary stent . Potential Impact : Given tremendous oncologic , economic , psychological impact SSI follow pancreatoduodenectomy , epidemic incidence complication must reduce . The additional crippling effect refuse ( Medicare ) payment patient receive SSI United States launch technique analysis potentially reduce complication National health care agenda . In Canada , health care utilization economics always relevant ever expand area importance . It crucial investigator reduce complication SSI , regardless individual payer source .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use Wound Protector Whipple 's Procedure With Intrabiliary Stent</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction The Department Surgery University Calgary long proud tradition research surround surgical site infection ( SSI ) . More specifically , former surgeon Department Chair Dr. Peter Cruse prospectively study 23,649 surgical wound follow operative intervention . This massive study remain unmatched size single institution publication . Dr. Cruse Ms. Rosemary Foord demonstrate decrease SSI rate pre-surgical use hexachlorophene wash shave surgical site1 . They observe increase SSI rate advance age , use drain , prolong hospital stay operation , longer operative time . Dr. Cruse directly responsible confirm validity wound classification system currently use throughout world ( clean , clean-contaminated , contaminate , dirty ) . We propose carry tradition line investigation , reinforce Calgary world leader SSI research . SSI frequent costly source post-operative morbidity . They common complication follow gastrointestinal biliary tract surgery , occur 5-30 % patient . SSI associate two-fold increase risk in-hospital mortality , 50 % increase intensive care admission , 6-day mean increase hospital stay , five-fold increased rate readmission . SSI also additional highly negative consequence treatment oncology patient . More specifically , medical oncologist wait operative wound entirely heal prior beginning adjuvant chemotherapy . This delay oncologically concern , well psychologically destructive highly stressed patient poor associate survival . Furthermore , significant SSI , delay often lead total omission adjuvant therapy whole . The estimate increase cost per SSI range $ 1,300 $ 5,000 United States . In Canada , 1998 study estimate $ 3,937 per infection , result increased hospital stay , well emergency department clinic visit . The implication cost become paramount give U.S. Medicare Medicaid currently deny reimbursement patient obtain SSI admitted hospital . In addition , patient develop SSI experience psychosocial distress , loss income , loss productivity . Prevention SSI therefore vitally important goal deliver quality care patient . The SSI rate 40-50 % patient undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy intrabiliary stent , population interest study . Wound protector device design protect abdominal wound tissue edge contamination trauma laparotomy . A major reason conception use theoretical reduction risk SSI . Various device similar intent describe since 1960s , fall two main design category : ( 1 ) Those internal external ring connect impervious plastic , ( 2 ) Those single , internal ring connect drape extend outward , wind edge onto abdomen affixed adhesive clips.A recent meta-analysis randomize controlled trial conduct team lead Principal Investigator evaluate whether impervious plastic wound protector reduce risk surgical site infection follow gastrointestinal biliary surgery . Six study represent 1,008 patient include . Wound protector associate 45 % decrease SSI ( p = 0.04 ) . The Alexis Wound Protector , ring base model , evidence superiority product select study base finding . Methods Recruitment : Contact information study candidate obtain project 's research fellow office participate ( 4 ) surgeon . Patients contact prior surgery research fellow provide information regard study . Patients consent participate randomize . Randomization process : This study simple , two-arm randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) block randomization . Allocation conceal patient enters study . Patients randomize Research fellow follow consent . Allocation provide surgeon seal envelope open immediately surgery . Patients data analyst blind allocation ; surgeon blind . Charts blind data abstraction . Data collection : Information collect chart review operative report patient record research fellow Department Surgery . Data element collect include : Date birth , Sex , American Society Anesthesiologist ( ASA ) score , Surgeon , Site ( one facility ) , Fellow/resident/clerk present ( y/n ) , Surgical procedure , Antibiotic prophylaxis receive ( y/n ) time give , Information repeat antibiotic prophylaxis ( long surgery ) , Antibiotic type/combination , Type wound protector manufacturer , Prep type ( ETOH base , chlorhexidine base , iodine base ) , Hair removal , Medications give , Packing , Drains , Wound classification , Wound closure technique &amp; dress type , Length surgery , Surgical suite infection control factor ( e.g . UV , OR ventilation ) differ , Transfusions , Patient record : Current use corticosteroids/immune suppressant , Preoperative chemotherapy , Smoking history , Co-morbidities ( diabetes , hypertension , etc . ) , Body Mass Index ( BMI ) . The presence SSI determine accord guideline develop Centers Disease Control . More specifically , SSI define presence least one following : 1 . Purulent drainage , without laboratory conformation , superficial incision . 2 . Organisms isolate aseptically obtained culture fluid superficial incision . 3 . At least one follow sign symptoms infection : pain tenderness , localize swelling , redness superficial incision deliberately open surgeon , unless incision culture-negative . 4 . Diagnosis superficial incisional SSI surgeon attend physician . Analysis We use intention treat approach analysis avoid effect crossover dropout . To achieve power ( superiority trial ) 90 % , alpha 0.05 5 % crossover 40 % expect SSI rate control versus 10 % wound protector group , total sample size 78 ( i.e . 39 arm ) . Resources This project capitalize exist research team work collaboratively Principal Investigator research assistant carry project effectively efficiently . The current research team include clinical research fellow experience recruit research participant patient population project manager assist ethic application , manuscript write reporting . Additionally , Principal Investigator benefit mentorship experience investigator provide guidance methodology , interpretation data publication strategy , also day-to-day logistics run research project .</detailed_description>
