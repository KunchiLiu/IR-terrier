	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : * Molecular Biology : I . To test ability imetelstat ( GRN163L ) inhibit telomerase activity Telomere Repeat Amplification Protocol ( TRAP ) tumor peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMNCs ) child recurrent refractory HGG ependymoma . II . To characterize pharmacokinetics imetelstat plasma , cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , tumor tissue child recurrent refractory HGG ependymoma . * Phase II : I . To estimate sustained objective response rate ( complete response ( CR ) plus partial response ( PR ) , sustain least 6 week ) imetelstat administer intravenously Days 1 8 21-day course recommend Phase II pediatric dose , 285mg/m2 , child recurrent refractory HGG , ependymoma DIPG . Independent estimate objective response rate make three stratum , two histologically define . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : * Phase II : I . To assess evidence telomerase expression detection hTERT mRNA TERC RNA level quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) telomerase activity TRAP archival tumor tissue ( HGG , ependymoma stratum ) explore association telomerase positivity objective response progression-free survival ( PFS ) . II . To estimate stratum-specific PFS distribution child recurrent refractory HGG , ependymoma DIPG treat imetelstat . * Molecular Biology Phase II : I . To characterize plasma CSF pharmacokinetics imetelstat child recurrent refractory HGG , ependymoma DIPG . II . To assess evidence telomerase expression detection hTERT mRNA TERC RNA level qRT-PCR , telomerase activity TRAP , telomere length telomere terminal restriction fragment ( TRF ) analysis PBMNCs prior treatment imetelstat assess evidence telomerase inhibition TRAP telomere shorten TRF analysis serially treatment imetelstat . III . To compare incidence Alternative Lengthening Telomeres ( ALT ) mechanism pediatric HGG , ependymoma determine four different assay 1 ) ATRX/DAXX nuclear localization immunofluorescence ( IF ) assay ; 2 ) telomere-specific signal fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) ; 3 ) telomeric terminal restriction fragment ( TRF ) analysis Southern blot ; 4 ) C circle assay assess correlation method ALT detection . IV . To assess whether ALT status associate objective response rate child recurrent refractory HGG , ependymoma treat imetelstat . V. To describe MRI characteristic diffusion change recurrent refractory HGG , ependymoma DIPG tumor prior treatment imetelstat assess early diffusion indicator response . VI . To measure telomere length tumor child recurrent refractory HGG , ependymoma ass association tumor length tumor response imetelstat treatment . VII . To assess hTERT promoter mutation methylation , H3F3A , ATRX , DAXX mutation , examine effect modification child recurrent brain tumor use targeted gene , exome , RNA sequence methylation array target genomic region . OUTLINE : Molecular Biology Phase : Patients receive one infusion imetelstat prior surgery . Surgery take place 12-24 hour infusion imetelstat . Patients continue receive therapy schedule Phase II patient start 14-21 day surgery . Phase II : Patients receive imetelstat sodium IV 2 hour day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
