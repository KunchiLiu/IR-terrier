	<brief_summary>The two surgical option low 1/3 rectal cancer APR sphincter spar procedure . Intersphincteric resection procedure treat low rectal cancer within 2 cm dentate line avoid permanent colostomy , improve quality life well genitourinary function . Neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy routine T3 case .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Short Term Outcomes Laparoscopic Intersphincteric Resection Low Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The management rectal cancer change substantially recent decade . The introduction total mesorectal excision , improve accuracy preoperative stag magnetic resonance imaging , precise indication neoadjuvant radiotherapy chemoradiotherapy represent significant progress . Ideal surgery rectal cancer obtain adequate radial circumferential margin , also preserve normal sphincter function . Successful excision low rectal tumour preserve anal sphincter require knowledge pattern tumour spread understand physiology sphincter mechanism . The move towards sphincter preserve surgery begin early anorectal physiology work show distal 1-2 cm rectum internal anal sphincter absolutely necessary continence . Sphincter preservation present several advantage ; The first threefold low risk intraoperative rectal perforation positive circumferential margin APR . This TME sphincter preservation anatomical standardize surgical procedure APR . The second advantage well genital function observe low anterior resection APR : 72-90 % vs. 63-75 % . This due low risk damage pelvic branch pelvic autonomic nerve , expose perineal phase APR . The third advantage conservative surgery preservation body image may increase quality life . The goal intersphincteric resection divide rectum transanally remove part whole internal anal sphincter , order obtain adequate distal margin preserve natural function defecation . ISR use mainly Europe recently Asia . This technique modify concept sphincter preservation , permit theoretically avoid APR rectal cancer due possibility obtain safe distal margin case . Series intersphincteric resection confirm safety procedure 1.6 % mortality , 10 % anastomotic leak , 9 % local recurrence 81 % 5-year survival pool analysis 612 patient treat 13 unit ISR T2 T3 low rectal cancer . Preoperative chemoradiation therapy widely use treat locally advanced rectal cancer increase resectability , enhance sphincter preservation , local control possibly , survival rate . Surgery perform six eight week radiotherapy . The exact level transection internal sphincter decide radiation accord distance anal verge , order avoid underestimation irradiate tumor potential risk tumour transection . The advent minimally invasive surgical technique give surgeon option laparoscopic approach . Recently , clinical outcome intersphincteric resection ( ISR ) laparoscopic approach ( laparoscopic ISR ) report , laparoscopic ISR patient bulky low rectal cancer remain challenge particularly T3 tumor patient narrow pelvis , difficulty understand accurate anatomy small pelvic cavity , dissect TME tumour specific mesorectal excision ( TSME ) plane , transect low rectum safely . Total mesorectal excision ( TME ) , negative circumferential margin ( CFM ) , tumor free surgical margin prerequisite regardless approach ISR . Current evidence suggest local recurrence , lymph node harvest oncological clearance laparoscopic rectal resection compromise may equivalent open surgery . Moreover , Numerous study demonstrate laparoscopic technique many advantage colorectal surgery compare open surgery .</detailed_description>
