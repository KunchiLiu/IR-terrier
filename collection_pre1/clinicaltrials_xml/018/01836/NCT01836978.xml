	<brief_summary>The process enhance functional capacity individual operation enable withstand stress surgery term prehabilitation . It show poor baseline capacity physical performance poor nutritional status increase risk complication major non cardiac surgery prolong recovery . A controlled randomized study patient undergo radical cystectomy cancer therefore propose determine impact multimodal prehabilitation functional exercise capacity functional recovery . Patients accept enrol study randomize either group receive multimodal intervention include nutritional supplementation ( Immunocal® whey protein ) combine physical exercise program stress reduction strategy surgery , control group receive standard preoperative treatment per institution .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prehabilitation Enhance Postoperative Functional Capacity Following Radical Cystectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Arms 1 . Standard group Patients group follow standard MUHC clinical guideline . This group receive general instruction exercise ( breathe , ankle rotation ) do surgery preoperative clinic nurse . They also see nutritionist provide general counseling healthy eating . 2 . Prehabilitation group Patients group follow multimodal protocol consist nutritional supplementation , specific physical exercise program stress reduction strategy . Randomization Patients assign two group use computer-generated randomization process whereby brown seal envelope prepare open patient ' consent sign . Components prehabilitation 1 . Nutritional supplementation The nutritional status patient affect bladder cancer directly influence presence cancer impact aspects intermediary ( protein , carbohydrate , lipid , trace element , vitamin ) metabolism , factor age , adjuvant cancer therapy stage disease . In addition , patient undernourish surgery great risk morbidity mortality . The primary goal nutrition therapy perioperative period thus optimize nutrient store pre-operatively provide adequate nutrition compensate catabolic response surgery postoperatively . This include preventing loss lean body mass inversely correlate survival critically ill patient . The patient ' nutritional status adequacy dietary intake assess nutritionist use three day food record Subjective Global Assessment tool . Percentage lean body mass fat measure bioelectrical impedance . Serum albumin also measure . All patient prehabilitation group provide whey protein supplement ( Immunocal® , Immunotec Inc. ) provide strategy optimize dietary energy protein intake . The quantity supplement patient require consume daily depend estimate deficit dietary protein intake . This determine base difference usual protein intake protein requirement , assessed nutritionist baseline assessment . Patients control group receive general instruction healthy eating . Compliance monitor weekly phone call study coordinator . The patient also ask complete journal detail quantity nutritional supplement consume day . 2 . Physical exercise program It show prehabilitation improve postoperative physical function cancer patient undergo colorectal surgery lung resection , change associate improvement mental health , vitality , self-perceived health . Moreover , appear subject whose fitness deteriorate preoperatively surgical complication require intensive care . A recently publish systematic review preoperative physical exercise Valkenet et al report less postoperative complication shorter length stay abdominal surgery patient . Although role exercise intensity unclear , appear moderate exercise , carry combination aerobic resistance training component , sufficient build adequate physiological reserve energy , even patient receive chemotherapy . The exercise component consist approximately 60 min resistance aerobic training , minimum 3 day per week . The exercise program individualize base upon baseline fitness test ( accord American College Sport Medicine , ACMS , standard ) include : 5 min warm-up , either 25 min aerobic exercise ( start 30- 40 % heart rate reserve , HRR ) , 25 min resistance training ( 8 exercise target major muscle group perform moderate intensity ) , 5-10 min cool-down stretching period . All exercise clearly explain demonstrated kinesiologist baseline . Patients ask carry program home , unsupervised , monitored weekly telephone call . Training intensity progression occur participant complete aerobic exercise mild exertion and/or participant complete 15 repetition give resistance exercise . Participants provide resistance band exercise mat , well pedometer heart rate monitor , use participant monitor progress kinesiologist monitor daily compliance . A log book also complete report activity frequency exercise complete . The kinesiologist follow participant weekly basis ensure program compliance address barrier may prevent ongoing participation . The control group receive general instruction exercise hospital stay bed , walk sit . C. Anxiety reduction strategy . It expect patient undergo bladder surgery cancer anxious depress . The control group receive general instruction preoperative clinic perioperative care breathe exercise , prehabilitation group see psychologist coordinator provide different strategy deal anxiety depression ( guided imagery , relaxation , visualization , yoga ) .</detailed_description>
