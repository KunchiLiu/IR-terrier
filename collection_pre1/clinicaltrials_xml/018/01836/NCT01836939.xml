	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness CNDO 201Trichuris suis ovum ( TSO ) treatment moderate severe plaque psoriasis . Psoriasis driven T-cell infiltration epidermis . The T-cells involved psoriasis exhibit Th17-like Th1-like cytokine secretion profile . This excess Th17/Th1 response think play critical role development psoriasis , reduce Th17/Th1 activity would potential way halt inflammatory process lead psoriasis .</detailed_description>
