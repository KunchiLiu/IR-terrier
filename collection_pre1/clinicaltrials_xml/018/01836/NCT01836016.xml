	<brief_title>A Randomized Comparative Effectiveness Research Trial Three Treatments COPD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>COPD affect million worldwide . The high prevalence , morbidity , mortality economic burden COPD increase steadily . Although many therapy exist develop relieve symptom reduce mortality COPD , study placebo-controlled efficacy study highly select population . There clinical trial compare therapeutic alternative real world . Much comparative research evidence COPD base observational study . Furthermore , study real world population COPD receive different therapy efficacy evidence find wide variation care delivery . These consideration highlight need identify effective therapy real world COPD patient design test effort translate evidence healthcare million COPD patient . In short , need comparative effectiveness research ( CER ) COPD . CER receive grow attention worldwide . The direct comparison treatment alternative provide CER help patient provider make best informed treatment decision evidence previously lack . Some randomize controlled trial comprehensive Traditional Chinese medicine ( TCM ) intervention , especially base TCM pattern , certain evidence show definite effect stable COPD patient . When face many treatment approach , choose suitable treatment difficult identify . Hence , aim study compare effectiveness economic evaluation three treatment COPD patient determine treatment suitable COPD patient . conventional medicine , TCM treatment Combination conventional medicine TCM treatment . This multi-center , pragmatic , randomize , control trial evaluate effectiveness three treatment COPD subject . Following 14 day run-in period , approximately 360 subject randomly assign one three treatment ( conventional medicine , Traditional Chinese medicine , combination conventional medicine TCM treatment ) 26 week . After 26 week treatment period , subject three treatment arm follow-up 26 week . The primary outcome measure frequency exacerbation . . Secondary efficacy measure include FEV1 , Dyspnea ( MMRC ) , Exercise Capacity ( 6MWD ) , Quality life ( CAT ) economic evaluation ( CEA , CUA ) . Safety assess collection adverse event . There total 5 study visit ( baseline , 13 , 26 week treatment , 13 26 week follow-up ) . A follow-up contact collection effect economic evaluation conduct approximately 26 week follow last study visit .</detailed_description>
