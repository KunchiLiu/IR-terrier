	<detailed_description>Home Monitoring remotely provide continuous trend potential HF-related variable sample interval 24 hour . Although predictive value individual variable may limit , proper combination variable 24-hour sampling may allow develop HM diagnostic algorithm accurately predict HF worsening within give time window . The objective Study select predictive variable likely effectively include future algorithm . This multicentre , exploratory Study objective prospectively collect follow-up Home Monitoring data population subject indication ICD and/or CRT-D implantation , document HF hospitalization death correlate event HM data identify combination HM data great sensitivity specificity predict HF event . Fifty first hospitalization worsen HF ( adjudicate independent board ) necessary reach study objective ( Event driven study ) , initially assume generated 650 patient fulfil inclusion exclusion criterion . Sample size estimation review interim analysis .</detailed_description>
