	<brief_summary>The purpose study measure intrahepatic HCV RNA level time liver transplantation patient receive antiviral therapy liver transplant wait list . This eventually correlate degree hepatic fibrosis present within different geographic site cirrhotic liver . Tissue sample obtain patient 's liver explant well hilar lymph node . Upon removal cirrhotic liver time transplantation , explant biopsied multiple time different segment liver preserve viral detection study well analysis degree fibrosis . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) obtain viral detection time transplantation . Serum HCV RNA level also obtain 1 month , 3 month 6 month post liver transplantation . Study Hypotheses : - Virological relapse non-response high patient cirrhosis due failure antiviral medication concentrate adequately fibrotic liver alter sinusoidal micro-architecture - HCV may persist different geographic region fibrotic liver part predicate blood supply area may effect overall virological response . These difference viral persistence detection may exist different lobe liver even within centimeter within portion liver parenchyma . - PBMC hilar lymph node may extrahepatic reservoir HCV viral persistence patient receive antiviral therapy may account virological relapse post-therapy - There may vary degree fibrosis within cirrhotic liver may impact hepatic synthetic function antiviral response treatment .</brief_summary>
