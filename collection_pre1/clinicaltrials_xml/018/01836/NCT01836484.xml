	<brief_summary>This prospective diagnostic performance study compare three new image method current standard imaging method diagnosis metastatic lymph node .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diagnostic Accuracy MRI , DWI MRI , FDG-PET/CT FEC PET/CT Detection Lymph Node Metastases Surgically Staged Endometrial Cervical Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim demonstrate whether lead edge molecular imaging technology ( FDG-PET/CT , DW-MRI Fluoro-ethyl-choline ( FEC ) PET/CT ) identify lymph node metastasis sufficient accuracy allow non-invasive lymph node stag patient endometrial cervical carcinoma .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Females 18 year old ; ( upper limit ) . 2 . Patients histologically confirm cancer cervix endometrium . 1 . In patient cervix cancer , must confirmation invasive disease ; FIGO stage 1B1 high FIGO stage demonstrate clinically and/or MRI . In patient advanced disease consider chemoradiotherapy treatment , patient may consider entry nodal lymphadenectomy use inform radiotherapy planning ; 2 . In patient endometrial cancer , ) stage 1A myometrial invasion high stage grade 3 b ) stage 1A myometrial invasion high stage serous papillary clear cell subtypes 3. stage II disease histology grade The MDT decision may base combination tumour characteristic histology , clinical imaging finding . 3 . No contraindication FDGPET/CT , FECPET/CT MRI . 4 . Fit surgical lymphadenectomy , determine local MDT . The patient also consider fit extend field radiotherapy case lymphadenectomy undertaken inform radiotherapy planning . The extent lymph node dissection make local multidisciplinary team , base presence risk factor lymph node metastasis , accord protocol . Patients must consider fit undergo lymph node dissection . 5 . Able willing give write informed consent comply study protocol procedures 1 . Known contraindication MRI PET/CT scan . 2 . Known allergy FDG FEC . 3 . Not consider fit lymphadenectomy ( open laparoscopic ) , appropriate , radiotherapy , determine local MDT . 4 . If patient pregnant breastfeeding . 5 . Females childbearing potential must willing use effective method contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ) time consent sign 6 week last PET/CT scan unless undergo hysterectomy . Note : subject consider childbearing potential surgically sterile ( undergone bilateral tubal ligation bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal 6 . Females childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within three week prior register study . 7 . Participation another Clinical Trial Investigational Medicinal Product ( CTIMP ) . If patient 's recently complete CTIMP trial must last dose ( ) study drug prior first image procedure MAPPING study . 8 . Participation another clinical trial ( CTIMP nonCTIMP ) protocol contain imaging procedure would occur MAPPING study . 9 . Medical psychiatric illness , make patient unsuitable unable give inform consent .</criteria>
