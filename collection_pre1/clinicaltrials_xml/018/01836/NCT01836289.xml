	<brief_summary>This research do see people Crohn 's disease receive high-dose cyclophosphamide improvement disease , long benefit may last , safe cyclophosphamide . This study patient medically refractory disease easily amenable surgery . Cyclophosphamide FDA-approved chemotherapy medication also frequently use treat autoimmune illness ; use cyclophosphamide autoimmune disease approve FDA . An autoimmune illness immune system mistakenly attack self , target cell , tissue , organs person 's body . There many different autoimmune disease affect body different way . Crohn 's disease autoimmune disease primarily affect small large intestine . High dose-cyclophosphamide successfully use treat Crohn 's , primarily part condition regimen autologous stem cell transplantation . However , therapy limit Crohn 's 's serious infectious risk . This current study involve use high-dose cyclophosphamide without need stem cell transplantation . This appear safe approach autoimmune illness study .</brief_summary>
