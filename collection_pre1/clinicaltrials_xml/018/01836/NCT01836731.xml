To evaluate impact program health , socio-economic condition community functioning , single district chosen community randomly assign receive intervention immediately 18 month later . The evaluation lead US-based Innovation Poverty Action ( IPA ) researcher base National University Rwanda , Georgetown University , London School Hygiene Tropical Medicine New York University .
