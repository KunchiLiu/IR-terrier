	<brief_summary>Systemic sclerosis orphan , multiorgan disease affect connective tissue skin several internal organ . Digital ulcer frequent major impact quality life patient systemic sclerosis . The etiology digital ulcer complex multifactorial principal mechanism underlie digital ulcer formation ischemic , mechanic inflammatory , alone combination , basis systemic sclerosis vasculopathy . Consequently , least three type DU : ( ) localize tips finger toe , mainly result ischemic process , ( ii ) localize dorsal aspect finger skin retraction due fibrosis bony prominence seem main cause , ( iii ) evolve pit scar subcutaneous calcinosis due combine irritative-inflammatory mechanism . An early therapy prevent rapidly heal digital ulcer today consider mandatory approach maintain quality life spare enormous cost due conventional digital ulcer management . This observational trial part collaborative project `` DeSScipher '' , one five observational trial decipher optimal management systemic sclerosis . Aim observational trial : 1 . To identify best treatment combination prevention digital ulcer patient fulfilment new ACR/EULAR SSc criterion preliminary VEDOSS criterion early diagnosis systemic sclerosis 2 . To identify best treatment associate improved healing digital ulcer patient fulfilment new ACR/EULAR SSc criterion Thus , observational trial consist prevention arm healing arm .</brief_summary>

Patients without previous history digital ulcer ( currently without active digital ulcer ) allocate prevention arm . Definition digital ulcer ( DU ) : DU 1 ) loss tissue , 2 ) DU derive digital pitting scar 3 ) DU derive calcinosis . IN THIS STUDY WE CONSIDER ONLY DU ( 1 ) LOSS OF TISSUE . THE OTHER DU ( 2 ) DU ( 3 ) ARE REGISTERED IN THE DATA BASE IF THEY ARE PRESENT , BUT ARE EXCLUDED FROM EVALUATION .</criteria>
