	<brief_summary>Optimal management patient advance NSCLC PS 2 remain controversial underrepresented clinical trial , typically account 5 10 % enrolled patient . Patient PS 2 proportion population-based study considerably high include clinical trial . Management patient PS 2 clinical practice empirical inconsistent . Patients median overall survival 3 5 month randomize trial , treatment option include best supportive care , single-agent combination chemotherapy . Retrospective study suggest patient PS 2 may benefit first-line chemotherapy term symptom improvement overall survival . In many study , single-agent chemotherapy compare best supportive care alone . Data role cisplatin-based combination patient PS 2 scant , one study question benefit , another interrupt accrual undue toxicity . With regard carboplatin , Cancer Leukemia Group B ( CALGB ) study 9730 compare paclitaxel plus carboplatin versus paclitaxel alone subgroup 107 patient PS 2 ; median overall survival significantly longer group treat combination chemotherapy ( 4.7 versus 2.4 month ) . Combination chemotherapy carboplatin paclitaxel also produce statistically significantly high incidence severe hematological non-hematological toxicity . On basis aforementioned result , recent European panel state carboplatin-based low-dose cisplatin-based doublet might represent alternative option single-agent chemoterapy patient PS 2 . Outside clinical trial , single-agent chemotherapy 3rd generation agent remain valid option patient PS2 . Results demonstrate pemetrexed agent establish single-agent activity NSCLC , suggest potential candidate combination platinum agent currently utilized patient advance NSCLC . Favorable toxicity profile pemetrexed suggest agent ideal candidate single agent test combination among patient PS 2 . Substantial doubt remain comparative benefit monotherapy versus combination . Starting dose schedule pemetrexed set study base current label 2nd line treatment metastatic NSCLC 1st line treatment malignant pleural mesothelioma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase III , open label , randomize study enroll 228 patient advance 1:1 ratio time registration . Patients Arm A receive pemetrexed , 500 mg/m2 , appropriate vitamin supplementation ; patient Arm B receive dose schedule pemetrexed Arm A , combination carboplatin , AUC 5 . For purpose study , treatment ( Arm A Arm B ) consist four cycle therapy ( repeat every 21 day ) . Primary endpoint study overall survival ; secondary endpoint include toxicity , response rate , progression-free survival . At time analysis , patient stratify accord age ( ≥ 70 versus &lt; 70 year ) , disease stage ( IIIB versus IV ) , site , weight loss ( ≥ 5 Kg versus &lt; 5 Kg ) . The dose carboplatin determine accord formula develop Calvert et al. , show equation [ 1 ] us estimate creatinine clearance accord method Cockcroft Gault estimation glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) ( equation [ 2 ] ) : 1 . Dose carboplatin ( mg ) = Target AUC x ( GFR + 25 ) 2 . GFR = ( 140 - Age ) x Weight/ ( 72 x serum creatinine ) ( multiply 0.85 woman ) Sample Size Expected Accrual In CALGB 9730 study advance NSCLC , first-line treatment paclitaxel plus carboplatin result median overall survival 4.7 month among patient performance status 2 . In ECOG 1594 study , median overall survival patient performance status 2 treat platinum-based doublet 4.1 month . Approximately 208 eligible patient need provide 80 % power detect difference two treatment arm two-sided type I error 0.05 , assume pemetrexed plus carboplatin result median survival least 4.3 month , pemetrexed alone 2.9 month . An additional 20 patient accrued account early dropout rate 10 % , total 228 patient . It anticipate accrual time approximately 22 month patient follow 1 year completion treatment ; therefore , 2 year 10 month need complete study .</detailed_description>
