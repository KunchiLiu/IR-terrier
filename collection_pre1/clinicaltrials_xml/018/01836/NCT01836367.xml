	<brief_summary>Actinic keratoses ( AK ) common cutaneous lesion associate chronic ultraviolet radiation exposure . While authority consider AK pre-malignant lesion , consider incipient squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) . Among current therapy treatment AK excisional surgery , cryosurgery , electrodesiccation curettage , topical chemotherapy light therapy . Cryosurgery consider gold standard therapy , however lesion-directed therapy , cryosurgery treat subclinical lesion surround skin . Ingenol mebutate active compound sap Euphorbia peplus L. ( E. peplus ) . Topical ingenol mebutate treatment approve treatment AKs . The goal AK therapy physician provide effective , tissue-sparing treatment good cosmetic result . Ingenol mebutate gel 0.015 % show high clearance rate also transient localized inflammatory skin response resolve quickly without sequela . However , one common fear ingenol mebutate 's mechanism action purely destructive AKs healthy skin , retreatment would produce equally , , caustic result skin severe erosion , scaling , erythema . It hope debunk misconception demonstrate reapplication second cycle ingenol mebutate would result low LSR score compare LSR first cycle application . We plan treat 20 subject . Each qualify subject least 4-8 non-hypertrophic AKs 25 cm2 treatment area face scalp . All subject treat two cycle ingenol mebutate 0.015 % . The first cycle start Day 1 , second cycle start Day 29 ( four week apart ) . Subjects utilize daily three day regimen cycle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We plan treat 20 subject . Each qualify subject least 4-8 non-hypertrophic AKs 25 cm2 treatment area face scalp . All subject treat two cycle ingenol mebutate 0.015 % . The first cycle start Day 1 , second cycle start Day 29 ( four week apart ) . Subjects utilize daily three day regimen cycle . For first cycle study application , subject follow day 1 , day 2 , day 4 treatment ; day 1 baseline photograph take , day 2 LSR assess visual analog scale ( VAS ) regard perceive irritation conduct , day 4 LSR , VAS photograph take . Post-treatment follow-up conduct day 8 day 15 , LSR assess photograph take . Approximately four week later , second cycle daily three day regimen ingenol mebutate 0.015 % applied treatment area face scalp . Subjects followed treatment day 29 , day 30 day 32 ; day 29 LSR photograph take , day 30 LSR assess VAS conduct , day 32 LSR , VAS photograph take . Post-treatment follow-up second cycle application occur day 36 , day 43 , day 56 . During post-treatment follow-up visit LSR photograph take . LSR score day 4 day 32 assess blind observer . Lastly , day 29 day 56 patient 's treatment satisfaction evaluate 10 point visual analog scale ( VAS ) . Consequently , total 11 visit 56 day period .</detailed_description>
