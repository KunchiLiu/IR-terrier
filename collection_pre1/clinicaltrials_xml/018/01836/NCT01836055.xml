	<brief_summary>- The investigator conduct magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) study compare two MRI contrast agent people clinically isolated syndrome relapse remit multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . MS disease affect white matter gray matter brain . MRI use gold standard visualize degenerative change brain spine . The neurologist usually order MRI confirm diagnosis MS use conventional imaging method . These image reveal two main piece information regard ( ) location lesion ( b ) status lesion . While location lesion directly correlate clinical symptom , information status lesion informs neurologist whether lesion new ( active ) old ( chronic ) . - This ability differentiate new old lesion require use contrast agent . Currently , use agent reveal lesion unclear reveal full extent disease . In new lesion , may leakiness blood vessel contrast agent leak investigator see . In healthy control , blood brain barrier usually intact leak happen . One open question : `` extravasation contrast agent brain precede major tissue damage see structural MRI ? '' - Recently , new FDA approve contrast agent ( Gadavist ) release enhanced characteristic term affect MR signal result good contrast image therefore , good diagnosis status disease . Given high relaxivity , small amount Gadavist may show good signal enhancement affect tissue multiple sclerosis patient . The investigator hypothesize Gadavist reveal tissue damage ( lesion ) Magnevist , therefore , may present good tool early diagnosis brain damage . - The investigator ' goal research project see new contrast agent able detect change differentiate healthy affected tissue white matter gray matter earlier current contrast agent detection possible major damage occur tissue . Each person scan initially one agent 8 30 day later agent . The MR data processing result compare check efficacy contrast agent .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale/Goal : The use contrast agent magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) gold standard diagnose multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . One active lesion ( i.e . enhance injection contrast agent ) one major McDonald criterion diagnosis patient MS request follow . Therefore , great importance study characteristic contrast agent ability cross blood brain barrier enhance lesion , thus understand mechanism underlie debilitate disease . It aim proposal compare lesion load visualization MS patient use Magnevist Gadavist contrast agent show reduced whole brain perfusion MS patient compare healthy subject . This proposal allow u investigate increase angiogenic sensitivity contrast agent ( Gadavist ) , addition test ability differentiate breakdown blood brain barrier . METHODS -Study Design : Fifty-four ( 54 ) subject enrol study include 36 MS patient 18 healthy subject age gender-matched control one year period . Approval Wayne State University Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) obtain begin study . All participant sign inform consent form tell study possible associate risk . We propose study 18 relapse remit MS ( RRMS ) patient 18 clinically isolated syndrome ( CIS ) patient 18 normal control . The subject scan entry second time ( scan 2 ) - sooner 8 day first scan later 30 day first scan . Every effort make scan close possible 8 day period . Nine RRMS nine CIS patient undergo MR scan use Magnevist first ( scan 1 entry ) Gadavist ( scan 2 ) nine category undergo MR scan use Gadavist first ( scan 1 entry ) Magnevist ( scan 2 ) . Eighteen normal subject undergo protocol describe MS patient , 9 one order ( Magnevist Gadavist ) 9 ( Gadavist Magnevist ) , use age gender match control data analysis . Patients recruit physician affiliate Detroit Medical Center ( DMC ) surround area . MR Protocol The investigator prepare MR image protocol allow information assess quantitatively MS normal population . This protocol include usual conventional T2 , fluid attenuate inversion recovery ( FLAIR ) , susceptibility weight imaging ( SWI ) , pre post T1 scan ( volumetric interpolate breath-hold ( VIBE ) magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo ( MP-RAGE ) ) early later time point well dynamic susceptibility contrast enhance perfusion weight imaging ( DSC-PWI ) , flow average perfusion use phase contrast ( PC ) , MR angiography ( MRA ) double inversion recovery ( DIR ) . For DSC-PWI , investigator develop perfusion software necessary analyze data quantitatively include new processing approach refer Tissue Similarity Mapping ( TSM ) . This technique use time point PWI data yield new mean study similarity blood flow pattern tissue brain . It may help good diagnose vascular difference tissue ( specifically MS lesion ) , addition conventional processing measure relative cerebral blood flow , relative cerebral blood volume , mean transit time , several measure white matter gray matter area brain . If Magnevist use initial scan , protocol repeat subject period 8 30 day use Gadavist . - Image acquisition The investigator design protocol ass pathophysiology MS lesion space time . SWI use mean visualize iron deposition lesion , possibly result myelin breakdown microhemorrhages . FLAIR , T2 DIR use assess inflammation edema lesion . Contrast enhance sequence include PWI , SWI T1 , order , use dynamically assess vascular characteristic different structure brain include white matter , gray matter lesion . PC use investigate blood supply drainage brain correlation identify perfusion deficit . This add 4 6 minute original protocol . MRA , hand , use visualize ass blood supply system integrity . Finally , investigator acquire T1 SWI sequence different time point post contrast ( please refer Sequence_Order.pdf ) compare mechanism work Magnevist Gadavist term relaxivity permeability ability show lesion . - Data analysis Perfusion Weighted Imaging PWI well establish MRI method study cerebral hemodynamics find various application tumor , angiogenesis stroke image . The hemodynamic characteristic determine create map various parameter , : cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) , cerebral blood volume ( CBV ) , mean transit time ( MTT ) time bolus peak ( TTP ) , parameter map derive evolution intensity T2*-weighted gradient- spin-echo , echo-planar image gadolinium contrast agent bolus pass blood vessel . Through use map , possible visualize passage blood throughout brain identify region abnormal behavior . Quantification hemodynamic parameter possible , utilizing central volume theorem subsequent deconvolution technique . investigator develop software SPIN ( signal processing Nuclear magnetic resonance ) , Detroit , Michigan , USA ) process PWI source data create perfusion map . The position arterial input function ( AIF ) , need deconvolution , automatically determine use maximum concentration ( Cmax ) , time peak ( TTP ) first moment MTT ( fMTT ) . The concentration-time curve artery short fMTT , short TTP high Cmax . Twenty voxels , best fit property , select . Then , concentration-time curve voxels average , smooth truncate avoid signal second pas tracer . Singular value decomposition ( SVD ) use determine hemodynamic parameter CBV , CBF MTT . The parametric map derive PWI data use investigator ' in-house software SPIN . These map include relative cerebral blood flow cerebral blood volume white matter , gray matter MS lesion . This reveal changes/ abnormality relate vascular system ischemia , infarcts abnormal blood flow specific region might involve MS pathogenesis . Finally , color-coded map CBV CBF application threshold compute generate pixel-by-pixel well visualize difference tissue . - Susceptibility Weighted Imaging A 64x64 ( equivalent ) low spatial frequency kernel matrix use complex-divide original k-space data create effective high pas filter phase image ( check reference 12 ) . The result SWI filter phase image use mean visualize lesion iron content . - Conventional MR sequence include T1 , T2 FLAIR Two blind radiologist review conventional MR data set determine presence chronic active MS lesion time compare result non-conventional MR quantitative result ( SWI PWI ) .
