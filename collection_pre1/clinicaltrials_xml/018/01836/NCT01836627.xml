	<brief_summary>This research study include child age 5 20 year old Collagen Type 6 Congenital Muscular Dystrophy Laminin α2-related muscular dystrophy ( LAMA2-MD ) . The goal study measure effect breathe exercise stretch chest slow loss breathing function . The breathing stretch do machine call Cough Assist® . The study do Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center Children 's Hospital Philadelphia . The study involve travel one 2 center 4 visit 13 month . The study also include 3 set phone visit call Daily Phone Diaries . Participants `` randomize '' one 2 study group 1:1 ratio . The treatment group use Cough Assist® machine twice day 15 minute . The control group continue current daily care . The Cough Assist® machine blow air lung ( insufflation ) help pull air lung . The investigator blow enough air lung cause stretch chest . This call hyperinsufflation . Study visit last 5 6 hour include medical quality life questionnaire pulmonary function test determine lung function individualize setting prescribe Cough Assist® .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Test Lung Stretch Therapy ( Hyperinsufflation ) Children With Collagen VI Muscular Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congenital muscular dystrophy ( CMD ) secondary collagen VI deficiency Laminin α2-related muscular dystrophy ( LAMA2-MD ) distinct genetic neuromuscular disorder present birth . Respiratory failure principal cause morbidity mortality disease . As CMD exist treatment , majority affect child develop respiratory failure require non-invasive ventilation first second decade life . There evidence muscular dystrophy progressive decrease lung volume disproportionally great anticipated degree respiratory muscle weakness . Chest wall stiffness decrease lung elasticity collectively diminish compliance respiratory system believe important contributor disproportionate decrease lung volume . The investigator ' research aim test hypothesis subject CMD Collagen VI LAMA2-MD , daily passive stretch chest wall lung hyperinsufflation therapy could slow annual rate decline lung volume , delay onset respiratory failure improve quality life . This randomize , control , interventional study . The intervention consist individualized hyperinsufflation titration protocol . The duration active protocol last 12 month . Because CMD present limit subject pool , study partnership Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Cincinnati ( CCHMC ) Children 's Hospital Philadelphia ( CHOP ) approximately half study do site . Potential subject identify Cure CMD international registry disease specific websites meet need number subject . At Visit 1 , subject baseline assessment , QOL ( quality Life ) questionnaires , pressure titration hyperinsufflation protocol determine Peak Insufflation Pressure ( PIP ) . Subjects give randomization assignment either Treatment Control arm . Both group pressure titration hyperinsufflation protocols Peak Insufflation Pressure ( PIP ) study visit . For Treatment Group , participants Visit 1 leave prescription setting Cough Assist® device begin 12 month interventional period 15 minute , twice daily hyperinsufflation treatment . Between visit , Treatment group mail back information card ( SD card ) Cough Assist measure adherence . All visit identical treatment control group include activity Visit 1 except randomization . There 3 schedule phone visit Daily Phone Diary ( DPD ) encounter . The DPD phone-based diary track patient / caregiver activity past 24 hour use cue recall procedure . A set two DPDs ( one weekday one weekend day ) conduct phone 3 assessment point . The investigator anticipate significant number subject live great 100 mile research center . Travel arrangement make family pay study additional funding provide Cure CMD .</detailed_description>
