	<brief_summary>The RESPECT study intend prospectively assess impact PET/CT delineation target volume estimate proportion recurrence could possibly prevent use PET/CT-based target volume , instead CT-based . Patients recieve radiotherapy use CT-based planning , PET/CT-based treatment plan also make . CT-based PET/CT-based target volume compare treatment complete . If locoregional recurrence take place , localisation compare CT-based PET/CT base clinical target volume ( CTVs ) . If local recurrence locate outside CT-CTV inside PET/CT-CTV , recurrence could possibly prevent PET/CT-based radiotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective cohort study test hypothesis proportion patient , locoregional recurrence , observe 6 , 12 18 month treatment , prevent PET/CT-based treatment planning use instead CT-based treatment plan alone . Patients eligible study undergo definitive radiotherapy without concomitant chemotherapy planning-CT base target volume , either follow surgery . A planning-PET/CT make research purpose , blind treat physician . This planning-PET/CT used actual treatment planning . In case neoadjuvant chemoradiation response therapy analyse pathologic evaluation esophageal specimen . Routine follow carry every 6 month , use CT . In case locoregional recurrence and/or metastasis , patient follow 18 month study evaluation . In case distant metastasis , patient censor locoregional recurrence exclude . When indicated , palliative treatment give . In case ( suspicion ) locoregional recurrence , PET/CT-based recurrence analysis carry comparison co-registration CT-based PET/CT-based target volume .</detailed_description>
