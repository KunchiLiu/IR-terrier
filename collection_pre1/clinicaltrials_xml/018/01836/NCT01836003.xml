	<brief_title>An Intervention Improve Antenatal Access CD4 Testing HAART Botswana</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Perinatal antiretroviral therapy dramatically reduce risk transmission HIV 1.4 million infant bear annually HIV-infected mother . Single-dose single-drug strategy lead important reduction mother-to-child transmission ( MTCT ) . However , intense strategy use maternal highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) suppress viral replication , lead 10-fold great reduction risk MTCT . Wider access maternal HAART could nearly eliminate estimated 430,000 annual HIV- infection acquire infant worldwide . Additionally , prompt initiation HAART pregnant woman low CD4+ cell count could improve maternal mortality prevent development resistant maternal infant HIV infection . However , study southern Africa , include Botswana , indicate less one-third treatment-eligible woman able access antenatal HAART . Programmatic inefficiency setting lead substantial delay CD4 test subsequent treatment initiation . Novel implementation strategy urgently need improve access establish benefit antenatal HAART . In collaboration colleague Botswana Ministry Health , complete analysis root cause failure antenatal HAART , identify delay CD4 test result reporting , loss-to-follow-up principal barrier . To assess hypothesis low-cost intervention improve antenatal access CD4 test HAART initiation , Tokafatso project staged-wedge , cluster-randomized study combination programmatic intervention . The intervention includesâ€” improve access CD4 phlebotomy , rapid CD4 result return via SMS messaging , active follow-up treatment eligible woman . All enrol clinic receive intervention , order implementation randomize ( 10 stage 2 clinic ) . Endpoints assess clinic receive receive intervention adjust temporal factor . While clinic enrol receive intervention , endpoint assess anonymous maternity record abstraction woman subsequently deliver catchment inpatient maternity ward . While tailored situation Botswana , finding expect generalizable implementation comprehensive prevention MTCT service throughout region .</detailed_description>
