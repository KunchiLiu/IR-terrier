	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : The investigator propose obese parturients increase inflammatory response decrease anti-inflammatory response surgical anesthetic insult caesarean section associate high rate perioperative complication , compare non-obese parturients.2 Background : Obese patient exhibit high level inflammatory marker non-obese patient . Furthermore , obese patient higher incidence perioperative complication , especially wound infection , well document caesarean section population . The pregnant population unique result immunologic change occur baseline , increase pro-inflammatory marker see serum placental tissue obese subject , demonstrate correlate adverse fetal outcome . Specific Objectives : To determine baseline level three establish marker inflammation term pregnant obese non-obese patient ( define BMI &gt; &lt; 35 kg/M2 respectively ) , examine change response stress surgery/anesthesia . The investigator correlate inflammatory response incidence postoperative wound infection . Methods : Patients recruit study prior plan caesarean section . Blood sample inflammatory marker level perform preoperatively , immediately postoperatively , 24 hour postoperatively . Samples analyze pentraxin-3 ( relatively novel inflammatory marker ) , C reactive protein ( CRP ) ( well-known clinically relevant inflammatory marker ) , interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) ( establish anti-inflammatory marker ) . Plasma analyze ELISA determine level biomarker . Patient chart review determine patient experience surgical complication 30 day postoperatively . Surgical complication correlate measured level inflammatory marker . Assuming level inflammatory cytokine obese patient 15 % high obese parturients assume alpha error level 5 % beta error level 20 % , investigator would need study 18 patient per group prove hypothesis inflammatory cytokine level correlate postoperative infection . The investigator plan study 20 patient per group account potential patient attrition rate 10 % study . Significance/Importance : The connection obesity dysregulation perioperative inflammatory response well establish perioperative inflammation obese population link observe increased perioperative morbidity . The investigator hope demonstrate connection hopefully able identify risk patient earlier , subsequent study intervene reduce risk postoperative wound infection pharmacokinetically target antimicrobial prophylaxis .</brief_summary>
