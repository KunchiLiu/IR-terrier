Secondary - To evaluate WOMAC score patient Plaivana® compare placebo group . - To compare amount acetaminophen tablet take group . - To compare side effect Plaivana® placebo . Investigational plane Study Design This phase III randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled cross-over trial 12 week duration . This study design evaluate efficacy Plaivana® placebo , adult OA knee . Randomization stratify Kellgren-Lawrence ( KL ) grading ( grade 2 3 ) use X-ray stand MTP technique . A total 100 subject ( 100 pair subject ) plan enrollment study . This study conduct approximately 12 week . Patients Methods Patients study design This phase III randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled cross-over trial 12 week duration design evaluate efficacy Plaivana® placebo , adult OA knee . A total 100 subject ( 100 pair subject ) plan enrollment study . This 8 week period study treatment-control period ( 4 week treatment , two week wash-out 4 week placebo period ) . The study conduct accordance Declaration Helsinki , approve Khon Kaen University Ethics Committee Human Research inform consent obtain patient . Study medication The essential plai cream anti-inflammatory antimicrobial effect ( Wasuwat1989 , Giwanon 2000 , Pithayanukul 2007 , Tripathi 2008 ) . Active chemical plai cream compose sabinene , alpha gamma tepinenes , terpinen 4-ol ( E ) -1- ( 3,4-dimethoxyphenyl butadiene ( DMPBD ) . The DMPBD property anti-inflammatory activity ( Ozaki 1991 , Jeenapongsa 2003 ) . Plavina® 40 mg 100 gm ( contain DMPBD … % ) . This product supply lacquered aluminum collapsible tube contain 100 gram cream packing . Treatment Assignment dose Subjects assign study treatment accordance randomization schedule . Randomization stratify KL grade ( grade 2 3 ) . At Baseline/Randomization Visit , subject randomly assign either Plaivana® placebo cream . Plaivana® placebo cream apply three time around index knee . The 2 inch length cream topically applied skin around index knee joint , rub cream dry . After apply cream , patient wash hand touch eye . Blinding This double-blind study . All study drug blind investigator subject . The study placebo cream prepare lacquered aluminum collapsible tube contain 100 gram cream packing . Product Accountability In accordance standard requirement , investigator must document amount investigational cream product dispense /or administer study return investigator . Product accountability record must maintain throughout course study . Treatment Compliance A drug-dispensing log maintain investigator . Subjects instructed baseline visit record date apply cream lacquer aluminum collapsible tube bring tube study visit day . Subject compliance assess base weight return tube , collect record Data Record Form . Subject ask complete diary card capture daily apply dos cream . Concomitant Medications Non-drug therapy Subject ask complete diary card capture daily apply dos cream . Subject ask complete diary capture take change concomitant therapy study , include pain medication nutritional supplement OA relate pain . Subjects permit take acetaminophen ( 500 mg ) three time two tablet pain every 4-6 hour . Other topical analgesic , NSAID COX-2 inhibitor prohibit . All concomitant medication nutritional supplement take study also record . During wash-out period Subjects permit take acetaminophen OA pain 7 day . Subjects maintain write diary record dose medication nutritional supplement OA-associated pain . STUDY ASSESSMENT AND PROCEDURES Subjects expect attend clinic minimum 6 time period approximately 12 week . The study consist 7 phase : screen , treatment , follow-up , washout , screen , treatment , follow-up . The study investigation discus subject detail study objective , requirement restriction . The screen 1st visit include formal review complete medical history , concurrent medication , concomitant disease , medication take within last month medication interested exclusion criterion , eligibility requirement study include contraindication plai cream . Eligible subject determine exclusion criterion severe pain define 80 mm 100 mm VAS scale pain , identify subject response WOMAC pain subscale . If OA present knee investigator identify knee X-ray study entry , preference knee severe pain ( &lt; 80 mm WOMAC pain sub scale ) A radiograph index knee obtain use MTP technique evaluate JSW KL grade . The minimum JSW must least 1.5 mm medial compartment least 2.5 mm correspond lateral compartment KL grade 2 3 . At screen 1st visit , subject instruct withhold OA medication pain 7 day NSAIDs 24 hour acetaminophen immediately prior baseline visit . At 2nd visit subject randomize follow stratification KL grade . This visit , follow procedure complete : - VAS - WOMAC Subject receive first study placebo cream , acetaminophen 500 mg 40 tablet daily record symptom . Efficacy Assessments Primary endpoint VAS : The primary endpoint change baseline VAS . This endpoint measure visit 2-13 ( week 1-12 ) Secondary endpoint WOMAC Score The WOMAC score tri-dimensional , disease-specific , self-administered health status measure , probe clinically important , subject-relevant symptom area pain . The subject answer WOMAC question pain subscale , use Linkert scale 0-100 screen 1st visit determine eligibility inclusion study . The subject complete entire WOMAC questionnaire visit 2-13 ( week 1-12 ) Safety Assessments Adverse event The investigator responsible detecting , document report event meet definition adverse event . Definition adverse event unfavorable unintended sign ( include clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding , example ; skin rash , swell ) , symptom , disease temporally associate use medicinal product , whether consider adverse event.Any adverse event document patient chart report Adverse Event Form . Dropouts Reason dropout The patient may drop-out study decide , time irrespective reason , may investigator decision . All dropout must document investigator must give reason . Data Analysis statistical consideration Sample size determination The primary endpoint change baseline visual analog scale ( VAS ) .The secondary endpoint Western Ontario McMaster score ( WOMAC ) . These endpoint measure every week 9 week ( 4 week treatment period one week washout period ) . This study determine demonstrate Plaivana® able reduce pain ( VAS ) , functional score stiffness score compare placebo cream . It expect Plaivana® reduce VAS 1.23 ( considers Minimal Clinical Improvement Important , MCII ) SD 4.39 . The significant level 95 % alpha 5 % two-sided test power detect different 80 % beta 20 % . Therefore , sample size 103 pair patient need . Adding 5 % dropout rate , would need approximately 108 pair patient ( 108 patient ) randomize treatment group study . N pair = ½ ( 1+1/λ ) [ ( Z1-α/2+Z1-β ) 2/D2pair + ( Z2 1-α/2 ) /2 ] Λ= number control : case = 1 D= Effect size =VAS difference/SDof VAS The VAS difference minimal clinical improvement important 1.23 SDof VAS = 4.39 , therefore sample size 103 pair Hypothesis test The null hypothesis test VAS Plaivana® group different placebo group . Analysis population The primary analysis base patient intent-to-treat ( ITT ) population , include patient baseline result VAS , WOMAC score . Statistic method The mean different VAS Plaivana® placebo analyze Z test , 95 % CI mean different VAS . The confident interval mean VAS treatment group calculate . Other baseline factor WOMAC , Stiffness score acetaminophen use analysis ANOVA , student T test Mc Nemar 's Chi-square .
