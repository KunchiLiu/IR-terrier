	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare progression-free survival patient recurrent metastatic squamous cell carcinoma head neck ( SCCHN ) treat VTX-2337 + cisplatin carboplatin + 5-FU + cetuximab versus patient treat cisplatin carboplatin + 5-FU + cetuximab alone ( standard-of-care ; SOC ) . Safety overall survival also evaluate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Plus Cetuximab Combination With VTX-2337 Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel group study evaluate safety efficacy VTX 2337 combination cisplatin carboplatin , 5-FU cetuximab prolong progression-free survival subject recurrent metastatic squamous cell carcinoma head neck . OBJECTIVES : Primary Objective : To compare efficacy VTX 2337 plus SOC SOC alone prolong PFS patient recurrent metastatic SCCHN . Secondary Objectives : To compare follow two treatment group : - Safety VTX 2337 adverse event , include clinically significant change physical examination , peripheral blood hematology , serum chemistry , urinalysis , ECG . - Efficacy VTX 2337 plus SOC prolong OS patient recurrent metastatic SCCHN . - Efficacy VTX-2337 plus SOC ORR , DOBR , DCR , DDC irRECIST evaluation independent radiology review . Exploratory Objectives : - To compare genetic polymorphism may impact response patient TLR8 agonist cetuximab two treatment group . - To compare immune biomarker response VTX 2337 plus SOC measure multiplexed panel cytokine , chemokines , inflammatory marker two treatment group . - To compare effect immune cell subset within tumor response VTX-2337 and/or clinical outcome , measure immunohistochemistry primary tumor tissue two treatment group . - To assess PK VTX-2337 . OUTLINE : Subjects screen eligibility ( within 14 day ) qualify subject randomize 1:1 1 2 treatment group : SOC + VTX 2337 SOC + placebo . Tumor assessment CT MRI start Week 12 ( ± 3 day ) , Week 18 ( ± 3 day ) every 8 week ( ± 7 day ) thereafter . Response evaluate immune-related RECIST criterion ( irRECIST ) confirm independent radiologist . Upon independent confirmation disease progression , active participation study complete subject undergo End Treatment evaluation . Subjects follow survival ~12 month last subject randomize .</detailed_description>
