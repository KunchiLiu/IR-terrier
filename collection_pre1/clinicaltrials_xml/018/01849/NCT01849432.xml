	<brief_summary>A diverse body research implicate amygdalo-cortical circuitry pathophysiology anxiety disorder . For example , one model PTSD posit exaggerate amygdala responsivity threat-related stimulus well deficient top-down modulation amygdala response specific cortical region , include pregenual anterior cingulate cortex , subcallosal cortex , hippocampus . The investigator propose investigate pathophysiology several specific anxiety disorder , Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) , Panic Disorder ( PD ) , Specific Phobia ( SP ) , use cognitive activation paradigm magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) probe function structure implicate amygdalo-cortical circuitry .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All candidate project undergo comprehensive clinical assessment investigator train administer instrument . At MGH fMRI Center Charlestown Neuroimaging Center McLean Hospital Belmont , MA ; subject undergo single MRI session last approximately 2 hour . After scan session , subject may ask make judgment facial expression word present .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>18 65 year age Righthanded ( Edinburgh Inventory Oldfield 1971 ) SCID diagnosis consistent group designation : Current PTSD ( PTSD group ; none current past ( NC TENC group ) ; Current SP ( must small animal phobia , SP group ) ; Current PD ( PD group ) To match age , gender , year education , well selfidentified race/ethnicity . For female subject , stage menstrual cycle ascertain history ( see appendix ) , date fMRI acquisition schedule prevent systematic difference group respect variable . Neurologic medical condition would interfere study procedure confound result , ascertained history . History seizure significant head trauma ( i.e. , extend loss consciousness , neurological sequela , know structural brain lesion ) History exclusionary Axis I psychiatric diagnosis ( specify ) ; i.e. , history substance use disorder , psychotic disorder , bipolar disorder , tic disorder , eat disorder . Note comorbid current major depressive disorder allow one half study group . This enable inclusion common comorbidity , also enable definitive assessment whether presence comorbid diagnosis drive observed significant group difference . Use psychotropic medication within 4 week prior study ( within 6 week fluoxetine , longlived compound ; within one year neuroleptic ) . Pregnancy ( rule urine ÃŸHCG ) . Metallic implant device contraindicate magnetic resonance imaging .</criteria>
