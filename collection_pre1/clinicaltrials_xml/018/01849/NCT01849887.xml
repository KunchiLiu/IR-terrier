	<brief_summary>Stroke major cause adult disability . Currently approve reperfusion therapy provide small percentage patient U.S. New therapy need improve outcome access majority patient . Animal study suggest bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell , administer intravenously day stroke , safely improve long-term behavioral outcome . A large human experience suggest safety allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell . The current study aim ass safety therapy patient recent ischemic stroke .</brief_summary>
