	<brief_title>Autologous Stem Cell Transplant Followed By Maintenance Therapy Treating Elderly Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) start dexamethasone , cisplatin , Adriamycin ( doxorubicin ) , Cytoxan ( cyclophosphamide ) , etoposide ( DPACE ) participant least one day protocol treatment . II . To evaluate well therapy tolerate patient mainly age 65 year assess severe complication ( intensive care unit [ ICU ] admission , death ) percentage participant able complete full course therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate Quality-Of-Life post-transplant use European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) Quality Life Core Questionnaire QLQ-C30 QLC-MY20 . OUTLINE : INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients receive dexamethasone orally ( PO ) day 1-4 8-11 , cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) continuously , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV continuously , cyclophosphamide IV , etoposide IV day 1-4 . Patients receive pegfilgrastim subcutaneously ( SQ ) day 6 13 undergo collection stem cell white blood cell ( WBC ) cluster differentiation ( CD ) 34 count within program range . Following stem cell collection , patient may receive interim dexamethasone PO day 1-4 , every 14 day discretion treat physician . TRANSPLANT : Beginning 4 week 6 month first day induction therapy , patient receive transplant condition regimen dexamethasone PO day -4 -1 day +2 +5 , bortezomib IV bolus day -4 , -1 , 2 , 5 , thalidomide PO day -4 5 , melphalan IV day -4 -1 . Patients undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant ( PBSCT ) day 0 . Between transplant consolidation therapy , patient receive dexamethasone PO day 1-4 every 21 day thalidomide PO daily . CONSOLIDATION THERAPY : If administer , post-transplant consolidation may begin 4-6 week transplant occur 4 month later . Most patient receive consolidation . Those receive dexamethasone PO day 1-4 8-11 , thalidomide PO day 1-11 , bortezomib IV day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 , cisplatin IV continuously , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV continuously , cyclophosphamide IV continuously , etoposide IV continuously day 1-4 . MAINTENANCE THERAPY YEAR 1 : Beginning 6 weeks-6 month consolidation therapy 4 week 6 month transplant consolidation skip , patient receive bortezomib IV bolus day 1 , 4 , 15 , 18 , thalidomide PO QD day 1-28 , dexamethasone PO day 1-4 15-18 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE THERAPY YEAR 2 : Patients receive bortezomib IV day 1 , 4 , 15 , 18 , cyclophosphamide PO IV day 1 15 , dexamethasone PO QD day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow least annually study center , serum MM marker result send study site close monitoring PFS .</detailed_description>
