Wagner Grade 1 2 . Has sign infection osteomyelitis Plantar neuropathic ulcer predominately plantar surface ( i.e . weight bearing ) foot ensure adequate offloading may include toe Size target ulcer must 0.756 cm2 . Target ulcer must nonhealing define &lt; 30 % reduction area response standard care Screening Period If one ulcer present meet inclusion criterion , large one consider target ulcer If two ulcer size meet criterion , one high Wagner Grade consider target ulcer If two ulcer size Wagner Grade , one present long qualifying time target ulcer . Nontarget ulcer also treat accord standard care ( Acute Charcot Neuroarthropathy foot target ulcer must exclude ) Has ankle brachial index ( ABI ) ≥0.7 foot target ulcer .
