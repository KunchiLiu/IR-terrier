	<brief_summary>This research study Phase IV clinical trial . Phase IV trial use test monitor safety drug approve FDA see drug indication use treat different disease . Sorafenib new drug , approve brand name Nexavar treatment liver cancer . It also currently test various cancer . Sorafenib work slow and/or stop development new cancer cell new blood vessel . By slow and/or stop growth new blood vessel around tumor , believe sorafenib prevents slow growth tumor . The researcher study would like study effect sorafenib hepatitis C draw additional research blood sample people infect hepatitis C receive sorafenib treatment liver cancer . These test measure certain protein blood ( HCV-RNA ) may indicate sorafenib effect hepatitis C virus .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>HCV-RNA Kinetics During Sorafenib Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , open-label , non-interventional trial evaluate HCV-RNA level treatment Sorafenib patient advance hepatocellular carcinoma . Participants receive Sorafenib 400mg orally twice daily . HCV-RNA ( Hepatitis C Virus - Ribonucleic Acid ) level measure baseline , week 2 sorafenib , week 4 sorafenib , week 6 sorafenib , week 8 sorafenib , week 12 sorafenib , 2 week discontinue sorafenib . HCV-RNA level measure draw 2 tablespoon blood During study period , tumor assessment do MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) CT ( compute tomography ) scan baseline every 8 week .</detailed_description>
