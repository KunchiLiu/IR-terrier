	<detailed_description>Obesity increase risk several health condition . Weight loss 5-10 % initial weight reduces risk several disease . This degree weight loss achievable behavioral obesity program . However , 33 % initial weight loss regain within one year little weight loss maintain within three five year . Thus , new strategy improve long-term weight loss maintenance need . One dietary strategy increase self-reported satiation satiety consume low energy density ( ED ) diet . A low-ED diet allow great weight food relative total energy consume , propose mechanism enhance self-reported satiation satiety find low-ED meal . Research show participant serve low-ED meal , total weight food consume change , meal energy intake decrease . Importantly , low-ED meal consume across several day , reduce energy intake continue occur , show degree energy intake compensation . To address gap regard relationship dietary ED weight loss maintenance , propose conduct randomize control trial ( RCT ) examine effect low-ED prescription propose mechanism weight loss maintenance . The primary hypothesis : 1 . Low-ED less weight regain Energy Balance 22 month . . Weight regain 10 , 16 , 22 month examine determine difference occur condition . 2 . Low-ED consume lower ED diet , less energy percent energy fat , great gram solid food fiber Energy Balance 10 , 16 , 22 month . The secondary hypothesis : 3 . Identify mechanism ( mediator ) reduce ED improve long-term low energy intake , thus : 1 . Low-ED self-report low hunger great satiation satiety EMA Energy Balance 10 , 16 , 22 month .</detailed_description>
