	<brief_title>Docosahexaenoic Acid Preventing Recurrence Breast Cancer Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether treatment docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) 12 week 1000 mg twice daily compare placebo reduces normal breast tissue level tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) overweight obese patient history stage I-III invasive breast cancer , ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) , Paget 's disease , lobular carcinoma situ ( LCIS ) , proliferative benign breast disease . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate effect DHA 1000 mg twice daily tissue biomarkers - Change baseline cyclooxygenase-2 ( COX-2 ) /interleukin-1-beta ( IL-1beta ) /aromatase measure quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . - Change baseline crown-like structure breast ( CLS-B ) measure immunohistochemical technique cluster differentiation ( CD ) 68 . - Change baseline CLS-B index determine follow : ( [ number slide evidence least one CLS-B ] / [ total number slide examine ] ) . - Change baseline CLS-B/cm^2 define number CLS-B/cm^2 . II . Evaluate age predictor CLS-B inflammatory biomarkers ( TNF-alpha/COX-2/IL-1beta ) baseline time treatment . III . Evaluate red blood cell ( RBC ) fatty acid level surrogate compliance . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive docosahexaenoic acid orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) 12 week . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO BID 12 week .</detailed_description>
