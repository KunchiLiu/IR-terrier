	<brief_summary>The TRIO-physio study look well patient osteoarthritis recover knee replacement surgery ( also know Total Knee Arthroplasty ( TKA ) ) . Currently around 20 % patient satisfied TKA . This project look find research team identify patient recover well earlier stage , patient help sooner . The study try determine intense physiotherapy patient well first review ( 6 week operation ) improve well recover one year .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Targeted Rehabilitation Improve Outcome After Knee Replacement- A Physiotherapy Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study randomise control trial compare effect intensive physiotherapy compare current standard care therapy , target patient perform poorly 6 week follow total knee replacement . All patient make aware study pre-operatively recruit centre . Prior surgery complete routine pre-operative outcome assessment questionnaire ( Oxford Knee Score EQ-5D ) part national PROMS program undergo local standard total knee replacement immediate post-operative care pathway . All patient routinely review 6 week post-operatively usual clinical team . At review Oxford Knee Score assess . Those patient report score 26 less ( 0-48 OKS score system ) , define poor Kalairajah classification ( Kalairajah , 2005 ) , approach consent . If consent give patient eligible enter trial , randomisation one follow group occur : standard care ( encompass one physiotherapy review , 6 week home exercise prescription final review ) interventional arm , 18 session structure physiotherapy administer 6 week period , 6 session 'contact session ' perform supervision physiotherapist . All trial participant review immediately post intervention ( i.e . 14 week post operation ) postal questionnaire 26 52 week post-operation .</detailed_description>
