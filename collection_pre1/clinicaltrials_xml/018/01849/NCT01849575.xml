	<detailed_description>Visualization asymptomatic atherosclerotic disease improve cardiovascular prevention . Design randomize control intervention within ordinary health care - VIPVIZA . Design method : randomize control trial integrate exist set-up population base CVD screen prevention within primary health care , Västerbotten Intervention Programme ( VIP ) . VIP provide CVD risk factor screen individual health promotion county citizen age 40 , 50 60 year high participation rate ( around 70 % ) , small social selection bias standardize procedure . Study population : VIP-participants invite study accord inclusion criterion . This design guarantee population base study , focus individual intermediate CVD-risk , clinical relevance external validity . Sample size power : Power calculation base VIP data CVD risk factor 2011 , CIMT data Tromsö study , Norway . Enrolment 3200 participant estimate sufficient test outcome probability 0.8 detect true difference group significance level 0.05 . To compensate drop-outs study period , 3600 individual recruit . Population sample Inclusion criterion : ) age 60 year , ii ) history CVD age 60 year among first-degree relative iii ) age 50 year least one following : smoking , diabetes , hypertension , S-LDL-cholesterol ≥ 4.5 mmol/L , abdominal obesity . Exclusion criterion : significant stenosis define &gt; 50 % luminal narrowing investigate carotid artery accord vascular ultrasound Doppler measurement . Participants randomly equal probability assign two group . Intervention Image-based risk communication , i.e . visual information carotid ultrasound result , participant his/her primary care physician form atherosclerosis highlight graphically color normal vascular age pattern plaque formation . After 2─4 week follow─up call research nurse , give additional information reassurance , need . Control No information carotid ultrasound participant physician . Both group follow manage accord clinical guideline within primary health care entire study period . Outcome definition difference intervention control group : Primary outcome : CVD risk evaluate statistical risk model base conventional risk factor one year . Variable : Framingham risk score one-year follow-up ( Specific aim 1 ) . This surrogate variable change atherosclerosis assess carotid intima medium thickness presence plaque . The atherosclerotic process slow precision ultrasound measurement low allow evaluation intervention control group one year . Secondary outcome : The secondary outcome divide three category , correspond specific aim indicate . 1 . CVD risk factor , measure standard clinical method ( variable : blood pressure , Lipids , glucose value , BMI ) lifestyle , ( Physical activity , tobacco use , alcohol ( AUDIT ) , diet ) measure questionnaire baseline , 1-year 3-year visit . ( Specific aim 1 ) . 2 . Atherosclerotic disease , i.e . Ultrasound result baseline year 3 : carotid intima medium thickness ( CIMT ) , presence plaque presence degree stenosis . A portable automatic carotid ultrasound equipment ( CardioHealth Station® , Panasonic Healthcare Co. , Ltd , Tokyo , Japan ) use . A standardized protocol accord current guideline apply angle insonation automatically provide system record . Measurement CIMT ( max , min mean value ) automatic ( Specific aim 1 ) . 3 . Pharmacological treatment follow Pharmacological register medical record ( Specific aim 2 , 4 ) 4 . Novel biomarkers : Plasma sample collect baseline 3-year follow-up longitudinally analyze novel hypothesize CVD biomarkers . For Lipidomics collaboration establish Umeå Plant Science Centre , Protein biomarkers SciLifeLab Uppsala ( Specific aim 3 ) . 5 . Clinical endpoint follow register hospitalization cause death ( all-cause CVD specific ) : Myocardial infarction ( MI ) , stroke , revascularization procedure ( Specific aim 5 ) . Psychological behavioral factor , determinant mediator preventive action : 1 . Validated psychometric questionnaire baseline 3.year follow-up : e.g . Health related quality life ( Rand 36 ) , Self efficacy ( The General Self-efficacy test ) , cop strategy ( Brief COPE ) , Optimism ( Life Orientation Test-Revised ) , social network support ( ISSI ) , work stress ( Karasek demand/control model ) ( Specific aim 2 ) 2 . Social support network , education , civil status , stress work , quality life : VIP-data . 3 . Barriers facilitator primary CVD prevention explore deep interview physicians participant evaluate qualitative method ( Specific aim 4 ) Data analysis , statistical analytical test : Parametric non-parametric test use appropriate . Imaging result related risk factor establish multiple linear regression model . Predictive Cox Proportional Hazard model develop estimate overall predictive ability CIMT , plaque risk factor CVD morbidity mortality 5 10 year take account time risk disease death . Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves ( ROC ) estimate Area Under Curve ( AUC ) assure high possible sensitivity specificity prediction . Confirmatory ( structural equation model ) exploratory ( partial least square analysis ) statistical model employed establish relationship intervention intermediate mediating factor variable ' relative contribution explain change outcome variable .
