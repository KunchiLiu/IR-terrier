	<brief_summary>This research study do develop brain control medical device , call brain-machine interface BMI , provide people spinal cord injury ability control external device computer cursor robotic limb use thought . Developing brain-machine interface ( BMI ) difficult currently limit technology exist area neuroscience . The device study involve implant fine record electrode area brain know create arm movement plan provide hand grasp information . These movement grasp plan would normally send region brain execute actual movement . By tie pathway send movement plan signal computer instead , investigator translate movement plan actual movement computer cursor robotic limb . The device use study call NeuroPort Array surgically implant brain . This device implantation procedure experimental mean approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . One NeuroPort Array consist small grid electrode implant brain tissue small cable run electrode grid small hourglass-shaped pedestal . This pedestal design attached skull protrude though scalp allow connection computer equipment . The investigator hope learn safe effective NeuroPort Array control computer generate image real world object , robotic arm , use imagined movement arm hand . To accomplish goal , two NeuroPort Arrays use .</brief_summary>
