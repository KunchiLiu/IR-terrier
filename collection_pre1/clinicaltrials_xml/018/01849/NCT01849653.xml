	<brief_summary>To evaluate agreement NAAT result Chlamydia trachomatis Neisseria gonorrhoeae infection obtain self-obtained vaginal swab ( SOVS ) , collect non-clinical setting vs. NAAT result use SOVS collect clinical setting . This new use specimen type SOVS FDA clear use clinic . The NAAT ( Gen-Probe APTIMA Combo 2® Assay ( AC2 ) ) result home-collected SOVS specimen compare result obtain SOVS collect clinic multiple platform ( Direct Tube Sampling ( DTS ) / Panther / Tigris ) . The term `` home-collected '' use refer specimen collect clinic , since certainty specimen collect `` home '' restroom office setting , etc . To compare SOVS result FDA clear predicate test collection two clinician collect vaginal swab .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All potential participant enrol study undergo follow procedure : - Informed consent ( write ) participate study along review Participant Information Sheet Experimental Subject 's Bill Rights ( per site requirement ) - Assessment eligibility nurse/clinician - Collection two SOVS clinic - Collection two clinician collect vaginal swab clinic - Assessment clinical sign symptom - Group 1 - participant collect two SOVS clinic visit deliver specimen study staff clinic visit . - Group 2 - participant repeat collection two SOVS home clinic visit mail specimen directly laboratory . Clinical examination conduct appropriate reason visit/exam clinic procedure include part protocol . The enrollment strategy design recruit total 3500 woman average 42-60 woman per month 12-month recruitment period ( 500-700 woman per site recruitment period ) . Participants see recruit clinic participate STI-CTG , site clinic . At participate clinical center , recruitment personnel follow site specific process design help identify potential participant . Only one visit require complete study procedure . The total time require participant complete study may vary expect 45 minute total time 1 2 day . Intervals several day collection two specimen likely woman . Clinic staff approach woman clinic via phone explain object study requirement participation . The consent process adopt site dependent IRB approval . Written consent obtain participant . Participants give Participant Information Sheet read keep . [ In addition , sit clinic California must utilize `` Experimental Subject 's Bill Rights '' explain right research subject per California law . ] For Group 1 , discussion phone Information Sheet Experimental Subject 's Bill Rights include collection kit mail participant . Clinic staff utilize standard script include form Q &amp; A ensure participant basic understand SOVS procedure . Participants encourage call clinic staff question receive home collection kit . After participant provide informed consent , nurse/clinician assign unique participant number ( PN ) note consent procedure appropriate eligibility information Case Report Form ( CRF ) . The nurse/clinician discus basic demographic , medical history concomitant medication information participant record information either study specific note page , CRF . These maintain participant 's research study record . This information use assess eligibility . Participants study group provide swab collection kit along diagram showing collect SOVS specimen . The participant collect swab designate place clinic ( often rest room ) begin visit specimen collect . Next , nurse/clinician conduct examination manage participant 's healthcare . If standard care clinic SOVS process use AC2 , participant undergo additional specimen collection per local clinic 's standard care diagnosis management Ct/GC . Standard protocols clinical management may differ study site modify result study . Beyond laboratory 's AC2 Ct/GC NAAT clinical result , site standard protocols relevant study . Participants notify regard test result SOVS collect solely study . This end Study participation Group 1 . At end clinic visit Group 2 participant , nurse/clinician provide HOLOGIC|Gen-Probe , Inc. provide home swab collection kit ( mailed participant Group 1 ) . The kit identical kit use clinic addition mail container relevant mailing label . Participants instructed return home ( another non-clinical private location ) collect two additional specimen : - within 24 hour clinic visit - prior resume sexual activity - prior take antibiotic prescribe Group 2 participant mail specimen laboratory mailer provide within 24 hour collect sample . Participants give instruction collect swab regardless whether clinic restroom home . Group 2 participant receive follow-up communication 48 hour clinic appointment . Participants group complete study procedure clinic initial visit . One questionnaire administer participant ( Home-collected SOVS CRF ) follow clinical data collect part study - participant 's age , gender , race/ethnicity , clinical sign &amp; symptom , date exam , date/time specimen collected/mailed/received , UADEs ( ) , AC2 result . All laboratory evaluation use APTIMA Combo 2® assay detection Ct/GC infection SOVS specimens collect `` home '' `` clinic '' across 3 different platform ( DTS , Panther , Tigris ) . One set specimen collection tube ( `` home '' `` clinic '' ) test DTS 5 7 laboratory associate clinical site . A matched set specimen collection tube ship 1 3 designated laboratory site test Panther . Once Panther test complete , set tube ship 1 3 different laboratory site test Tigris . Results compare assess agreement pair specimen test within platform ( DTS / Panther / Tigris ) . The APTIMA Combo 2® Assay ( HOLOGIC | Gen-Probe Inc. , San Diego , CA ) nucleic acid amplification test ( NAAT ) utilize target capture detection differentiation ribosomal RNA ( rRNA ) Chlamydia trachomatis and/or Neisseria gonorrhoeae clinician-collected endocervical , vaginal ( VS-C ) , male urethral swab specimen , SOVS specimens ( obtain clinic ) , female male urine specimen . The assay FDA clear use specimen symptomatic asymptomatic individual .</detailed_description>
