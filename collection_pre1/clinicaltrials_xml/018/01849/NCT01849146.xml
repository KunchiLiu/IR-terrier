	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 give together radiation therapy temozolomide treat patient newly diagnose glioblastoma come back . WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Radiation therapy use high energy x ray kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 , radiation therapy , temozolomide may work well treat patient newly diagnose recurrent glioblastoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerated dos ( MTD ) AZD1775 ( MK-1775 ) ( WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 ) combination current standard care ( radiotherapy/temozolomide concomitant therapy temozolomide adjuvant therapy ) treat patient newly diagnose glioblastoma . II . To define MTD AZD1775 ( MK-1775 ) combination 6 week daily ( Monday-Friday [ M-F ] ) radiotherapy ( RT ) concomitant temozolomide ( TMZ ) administer 75 mg/m^2/day patient newly diagnose glioblastoma . ( Arm 1 ) III . To define MTD AZD1775 ( MK-1775 ) combination adjuvant TMZ administer 150 mg/m^2/day-200 mg/m^2/day 5 day every 28 day patient glioblastoma concurrent RT/TMZ . ( Arm 2 ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize safety profile AZD1775 ( MK-1775 ) combination RT concomitant TMZ ( Arm 1 ) AZD1775 ( MK-1775 ) adjuvant TMZ ( Arm 2 ) patient newly diagnose glioblastoma . II . To assess pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile AZD1775 ( MK-1775 ) combination upfront radiation/TMZ adjuvant TMZ patient newly diagnose glioblastoma . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine intratumoral concentration AZD1775 ( MK-1775 ) achieve patient treated putative MTD . II . To characterize time course AZD1775 ( MK-1775 ) extracellular fluid within brain tumor follow single oral dose drug microdialysis . III . To characterize pharmacodynamic effect AZD1775 tumor immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) analysis pRb ( S807/811 ) , proliferation ( e.g . Ki-67 ) , pCDC2 , Wee1 , apoptosis ( e.g . cleave caspase 3 ) resect tumor expose drug . IV . To characterize MGMT methylation P53 pathway status , also P-gp wee1 expression level patient newly diagnose glioblastoma treat standard therapy combination AZD1775 ( MK-1775 ) . V. To explore analyze adaptive resistance mechanism AZD1775 use proteogenomics , connect data spatially resolve drug distribution target , imaging-based quantification drug efficacy tumor response . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 . Patients assign 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : INITIATION COURSE : Patients receive WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 orally ( PO ) day 1 , 3 , 5 1-5 weekly temozolomide PO daily ( QD ) 6 week . Patients also undergo concurrent radiation therapy 5 day per week 6 week . MAINTENANCE COURSES : Beginning week 10 , patient receive temozolomide PO QD day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive WEE1 inhibitor AZD1775 PO QD day 1 , 3 , 5 1-5 , temozolomide PO QD day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 2 month 2 year , every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
