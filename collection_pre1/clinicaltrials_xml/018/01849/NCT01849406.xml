	<brief_summary>It anecdotally well know patient snore nose block . However , therapeutic effect improve nasal airway patency snore index remain point conjecture . Indeed , Braver et al examined effect nasal vasoconstrictor fail show improvement number snore application , although apnoea-hypopnoea index ( AHI ) seem decrease . Furthermore , Hoffstein et al document dilation anterior naris patient without nasal pathology relatively weak effect snoring , routine use nasal dilate appliance recommend treatment snoring . In contrast aforementioned study , intranasal corticosteroid show improve sleepiness reduce AHI patient obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) imply might equivalent result use nasal steroid snore index . Additionally , present author demonstrate strong correlation apnoea-hypopnoea index oral/oro-nasal breathing epoch patient OSA normal nasal resistance nasal surgery effective OSA patient preoperatively decrease nasal breathe epoch . It plausible thus suggest snore severity , equivalence OSA severity , might associate oral/oro-nasal breathing epoch improve nasal patency nasal steroid might also increase nasal breathe epochs lead decrease snoring index patient decrease nasal breathe administration nasal steroid . Patients randomize two group : patient first group undergo one week therapy nasal budesonide , two week washout period , thereafter one week nasal normal saline . The patient second group undergo one week therapy nasal normal saline , two week washout period , thereafter one week nasal budesonide . Before treatment regimen patient undergo assessment , consist anterior rhinomanometry polysomnography concomitant measurement snore index breathe route pattern . The investigator hypothesize application one week nasal budesonide beneficial effect snore index patient present application decrease proportion nasal breathe epochs nasal budesonide succeed increase nasal breathe epoch .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Nasal Steroids Snoring Intensity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Snoring intensity would measure use calibrated microphone-sound meter system . The 2 microphone suspend distance 1 approximately surface patient 's bed . This arrangement allow non-invasive measurement snore simulates distance sleep bed partner . Before every study system would acoustically calibrate use reference noise produce noise generator ( 86 dB ) . The signal would send sample rate 12 KHz analogue-digital converter computer system subsequent analysis . All digitized signal record hard disk personal computer . A noise analyzer ( Praat ; Boersma 2005 ) use intensity analysis snore sound ( Boersma , 2005 ) .</detailed_description>
