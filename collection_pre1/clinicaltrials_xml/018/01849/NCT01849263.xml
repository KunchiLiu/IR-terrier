	<brief_title>Ibrutinib Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate overall response rate ibrutinib patient relapse refractory follicular lymphoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess safety tolerability ibrutinib patient follicular lymphoma . II . Evaluate overall survival , time response , duration response , progression-free survival , time treatment failure , time subsequent treatment . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Describe relationship interim positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) scan result , CT response , response duration . II . Biomarker study include explore association ibrutinib response somatic mutation identify follicular lymphoma , whole transcriptome shotgun sequence ( ribonucleic acid-sequencing [ RNA-seq ] ) , exploration inhibition Bruton 's tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) kinases , expression cytokine , chemokines , protein aim develop predictor response resistance . III . Assess change various cancer-derived molecule blood course treatment ibrutinib . IV . As part ongoing research Phase II Consortium ( P2C ) study , bank paraffin-embedded tissue blocks/slides blood product future study . OUTLINE : Patients receive ibrutinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients progressive disease end course 2 may continue therapy end course 5 discretion treat physician . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month progressive disease , every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
