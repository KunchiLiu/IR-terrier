	<criteria>Key Diagnosis LGS carcinoma ovary , fallopian tube primary peritoneum ( invasive micropapillary serous carcinoma invasive grade 1 serous carcinoma ) , confirm histologically verified central pathology review . Recurrent persistent measurable disease progress ( defined radiological and/or clinical progression ; increase cancer antigen [ CA ] 125 alone sufficient ) last therapy ( i.e. , chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , surgery ) amenable potentially curative intent surgery , determine patient 's treating physician . Must receive least 1 prior platinumbased chemotherapy regimen receive 3 line prior chemotherapy regimen , limit number line prior hormonal therapy . Frontline therapy may include neoadjuvant adjuvant therapy count 1 prior systemic regimen . Biological therapy ( e.g . bevacizumab ) administer single agent consider prior systemic regimen prior chemotherapy regimen . Maintenance therapy consider regimen include regimen follow . Available archival tumor sample ( excisional core biopsy ) confirmation LGS carcinoma diagnosis . If adequate archival tumor sample available , willingness consent tissue biopsy . Suitable treatment least one physician 's choice chemotherapy option ( liposomal doxorubicin , paclitaxel topotecan ) determine Investigator . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( PS ) 0 1 . Additional criterion exist . Key History current evidence retinal vein occlusion ( RVO ) current risk factor RVO ( e.g. , uncontrolled glaucoma ocular hypertension , history hyperviscosity hypercoagulability syndrome ) . Prior therapy MEK BRAF inhibitor . History Gilbert 's syndrome . Impaired cardiovascular function clinically significant cardiovascular disease . Uncontrolled symptomatic brain metastasis stable require steroid , potentially lifethreatening require radiation within 28 day prior first dose study treatment . Concomitant malignancies previous malignancy less 5year diseasefree interval time first dose study treatment ; patient adequately resect basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , carcinoma situ cervix ductal carcinoma situ may enrol irrespective time diagnosis . Known positive serology human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , active hepatitis B and/or active hepatitis C. Prior randomization clinical study . Additional criterion exist .</criteria>
