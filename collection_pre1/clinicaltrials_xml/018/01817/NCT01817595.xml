	<brief_summary>Background With emergence internet , health care professional change way approach diabetes management . Internet Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems ( IBGMS ) aim keep blood glucose level normal range acceptable level prevent complication associate diabetes . The Principal Investigators complete randomized clinical trial support efficacy IBGMS ( 1,2 ) . Patient satisfaction report platform essential encourage patient report participation IBGMS . In study , wish compare two different type meter use internet blood glucose monitoring : BG Star Meter ( Conventional Meter ) , iBG Star Group ( iPhone Technology ) . Purpose Rationale Patients satisfy meter internet reporting platform likely participate internet monitoring system . Patients often lack motivation report endocrinologist . With increased reporting healthcare professional , patient likely benefit system . This study aim compare two type meter respective internet reporting platform encourage patient participation . Objectives Our main goal compare two type meter . Primary Outcomes Include : 1 . Patient Satisfaction measure `` Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire '' ( DTSQ ) 2 . Frequency report endocrinologist 3 . Number Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose ( SMBG ) test 4 . Time take teach patient platform Research Design/Methods Sample Size : 50 patient randomize two group : BG Star Group ( Conventional Meter ) 25 patient use ( conventional ) BG star meter patient upload reading onto computer send reading via email . IBG Star Group ( iPhone Technology ) 25 patient randomize iBGstar system upload reading iPhone send reading use iPhone . Patients recruit Physician 's private office . Both ( Conventional meter ) BG star iBG star ( iPhone Technology ) group ask perform SMBG 3 time per day upload meter glucose value online every 2 week review doctor . Inclusion criterion : - Type 1 - Type 2 , insulin , oral antihyperglycemic agent , combination . - Willingness test blood glucose level minimum 3 time daily - Willingness randomize - Trained self-blood glucose monitoring - Internet Access Exclusion criterion : Patients meet criterion willing participate include study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background/Hypothesis Management diabetes evolve challenge health care professional . The fluctuation glucose level lifetime patient diabetes lead complication nephropathy , neuropathy , retinopathy cardiovascular disease . Although diabetes chronic disease , control use medication ( oral agent insulin ) , and/or change life-style diet . With emergence internet , health care professional change way approach diabetes management . Internet Blood Glucose Monitoring Systems ( IBGMS ) aim keep blood glucose level normal range acceptable level prevent complication associate diabetes . The Principal Investigators complete randomized clinical trial support efficacy IBGMS ( 1,2 ) . Patient satisfaction report platform essential patient report participation IBGMS . In study , wish compare two different type meter use internet blood glucose monitoring : BG Star Meter ( Conventional Meter ) , iBG Star Group ( iPhone Technology ) .

Inclusion criterion : - Type 1 - Type 2 , insulin , oral antihyperglycemic agent , combination . - Willingness test blood glucose level minimum 3 time daily - Willingness randomize - Trained self-blood glucose monitoring - Internet Access Exclusion criterion : Patients meet criterion willing participate include study . Confidentiality According guideline University British Columbia ( UBC ) /Providence Health Care Research Ethics Boards , identity participant keep confidential . Data patient collect Clinical Research Coordinator Internet base glucose monitoring system . These data access investigator inputted ExcelÂ® spreadsheet patient give unique identifier . All data pertain individual patient keep locked office study investigator . Calculations Statistics Statistical analysis perform site researcher . Each group complete DTSQ . Questions revolve around satisfaction treatment answer scale 1 ( dissatisfy ) 6 ( Satisfied ) . Frequency report determined number report send per month . Total strip count record group . Time measured time take train patient respective meter/platform . All outcome measurement analyse use independent sample t-tests . Participants identify coded initial number protect privacy .</detailed_description>
