	<brief_summary>New approach need prevent growth failure child low- middle-income country ( LMIC ) . To date , nutrition intervention study focus micronutrient energy content complementary food yield small moderate effect growth development . There appear miss link mediates reduces expect beneficial effect . Child population LMIC show asymptomatic environmental enteropathy characterize reduced size small intestinal villus , decrease gut integrity chronic inflammatory response gut . Results study industrialized country suggest ω3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid ( ω3 LCPUFAs ) improve immune response gut integrity . These report beneficial effect could result even important physiological implication child LMIC ultimately contribute healthy growth development . The hypothesis OME³Jim study increase intake ω3 LCPUFAs complementary food human milk effect infant growth development context high malnutrition rate low ω3 LCPUFAs intake . This study identify whether intake either mother infant effective . The specific objective OME³Jim study : 1 . To test effect supplement infant ω3 LCPUFAs fortify food supplement infant growth , morbidity , nutritional status development ; 2 . To test effect supplement lactate mother ω3 LCPUFAs oil capsule infant growth , nutritional status development ; 3 . To test combined effect ( dose response ) supplement ω3 LCPUFAs lactate mother infant infant growth , morbidity , nutritional status development : 4 . To test effect ω3 LCPUFAs supplementation ω3 LCPUFA status infant human milk .</brief_summary>
