	<brief_summary>This research perform try understand use deep brain stimulation DBS treat symptom Tourette syndrome respond well current medication . In order investigator place small stimulation lead side brain region ( portion thalamus ) may alter abnormal activity brain contributing symptom Tourette syndrome . This require two surgical procedure , several preoperative postoperative visit tune stimulation parameter record stimulation effect . The FDA approve DBS use people Tourette syndrome , Medtronic ( manufacturer device ) conduct test system Tourette syndrome . Therefore use study experimental .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Males females &gt; =25 year age . There strict age cutoff upper limit inclusion , however subject may meet exclusion criterion base medical contraindication deep brain stimulation surgery ( Points 3. 6. Exclusion Criteria ) . NonEnglish speaker include study . 2 . Subject diagnosis TS determine review medical record , discussion refer psychiatrist well DSMIV criterion videotape assessment . 3 . Subject determine treatmentresistant least one year prior Screening Visit demonstrate clinical evidence ( determine review medical record discussion refer psychiatrist neurologist ) persistent functionally impair tic respond treatment minimum three adequate regimen medication include two failed trial least one typical neuroleptic one atypical neuroleptic medication , along one fail trial first tier medication define follow : 1 . Adequate trial one nonneuroleptic medication include drug follow ( first tier ) list : clonidine , guanfacine , topiramate , baclofen , levetiracetam , clonazepam . Trial failure define demonstrated lack efficacy severe side effect . 2 . Two adequate trial least one typical neuroleptic medication ( pimozide , fluphenazine , haloperidol ) least one atypical neuroleptic ( risperidone , aripiprazole , ziprasidone , olanzapine , quetiapine ) . Trial failure define demonstrated lack efficacy severe side effect . 4 . A mandatory trial behavioral intervention attempt reduce severity tic comorbid symptom must also complete subject offer participation trial . This may include habit reversal therapy , stress reduction therapy , behavioral therapy investigation tic suppression . 5 . Subject significant vocal motor tic tic subscale score least 35 YGTSS ( Yale Global Tic Severity Scale ) three Baseline Visits prior undergo surgery . 6 . All aspect subject 's care must optimize precede 6 month admission study . This include treatment comorbid medical , neurological , psychiatric disorder . Additionally , include psychological intervention ongoing psychosocial problem subject may precede 6 month study admission . 7 . Subject must ambulatory . 8 . Females postmenopausal , physically incapable childbearing , practice acceptable method birth control . Acceptable method birth control include surgical sterilization , hormonal contraceptive , doublebarrier method ( condom diaphragm spermicidal agent intrauterine device [ IUD ] ) . If practice acceptable method birth control , negative urine pregnancy test result obtain baseline Visits 1 3 . 9 . Subject determine independent psychiatrist expertise capacity assessment decisionmaking capacity provide inform consent . 10 . Subject able read English , understand cooperate study procedure , sign write informed consent form prior study procedure . 1 . Subject positive urine drug screen three Baseline Visits . 2 . Subject major surgery within three month prior Baseline Visit 1 surgery plan propose study period . 3 . Subject determine medical consultant medical contraindication undergo surgery . 4 . Subject pregnant breastfeeding . 5 . Subject history alcohol drug abuse within past 6 month and/or dependence within past year . 6 . Subject medical illness/condition , and/or abnormal diagnostic finding would interfere completion study , confound result study , pose risk patient . 7 . Subject untreated uncontrolled Axis I disorder include major depression , bipolar disorder , schizophrenia determine screen psychiatrist . 8 . Subject past history major psychiatric disorder ( Tourette Syndrome associate ADHD OCD ) . 9 . Subject either current past history suicidal ideation and/or intent . 10 . Subject tic disorder movement disorder attributable another medical , neurological , psychiatric disorder Tourette Syndrome . 11 . Subject druginduced tic disorder . 12 . Subject significant psychosocial factor might increase risk DBS procedure complicate recovery outcome assessment . ( Examples include history noncompliance previous medical psychosocial treatment , multiple fail medication treatment inadequate dose duration , history multiple surgical procedure poor outcome , unexplained medical history gap , pending lawsuit legal action . ) 13 . Subject metal head type implant stimulator ( i.e . cardiac pacemaker , deep brain stimulator different disease , spinal cord stimulator , cochlear implant , vagus nerve stimulator , etc. ) . 14 . Subject participate another investigational drug trial therapeutic trial within 30 day Baseline Visit 1 . 15 . Subject diagnosis mental retardation . 16 . Subject neurological condition , history traumatic brain injury associate loss consciousness &gt; 1 hour and/or intracranial/epidural/subdural bleeding .</criteria>
