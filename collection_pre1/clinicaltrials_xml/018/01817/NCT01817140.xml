	<brief_summary>The primary objective study improve diagnostic accuracy specificity MRI detect degree bone involvement invasion oral cancer . The presence degree bone invasion determine extent surgery great effect morbidity patient oral cancer bone/soft tissue tumor . MRI scan 3 Tesla ( 3T ) 4Tesla ( 4T ) MR magnet perform 10 patient possible maxillofacial and/or mandibular bone invasion . We compare conventional imaging result patient 3T 4T MRI result post operative pathology result .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Mandibular Bone Invasion With MRI Using SWIFT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Unfortunately , detect bone invasion extension bone involvement prior surgery often difficult currently available image technique . MRI high contrast resolution ability perform multiplanar image play integral role delineation tumoral involvement bone . Although MRI excellent tool assessment bone invasion carcinoma , overestimation cortical invasion tumor extent bone marrow diagnostic challenge , lead false positive result . Like many musculoskeletal system tissue , cortical bone produce signal conventional MRI technique , limit characterization image contrast differentiation adjacent soft tissue . A novel MRI technique call Sweep Imaging Fourier Transformation ( SWIFT ) appear suitable tool overcome challenge . The main advantage SWIFT obtain signal cortical bone . We believe SWIFT technique overcome false positive result . Patients enrol study ask come Center Magnetic Resonance Research ( CMRR ) University Minnesota , Minneapolis , Minnesota schedule MRI . Brief scan obtain ( less 1 minute ) localize area interest . Longer MRI scan ( around 5-15 minute ) obtain . The total time require scan 1 hour . To determine well MR image predict presence mandibular invasion , compare result clinical , operative , radiological pathological finding . Thus , patient ask give permission investigator access relevant medical record .</detailed_description>
