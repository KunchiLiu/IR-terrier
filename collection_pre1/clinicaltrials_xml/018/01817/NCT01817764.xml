	<brief_summary>This multicenter , randomize , double-blind , double-dummy , parallel group study . The purpose study compare efficacy safety umeclidinium/vilanterol ( UMEC/VI ) fluticasone propionate/salmeterol ( FSC ) subject COPD . Subjects meet eligibility criterion Screening complete 7 14 day Run-in period . At end run-in period , approximately 710 eligible subject equally randomize ( complete least 568 evaluable subject ) one 2 treatment group 12 week : 1 . UMEC/VI 62.5/25 microgram ( mcg ) administer one inhalation once-daily morning via Novel dry powder inhaler ( NDPI ) + placebo administer one inhalation morning evening via single multidose powder inhaler ( ACCUHALER/DISKUS ) 2 . FSC 250/50 mcg administer one inhalation morning even via ACCUHALER/DISKUS + placebo administer once-daily morning via NDPI . A safety Follow-up assessment conduct approximately 7 day end study treatment ( Early Withdrawal , applicable ) . The total duration subject participation approximately 15 week .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Type subject : Outpatient A sign date write informed consent prior study participation Male female subject , 40 year age old Visit 1 A female eligible enter participate study : Nonchild bear potential ( i.e . physiologically incapable become pregnant , include female postmenopausal surgically sterile ) . A female eligible enter participate study : Child bear potential , negative pregnancy test screening , agree one follow acceptable contraceptive method list protocol use consistently correctly . An established clinical history COPD accordance definition American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society follow : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease preventable treatable disease state characterize airflow limitation fully reversible . The airflow limitation usually progressive associate abnormal inflammatory response lungs noxious particle gas , primarily cause cigarette smoking . Although COPD affect lung , also produce significant systemic consequence Smoking history : Current former cigarette smoker history cigarette smoke &gt; =10 packyears ( number pack year = [ number cigarette per day/20 ] x number year smoke [ e.g. , 20 cigarette per day 10 year , 10 cigarette per day 20 year ] ) . Previous smoker define stop smoke least 6 month prior Visit 1 . Pipe and/or cigar use use calculate pack year history Severity disease : A pre postsalbutamol FEV1/Forced Vital Capacity ( FVC ) ratio &lt; 0.70 postsalbutamol FEV1 &gt; =30 % &lt; =70 % predict normal value calculate use National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES ) III reference equation Visit 1 Dyspnea : A score &gt; =2 Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale ( mMRC ) Visit 1 Women pregnant lactate plan become pregnant study A current diagnosis asthma Other Respiratory Disorders : Known Î±1 antitrypsin deficiency , active lung infection ( tuberculosis ) , lung cancer absolute exclusionary condition . A subject , , opinion investigator , significant respiratory condition addition COPD exclude . Examples may include clinically significant bronchiectasis , pulmonary hypertension , sarcoidosis , interstitial lung disease . Inactive tuberculosis one lobe exclusionary . Allergic rhinitis exclusionary Other Diseases/Abnormalities : Subjects historical current evidence clinically significant cardiovascular , neurological , psychiatric , renal , hepatic , immunological , endocrine ( include uncontrolled diabetes thyroid disease ) hematological abnormality uncontrolled and/or previous history cancer remission &lt; 5 year prior Visit 1 ( localize carcinoma skin resect cure exclusionary ) . Significant defined disease , opinion investigator , would put safety subject risk participation , would affect efficacy safety analysis disease/condition exacerbate study Contraindications : A history allergy hypersensitivity anticholinergic/muscarinic receptor antagonist , beta2agonist , corticosteroid , lactose/milk protein magnesium stearate medical condition narrowangle glaucoma , prostatic hypertrophy bladder neck obstruction , opinion study physician contraindicates study participation use inhale anticholinergic Hospitalization pneumonia within 12 week prior Visit 1 History COPD Exacerbation : A documented history least one COPD exacerbation 12 month prior Visit 1 require either oral corticosteroid , antibiotic , and/or hospitalization . Prior use antibiotic alone qualify exacerbation history unless use associate treatment worsen symptom COPD , increase dyspnea , sputum volume , sputum purulence Lung Resection : Subjects lung volume reduction surgery within 12 month prior Screening ( Visit 1 ) 12Lead Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) : An abnormal significant ECG find 12lead ECG conduct Visit 1 . Investigators provide ECG review conduct centralized independent cardiologist assist evaluation subject eligibility . Medication Prior Spirometry : Unable withhold salbutamol 4 hour period require prior spirometry test study visit Medications Prior Screening : Use follow medication accord follow defined time interval prior Visit 1 : Depot corticosteroids 12 week , Systemic , oral parenteral corticosteroid 6 week , Antibiotics ( low respiratory tract infection ) 6 week , Cytochrome P450 3A4 strong inhibitor 6 week , Herbal medication potentially contain oral systemic steroid 6 week , Inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) 30 day , Longacting beta2agonist ( LABA ) /ICS combination product 30 day , Phosphodiesterase 4 ( PDE4 ) inhibitor ( e.g. , roflumilast ) 14 day , Inhaled longacting anticholinergic 7 day , Theophyllines 48 hour , Oral leukotriene inhibitor ( zafirlukast , montelukast , zileuton ) 48 hour , Oral beta2agonists Longacting48 hours/Shortacting 12 hour , Inhaled long act beta2agonists ( LABA , e.g. , salmeterol , formoterol , indacaterol ) 48 hour , Inhaled sodium cromoglycate nedocromil sodium 24 hour , Inhaled short act beta2agonists 4 hour , Inhaled shortacting anticholinergic 4 hour , Inhaled shortacting anticholinergic/shortacting beta2agonist combination product 4 hour , Any investigational medication 30 day within 5 drug halflives ( whichever longer ) Oxygen : Use longterm oxygen therapy ( LTOT ) describe oxygen therapy prescribe great 12 hour day . Asneeded oxygen use ( i.e. , &lt; =12 hour per day ) exclusionary Nebulized Therapy : Regular use ( prescribe use every day , asneeded use ) shortacting bronchodilator ( e.g. , salbutamol ) via nebulized therapy . Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program : Participation acute phase pulmonary rehabilitation program within 4 week prior Visit 1 . Subjects maintenance phase pulmonary rehabilitation program exclude Drug Alcohol Abuse : A know suspected history alcohol drug abuse within 2 year prior Visit 1 Affiliation Investigator Site : A subject eligible study he/she immediate family member participate investigator , subinvestigator , study coordinator , employee participate investigator Inability read : A subject eligible study opinion investigator subject read</criteria>
