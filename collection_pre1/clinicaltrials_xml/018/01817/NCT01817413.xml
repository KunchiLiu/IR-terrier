	<brief_summary>Children often damage front teeth . In approximately 6 % case , nerve inside affect tooth dy ( become 'non-vital ' ) natural root development stop . In case , tooth require root canal treatment order prevent problem pain dental abscess arise . However , root young teeth fully form , weak prone fracture . In addition , root canal treatment difficult root canal filling place tooth yet fully form , due fact root 'open ' end . To enable root canal treatment carry , 'barrier ' must place end 'open ' root . This do use material call Calcium Hydroxide Mineral Trioxide Aggregate ( MTA ) . These material place inside root seal tooth . However , although help provide barrier , help strengthen wall root . Treatment material require multiple visit dentist , period 18 month . There evidence suggest alternative treatment involve 'revascularisation ' ( recovery blood supply tooth ) use triple antibiotic paste allow 'natural ' root growth restart , also strengthen wall root . Treatment often carry two visit . The aim study discover whether difference one two method treat non-vital teeth open end . It think significant difference see result two technique . Children teeth fall category require root canal treatment give one two treatment , aim treat infection , close root end allow heal take place . Teeth receive one follow method root treatment : 1 . Revascularisation ( recovery natural blood supply tooth ) follow placement antibiotic paste tooth root . The aim treatment allow 'natural ' root growth restart . Root growth allow tooth form barrier end root . No root canal filling necessary . 2 . Closure open root end placement artificial barrier end root root canal filling place . This do dental material call Mineral Trioxide Aggregate ( MTA ) . Non-vital teeth open end routinely treated way Liverpool Dental Hospital .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Two Dental Techniques Used Treat Teeth Which Have Become Infected Painful Following Trauma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants randomly allocate one treatment group . This mean neither participant , researcher , able choose group participant allocate . In technique , order learn bacteria involve non-vital teeth , investigator take sample bacteria within root canal . The outcome study provide u information root growth , bacteria involve infection non-vital teeth success different treatment method available . This information enable u increase understanding treatment non-vital teeth open end help u explain treatment future patient . All child present Liverpool University Dental Hospital age 7 25 year age medically well cooperative receive prolong treatment dental chair eligible take part study damage upper front adult tooth nerve die root open end . Unfortunately , dental decay tooth fracture root teeth suitable study . In case follow damage tooth , root tooth start dissolve unfortunately teeth also suitable study . Suitable patient attend parent carer consultation Paediatric Dentistry Clinic Liverpool University Dental Hospital . Following visit , suitable patient wish join study investigator arrange two visit dental treatment take place . Following completion treatment , patient ask return four check ups next year investigator check happy treatment successful . There risk disadvantage take part study . However , tooth respond treatment , symptoms infection arise , alternative treatment method may initiate necessary . The study fund Royal Liverpool Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust University Liverpool .</detailed_description>
