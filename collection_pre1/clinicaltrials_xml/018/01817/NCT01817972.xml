	<criteria>1 . The patient sign Informed Consent Form ( ICF ) . 2 . The patient ambulatory , communitydwelling male nonpregnant female age 18 70 year Screening Visit . Lactating female must agree breastfeed . 3 . Sexually active female patient childbearing potential must agree use one follow method birth control date sign ICF conclusion trial : a. Hormonal contraception ( i.e . oral contraceptive , contraceptive implant , injectable hormonal contraceptive ) b. Doublebarrier birth control ( e.g . condom plus intrauterine device , diaphragm plus spermicide ) c. Surgical sterilization ( i.e . bilateral oophorectomy , hysterectomy , tubal ligation ) d. Maintenance monogamous relationship male partner surgically sterilize vasectomy 4 . Females childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test Randomization Visit ( first study treatment visit ) prior dose . 5 . Patient clinically significant finding physical examination , 12lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) clinical laboratory test ( clinical chemistry panel , complete blood count [ CBC ] , urinalysis [ UA ] ) sign ICF receive first dose study drug . ( Note : The Investigator determine particular find clinically significant . In make determination , investigator consider whether particular finding could prevent patient perform protocolspecified assessment , could represent condition would exclude patient trial , could represent safety concern patient participate trial , could confound trialspecified assessment safety efficacy . ) 6 . Patient fluent English . 7 . Are consider eligible accord follow TB screen criterion : • Have history latent active TB prior screen . An exception make patient history latent TB documentation complete appropriate treatment latent TB within 3 year prior first administration study agent . Appropriate documentation verify treatment antituberculous treatment must establish prior study participation . • Have sign symptom suggestive active TB upon medical history and/or physical examination . • Have recent close contact person active TB . • Subject negative purify protein derivative test within 30 day prior first dose . Tuberculin skin test consider positive great equal 5 mm induration 48 72 hour test place . Subjects positive tuberculin skin test ( less equal 14 mm induration ) allow history Bacillus CalmetteGuerin vaccination negative Quantiferon test past year , symptom per tuberculosis workup , negative chest Xray . 8 . Be able adhere require study visit schedule comply note protocol requirement . 9 . Subject establish ileal , ileocolonic , colonic Crohn 's disease minimum 3 month . 10 . Subject moderately severely active Crohn 's disease , define Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ( CDAI ) score 225 450 screen baseline must also SES score fall auspice moderate moderately severe disease ( 1015 ) . 11 . Subject evidence active inflammation , demonstrate following : Elevated C reactive protein ( CRP ) screening ( &gt; 2.87 mg/L , upper limit normal ( ULN ) set local laboratory ) Endoscopic evidence inflammation screen period within 8 week prior screen period 12 . Subjects allow continue concurrent treatment follow agent : 5aminosalicylates , stable dosage least 2 week prior screen ( dosage maintain throughout trial ) Probiotics , provide dose stable 2 week prior enrollment Antidiarrheals ( eg , loperamide , Imodium ) control chronic diarrhea ; per standard CDAI protocol , use antidiarrheal assess visit . Additional eligibility information SESCD The subject diagnosis active moderate severe CD screen specific finding : presence large ulceration ( 0.5cm minimal diameter size categorize large also constitute 23 point SESCD score ) , extent ulcerated surface ( minimal percentage get least 10 % also constitute 23 point SESCD score ) , extent affect surface ( 50 % minimal percentage fall moderate category would constitute 23 point SESCD score ) finally presence type narrow find ( number strictures find colonoscope pass pass also constitute 23 point SESCD score ) . The minimal score 10 15 . The local endoscopist ( investigator ) determine whether subject meet entrance criterion SES score perspective . An appendix attach define table simple endoscopic score Crohn 's Disease ( Appendix 1 ) . CDAI Crohn 's Disease Activity Index scoring : consists eight variable include five subject report outcome . Variables 1,2,3,4 5 obtain patient 's diary ( see table 2a , subject diary , Appendix 2 , Crohn 's Disease Activity Index Variables ) complete patient 7 day prior CDAI evaluation . The Standard Height Weight Table ( Table 2b ) must use calculate variable 8 . The score variable weight apply multiplier show . The total CDAI score determine calculate sum individual , weighted score . A minimum score 225 point require exceed 450 . These two primary criterion entry study outcome propose . 1 . The patient condition , include clinically significant abnormality Screening laboratory test and/or medical history find Screening assessment , acute chronic condition , , opinion investigator , constitute risk patient contraindication participation completion study , could interfere study objective , conduct , evaluation ( unstable diabetes mellitus , thyroid disease , vascular disease , endstage coronary disease , pulmonary disease , liver disease , renal disease metabolic disorder also uncontrolled ) . 2 . The patient major surgery schedule study period . 3 . The patient history cancer , except adequately treat basal cell carcinoma skin , cervical dysplasia , carcinoma situ skin cervix . 4 . Are pregnant , nursing , plan pregnancy ( men woman ) trial 6month period thereafter . 5 . Have show previous immediate hypersensitivity response , include anaphylaxis , immunoglobulin product ( plasmaderived recombinant , e.g . monoclonal antibody ) . 6 . Have receive within 3 month prior screen expect receive live viral ( e.g . smallpox ) live bacterial vaccination trial 3 month last administration study agent . 7 . Have evidence active infection time randomization serious infection relate CD ( e.g. , hepatitis , pneumonia , pyelonephritis ) , within 6 month prior screen . 8 . Have opportunistic infection ( e.g. , herpes zoster [ shingle ] , cytomegalovirus , Pneumocystis carinii , aspergillosis , histoplasmosis , mycobacteria TB ) within 6 month prior screen . Have current active hepatitis B ( include chronic active hepatitis B asymptomatic carrier state [ hepatitis B surface antigen positive ; HBsAgpositive ] ) history hepatitis C infection . 9 . Chronic pancreatitis . 10 . Have condition , opinion investigator , would compromise wellbeing patient study prevent patient meeting perform study requirement . 11 . Have multiple sclerosis central demyelinate disorder . 12 . Have history lymphoproliferative disease include lymphoma , sign symptom suggestive possible lymphoproliferative disease , lymphadenopathy unusual size location ( e.g. , node posterior triangle neck , intraclavicular , epitrochlear , periaortic area ) , splenomegaly . 13 .
