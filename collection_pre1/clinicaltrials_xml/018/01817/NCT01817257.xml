	<detailed_description>Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) term describe blood clot legs know deep vein thrombus ( DVT ) lung , know pulmonary embolus ( PE ) . It common condition , cause many symptom include leg pain , swell , chest pain breathlessness . At serious , VTE may lead sudden collapse death . Treating VTE cost UK National Health Service ( NHS ) £640 million every year , include long-term complication experience nearly third patient . VTE treatment usually consist three six month blood thin medicine know anticoagulant . For patient , tablet call warfarin use , require regular blood test ensure blood adequately safely thin . We also know VTE particularly common cancer . In UK , 250,000 people diagnosed year cancer , nearly fifth develop VTE . Warfarin potentially risky treatment cancer patient may increase risk bleed . Also , VTE may come back fifth patient treat warfarin . Research show medicine know low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) good warfarin treat VTE cancer patient decrease chance VTE come back half . LMWH give injection day . Studies show give drug injection acceptable patient , patient prefer regular blood test need warfarin monitoring . LMWH also simpler use since cause problem patient take medicine common problem patient take warfarin . Cancer patient get VTE cancer make blood sticky make likely clot . It recommend patient take LMWH six month . However , someone still cancer six month treatment LMWH , still strong chance VTE could come back cancer cause blood clot go away . This mean patient might benefit take LMWH longer six month . We know though whether would improve patient ' quality life , help prevent death , cost-effective NHS . To help decide continue LMWH would benefit patient , need compare effect continue LMWH extra six month effect continue LMWH clinical trial . Because do , first thing need see would possible carry full clinical trial patient . In word , able recruit enough patient , LMWH good treatment reasonable cost ? To help answer question , propose call feasibility trial . This feasibility trial compare patient continue take LMWH six month patient continue take LMWH . Patients cancer , take LMWH five month VTE , recruit oncology haematology outpatient department GP practice . Patients approach take part study ask would willing continue LMWH six month part research study . If say yes , chosen random either receive LMWH six month ( intervention group ) , stop LMWH six month , usual care ( control group ) . We follow patient six month recruitment ask complete questionnaire three monthly interval . These questionnaire ask symptom quality life . We interview patient wish consent study explore reason . We also interview patient consent study , later withdraw study explore experience reason withdrawal . We also explore view clinician towards continuation LMWH feel trial . Focus group hold two group clinician care set . By collect information , able explore whether continue LMWH something acceptable patient health care professional side effect continue LMWH . The research team make experienced researcher health care setting ( GPs , hospital doctor nurse health care professional work charity organisation ) . They support approve clinical trial unit , experience run large study area . The team member also link many national international professional , policy patient group , essential help report finding study .</detailed_description>
