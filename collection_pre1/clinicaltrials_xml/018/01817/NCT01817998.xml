	<brief_summary>Background study concept : Atrial fibrillation new global epidemic cardiology . With improved survival cardiovascular disease longer live general , incidence prevalence AF rise dramatically developed country estimate life time risk one four people age 40 year . Similarly Denmark , prevalence estimate almost double within 2020 . It fatal arrhythmia double mortality compare patient normal sinus rhythm ; primarily cause increase risk stroke heart failure . In particular stroke fear complication 70 % risk fatal outcome lasting handicap immense cost patient well term health cost . Moreover , many AF patient experience variety symptom markedly reduce quality life . Opposed heart failure patient patient suffer myocardial infarction , AF patient offer sort rehabilitation diagnose . Pharmacological treatment arrhythmia challenge . Most often , individual careful risk evaluation include ultrasound heart obligatory choose optimal treatment strategy prophylactic anticoagulation . In case new anti-arrhythmic drug start restore maintain sinus rhythm , hospitalization least two day heart rhythm monitoring require detect possible potentially dangerous even fatal arrhythmia side effect treatment . Additionally , first new oral anti-arrhythmic AF drug introduce twenty-five year prove hazardous high-risk AF population use strict precaution . To explore role alternative treatment strategy renew handle cardiac arrhythmia , therefore set study role physical exercise AF patient . Our specific study aim examine : 1 . The effect physical exercise AF burden 2 . The effect physical exercise risk cardiovascular hospitalization Method : Our study interventional , randomized exercise study . 60 patient old 18 year ECG-documented AF include write informed consent obtain . They randomize 1:1 moderate-severe ( 80-85 % max capacity ) low intensity ( 50 % max capacity ) training . Exclusion criterion language barrier , illness inherent expect survival shorter year , reason prevent patient training , reveal serious cardiac disease pre-tests , AF ablation within one year , permanent AF . Both group first participate nurse-led educational care program . The program build two individual consultation one team consultation focus education AF . The patient thoroughly examined randomization end training period special ultrasound heart , ECG-monitored test maximal oxygen uptake ergometer bicycle , 24 hour measurement blood pressure pulse , blood sample . They teach use home ECG recorder , new handheld device . The patient send ECG 's twice daily experience cardiac symptom 5 month ( exercise two month ) . When randomized patient divide team ten trained separate team , physiotherapist closely guide patient train correct intensity level . Measurements : During physical exercise burden atrial fibrillation measure tele-ECG i.e . number ECGs atrial fibrillation divide total number ECGs . ECG report begin four week physical exercise continue 2 month last training session . Recording hospitalization begin randomization continue one year last training session . All hospitalization cause AF related AF disease ( relapse AF , heart failure , stroke , new anti-arrhythmic medication , elective electrical cardioversion , complication anticoagulation , pacemaker implantation ) record . Also , total day hospital register . The AF population grow global scale disease attract immense interest international cardiology congress . New knowledge effect train general population well effect set establish disease could paramount effect prognosis , quality life , health cost pharmacological treatment AF still hold challenge .</brief_summary>
