	<brief_summary>The primary objective CSP # 589 VIP-STAR evaluate effectiveness Individual Placement &amp; Support ( IPS ) unemployed Veterans PTSD . The primary hypothesis , compare treat transitional work program ( TWP ) , unemployed Veterans PTSD treat IPS significantly likely become steady worker . A steady worker define hold competitive job great equal 50 % 18-month study follow-up period ( i.e. , great equal 39 78 week ) . All participant follow 18 month post-randomization . 12/14/12 : Analytic plan augment allow sensitivity analysis primary outcome would exclude first 12 week post-randomization , evaluate group proportion steady worker status , define work competitive job great equal 50 % week week 13-78 . 7/1/13 : Analysis plan augment include logistic regression analysis primary outcome , adjust participate medical center . 10/4/13 : Addition IPS-25 Fidelity Scale . The addition IPS-25 scale increase validity study result . 1/15/15 : Addition Interactive Voice Recognition/Web-based ( IVR/Web ) System ; option weekly data capture primary outcome data ( employment history ) . 8/17/15 : Approval Supplemental Data Collection Participant Study Exit ; use data collect supplement study analysis plan , provide insight impact vocational rehab .

	<detailed_description>Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) affect 600,000 US Veterans common psychiatric condition Veterans seek VA disability benefit , make substantial proportion $ 23 billion pension disability annual budget . Although many Veterans PTSD college educate , job , almost 40 % impoverished , report work , role social functioning score person serious mental illness . Veterans return Gulf War-era II conflict , define serve military since Sept 2001 , often experience PTSD confront unemployment upon military discharge . According March 2011 report U.S. Department Labor , 2010 unemployment rate 11.5 % Gulf War-era II Veterans , 21 % service-connected disabled Gulf War-era II Veterans , 13 % service-connected Veterans era combine 9.4 % non Veterans . The current method use VA Compensated Work Therapy ( CWT ) program sufficiently meet employment rehabilitation need Veterans PTSD . In VA Northeast Program Evaluation Center ( NEPEC ) study evaluate administrative data 5,862 Veterans 122 CWT program , Veterans PTSD 19 % le likely employed discharge VA CWT program compare without diagnosis PTSD . The rate competitive employment discharge 30 % Veterans PTSD . Similarly , another VA study find Veterans PTSD involve CWT likely employ 4 month follow-up compare participated specialized PTSD treatment program . Over past two decade study , Individual Placement Support ( IPS ) model Supported Employment yield remarkably robust consistent employment outcome individual serious mental illness ( define schizophrenia , schizoaffective disorder , bipolar disorder , major depression psychotic feature ) . Overall , approximately two-thirds participant clinical trial serious mental illness receive IPS achieve competitive employment . However , Veterans PTSD different clinical characteristic employment challenge compare Veterans SMI . Serving first study PTSD population , recent single site pilot study find superior outcome IPS compare conventional VA vocational rehabilitation program ( VRP ) unemployed Veterans PTSD ( n=85 ) . During 12-month study follow-up period , 76 % Veterans PTSD randomize IPS gain competitive employment , compare 28 % randomize VRP . Together evidence base accumulate serious mentally ill population , positive result pilot study PTSD support VA Cooperative Study definitively test effectiveness IPS Veterans PTSD . As primary outcome , two group compare term proportion study participant meet definition steady worker , i.e. , hold competitive employment least 50 % follow-up period . Competitive employment define job receive regular wage set set aside , shelter , enclaved , , job could hold people without mental illness disability set-aside job TWP program . Secondary outcome include change occupational outcome , PTSD symptom , self esteem , community integration , quality life . We explore difference group term occurrence negative health outcome . These finding would provide generalizable evidence effectiveness differ employment support VHA stakeholder inform policy service delivery Veterans PTSD . Given number Veterans PTSD , critical importance VA offer employment service program base best evidence-based recovery-oriented model group . Conducting large multi-site study next logical step confirm IPS evidence-based employment service Veterans PTSD .</detailed_description>
