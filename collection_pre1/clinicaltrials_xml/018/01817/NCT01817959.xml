	<brief_summary>The chemokine CXCL8 play key role recruitment activation polymorphonuclear neutrophils post-ischemia reperfusion injury organ transplantion . Reparixin first low molecular weight blocker CXCL8 biological activity clinical development . Thus , use reparixin may emerge potential key component sequentially integrated approach immunomodulation control non specific inflammatory event surround early phase pancreatic islet transplantation type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Assess Efficacy &amp; Safety Reparixin Pancreatic Islet Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pancreatic islet transplantation become feasible option treatment T1D offer advantage whole pancreas transplantation . Several strategy evaluate , include anti-TNFα , aim prevent early inflammatory event limit islet engraftment . Among possible mechanism CXCL8 could play crucial role trigger inflammatory reaction might represent relevant therapeutic target prevent early graft failure . Preliminary data obtain transplanted patient recruit ongoing pilot trial couple safety show human phase 1 2 study provide sound rationale development reparixin islet transplantation prompt conduct phase 3 clinical study aim assess efficacy safety reparixin prevent graft dysfunction islet transplantation T1D patient . At least 42 patient receive pancreatic islet transplant involve . Patients may receive 2 islet transplant , second transplant average 6 month first one . Patients randomly ( 2:1 ) assign receive either reparixin placebo ( control group ) . The Investigational Products administer add treatment immunosuppressant regimen .</detailed_description>
