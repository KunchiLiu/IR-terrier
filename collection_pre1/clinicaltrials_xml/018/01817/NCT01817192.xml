	<brief_summary>The optimal treatment stage I non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) remain controversial . Radiographic surveillance alone recommend stage I patient tumor remove surgically lung , standard base fact previous clinical trial demonstrate benefit stage I NSCLC patient receive post-operative chemotherapy . These patient , however , substantial risk death within five year operation , range approximately 30 % 45 % , largely due metastatic disease present immediately surgery undetectable conventional method . Some lead organization therefore currently recommend post-operative chemotherapy alternative standard care stage I NSCLC patient consider particularly high-risk . Up , however , well-validated mean identify stage I NSCLC patient high risk death within five year operation . A new prognostic tool , Pervenio™ Lung RS Assay , validate definitively demonstrate large scale study identify high-risk stage I patient non-squamous NSCLC , available clinician CLIA-certified laboratory . It therefore possible compare outcomes patient randomly assign one competing standard care .</brief_summary>
