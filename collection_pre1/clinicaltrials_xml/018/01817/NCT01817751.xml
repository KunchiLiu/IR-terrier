	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well sorafenib tosylate , valproic acid , sildenafil citrate work treat patient recurrent high-grade glioma . Sorafenib tosylate , valproic acid , sildenafil citrate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sorafenib Tosylate , Valproic Acid , Sildenafil Citrate Treating Patients With Recurrent High-Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The combination sorafenib , valproic acid , sildenafil may therapeutic potential treatment recurrent high-grade glioma clinic . The combination sorafenib valproic acid predicate basis sorafenib activity enhance HDAC inhibition . The addition sildenafil base ability block ABCB1 ABCG2 drug efflux pump . As ABCG2 transporter primary transporter involve efflux sorafenib BBB , block action predict increase concentration sorafenib brain .</detailed_description>
