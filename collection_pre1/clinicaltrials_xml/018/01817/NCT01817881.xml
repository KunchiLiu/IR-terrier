	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether temporal artery thermometer accurate tool temperature measurement patient present Emergency Department . The investigators´ hypothesis difference &gt; 0,3 degree centigrade ( Bland-Altman ) temperatures measured temporal artery thermometer use investigators´ hospital ( Exergen TAT-5000 ) measure rectal thermometer ( OMRON MC-341-E ) , consider gold standard Denmark define Danish Center Clinical Guidelines . The investigator furthermore hypothesize difference measurement great measure patient hyperthermia ( temperature &gt; 37,9 degree Centigrade ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation Accuracy Temporal Artery Thermometers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Accurate temperature measurement patient present Emergency Department great importance since significant influence treatment patient . At Bispebjerg Hospital temporal artery thermometer implement provide fast comfortable temperature measurement compare rectal thermometer , consider gold standard , define Danish Center Clinical Guidelines . The scientific proof accuracy compare rectal thermometer adult patient insufficient though . The purpose study determine difference temperature measure temporal artery thermometer ( Exergen TAT-5000 ) rectal thermometer ( OMRON MC-341-E ) patient present Emergency Department Copenhagen University Hospital : Bispebjerg . The investigator hypothesize average difference least 0,3 degree centigrade two type measurement ( Bland-Altman ) . Based significance 5 % power 80 % number patient calculate 385 , include estimate 10 % dropout .</detailed_description>
