	<brief_summary>Weakness wall blood vessel locate behind knee ( popliteal artery ) lead swell blood vessel ( aneurysm ) one common type arterial aneurysm . It associate significant risk blood clot formation , narrow blood vessel create serious threat individual 's health . Currently , approve treatment option condition include open surgical endovascular stent-graft repair . In open repair procedure , blood vessel behind knee tie remove small artery create use vein leg . This also call bypass procedure . In endovascular repair , use X-rays , doctor place stent blood vessel . Stent small device similar thin tube . When place right location , doctor open . When stent open , support weaken blood vessel blood go . The weakened artery shrink around stent . The OVER-PAR short name study . Many hospital United States agree participate study . Patients randomize undergo either open endovascular repair treat either procedure . Investigators use short name OPAR open surgical repair EPAR endovascular repair . People aneurysm large 2 cm ( inch ) participate study . The purpose study compare outcomes two standard procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open Versus Endovascular Repair Popliteal Artery Aneurysm Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current therapy patient asymptomatic PAA , elective repair recommend PAA &gt; 2 cm small aneurysm associate mural thrombus1 . Treatment modality similar exclude aneurysm circulation . Current treatment option include open surgical bypass ( OPAR ) aneurysm exclusion endovascular popliteal artery repair ( EPAR ) PAA exclude stent graft . Open repair PAA show excellent graft patency limb salvage rate , however associate need general regional anesthesia , 10-20 % surgical site infection rate , complication seroma , hematoma , neurological injury . Endovascular popliteal aneurysm repair minimally invasive technique perform conscious sedation may associate high risk graft thrombosis , stent fracture , may lower long term success rate . A paucity strong comparative data increase equipoise . An adequately power , prospective , comparative study contrast OPAR approach EPAR guide vascular specialist treatment PAA much need . Trial Conduct The trial conduct compliance protocol , Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) guideline , Declaration Helsinki applicable federal regulatory requirement [ Title 21 Code Federal Regulations Parts 50 , 54 , 56 , 812 45CFR46 ] . This trial register NIH clinical trial registry . Description Importance Population Studied One hundred forty eight subject age 35 old asymptomatic ≥ 2.0 cm PAA undergo repair randomize undergo either OPAR EPAR . These patient recruit participate VSGNE center agree enroll randomize patient trial . This trial formally approve respective Institutional Review Boards . Investigators focus population subject candidate open surgery endovascular therapy determine treat investigator . Such individual represent patient fall `` grey area treatment equipoise '' . Investigators exclude subject associate acute limb ischemia hyper-coagulable state . In OPAR group choice conduit discretion surgeon . Vein non-autogenous conduit allow . In EPAR group , femoral cu-down introduction stent permissible . Percutaneous placement stent-grafts also allow . Investigators exclude individual deem prohibitive risk open vascular surgery standard American Heart Association AHA criterion note formal preoperative evaluation significant non-dialysis dependent renal dysfunction ( Cr . &gt; 3.0 ) . From anatomic standpoint , investigator exclude patient PAA treat stent-grafts due short `` proximal distal landing zone '' . Subjects without patent outflow target vessel , likewise , exclude , treatment option patient usually limit medical management , amputation experimental therapy . TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE The OVER-PAR Trial multicenter randomize trial best open surgical ( OPAR ) best endovascular ( EPAR ) revascularization target population subject asymptomatic ≥ 2.0 cm popliteal artery aneurysm candidate open endovascular treatment . The trial superiority design follow specific aim hypothesis : Trial Design The OVER-PAR Trial prospective , randomize , open label ( two-arm ) , multicenter , superiority trial compare effectiveness open surgical bypass ( OPAR ) endovascular popliteal artery stent graft repair ( EPAR ) 148 patient ( n=74 group ) asymptomatic , clinically significant PAA . Patients asymptomatic PAA screen . These patient enrol VSGNE center agree participate trial . The propose trial duration 4 year . The estimated mean follow-up per subject 2.5 year . The trial power 80 % detect hazard ratio 1.53 , depend crossover rate , assume 2 % loss follow-up . The Randomization Scheme The randomization scheme set Boston Medical Center . Participating sites access telephone . It important emphasize procedure patient randomize acceptable modality care treat PAA . Within cohort , subject randomized 1:1 ratio one 2 treatment arm study coordinator center . Randomization follow follow scheme . For center , seal , opaque envelope indicate either OPAR EPAR repair place container block 6 . Each block 6 envelope contain 3 represent OPAR 3 represent EPAR . When participate site recruit patient , phone call make central study coordinator BMC open envelope container correspond center relay result ( OPAR EPAR ) coordinator request center . Subjects randomize day surgery since procedure require pre-operative planning . For example , patient undergoes open repair need pre-operative vein map access suitability vein conduit . Similarly , patient await EPAR require procurement appropriately size patient-tailored stent -graft repair PAA . Since randomization perform pre-operative period , patient aware surgical plan ( open vs. endovascular ) prior date surgery . He option withdraw study choose appropriate treatment modality , choose . Additionally , surgeon , base judgment , decide offer patient different treatment modality assign randomization scheme subject become screening failure . Data subject categorize screening failure record usual registry arm VSGNE use post-hoc analysis study completion . Each subject follow minimum 24 month follow randomization . Follow-up continue accrual period therefore early enrol survive subject maximum 48 month follow-up . Since randomization perform pre-operative period , patient consult surgical plan ( open vs. endovascular ) prior date surgery . He option withdraw study choose appropriate treatment modality , choose . Additionally , surgeon , base bias , decide offer patient different treatment modality assign randomization scheme subject become screening failure . Subject Withdrawal Criteria Subjects may withdraw study follow reason : - Subject decline study participation . - In investigator 's judgment , subject 's best interest . All protocol-specified visit follow-up procedure perform every subject enrol trial . If subject refuse continue study visit , every attempt make continue contact telephone , write communication , record review determine outcome event occur , unless subject specifically refuse follow-up . The reason withdrawal document subject withdrawn study . If withdraw subject unwilling his/her medical record review end trial period ( document vital status cause death ) , he/she must submit write refusal . TREATMENTS TO BE ADMINISTERED Subjects randomize OVER-PAR endovascular therapy receive treatment accord establish standard care exclusion PAA commercially available endovascular sten-graft . Subjects receive endovascular stent-graft ( ) treat accord Instructions Use implant device ( ) . Medications/Treatments Permitted Not Permitted Trial There medication dispense specifically trial . Investigators follow standard care guideline well adhere Contraindications , Warnings , Precautions publish instruction use commercially available endovascular stent . ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY Specification Efficacy Parameters All-cause mortality report occur time randomization . Perioperative death subset occur 30 day index procedure . Amputation ankle index ( treat ) leg standard definition , report surgical note . Re-interventions review primary endpoint ( new bypass graft , jump/interposition graft revision , thrombectomy/ thrombolysis ) . All re-interventions ( hospitalization ) record , length stay ( LOS ) discharge diagnosis ( cod ) procedure perform cost-effectiveness analysis . Functional Status assess use SF-12 widely use cardiovascular trial available Spanish , French , use North American trial . Quality Life assess use VascuQoL questionnaire7 These standard , validated instrument , available Spanish Canadian French well English , trial STATISTICS Analysis Primary Endpoints The first phase analysis include description study variable . This step include generate summary statistic study characteristic . Summary statistic generate assessed total sample size . The quartile median time-to-event outcome ( e.g . MALE-free survival , MALE-POD ) estimate use Kaplan-Meier method report two-sided 95 % confidence interval intervention arm . The primary efficacy analysis estimation hazard ratio compare time MALE death rate subject receive OPAR receive EPAR treatment use nonparametric log-rank test . The hazard ratio 95 % confidence interval estimate Cox regression model time MALE+all death dependent variable intervention independent variable . The primary analysis conduct intention-to-treat basis ( i.e . base randomization status ) , include subject randomize , last subject follow 1-year study . Analysis Secondary Outcomes Other time-to-event outcome , amputation-free survival , describe secondary aim analyze similarly primary analysis . The analysis also run per-protocol population ( i.e . base actual intervention receive ) .</detailed_description>
