	<brief_title>Combined Chemoembolization Systemic Hyperthermia Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Most patient Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) diagnose intermediate advanced stage tumor become unresectable . Transcatheter arterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) show effective prolongation survival patient unresectable HCC generally adopt standard palliative treatment option patient intermediate stage HCC . However , therapeutic effect TACE term objective tumor response variable modest ( 27 % -40 % ) , indicate actually much room improvement treatment . In many case , patient intrahepatic HCC uncontrolled TACE treatment may suitable treatment option physical condition . For patient , repeat TACE combine adjuvant systemic hyperthermia may offer chance disease control .</detailed_description>
