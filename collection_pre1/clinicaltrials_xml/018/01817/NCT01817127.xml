	<brief_title>Elucidation Breast Milk Composition Structure Over First Year Lactation : UC Davis Lactation Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study 's objective include : 1 ) develop well understand composition structure breast milk early stage lactation specific emphasis glycans lipids ; 2 ) glycan diversity relate maternal infant gut microbiota emphasis bifidobacteria specie ; 3 ) milk composition structure relate maternal health diet . These sample analyze use comprehensive gas liquid chromatographic method , nuclear magnetic resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy mass spectrometry ( MS ) ; next generation sequencing , terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism quantitative polymerase chain reaction . There several cohort main study . Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Cohort . The aim study investigate difference milk composition , infant maternal gut microbiota woman without gestational diabetes mellitus type 2 diabetes vs. control . Fresh Milk Study . The aim study elucidate relationship expression glycan metabolizing gene mammary epithelial cell level milk glycans . RNA Study . The aim study compare RNA milk fat globule membrane crescent human milk epithelial expression profile non-human primate milk . Skin Study . The aim study provide skin sample healthy term infant act control group different study preterm infant . Breast Milk , Gut Microbiome , Immunity ( BMMI ) Project . The aim study provide healthy control sample BMMI project . The BMMI project multi-investigative project design elucidate maternal nutrient status , milk composition structure influence infant gut microbiome participant develop country .</detailed_description>
