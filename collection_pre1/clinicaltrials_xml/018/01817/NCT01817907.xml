	<brief_summary>In Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) , upper airway close sleep . This lead disrupt sleep ( wake night ) , daytime sleepiness , increase risk develop high blood pressure . Currently , best treatment obstructive sleep apnea sleep mask continuously blow air nose ( i.e . Continuous positive airway pressure [ CPAP ] treatment ) . While CPAP treatment stop upper airway close people , many people difficulty sleep mask place therefore use CPAP treatment . This research study conduct learn whether use sedative improve OSA severity alter trait responsible disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) characterize repetitive collapse 'obstruction ' pharyngeal airway sleep . These obstruction result repetitive hypopneas/apneas intermittent hypoxia/hypercapnia , well surge sympathetic activity . Such process disturb normal sleep impair neurocognitive function , often result excessive daytime sleepiness decrease quality life . Furthermore , OSA associate cardiovascular morbidity mortality , make OSA major health concern . Current evidence suggest OSA pathogenesis involve interaction least four physiological trait comprise : 1 ) pharyngeal anatomy propensity towards collapse . This collapsibility upper airway measure critical closing pressure PCRIT . 2 ) ability upper airway dilator muscle activate reopen airway sleep ( i.e . neuromuscular compensation ) measure increase upper airway electromyography ( EMG ) activity baseline level . 3 ) arousal threshold sleep ( i.e . propensity hypopneas/apneas lead arousal fragmented sleep ) measure epiglottic pressure occur time arousal 4 ) stability ventilatory feedback loop ( i.e . loop gain ) . Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) common treatment OSA often poorly tolerate ; ~50 % patient diagnose OSA continue therapy beyond 3 month . Given limitation , alternative approach test generally focus use oral appliance upper airway surgery . In addition alternative therapy , use pharmacological agent treatment OSA gain widespread interest . Previous data show non-myorelaxant hypnotic trazodone increase arousal threshold however effect sleep apnea severity remain unclear . Based study show increase arousal threshold different hypnotic improves sleep apnea severity , hypothesize trazodone increase arousal threshold associate improvement sleep apnea severity . Therefore overall aim study examine effect trazodone OSA severity . STUDY DESIGN : A double-blinded randomized control design use . Initially , participant randomize trazodone placebo arm clinical polysomnography ( PSG ) addition epiglottic pressure cathether . The purpose clinical PSG determine severity OSA ( i.e . AHI ) epiglottic catheter allow calculation arousal threshold complete . During trazodone arm , participant give trazodone ( 100mg mouth ) take bed . During placebo arm , subject give placebo take bed . Participants least 1-week washout period cross next arm study whereby clinical PSG repeat . In total subject study 2 night .</detailed_description>
