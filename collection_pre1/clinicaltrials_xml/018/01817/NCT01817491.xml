	<brief_title>Low Fat Vegan Diet American Heart Association Diet Impact Cardiovascular Risk Obese Hypercholesterolemic 9-18 y.o .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scientific Question : In obese , hypercholesterolemic ( &gt; 169 mg/dl ) 9-18 year old one parent biomarkers inflammation , oxidative stress cardiovascular risk significantly reduce randomize 4 week trial reduce fat , vegan diet , American Heart Association ( AHA ) diet ( also encourage fruit , vegetable whole grain , permit low fat meat dairy , fish ) ? Rationale : `` Cardiovascular disease remain leading cause death North Americans , manifest disease childhood adolescence rare . By contrast , risk factor risk behavior accelerate development atherosclerosis begin childhood , increase evidence risk reduction delay progression toward clinical disease '' . Myeloperoxidase early biomarker inflammation , oxidative stress cardiovascular risk prepubertal obese child express child hypercholesterolemia . Trimethylamine N-oxide , global arginine bioavailability ratio , arginine methylation index , paraoxonase 1 gene , F2-isoprostane also associate future major adverse cardiovascular event . Studies suggest low-fat , vegan diet effective promote weight loss , lower body mass index , improve lipoprotein profile , insulin sensitivity prevent cardiovascular disease overweight individual . Vegetarian diet show prevent also reverse heart disease adult . Dietary habit ( e.g . vegan/vegetarian versus omnivore/carnivore ) associate significant alteration intestinal microbiota composition function . The diet-microbe interaction may play significant role cardiovascular protective effect vegan/vegetarian diet . One small report 15 adult reduce fat , vegan `` Engine 2 Diet '' four week report decrease mean total cholesterol 197 mg/dl 135 mg/dl mean LDL cholesterol fall 124 mg/dl 74 mg/dl . Innovation : This first randomize trial compare low fat vegan diet standard AHA diet . If one diet prove superior brief pilot study , future large long term study need clearly define health implication result . Methods : Obese hypercholesterolemic child age 9-18 identified review medical record recruit initially letter . Child , parent/guardian pair randomly assign either reduced fat vegan diet AHA diet . During 4-week study , participant ask attend group teach cook session week Saturday learn assign diet . The participant also request record diet history 2 weekday 1 weekend day 4 week study .</detailed_description>
