	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether infliximab favourably safely discontinue patient Crohn 's disease sustain complete clinical , biochemical , endoscopic remission infliximab . Further examine clinical utility measure levels/activity infliximab activity anti-infliximab Ab patient sustain complete remission , order investigate whether pharmacoimmunological data predict clinical outcome rationalize therapeutic management patient respect continuation discontinuation infliximab therapy .

	<brief_title>Discontinuation Infliximab Therapy Patients With Crohn 's Disease During Sustained Complete Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent guideline management Crohn 's disease conclude currently available data insufficient make firm recommendation stop TNF-α antibody ( TNF-α Ab ) treatment obtain clinical remission . Further , term `` remission '' well uniformly define may incorporate one feature clinical remission , assess CDAI , biochemical remission , endoscopical remission etc . The recently publish prospective STORI study 115 patient luminal Crohn 's disease report 56 % patient Crohn 's disease discontinue infliximab ( IFX ) clinical remission , maintain remission one year discontinuation therapy . Predictors relapse include certain clinical feature well objective biochemical endoscopical marker disease activity . Consistent data , recently report 61 % patient Crohn 's disease , discontinue IFX complete clinical , steroid free IFX induce remission , maintain remission one year ; half patient still remission nearly two year ( median 680 day [ 412-948 ] ) . A prospective randomized study patient Crohn 's disease necessary confirm extend limit finding , ass whether IFX safely discontinue select subgroup patient complete clinical , biochemical , endoscopical remission . Methods : Study design : Prospective , double-blinded , randomize , placebo-controlled , Danish multi-center study estimate seven Danish participate center . Patients treat physician blind type intervention . Study population : Patients luminal Crohn 's disease sustain complete remission IFX . Study treatment : Patients randomize either continue IFX treatment unchanged dosage frequency , alternatively receive match placebo . All patient grade disease activity ( Crohn 's Disease Activity Index ( CDAI ) , biochemical parameter , endoscopy , and/or MRI ) . Following screen inclusion patient see four week , every eight week . Endpoints assess 48 week . Investigators , explorative analysis , examine clinical utility measure IFX level antibody IFX patient complete remission , order investigate whether pharmacoimmunological data predict clinical outcome rationalize therapeutic management patient respect continuation discontinuation IFX therapy . Additional , investigator investigate optimal time-point three measure activity . Patients day infusion three blood sample draw : one infusion ( trough ) , one right infusion ( obtain arm ) ( peak ) one hour infusion ( C1 ) . Samples measure common solid - fluid phase assay purpose , e.g . Reporter Gene Assay ( RGA ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Luminal Crohn 's disease define accord standardize diagnostic criterion . Age ≥ 18 year . IFX induction treatment week 0 , 2 , 6 follow maintenance therapy . IFX treatment length minimum 12 month . Episodic therapy IFX pause &gt; 12 week accept within last year . The treatment interval last three month 610 week . Complete remission define : CDAI score &lt; 150 Biochemical remission , No sign disease activity evaluate endoscopic examination magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Stable remission , judge treat physician , two consecutive treatment visit correspond 2 schedule IFX infusion . Thus , first visit IFX maintain therapy ( screen visit ) . The second visit time inclusion correspond time next schedule IFX infusion ( i.e . ≈ 8 week ) . No use oral steroid within 3 month prior inclusion . Concomitant therapy immune suppressant , except steroid , allow . The dosage frequency must stable three month prior inclusion must remain stable throughout study period . Initial indication IFX predominantly fistulizing perianal disease . Any contraindication continue IFX treatment , include prior acute delay infusion reaction TNF inhibiting agent , active infection require parenteral oral antibiotic treatment , know infection tuberculosis , human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) hepatitis virus . Any condition include physician find incompatible participation study patient unwilling unable follow protocol requirement .</criteria>
