Participants convenience sample recruit contact local public health department community nurse recruit fly research study coordinator ( UK study personnel ) . Interview session schedule advance take approximately 30 minute . Part II INSPIRE intervention development evaluate small clinic-based pilot study use pre-test/post-test intervention design plan ( Part III ) trial . For pilot testing , investigator pilot vaccination vignette health department ( clinical ) set eligible parent adolescent . Eligible parent come non-acute care appointment ask research nurse enroll research study . The Investigator administer pretest survey , expose participant ( parent ) vignette condition use iPad clinic , post-test survey measure intention receive appropriate adolescent vaccine child well perceived message effectiveness ( vignette ) .

The Investigator perform pilot study one Kentucky River Area District health department clinic 30 parent . This method use pilot past intervention , expect allow u correct problem either design survey assessment intervention . If need , investigator tweak intervention re-pilot use procedure randomize controlled trial . This pilot test also provide advantage assure u intervention procedure translate clinic setting . The Investigator experience translation 1-2-3 Pap video intervention investigator begin social setting ( recruit people school community event ) move clinic setting dissemination . Part III INSPIRE project evaluate site-based group randomize control trial design , individual-level randomization also occur within intervention group . Community vaccination clinic health education site ( staffed local health department contract personnel project nurse ) intervention control condition match percentage free/reduced school lunch relevant demographic . At end Year 1 , one health site pair randomize enhanced video educational intervention ( video vignette + standard care social marketing vaccine event ) standard care vaccination campaign ( standard care health department vaccine event ) comparison group .
