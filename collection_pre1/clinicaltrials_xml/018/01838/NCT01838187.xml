	<brief_summary>Currently know effective treatment patient advanced stage neuroblastoma , pheochromocytoma , paraganglioma relapse responded standard therapy . In previous study use 131I-MIBG potential anti-cancer therapy , decrease size tumor see child adult . This research study continue evaluate side effect 131I-MIBG treat child adult neuroblastoma , pheochromocytoma , paraganglioma . The 131I-MIBG compound intend work selectively deliver radioactive iodine tumor cell , intend result destruction . The purpose research study : - Make 131I-MIBG therapy available patient advance neuroblastoma , pheochromocytoma , paraganglioma - Further assess side effect 131I-MIBG therapy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Expanded Access Protocol Using 131I-MIBG Therapy Refractory Neuroblastoma , Pheochromocytoma , Paraganglioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuroblastoma , pheochromocytoma , paraganglioma remain fatal disease large percentage patient , especially high-risk disease feature become resistant conventional therapy . 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine ( 131I-MIBG ) norepinephrine analog concentrate adrenergic tissue show sensitive specific detect localized metastatic neuroblastoma , pheochromocytoma , paraganglioma . More importantly , experience many institution prove agent use target radiotherapeutic significant anti-tumor activity refractory neuroblastoma 1-7 well pheochromocytoma paraganglioma . Children 's Hospital Philadelphia , UCSF , University Michigan complete large Phase 2 study 131I-MIBG give dos 10-18 mCi/kg stem cell rescue , necessary , show agent safe effective palliative therapy refractory relapse neuroblastoma patient . In addition , grow evidence low-dose ( 5-10 mCi/kg ) submyeloablative MIBG therapy safe effective disease palliation . This protocol therefore provide mechanism deliver therapy clinically indicate . Primary Objectives : - Provide palliative therapy 131I-MIBG patient advanced neuroblastoma , pheochromocytoma , paraganglioma . - Gain information acute late toxicity 131I-MIBG therapy patient refractory neuroblastoma , pheochromocytoma , paraganglioma .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis : Refractory/Relapsed neuroblastoma original diagnosis base tumor histopathology elevate urine catecholamine typical tumor cell bone marrow , OR pheochromocytoma paraganglioma amenable curative surgery Age ≥ 12 month able cooperate radiation safety restriction therapy period with/without pharmacologic anxiolysis . Disease status : Failure respond standard therapy ( usually combination chemotherapy with/without radiation surgery ) development progressive disease time ( new lesion increase size &gt; 25 % preexist lesion ) . Disease evaluation must complete within 8 week study entry . If possible , disease evaluation take place subsequent intervening therapy ; intervene therapy occur , evaluation do clinically indicate . If patient receive prior treatment MIBG , must response stable disease recent MIBG infusion . Patient may PD show initial response MIBG therapy ( [ around ] day 3563 postMIBG therapy evaluation ) . Patients must hematopoietic stem cell product available reinfusion 131IMIBG treatment dos ≥ 12 mCi/kg . If stem cell available , dose 131IMIBG &lt; 12 mCi/kg . The minimum quantity purge unpurged peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) 1.5 x 10e6 viable CD34+ cells/kg ( recommend 2 x 10e6 viable CD34+ cells/kg ) . The minimum dose bone marrow 1.0 x 10e8 mononuclear cells/kg ( optimum &gt; 2.0 x 10e8 mononuclear cells/kg ) . Prior Therapy : Patients may enter study with/without reinduction therapy recurrent tumor . Patients must fully recover toxic effect prior therapy , meet follow criterion : At least 2 week elapse since antitumor therapy patient must meet hematologic criterion . Threemonths elapse case complete radiation follow field : craniospinal , total abdominal , whole lung , total body irradiation ( spot irradiation skullbased metastasis NOT consider craniospinal radiation purpose study . Cytokine therapy must discontinue minimum 24 hour prior 131IMIBG therapy . Bilirubin ≤ 2x upper limit normal ; AST/ALT ≤ 10x upper limit normal Serum Creatinine ≤ 2x upper limit normal OR 24hr creatinine clearance OR GFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73m2 ( For example , patient would meet criterion GFR &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73m2 serum creatinine ≤ 2x upper limit normal . ) ANC ≥ 750/µL ; Platelets ≥ 50,000/µL without transfusion stem cell available ( ANC ≥ 500 platelet count allow stem cell available ) . Patient must myeloid growth factor least 24 hour . If patient receive prior treatment MIBG , may thrombocytopenic , require 2 platelet transfusion per week maintain count 20,000 . Hemoglobin must ≥ 10 gm/dL ( transfusion allow ) regardless stored stem cell availability . Normal lung function manifest dyspnea rest exercise intolerance , oxygen requirement No clinically significant cardiac dysfunction Signed informed consent/assent : The patient and/or patient 's legally authorized guardian must acknowledge write consent/assent become study subject obtain , accordance institutional policy approve U.S. Department Health Human Services . Patients disease major organ system would compromise ability withstand therapy . Significant organ impairment discuss Principal Investigator prior patient entry . No patient pregnant lactating allow . Patients childbearing potential must practice effective method birth control participate study , avoid possible damage fetus . Abstinence effective method birth control . Patients hemodialysis Proteinuria , absence urinary infection , within 4 week prior plan treatment date relative contraindication receive therapy patient pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma . Patients pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma proteinuria must 24hr urine protein determination . If proteinuria confirm institutional upper limit normal , patient ineligible MIBG therapy . Patients active infection meet grade 34 accord NCI CTCAE v4.0 . Patients know MIBGavid parenchymal brain metastasis eligible . ( Patients leptomeningeal skullbased metastasis eligible . )</criteria>
