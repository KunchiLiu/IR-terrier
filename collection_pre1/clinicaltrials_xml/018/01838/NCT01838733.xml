	<brief_summary>Cerebral desaturations occur frequently patient undergo non-cardiac surgery . The definition constitute cerebral desaturation , incidence phenomenon , association desaturations perioperative outcome , mechanistic explanation cerebral desaturations remain unexamined . This study seek identify true incidence magnitude cerebral desaturations high-risk non-cardiac surgical patient association desaturations perioperative outcome . The investigator attempt determine following ( 1 ) The proper definition , incidence severity decrease cerebral saturation ( rSO2 ) high-risk non-cardiac surgical patient ( 2 ) mechanism surround decrease rSO2 correlate alteration physiologic parameter ( blood pressure , cardiac output , hemoglobin concentration , carbon dioxide level ) ( 3 ) correlate incidence severity decrease rSO2 relevant perioperative . The investigator also analyze panel inflammatory biomarkers determine biomarkers ability predict postoperative complication . The investigator study 200 high-risk patient undergo high-risk non-cardiac surgery . The investigator determine incidence severity decrease rSO2 , associate factor occurrence decrease rSO2 , relationship decrease rSO2 adverse perioperative outcome composite well define perioperative complication death , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident , acute kidney injury , delirium , postoperative infection , need mechanical ventilation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cerebral Oximetry Perioperative Outcome Non-Cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There number study examine link intraoperative decrease rSO2 adverse perioperative outcome3-7 . These study , vast majority set cardiac surgery , suggest decrease rSO2 ( detect near-infrared spectroscopy ) may relate adverse neurologic non-neurologic sequela . Interestingly , importantly , study examine cerebral desaturation non-cardiac surgical patient ( undergo major abdominal surgery , carotid endarterectomy , liver transplantation , pulmonary resection ) also uncovered link cerebral desaturation non-neurologic outcomes3,7-12 . These small study report preliminary correlate decrease rSO2 various postoperative complication prolong length stay . These study also show change rSO2 correlate change traditional hemodynamic parameter ( mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) heart rate ) . All study suffer similar flaw , however . They typically small size , vary definition constitute cerebral desaturation event , incompletely , poorly define complication . Also lack mechanistic explanation cerebral desaturations peripheral oxygen saturation typically remain near normal . As result , two natural question arise relation prior research . First , cerebral desaturations causative adverse outcome ( include non-neurologic complication ) , second desaturations treat ( i.e . cerebral oxygenation normalize ) would outcome improve ( i.e . cerebral desaturations merely epiphenomenon ) ? Numerous study demonstrate poor correlation traditional hemodynamic parameter ( blood pressure heart rate ) cardiac output oxygen delivery13-17 . Historically field anesthesiology critical care , focus monitoring resuscitation target perfusion pressure rather organ flow . Neglecting fact organ require flow well pressure lead over-reliance normal vascular pressure ( arterial , central venous , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ) surrogate adequate organ flow18 . It entirely possible monitoring cerebral oxygenation discover link desaturation non-neurologic outcome may show brain index organ tissue perfusion monitoring . That say , since perfusion major organ typically monitor anesthesia , cerebral oximetry excellent mean monitor global decrease tissue oxygen delivery . Consistent hypothesis , large cerebral oximetry trial date , Murkin colleague discover incidence magnitude cerebral desaturations related major non-neurologic organ morbidity19 . The investigator also collect blood sample preoperatively 24 hour postoperatively determine panel inflammatory biomarkers ability predict postoperative complication . Primary Objective : determine incidence severity cerebral desaturation high-risk patient undergo major vascular abdominal surgery Secondary Objectives : 1 . To determine factor associate occurrence cerebral desaturation 2 . To determine relationship desaturation adverse perioperative outcome 3 . To determine level panel inflammatory biomarkers related cerebral desaturation postoperative complication . Study design : prospective observational study Population : 200 consecutive high-risk patient undergo non-cardiac surgery . High-risk patient define age &gt; 65 undergoing major non-cardiac surgery include abdominal aortic aneurysm repair , major hepatic resection , colonic resection , pancreatoduodenectomy , esophagectomy . Methods : In addition standard CAS monitor , patient undergo pulse contour cardiac output monitor cerebral oxygen saturation monitoring . The anesthetic technique discretion attend anesthesiologist . During procedure , attend anesthesiologist blind rSO2 data . As previous study conduct institution , cardiorespiratory variable ( heart rate , systolic , diastolic mean arterial blood pressure , peripheral cerebral oxygen saturation , end tidal CO2 tension , end tidal anesthetic gas concentration , cardiac index ) sample frequency 60Hz . Data acquire Philips Intellivue速 Monitor ( Philips Healthcare , Andover , MA ) , FloTrac/Vigileo速 minimally invasive CO monitor ( Edwards Lifesciences , Orange County , CA ) , ForeSight速 Cerebral Oximiter ( CasMED , Brantford CT ) process TrendFace Solo速 software ( IExcellence Software , Germany ) . Arterial blood gas sample occur every 20 minute . Other intraoperative variable collect include case duration , blood loss , total narcotic dose , total benzodiazepine dose , use dose vasopressor , use neuraxial local anesthetic . The definition cerebral desaturation differs previously perform study . Some use absolute decrease 55 % , variably define decrease patient 'baseline ' ( either breathe room air 100 % oxygen ) , time specific cerebral saturation threshold , area specific cerebral saturation threshold ( measurement take account duration magnitude desaturation ) 3,5,21,22 . Based intraoperative data collect , The investigator examine currently utilized definition cerebral desaturation construct receiver operate characteristic curve determine parameter high predictive ability link cerebral desaturation perioperative outcome . In consultation Biostatistical Consulting Unit investigator calculate sample size use previously report incidence cerebral desaturation , range 15-26 % accepted margin error 5 % . Based conservative estimate incidence ( 15 % ) , The investigator would need total 195 patient determine incidence cerebral desaturations 5 % margin error ( see figure 1 ) . The investigator include 5 additional patient study due previous experience 1 % rate data loss acquisition rSO2 data ( related technical failure ) . The Lan DeMets alpha spending function utilized determine trial stop early . As secondary outcome , investigator attempt correlate decrease rSO2 composite well define perioperative complication death , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident , acute kidney injury ( define AKIN criterion , table 223 ) , delirium ( define CAM-ICU method , figure 324 ) , postoperative infection , need mechanical ventilation &gt; 24 hour first 28 postoperative day . Based result study investigator able determine , aid multivariate logistical regression analysis calculation odds ratio , definition cerebral desaturation mostly closely link aforementioned outcome measure .</detailed_description>
