	<brief_title>HCV Treatment HIV Co-Infected Patients Asia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It estimate 130-170 million people chronically infect hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) . Out 33 million HIV-infected people around world , estimate least 5 million also infected HCV . HCV therapy Pegylated-interferon ribavirin 50-90 % effective achieve cure , depend virus genotype patient characteristic , ethnicity IL28B polymorphism . Treatment study HIV-uninfected population show Asian patient experience high treatment response rate Caucasians . Unfortunately , although HCV therapy routinely offer resource-rich setting , essentially inaccessible resource-limited setting ( RLS ) , people infect virus live . One bottleneck increase implementation HCV therapy RLS therapy currently expensive deem complex broad implementation RLS . Through project study , TREAT Asia aim build regional approach Asia establish feasibility HCV therapy HIV-infected patient RLS , implement innovative model HCV-HIV care expand future . Patients HIV infection document HCV antibody routine HIV care four study site HCV RNA test . Patients confirm chronic HCV infection HCV genotype IL28B testing , well liver disease assessment Fibroscan® . Patients chronic HCV co-infection genotype meeting treatment eligibility criterion offer treatment pegylated-interferon ribavirin open-label single arm study . A total 200 patient enrol study . Patients receive intensive treatment preparedness counseling , ongoing treatment adherence support . Most patient receive treatment total 48 week , patient HCV genotype 2 3 , moderate liver fibrosis , rapid virological response ( negative HCV RNA four week therapy ) receive 24 week therapy . The primary endpoint interest proportion patient achieve sustained virological response , define undetectable HCV RNA 24 week treatment completion .</detailed_description>
