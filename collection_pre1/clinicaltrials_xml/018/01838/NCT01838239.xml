	<detailed_description>It unclear metabolomic profile individual change response short-term intervention omega-3 fatty acid . It necessary establish mean standard deviation level omega-3 fatty acid relate metabolite healthy subject different disease state order well understand mechanism relate lipid metabolism metabolic disease modify omega-3 fatty acid . Specifically , project examine metabolomic profile healthy control patient immunoglobulin A nephropathy ( IgAN ) omega-3 fatty acid intervention . The IgAN patient sample obtain collaborator previously complete project . The healthy subject test small pilot trial conduct UC Davis describe . - Twelve healthy volunteer willing able take 6 g fish oil 6 week recruit general UC Davis population include student , faculty , staff . The volunteer recruit personal communication seminar school-related activity well flyer post campus . - The volunteer contact scheduled screening consent visit . Subjects met eligibility criterion sign consent form schedule baseline blood draw collect first morning urine sample . A research team member contact subject day first schedule study date confirm remind subject fasting , collect first morning urine void , time location study . - On study visit , participant come Ragle Human Nutrition Center ( 1283 Academic Surge ) 7 9 overnight fast , point weigh ( clothe shoe ) digital scale height measure . A registered phlebotomist draw 20 mL blood venipuncture baseline blood draw . Subjects also bring first morning urine sample time . Subjects give fish oil capsule separate Ziploc bag week intervention . Subjects take fish oil capsule home discretion study personnel suggest take capsule last meal day bed even . Study personnel contact subject throughout course study phone and/or e-mail make sure adverse effect fish oil ensure compliance . Subjects instruct record diet 24-hour dietary recall baseline blood draw , 3 additional time point throughout study . - Immediately blood collection , researcher separate red blood cell peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) plasma , aliquoted sample , store -70Â°C freezer future analysis .</detailed_description>
