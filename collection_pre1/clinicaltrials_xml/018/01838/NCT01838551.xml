	<detailed_description>This single period , open-label , dose titration study ass efficacy , safety , tolerability , PK COR-003 subject CS . The trial design identify minimally effective maximally tolerate dos CS population . Following initial screening period , study conduct 2 treatment phase follow : - Dose titration phase : approximately 2 16 week achieve effective tolerable maximum dose ( therapeutic dose ) - Maintenance phase : 6 month treatment therapeutic dose without prior dose increase follow establishment appropriate dose identify titration phase ; - Extended evaluation phase : 6 month continue treatment maintenance phase ( 6 - 12 month ) ; dose adjustment allow required treatment Efficacy assess measure UFC concentration specify time described clinical protocol . Blood sample PK determination collect time indicated clinical protocol . An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) review safety drug throughout study . The constituent DSMB membership adjudication committee specifically describe clinical protocol . Subjects complete 6-month maintenance phase study remain study additional 6 month extend evaluation . COR-003 provide compassionate use protocol subject wish continue treatment COR-003 .</detailed_description>

Confirmed diagnosis newly diagnose , persistent recurrent CD subject candidate surgery radiotherapy CD define accord criterion Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline diagnosis CD ( Nieman 2008 ) . Previous medical record collect used support diagnosis CD . Specifically , CD define Mean 24hour UFC level ≥1.5X ULN repeat determination Morning plasma corticotropin ( ACTH ) level 5 ng/L ( 1.1 nmol /L ) Either MRI confirmation pituitary macroadenoma , inferior petrosal sinus gradient &gt; 3 corticotropinreleasing hormone ( CRH ) stimulation patient microadenoma , subject prior pituitary surgery , histopathology confirm ACTHstaining adenoma . If inferior petrosal sample perform without CRH , central peripheral prestimulation gradient &gt; 2 required 4 . Confirmed diagnosis newly diagnose , persistent recurrent endogenous CS etiology subject candidate surgery radiotherapy . CS define accord criterion Endocrine Society Clinical Practice Guideline diagnosis CS ( Nieman 2008 ) . Previous medical record collect used support diagnosis , differentiation cause CS , specifically Mean 24hour UFC level ≥1.5X ULN repeat determination Ectopic ACTH secretion , pituitary origin Ectopic CRH secretion Adrenaldependent CS ( adrenal adenoma , adrenal autonomy ) Etiology unknown 5 . Subjects MUST elevate mean 24hour UFC level ≥1.5X ULN assay base minimum four measurement adequately collect urine . Urine may collect sequential day . 6 . In addition elevate mean UFC , presence abnormal value one follow test : Abnormal DST : Elevated 8 AM serum cortisol ≥1.8 ug/dL ( 50 nmol/L ) 1 mg dexamethasone orally 11 PM evening prior ( conduct already diagnostic workup subject within previous 2 month start Screening Phase ; case previous test result detail conduct need available Baseline visit ) Elevated late night salivary cortisol concentration ( least two measurement ) &gt; ULN NOTE : For subject estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR determine Modified Diet Renal Disease MDRD equation ) &gt; 40 &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 addition meeting UFC criterion , late night salivary cortisol test result ( ≥2 measurement ) MUST also demonstrate evidence CS . 7 .
