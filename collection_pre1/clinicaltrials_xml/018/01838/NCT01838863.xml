	<brief_summary>Bleeding avoidable cause death trauma patient . Up one-third severely injured trauma patient find coagulopathic forty percent mortality follow severe injury due uncontrollable hemorrhage set coagulopathy . It establish early administration fresh frozen plasma decrease mortality follow severe injury , replace lose coagulation factor , improve coagulopathy restore blood volume . This study determine give plasma severely injured trauma patient ambulance transport versus arrival hospital help reduce hemorrhage , thus decrease total blood product administration mortality .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Design : Severely injured trauma patient systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) ≤ 70 SBP ≤ 90 heart rate ≥ 108 bpm scene enrol randomized receive either 2 unit frozen plasma thaw field normal saline ( current standard care ) , initial resuscitation fluid . After initial resuscitation fluid , group receive standard care , include pack red blood cell , additional normal saline , plasma need base laboratory clinical evidence coagulopathy . Blood sample clinical information collect throughout hospital stay 28 day injury .</detailed_description>
