	<brief_summary>1 . Using multiparametric MRI Ultrasound-guided MRI-guided biopsy allow accurate sampling tumor therefore increase rate `` progression '' early ( first second ) surveillance biopsy decrease rate `` progression '' late ( third ) surveillance biopsy compare Transrectal Ultrasound-guided biopsy . 2 . Quality life ( QoL ) similar patient undergoing MRI Ultrasound MRI-guided Transrectal Ultrasound-guided biopsy . 3 . Biomarker expression level correlate biopsy progression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Prostate Cancer Patients Undergoing Active Surveillance With Without MRI-Guided Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Favorable risk patient randomize one two active surveillance arm . Stratification base Prostate-specific antigen density ( PSAD ) ( = &lt; 0.15 v &gt; 0.15 ng/mL per mL ) , number positive core diagnostic biopsy ( 1 vs 2 ) : - Arm I : Active Surveillance Alone ( AS ) . TRUS guide biopsy start ( within 6 month enrollment ) yearly interval thereafter 36 month initial biopsy ( maximum four biopsy ) . - Arm II : MRI-Managed Active Surveillance ( MRI-AS ) . MRIus MRI-guided biopsy start ( within 6 month enrollment ) yearly interval thereafter 36 month initial biopsy ( maximum four biopsy ) . Patients also complete Quality Life ( QoL ) assessment provide unique data effect MRI monitoring patient undergo active surveillance QOL . The investigator select group measure use extensively prostate cancer population .</detailed_description>
