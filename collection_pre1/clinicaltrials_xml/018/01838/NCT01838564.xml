	<brief_summary>Over 50 % child die cancer still suffer symptom could effectively alleviate . The purpose Pediatric Quality Life Evaluation Symptoms Technology ( PediQUEST ) Study evaluate whether provide feedback family provider child feel improve child distress quality life ( QoL ) child advance cancer . PediQUEST computerize survey ask child and/or parent child feeling , i.e . whether child physical emotional symptom , well aspects life , school friend , go . After survey complete report summarize patient/parent answer print . When child report moderate high distress symptom email automatically send primary provider ( oncologist , nurse , psycho-social clinician well pain palliative care service ) alert child 's distress . In study evaluate whether use PediQUEST provide print report parent provider reduce distress improve quality life child advance cancer . In addition , want understand whether feasible carry randomize control trial child advance cancer . Finally , data collect , use describe natural history symptom quality life report child . Children enrol study ( parent ) ask complete PediQUEST survey week . A random half child receive feedback intervention , i.e . patient , parent , provider receive printed report ( email child distress ) . The half complete PediQUEST survey receive report . We analyze data collect 20 week follow-up see whether receive PediQUEST report effect child distress quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction : Cancer lead cause nonaccidental death childhood . ( Arias et al . 2003 ) In spite significant scientific progress , one quarter child cancer still survive ( Greenlee et al . 2000 ) , 50 % experience substantial suffering could alleviate . ( Wolfe et al . 2000a ) Pediatric palliative care expect standard care research field establish national priority Institute Medicine ( IOM ) . ( Field et al . 2003 ) Earlier work group suggest parent physician recognize early stage child realistic chance cure , likely integrate element effective palliation child 's care . However , early stage concordance prognosis rare . ( Wolfe et al . 2000b ) Communication delivery optimal care advance stage illness especially challenging child . ( Shelton 1999 ) The anticipation lose child physician ' difficulty ( Saunders 1979-80 ; Hilden et al . 2001 ) may hinder discussion poor prognosis impact decision-making integration palliative care . Thus attention symptom management quality life ( QoL ) child advance cancer may limit . The collection standardize symptom QoL data show enhance physician 's recognition , knowledge accuracy assessment palliation symptom , increase patient-provider discussion QoL issue directly improve patient 's QoL . ( Detmar et al . 2002 ; Taenzer et al . 2000 ; Velikova et al . 2004 ) Whether finding applicable child remain establish . One obstacles routine symptom QoL assessment child need developmentally adapt ( Eiser et al . 2001b ; Eiser et al . 2001c ; Hain 1997 ) parent-proxy tool ( Eiser et al . 2001a ) , make paper pencil format extremely impractical . Computerized survey offer potential solution . Patient acceptance device find high . ( Buxton et al . 1998 ; Velikova et al . 2002 ; Velikova et al . 1999 ; Velikova et al . 2001 ) Our current project -the PediQUEST Study- consist pilot randomize control trial ( RCT ) aim assess effect routinely report symptom QoL data . We use innovative data collection strategy : hand-held computer devise , Pediatric Quality Life Evaluation Symptoms Technology ( PediQUEST ) readily administer user-appropriate survey instrument generates report summarize patient feel . As far aware , first RCT conduct child advance cancer evaluate palliative care intervention . Given challenge research population , propose simultaneously focus several goal . Aims : Aim 1 : ( Feasibility study ) Assess feasibility conduct randomize controlled supportive care trial ( RCT ) child advance cancer . Aim 2 : ( PediQUEST Evaluation ) Preliminarily ass effect routinely feed back QoL symptom data family primary oncologist , alert supportive care team highly distress symptom . Aim 3 : ( Descriptive study ) Prospectively explore determinant child 's suffer parental-physician discordance regard prognosis treatment goal child advance cancer . Design : Aim 1 : Cohort survey study ; Aim 2 : Pilot prospective RCT ; Aim 3 : Cohort study embed RCT . Setting : Three large US pediatric cancer center . Subjects : 104 child 2-years old advanced cancer parent enrol December 2004 June 2009 . Follow-up : Patients initially follow 9 month death whatever occur first . However , interim analysis first 29 patient show 75 % alive nine month , suggest enrollment healthy cohort . We therefore change follow-up period 3 month option multiple re-enrollments end data collection ( December 2009 ) death . Methods : Feasibility study : All subject approach enrollment invite complete one-time paper pencil `` Consent survey '' regardless decision whether participate . All enrolled subject ask complete paper pencil `` Participation survey '' complete study dropping-out order explore determinant attrition . PediQUEST Evaluation Descriptive study : Symptom QOL score track week . Surveys embed PediQUEST system administer tablet computer . Participants ' recruitment : Eligible child identify daily review clinic roster clinic staff include nurse , oncologist and/or nurse practitioner verify patient 's primary oncologist use checklist sent email . If introduce study opportunity ask question , child parent ( ) willing participate , parent ( ) ask review sign inform permission/assent document cover parent ( ) child 's participation . A provider 's completion eligibility checklist indicate inform consent provider . Study Instruments : 1 . PediQUEST survey ( PQ-Survey ) : assess symptom , quality life , overall sickness . Nine survey version develop allow consistent measurement across age range respondent . Self-report start 5 year age ; child age 5 12 year answer short , age-adapted questionnaire complement additional parental questionnaire ; teen answer full self-report questionnaire . Parents child 2 4 year old answer full survey child 's behalf . If child feel well , parent could complete full questionnaire behalf . PQ-Surveys pilot test 15 patient show good acceptability comprehensibility . PQ-surveys use four tool : 1 ) PQ-Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale ( MSAS ) , adapt previously validate child ( Collins et al . 2000 ; Collins et al . 2002 ) proxy ( Drake et al . 2003 ) MSAS , measure frequency , severity distress 24 symptom ; 2 ) Pediatric Quality Life Inventory ( PedsQL ) , 22-item health relate quality life instrument ; ( Seid et al . 1999 ; Varni et al . 2002 ; Varni et al . 2003 ) 3 ) Faces Pain Scale Revised ( face pain scale , use measure current pain intensity ) ; ( Hicks et al . 2001 ) 4 ) Sickness VAS scale ( overall sickness measure create ad hoc ) . 2 . Survey Caring Children Cancer ( SCCC ) : In addition , parent physician perspective regard prognosis treatment goal collect baseline every 3 month use paper-and-pencil survey SCCC , adapt survey bereave parent . ( Wolfe et al . 2000b ) 3 . Post death survey : If patient die within study period parent invite complete post-death survey least four month follow death ass distress last month life retrospective perspective regard overall quality care . 4 . Satisfaction Surveys : Child parent survey adapt exist questionnaire . ( Grogan et al . 1995 ; McCusker 1984 ; Weaver et al . 1993 ) Satisfaction PQ technology assess use seven item child eight year old 11 item parent . Surveys embed PediQUEST system administer fourth eighth PediQUEST administration . A survey evaluate participant 's satisfaction PediQUEST intervention ( see ) administer concurrently ( eight item ( parent ) , five item ( child eight year old ) ) intervention participant . Provider satisfaction PQ intervention , perceive usefulness PQ-system assess online survey administer end data collection . Intervention : Patients randomly allocate receive routine feedback symptom QOL . The feedback intervention two component : ( ) PQ-reports : print report make available provider ( inserted chart visit ) family ( hand immediately survey completion clinic ward ) . PQ-reports consist bar plot PedsQL MSAS symptom score current four prior administration , summary highlighting change since last report , list available resource symptom control ( family ) , generic pain management recommendation ( provider ) . Training interpret PQ-reports offer family enrollment annual basis provider ; ( ii ) PQ email : automatically generate PQ-MSAS individual symptom score ≥70 , two consecutive administration patient parent report score ≥70 frequency , severity distress item , PedsQL total score ≤ 40 . E-mails sent primary provider ( oncologist , nurse , psychosocial clinician ) , local palliative care service , , pain report , pain service ( equivalent ) . No instruction impart respond email . Families providers patient control arm study receive feedback report . The allocation process embed PediQUEST blind investigator patient complete first survey . Because nature intervention open label study . As token appreciation , small non-monetary incentive provide child , parent , provider . Outcomes : This study explore feasibility conduct RCT assess supportive care intervention child advance cancer ( aim 1 ) . It also provide estimate consent attrition rate , determinant , burden associate repeat measurement . In addition , pilot study preliminarily assess impact feedback child 's distress quality life . Main outcomes efficacy study ( aim 2 ) present . This pilot study render sufficient data accurate sample size calculation future study serve explore determinant suffer child advanced cancer ( aim 3 ) . Statistical Analysis : PediQUEST Evaluation ( Aim 2 ) : To assess effect PediQUEST , proportion patient unrelieved symptom arm compare use odds ratio associate chi-square test . To assess progression report level child 's distress QOL trend , run mixed effect model assumes linear trend outcome 20 week follow subject . The model examine difference average trend time ( slope ) intervention control group include fix effect term represent interaction treatment status time since study entry . Lack difference slope coefficient support null hypothesis effect intervention . Single point secondary outcome analyze compare arm test Wilcoxon rank-sum test continuous outcome odds ratio associate chi-square test proportion . Sample Size Power Calculations A formal sample size estimation possible give lack data distribution score advance cancer population variation time . For reason originally propose recruit 120 patient parent , sample size driven practical rather statistical consideration would serve basis future sample size calculation . We estimate 60 subject per arm would allow adequate balance arm likely provide sufficient power detect large clinical effect single point measurement .</detailed_description>
