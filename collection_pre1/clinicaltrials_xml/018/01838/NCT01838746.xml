	<detailed_description>Age , without doubt , one important risk factor adverse event cardiovascular procedure incorporate major risk score method . There abundant literature deal outcome elderly patient undergo cardiovascular procedure operative risk significantly increase preoperative risk assessment great importance decision-making process fragile patient ( 1 ) . In elderly patient percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) attractive treatment method , particularly multiple comorbidities ( 2 ) . On hand , coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) show durable procedure also among octogenarian ( 2 ) . Young patient require myocardial revascularization generally consider low operative risk , data immediate late outcome scarce . However , decision-making process young patient complicate potentially aggressive nature premature coronary artery disease likely long expectancy life , expose significantly high risk recurrent coronary event well need repeat revascularization . CABG seem durable compare percutaneous coronary intervention ( 3 ) , particularly excellent late result use arterial graft ( 4 ) . Therefore , young patient diffuse coronary artery diffuse may likely benefit surgical revascularization . However , formal comparative analysis two treatment method previously perform young patient population . Since CABG major procedure potential risk operative mortality major morbidity , argument surgical revascularization , even recent pool data show perform exceedingly low mortality risk ( 0.9 % ) ( Biancari et al . submit , Fig . 1 ) . Such low postoperative mortality rate similar report Khawaja et al . ( 5 ) patient age ≤ 50 year treat PCI ( 0.86 % ) . However , PCI perform 41 % patient single vessel coronary artery disease . This likely significantly differ surgical series ( 6 ) . Only two study evaluate outcome CABG patient age &lt; 40 year ( 7 ) &lt; 50 year ( 8 ) estimate survival rate 10 year 75 % . A study Ellis ( 9 ) address survival PCI 86 patient age &lt; 40 year show 10-year survival rate 91 % , significant number patient underwent repeat PCI ( 37 % ) and/or CABG ( 22 % ) . These finding view light fact patient diffuse coronary artery disease ( 3-vessel disease present 11 % patient ) treat two decade ago . Khawaja et al . ( 6 ) report 2922 patient age ≤ 50 year underwent percutaneous coronary intervention since 1979 5-year survival 95 % . They report repeat target revascularization rate range 19 % 27 % accord different study period . The lack data long-term outcome well operative detail ( particular , use arterial graft ) peri- postoperative medication prevent conclusive result durability either CABG PCI young patient . Furthermore , recent advance stent technology well peri- postoperative medical treatment indicate need comparative study define baseline characteristic patient age &lt; 50 year undergo either PCI CABG evaluate current immediate late outcome .</detailed_description>
