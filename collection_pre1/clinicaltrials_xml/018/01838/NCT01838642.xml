	<brief_summary>Background : - Medullary thyroid cancer ( MTC ) represent 5 % thyroid cancer present hereditary ( 25 % case ) sporadic ( 75 % case ) neuroendocrine malignancy . - MTC arise parafollicular C-cells thyroid . - Germline mutation rearrange transfection ( RET ) proto-oncogene occur virtually hereditary MTC case , somatic RET mutation occur 50 % sporadic case . - Drugs target RET kinase vandetanib cabozantinib show efficacy treatment advance metastatic MTC , however , effective RET inhibitor need previously untreated patient well patient become refractory molecular target therapeutic ( MTTs ) . - Ponatinib , drug Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve therapy chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( Ph+ ALL ) , potent inhibitor RET kinase . Primary Objective : -To determine objective overall response rate ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) ponatinib treatment patient advance metastatic MTC previously treat cabozantinib vandetanib : 1 ) tumor RET mutation 2 ) tumor without RET mutation . Eligibility : - Patients must histologically confirm , unresectable , locally advanced metastatic MTC , measurable disease RECIST criterion . - Patients must disease amenable biopsy willing undergo biopsy molecular analysis , also adequate archival material thyroidectomy tumor biopsy obtain prior begin systemic therapy . - Patients must fail intolerant prior treatment cabozantinib vandetanib . - The last dose prior systemic therapy must 28 day prior first dose ponatinib - Radiation therapy permit last treatment receive 28 day prior first dose ponatinib . Design : - Open label phase II trial 2 treatment group : - RET mutation positive MTC , previously treat vandetanib cabozantinib - RET mutation negative MTC , previously treat vandetanib cabozantinib - Patients receive ponatinib 30 mg orally daily disease progression development intolerable side effect . - Tumor response assess RECIST 1.1 criterion 8 week every 12 week thereafter . After one year study , tumor response assess every 16 week . - Patients biopsy MTC molecular analysis prior initiate treatment ponatinib .
