	<detailed_description>Background : The detection coronary artery disease ( CAD ) one important task medicine . Exercise-induced myocardial ischemia pathophysiological hallmark stable CAD . Currently , sophisticate image technique include coronary angiography , rest/stress myocardial perfusion single-photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) , coronary CT-scanning require accurately detect CAD . Unfortunately , technique associate inherent risk due substantial radiation exposure , intraarterial intravenous application iodinate contrast medium , mechanical complication , require referral specialist , costly . In addition , provide anatomical functional information . For clinical practice , functional information differentiates lesion cause exercise-induced myocardial ischemia functionally irrelevant lesion critical . Exercise electrocardiography ( ECG ) widely use simple non-invasive functional test , however imperfect sensitivity specificity ( 75 % ) detection CAD . Novel cardiac biomarkers well novel computer-based quantitative approach analyse ECG signal record exercise offer advance information technology signal processing may provide incremental value exercise ECG thereby improve clinical care . Aim : The primary aim perform large study worldwide evaluate novel biochemical electrocardiographic signature alone well combination standard 12-lead exercise ECG detection exercise-induced myocardial ischemia ( diagnostic endpoint ) . The secondary aim evaluate innovative tool risk prediction occurrence cardiovascular death acute myocardial infarction long-term follow-up . Methodology : We enroll 4000 consecutive patient suspect exercise induce myocardial ischemia refer rest/ergometry myocardial perfusion SPECT . SPECT finding ( complement coronary angiography finding patient obtain investigation ) use adjudicate quantify presence myocardial ischemia ( primary diagnostic end point ) . Clinical long-term follow-up obtain 360 day 5 year record death , cardiovascular death , acute myocardial infarction . Investigational test : Venous blood sample collect exercise stress test determination biochemical signature possibly associate myocardial ischemia include high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I , high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T , B-type natriuretic peptide , IL-6 , cardiac microRNA . In addition , continuous ECG signal record use 12 lead ( 16 lead subset patient ) 24-bit amplitude resolution 8000 Hz sample frequency , stress test . Novel method computer-based ECG signal-processing technology use decipher electronic marker myocardial ischemia develop improve software algorithm automate ECG interpretation . All investigational test perform blinded fashion . Potential Significance : We hypothesize biochemical electrocardiographic signal myocardial ischemia significantly improve non-invasive detection exercise-induced myocardial ischemia . This would markedly improve initiation treatment affect patient thus advance medical management patient suspect CAD . In addition , approach would help simplify ( exercise ECG versus myocardial SPECT ) non-invasive detection exercise-induced myocardial ischemia help avoid inherent health hazard associate current radiologic imaging procedure .</detailed_description>
