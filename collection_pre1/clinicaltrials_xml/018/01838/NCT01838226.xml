	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular ( CV ) event prevention ( e.g. , myocardial infarction , cerebrovascular accident ) remain single important public health problem United States , cardiovascular disease lead cause death among VA user . Improving provision prevention service primary focus Secretary 's New Models Care Transformational Initiative . However , prevention challenge achieve . Multifactorial behavioral intervention effective treat number chronic illness ( e.g. , hypertension , diabetes ) , less know ability reduce risk among patient without unify chronic illness . Group visit efficient , effective strategy deliver multifactorial behavior change intervention ; VA commit group visit strategy address wide array primary care problem . Groups show effective mean improve number outcome number individual disease , , , role cardiovascular prevention among patient without single common illness unknown . Coaching type multi-factorial behavioral intervention involve goal-setting , work overcome barrier behavior change . Coaching perform one-on-one , coach intervention deliver group setting . The investigator show , 150-subject RCT , group coach plus individualized telephone coaching reduces cardiovascular risk , population study different typical VA user . The investigator propose three-site , two-arm randomize trial measure effectiveness group prevention coaching ( GPC ) intervention improve cardiovascular risk , compare VA usual care . The study perform Durham , Buffalo , Syracuse VAMCs . Each arm 200 patient ; patient VA user without prior history cardiovascular event , least 5 % risk event , either inadequately controlled hypertension dyslipidemia , current smoking . The GPC intervention focus change behavior patient 's choice likely lead improvement cholesterol , blood pressure , smoke cessation . Behaviors reinforce include limited healthy eating , decrease caloric intake , increase physical activity , stress reduction , participatory decision making physician . Barriers behavior identify . The coach adopt problem-solving approach overcome barrier reinforce behavior ; problem-solving well-described framework behavior change . The GPC coach/interventionist either facility 's Health Behavior Coordinator ( HBC ) person hire research enterprise train credentialed identically HBC . All outcome obtain baseline , 6 , 12 month enrollment blind research personnel . The primary outcome change 10-year risk fatal coronary event non-fatal MI 6 month enrollment , measure Framingham Risk Score . Key secondary outcome include dietary content Food Frequency Questionnaire , physical activity measure International Physical Activity Questionnaire , weight . The investigator also determine group cohesion , measure Group Dynamics Inventory , influence effectiveness GPC . The investigator well also assess whether time spend contact coach influence effectiveness , database log-in timekeeping strategy .</detailed_description>
