	<brief_summary>Rapid response team system implement numerous hospital throughout world goal improve identification safety hospitalize patient clinically deteriorate . Despite theoretical benefit , rapid response system proven medical literature ultimately change outcome . The traditional physical exam helpful evaluate treat unstable medical patient types event significant limitation decease sensitivity specificity finding . Ultrasound known tool accurately assess patient shock respiratory failure ICU highly train operator investigator knowledge study set rapid response event hospital ward critical care fellow focus training . The investigator aim assess impact ultrasound perform critical care fellows rapid response event .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Ultrasound Guide Management During Rapid Response Event</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize controlled trial determine portable critical care ultrasound use feasible , finding change clinical decision make critical care fellows whether ultrasound improve patient outcomes rapid response event Beth Israel Medical Center . Patients rapid response call cardiac respiratory failure randomize either bedside ultrasound perform critical care fellow time rapid response undergo bedside ultrasound clinically indicate specifically request RRT leader . For patient rapid response call shock respiratory failure randomize intervention group , designate ultrasound critical care fellow document rank top 2 preliminary cause either shock respiratory failure data collection instrument ( DCI ) . These clinical ( i.e . pre-ultrasound ) diagnose base history , physical exam ancillary testing available prior ultrasound performance . Available ancillary testing document . An ultrasound exam perform designate ultrasound fellow use portable hand-carried unit ( GE Vscan ) finding document DCI . The GE Vscan use ultrasound perform study . The ultrasound study take approximately 5 -10 minute interfere alternative evaluation treatment modality deem necessary rapid response . The critical care ultrasound fellow provide RRT leader team 2 likely post ultrasound diagnosis shock respiratory failure document DCI . Any change management make result ultrasound exam , include new ancillary test therapeutic intervention record . At 72 hour follow initial event ICU general medical attend physician ask document `` final '' diagnosis cause initial shock respiratory failure . This `` final '' diagnosis serve `` gold standard '' allow assessment accuracy pre-ultrasound post-ultrasound diagnosis . Patients randomized standard care group ultrasound perform time rapid response unless deem medically necessary respond RRT leader critical care fellow . This current practice approach investigator hospital ultrasound perform clinically indicate . The study investigator obtain DCI 's well final diagnosis attend physician 72 hour , enter data database contain unique patient identifier . The patient 's time respiratory failure time shock record primary outcome measure . Secondary outcome in-hospital mortality , utilization CT scan chest x-ray 24 hour follow rapid response hospital length stay also record . Also measure variability pre post-ultrasound diagnosis well change management follow ultrasound performance .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients rapid response call : 1 . Hemodynamic instability define : Systolic blood pressure le 90 mmHg less 40 mmHg previously establish baseline Heart rate great 130 beat per minute Known elevate lactate normal value . 2 . Hypercapnic hypoxemic respiratory failure judge respond critical care fellow . Patients rapid response call : 1 . Are hemodynamically unstable respiratory failure . 2 . Are hemodynamically unstable obvious source bleed explain hemodynamic instability .</criteria>
