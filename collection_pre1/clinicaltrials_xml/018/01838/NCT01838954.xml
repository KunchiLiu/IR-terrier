	<brief_summary>Due constant strain joint hand frequently affect osteoarthritis ( OA ) . Short-wave diathermy ( SWD ) form electromagnetic therapy , cause movement ion , distortion molecule , creation eddy current result heat produce deep tissue . Its claimed mechanism action include induce anti-inflammatory response , reduce joint stiffness , stimulate connective tissue repair , reduce muscle spasm pain . Since available study perform study large weight-bearing joint , lack scientific evidence efficacy SWD hand OA . The aim randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled study evaluate effect SWD : joint function patient hand OA . joint pain patient hand OA . grip strength patient hand OA . quality live patient hand OA .</brief_summary>
