	<brief_summary>The PBD rare group inherit disorder due failure form functional cellular peroxisomes . Most patient progressive hear visual loss , lead deafness blindness , well neurological deterioration . There therapies disorder . A misfolded protein residual function , PEX1-Gly843Asp , represent one third mutant allele . Using patient cell line mutation , report recovery peroxisome function treatment Betaine , act nonspecific chemical chaperone misfolded PEX1 protein . Betaine , trimethylglycine , Health Canada FDA approve orphan drug treatment homocystinuria use u safely regularly genetic medicine . We perform 6 month pilot study 12 patient test hypothesis Betaine , recommend dos , recover peroxisome biochemical function blood .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Peroxisome biogenesis disorder ( PBD ) group inherit condition cause faulty assembly peroxisomes , structure locate inside cell regulate level important fat lipids body . When faulty peroxisome assembly , PBD , important fat lipids either accumulate make . There specific treatment disorder , management supportive . In order complement exist supportive therapy , physician researcher still actively look new treatment act root cause PBD : peroxisome function . To identify drug help recover peroxisome function group scientist develop laboratory-based research test aim review activity large number potential treatment . Using test , uncovered Betaine improve function peroxisome , defect cause PEX1-Gly843Asp mutation , may improve overall health child suffer PBD . Betaine medication already available powder oral solution , another rare disease . It approve many country , include Health Canada Canada Food Drug Administration USA . Paediatric genetic physician use prescribe medication know well . At current stage scientific knowledge , critical next step evaluate benefit betaine child PBD due PEX1-Gly843Asp mutation , ensure medication safe measure level improvement function peroxisome . Thus , principal objective study determine improvement key peroxisome function ( plasma long chain fatty acid profile red cell plasmalogen level , plasma pipecolic acid level plasma bile acid profile ) . Another objective measure growth child / development .</detailed_description>
