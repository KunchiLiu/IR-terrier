	<brief_summary>This clinical effectiveness trial design compare effectiveness , safety , tolerability treatment tapentadol prolong release oxycodone/naloxone prolong release non-opioid pre-treated subject severe chronic low back pain neuropathic pain component . Both tapentadol opioid oxycodone effective chronic severe pain tapentadol oxycodone/naloxone show advantage gastrointestinal tolerability versus oxycodone . Therefore , high scientific interest compare latter 2 analgesic respect gastrointestinal tolerability . Tapentadol may advantage regard neuropathic pain-related symptom low back pain due 2 mechanisms action .</brief_summary>
