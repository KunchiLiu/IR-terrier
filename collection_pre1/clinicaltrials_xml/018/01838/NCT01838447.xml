	<brief_title>Prevention Vitamin D Deficiency Following Pediatric CHD Surgery : Phase II Dose Evaluation Randomized Controlled Trial Comparing Usual Care With High Dose Pre-operative Supplementation Regimen Based Institute Medicine Daily Upper Tolerable Intake Level</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 - INTRODUCTION 1.1 Summary problem CHD common condition estimate prevalence 1 per 100 general population . A significant proportion pediatric patient require one corrective surgery lifetime , lead 15000 procedure per year North America . Post-operatively , patient suffer significant morbidity may include pronounced systemic inflammatory response , coagulopathy , respiratory failure , electrolyte disturbance , arrhythmia , myocardial dysfunction , kidney failure , infection endocrine imbalance . Interventions prevent modulate post-operative pathophysiology may prevent illness , speed recovery decrease chronic morbidity high risk pediatric population . Vitamin D recognize pleiotropic hormone important functioning multiple organ system , include central critical illness pathophysiology . Recent research group others document 4 every 5 CHD patient inadequate blood level vitamin D follow surgery , association immediate post-operative hormone level clinical course . Altogether , finding similar result adult critical care cardiac surgery population , suggest optimization vitamin D status follow CHD repair could lessen inflammation , reduce nosocomial infection improve cardiac function . As inexpensive medication ( ~ $ 15/month ) generally regard safe , vitamin D potential ideal intervention improve outcome follow CHD repair . Clinical trial require determine whether elevation pre-operative 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25OHD ) prevention post-operative vitamin D deficiency improve health patient CHD require cardiac surgery . 1.2 - Gaps current knowledge regard vitamin D supplementation CHD The current body knowledge suggest optimization vitamin D status prior follow CHD repair could improve outcome reduce inflammation , few nosocomial infection improve cardiac function . However , finding translate clinical practice number unknown must address : 1 . Evidence benefit interventional study - As unique under-appreciated problem , interventional study establish prevention post-operative vitamin D deficiency improve clinical outcome CHD patient . 2 . Lack study evaluate vitamin D dose CHD population - Attempts perform large randomize control trial ( RCT ) would premature dose regimen prevents post-operative vitamin D deficiency yet identify . Moreover , vitamin D dose study guideline develop specific CHD population ; presently child CHD receive advice regard supplementation healthy child . 3 . The safety vitamin D dose usual care study CHD population - Although tempt extrapolate recent safety data high dose vitamin D study healthy child CHD population , may inappropriate . CHD patient unique metabolic demand , organ dysfunction , know unknown genetic abnormality potentially make less susceptible vitamin D. To begin address knowledge gap complete pilot dose evaluation trial goal identify supplementation regimen safely prevent post-operative vitamin D deficiency . 2 - OBJECTIVES AND HYPOTHESIS 2.1 Hypothesis Pre-operative supplementation daily high dose vitamin D regimen , model Institute Medicine ( IOM ) daily upper tolerable intake level ( UL ) , significantly reduce vitamin D deficiency follow CHD surgery , compare usual intake . 2.2 Study objective Primary study objective : In pediatric patient CHD , determine whether pre-operative regimen daily high dose vitamin D result significant reduction post-operative vitamin D deficiency , compare usual care Secondary study objective : 1 . Determine whether pre-operative regimen daily high dose vitamin D , compare usual care , result vitamin D related adverse event ( hypercalcemia , hypercalciuria ) . 2 . Determine whether pre-operative regimen daily high dose vitamin D , compare usual care , improve establish marker vitamin D axis functioning ( active hormone level , cardiac function ) . 3 . Determine barrier feasibility RCT evaluate whether vitamin D supplementation improve clinical outcome child require CHD surgery . 3 - METHODOLOGY 3.1 Study design rationale - We perform pilot double blind randomize control dose evaluation trial compare efficacy safety two vitamin D dosing regimen prevention post-operative vitamin D deficiency child undergo surgery CHD . 3.2 Proposed supplement dos ( Interventions ) test rationale - Treatment group - The dos evaluation model two age specific intake level recommend IOM . Infants 6 month age high dose group receive 600 IU/day IOM recommend UL , 6 12 month receive 100 IU/day UL . Usual care group receive Adequate Intake ( AI ) infant Recommended Dietary Allowance ( RDA ) child 1 year . These dos choose IOM achieve blood 25OHD level 50 nmol/L majority healthy population . High dose group base age-specific UL . These dos choose elevate 25OHD well 50 nmol/L , minimize risk vitamin D toxicity ( e.g . hypercalcemia , hypercalciuria ) . 3.3 Anticipated pre- post-operative 25OHD level study arm - Given 40 % intra-operative decline , pre-operative level 90 nmol/L required maintain post-operative level 50 nmol/L ( value sufficient substrate synthesize active metabolite available ) . The ability certain vitamin D intake level achieve pre-operative value infer recently complete dosing study healthy child level . These study , include one co-investigator ( Dr. Hope Weiler , McGill ) show usual care dose 2 3 month achieve pre-operative level 90 nmol/L 40-50 % . In contrast , study evaluate dos approximate high daily intake level ( 1600 IU/day ) achieve mean 25OHD level 130 150 nmol/L ; suggest 80 % CHD patient could achieve pre-operative level 90 nmol/L . 3.4 Study design detail 3.4.2 Stratification : We anticipate two month daily consumption may require achieve target 25OHD level . Participants stratify whether expect receive least 8 week study drug prior surgery . This stratification guarantee equal number CHD patient receive 8 week oral dose end high low dose arm . We stratify age ( 1 year age ) 3.4.3 Randomization allocation concealment : Computer software generate randomization perform . Given expected recruitment ( 4 5 per month ) potential impact season 25OHD randomization perform block ( 4 within stratum ) . Only pharmacy staff aware patient receive high low dose . 3.4.4 Blinding : We blind patient , family , investigator , hospital staff , research personnel treatment arm . The two intervention indistinguishable ( vial , volume , color , taste , consistency smell ) . Only pharmacist know identity study drug administer specific patient . Blinding broken request clinical service . 3.4.5 Co-interventions : The study protocol protocolize co-interventions study single centre CHEO protocols standardized approach common post-operative complication adverse event . 3.5 Study procedure 3.5.1 Recruitment : Potentially eligible study participant identify ambulatory clinic ( cardiology , cardiovascular ) inpatient ward ( include pediatric intensive care neonatal intensive care unit ) . CHD patient identify require surgery refer cardiovascular team consultation may provide patient brochure directly hospital staff part standard information package ( mailed outpatient ) . Caregivers ( child appropriate ) ask permission approach study participation research nurse/assistant . 3.5.2 Study drug distribution : Europharm agree provide study drug require concentration , prepare indistinguishable vial blind purpose . Pharmacy administer study drug ( base randomization , participant age whether patient breast formula feed ) . Infants CHD assign usual care arm give placebo ( 0 IU/mL ) receive usual ( recommend ) vitamin D intake part formula . 3.5.3 Frequency duration follow-up appointment Planned additional study appointments- There additional appointment plan study purpose . Patients may require additional appointment research test identify clinically relevant finding . Planned additional study phone call - Research study staff call caregiver participant ( applicable ) every two four week encourage compliance provide education . 3.5.4 Frequency biological sample collection metabolite measure Before initiation study drug - Urine - After consent obtain study participant wait pharmacy prepare study drug gather urine sample determination calcium : creatinine ratio . Where developmentally appropriate participant ask provide urine container . Urine bag place young child . Blood - Neonates study participant ( mainly inpatient ) require surgery within 2 month diagnosis enrollment blood collect prior ( within 2 day ) start study supplement determination 25OHD . These patient blood collect research purpose take operating room . During period study drug administration - Blood - For study participant receive study drug 6 month measure 25OHD calcium time clinically indicate blood-work regularly schedule cardiology cardiovascular surgery ( CVS ) clinic appointment At time standard pre-surgical blood work - All outpatient participant blood collect time standard pre-surgical blood work preparation operation ( two three week prior surgery ) . The blood send CHEO laboratory measurement 25OHD ionized calcium . Once complete , result forward safety officer study investigator ( seal ) . Intraoperative biological sample measurements- Blood - All study participant 2 mL blood collect operating room follow anesthesia intubation , prior skin incision initiation cardiopulmonary bypass . Blood also send CHEO laboratory pre-operative ionized calcium determination . Remaining sample aliquoted stored -80 degree Celsius ( oC ) . Urine - All study participant urine collect insertion urinary catheter . The sample send CHEO laboratory determination calcium : creatinine ratio . Study result appear patient hospital chart , label study identification ( ID ) number forward study investigator safety officer review . Post-operative biological sample study measurement Blood - All study participant 2 mL blood collect follow separation cardiopulmonary bypass ( admission PICU ) . Further study participant 2 mL blood collect post-operative day 1 , 3 , 5 10 PICU . Samples collect arterial central venous catheter time clinically indicate blood work . If catheter remove , blood collect time clinically indicated venipuncture . If patient discharge ward day 10 research sample collect discharge sample collect time discharge research blood gather . Urine - All study participant urine collect urinary catheter first post-operative day . The sample send CHEO laboratory determination calcium creatine concentration . Echocardiography - A comprehensive exam perform immediately post-operatively ( standard care ) first post-operative day train technician pediatric cardiologist . Case report form 1 . Questionnaire - On day surgery research coordinator collect participant dairy unused study supplement . Information also collect prescribed medication , nutrition , additional supplement use . 2 . Operative detail - The research assistant extract detail operative information , include : cardiac lesion type , surgery perform , Risk Adjusted Congenital Heart Surgery ( RACHS ) score , total fluid intake output , blood product fluid administration loss , hypothermia , need deep hypothermic circulatory arrest ( duration ) , aortic cross clamp time , cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) circuit volume , CPB circuit constituent , CPB time , occurrence intraoperative hyper hypocalcemia , administration parenteral calcium , need catecholamine follow separation CPB , occurrence intra-operative arrhythmia . 3 . PICU course - Clinically relevant information clinical course organ dysfunction collect , include : death , extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) , PRISM illness severity , cardiovascular dysfunction ( fluid bolus requirement , inotrope/catecholamine use , arrhythmia ) , renal dysfunction ( urine output , creatinine measurement , need dialysis ) , hypocalcemia calcium administration , duration mechanical ventilation duration PICU stay . 3.5.5 Other metabolite measurement research specimens Remaining research blood use research purpose ( measurement antimicrobial peptide , cytokine , nutritional marker ) . 4 -STUDY SAFETY MEASURES 4.1 Background vitamin D safety toxicity Acute vitamin D toxicity characterize hypercalcemia hypercalciuria , classic symptom directly attributable abnormality . Acute toxicity rare event occur context overdose ( accidental prescribed megadoses range 300,000-600,000 IU ) . The risk acute vitamin D toxicity study remote would require consumption one vial study drug meet dos ( ~150,000 IU ) blood 25OHD level know cause toxicity . Vitamin D toxicity due genetic susceptibility - Concern safety daily high dose vitamin D supplementation date back 1950 's rise idiopathic infantile hypercalcemia ( IIH ) coincide implementation higher daily vitamin D intake ( ~4000 IU/day ) . This small epidemic lead decrease recommend daily vitamin D intake level could prevent rickets hypocalcemic seizure ( 400 IU/day ) . It think case IIH due rare genetic condition ( 1:10000 ) increase susceptibility vitamin D. Of , patient William 's syndrome CHD part constellation symptom propose project exclude individual . Lack subacute/chronic toxicity IOM high dose healthy child - Given recent suggestion higher vitamin D level might protect non-bone disease , safety vitamin D dose usual care ( 400-600 IU/day ) reconsider . To address question American Canadian government IOM assemble committee expert provide recommendation base upon comprehensive review literature . In final IOM report age specific daily upper tolerable intake level provide intend safely elevate 25OHD level avoid toxicity . Recently two blind RCTs show vitamin D supplementation slightly IOM daily upper tolerable intake level cause hypercalcemia hypercalcuria . It important acknowledge IOM recommendation healthy child may applicable child CHD 4.2 Safety measure clinically relevant research finding Pre-surgical 25OHD ionized calcium level - To avoid vitamin D overdose , hypercalcemia side effect select supplement level recently proven safe healthy child target period high dose supplementation 6 month , 12 month . Further , avoid excessive vitamin D level time surgery measure 25OHD ionized calcium pre-surgical blood work ( ~3 week prior surgery outpatient receive many month supplementation ) . These value determine CHEO laboratory result forward study investigator safety officer . Study participant elevate blood calcium and/or vitamin D level identify contact safety officer . Ionized calcium threshold establish . For 25OHD , although 500 nmol/L generally consider definitive toxicity threshold , choose intervene 25OHD level 200 nmol/L value supraphysiological exceeds study goal . The follow detail action take abnormal value : 1 . For 25OHD 200 nmol/L evidence hypercalcemia ( vitamin D toxicity ) : discontinue study drug immediately , repeat value ( fast ) , refer endocrinology . 2 . For 25OHD 200 nmol/L without hypercalcemia : study drug reduce 50 % ( c ) For 25OHD 250 nmol/L , without hypercalcemia : study drug discontinue ( ) For hypercalcemia 25OHD 200 nmol/L : repeat bloodwork ( fast ) refer endocrinology Pre-surgical 25OHD ionized calcium level period study drug administration . For patient receive 6 month study drug prior surgery determine blood 25OHD ionized calcium time routine bloodwork CVS cardiology appointment ( hospitalization ) Post-operative blood calcium level . Will determine multiple time follow cardiac surgery represent standard care . Both hypo hypercalcemia manage clinical team require . Study participant persistently elevate blood calcium level ( two day , explain intravenous calcium administration ) refer endocrinology . Post-treatment , pre-operative elevated urine calcium : creatinine ratio - As prolonged exposure hypercalciuria ( &gt; 3 month ) could theoretically cause nephrocalcinosis ultrasound perform prior hospital discharge patient elevate immediate pre-operative urine calcium creatinine ratio . Any study participant nephrocalcinosis refer CHEO nephrology service assessment . It important note exception decrease vitamin D dose minimal daily intake ( occur default patient ) would additional treatment nephrocalcinosis time . Dr. Geier offer see patient expense . Post-operative elevated urine calcium : creatinine ratio - Urine calcium creatinine ratio measure part standard medical care . Further research available indicate impact CHD operative procedure acute post-surgical calcium excretion long-term nephrocalcinosis risk . However , patient population follow closely nephrocalcinosis rarely report follow CHD surgery ( one case series 3 literature ) appear patient significant risk nephrocalcinosis . However , addition high dos vitamin D could predispose nephrocalcinosis give concurrent acute illness , immobilization diuretic use . Therefore patient elevate calcium : creatinine ratio ( collect first post-operative day ) refer nephrology service . Again , Dr. Geier offer consult patient ; repeat calcium : creatinine ratio decide upon investigation . Participants study drug discontinue decrease retain study , peri-operative biological sample collect outlined , include analysis use intention treat methodology . 4.3 Study result unclear clinical relevance 4.3.1 Post-operative vitamin D Low risk elevate post-operative vitamin D - As described , vitamin D level check 2 3 week prior surgery . For patient even moderate elevation 25OHD ( 200 nmol/L ) study drug intake modify ensure vitamin D level exceed 250 nmol/L individual time surgery . Given pre-operative safety measure know 40 % intraoperative drop , anticipate study participant vitamin D level 250 nmol/L post-operatively . Even participant unexpectedly high 25OHD value , treatment would initiate without evidence hypercalcemia ( note - patient persistent post-operative hypercalcemia would refer endocrinology outline section 4.1 ) . Further , management plan post-operative patient 25OHD excess 200 nmol/L would discontinue high dose study supplement . As study participant discontinue study drug time surgery , patient elevate 25OHD already receive appropriate management . Unclear relevance low post-operative Vitamin D - Observational study suggest low post-operative vitamin D contribute protracted clinical course . However , presently unclear whether acutely increase 25OHD post-operative CHD patient intravenous form safety single enteral megadoses vitamin D ( &gt; 100,000 IU ) proven diseased pediatric population . With exception participant endocrinology consults initiate ( hypercalcemia ) patient encourage continue standard vitamin D supplementation follow surgery ( infant 400 IU , child 600 IU ) . This intake gradually restore 25OHD 50 nmol/L 2 3 month period . Given rationale would benefit determine 25OHD value time active patient care . For reason , immediate pre post-operative blood collect store -80 oC batch determination vitamin D metabolite . 4.3.2 Elevated urine calcium : creatinine Background - There theoretical increase risk hypercalciuria lead nephrocalcinosis high dose vitamin D supplementation . Although frequently discuss literature association vitamin D supplementation nephrocalcinosis appear limited two rare circumstance : rare genetic disorder call vitamin D resistant rickets cumulative vitamin D intake 600,000 ( day month ) . Pre-treatment urine calcium/creatinine ratio - Given absence good evidence support link low moderate dose daily enteral vitamin D intake hypercalciuria nephrocalcinosis decide exclude patient study base pre-treatment urine calcium creatinine ratio . The pretreatment value report two treatment group use determine whether CHD patient high initial value likely elevate calcium : creatinine ratio time surgery and/or evidence nephrocalcinosis . This finding would result exclusion patient subsequent multicenter phase III study . 4.4 Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) A DSMB set trial . Study result analyze half participant ( n=32 ) complete study procedure , include assay 25OHD , ionize calcium urine calcium : creatinine ratio . With biochemistry information clinical adverse event DSMB determine whether safe continue pilot study . 5 - ETHICAL REVIEW AND CONSIDERATIONS The propose trial review Research Ethics Board Children 's Hospital Eastern Ontario . Informed consent obtain parent patient ( assent , applicable ) . All participation entirely voluntary parents/children inform free refuse participate withdraw consent time course study without jeopardize excellence care receive cardiovascular surgery program CHEO . All information keep confidential , accessible study personnel treat team , release third party . 6 - SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION Primary objective - Based observational study find recent dose evaluation study healthy child estimate 40 % usual care arm post-operative 25OHD level 50 nmol/L . Based 25OHD level achieve 1600 IU/day recent study approximate IOM high dose healthy child anticipate 80 % high dose arm post-operative level 50 nmol/L . Therefore group sample size 28 treatment arm require achieve 80 % power detect difference group proportion 0.40 . The test statistic use two-sided Fisher 's exact test significance level test target 0.05 . Assuming 10 % drop rate , 62 patient ( total ) recruit . Comments power evaluate vitamin D relate adverse outcome - ( 1 ) Hypercalcemia - Our observational study ( n=58 ) identify case pre-operative immediate post-operative hypercalcemia . With baseline rate usual care arm 0 10 % sample size would sufficient show statistically significant difference group rate high dose arm exceed 30 % . ( 2 ) Hypercalciuria - Information baseline rate hypercalciuria prior follow cardiac surgery usual care vitamin D intake available . The propose sample size would sufficient demonstrate 35 % difference proportion baseline pre post-operative rate 0 20 % . 7 - STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The analysis study perform use Statistical Analysis System ( SAS ) software ( Copyright SAS Institute Inc. , Cary , North Carolina , USA ) p-value le 0.05 consider statistically significant . Descriptive statistic - Treatment group describe compare use : ( ) mean standard deviation medians inter-quartile range value continuous variable ( ii ) frequency percentages categorical variable . Statistically significant difference determine use Chi-square Fisher 's exact test categorical variable , t-tests nonparametric test ( e.g . Wilcoxon ) continuous variable , appropriate . Primary outcome - The primary analytical approach evaluate randomized patient intention treat analysis . Differences primary outcome measure , proportion 25OHD &lt; 50 nmol/L , treatment group evaluate use Fisher 's exact test . Logistic regression analysis use important variable unevenly distribute group . *We anticipate minimal miss data 95 % participant recently complete observational study immediate post-operative sample . Secondary outcome - Secondary analysis evaluate group base data type . Outcome measure continuous evaluate use t-test , Wilcoxon sign rank test ( appropriate ) linear regression analysis important variable evenly distribute group . Binary secondary outcome measure ( e.g . hypercalcemia , hypercalciuria ) compare two treatment group use Fisher 's exact Chi-square . For analysis outcome measure represent time event ( e.g . restoration active hormone ( 1,25OH2D ) level normal range , time extubation , PICU length stay ) apply log rank test . If randomization lead equal distribution important variable ( e.g . weight ) analysis expand multiple regression modeling . Subgroup analysis - The well know pharmacology enteral vitamin D dosing show least 2 month regular daily intake require build body store achieve steady state blood level vitamin D. Consequentially neonates infant enrol study require surgery within two month birth CHD diagnosis analyze separately . Primary objective - Similar outpatient study primary objective subgroup report proportion ( usual care high dose group ) vitamin D deficient post-operatively . However , give participant receive study drug short period anticipate proportion 25OHD level 50 nmol/L remain low high dose group . Our program goal stage identify dose regimen prevent post-operative vitamin D deficiency 75 % CHD patient . Given goal , estimate prevalence 15 35 % would need 12 neonate per group generate confidence interval exclude 75 % . As neonate represent 20 % CHD surgery , anticipate enrol 62 total subject sufficient . Feasibility - Most neonate CHD require cardiac surgery within first week life serious cardiac lesion limit enteral nutrition medication delivery . Anticipating patient significantly elevate 25OHD level daily enteral intake IOM high dose study provide important information willingness health care provider provide enteral study drug . This information allow u consider alternative dose regimen future study base single divide represent one month worth daily dosing ( e.g . 5-10,000 IU/kg ) . 8 - STUDY TEAM AND MANAGEMENT The principal investigator ( DM ) co-investigator ( KM ) responsible supervision study .
