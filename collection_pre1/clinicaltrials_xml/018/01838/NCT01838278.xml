	<brief_title>Effectiveness Vojta Therapy Motor Development Preterm Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Premature child constitute heterogeneous group regard gestational age , determinant cause premature birth , illnesses occur neonatal period socio-economic status family . These constraint could cause increase risk development group child , well motor abnormality , compare population infant bear full term . Cerebral Palsy ( CP ) , example , common neurological disorder group child . So many study show association CP prematurity . They point probability premature infant CP eight time higher compare full-term infant . Apart CP minor motor abnormality also present range consequence preterm child . Therefore , increase consider child bear prematurely survive , account development neonatal care , frequency appearance motor sequel describe remain constant , crucial importance social , economic health aspect implement strategy improve outcomes child . In regard , development physiotherapy treatment aim preterm infant essential prevention intervention point view . At Region Murcia/Spain , one child bear preterm direct Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) , already establish protocol immediate referral among hospital early intervention service , interdisciplinary team develop individualized comprehensive intervention plan accord characteristic condition child , motor point view , physiotherapist team one determine appropriate action take . According Vojta , basic motor function human develop course first year life , process name Postural Motor Ontogenesis . The practice Vojta Therapy ( VT ) prove effective treatment neuromuscular disturbs . Finally , another research emphasize importance follow premature child , due problem capable cause motor disability might detectable first moment life , therefore longitudinal follow-up recommend . Regarding matter , general aim study compare efficiency VT child motor development oppose physiotherapy intervention method use premature infant without neurological damage , throughout first 18 month life , take group full term infant reference . In order , use longitudinal research design , refer four different age-groups child follow first trimester life 18 month , correct age premature infant chronologically full term infant . - METHODS : This longitudinal research design four assessment follow first trimester ( 1 ) , 6 , 12 18 month . The child divide three group . An experimental group premature child treat Vojta Therapy control group premature child treat traditional physiotherapy method another control group ( Group 3 ) full term infant present risk pathology . - Instrument : In order measure motor development , child experimental group control group A B evaluate Bayley-II scale , particular Psychomotor Scale . The Bayley Scales Infant Toddler Development ( BSID-II ) set standardize rating scale , enable u assess mental , psychomotor behavioral development child 1 42 month - Samples : The experimental group compose preterm child ( &lt; 37 week gestational age ) , present psychomotor delay , diagnose neurological damage receive VT method physiotherapy treatment , well programme early intervention include sensory-motor stimulation . This group consist boys girl treat Early Intervention Centre Lorca Aguilas/ Murcia , Spain . The control group A consist premature child similar base characteristic experimental group one receive VT another method physiotherapy treatment within global programme early intervention include sensory-motor stimulation . These child treat monitor Early Intervention Service Board Education Region Murcia ( Spain ) . The control group B form full term infant , without illness risk . Seventy two boy girl figure group . All child treat monitored Prevention , Promotion Early Childhood Development Early Intervention Service University Murcia ( Spain ) . All parent must sign consent form authorize participation child project . - Interventions : Children experimental group Vojta group , receive two weekly session sensory-motor stimulation two weekly session Vojta Physiotherapy . Sensory motor stimulation Vojta physiotherapy session last 50 minute . A guidance programme also give parent carry home promote overall development child teach necessary Vojta Method exercise , perform four time day 20 minute . Children control group A Non-Vojta group , receive two weekly session sensory-motor stimulation two weekly session physiotherapy different methodology Vojta . Duration session experimental group , 50 minute . A guidance programme also give parent carry home promote overall development child recommendation provide regard postural motor skill every child need ensure proper handling home . Children control group B full term infant group receive intervention type parent give pointer promote development home . Interventions regard sensory-motor stimulation Early Intervention Centre guideline full term child carry psychologist specialist Early Intervention . Vojta Physiotherapy intervention perform expert physiotherapist train method Vojta Association International . ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS All data analyze use computerized statistical package SPSS 15.0 Windows . In order verify objective , efficiency Vojta Method motor development preterm child first 18 month life compare physiotherapy method use full term infant group reference , mixed 2-factor ANOVA ( 3x4 ) inter-subject factor ( type sample ) three level ( Vojta , Non-Vojta Full Term ) one intra-subject factor repeat assessment ( motor development ) 4 measurement time ( first trimester , 6 , 12 18 month ) use .</detailed_description>
