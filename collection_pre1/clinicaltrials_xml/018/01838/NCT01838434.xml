	<brief_summary>This Phase I/II trial study safety effectiveness lenalidomide without idelalisib . Biological therapy , lenalidomide , may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Idelalisib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth .

	<brief_title>Lenalidomide With Without Idelalisib Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A notice temporary accrual suspension Alliance A051201 issue 1/28/14 . The study suspend new patient accrual protocol amendment finalize , provide revise treatment instruction . The study reactivate 4/22/14 include removal rituximab treatment arm . Outline : This phase I , dose-escalation study follow phase II study . The phase I treatment plan include follow : 1 . Lenalidomide test sequential dose level standard 3+3 design . 1 . Dose Level 0 = 15mg/day day 1-21 every 28 day 2 . Dose Level 1 = 20mg/day day 1-21 every 28 day 3 . Dose Level 2 = 25mg/day day 1-21 every 28 day . Patients continue lenalidomide 48 week ( 12 cycle ) treatment . 2 . Idelalisib orally administer start 150 mg twice daily continuous 28-day cycle progression , intolerance , patient/physician discretion . The dose dose level 0 , 1 , 2 . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm Phase II treatment plan . The primary secondary objective study : 1 . Phase I Primary Objective : To determine safety tolerability combination lenalidomide idelalisib sequential dose cohort . 2 . Phase II Primary Objective : To determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) combination lenalidomide without idelalisib randomize phase II design . 3 . Phase II Secondary Objectives : 1 . To determine overall response rate ( ORR ) , complete response rate ( CR ) , overall survival ( OS ) combination lenalidomide without idelalisib randomize phase II design . 2 . To determine prognostic and/or predictive significance proliferation marker cell cycle component patient relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) treat idelalisib lenalidomide . 3 . To determine whether phosphorylated protein kinase B ( pAKT ) expression level correlate response idelalisib plus lenalidomide . 4 . To determine whether Notch activation assess notch homolog 1 , translocation- association ( NOTCH1 ) intracellular domain ( ICD ) immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) correlate NOTCH1 mutational status outcome MCL patient treat idelalisib lenalidomide . 5 . To determine whether sex determine region Y-box 11 ( SOX11 ) expression correlate response patient relapsed/refractory MCL treat idelalisib lenalidomide . 6 . To correlate cereblon ( CRBN ) expression response patient relapsed/refractory MCL treat idelalisib lenalidomide . 7 . To evaluate several plasma cytokine correlate observe change objective response rate .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Documentation Disease : 1 . Histologically documented mantle cell lymphoma , follow immunophenotypic characteristic : cluster differentiation ( CD ) 5+ , ( CD ) 23 , cyclin D1+ ; may initial diagnostic biopsy , one obtain time relapse 2 . Institutional flow cytometry immunohistochemistry must confirm CD5 antigen expression , lack CD23 antigen expression , expression cyclin D1 . 3 . Variant case mantle cell lymphoma eligible participate discussion joint agreement PI , Pathology Committee Chair , Lymphoma Committee Chair . Variant case may include ( limited ) lack Cyclin D1 expression ( ie case Cyclin D2 Cyclin D3 expression ) , CD23 negativity ( criterion meet ) , alternative translocation lead Cyclin D1 expression . 2 .
