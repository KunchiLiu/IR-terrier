	<brief_summary>The general objective project examine impact Wobenzym PS supplementation blood marker inflammation inflammation gene expression volunteer sub-clinical inflammation . The study undertaken accord double-blind , cross , randomize , placebo control design . The study involve men woman subclinical inflammation ( n=24 ) . Eligible subject blood CRP &gt; 1 mg/L &lt; 10 mg/L good health . The impact Wobenzym PS inflammation ( vs. placebo ) assess compare blood fast concentration whole blood gene expression anti- pro-inflammatory protein 4-week supplementation ( Wobenzym placebo ) . The two 4-week supplementation separate 4-week wash period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Wobenzym PS Inflammation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Inflammation increasingly recognize key etiological factor development atherosclerosis subsequent cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . This pro-atherogenic state strongly correlate often find co-segregating among individual obesity metabolic syndrome . There increase evidence support use clinical practice novel marker atherosclerosis CVD risk . C-reactive protein ( CRP ) use extensively non-specific marker acute phase response clinical practice decade . More recently , CRP also propose new cardiovascular biomarker atherosclerosis complication . Studies investigate predictive value sub-acute CRP level relatively consistent show individual high hsCRP ( high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ) level ( &gt; 3.0 mg/L ) great risk CVD compare individual low ( &lt; 1.0 mg/L ) hsCRP level , independent gender plasma cholesterol concentration . Wobenzym enzyme formula primarily recommend treatment pain inflammation associate musculoskeletal disorder . Several study area arthritis post-surgery report acute anti-inflammatory effect Wobenzym term change CRP . Whether Wobenzym play role manage sub-acute inflammation well remain investigate .</detailed_description>
