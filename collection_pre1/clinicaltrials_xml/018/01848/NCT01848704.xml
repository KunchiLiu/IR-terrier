	<brief_summary>1Randomized control trial ( RCT ) gold standard therapeutic evaluation . Rapid dissemination trial result translation clinical practice particularly important . Abstracts publish presented conference large , rapid free method disseminate result . However , mode dissemination may serious consequence patient abstract accurate unbiased reflection trial result . Indeed , investigator great freedom write abstract article . They choose data present decide present . Consequently , many opportunity shape reader ' impression result , , add `` spin '' ( ie , spin specific way report convince reader beneficial effect ( efficacy , safety ) experimental treatment high show result ) . Objective : To assess impact spin interpretation result abstract randomized control trial nonstatistically significant result field cancer . Design : The investigator perform RCT compare interpretation result abstract ) b ) without spin . 1 . Identification abstract randomize trial spin . The investigator select sample negative publish RCTs ( i.e . non statistically significant result ) spin abstract conclusion identify previous work . Inclusion criteria 1 ) RCTs non statistically significant primary outcome , 2 ) spin abstract conclusion . 2 . Abstracts ' modification Selected abstract systematically rewrite contain `` spin '' . All abstract present format without name author , reference , name journal publish , name treatment mask use generic term ( e.g. , treatment A , comparator B ) . All abstract number word +/-20 3 . Assessment Abstracts assess correspond author randomize trial , expert specific grant investigator trial register clinicaltrials.gov . Experts invite participate study . They inform objective study . Each clinician randomize evaluate 1 abstract 1 abstract without spin . 4 . The primary endpoint interpretation abstract result participant . All reader participate study evaluate abstract randomize trial answer follow question : Based abstract , think treatment A would beneficial patient ? ( answer : numerical scale 0-10 )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator plan RCT unit randomization abstract . The planning , implementation , analysis writing study follow CONSORT Statement12 . Two type abstract evaluate : abstract without `` spin '' . Randomization characteristics The randomization list establish block 30 . So , participant could evaluate 1 abstract spin 1 abstract spin . The list block size disclose investigator . Allocation concealment obtain use computerized randomization system . If participant log system evaluate abstract , assessment exclude abstract automatically allocate next participant . Participants Eligibility criteria Evaluators participate study follow : 1 . The `` corresponding author '' publish RCTs field cancer . The investigator systematically search Medline via PubMed identify publication RCTs 2012 need 2011 , 2010 . The investigator collect e-mails `` corresponding author '' item . 2 . Experts French national grant field cancer All potential participant invite e-mail participate study interpretation result abstract clinical trial . If agree participate , use Internet link give access abstract assess . 3 . Investigators trial register clinicaltrials.gov Intervention comparators Selection abstract spin We select previous work personnel collection13-16 , 30 abstract 2 parallel arm negative RCTs ( ie , non-statistically significant primary outcome ) evaluate treatment field cancer spin abstract conclusion accord classification develop previously13 . We exclude abstract unusual type spin focus another study objective , spin relate safety , study compare treatment different dosage different mode administration different duration treatment . We also exclude abstract RCTs small sample size ( &lt; 100 ) . Abstract number 1 30 classify two category : 10 abstract ( number 11/12/14/16/20/22/24/27/28/30 ) high level spin ( i.e. , acknowledgment non statistically significant primary outcome conclusion ) 20 low level spin . Development abstract without spin The abstract spin systematically rewrite without spin . One researcher rewrote abstract accord specific guideline describe box . All abstract number word +/-25 . All abstract without spin evaluate independently another researcher disagreement discuss abstract modify accord consensus reach . Thus , study , investigator 2 version abstract : 1 spin 1 without spin . Abstracts without spin present format original abstract typography . The names author , reference , journal name , registration number , trial name acronym , article title delete , treatment name description systematically mask generic term ( e.g. , treatment A comparator B ) . If need information could help identify treatment delete . Outcomes Primary outcome The primary endpoint participant ' interpretation abstract . All study participant evaluate abstract . They answer follow question numerical scale grade 0 ( likely ) 10 ( likely ) â€¢ Based abstract , think treatment A would beneficial patient ? ( answer : numerical scale 0-10 ) Secondary outcomes The secondary endpoint assessment study quality , study importance , interest reading full text probability publish . For abstract , participant answer follow : - Rate overall rigor study methodology ? ( scale 0-10 ) - Rate importance study ( scale 0-10 ) - Are interested read full article study describe abstract ? ( scale 0-10 ) - Do think would interest run another trial evaluate treatment ? ( scale 0-10 ) Blinding The primary endpoint interpretation abstract participant . This outcome subjective . A recent study show lack blind responsible overestimation treatment effect randomize trial subjective primary endpoints17 . To minimize bias , investigator propose participant blind study hypothesis . All participant inform participate survey interpretation abstract clinical trial . They inform objective assumption study end study report result . Other data collect The investigator also collect change abstract term word delete word add abstract . Sample size Each participant read 1 abstract 1 abstract without spin . A sample 266 assessment abstract need show effect size 0.4 primary outcome assume mean difference 1 point common standard deviation base pilot study 2.5 power 90 % alpha risk equal 5 % . Thirty abstract spin 30 abstract without spin available . Theoretically , abstract must read number time accord randomization group . Considering element , necessary include 300 participant ( 150 arm ) . Each abstract read 5 time group ( abstract low level spin read 200 time ( 100 group ) abstract high level spin read 100 time ( 50 group ) ) . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis undertaken independently blindly use SAS v9.3 statistician Centre Clinical Epidemiology . A statistical analytic plan develop validated search database . The statistical analysis plan revise study take account amendment protocol change impact statistical analysis originally plan . All version keep file review . A T test use analysis primary secondary outcome . This statistical plan modify accord available data . For instance , number reading particular vignette unbalanced group , multi-level model ( mixed model cluster data ) use compare adjust mean primary outcome measure 2 arm . This mean statistical analysis adjust unbalanced repartition abstract group . The model apply secondary outcome subgroup abstract high level spin . A secondary analysis compare ICC reader abstract spin abstract without spin compute 95 % confidence interval difference ICCs ( bootstrap method ) .</detailed_description>
