	<brief_summary>White blood cell membrane surface structure affect metabolic disorder complication find diabetes mellitus . Therefore , cellular activation , signal propagation , intracellular signal well bactericidal effector function alter . When diabetic symptom correct systemic intervention treatment patient ( Anti-diabetic Therapy/ADT , i.e . anti-diabetic medication , diet dietetic supervision , physiotherapy physical exercise ) , white blood cell function normalize reach functionality comparable cell derive healthy subject . Gum diseases like periodontitis long associate termed complication uncontrolled diabetes mellitus . Vice versa , diabetic condition correct , periodontitis treatment proven effective , oral hygiene regimen , full mouth decontamination ( FD , i.e . oral use topical antiseptic prior professional mechanical tooth cleaning , tooth well root surface planing , polish well gum soft tissue decontamination combination systemic antibiotic ) perform . To reinforce gum healing , reinfection prevention ( RP ) well supportive periodontal therapy ( SPT ) administer dental professional individual basis detail schedule . If periodontal pocket critical participant 's self care eliminate FD include RP SPT , niche &gt; 5mm 6 month persist , patient inform offer surgical intervention indicate gum disease elimination . Dental follow exam offer participant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims 1 . To investigate cytosolic Ca2+- ( delta [ Ca2+ ] ) pH ( delta_pHi ) signal response bactericidal effector function PMN dependent upon status diabetic control reduce increase compare age gender match control 2 . To determine biochemical basis diabetic PMN alteration motility well bactericidal function : production superoxide release elastase , respectively 3 . To characterize molecular basis observe alteration regulation cytosolic calcium ( delta [ Ca2+ ] ) pH ( delta_pHi ) exhibit diabetic PMN 4 . To investigate pre-activated state alter bactericidal functionality diabetic PMN reverse patient ' glycemic control normalize , blood glucose level well periodontal disease correct 5 . To evaluate , systemic periodontal intervention lead clinical attachment gain patient diabetes mellitus type 2</detailed_description>
