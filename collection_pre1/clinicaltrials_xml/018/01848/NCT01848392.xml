	<brief_summary>Physical activity seem prognostic factor quality life survival patient cystic fibrosis ( CF ) . Whereas exercise capacity assess medical examination , daily physical activity little studied . Activity monitor measure physical activity study consider mainly respiratory status recently bone mineral density body composition . Determinants physical activity patient CF remain largely unknown . The objective study measure daily physical activity activity monitor adult patient CF investigate determinant physical activity , focus extra-respiratory factor ( nutritional status , diabetes , bone mineralization , anxiety and/or depression , cardiac impairment ) . Seventy adult patient CF , regularly care Cochin adult CF centre , recruit stable period annual review . During assessment , laboratory test carry ( especially parameters nutritional status ) , well measurement body composition bone mineral density , respiratory function test 6 minute walk test , echocardiography . Patients wear 7 consecutive day multi-sensor armband SenseWear arm , assess intensity physical activity metabolic equivalent ( METS ) step per day . Finally , patient complete three self-administered questionnaire : Quality Life ( CFQ14 + ) , hospital anxiety depression scale physical activity . After descriptive analysis study cohort , study qualitative quantitative criterion related physical activity ( assess quantitatively number steps/day metabolic equivalent ) . Linear regression model develop assess independent factor associate physical activity , adjust different variable interest relate patient demographic , behavioral , clinical ( respiratory non-respiratory ) biological parameter . Conversely , `` predictive '' independent aspect physical activity study accord respiratory function , nutritional status quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ambulatory adult CF patient recruit time yearly evaluation . Phenotypic patient ' characteristic Age , gender , CFTR genotype , pancreatic status ( presence absence exocrine pancreatic insufficiency ) , number IV antibiotic course number hospitalization previous year , report . Physical activity measurement Physical activity measure 7 consecutive day use multisensor armband ( SenseWear Pro Armband ; BodyMedia , Inc. , Pittsburgh , PA ) wear upper right arm triceps muscle . It incorporate biaxial accelerometer record step per day , physiologic indicator energy expenditure enable investigator determine physical activity level . Evaluation respiratory function cardiovascular status Patients perform respiratory function test evaluate FVC FEV1 six minute walk test . Arterial blood gas do begin end walk walk distance indicate meter . Echocardiography perform look leave right cardiac dysfunction measure systolic pulmonary artery pressure . N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide ( NT-pro-BNP ) use systemic biomarker heart failure . Bone mineral density ( BMD ) body composition They measure X-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA ) lumbar spine , femur whole body , measurement lean fat mass ( Lunar Prodigy ) . Nutritional evaluation Weight height measure body mass index ( BMI ) calculate . As part annual dietary assessment , evaluation amount ingest nitrogen . Blood drawn measure : albumin , prealbumin , vitamin E , vitamin A vitamin 25 ( OH ) D3 , HbA1c . C-reactive protein fibrinogen measure indicator inflammation . Urinalysis measure : creatinine , nitrogen 3-methylhistidine . Oral glucose tolerance test perform ( fast blood glucose blood glucose 2 hour ingest 75 g glucose ) pancreatic insufficient patient unknown diabetes . Self-administered questionnaire Patients answer 3 questionnaire : 1. quality life CFQ14+ questionnaire 2. hospital anxiety depression ( HAD ) scale validate French 3 . Baecke physical activity questionnaire</detailed_description>
