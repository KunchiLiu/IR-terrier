	<brief_summary>People Sickle Cell Anemia ( HbSS ) produce red blood cell short lifespan . These red blood cell breakdown faster , call hemolysis . When red blood cell breakdown , tiny amount Carbon Monoxide ( CO ) release blood eliminate exhale breath . This research study use device call CoSense™ , measure Carbon Monoxide ( CO ) level breath . The purpose study see well device measure CO level individual breathes .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carbon Monoxide Monitor Measurement End-Tidal Carbon Monoxide Levels Children With Without Hemolysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects diagnose homozygous sickle cell anemia ( Hb SS ) red blood cell decrease lifespan , lead increase rate heme turnover . Carbon monoxide ( CO ) by-product heme oxidation excrete exhaled breath . The concentration CO end-tidal breath measure used indicate rate heme oxidation , bilirubin production presence hemolysis . The objective study characterize performance CoSense™ child without sickle cell anemia . This single-center , open-label , non-randomized , proof concept study characterize ability CoSense™ ass ETCO level subject diagnosis sickle cell anemia ( Hb SS ) . Up 40 child ( 5-14 year old ) , 20 participant diagnosis Hb SS , enrol . Each participant two breath sample collect non-invasively , one immediately . It take approximately 120 second collect breath sample . This study investigational device non-significant risk patient . The nasal cannula make biocompatibility-tested polyvinyl chloride ( PVC ) material soft open-end , gently place adjacent one nostrils partially insert approximately 5 mm . The objective study assess reproducibility ETCO measurement comparison ETCO level child diagnose Hb SS healthy child . The study would help development portable CO measurement device potential health application monitoring disease alter bilirubin metabolism .</detailed_description>
