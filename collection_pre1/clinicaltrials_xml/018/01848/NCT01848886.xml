	<brief_summary>Coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) use radial artery ( RA ) since ninety go revival . The initially reported bad outcome RA graft patient compare patient graft saphenous vein ( SV ) since correct . Studies show well patency use RA , RA go prefer especially young patient long time patency critical . During last 10 year endoscopic techniques harvest RA evolve . Multiple different technique use , equipment technique refine highly reliable . The investigator hypothesize endoscopic technique less complication good patency open harvest . There also two possible way use RA graft . One way sew onto aorta another way sew onto mammarian artery . The investigator hypothesize use mammarian artery superior revascularisation technique good patency sew directly onto aorta .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives The present trial patient undergo CABG ( 1 ) evaluate complication endoscopic versus traditionally harvest radial artery , ( 2 ) evaluate graft patency endoscopic harvest radial artery versus open technique , ( 3 ) evaluate use mammario-radial graft versus aorto-radial grafting . Design trial size The NEO Trial randomise clinical trial 2x2 factorial design . We plan randomise 300 participant four intervention group : ( 1 ) mammario-radial endovascular group ; ( 2 ) aorto-radial endovascular group ; ( 3 ) mammario-radial open group ( 4 ) aorto-radial open group . A subgroup 100 participant select undergo special scan vascular perfusion donor control hand ( MIBI scan ) . The evaluation graft patency ischaemia arm blind assessment primary outcome handfunction three month non-blinded evaluated questionnaire . Trial intervention Trial 1 : The experimental procedure trial endoscopic radial artery harvest ( ERAH ) . The control intervention open radial artery harvest ( ORAH ) . Trial 2 : The experimental procedure trial technique radial artery sewn onto mammarian artery mammario-radial anastomosis ( composite/Y-graft ) . The control intervention technique sew radial artery directly onto aorta aorto-radial anastomosis ( free radial artery ) . Inclusion exclusion criterion All patient refer department sub acute elective coronary bypass operation eligible trial inclusion . Inclusion criterion : 18 year old ; able willing give inform consent ; multi-vessel disease . Exclusion criterion : off-pump procedure ; multi-procedure ( i.e . concomitant valve surgery ) ; contrast allergy ; geographically available follow-up ; Allen 's test insufficient ulnary artery perfusion ; informed consent ; acute operation ; dialysis ; preoperative neurological deficit donor arm ; leave ventricle ejection fraction ( LVEF ) less 20 % ; former sternotomy malignant disease . Primary secondary outcome Trial 1 : The primary outcome evaluation hand function three month . The secondary outcome : occurrence neurophysiological defect donor arm assess examination cutaneous sensibility measurement sensory motoric nervous conduction velocity preoperatively three month ; change subjective cutaneous sensibility assess clinical examination three month ; complication assess composite haematoma formation , wind dehiscence infection register discharge three month . We also assess number exploratory outcome ( serious adverse event , reoperation bleeding , revascularisation , myocardial infarction , stroke death , handgrip strength , muscular function hand , scar evaluation , vascular supply hand , graft patency participant subjective evaluation hand function 1 year ) . Trial 2 : The primary outcome occurrence cardio- cerebrovascular event first year surgery compare mammario-radial versus aorto-radial graft . As exploratory outcome also assess graft patency multi-slice computer tomography ( MSCT ) compare mammarioradial versus aortoradial graft one year surgery . Time schedule Randomisation commence 15th May 2013 . The inclusion period altogether 300 participant expect last three year .</detailed_description>
