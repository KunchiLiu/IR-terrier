	<brief_summary>This two-part study healthy adult . Part A phase 1 , non-randomized , open label , single-dose , single-centre mass balance study utilize radiolabeled dose investigate recovery , excretion , pharmacokinetics oral GSK1265744 cohort 6 healthy adult male subject . Subjects undergo pre-study screening visit within 30 day first dose successfully pass pre-study assessment meet eligibility criterion enrol study receive equivalent 30 mg dose GSK1265744 oral solution , contain approximately 70 microcuries ( mcg Ci ) [ 0.96 millisieverts ( mSv ) ] radioactivity fast condition . Blood , urine fecal sample collect maximum 504 hour ( 21 day ) follow study drug administration . In Part B , approximately 10 healthy male female subject enrol evaluate single-dose safety , tolerability PK supratherapeutic dose GSK1265744 150 mg compare placebo . Each subject receive single dose GSK1265744 150 mg placebo Day 1 fast condition morning . Blood , urine fecal sample collect 336 hour ( 14 day ) follow dosing .</brief_summary>
