	<brief_summary>Obese patient Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) 80-98 % chance disease cure improved follow bariatric surgery . This could explain weight loss change nutrient absorption gut hormone secretion . The comparison glucose metabolism patient undergo malabsorptive mechanical procedure clarify matter . EndoBarrier endoscopically deliver device mimic malabsorptive surgical procedure endoscopically place intragastric balloon induces weight loss mechanical action . The present study hypothesis bypass first portion intestine obtain EndoBarrier effective improve glucose metabolism reduction food intake obtain intragastric balloon . Since similar weight loss expect two group , study aid understanding mechanism behind metabolic improvement see intestine bypass .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EndoBarrier Versus Intragastric Balloon Obese Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bariatric surgery effective therapy obesity . Malabsorption-based surgical technique ( exclude first part gastrointestinal tract alimentary circuit ) also effective correct T2D , even significant weight loss occur . Proposed mechanism explain beneficial effect include caloric restriction , alter secretion gut hormone due duodenal exclusion due contact undigested food jejunal mucosa , pancreatic islet hyperfunction , change intestinal flora , mucosal inflammation , and/or change biliary acid re-circulation . EndoBarrier endoscopically deliver device mimic malabsorptive surgical procedure endoscopically place intragastric balloon induces weight loss mechanical action . The present study prospective , randomized clinical trial . It compare metabolic compensation patient treat EndoBarrier patient treat Intragastric Balloon . The aim : comparison glycemic control measure hemoglobin A1c ( HbA1c ) , change oral hypoglycemic drug consumption body loss baseline follow two group ; evaluation mechanism implicate glycemic control measure basal stimulate insular hormone , glucose level gastrointestinal hormone ; creation bio-bank dedicate database collect biological sample future study . Obese adult T2D patient ( BMI â‰¥ 30 ) diabetes duration &lt; 10 year randomize receive either EndoBarrier ( n=45 ) Intragastric Balloon ( n=45 ) . The device implant keep place first 12 month study remove . Clinical biochemical data collect every 3 month 12 month implant subsequent 12 month removal . Statistics describe variable baseline , subsequent visit end study produce group patient . The Student 's t-test use cross-sectional analysis mixed model system use longitudinal observation . Multivariate analysis also apply good characterize difference may see two group .</detailed_description>
