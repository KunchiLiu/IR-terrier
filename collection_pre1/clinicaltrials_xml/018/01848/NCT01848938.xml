After , answer web questionnaire finally interview researcher confirm diagnosis SUI ascertain patient well inform study procedure . Women randomize either two group . Women smartphone group get smartphone application iphone android . Follow-up three month web questionnaire leakage diary . After wait group get smartphone application . We aim recruit 120 woman age 18 old via website www.tät.nu . In power calculation assume improvement symptom score ( ICIQ UI SF ) QOL score ( ICIQ luts QOL ) smartphone group similar improvement find postal group previous study . We also assume wait group improve extent . To detect difference group , power 80 % , 2-side test significance 0,05 , group size follow ICIQ UI SF Smartphone group improve 2.9 ( SD3,1 ) wait group 1,0 ( SD2,0 ) ; 30 group ICIQ luts QOL Smartphone group improve 4.6 ( SD6,7 ) wait group 2.0 ( SD3.0 ) , 35 group PGI ( patient´s global impression improvement ) . 26,5 % improve much much ( smartphone ) 4 % ( wait group ) :39 group We expect drop rate 33 % thus need approximately 120 person , 60 group .</detailed_description>
