	<detailed_description>Diffuse large B cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) common non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma , account 30 % 50 % patient . Although consider curable disease , still least 40 % patient fail first line chemotherapy . The International Prognostic Index ( IPI ) score age adjust IPI ( aIPI ) use since publish identify patient different outcome . CHOP chemotherapy administer every 21 day year standard therapy advance DLBCL achieve long term overall survival ( OS ) 40 % . Many study show addition monoclonal antibody Rituximab improve patient survival achieve high rate event-free survival elderly patient , favourable unfavourable IPI score . R-CHOP also improve survival young patient favourable IPI score . There standard therapy young patient DLBCL unfavourable IPI score . The survival patient remain poor , EFS around 40 % . The combination RCHOP new drug attractive approach treat patient . The investigator propose phase II randomize clinical trial young patient unfavourable IPI score DLBCL use 6 cycle combination subcutaneous Bortezomib R-CAP ( RCHOP without vincristine , avoid neuropathy ) compare standard immunochemotherapy regimen R- CHOP every 21 day . The goal evaluate proportion patient Event-Free Survival ( EFS ) 2 year , diagnosis DLBCL aIPI &gt; 1 aIPI =1 increase level beta-2-microglobulin ( Upper Limits Normal ) .</detailed_description>
