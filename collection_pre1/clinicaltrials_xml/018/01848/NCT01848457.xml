	<brief_summary>Osteosarcoma common type bone cancer child , adolescent young adult . Treatment surgery combination three conventional chemotherapy drug cure nearly two-thirds patient osteosarcoma , treatment also cause irreversible damage kidney cause permanent hearing loss . The purpose study evaluate new approach prevent side effect without interfere beneficial effect chemotherapy drug cancer use knowledge drug damage kidney cochlear hair cell ear selectively block side effect . Preventing side effect without interfere anti-cancer effect drug improve outcome survivor may also improve effectiveness chemotherapy regimen prevent treatment delay dose reduction often cause side effect . Patients carefully monitor ensure new intervention adversely affect response treatment increase side effect chemotherapy . Specifically , monitor nutritional status patient closely ask patient complete survey describe side effect treatment cycle . We also collect small sample cancer tissue time biopsy surgery patient study test determine new class anti-cancer drug currently development may role treat osteosarcoma . If effective , new approach prevent kidney damage hearing loss applicable type cancer treat chemotherapy drug .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Preventing Nephrotoxicity Ototoxicity From Osteosarcoma Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Current osteosarcoma treatment regimens include cisplatin high-dose methotrexate ( HDMTX ) , nephrotoxic ototoxic , damage kidney cochlear hair cell may irreversible . Preventing toxicity improve outcome long-term survivor may also prevent short-term treatment delay dose reduction compromise efficacy treatment regimen allow administration higher cumulative dos cisplatin . This pilot study evaluate pharmacologically-based approach prevent nephrotoxic effect HDMTX prolong infusion duration thereby lower risk drug precipitation renal tubule ; selectively block uptake cisplatin renal tubular cell cochlear hair cell inhibit organic cation transporter 2 ( OCT2 ) proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) , pantoprazole . Participants previously untreated biopsy-proven , localized metastatic osteosarcoma receive six cycle standard MAP chemotherapy regimen , include high-dose methotrexate , doxorubicin cisplatin . The first 2 cycle administer neoadjuvantly follow surgery remove primary tumor , feasible . A novel randomize , crossover , 2 x 2 factorial clinical trial design allow patient receive new intervention prevent toxicity serve control . New , sensitive urinary biomarkers acute kidney injury serve primary endpoint evaluate treatment-related renal damage . Ototoxicity monitor use audiogram . The effect intervention tumor response ( radiographic histologic ) toxicity ( include patient report outcome survey nutritional status ) closely monitor . Other secondary objective include evaluate bone-specific alkaline phosphatase biomarker tumor burden construct tissue microarray evaluate expression proteins responsible resistance current drug use treat osteosarcoma assess expression protein target new anticancer drug development childhood cancer .</detailed_description>
