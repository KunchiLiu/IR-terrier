	<brief_summary>Title : Randomized cross-over study patient preference oral intravenous vinorelbine treatment advance NSCLC . A phase IV study . ShortTitle/ Acronym : VIVOS Protocol Code : IRST162.05 Study Design : Randomized , open label cross-over study Study Duration : Two year Study Center ( ) : Multicenter study Objectives : Primary : Patient preference oral intravenous vinorelbine Secondary : Overall Response Rate , Time Progression , Toxicity , Survival , Subjective reason treatment choice . Number Subjects : 120 Diagnosis Main Inclusion Criteria : Patients affect stage IIIB stage IV NSCLC candidate receive first line chemotherapy vinorelbine due age ≥ 70 Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance status ≤2 age ≤ 70 ECOG PS ≥ 2 Study Product , Dose , Route , Regimen duration administration : - Arm A : first cycle IV vinorelbine ( 30 mg/m2 ) second cycle PO vinorelbine ( 60mg/m2 ) - Arm B : first cycle PO vinorelbine ( 60mg/m2 ) follow second cycle IV vinorelbine ( 30mg/m2 ) In arm vinorelbine give day 1 day 8 every 3 week . From third cycle onwards patient choose receive oral intravenous vinorelbine . Vinorelbine capsule administer dosage 60 mg/m2 first course may increase 80 mg/m² physician 's choice . Treatment repeat every 21 day continue disease progression , intolerable toxicity patient refusal . Reference therapy : Vinorelbine 30 mg/m2 intravenous day 1 8 every 21 day Statistical Methodology : The sample size calculate base 75 % patient prefer `` oral '' vinorelbine 25 % prefer `` intravenous '' vinorelbine . Therefore , investigator would compare patient prefer `` oral '' vinorelbine 75 % compare null hypothesis 50 % ( difference proportion patient prefer `` oral '' `` intravenous '' ) . With 80 % power total alpha 0.05 , estimate sample size 60 group ( 120 total ) . During recruitment period , formal interim analysis plan 60 patient ( 30 group ) enrol , p-value &lt; 0.0001 . To claim statistical significance final analysis , overall p-value still 5 % ( refer Peto-Haybittle rule ) .</brief_summary>

Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan . See section 9.2 Appendix E evaluation measurable disease . 4 . Patients asymptomatic brain metastasis eligible 5 . Patients recurrent disease previous surgery eligible 6 . Life expectancy &gt; 3 month 7 . Patients must normal organ marrow function 8 . Female participant child bear potential male participant whose partner child bear potential must willing ensure partner use effective contraception study 3 month thereafter 9 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document The participant may enter study ANY follow apply : 1 . Patients previous chemotherapy lung cancer radiotherapy target lesion . 2 . Participation another clinical trial investigational agent within 30 day prior study screen . 3 . Presence infection . 4 . Preexisting clinically significant peripheral neuropathy . 5 . History evidence malabsorption syndrome disease may significantly affect gastrointestinal function . 6 . Patients know symptomatic uncontrolled brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . 7 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition vinorelbine agent use study . 8 . Presence medical problem sufficient severity prevent full compliance study . 9 . Other know malignant neoplastic disease patient 's medical history diseasefree interval le 5 year ( except previously treat basal cell carcinoma situ carcinoma uterine cervix ) ;</criteria>
