	<brief_summary>Compared chronic dialysis , kidney transplantation provide recipient longer survival well quality life low cost . In order meet increase demand kidney allograft , kidney older sicker donor procure . This lead great discard rate donate kidney well complication recipient , include short allograft survival . Available clinical model predict kidney allograft quality poor prognostic ability ass degree kidney allograft injury . However , allograft injury near time procurement lead major consequence transplant recipient : great risk delay graft function , poor allograft function premature loss transplant . Our proposal base hypothesis novel biomarkers measure donor urine transport medium time procurement assess acute chronic kidney injury distinct biomarker pattern predict allograft survival . In collaboration four organ procurement organization , collect urine sample consecutive deceased donor sample transport solution every pump kidney . We measure marker injury , repair , inflammation fibrosis . We determine mortality allograft survival patient linkage United Network Organ Sharing ( UNOS ) database ( Overall Cohort ) . Additionally , perform detailed chart review subset recipient ( detailed cohort ) also examine association biomarkers longitudinal graft function five year transplant . Early , non-invasive rapid assessment donor kidney injury could drive good allocation decision potentially reduce rate post-transplant complication . Further , new tool could provide platform clinical trial therapy allografts kidney transplant recipient aim ameliorate allograft injury .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our study several key process develop tested address scientific aim : 1 . Enrollment We collect urine sample approximately 1600 decease donor approximately 600 perfusate sample machine-pumped kidney participate organ procurement organization ( OPOs ) . We estimate final donor group comprise 55 % standard criterion donor , 25 % expanded-criteria donor 10 % donor cardiac death . Approximately , 20 % kidney discard . 2 . Donor Data Donor variables come two source : United Network Organ Sharing ( UNOS ) database detail data abstraction OPO . The UNOS database provide data donor demographic important clinical characteristic . The additional data collect OPO staff capture granular information event surround donor death , include UNOS database . These data available enrolled donor include variable serial serum creatinine , nadir blood pressure , medication vasopressor use , machine pump parameter . 3 . Overall Recipient Cohort Over 2000 recipient receive kidney decease donor study . The Overall Cohort comprise recipient General demographic clinical characteristic recipient Overall Cohort come UNOS database . For Overall Recipient Cohort , ascertain delay graft function ( DGF ) center report UNOS . We ascertain allograft failure center report UNOS new episode wait-listing re-transplant collect UNOS , Recipient mortality ascertain center report UNOS/SRTR Social Security Death Master File . 4 . Detailed Recipient Cohort A subset 800 recipient Overall Cohort transplantation collaborate transplant center comprise cohort . For Detailed Subcohort , on-site coordinator perform manual chart review abstract extensive data recipient include dialysis indication post-transplant , comorbidities , specific dose immunosuppression . For Detailed Subcohort , also collect data clinical event five year transplantation , include acute rejection estimate glomerular filtration rate time transplantation month 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 , 48 60 month transplant . 5 . Novel biomarkers measure urine perfusate</detailed_description>
