	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose alisertib give together abiraterone acetate prednisone see well work treat patient hormone-resistant prostate cancer . Alisertib abiraterone acetate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Androgens cause growth prostate cancer cell . Drugs , abiraterone acetate , may also lessen amount androgen make body . Drugs use chemotherapy , prednisone , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving alisertib , abiraterone acetate , prednisone together may effective treatment prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alisertib , Abiraterone Acetate Prednisone Treating Patients With Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : 1 . Phase I : To determine safe dose alisertib give combination abiraterone ( abiraterone acetate ) prednisone metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) patient disease progression abiraterone prednisone . 2 . Phase II : To determine proportion patient disease progression alisertib add abiraterone prednisone . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : 1 . Phase II : To determine prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) kinetics alisertib add abiraterone prednisone regimen ( include proportion patient PSA progression free 3 month , proportion patient 50 % PSA reduction study treatment , maximum PSA decline baseline first 12 week ) . 2 . Phase II : To compare baseline circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) enumeration 12 week post-therapy CTC enumeration . 3 . Phase II : To compare baseline neuroendocrine marker ( chromogranin A neuron-specific enolase [ NSE ] ) level 12 week post therapy neuroendocrine marker level . 4 . Phase II : To assess overall safety combination alisertib abiraterone prednisone phase 1 portion study . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose escalation study alisertib follow phase II study . Patients receive alisertib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-7 , abiraterone acetate PO daily , prednisone PO BID . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
