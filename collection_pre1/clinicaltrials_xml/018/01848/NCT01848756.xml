	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy SNX-5422 Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 ( HER2 ) Positive Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heat shock protein 90 ( Hsp90 ) chaperone proteins stabilize well 200 different know client protein help fold correctly take rightful position cell . Hsp90 special fondness oncoproteins whose structure shift accord functional state . Among Hsp90 's client , surprising number well recognize target oncology , include human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) . SNX-5422 pro-drug SNX-2112 , potent , highly selective , small-molecule inhibitor molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 ( Hsp90 ) . Treatment HER2-positive cell line BT-474 Hsp90 inhibitor SNX-2112 result cellular degradation , decreased level phospho-AKT/cyclin D1 , increase apoptosis . Furthermore , treatment SNX-5542 cause tumor regression , include remission HER2-overexpressing breast cancer xenograft model . SNX-5422 demonstrated significant antitumor activity mouse xenograft model various human malignancy , include breast ( BT474 , MX-1 ) , lung ( H1975 , H1650 , EBC-1 ) , colon ( HT29 ) , prostate ( PC3 ) , melanoma ( A375 ) multiple oral dosing regimen .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Males nonpregnant , nonbreastfeeding female . Confirmed diagnosis locally advance metastatic breast , esophagogastric , urothelial , nonsmall cell lung cancer . Histological cytological confirm carcinoma HER2 amplification ( IHC 3+ FISH+ ( &gt; 2 HER2 : CEP17 ) ) . Subjects advance metastatic breast cancer must receive 5 prior line anticancer therapy , include trastuzumab ( exclude hormonal treatment ) . Subjects advance metastatic HER2 positive esophagogastric cancer must receive 5 prior line anticancer therapy , include trastuzumab . Subjects advance metastatic , urothelial carcinoma nonsmall cell lung cancer must receive least one , 5 prior line anticancer therapy . Measurable disease use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 . Life expectancy least 3 month . Karnofsky performance score ≥70 . Adequate baseline laboratory assessment Recovered toxicity previous anticancer therapy , exception CTCAE grade 1 sensory neuropathy .

At increase risk develop prolonged QT interval Patients chronic diarrhea grade 2 great diarrhea despite maximal medical management . Gastrointestinal disease condition could affect drug absorption , include gastric bypass . Gastrointestinal disease could alter assessment safety , include irritable bowel syndrome , ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease , hemorrhagic coloproctitis . History document adrenal dysfunction due malignancy . Known seropositive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) . History chronic liver disease . Active hepatitis A B . Current alcohol dependence drug abuse .
