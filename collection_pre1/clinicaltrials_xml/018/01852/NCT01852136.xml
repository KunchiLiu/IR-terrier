	<brief_summary>This prospective , multi-center , 2 period cross-over study design determine people use injection pen subcutaneous medication delivery prefer BD NEXT pen needle ( PN ) comparison currently market pen needle similar gauge length . Subjects use investigational ( BD NEXT ) PN usual conventional PN one week randomly assign sequence , ask evaluate compare characteristic BD NEXT pen needle versus usual pen needle use pen injection perform home . Since injection experience may vary accord type pen device use , equal number subject recruit user three commonly use insulin pen injector .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Evaluation BD NEXT Pen Needle</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using usual insulin dos , pen injection routine , subject ask compare two different pen needle ( PNs ) correspond gauge ( GA ) length , one investigational ( extra thin wall ) pen needle often , currently use pen needle . Based current pen needle gauge length , subject assign BD NEXT pen needle comparable gauge ( G ) length , millimeter ( mm ) . The three possible size BD NEXT 32G x 4mm pen needle , BD NEXT 31G x 5mm pen needle , BD NEXT 31G x 8 mm pen needle . Both study pen needle use subject pen device/insulin brand . If subject use two different pen , comparison data collect pen device . Each subject participate three study visit course approximately 3 week . Study conduct include two in-home use study period last approximately ( 1 ) one week . During Visit 1 , subject enrol assigned pen device group , subject randomly assign use BD NEXT usual PN use 1 week home use period ( Period 1 ) . After approximately 1 week , Visit 2 , subject crossed-over study PN per randomization schedule . After approximately 1 week home use second study PN ( Period 2 ) , Visit 3 , subject ask complete Visual Analog Scales ( VAS ) answer question compare injection experience two different PNs . The primary secondary objective assess pen user combine . In addition , preference , thumb force , confidence full dose delivery compare among subset subject use follow pen device : sanofi-aventis SoloSTAR® , Lilly KwikPen™ , Novo Nordisk FlexPen® . In order achieve minimum 60 evaluable subject pen user group approximately 210 subject enrol ( 70 subject per pen group ) .</detailed_description>
