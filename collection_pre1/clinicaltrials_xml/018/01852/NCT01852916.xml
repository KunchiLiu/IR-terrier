	<brief_title>NHFOV Versus NCPAP Prevent Exubation Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Extremely preterm infant frequently need place back invasive mechanical ventilation follow initial attempt remove mode respiratory support . Continued mechanical ventilation think primary driver development chronic lung disease major component adverse developmental outcome infant . Infants fail first trial removal ventilation apnea respiratory failure . Animal study early clinical experience suggest possible effectively provide ventilation via high frequency nasal ventilation . In animal model mode ventilation appear provide good lung development less injury . Nasal CPAP show improve success rate extubation mechanical ventilation prevent post extubation atelectasis resultant improvement gas exchange . However many premature infant , poorly develop control respiratory drive major problem despite treatment caffeine , mechanical ventilation need . High frequency nasal ventilation may support ventilation enough apneic period mitigate need traditional mechanical ventilation . Use non-invasive mode may result decrease incidence severity chronic lung problem developmental disability group infant . Extremely premature infant ( GA &lt; 28 week ) less 7 day old randomize either NHFV nCPAP follow first attempt extubation removal mechanical ventilation . All infant receive least load dose caffeine citrate ( 10 mg/kg caffeine base equivalent prior extubation . Initial nCPAP level determine clinical staff least equal level positive end expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) use mechanical ventilation . A similar level pressure use initial mean airway pressure ( MAP ) infant receive HFNV . The primary outcome need reintubation first 7 day extubation attempt due preset criterion . Crossover modality allow period . Infants may remain HFNF beyond 7 day primary endpoint deem necessary clinical staff . Weaning HFNV nCPAP allow 7 day primary study period reinstitution HFNF allow initially randomize mode respiratory support . The magnitude effect size determine study base sample size calculation . A pragmatic sample size 20 infant select ( 10 arm ) allow estimation potential effect size . Further study ( y ) need perform show conclusively efficacy ( lack ) NHFV prevent post-extubation respiratory failure use prevent chronic lung disease improve developmental outcome .</detailed_description>
