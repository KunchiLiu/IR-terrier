	<brief_summary>The purpose multicenter trial ass efficacy safety MK-7622 compare placebo adjunctive therapy acetylcholinesterase inhibitor ( AChEIs ) symptomatic treatment participant mild moderate Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) . The trial consist two stage : Stage 1 Stage 2 . Participants Stage 1 randomized receive either placebo MK-7622 45 mg daily . In Stage 2 , participant randomize receive either placebo , MK-7622 5 , 15 45 mg daily . Participants enrol one stage . Interim analyse perform Stage 1 Stage 2 determine whether trial continue . Duration stage approximately 26 week ; participant receive placebo time trial . The primary study hypothesis follow : Stage 1 - MK-7622 45 mg daily superior placebo improve cognition participant mild moderate AD assess mean change baseline 11-item Alzheimer 's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale ( ADAS-Cog11 ) Week 12 ; Stage 2 - At least one top two dos MK-7622 ( 15 mg daily , 45 mg daily ) superior placebo improve cognition participant mild moderate AD assess mean change baseline ADAS-Cog11 Week 12 .</brief_summary>
