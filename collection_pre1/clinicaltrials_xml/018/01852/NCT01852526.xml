	<brief_title>Efficacy Hybrid Systems Comparison Rigid Spondylodesis Lumbar-spine Fusion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients 30 year age present outpatient clinic degenerative disc disease spondylolisthesis indication monosegmental lumbar spine fusion eligible trial inclusion . Indication fusion procedure state earlier 6 month conservative therapy . Patients spondylolisthesis respond positively facet joint injection . Radiologic inclusion criterion summarize appendix . Prerequisite inclusion presence radiologic degeneration adjacent segment ( Pfirrmann grade II-IV MRI finding ) without sign instability . Definition radiologic clinical instability well inclusion criterion summarize appendix . Study subject approach recruit experienced spine surgeon . A number 150 patient per year , undergo primary monosegmental fusion department , estimate screening procedure . A recruitment rate 30 patient per year anticipate . Patients receive one two treatment : Conventional monosegmental posterior lumbar intervertebral fusion ( PLIF ) Hybrid system ( PLIF + flexible pedicle screw system fusion ) Control group - conventional PLIF The control group receive monosegmental posterior lumbar spine fusion intervertebral cage ( PLIF ) . This current well-established therapy several pathology lumbar spine ( e.g . spondylolisthesis , degenerative disc disease ) . Thus , control group receive standard care . This acceptable control/comparison trial kind . Surgery perform use follow device : S4速 AESCULAP AG , Cage : Wave速 Cage , Fa . AMT速 Intervention group - hybrid system The intervention group receive hybrid system PLIF flexible pedicle screw system fusion . Surgery perform use follow device : S4速 Dynamic rod : AESCULAP AG ( Tuttlingen ) Only skilled spine surgeon ( experience least 30 fusion-procedures ) participate trial . Intraoperative photo documentation help prevent variation procedure ( e.g . enlargement decompression/approach ) . We also provide instructional movie standard procedure rating x-ray . All patient receive surgical drain , remove 2 day post-surgery . Both group patient receive physical therapy , begin day surgery . Patients discharge sufficient convalescence unremarkable wound healing . Hospital admission last 8-10 day necessary . Physical therapy perform inpatient period . After hospital discharge , physical therapy continue outpatient condition . This therapy standardize order reflect reality . Adverse Serious Adverse Events Adverse Event An Adverse Event untoward medical occurrence study patient may may causal relationship study treatment . Abnormal laboratory test value record AE require treatment . 1 . Concomitant Diseases In context , deterioration pre-existing disease also regard Adverse Event . But regard Adverse Event due treatment already plan patient enrol study . 2 . Pregnancy In study , occurrence pregnancy consider Adverse Event . Before surgery , laboratory test conduct exclude pregnancy woman 50 year age . 3 . Laboratory Test Values Any abnormal laboratory test value study check plausibility evaluate clinical relevance responsible investigator . If study , abnormal test value find , baseline visit , consider clinically relevant , consider clinically relevant , must record AE eCRF . Serious Adverse Event The present clinical study subject Sections 20-23a German Medical Product Law ( Medizinproduktgesetz - MPG ) , definition apply . A Serious Adverse Event untoward occurrence clinical trial performance evaluation text subject approval - directly indirectly lead death ; - lead , could lead , could lead serious deterioration state health study subject , user another person , irrespective whether occurrence cause medical product . This definition SAE serve basis documentation Serious Adverse Events study . . Ascertainment AE SAE The study centre concern responsible record report AEs SAEs . The study director/main investigator ensure person involve treatment study patient fully aware responsibility event Adverse Events . At visit , patient ask experienced Adverse/Serious Events . The Adverse Events record patient ' medical record survey questionnaires . At visit , physician review patient ' medical record determine whether Adverse Events occur . If Adverse Event occurs , patient question , irrespective causal relationship Adverse Event study treatment , must keep constant supervision . In case , patient must remain observation symptom subside , laboratory test value return acceptable level , plausible explanation find Adverse Event , patient die , discharge study ( last visit 6 month 36 month ) . All Adverse Events record CFR , include follow information : - Time date start end - Gravity - Relationship study therapy - Serious serious - Expected expect</detailed_description>
