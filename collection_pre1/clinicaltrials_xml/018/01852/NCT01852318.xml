Pregabalin , another gabaergic drug structurally related gabapentin , advantage gabapentin term rapid response stressful symptom . Only two recently small-scaled study evaluate effect pregabalin UP . However , study randomize , placebo-controlled trail . Studies focus treatment UP limit study compare efficacy pregabalin antihistamine , widely use therapy UP currently , conduct . Additionally . study investigate effect drug use UP QoL outcomes , though UP great impact patient ' QoL . As UP still one vex disable symptom patient ESRD , decide multicenter , randomize double-blind placebo-controlled trial ( RCT ) large sample size long duration . Objectives : To investigate efficacy safety pregabalin , compare fexofenadine placebo , treatment uremic pruritus . Methods : This multicenter RCT . Haemodialysis patient establish UP enrol multiple medical center Taiwan . All patient randomly allocate receive one three treatment —pregabalin 75mg daily , fexofenadine 60 mg daily , placebo—for 12 week . The primary endpoint study change visual analogue score pruritus score . The change QoL measure , include Skindex-10 , Brief Itching Inventory Itch Medical Outcomes Study , also assess , therapy . Safety assess visit throughout study . A follow-up visit perform 2 week administration final dose study</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients endstage renal disease ( ESRD ) maintenance hemodialysis twice weekly least three month suffer uremic pruritus . 20 Years old Definition uremic pruritus : Patients consider pruritus either following condition : least 3 episode itch period 2 week less , symptom appear time day , last least minute , trouble patient appearance itch regular pattern period 6 month , less frequently list . To define `` uremic , '' pruritus appear shortly onset dialysis , time , without evidence active disease could explain pruritus . Patients suffer severe pruritus unresponsive topical emollient corticosteroid , diagnose uremic pruritus dermatologists 1 . All patient pruritus attributable cause , scabies evident skin disease ( atopic dermatitis , psoriasis , generalize dermatitis , pediculosis , urticaria …etc ) , medication potential pruritic property . 2 . Patients whose pruritus occur dialysis 3 . Patients receive oral drug presume antipruritic effect , include benzodiazepine , muscle relaxant , opioid analgesic , tricyclic antidepressant antiepileptic drug , ultraviolet B phototherapy past one week prior participate trial trial . 4 . Concomitant elevation liver enzyme ( GOT : male &gt; 37 U/L , female : &gt; 31 U/L , GPT : male &gt; 41 U/L , female : &gt; 31U/L ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP &gt; 104U/L ) , bilirubin ( Tbil &gt; 1.2 mg/dL ) , serum phosphorus ( &gt; 7 mg/dl ) , serum parathyroid hormone ( &gt; 300 pg/ml ) . 5 . Patients history allergy pregabalin , acute illness , liver cirrhosis , hepatic failure , decompensated heart failure , inability give inform consent , poor compliance . 6 . Patients uncontrolled psychiatric disease , active malignancy , untreated hypothyroidism . 7 . Female patient pregnant , nursing , want become pregnant .</criteria>
