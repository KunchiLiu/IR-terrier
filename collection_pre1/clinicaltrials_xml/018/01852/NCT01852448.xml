	<brief_summary>Cystic fibrosis relate diabetes ( CFRD ) associate bad CF-relevant outcome . The mechanisms underlying CFRD development fully understood , recent evidence suggest Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( T2DM ) mechanism may involve may involve incretins ( gut secrete hormone augment insulin secretion response nutrient load ) . This study examine prevalence Genome wide association study ( GWAS ) -implicated T2DM allele ( include TCF7L2 ) across spectrum glucose abnormality CF use information compare incretin insulin secretion non-diabetic child adult high risk low risk allele .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CFRD associate bad nutritional status , great pulmonary function decline , increased mortality , highlight relevance CF arise primarily compromise insulin secretion -- traditionally consider by-product pancreatic exocrine tissue damage fibrosis . Recent development field diabetes propel re-examination basic explanation . Genome-wide association study associate genetic variant TCF7L2 , transcription factor implicate enteroendocrine function , increase susceptibility T2DM CFRD . The Objectives study perform target sequence TCF7L2 GWAS-associated T2DM gene pediatric adult CF population compare insulin secretory capacity , β-cell sensitivity glucose , incretin secretion non-diabetic CF subject high low-risk allele . Phase 1 include 350 subject ( Children age &gt; = 2 year , adolescent , adult ) TCF7L2 genotype ten GWAS-implicated T2DM gene . The distribution TCF7L2 GWAS-implicated T2 DM gene across spectrum glucose abnormality describe . Phase 1 require single blood sample review medical record . Phase 2 include subset 30 non-diabetic child ( age &gt; 8 ) adult insulin incretin secretion study perform look body secrete insulin hormone relation `` diabetes '' gene . These study include Glucose Potentiated Arginine Tests ( GPA , measure β-cell secretory capacity sensitivity glucose ) Mixed Meal Tolerance Test ( MMTT , measure incretin insulin secretion ) .</detailed_description>
