	<detailed_description>In Italy , nation-wide observational study endorse Superior Institute Health previously launch order evaluate appropriateness effectiveness aortic valve replacement ( AVR ) transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI ) procedure : OBservational Study Effectiveness AVR-TAVI procedure severe Aortic steNosis Treatment ( OBSERVANT ) . The present study design complement national survey TAVI AVR procedures include data cost , cognitive function quality life procedure . This integrated framework may help define relevance baseline psychological , emotional cognitive factor outcomes associate different treatment modality , hand , enable accurate evaluation impact kind treatment quality life neuropsychological function . These element could also represent relevant key decision-making different therapeutic strategy . In addition , aim ascertain cost associate mentioned strategy treatment , include cost index hospitalization follow-up cost . Costs estimate , combine integrated physical mental health status outcome treatment modality , may represent background subsequent cost-effectiveness analysis . All consecutive patient undergo transcatheter aortic valve implantation aortic valve replacement ( age ≥ 80 year Logistic Euroscore ≥ 15 % ) aortic stenosis participate center period enrollment include registry , release write informed consent . Allocation patient different treatment group perform jointly cardiologist cardiac surgeon basis complete clinical framework , independently present study accordance available guideline . Type treatment ( example , access site TAVI , type prosthesis… ) decide physician base local clinical practice general principle good clinical practice . The administration neurocognitive quality life questionnaire perform procedure 3 month 1 year train personnel follow standard operation procedure define coordinate unit . A telephone web-based support operator available throughout entire duration study . A common methodology data collection analysis define guarantee data reliability homogeneity assessment among participate unit . The cost analysis coordinate Regional Healthcare Social Agency Emilia Romagna Region . Data collect web-based database ( OBSERVANT ) dedicate Case Records Forms final database build merge database separate database cost Hospital Discharge Records Mortality Registry databases .</detailed_description>
