	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether obstructive sleep apnea affect sleep dependent memory learning . Subjects apnea give test perceptual skill learn ( Visual Discrimination Task ( VDT ) ) previously show depend sleep . Subjects test task sleep . The difference performance sleep compare sleep provide measure sleep dependent learning . Participants test one night less apnea use continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) prescribe physician , well know reduce apnea ; another night native state great degree apnea . Memory performance compare two night determine apnea affect sleep dependent memory .</brief_summary>
