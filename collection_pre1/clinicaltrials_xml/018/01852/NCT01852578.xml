	<brief_title>Cabazitaxel Relapsed Metastatic NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non small cell lung cancer represent second common type cancer men woman Western world . The availability new active regimen first line set prompt several investigator consider second line therapy patient advance NSCLC , since substantial percentage patient maintain good PS upon recurrence . On basis result phase III trial docetaxel , erlotinib , gefitinib , pemetrexed consider `` standard '' choice second-line therapy . However , despite increased availability different drug , NSCLC remain devastate disease median OS rarely exceed 12 month . Preclinical data cabazitaxel demonstrate antitumor activity model resistant paclitaxel docetaxel . In cell line resistant cytotoxic agent , cabazitaxel induce tumor regression . The recommended phase 2 dos Cabazitaxle 20 25 mg/m2 . Cabazitaxel show antitumor activity solid tumor include docetaxel-refractory metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer breast cancer .</detailed_description>
