	<brief_title>Thoracic Endovascular Repair Versus Open Surgery Blunt Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Blunt aortic injury ( BAI ) responsible 16 % traffic fatality . Historically , 80 % death occur scene 20 % transported hospital . With development system trauma care advance , likely patient BAI arrive alive trauma center . Patients BAI arrive hospital treat either classic open surgery endovascular technique . A relatively new endovascular technique , thoracic endovascular repair ( TEVAR ) , recommend Society Vascular Surgery ( SVS ) procedure choice BAI . However , data base describe `` low quality evidence '' ( Grade 2 , C ) , i.e. , good expert opinion . It important note committee responsible recommendation SVS consist vascular surgeon , without input trauma surgeon primarily responsible management trauma patient BAI . This omission may bias literature review favor TEVAR inadequate data publish research account disparities injury severity physiologic compromise , significantly impact outcome . The investigator review recent literature management BAI determine sufficient data exist perform `` apple apple '' comparison TEVAR classic open surgery . The investigator believe sufficient clinical equipoise reach prospective , randomized clinical trial could undertake . Therefore , investigator aim conduct multicenter 5-year combined historical cohort concurrent cohort observational study short-term long-term outcome BAI . Such study would answer follow clinically relevant question patient suffer BAI : 1 . What clinical variable affect short-term mortality neurologic outcome ? 2 . What long-term treatment-associated complication open repair TEVAR ? 3 . In patient similar injury physiologic profile , survival advantage result type operative treatment ? The propose study do Scripps Mercy Hospital Trauma Service participation interested member trauma center Multicenter Trials Group Western Trauma Association .</detailed_description>
