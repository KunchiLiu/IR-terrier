	<detailed_description>Dual antiplatelet therapy consist aspirin clopidogrel cornerstone treatment prevention atherothrombotic event patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) undergo percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . Many patient dual antiplatelet therapy setting may affect thromboembolic condition , particular atrial fibrillation , therefore indication also receive oral anticoagulation stroke prevention . Thus , considerable percentage patient `` triple therapy '' consist aspirin plus clopidogrel plus oral anticoagulant . Although combination therapy allow reduction atherothrombotic thromboembolic event , patient triple therapy increase risk bleeding complication . Dabigatran , synthetic , reversible direct thrombin inhibitor , study alternative warfarin patient atrial fibrillation show least efficacious favorable safety profile . In particular , dabigatran dose 110 mg associate rate stroke systemic embolism similar warfarin , low rate major hemorrhage , dose 150 mg associate lower thrombotic event similar rate bleed event . These finding lead Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve dabigatran use atrial fibrillation patient December 2011 also implement practice guideline superior strategy warfarin . However , FDA approve 150mg formulation . Dabigatran high affinity specificity target serine protease thrombin , one small study show dabigatran produce potent inhibition thrombin-induced platelet aggregation vitro . However , study assess ex vivo pharmacodynamic effect dabigatran patient dual antiplatelet therapy . The ever raise population CAD warrant triple therapy grow number patient treat dabigatran underscore importance understanding pharmacodynamic effect treatment regimen .</detailed_description>
