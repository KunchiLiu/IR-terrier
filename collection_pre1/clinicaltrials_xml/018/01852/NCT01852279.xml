	<brief_title>BCI FES Hand Therapy Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Injuries higher level spinal cord , call tetraplegia , result complete partial paralysis leg arm , make person dependent caregiver elementary activity daily live ( ADL ) drink feeding . About 60 % tetraplegics incomplete injury partially recover movement sensation . The success recovery greatly depend therapy within first year injury . Functional electrical stimulation ( FES ) relatively novel therapy hand . In FES therapy electrode attach surface patient 's forearm electrical current deliver . A disadvantage current FES therapy therapist switch stimulator patient use either hand . In previous pilot study perform two acute tetraplegic patient test feasibility use brain-computer interface ( BCI ) control FES patient 's . BCI base record patient 's brain activity . BCI detect patient 's intention move hand even able physically move . Using BCI , patient control FES think move hand . A BCI-FES therapy provide simultaneous train neural pathway brain hand muscle ( motor imagination/attempt ) muscle brain ( electrical stimulation muscle ) . This form therapy could promote faster complete recovery In controlled study aim provide BCI-FES therapy chronic subacute tetraplegic patient period 20 session access functional neurological outcome therapy . Five chronic patient ( year injury ) participate cross-over study expect recover spontaneously without BCI-FES . Subacute patient receive conventional therapy BCI-FES recovery cause either two therapy . Therefore necessary treatment control group . Each group 10 patient , age injury match . Both group receive amount electrical stimulation treatment group voluntarily control electrical stimulator use BCI . A control group receive passive electrical stimulation hand muscle without use BCI .</detailed_description>
