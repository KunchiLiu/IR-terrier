	<detailed_description>Based multi-source interference task , subject ' cognitive function assess base reaction time , reaction variability , accuracy performance attention control task . This study aim recruit 120 total healthy participant . Overall Safety Plan Subject Protections Safety Monitoring 1 . Confidentiality record assure assign subject research number store computer file without reference name , except single link file link subject 's name research number . Paper record keep lock file drawer lock room , authorize research personnel access . When study complete , link file link subject 's name research number permanently destroy . 2 . Furthermore , upon event subject 's participation terminate , information collect prior subject remove study , destroy . 3 . Personnel involve study acutely sensitive people 's unease reveal personal information . Research personnel also take required Program Education Evaluation Responsible Research Scholarship certification , take utmost precaution protect confidentiality . When potential subject voice lack interest participating , identify information destroyed . During study , subject remind answer question make feel uncomfortable . Data Safety Monitoring Plan 1 . No subject recruit run protocol receive full review approval Medical IRB University Michigan . A clinical research associate accompany subject throughout study . Any minor anxiety arise course procedure immediately assess , typically manage reassurance simple relaxation technique . Assessment always include evaluation subject 's ability continue protocol . 2 . All subject fully inform possible side-effects could encounter study . Every measure take protect subject even rarest possible side effect . Principal Investigator , Dr. Chandra Sripada , extensive prior experience methylphenidate challenge utilize study . 3 . Subjects encourage contact investigator notice symptom untoward side effect . All subject direct access phone number pager study coordinator responsible physician ( Dr. Sripada ) , well 24-hour contact number ( emergency room service ) . This information include copy consent form provide subject . ii . Reporting adverse event Adverse event ( AEs ) record tracked project . Adverse event report per IRBs , FDA , NIH guideline . An adverse event experience take place course research project , , opinion investigator , harmful subject participate research , increase risk harm research , unfavorable impact risk/benefit ratio . Adverse event grade use mild , moderate , severe terminology define : - Mild - Noticeable subject , interfere subject 's daily activity , usually require additional therapy , dose reduction , discontinuation study . - Moderate - Interferes subject 's daily activity , possibly require additional therapy , require discontinuation study . - Severe - Severely limit subject 's daily activity may require discontinuation study . This would include adverse event define `` Serious '' IRBMED . The PI assign attribution definitely associate , probably associate , possibly associate , unrelated . Adverse event also record expect unexpected . All Serious AEs and/or unexpected AEs report IRB , NIH , FDA , within 7 day occurrence recognition . Fatal life-threatening adverse event report institution within 24 hour . Regular annual review protocol activity adverse event submit IRBs NIH . Other less serious expect AEs also report institution compliance requirement . iii . Persons responsible Chandra Sekhar Sripada Project Coordinator Christina Bohensky responsible oversee data integrity , safety monitoring , report adverse event . During phone conference semi -annual meeting adverse event , recruitment , data quality integrity compliance protocol discuss well . VI . Data Analysis Regression analysis utilized ass whether dependent measure task ( accuracy , reaction time ) significantly correlate measure trait impulsivity derive Barratt Impulsivity Scale-11 questionnaire . Independent sample t-tests use determine whether task performance differs due methylphenidate versus placebo administration .</detailed_description>
