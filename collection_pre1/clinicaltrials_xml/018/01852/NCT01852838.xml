	<detailed_description>The Contribution induce Glycolysis Exhaled Volatile Organic Compounds ' ( VOCs ) Signature Lung Cancer Abstract : Lung cancer infamous cruel mortality rate lethal cancer men woman . Unfortunately , lung cancer detect diagnosed advanced stage complicates treatment option . Therefore , dire , unmet need develop effective , highly sensitive , highly specific non-invasive screening method . The solution problem may find volatile organic compound ( VOCs ) organic molecule identify exhaled breath . These VOCs differ individual suffer lung cancer healthy individual . Seeing increased glycolysis one characteristic pattern malignancy , purpose study determine contribution induce glycolysis exhale VOCs . Therefore , study compare exhale breath sample individual suffer lung cancer glucose challenge test . This study aim well understand mechanism involve order identify distinguish VOCs . This may aid develop necessary diagnostic mean lung cancer screening . 1 . Introduction : Lung cancer moth lethal cancer men woman . [ 1 ] There two main class lung cancer : first , Small Cell Lung Cancer ( SCLC ) often refer Oat Cell Cancer , second Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) , constitute majority case lung cancer . [ 2 ] Unfortunately , lung cancer detection diagnosis perform cancer advance , metastatic stage surgery viable treatment option . [ 3 ] Thus , detection diagnosis early stage may significantly improve five year survival rate well provide possibility cure . An effective , non-invasive lung cancer screen method distinguish biological marker find high-risk group yet develop . Lately , researcher begin consider Volatile Organic Compounds ' ( VOCs ) templates possible mean early detection . These VOCs retrieve isolate exhaled breath sample . The VOCs reflect unique metabolic biochemical activity malignant cell . This association proven several researcher well group [ 4 ] show VOCs distinguish healthy affected individual , even discern SCLC NSCLC . [ 5 , 6 ] The current research focus detection , identification characterization unique biological marker find exhaled breath suffer lung cancer . Amongst VOCs detect , research specifically focus VOCs hold potential incorporated effective , non-invasive screening method lung cancer . Carcinogenesis process bound somatic evolution . One popular evolutionary advantage find malignant , metastatic cell increase uptake glucose process glycolysis . This glycolysis process unique malignant cell pronounce anaerobic condition , whereas healthy cell often perform glycolysis aerobic condition . Anaerobic glycolysis- process conversion glucose lactic acid presence oxygen- also know `` Warburg Effect '' Otto Warburg discover characteristic . [ 7 ] Thus , distinguish process find malignant cell exceed rate substance exchange increase glucose degradation ( Warburg Effect ) . These process release organic compound , release exhale breath . Therefore , research examine relationship glucose challenge test effect pattern VOCs exhale breath . 2 . Research Goals : The template organic particle exhale breath discriminates individual suffer active lung cancer individual consider healthy . The purpose study examine contribution process glycolysis unique template . Being process glycolysis accelerate malignant cell , hypothesize glucose challenge test express VOC individual suffer disease . These finding contribute development diagnostic tool lung cancer . 3 . Hypothesis : We hypothesize Warburg Effect essential component creation VOCs unique lung cancer , therefore , glucose challenge test increase production VOCs . These marker hold potential create effective , non-invasive screening method improve sensitivity specificity . 4 . Methods : 4.1 Research Design : This research observational case-control study assess comparison VOCs sample obtain exhaled breath sample blood test take glucose challenge test . The glucose challenge test involve drink solution contain 75 gram glucose wait period 90 minute collection exhale breath blood sample . There need fast six hour test . In addition , clinical assessment perform base medical anamnesis exist , current medical information . 4.2 Study Population : The goal research determine process glycolysis contribute unique VOC pattern exhale breath affect lung cancer . The participant choose individual currently treat pulmonology clinic various reason . The control group include participant identify high-risk individual lung cancer , whereas study group include participant suffer active lung cancer yet begin form medical treatment . The recruitment process perform two consecutive stage . In first stage , twenty patient study group compare twenty participant control group . At point , preliminary assessment data perform find difference VOCs two group . Only event difference find research go second stage , 30 participant recruit test study group . The control group previously mention include 20 participant lung cancer , similar research group term age , gender , medical history , history smoking . This classification perform base self-report survey complete participant . Exclusion criterion study population follow : 1 . Patients uninterested participant and/or unable sign consent form 2 . Lung Cancer patient begin treatment prior research 3 . Patients unable complete research and/or follow visit 4 . Individuals suffer diabetes 4.3 Research Variables : The main variable use test hypothesis follow : - Epidemiological variable participant - Quantitative data define malignant cell ( TMN , size tumor , number metastasis location ) - The glucose level ( via dipstick ) glucose challenge test ( require fast 6 hour prior test ) - The VOCs pattern obtain exhale breath sample characterization molecule via GCMS method . 4.4 Research Methods : Medical Anamnesis : A collection detail patient 's medical history obtain . Information gender , age , medical history , consumption tobacco family history note . In addition , information quantifies qualify malignant cell ( present ) collect record . This include detail type tumor well place , volume , histological characteristic image result . Some medical information obtain pre-existing updated medical record . Exhaled Breath Test : Each participant undergo exhale breath test glucose challenge test lay period 90 minute test . The detailed explanation regard process collection exhale breath sample : The patient exhale 3 breath ( 750 ml exhale breath ) appropriate Mylar bag sterile area technology ensure exhale breath isolate unaffected external environment . The content Mylar bag store TENAX sample preserve sample period six month . The sample undergo additional analysis Israel Institute Technology ( Technion ) auspices Professor Haim Hussam . Each sample analyzed purpose identify VOCs via GC-MS method . The sample undergo additional processing SPME ( pre-concentration solid-phase micro extraction ) . The SPME transfer GC-MS . The GC-MS method allow identification compound short period time via use chromatographic spectroscopic instrument . The spectroscopic instrument undergo additional analysis via AOS instrument . The AOS include detector conjugate nano-particles gold . Each detector identifies wide variety VOCs accordance location concentration cause varying level resistance . This response record undergo statistical analysis via PCA focus specific VOC pattern find sample . The detailed explanation process glucose challenge test follow : The participant request drink sugary solution ( 273 ml ) constitute 75 gram glucose water . The test require participant fast period 6 hour test . After drink solution , participant must wait lay period 90 minute retest exhale breath . In addition , level glucose test dipstick drinking solution , 90 minute lay period . 4.5 Statistical Analysis : The sample size 70 person ( 40 person first stage , additional 30 participant second stage explain ) . The expectation significant difference VOC template glucose challenge test . The estimated difference effect around 30 % , assumption sample error stand around 10 % confidence interval 95 % . The number necessary participant need order achieve result statistical significance size effect range approximately 20-25 person . The information AOS record change resistance analyze via PCA focus specific VOC pattern change obtain sample . The remain variable measure quantitatively present average correspond standard deviation . Those variable obtain quantitatively present percentage . Statistical analysis significance perform follow statistical test : Student 's T Test , Chi-Square , Analysis Variance ( ANOVA ) , Kruskal-Wallis test . All statistical test perform SPSS computer program .</detailed_description>
