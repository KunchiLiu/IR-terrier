	<brief_summary>Primary Endpoint : The primary objective show AIS patient , ineligible refractory treatment IV-tPA , appropriate image selection , treat mechanical thrombectomy within 6-12 hour symptom onset less stroke related disability improve good functional outcome compare treated best MT respect endpoint define : • 90-day global disability assess via modify Rankin score ( mRS ) , analyze use raw mRS score . Statistical detail find section 7.2 . Secondary Endpoints : - 90-day global disability 6-12 hr cohort assess via overall distribution mRS - Proportion patient good functional recovery 6-12 hr cohort define mRS 0-2 90 day - Mortality 30 90 day - Intracranial hemorrhage neurological deterioration ( NIHSS worsen &gt; 4 ) within 24 hour randomization - Procedure relate serious adverse event ( SAE 's ) - Arterial revascularization measure TICI 2b 3 follow device use</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Intravenous ( IV ) tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) administration show safe effective treatment AIS within 3 hour symptom onset , new evidence show potential benefit 4.5 hour . Mechanical thrombectomy AIS patient show clinical trial safe 8 hour symptom onset . The rapid progression thrombectomy device last several year result fast recanalization time maintain high degree safety . This result improved patient outcome , similar prior randomize trial data show improved outcome medical therapy earlier device . Data MERCI trial suggest patient &gt; 85 well baseline NIHSS score &gt; 30 unlikely benefit thrombectomy . Patients rapidly improve neurologic deficit likely excellent recovery conventional care , preclude ability detect beneficial treatment effect thrombectomy . Pilot data incorporate physiologic image show appropriate patient select thrombectomy . This selection methodology show ability maintain level safety efficacy patient treat highly selective environment clinical trial , despite present far beyond accepted time base standard . Vertebrobasilar occlusion patient exclude maintain homogenous study population , particularly since data currently available address comparability image penumbral pattern anterior vs. posterior circulation . This also show reproducible multiple center different image modality . However , prospective interventional stroke study perform date restrict 8-hour time window .</detailed_description>
