	<detailed_description>Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) chronic inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) unknown etiology characterize diffuse mucosal inflammation limit colon . The basis medical treatment agent reduce inflammatory process . Tailoring appropriate therapy depend disease severity , difficult identify . A response therapy may also require month determine . Medications induction remission and/or maintenance patient mild severe UC include 5-aminosalicylates ( 5'ASA ) , corticosteroid , azathioprine ( AZA ) , cyclosporine , infliximab ( IFX ) . All medication inherent side effect profile . Cost major issue medication IFX , tens thousand dollar annually . Medical management still fail severe disease necessitate surgical management colectomy . Identification high-risk patient candidate intensive therapy early disease course might strategy improve treatment outcome limit cost . This notion `` individualizing '' therapy attractive distinct departure current `` step-care '' paradigm treatment add sequentially basis symptom-defined treatment failure . However , paradigm implementable objective mean accurately stratify risk must identify validate . Accordingly , increase interest evolve use biomarkers prognostic tool . Although fecal calprotectin serum CRP potential candidate role , test limitation . Transabdominal ultrasound ( US ) use diagnostic workup IBD . US good surrogate disease activity compare colonoscopy , unable reliably assess rectal wall tend cause symptom UC . Endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) highly accurate diagnostic modality assessment rectal pathology . However , role EUS IBD well define . Tsuga et al show total wall thickness highly predictive acute inflammation patient UC compare healthy control degree rectal wall involvement correlate endoscopic severity . Higaki et al show patient quiescent UC relapse initial sonographic evidence `` deep '' disease activity show significantly great baseline thickness first 3 layer rectal wall . Yoshizawa et al subsequently demonstrate inflammation reach muscularis propria deeper predict need colectomy . Hurlstone et al correlated EUS score histopathology , endoscopic , clinical score find good concordance exist superficial EUS score . In study investigator perform EUS analysis knowledge endoscopy score . This question validity result due potential bias . Another parameter show promise evaluation inflammatory burden EUS evaluation blood flow . Surprisingly , Doppler flow use assess bowel wall vascularity UC EUS . We believe assessment vascularity potential differentiate high degree accuracy active quiescent disease . Although exist literature indicate EUS potential evaluative prognostic tool investigator believe great deal additional research need develop technology . This study correlate Doppler EUS EUS index validate clinical , endoscopic , histological index UC inflammation ass utility diagnostic tool . It assess reproducibility index calculate inter intra-observer agreement blind expert reviewer . This information may prognostic importance might ultimately use guide therapy individual patient .</detailed_description>
