	<brief_summary>The investigator previously show intact protein cod filet improve glucose homeostasis serum lipid profile overweight adult . A large amount trimming various fish specie cod throw away sell low price animal feed , analyse amino acid composition reveals good protein source human . Two fraction normally isolate intact fish meal , i.e . water soluble non-water soluble protein . In present study investigator compare fraction , study effect glucose homeostasis inflammatory marker overweight/obese adult .</brief_summary>
