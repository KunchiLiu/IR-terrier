	<brief_summary>Currently , three radiotracers , ( 2- [ 18F ] FA , 6- [ 18F ] FA [ 18F ] AZAN ) , available study α4β2-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( α4β2-nAChR ) human brain use PET imaging . A crucial problem 2- [ 18F ] FA , 6- [ 18F ] FA ( [ 18F ] AZAN low bind potential ( BP ) extrathalamic ( ET ) region , include hippocampus , cortex caudate lower receptor density thalamus . The importance image ET-α4β2-nAChRs ( ET-nAChR ) emerge post-mortem demonstration alter density ET-nAChRs ( thalamic nAChR ) neurodegenerative disease schizophrenia . PET image ET-nAChR may prove useful detect early change follow functional deterioration neurodegenerative diseases Alzheimers disease . Furthermore , PET image ET-nAChR may allow investigation development new therapy act acetylcholine system . The image drawback presently available nAChR radioligands initiate development radioligands great bind potential several research group . The available pre-clinical data new radioligand [ 18F ] ( - ) -JHU86428 ( [ 18F ] XTRA ) suggest radioligand superior 2- [ 18F ] FA quantitative PET image α4β2-nAChR ( Gao , J. Med . Chem , 2008 ) . In baboon PET study [ 18F ] XTRA exhibit 200 % great brain uptake , 300 % high BPs reach steady-state approximately 1.5 h cortical region post-bolus administration versus 6-8 h 2- [ 18F ] FA . In vitro binding assay show great bind affinity XTRA similar nAChR-subtype selectivity comparison 2-FA . Both ligands bind selectively β2-subtypes predominant nAChR subtypes mammal brain display little binding affinity ganglionic α3β4-nAChR . The current planned human protocol conduct ( 1 ) determine brain distribution ( brain uptake ) test reproducibility ( test-retest design ) [ 18F ] XTRA brain PET scan validation radioligand ; ( 2 ) generate estimate whole body internal organ radiation absorb dose exposure single iv administration [ 18F ] XTRA healthy human subject ; ( 3 ) determine brain distribution [ 18F ] XTRA patient Alzheimer 's disease .</brief_summary>
