	<brief_title>A Safety Study NNZ-2566 Patients With Fragile X Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fragile X Syndrome genetically determine neurological disorder affect individual intellectually handicap vary degree display variety associate psychiatric symptom . Clinically , Fragile X Syndrome characterize intellectual handicap , hyperactivity attentional problem , autism spectrum symptom , emotional lability epilepsy . The epilepsy see Fragile X Syndrome commonly present childhood , gradually remit towards adulthood . Physical feature prominent ear jaw , hyper-extensibility joint frequently present diagnostic . Intellectual handicap common feature define phenotype . Treatment disorder symptomatic - focus management symptom - supportive , require multidisciplinary approach . This study investigate safety tolerability treatment oral administration NNZ-2566 35 mg/kg 70 mg/kg BID adolescent adult male Fragile X Syndrome . The study also also investigate measure efficacy treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Fragile X Syndrome molecular genetic confirmation full FMR1 mutation . Results previously complete test acceptable write documentation genetic result . Results PCR Southern blot test acceptable Results cytogenetic test acceptable subject may eligible molecular genetic test redone . A full mutation mosaicism allow : Subject manifest full phenotypic profile Fragile X syndrome CGG Repeats &gt; 200 detected Southern blot prevail PCR , Southern blot show &gt; 200 repeat PCR result show &lt; 200 repeat . The following result would meet criterion : Deletions Point mutation Mosaicism without detection &gt; 200 CGG repeat absence full phenotypic profile individual mosaicism 2 . Males , age 1245 year 3 . Subjects Clinical Global Impression Severity ( CGIS ) score 4 great Screening 4 . Subjects total score 30 great Aberrant Behavior Checklist ( ABC ) Screening . 5 . Current treatment 3 psychotropic medication . This include medication use treat problem sleep onset sleep continuity . Melatonin difficulty sleep onset permissible excepted count psychotropic medication . Similarly , antiepileptic medication permit denoted `` psychotropic medication '' use treatment seizure . Use antiepileptics indication treatment mood disorder count towards limit permit medication . Concurrent use omega3 fatty acid also permissible count towards allow number concomitant psychotropic medication . A complete list permit concomitant psychotropic medication find Appendix A . 6 . Concomitant medication chronic medical condition permissible . Examples chronic medical condition include gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) asthma . Every effort make keep dos dose regimen medication stable 4 week precede Screening period Screening commencement study medication . 1 . Permitted psychotropic concomitant medication ( except antiepileptic medicationssee ) must stable , term dose dose regimen , least 4 week prior Screening must remain stable period Screening commencement study medication . 2 . Antiepileptic medication must stable dose dose regimen 12 week prior Screening must remain stable period Screening commencement study medication 7 . Behavioral treatment exclude psychotherapy ( see exclusion criterion ) must stable 4 week prior Screening must remain stable period Screening commencement study medication . For enrollee , every effort make maintain stable regimen allow concomitant medication allow behavioral therapy time commencement singleblind study medication last study assessment . 8 . Sufficient expressive language capability complete Expressive Language Sampling Task . 9 . Individuals history seizures stable pattern seizure activity 3 month precede Screening . 1 . Treatment within two week prior Screening monoamine ( MAO ) inhibitor , lithium , minocycline , acamprosate , racemic baclofen , investigational metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 ( mGluR5 ) medication , dcycloserine , oxytocin , carbetocin , tricyclic antidepressant bupropion . 2 . Patients plan commence psychotherapy , include cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT ) , period study begin psychotherapy , include CBT , within 6 week prior Screening . 3 . History , current , cardiovascular , renal , hepatic , respiratory and/or gastrointestinal disease , may interfere absorption , distribution , metabolism excretion study medication , may interfere interpretation safety/tolerability efficacy study medication . 4 . History , current cerebrovascular disease clinically significant brain trauma . 5 . History , current clinically significant endocrine disorder , e.g . hypo hyperthyroidism , diabetes . 6 . History , current malignancy . 7 . Current major depressive disorder ( patient free recent episode 3 month prior enrollment ) . 8 . History DSM5defined substance use disorder 3 month prior Screening . 9 . Clinically significant abnormality safety laboratory test , vital sign ECG , measure Screening . 10 . QT/QTcF Exclusions ( follow ) : QTcF &gt; 450 msec . Three ECGs obtain time Screening , 5 minute apart , result average . History risk factor torsade de pointes ( e.g . heart failure , clinically significant hypokalemia hypomagnesemia , family long QT syndrome ) . A serum potassium screen &lt; 3.0 mmol/L . QT/QTcF prolongation previously currently control medication , normal QT/QTcF interval could achieve medication Current treatment medication demonstrate QT/QTc prolongation risk describe Warnings Precautions section Prescribing Information 11 . Patients significant hear and/or visual impairment may affect ability complete test procedure . 12 . Current treatment insulin 13 . Hgb A1C value outside normal reference range Screening 14 .
