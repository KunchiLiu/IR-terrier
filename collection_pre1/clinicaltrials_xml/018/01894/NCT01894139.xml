	<detailed_description>Overweight excessive gestational weight gain ( GWG ) associate increase risk high birth weight ; furthermore increase risk child develop overweight , diabetes metabolic disease childhood adulthood . The effect reduce gestational weight gain supply optimized amount source nutrients well investigated . Increased knowledge possibility efficacy prevent overweight relate disease necessary . Modification protein source increase ratio protein relation amount carbohydrate reduction glycaemic index ( GI ) observational study individually link improved fetal body composition , metabolism weight control later life , less weight gain weight retention mother . The overall aim APPROACH investigate optimal diet pregnancy influence program offspring . This study increase knowledge effect specific nutrient composition weight retention pregnancy growth development foetal stage nine year age , risk marker later metabolic disease , especially diabetes metabolic syndrome . APPROACH dietary intervention investigate difference respond high-protein , especially marine dairy protein low-GI diet versus diet accord Nordic Nutritional Recommendations . All visit assessment perform trained staff Copenhagen University Hospital Herlev . Subjects woman expect delivery Department Gynaecology Obstetrics examination gestational development foetal growth take place ; assessment child perform Department Paediatrics . A total 390 obese ( body mass index ( BMI ) â‰¥ 30 kg/m2 ) pregnant woman randomize intervention control engage program late first trimester early second trimester birth . After birth child include prospective cohort accord maternal randomization examine six time delivery age nine year . APPROACH increase knowledge effect nutrient composition high protein carbohydrate ratio weight retention pregnancy growth development foetal stage nine year age , risk marker later metabolic disease , especially diabetes metabolic syndrome . Plasma lipid , marker metabolic disease , epigenetics vitamin D status assess baseline several time pregnancy ; intervention control group data increase knowledge effect supplement marine oil vitamin D pregnant woman .
