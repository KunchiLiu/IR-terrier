Previous concurrent malignancy . Exceptions : adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer ; situ carcinoma cervix , treat curatively without evidence recurrence least 3 year prior study entry ; solid tumor treat curatively , without evidence recurrence least 3 year prior study entry . Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman , pregnancy define state female conception termination gestation , confirm positive hCG laboratory test ( &gt; 5 mIU/mL ) . Women childbearing potential , defined woman physiologically capable become pregnant , allow participate study UNLESS use highly effective method contraception throughout study 3 month study drug discontinuation . Highly effective contraception method include : Total abstinence Male female sterilization Combination two follow ( a+b a+c b+c ) 1 . Use oral , injected , implanted hormonal method contraception 2 . Placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) 3 . Barrier method contraception : condom occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal suppository Postmenopausal woman allow participate study . Women consider postmenopausal child bear potential 12 month natural ( spontaneous ) amenorrhea appropriate clinical profile ( e.g . age appropriate , history vasomotor symptom ) six month spontaneous amenorrhea serum FollicleStimulating Hormone ( FSH ) level &gt; 40 mIU/mL surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week prior screen . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment consider child bear potential . Sexually active male must use condom intercourse take drug 5 T1/2 stop treatment father child period . A condom require use also vasectomize men order prevent delivery drug via seminal fluid .
