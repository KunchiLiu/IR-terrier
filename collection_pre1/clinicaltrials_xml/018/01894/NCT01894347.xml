	<brief_summary>Multi-Drug resistant pathogen ( MDR ) report worldwide increase incidence , especially intensive care setting . One drug effective MDRs , colistin ( polymyxin E ) . This agent reintroduce response increase MDR pathogen might use often future . Data safety regard important side effect sufficiently available . l This study evaluate toxicity patient receive aerosolize colistin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Observational Pilot-study Evaluation Nephro- Neurotoxicity Anti-infectious Therapy With Inhalative Colistin Therapy Patients With Ventilator-associated Pneumonia ( VAP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There grow evidence patient ICU set special risk profile consecutive colonization possible infection due MDR pathogen . One therapy option use inhalative colistin , agent demonstrate effective pathogen . Data pharmacodynamics - kinetics transfer old study patient population . For patient pulmonary colonization infection due MDR pathogen systemic resorption drug know , consequently systemic side effect include kidney neural damage predictable . This study focus patient inhalative colistin therapy use therapeutic drug monitor determine rate systemic resorption colistin . For evaluation neurotoxicity function peripheral nerve ( neve conduction velocity ) eighth cranial nerve monitor . Nephrotoxicity estimate creatinine level ( -clearance ) RIFLE criterion .</detailed_description>
