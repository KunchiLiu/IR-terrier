	<brief_summary>NovoTTF-100A device Bevacizumab study drug approve FDA ( Food Drug Administration ) use monotherapy treat glioblastoma multiforme . The NovoTTF-l00A portable battery operate device produce TTFields within human body use surface electrode ( transducer array ) . Intermediate frequency electric field ( TTFields ) stunt growth tumor cell . The purpose study determine efficacy combination Bevacizumab NovoTTF-100A Bevacizumab naive ( mean never receive bevacizumab ) patient recurrent glioblastoma ( GBM ) measure 6-month progression free survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>NovoTTF-100A With Bevacizumab ( Avastin ) Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label Phase II trial adult recurrent glioblastoma ( GBM ) . The NovoTTF-100A treatment Bevacizumab administer outpatient basis ; NovoTTF-100A treatment initiate outpatient clinic . PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine efficacy combination bevacizumab NovoTTF-100A bevacizumab-naive patient recurrent glioblastoma ( GBM ) measure 6-month progression-free survival ( PFS6 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety tolerability combination bevacizumab Novo-TTF-100A patient population . II . To evaluate overall survival population . III . To determine objective response rate ( ORR ) modify Revised Assessment Neuro-Oncology ( RANO ) criterion population . IV . To assess time-to-progression population . V. To assess neurocognitive function ( NCF ) quality life ( QOL ) population . OUTLINE : Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 15 . Patients also undergo electric field therapy NovoTTF-100A least 18 hour daily . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow least 28 day .</detailed_description>
