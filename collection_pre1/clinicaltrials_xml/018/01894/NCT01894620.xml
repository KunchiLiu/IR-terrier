	<detailed_description>Upon meet inclusion criterion provide informed consent , participant complete series cognitive assessment rTMS treatment TMS Lab Riverview Health Center . Each treatment session involve implement rTMS , patient involve cognitive exercise name object action . The study session schedule follow : Block 1 : 5 days/week two week follow 2 day week 1 week , follow week 1 week ( total 13 treatment ) ; Pause : 4 week treatment ; Block 2 : another 13 session treatment pattern Block 1 . One two set treatment ( Block 1 Block 2 ) sham one real . Sham treatment session identical real treatment session , except magnetic stimulation . Patients randomly assign receive either sham real treatment first . The purpose sham treatment control group data plausible improvement result rTMS compare . By design two set sham-real real-sham treatment session , every participant receive real treatment , also control data . The cognitive assessment do baseline , weekly basis . A subgroup study population recruit investigate second objective : effect rTMS sleep quality . Those patient require sign second consent ; , patient go full-night sleep study Misericordia Health Center time interval cognitive assessment .</detailed_description>
