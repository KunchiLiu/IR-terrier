	<brief_summary>This study aim investigate value dual time point PET/CT lymphoma . Since FDG uptake link glucose metabolism , PET image also use detect suspect sit infectious inflammatory disorder . In clinical setting , challenge distinguish FDG uptake benign malignant lesion give rise considerable quantity false positive result decrease positive predictive value . Performing FDG-PET imaging sixty minute injection common practice stag surveillance lymphoma procedure may optimal , especially settings benign inflammatory lesion clinical concern . In attempt find alternative method discrimination , dual time point FDG-PET introduce . This technique show potentially promising method FDG-PET image distinguish malignant benign lesion use SUV value . The reason different FDG uptake pattern inflammatory malignant lesion unclear . Several factor may contribute phenomenon cellular basis . It show cancer cell exhibit increased number glucose transporter low level glucose-6-phosphatase . Varying level different cancer cell type may explain different FDG uptake curve . Because various cell type exhibit vary rate FDG uptake believe kinetic investigation may prove value understand different type lymphoma identify perform precise image stag surveillance .</brief_summary>
