	<detailed_description>More 33 % U.S. adult age 20 obese ( BMI ≥30 kg/m2 ) , 6 % severely obese ( BMI ≥40 kg/m2 ) . As prevalence severity obesity increase , number woman obesity-related abnormality reproductive function , include anovulation infertility . Specifically , obesity contributes ovulatory problem compromise ovarian response ovulation induction agent clomiphene . Women seek assistance specialist reproductive concern anxious achieve pregnancy highly motivate . We propose assess relative efficacy low energy diet ( VLED ) use liquid meal replacement vs. standard care dietary counseling education ( DCE ) metabolic effect weight reduction obese , subfertile population ass ovulation time conception woman . We hypothesize use low energy diet resultant rapid profound weight loss mark improvement metabolic state , increase rate spontaneous cycling , improve unassisted clomiphene-assisted ovulation significantly improve conception pregnancy rate . Because direct relationship obesity anovulation , test whether evaluation habitual dietary intake plasma metabolomic profile use identify specific dietary component metabolites predict successful unsuccessful induction ovulation pregnancy response weight loss without clomiphene citrate . 32 reproductive age woman BMI ≥35≤45 kg/m2 randomize 12 week VLED DCE ovulation rate time conception group assess 6 month period . We also evaluate group difference rate weight loss , absolute weight lose , BMI , waist hip circumference well reproductive metabolic hormone level . Luteinizing hormone ( LH ) , follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) , androgens , leptin , glucose insulin ( HOMA ) , β-cell function ( Matsuda Index ) . We assess clinical , hormonal , dietary metabolomic profile , predict response weight loss clomiphene citrate improve ovulation . Women assess clinical molecular phenotype , include plasma metabolomic profile . Metabolomic profile adjust chronic dietary intake . An initial assessment level dietary component , metabolites metabolic pathway predict response investigate . We determine program acceptability difference change co-morbid health condition , quality-of-life , psychological well-being standard care VLED-based weight loss participant . Important physiological benefit arise weight loss magnitude change assess group patient seek reproductive assistance . This pilot study provide first information relative success aggressive , short-term weight loss treatment infertility define improvement ovulation conception provide data large , definitive trial approach . The study allow assessment feasibility acceptability translate VLED treatment-based clinical care research develop University Michigan Investigational Weight Management Clinic specialize population seek reproductive assistance . Finally , study provide important preliminary data large trial ass health effect mother offspring result aggressive intervention alter pre-pregnancy metabolic environment reproductive age woman .</detailed_description>
