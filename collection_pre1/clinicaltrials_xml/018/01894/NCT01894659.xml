	<brief_summary>Premature neonate admit neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) require several hundred procedure hospitalization . Many tissue-damaging procedure ( TDPs ) cause pain . Through NIH fund research , make novel observation exposure single TDP significantly increase ATP utilization oxidative stress , evidence increase plasma level hypoxanthine , uric acid malondialdehyde neonate expose TDPs compare control ( TDP ) . Because neonate expose numerous TDPs , relevant explore energy cost repeat exposure painful procedure , important information currently know , effect cumulative metabolic dysfunction could result potentially treatable preventable cell injury . Oral sucrose analgesia frequently give relieve procedural pain neonate basis effect behavioral physiological pain score . However , find , prospective , randomize , double blind study fund NIH , although oral sucrose significantly reduce pain score , administration single TDP ( heel lance ) significantly increase ATP utilization . This evidence high plasma concentration hypoxanthine uric acid neonate give sucrose compare control neonate ( TDP , sucrose ) neonates give pacifier . These novel finding raise concern preterm neonate limit ATP store susceptible cell injury due ATP depletion . In addition , raise relevant concern : If single dose oral sucrose alter ATP metabolism , effect exposure multiple dos oral sucrose ? More importantly , effect multiple TDPs and/or multiple oral sucrose dosage ATP utilization , oxidative stress cell injury ? This application also explore effect 30 % oral glucose , another sweet solution currently use relieve pain , ATP metabolism . In study , test general hypothesis exposure multiple TDPs and/or multiple dose oral sucrose analgesia compare oral glucose standard care , alter biochemical marker ATP utilization , oxidative stress cell injury . We use prospective randomize clinical research design test hypothesis day life 3-7 human premature neonate . Increased ATP utilization quantify concentration hypoxanthine , xanthine uric acid measure use HPLC . Oxidative stress quantify concentration allantoin use gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy , cell injury quantify urinary concentration intestinal fatty acid bind protein , early marker enterocyte injury . Data application provide insight cellular biochemical effect repetitive accumulate TDPs and/or multiple dos oral sucrose . With knowledge , propose test innovative strategy decrease pain also prevent cell injury cell death .</brief_summary>
