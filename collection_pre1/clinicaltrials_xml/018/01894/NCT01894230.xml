	<detailed_description>HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor ( `` statin '' ) commonly prescribe low low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDLc ) prevent cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , lead cause morbidity mortality . Long-term adherence statin primary care environment challenging ; consequence statin non-adherence include high LDLc level , hospitalization , cost , death due CVD . Medication non-adherence complex multifactorial associate number factor include medication cost , complexity medication regimen , poor provider-patient relationship / communication , adverse side effect . For statin , side effect muscle ache , cramp , pain ( refer broadly statin-related myopathy ) frequent cause non-adherence . These symptom non-specific frequent reason stop statin therapy , due patient provider concern possibility statin-related myopathy . Many patient may needlessly deprive cardiovascular benefit long-term statin use . A genetic risk factor statin myopathy subsequent non-adherence recently identify . In genome-wide association study , genetic variant ( name SLCO1B1*5 ) main contributor statin myopathy . It demonstrate SLCO1B1*5 variant predictor myopathy , also premature statin discontinuation . The risk *5 allele statin specific : great simvastatin atorvastatin use , least pravastatin rosuvastatin . Therefore , SLCO1B1*5 variant common , predict myopathy , subsequent non-adherence , due statin-specific effect create novel research paradigm personalizing statins individual 's genetic profile . Carriers SLCO1B1*5 variant may best rosuvastatin , pravastatin , fluvastatin whereas non-carriers may treat statin . The objective study conduct randomize trial compare two strategy : 1. genetically guide statin therapy vs. 2. usual care ( i.e. , strategy without genetics ) effect statin adherence LDLc lowering . The overall hypothesis genetically guide statin therapy lead great statin adherence lower LDLc compare non-guided strategy . The design trial randomize primary care patient within Duke University Health System ( DUHS ) travis Air Force Base ( TAFB ) clinic nonadherent statin due prior side-effects unblinded , 1:1 fashion , stratify SLCO1B1*5 genotype .</detailed_description>
