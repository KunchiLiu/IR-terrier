	<brief_summary>This randomize , parallel-group , open-label , single-dose study belimumab healthy subject estimate relative bioavailability , tolerability safety single dose belimumab 200 milligram ( mg ) self-administered SC healthy subject use prefilled syringe autoinjector . This study also assess usability reliability injection device . A total approximately 80 subject ( 40 per group ) randomly assign 1 1 ratio receive 200 mg belimumab SC single 1.0 milliliter ( mL ) injection liquid formulation ( 200 mg/mL ) Day 0 via assign injection device . Subjects continue follow 70 day administration belimumab .</brief_summary>
