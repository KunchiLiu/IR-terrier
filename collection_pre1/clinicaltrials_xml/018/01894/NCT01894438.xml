	<detailed_description>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) pathologic condition involve hepatic steatosis non alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) , result fat accumulation liver ( liver fat &gt; 5-10 % liver weight ) , due excess alcohol consumption cause steatosis . Its prevalence range general population 10-35 % , obese individual reach 75 % particularly worrying people appear high mortality liver non-liver-related disease , cardiovascular disease , therefore great economic burden health cost . At present , medication surgical procedure approve treat NAFLD lifestyle modification remain cornerstone therapy target weight reduction overweight subject prevention overweight normal weight individual . Given Mediterranean dietary pattern beneficial effect prevention resolution metabolic syndrome , main aim present study implement evaluate potential benefit intervention base Mediterranean lifestyle sample patient NAFLD . A secondary aim produce material , health professional ( namely dietitians doctor ) patient help implement intervention base Mediterranean lifestyle . This study prospective , randomize , blind control study . Participants NAFLD BMI &gt; 25Kg/m2 ( range 25-40 Kg/m2 ) include . NAFLD 's diagnosis base increase serum level alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , without increase gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase ( GGT ) serum level , presence hepatic steatosis absence cause hepatic steatosis hepatic failure . At baseline , patient inform study give write consent . Then subject randomly assign one 3 group : ( ) Control group , receive write general advice healthy lifestyle ; ( b ) Mediterranean diet Group ( c ) Mediterranean lifestyle group . Participants ( b ) ( c ) group attend comprehensive program , comprise seven 60-min group counsel session , conduct every two week first 2 month every month follow 4 month , 6-month evaluation .

All patient pass liver stiffness measurement liver elastography baseline , well end intervention one year study entry . Patients without recent liver biopsy ( within previous 12 month ) also undergo liver biopsy baseline .
