	<brief_title>Statin Therapy Improve Medication Adherence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor ( `` statin '' ) commonly prescribe low low density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDLc ) prevent cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , lead cause morbidity mortality . Long-term adherence statin primary care environment challenging ; consequence statin non-adherence include high LDLc level , hospitalization , cost , death due CVD . Medication non-adherence complex multifactorial associate number factor include medication cost , complexity medication regimen , poor provider-patient relationship / communication , adverse side effect . For statin , side effect muscle ache , cramp , pain ( refer broadly statin-related myopathy ) frequent cause non-adherence . These symptom non-specific frequent reason stop statin therapy , due patient provider concern possibility statin-related myopathy . Many patient may needlessly deprive cardiovascular benefit long-term statin use . A genetic risk factor statin myopathy subsequent non-adherence recently identify . In genome-wide association study , genetic variant ( name SLCO1B1*5 ) main contributor statin myopathy . It demonstrate SLCO1B1*5 variant predictor myopathy , also premature statin discontinuation . The risk *5 allele statin specific : great simvastatin atorvastatin use , least pravastatin rosuvastatin . Therefore , SLCO1B1*5 variant common , predict myopathy , subsequent non-adherence , due statin-specific effect create novel research paradigm personalizing statins individual 's genetic profile . Carriers SLCO1B1*5 variant may best rosuvastatin , pravastatin , fluvastatin whereas non-carriers may treat statin . Specific Aims : Aim 1 : To measure effect genotype-guided statin prescription patient ' concern regard risk statin therapy . Aim 2 : To measure compare effect genotype-guided statin prescription non-guided therapy statin adherence patient currently adherent statin . The approach pilot study recruit 100 Duke University Health System ( DUHS ) patient receive care Duke Primary Care Pickett Road ( DPC ) Center Living ( CFL ) clinic indication statin therapy reduce cardiovascular risk , currently take statin . Consented patient genotyped SLCO1B1*5 allele Duke Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory . Test result return first provider along genotype-specific strategy revise and/or provide new prescription statin therapy next patient along genotype-specific information personal risk side effect certain statin therapy . The primary outcome measure collect use online survey administer patient two time point : 1 ) genetic test 2 ) 4-months testing . Additional survey elements address patient 's demographic , belief concern medication , history prescription drug ( e.g. , side effect general compliance ) overall experience genetic testing study administer well . It possible subject re-experience symptom prior statin-intolerance re-challenged statin part study . By avoid certain type statin ( i.e . simvastatin atorvastatin ) carrier SLCO1B1*5 genetic variant use statin ( i.e . pravastatin rosuvastatin ) placebo control trial increase risk adverse event , risk may less likely . Age- , sex- , diagnosis- , provider-matched concurrent historical control create order compare genetically-guided non-genetically guided therapy</detailed_description>
