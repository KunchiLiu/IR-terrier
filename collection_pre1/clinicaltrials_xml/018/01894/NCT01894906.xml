	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine quantity iron derive SFP transfer dialysate patient single dialysis session . The effect various condition may affect transfer iron blood dialysate flow rate , change bicarbonate delivery , dialyzer membrane type effect reuse also investigate . The absorption removal iron blood also investigate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Quantitative Mass Transfer SFP-iron From Dialysate Blood CKD-HD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- A total 12 subject standard 3X/week hemodialysis study 2 group ( 6 subject per group ) - 2 primary dialyzer membrane study . : - Polyamide Membrane ( Gambro Polyflux series : 17R 21R ) - Cellulose Triacetate ( Baxter CT series : CT-190 ) - Each 1-week treatment cycle include 3 haemodialysis ( HD ) session per subject , include 2 study treatment-HD session 1 non-treatment-HD session per subject . Treatment-HD session conduct midweek end-of-week ( i.e . Dialysis day 3 5 week 1 day interdialytic interval ) avoid excessive fluid shift due increase UF need non-treatment HD session ( conduct begin week ; HD day 1 ) . - Within group , subject randomize 1 6 treatment sequence . The treatment investigate : Control ; new dialyzer , reuse dialyzer , low blood flow/dialysate flow , Low bicarbonate concentration different synthetic dialyzer membrane ( PAES ) - Blood complete serum iron profile time obtain new dialyzer ( SFP/standard bicarbonate/new dialyzer/ high Qb Qd ) subject . This necessitate approximately 24-hour inpatient confinement obtain blood specified time interval dialysis complete . Blood partial iron profile collect dialysis session dialysis session . - Each 6 enrolled subject per dialyzer membrane type assign different sequence treatment help ensure treatment sequence affect analysis ( Note : first dialysis session 3 study week , i.e . HD1 , HD4 HD7 , non-study related session study procedure perform except adverse event collection . - Patients receive follow medication screen end study : - Oral iron preparation , include multivitamin supplement contain iron - Intravenous iron preparation - Doses ESA 's change screen end study .</detailed_description>
