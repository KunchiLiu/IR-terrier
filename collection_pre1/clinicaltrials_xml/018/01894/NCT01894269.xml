	<brief_summary>Although commonly accept antiviral therapy commence hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) treatment patient high viral load elevate ALT total bilirubin value sign cirrhosis , dilemma exists HBV DNA liver function ( ALT , AST , TBIL ) remain low level . Whether antiviral therapy make sense patient sign hepatitis high viral replication remain unclear , especially relatively advanced stage HCC patient receive TACE . Thus , investigator carry prospective control study compare survival patient TACE without antiviral therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemoembolization With Without Antiviral Therapy Unresectable HBV-related HCC With Low HBV DNA Replication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In highly endemic area , hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection play primary role etiology HCC frequently observe HCC patient . Patients HBV-related HCC usually history chronic HBV infection . Chemotherapy malignancy associate HBV reactivation . Furthermore , end stage liver disease due HBV , level HBV replication correlate liver function . For TACE , report HBV reactivation inconsistent . Some study demonstrate HBV reactivation , , others show decreased HBV DNA level . The exact mechanism occur still unknown . Although anti-HBV therapy report suppress HBV reactivation various clinical setting immunosuppressive condition , report concern TACE treatment HBV-related HCC . Also , long-term effect antiviral therapy relatively advanced HCC patient HCC remain unclear . Although commonly accept antiviral therapy commence HCC treatment patient high viral load elevate ALT total bilirubin value sign cirrhosis , dilemma exists HBV DNA liver function ( ALT , AST , TBIL ) remain low level . Therefore , would call establishment clinical practice guideline antiviral therapy HBV-related HCC patient , especially consensus indication administer nucleoside analog ( NAs ) . Thus , purpose investigator ' study prospectively study efficacy nucleoside analog ( NAs ) transcatheter arterial chemoembolization nonresectable hepatocellular carcinoma relatively low HBV DNA replication Child-Pugh grade A base multivariate analysis prognostic factor . The HBV DNA liver function parameter monitor closely . Once reactivation occur control group , antiviral therapy would administer immediately . The study interim analysis allow trial stop significant difference detect . The accumulated data examine half patient enrol clinical trial .</detailed_description>
