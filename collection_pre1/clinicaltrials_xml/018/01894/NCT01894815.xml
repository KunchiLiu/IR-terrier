	<detailed_description>Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) common psychiatric condition , mostly treat antidepressant drug , limited issue refractoriness adverse effect . In context , researcher investigate non-pharmacological treatment know transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) . In prior clinical trial 120 patient MDD , investigator demonstrate combination tDCS sertraline 50mg/day increase , faster effect depressive symptom ( Brunoni et al. , JAMA Psychiatry , 2013 ) . However , although investigator suggest tDCS vs. sertraline similar efficacy , comparison compromise due low sertraline dose also comparison sertraline vs. placebo significant . To prove tDCS similarly effective antidepressant would tremendous impact clinical psychiatry , since tDCS virtually absent adverse effect . Its ease use , portability low price also interest characteristic use primary secondary health care . Thus , aim compare tDCS fully dose , effective antidepressant . The study non-inferiority , randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , three-arm trial compare active tDCS/placebo pill , sham tDCS/escitalopram 20mg/day sham tDCS/placebo pill ten week , randomize 240 patient MDD 3:3:2 ratio ( less placebo ) . Our primary aim show tDCS inferior escitalopram 20mg/day noninferiority margin least 50 % escitalopram-placebo effect . As secondary aim , researcher investigate putative biomarkers tDCS response . This important consider large sample size study also paucity tDCS study - therefore , identification biomarkers could generate new hypothesis future study tDCS ' mechanisms action . The biomarkers : genetic polymorphism ( BDNF , SLC6A4 , THP1 , 5HT2A ) ; serum marker ( BDNF ) ; motor cortical excitability ( cortical silent period , intracortical inhibition , intracortical facilitation ) ; heart rate variability ; neuroimaging ( structural volume dorsolateral prefrontal anterior cingulate cortex , white matter tract prefrontal cortex posterior cingulate cortex connectivity ) . This project represent novel research line Institution , investigator thereby propose onset new center denominate C.I.N.A . ( Interdisciplinary Center Applied Neuromodulation ) foment use development project use neuromodulation technique . This new center also interact center field clinical research , neuroscience neuropsychiatry .</detailed_description>
