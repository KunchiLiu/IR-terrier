	<brief_summary>Deep Vein Thrombosis ( DVT ) life threaten condition serious concern among hospitalized patient , death occur approximately 6 % case . It involve formation clot stagnant blood flow occur , predominantly deep vein leg . Three mechanism underlie DVT , venous stasis ( slow stop blood ) , hypercoagulability ( increased clotting ) damage blood vessel endothelium ( damage blood vessel wall ) , collectively know Virchow 's triad . Intermittent pneumatic compression ( IPC ) neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) show improve low limb blood flow . However , study directly compare two method , use date NMES technique . The objective study compare two method term blood flow , young old population .</brief_summary>

Three mechanism underlie DVT , venous stasis ( slow stop blood ) , hypercoagulability ( increased clotting ) damage blood vessel endothelium ( damage blood vessel wall ) , collectively know Virchow 's triad . Intermittent Pneumatic Compression ( IPC ) involve use inflatable cuff place around limb . This cuff inflate deflates intermittently order squeeze blood underlie vein . Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation ( NMES ) lead contraction muscle deliver series control electrical pulse via skin surface electrode place motor point target muscle .</detailed_description>
