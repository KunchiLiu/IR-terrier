	<brief_summary>The mainstay asthma treatment inhaled steroid ( commonly call 'preventer ' ) keep symptom asthma control . Increasing strengths steroid inhaler may require order gain control asthma , usually guide symptom simple measurement lung function peak flow . The airway ( breathe tube ) lung get small lung go . Most simple measurement lung function reflect large 'central ' airways n't provide information small 'peripheral ' airways.Newer measurement develop give u accurate information small airway working.Indeed small airway seem play significant role asthma term inflammation airway narrow . Recently , new type steroid inhaler develop much small particle size standard inhale steroids.These show go deep lung , thus get small airway . There study suggest might improve asthma control . However , know small airway function show abnormal , whether improves extra-fine particle inhale steroid , whether improve small airway function specifically translate improved asthma control . In study wish study asthmatic patient completely control standard particle size inhaled steroid , addition evidence abnormal small airway function . By want find whether change dose extra-fine particle inhale steroid instead improve asthma control get deep lung improve small airway function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A single centre , open-label , single subject study 12-24 week period . Invited participant receive write 'Participant Information Sheet ' ( PIS ) detail requirement trial extent participation attend screen visit . Participants give least 24 hour read PIS . Prior screen ( subsequent challenge visit ) participant withhold LABAs ( combination inhaler contain LABA ) 48 hour ; salbutamol 6 hour . Verbal consent obtain patient telephone withholding medication prior screen explain way mean consent full study stage . At screen visit member research team discus PIS participant , answer question pose write informed consent obtain witnessed member staff ask consent patient . A general physical examination carry qualified medical practitioner . A pregnancy test perform female patient advice issue male female participant use contraception throughout duration study . The following measured : - Asthma Control Questionnaire - Mini-Asthma Quality Life Questionnaire - Fractional exhale nitric oxide level - Impulse oscillometry - Spirometry - Skin prick test common allergens - Full blood count , renal function , electrolytes , liver enzymes random blood glucose . Participants check inclusion exclusion criterion . Those find eligible proceed step and/or run-in period . This last minimum 4 week . Participants issue pre-labelled container collection overnight urine sample night prior visit V1 write instruction do . A sample collect prior visit V2 V3 well . If potential participant screen receive ≥200µg/day ICS ( BDP ) without additional LABA ACQ &gt; 1.0 directly enter 4 week run-in period . At 2 week run-in period participant contact reassess ACQ score . If ACQ &gt; 1.0 continue run-in period remain 2 week dose ICS . If ACQ &gt; 1.0 ICS dose approximately halve ( reduce minimum 200µg/day great half original ICS dose ) one ( ) second line medication ( e.g . theophylline , LTRA ) discontinue discretion study doctor . They restart 4 week run-in period . If already receive 200µg/day ICS ( i.e . dose reduce ) withdrawn study juncture . At end 4 week period participant still ACQ &gt; 1.0 proceed visit V1 . If potential participant screen receive ≥200µg/day ICS ( BDP ) additional LABA ACQ score &gt; 1.0 , LABA discontinue directly enter 4 week run-in period . If participant receive LABA part combination inhaler , convert equivalent ICS alone inhaler ( i.e . coarse particle ICS ) enter 4 week run-in period . Progress run-in described . If potential participant screen receive ≥200µg/day ICS ( BDP ) additional LABA ACQ &gt; 1.0 , LABA discontinue per 3.6.2 ICS dose approximately halve ( reduce minimum 200µg/day great half original ICS dose ) . For example , Seretide 250µg b.i.d . would convert Flixotide 125µg b.i.d . They subsequently enter 4 week run-in period progress described.. Participants ask perform record twice daily domiciliary PEF complete daily diary reliever use symptom begin step-down/run-in period end study . Participants advise contact investigator feel asthma significantly worsen interim . They also give card 24 hour emergency contact detail . At end 4 week run-in period , participant check inclusion exclusion criterion confirm subject 's suitability receive study drug accord study protocol . Those eligible proceed study visit 1 . Those fulfil study criterion return pre-study medication GP inform medically relevant data . Study visit V1 , V2 V3 Full study visit occur end run-in period ( baseline ) , 4 week 8 week . Participants ask withhold reliever per screen visit . ( LABAs withhold duration study ) . Participants attend unit morning visit day . The overnight urine collection receive participant analysis . Peak flow record review along daily domiciliary symptom reliever use diary . Participants ask complete ACQ Mini-AQLQ . A venous blood sample drawn FBC . A venous blood sample drawn ECP . FeNO , IOS , spirometry perform order . Mannitol bronchial challenge perform Participants convert Qvar ( HFA-beclometasone ) equivalent therapeutic dose original ICS , e.g . Qvar 100µg = Clenil 200µg = Pulmicort 200µg = Flixotide 100µg = Asmanex 100µg . A Qvar 50µg 100µg inhaler use achieve base dose requirement . An approximately equivalent inhaler device one patient originally use use . Equally participant normally used spacer device ICS , provide use Qvar pMDI . A Participant Instruction Appointment Leaflet issue , detail : Emergency contact number How perform PEF How write diary Record adverse event concomitant medication use Withholding time drug The Patient Instruction Leaflet discuss fully subject question answer Participants issue pre-labelled container collection overnight urine sample night prior visit V2 V3 respectively , write instruction do . Visit 2 ( V2 ) : Sections 3.7.2 3.7.10 3.7.13 repeat . Visit 3 ( V3 ) : Sections 3.7.2 3.7.10 repeat . The study end point patient return prescribed medication .</detailed_description>
