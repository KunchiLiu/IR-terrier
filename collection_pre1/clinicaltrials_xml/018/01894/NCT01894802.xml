	<detailed_description>Individuals tetraplegia ( paralysis cause illness injury result partial total loss use arm leg ) intact brain function unable move due injury disease affect spinal cord , nerve muscle . Brain-machine interface ( BMI ) technology base find intact brain function , neural ( nerve ) signal generate even though reach arm , hand leg . By place ( implant ) sensor surface brain , individual train send neural signal interpret computer translate movement use control variety device computer display . Using neural activity control external device refer brain-machine interface ( BMI ) technology . In addition , area brain involve interpreting sensation arm , hand legs remain functional injury . It therefore possible send tiny electrical pulse implant array mimic sensory input would normally come arm , hand legs . The investigator refer `` microstimulation . ''</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Subjects must limit ability use hand due cervical spinal cord injury , brainstem stroke spinal stroke . Individuals tetraplegia must less grade 4 muscle strength elbow extension wrist extension less grade 2 strength finger flexor abduction contralateral side implant . We include subject complete incomplete injury . 2 . Subjects must report unable perform functional activity hand contralateral implantation . 3 . Subjects must 1 year postinjury time implantation . In addition , subject must report worsen neurologic status ( strength , sensation ) previous 6 month . 4 . Subjects must age 2270 year old . Participants outside age range may increase surgical risk increase risk fatigue BMI training . 5 . Subjects must live within 1 hour University Pittsburgh study willing travel University Pittsburgh least per week BMI training . 6 . If subject live Pittsburgh area , expect stay somewhere within 1 hour University Pittsburgh least 18 month enrollment . 7 . Subjects must able communicate investigator English need follow instruction study team . 8 . Subjects must show understanding study goal ability follow simple direction judge investigator 9 . Subjects must result within normal limit neuropsychological psychosocial assessment ; psychosocial health support assess interview psychologist . 10 . Subjects must able activate distinct cortical area imagine attempted movement task ( i.e . hand movement speaking move mouth ) ; evaluate functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) part screen . 11 . Subjects must stable psychosocial support caregiver able perform necessary daily care participant 's skin pedestal site . This require subject identify caregiver backup place great 6 month able provide need physical psychosocial support . This assessed sponsorinvestigator study neurosurgeon . 12 . Subjects must life expectancy great 18 month assess study investigator neurosurgeon subinvestigator 13 . Documentation informed consent must obtain participant legal representative . 1 . Visual impairment extend view computer monitor would difficult even ordinary corrective lens 2 . Another serious disease ( ) disorder ( ) could affect ability participate study ( verified preop anesthesia evaluation determine surgical risk status ) 3 . Recent history pressure sore could exacerbate 12 day bed rest 4 . Metallic implant ( ) would prohibit subject fMRI scan ; spinal fixators generally nonferrous would exclude someone participate study 5 . Any type implantable generator pacemaker , spinal cord stimulator , cochlear implant , deep brain stimulator ( DBS ) , DBS lead , vagus nerve stimulator , defibrillator 6 . Women childbearing age pregnant , lactate , plan become pregnant next 25 month 7 . Allergy contrast medium kidney failure could exacerbate contrast agent ( MRI ) 8 . Subjects receive medication ( sedative ) chronically may retard motor coordination cognitive ability 9 . Individuals require routine MRI , therapeutic ultrasound , diathermy 10 . Individuals osteomyelitis 11 . Severe skin disorder cause excessive skin sloughing , lesion breakdown scalp 12 . History myocardial infarction cardiac arrest intractable cardiac arrhythmia 13 . Individuals implant hydrocephalus shunt 14 . Individuals stroke caused surgical procedure 15 . Active infection ( ) unexplained fever ( verified preop anesthesia evaluation determine surgical risk status ) 16 . Consumption 1 alcoholic beverage per day average 17 . Receiving chronic oral intravenous steroid immunosuppressive therapy 18 . Active cancer within past year ( adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer ) require chemotherapy 19 . Uncontrolled insulin dependent diabetes mellitus 20 . Uncontrolled autonomic dysreflexia within past 3 month ( spinal cord injury ) 21 . Individuals seizure disorder currently treat antiepileptic medication individual familial history seizure disorder 22 . Individuals attempt suicide past 12 month 23 . Individuals immunosuppressed condition typically result immunocompromise ( include , limited : ataxiatelangiectasia , cancer , ChediakHigashi syndrome , combine immunodeficiency disease , complement deficiency , DiGeorge syndrome , HIV/AIDS , hypogammaglobulinemia , Job syndrome , leukocyte adhesion defect , malnutrition , panhypogammaglobulinemia , Bruton disease , congenital agammaglobulinemia , selective deficiency IgA WiscottAldrich syndrome ) 24 . Individuals previous neurosurgical intervention involve frontal lobe ( especially motor cortex ) and/or parietal lobe ( especially somatosensory cortex ) likely impact viability intracortical electrode 25 . Individuals active psychiatric concern , include limited major depression , bipolar disorder , schizophrenia psychotic disorder posttraumatic stress disorder 26 . Individuals substance abuse within 6 month study participation</criteria>
