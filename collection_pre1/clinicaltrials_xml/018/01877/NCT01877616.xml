	<brief_summary>Little known prevalence sleep disorder role increase prevalence cardiovascular disease develop world . We To assess prevalence major sleep disorder rural South American population , determine whether condition associate poor cardiovascular health occurrence stroke ischemic heart disease . This three-phase , population-based , door-to-door survey Atahualpa . During phase I , resident age ≥40 year screen validated Spanish version five questionnaire evaluate major sleep disorder . In phase II , neurologist examine person suspect sleep disorder random sample negative individual assess prevalence condition validate accuracy questionnaire . In phase III , patient confirm sleep disorder undergo nocturnal polysomnography achieve specific diagnosis . The occurrence sleep disorder correlate cardiovascular health population well presence stroke ischemic heart disease . This epidemiological study may prove cost-effective improve sleep condition people live rural area develop country , may use model evaluation sleep disorder cardiovascular correlate population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sleep Disorders Their Cardiovascular Correlates Atahualpa .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For purpose present part Atahualpa Project , field personnel train achieve expertise use screening questionnaire , assure uniformity data collection . The independent review board Hospital-Clínica Kennedy ( Guayaquil , Ecuador ) approve study design inform consent form sign Atahualpa resident age ≥40 year enrollment study . Field worker perform census population detect Atahualpa resident age ≥40 year ( include live village time previous census ) . Those `` new '' person interview assess social demographic characteristic evaluate CVH status way do rest population recent survey . During current survey , consent person undergo physical examination attention measurement neck circumference , well evaluation facial characteristic relevant coexistence sleep disorder , include retrognathia , nasal septum deviation , asymmetry naris , palate position . The latter evaluate tongue rest inside mouth ( use Friedman classification ) categorize four class accord structure visible : Grade I allow visualization entire uvula tonsils/pillars , Grade II allow visualization uvula tonsils/pillars , Grade III allow visualization soft palate uvula , Grade IV allow visualization hard palate . From many questionnaire available detection person suspect sleep disorder , panel agree choose widely use show time-efficient , consistent reliable prediction major sleep disorder . Field instrument include validated Spanish version insomnia severity index , Pittsburgh sleep quality index , Epworth sleepiness scale , Berlin questionnaire , four minimal diagnostic criterion restless legs syndrome . The insomnia severity index consist seven question evaluate nighttime sleep difficulty , sleep dissatisfaction , impact insomnia quality life . Time-frame evaluation two week test . Each question rat five-point Likert scale range 0 ( ) 4 ( extremely ) maximum total score 28 . Scores 0 7 mean clinically significant insomnia , 8 14 mean subthreshold insomnia , 15 21 mean moderate clinical insomnia , 22 28 mean severe clinical insomnia . The Pittsburgh sleep quality index basically discriminate `` good '' `` poor '' sleeper . Time-frame evaluation month test . It consist 18 question group seven component score , weight 0 3 scale , total score 21 , high score indicate poorer sleep quality . Components include assessment sleep duration ( total sleep time ) , sleep disturbance , sleep latency , day dysfunction due sleepiness , sleep efficiency , overall sleep quality , medication need sleep . Total sleep time categorize follow : &lt; 6 hour , 6 7 hour , 7 8 hour ( referent category ) , 8 9 hour , &gt; 9 hour . The original instrument also include five additional question direct bedpartners roommate . Such question use present survey include scoring validate Spanish language . The Epworth sleepiness scale originally evaluate level person 's daytime sleepiness base likelihood doze eight different sedentary situation , use help diagnose hypersomnia sleep-disordered breathing obstructive sleep apnea . Each eight question rat four point Likert scale range 0 ( chance fall asleep ) 3 ( high chance fall asleep ) maximum total score 24 . While noted considerable overlap among score chance sleep-disordered breathing , show score ≥10 highly correlate presence severe obstructive sleep apnea . The Berlin questionnaire mainly evaluate sleep-disordered breathing ( obstructive sleep apnea ) , also assess waketime sleepiness fatigue presence obesity arterial hypertension . It consist 10 question , divide three category . The first five question include category 1 , question six eight category 2 , question 10 category 3 ( question nine evaluate separately ) . A positive response two question first 2 category , single question category 3 , mark correspond category `` positive '' , positivity two category classify person `` high risk '' obstructive sleep apnea . The four minimal diagnostic criterion restless legs syndrome develop facilitate recognition sleep-related movement disorder . All four question must positive establish diagnosis restless legs syndrome . In second phase epidemiological survey , board-certified sleep neurologist ( P.R.C . ) provisionally move Atahualpa examine person screen suspected case sleep disorder ( one field instrument use ) . In addition , random sample 2 % individual consider negative screening phase ( match age gender suspect case ) also undergo specialize examination ass possible false negative case survey . Neurologists blind whether individual positive negative screening phase . All person evaluate unified sleep history focus sleep-related symptom , associate nocturnal symptom , time sleep period symptom occur , daytime functioning , sleep schedule , use sleep medication ; addition , complete physical neurological examination perform . For person suspect restless legs syndrome , question direct assess frequency severity symptom , age symptom onset , family history restless legs syndrome . In addition , mimic condition rule ( leg cramp , positional discomfort , fibromyalgia , arthritis , neuropathy , claudication , etc ) . Correlation presence specific sleep disorder CVH status well history stroke ischemic heart disease note . Procedures use evaluation CVH status diagnosis stroke ischemic heart disease previously use step one Atahualpa Project . In brief , CVH status evaluate use seven metric proposed American Heart Association , stroke diagnosed patient experience rapidly develop event characterize clinical sign focal global disturbance cerebral function , last ≥ 24 hour , apparent cause vascular , ischemic heart disease diagnose person positive clinical judgment ECG finding . In third phase , patient confirm diagnosed sleep disorder invite undergo attended nocturnal polysomnography objectively evaluate presence sleep-disordered breathing , well well sleep disorder . EEG activity , nocturnal movement , cardiac rhythm , oxygen saturation . Studies perform Community Center The Atahualpa Project , multiple channel recording , include : electroencephalogram , electro-oculogram , electromyogram chin leg , electrocardiogram , body position sensor , nasal oral airflow , oxygen saturation , video audio recording , may involve trial continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) investigation .</detailed_description>
