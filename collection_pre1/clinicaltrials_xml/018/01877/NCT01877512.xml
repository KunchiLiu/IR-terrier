	<brief_summary>Rationale : Abnormally low high level insulin-like growth factor-I ( IGF-I ) associate increase metabolic risk . Since ( U-shaped ) association IGF-I , within normal range , also find cardiovascular risk factor disease general population , would interest investigate association also find growth hormone deficient ( GHD ) adult treat Growth Hormone ( GH ) . This could interest endocrinologist prescribe GH clinical practice strict dosing may become even important . Next , scientific evidence clinical practice want . Objective : Next cardiovascular risk factor ( main objective : body composition lipid profile ; secondary objective : remainder ) investigate effect glucose metabolism , physical performance , neuropsychological function different level IGF-I GH treat GHD men woman . Study design : Open-label randomized trial . Study population : At least 32 subject , childhood adult onset GHD men woman , receive GH treatment least one year , age 20 65 year . Intervention : At entry subject already receive GH treatment accord general clinical practice , expect demonstrate IGF-I concentration 0 - 1 SD score ( SDS ) ( normal dose ) . The group men group woman randomize receive either decrease regular dose GH treatment ( IGF-I target level -2 - -1 SDS ) ( low dose ) , increase regular dose , ( IGF-I target level 1 - 2 SDS ) ( high dose ) least 24 week .</brief_summary>
