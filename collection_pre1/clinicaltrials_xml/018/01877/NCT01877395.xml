	<brief_summary>The aim study document safety immunogenicity Purified Vero Rabies Vaccine ( VRVg ) give simulate post-exposure regimen , i.e . co-administration human rabies immunoglobulin ( Imovax® Rabies ) . Primary Objectives : - To demonstrate VRVg non-inferior Imovax® Rabies term proportion subject achieve rabies virus neutralize antibody ( RVNA ) titer ≥ 0.5 international unit ( IU ) /mL Day 14 . - To demonstrate observed proportion subject achieve RVNA titer ≥ 0.5 IU/mL Day 14 least 99 % , low limit 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) least 97 % . Secondary Objectives : - To assess clinical safety vaccine vaccine injection administer simulated post-exposure schedule . - To describe geometric mean titer ratio ( GMTR ) 2 vaccine group Day 14 .</brief_summary>
