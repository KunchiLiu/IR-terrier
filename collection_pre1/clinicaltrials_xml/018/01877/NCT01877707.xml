	<brief_title>Near Patient Microbial Testing Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . To determine longitudinal profile sputum Cystic Fibrosis patient allow accurate prediction exacerbation study large group confirm 7+ day early warning system work large group . 2 . Is one biomarker sufficient predict exacerbation - accuracy ? Are two biomarkers require achieve accuracy great 95 % ? 3 . Can accurately determine many hospital bed day home testing/wellness monitoring device would save ? What business case healthcare provider adopt future test home use ? We estimate 50 % save . Can confirm ? 4 . When used clinic , many hospital day would test save fast determination treatment efficacy ? What business case adopt future test point care test ward Cystic Fibrosis centre ? Could new revolutionary tool anticipate ? 5 . We forecast 50 % reduction cost treat Cystic Fibrosis patient disease severity band 2-A 5 . Can provide evidence support investment ?</detailed_description>
