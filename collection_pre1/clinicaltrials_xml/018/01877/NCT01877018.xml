Interventions promote preventive activity primary care well receive population ; case colorectal cancer , direct recommendation primary care professional carry screen one factor greatest impact increase population participation program . Care overload , circuit design screen without direct intervention primary care professional multiplicity task must face , element influence low recommendation screen target population consults reason . The introduction specific reminder electronic medical record ( widespread use primary care ) , tool facilitate encourage direct referral physician nurse practitioner perform colorectal cancer screen mean increase least 10 % participation target population , increase efficiency screen program .

	<brief_title>Colorectal Cancer Screening Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) important public health problem country . Over last decade , several autonomous region Spain carry screen program , population participation rate remain recommended European target . Reminders electronic medical record ( EMR ) identify low-cost high-reach strategy increase participation . The population-based colorectal cancer screen program city Barcelona aim men woman age 50 69 involve immunochemical fecal occult blood test ( iFOBT ) every 2 year . Community pharmacies participate program charge delivery collection iFOBT . Aims : Main : To asses effectiveness intervention primary care , use reminder system apply electronic medical record promote population 's participation Public CRC Screening Program . Secondary : - To know population 's reason refuse take part screen program . - To know health professional ' opinion official program implementation . - To know health professional ' opinion implementation new computerized tool . Methods : Design : Randomized controlled trial cross-sectional second phase . Setting : 11 primary care center Subjects : Inclusion criterion Patients - Men woman , age 50-69 , average risk develop CRC , involve participate first round population-based CRC screen program ( N 57.020 ) . - To register primary care physician ( PCP ) one center participate . Health care professional : - All physician nurse work every center voluntarily participate ( N 280 ) . Exclusion criteria Patients : Refusal participate . Health care professional : Refusal participate center work . Intervention It consist enter reminder EMR patient ( e-cap program ) , form specific icon , medical scheduler , identifies subject invite take part CRC screen program . The alert address physician nurse , order promote CRC screening , brief advice ask patient fill data collection sheet specifically design study also include EMR . Health care professional intervention group train session intervention 's characteristic development . Sample size : The target population register center involve study 60.000 people . It estimate 90 % invited participate screening program . In case low participation ( 30 % ) , result sample could identify difference least 10 % control group intervention group , alpha error 5 % statistical power 95 % , estimate loss follow rate 20 % . Randomization : The randomization unit PCP . The allocation participant PCPs control intervention group carry stratified random sample center , allocate 50 % physician control intervention group , respectively . The nurse allocate intervention/control group accord study group PCP share patient care . Patients allocate intervention/control group accord study group PCP . Masking : Given nature intervention , 's mask health professional statistician responsible statistical analysis , due objectivity final outcome n't think result could influence fact . Moreover data manager CRC screen program , responsible data management participation outcome , know study group invite population allocate . Patients also unaware study group assign , access EMR . Outcomes : Primary outcome : CRC screen status ( Update , update , exclusion ) Secondary outcome : - Patient 's characteristic : age , gender , socioeconomic deprivation index , risk factor colorectal cancer , clinical risk group , number visit . - Health professional characteristic : age , gender , knowledge CRC screening . - Reminder : date sheet fill , previous participation CRC screen program ( yes , barrier ) , exclusion criterion ( normal colonoscopy within previous five year , high CRC risk personal family history , symptom CRC ) , intention participate ( yes , barrier ) . - Health Professionals Opinion questionnaire : Population-based CRC screen program : Information give , process operation , primary care professional implication . Electronic reminder : usefulness , usage , operation . Data collection : Data obtain population base CRC screen program , EMR two questionnaire cross-sectional second phase . Statistical analysis : Data analyze use Stata , version 12.1 , statistical software package intention-to-treat approach apply . Analyses include standard descriptive statistic , Student 's test , correlation regression , examine difference group . All test two-tailed alpha level 0.05 applied criterion statistical significance . Limits : Given nature intervention great social , economic demographical difference population register center participate study , take physician unit randomization , instead center patient . External validity : This urban population study , EMR universally use Catalonia 's primary care center , n't expect difference due area work . Ethical aspect : The investigator commit comply prevailing norm Good Clinical Practice , well requirement Declaration Helsinki clauses general particular ethical condition relate right privacy , anonymity confidentiality . Neither first name surnames type data indicate identity subject register . Therefore , identification make numerical code . Since type study develop usual clinical setting , authorization support must already grant representative authority group involve thus , individual inform consent necessary . However , consent target population attend primary care appointment register EMR . The protocol approve Clinical Investigation Ethics Committee Jordi Gol Gurina Foundation ( protocol number P10/31 ) .</detailed_description>
