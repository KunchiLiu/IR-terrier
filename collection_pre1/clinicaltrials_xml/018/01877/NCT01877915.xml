	<brief_title>A Study Assess Effectiveness Safety Rivaroxaban Reducing Risk Death , Myocardial Infarction Stroke Participants With Heart Failure Coronary Artery Disease Following Episode Decompensated Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , double-blind ( neither physician participant know identity assign treatment ) , parallel group ( participant group receive different treatment simultaneously ) , event driven ( study duration determine time take specific number event occur ) , multicenter study ass effectiveness safety rivaroxaban compare placebo , reduce risk death , myocardial infarction stroke participant heart failure significant coronary artery disease follow episode decompensated heart failure . Participants randomly assign 1:1 ratio receive either rivaroxaban placebo ( addition standard care heart failure coronary artery disease prescribe manage physician ) . The study consist screen phase , double-blind treatment phase , follow-up sponsor-announced global treatment end date ( GTED , define date 1200 primary efficacy outcome event predict occur ) . The double-blind treatment phase estimate last 6 54 month . Participants discontinue study drug take morning evening dos GTED return study center end-of-study visit ( 15 45 day sooner 15 day GTED ) . Patient safety monitor throughout study . The average study duration participant expect approximately 29 month . The study drug , rivaroxaban , approve United States multiple country around world prevention treatment number thrombosis-mediated condition .</detailed_description>
