	<brief_summary>The present study aim investigate effect transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) associate physiotherapy parkinson´s rehabilitation . Previous study show tDCS could reduce bradykinesia , one symptom Parkinson disease . In way , study combine tDCS physiotherapy order enhance motor rehabilitation quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>12 patient participate study.After screen check eligibility criterion give informed consent , randomize two group . All patient submit 10 therapeutic session occur 3 time per week . Before , immediately 1 month last session patient submit evaluation follow test : Unified Parkinson´s Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) , Jebsen Taylor Test ( JTT ) Parkinson 's Disease Quality Life ( PDQL ) . Furthermore , session patient submit transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) evaluate cortical excitability motor threshold motor evoke potential . In experimental session , subject always receive physiotherapy conventional technique , protocol follow clinical practice guideline physical therapy Parkinson disease Royal Dutch Society Therapy . During tDCS protocol patient seat comfortable chair head arm rest . Continuous current apply use pair saline-soaked surface sponge electrode ( surface 35 cm2 ) , anode electrode place primary motor cortex cathode contralateral orbit . tDCS apply twice stimulation 13 minute 20 minute interval current strength 1mA . Sham tDCS apply current flow 30 .</detailed_description>
