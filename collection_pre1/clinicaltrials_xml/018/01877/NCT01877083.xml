	<brief_summary>This Phase 2 , open-label , safety activity study lenvatinib subject KIF5B-RET-positive adenocarcinoma lung confirm RET translocation . At least 20 subject KIF5B-RET treat receive lenvatinib start dose 24 mg orally , per day . Additional subject RET translocation treat lenvatinib start dose 24 mg orally , per day . The study consist 3 phase : The Pretreatment Phase , The Treatment Phase Extension Phase . The Pretreatment Phase include screen procedure eligibility assessment . The Pretreatment Phase consist Screen 1 , Screen 2 Baseline Period . The Treatment Phase begin subject meet eligibility criterion Day 1 first Treatment Cycle . The Treatment Phase contain Treatment Follow-up Periods . The Extension Phase begin subject receive treatment study ( either Treatment Period Follow-up Period ) time database cutoff .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Subjects must cytological histological confirm diagnosis adenocarcinoma lung . 2 . Subject must know RET positive ( know KIF5BRET translocation , confirm RET translocation ( e.g. , CCDC6RET ) ) available tumor sample local central testing obtain prior consent ( Screen 1 ) . Subjects whose sample need submit central laboratory test must current nonsmoker know mutation EGFR , KRAS , ALK . 3 . Subjects may receive three prior systemic anticancer treatment regimens adenocarcinoma lung ( include adjuvant therapy tyrosinekinase inhibitor [ TKI ] ) , unless discuss sponsor . 4 . Subjects must clinically indicate need systemic chemotherapy adenocarcinoma lung base investigator 's assessment 5 . Presence measurable disease meeting follow criterion : 1 . At least one lesion least 1.0 cm longaxis diameter nonlymph node least 1.5 cm shortaxis diameter lymph node serially measurable accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors 1.1 ( RECIST 1.1 ) use either computerized tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . If one target lesion nonlymph node , long diameter least 1.5 cm . 2 . Lesions previously treat radiotherapy locoregional therapy must show radiographic evidence disease progression deem target lesion . 6 . Subjects know brain metastasis complete whole brain radiotherapy , stereotactic radiosurgery , complete surgical resection eligible remain clinically stable , asymptomatic steroid 28 day . 7 . Adequate bone marrow function , define : 1 . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal 1.5 x 10^9/L ( great equal 1500/mm^3 ) 2 . Hemoglobin ( Hb ) great equal 8.5 g/dL 3 . Platelet count great equal 75 x 10^9/L ( great equal 75,000/mm^3 ) 8 . Adequate liver function , define : 1 . Bilirubin le equal 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) except unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia Gilbert 's syndrome 2 . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) less equal 3 x ULN ( less equal 5 x ULN subject liver metastasis ) . If alkaline phosphatase great 3 x ULN ( absence liver metastasis ) great 5 x ULN ( presence liver metastasis ) AND subject also know bone metastasis , liverspecific alkaline phosphatase must separate total use ass liver function instead total alkaline phosphatase . 9 . Adequate renal function , define calculated creatinine clearance great 40 mL/min per Cockcroft Gault formula . 10 . Adequately control blood pressure ( BP ) without antihypertensive medication , define BP le 150/90 mmHg screen change antihypertensive medication within 1 week Cycle 1/Day 1 ( C1D1 ) . 11 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status ( PS ) 0 1 . 12 . Survival expectation 12 week longer start study drug . 13 . Males female age least 18 year ( age great 18 year determine country legislation ) time inform consent ( Screen 1 ) . 14 . Females must breastfeed pregnant Screening Baseline ( document negative betahuman chorionic gonadotropin [ BhCG ] test minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit BhCG ) . A separate baseline assessment require negative Screening pregnancy test obtain 72 hour first dose study drug . 15 . All female consider childbearing potential unless postmenopausal ( amenorrheic least 12 consecutive month , appropriate age group without know suspected cause ) sterilize surgically ( i.e. , bilateral tubal ligation , total hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy , surgery least one month dose ) . 16 . Females childbearing potential must unprotected sexual intercourse within 30 day study entry must agree use highly effective method contraception ( e.g. , total abstinence , intrauterine device , doublebarrier method [ condom plus diaphragm spermicide ] , contraceptive implant , oral contraceptive , vasectomized partner confirm azoospermia ) throughout entire study period 30 day study drug discontinuation . If currently abstinent , subject must agree use double barrier method describe becomes sexually active study period 30 day study drug discontinuation . Females use hormonal contraceptive must stable dose hormonal contraceptive product least 4 week dose must continue use contraceptive study 30 day study drug discontinuation . 17 . Male subject must successful vasectomy ( confirm azoospermia ) female partner must meet criterion ( i.e. , childbearing potential practicing highly effective contraception throughout study period 30 day study drug discontinuation ) . No sperm donation allow study period 30 day study drug discontinuation . 18 . Provide write informed consent ( Screen 1 Screen 2 ) 19 . Willing able comply aspect protocol 1 . Subjects receive anticancer therapy ( include surgery , locoregional , biological , immunotherapy , hormonal , radiotherapy ) within 21 day first dose study drug ( 28 day investigational therapy ) . 2 . Leptomeningeal metastasis brain metastasis except Inclusion Criterion # 6 . 3 . Subjects recover toxicity result prior anticancer therapy less Grade 2 severity per National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) v4.0 , except alopecia infertility . 4 . Significant cardiovascular impairment : history congestive heart failure great New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class II , unstable angina , myocardial infarction , stroke within 6 month first dose study drug , cardiac arrhythmia require medical treatment Screening . 5 . Gastrointestinal malabsorption condition opinion investigator might affect absorption lenvatinib . 6 . Active malignancy ( except adenocarcinoma lung definitively treat melanoma insitu , basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , carcinoma insitu cervix ) within past 24months . 7 . Major surgery within 3 week first dose study drug . 8 . Bleeding thrombotic disorder use anticoagulant warfarin similar agent require therapeutic international normalize ratio ( INR ) monitoring . ( Treatment low molecular weight heparin allow . ) 9 . Active hemoptysis ( bright red blood least 0.5 teaspoon ) within 3 week first dose study drug . 10 . Active infection ( infection require treatment ) . 11 . Symptomatic central nervous system ( CNS ) disease . 12 . Subjects great 1+ proteinuria urine dipstick test undergo 24hour urine collection quantitative assessment proteinuria . Subjects urine protein great equal 1 g/24hour ineligible . 13 . Any medical condition opinion investigator ( ) would preclude subject 's participation clinical study would preclude complete study . 14 . Scheduled surgery study .</criteria>
