	<brief_title>Study SelfFit Mobile Medical App Hearing Loss Diagnostics Hearing Device Fitting / Fine Tuning</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The technology utilize within mobile medical App partially describe US patent application US2011/0002490A1 . The app use combination hear aid deliver output target accurate individual acoustical amplification effective compensation user hearing loss . The electronic circuitry incorporate digital signal processing algorithm - dynamic range compression , noise reduction - provide acoustical amplification accord parameter ( acoustical gain , compression ratio , time constant ) calculate App base in-situ hearing loss diagnostics ( pure tone audiometry , loudness scaling ) . Within study , amplification parameter transmit prototyped device prototyped audio streaming box . Individual audiogram represent hear threshold ( soft audible sound ) different frequency . At least two test frequency use involve one low region device 's bandwidth ( 750 Hz ) one high region device 's bandwidth ( 2 kHz ) . Hearing threshold assess present pure tone different know level ( SPL ) user threshold test frequency determine accord user response verbally formulate question ( many tone hear ? ) multiple choice answer button ( 0 , 1 , 2 ) . Second hearing loss characteristic obtain app . personal loudness scaling . By present band-limited noise stimulus collect user response perceive loudness level Medical Mobile App calculate dynamic range user hear give frequency . The calculation optimal amplification parameter perform App use proprietary `` fitting formula '' derive scientific data . Final adjustment amplification parameter call fine tuning perform present user realistic acoustical environment operation hear device . Fine tune relates slight change parameter initially obtain `` fitting formula '' . The acoustical signal present use audio stream hearing aid . In particular present signal include `` speech quiet '' `` speech background noise '' . Presented speech signal compose two source process different signal processing parameter . During presentation speech signal App present speech source visually two speaker . The user ask provide listen preference choosing preferred speaker . The signal processing parameter relate preferred sound use final adjustment hearing device .</detailed_description>
