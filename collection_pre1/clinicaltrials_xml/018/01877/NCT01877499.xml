	<brief_title>Can High Convection Volumes Achieved Each Patient During Online Post-dilution Hemodiafiltration ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemodialysis ( HD ) common use renal replacement therapy worldwide . The main objective removal excess fluid toxic solutes patient . Despite relative efficiency modern dialyzer , HD remain inferior normal kidney function , part inadequate clearance so-called 'middle molecule ' . In word , 'uremic toxin ' accumulate chronic HD patient . The role middle molecular weight uremic toxin pathogenesis many co-morbid condition associate end-stage renal disease increasingly recognize . Hence , hypothesis enhance removal could convey good survival propose . Actually , HDF effective modality term solute removal , solute transport achieve diffusion ( especially small molecule ) convection ( important clearance route middle molecule ) . Although convective transport achieve high-flux HD , HDF amount filter volume reach value 20 liter per session . In line thinking , two RCTs compare HDF standard hemodialysis either low- high-flux membrane perform . However , treatment assignment alter primary outcome all-cause mortality neither . Interestingly , post‐hoc analysis trial unequivocally show reduced mortality patient group achieve high convection volume . Whether data result so‐called dose-targeting bias ( healthy patient reach high volume ) formally exclude , noteworthy result remain correction know determinant mortality . Moreover , careful examination patient ' baseline characteristic CONTRAST HDF cohort reveal healthy profile among high convection volume group . Recently , third trial find significant 30 % decrease mortality HDF apply mean convection volume 23.7 L per session , somewhat high average volume reach aforementioned trial ( respectively 20.7 19.5 L per session ) . Altogether , finding support concept dose-response effect , minimally deliver convection volume require order show survival benefit . Hence , question arise whether high convection volume achievable majority patient . In previous sub-analysis CONTRAST , find important determinant achieve convection volume treatment time blood flow rate . Moreover , note convection volume filtration fraction ( define ratio extract plasma water flow rate blood flow rate ) differ markedly per participate center , suggest different practice pattern . Thus , plausible optimization apparently seemingly modifiable factor , individual basis dedicate standardized protocol , could translate high achieve convection volume . The aim study test follow hypothesis : high‐volume ( &gt; 22 liter per treatment ) post-dilution on‐line hemodiafiltration ( HDF ) achievable majority ( &gt; 75 % ) patient treat chronic intermittent hemodialysis . This study prospective observational study , enrol patient treated post-dilution on-line HDF application standardize protocol aim maximize convection volume . At begin study , patient 's usual dialysis parameter serve start parameter . In addition , incident HDF patient start filtration fraction 25 % ( equivalent ) post‐dilution mode . Then , convection volume increase stepwise successively optimize three important determine factor . First , treatment time increase 4 h , possible . Second , blood flow increase 50 mL/min per treatment value 400 mL/min reach , provide pre-specified safety limit respect . Third , filtration fraction increase 2 % per treatment maximum 33 % maximally achieve value within safety limit . To take account different setting various dialysis machine use participate center , easy-to-use conversion table provide nursing staff , allow find parameter ( substitution flow , substitution volume substitution ratio ) corresponding desire filtration fraction . At end step-up protocol , achieve convection volume assess compare start value . Additionally , follow-up period 8 week , maximum value target parameter keep , observed order ass whether high convective volume maintain long period .</detailed_description>
