	<brief_summary>This first-in-human , multicenter , open-label study consist 2 phase . Phase 1 dose escalation study RXDX-105 ( formerly know CEP-32496 ) patient advance solid tumor aim define recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) schedule administration . Phase 1b dose expansion approximately 90 patient advance solid tumor specific histology and/or molecular alteration interest . Patients Phase 1b treated RP2D determine Phase 1 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study RXDX-105 , Potent RET Inhibitor Patients With Advanced Lung Cancer Other Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective Phase 1 determine recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) RXDX-105 . The primary objective Phase 1b ass safety profile tolerability RXDX-105 RP2D The secondary objective evaluate antitumor activity RXDX-105 RP2D , assess objective response rate ( ORR ) ( complete response [ CR ] partial response [ PR ] ) use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors version 1.1 ( RECIST v1.1 ) patient advance solid tumor RET BRAF mutation rearrangement . The RP2D determine Phase 1 portion study close new patient enrollment . Phase 1 b open enrol patient solid tumor harbor RET rearrangement mutation , BRAF rearrangement mutation . Additionally , patient Squamous NSCLC lung adenocarcinoma alteration RET BRAF KRAS mutation , etc . also enrol . Approximately 90 patient enrol Phase 1b . Each phase study consist 28-day screening period . Patients treat 28-day treatment cycle document radiographic progression , unacceptable toxicity , withdrawal consent , protocol specify parameter stop treatment . Patients Phase 1 1b follow 6 month last dose study treatment .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Phase 1b : 1 . Patients must histologically cytologically confirm advanced solid tumor histology and/or molecular alteration interest define Section 4 , detect CLIAcertified equivalently accredit diagnostic laboratory • Squamous NSCLC Nonsquamous NSCLC ( know RET alteration BRAF V600E mutation ) patient must archival tissue available analysis Ignyta ; patient must send tissue Ignyta , tissue available 2 . Prior Treatment : Patients BRAF V600E mutation must TKInaïve ; number prior therapy allow NSCLC patient RET alteration prior RET inhibitor RET inhibitornaïve enrol ; ( number prior therapy allow ) ; histology RET alteration must RET inhibitornaïve Patients Squamous NSCLC Nonsquamous NSCLC ( know RET alteration BRAF V600E mutation ) may prior TKIs number prior therapy 3 . Measurable disease accord RECIST v1.1 patient except patient RET alter tumor ; patient RET alter tumor must evaluable disease , require measurable disease 4 . Patients treat , stable CNS metastasis , include leptomeningeal carcinomatosis allow . The use seizure prophylaxis allow . Patients require steroid must stable decrease dose least 2 week prior start RXDX105 treatment . 5 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 2 6 . Able ingest oral medication 7 . Other inclusion criterion apply Exclusion Criteria Phase 1b : 1 . Treated systemic anticancer therapy investigational agent within 2 week 5 halflives , whichever short , prior start study drug treatment ( 4 week antibody therapy immunotherapy , 2 week bevacizumab colon cancer patient ) 2 . Major surgery 21 day less prior start study drug recover adverse effect therapy 3 . Radiotherapy within 2 week prior start study drug treatment ( palliative radiation stereotactic radiosurgery within 7 day prior start study treatment ) . Patients must recover radiotherapyrelated toxicity 4 . History nonpharmacologically induce prolonged QTc interval ( e.g. , repeated demonstration QTc interval &gt; 500 millisecond ECGs perform least 24 hour apart ) 5 . Major active infection require parenteral antibiotic 6 . Severe unstable medical condition , congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] Class III IV ) , ischemic heart disease , uncontrolled hypertension , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , psychiatric condition , well uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia require medication ( ≥ Grade 2 , accord NCI CTCAE v4.03 ) , myocardial infarction within 6 month prior start study treatment , significant unstable concurrent medical illness opinion Investigator would preclude protocol therapy 7 . History previous cancer would interfere determination safety efficacy RXDX105 respect qualify solid tumor malignancy 8 . Known infection human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) active hepatitis B hepatitis C 9 . Current participation another clinical study investigational agent , vaccine , device . Concomitant participation observational study acceptable 10 . Presence significant gastrointestinal disorder , opinion Investigator Sponsor , could interfere absorption RXDX105 ( e.g. , malabsorption syndrome , gastrointestinal surgery ) 11 . Known hypersensitivity component RXDX105</criteria>
