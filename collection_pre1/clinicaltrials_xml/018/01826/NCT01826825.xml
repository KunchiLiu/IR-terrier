	<detailed_description>Detailed Description : Background Significance : Approximately one-third elective surgical patient see BWH Preoperative Test Center 65 year age old national trend similar . 15-30 % community dwell elder cognitive impairment . Such impairment identify base chronologic age alone considerable heterogeneity cognitive ability within age group . In clinical practice , however , brain one major organ system assess formally preoperatively , pre-existing cognitive deficit often go unrecognized . This potentially important deficiency give advance age many surgical patient , difficulty cognitive impairment may impose ability follow postoperative instruction , fact research study show association pre-existing cognitive impairment risk perioperative morbidity mortality . Thus , preoperative cognitive performance may predictor and/or modifier postoperative outcomes.1,2,3 Interestingly , study document patient perception regard relationship cognitive performance patient outcome among elder present elective surgical procedure . Objectives : Objective 1 : To determine whether two short cognitive test administer preadmission test center equally useful cognitively stratify elderly patient present elective surgical procedure . Objective 2 : To evaluate cost cognitive screen preoperative test center term time finance . Objective 3 : To evaluate patient perception use preoperative cognitive screening outcome expectation surgical procedure . Subsequent investigation may evaluate whether preoperative cognitive screening predictor postoperative morbidity mortality elderly surgical patient . Subject Selection : Two hundred patient age 65 year schedule elective surgical procedure without plan postoperative admission ICU identify Weiner Center Preoperative Evaluation ( PATC ) . The study include patient gender schedule surgery without plan admission ICU . Exclusion criterion include formal diagnosis dementia ( e.g . Alzheimer 's disease ) , uncorrected vision hearing impairment ( necessary see picture hear instruction ) , inability speak , read understand English , schedule surgical procedure affect brain cerebrovasculature ( i.e . intracranial neurosurgery , carotid endarterectomy ) . These age choose cognitive impairment become prevalent age 65 year age patient age group great risk develop serious postoperative complication . Subject Enrollment : The Brigham Women 's Hospital study site . When patient check preoperative evaluation ask registration desk whether study investigator discus objective risk study perform preadmission test center . If patient agree member investigative team greet patient describe purpose study along risk benefit provide consent form read . After patient read consent form ask additional question . Once question answer patient give opportunity decline provide write informed consent study . Study Procedures : After consent obtain investigator thank patient open next available seal envelop contain study registration ID number open envelope wherein group patient randomize display along 3 sticker registration ID place test documentation . The Registration ID 's randomly assign group base result random number generator . After randomization investigator hand patient Patient Survey ( see Patient Survey attach ) clipboard pen attach patient compete survey wait room preadmission test center . Once complete investigator collect survey . If patient randomize Clock-in-the-box test hand instruction test allow read . After patient read instruction patient hand instruction investigator place copy test form clipboard patient use . After patient complete clock-in-a-box test return investigator thank patient participation study . A trained member investigative team score clock-in-a-box test preadmission test center visit . ( See attachment A Clock-in-the-Box test scoring ) . For patient randomize Mini-Cog , trained member preadmission test center team involve patient routine preoperative evaluation administer test course patient preoperative evaluation quiet room . They first instruct patient remember 3 unrelated word ( egg , apple , table , penny ) . The patient request repeat word back clinician ensure heard word . Next patient instruct draw face clock hand specific time ( time 11:10 endorse ) . Finally patient instruct recall 3 word . The Mini-Cog score give 1 point word recall , normal clock score 2 point abnormal clock receive 0 point . Mini-Cog score range 0 ( bad score ) 5 ( best score ) . Because study intend detect dementia impact current medical care test score release patient referral neurologist formal cognitive evaluation although subsequent investigation may study value ( see Attachment 2 Mini-Cog test scoring ) . Other data collect include age patient , total duration time patient spent preadmission test center ( check-in time departure time ) , duration preoperative evaluation ( time preoperative evaluation room ) identify CPE track system monetary cost time area compare variable patient age 65 present preoperative evaluation week week study period compare use Student 's t-test . Biostatistical Analysis : For Clock-in-the-Box test number patient score 0-8 age 65-74 v 75 determine analyze use chi square analysis . For Mini-Cog test number patient score 0-5 age 65-74 v 75 determine analyze use chi square analysis determine whether tool use cognitive stratification patient preadmission test center . One would expect old patient would score low test compare young patient . This study involve medical intervention treatment diagnosis disease process rather determine whether cognitive stratification elder feasible within establish flow preoperative test center process Brigham Women 's Hospital , cost testing , patient perception regard value . Survey data presented percentage patient agree statement binary provide valuable patient center insight perception preoperative cognitive stratification outcome goal result upcoming surgical procedure . Data duration time spend preadmission test center duration 1:1 preoperative evaluation study versus non-study patient age 65 analyze use Student 's t-test . Risks Discomforts : Risks patient minimal , cognitive screening result report aggregate personally identifiable information . The cognitive screen impact patient care thus alter patient outcome although patient may experience stress difficulty cognitive exam . All effort make minimize risk select investigator train protocol cue monitor patient undo stress . Patient participation study discontinue time opinion investigator best interest patient discontinue participation patient request withdrawal study Potential Benefits : There expect benefit individual subject participate study . This study potential aid improve decision-making physician elderly patient future reveal relationship poor preoperative cognitive status adverse postoperative outcome elder . Monitoring Quality Assurance : Regardless monitoring plan , principal investigator ultimately responsible ensure study conduct his/her investigative site accordance IRB-approved protocol applicable regulation requirement IRB . The Principal Investigator member investigative team monitor subject single site , review accuracy completeness Clock-in Box , Mini-cog survey report , source document inform consent . There Data Safety Monitoring Board result study impact care patient receive . The outcome study intend publish peer-reviewed manuscript . All adverse event report Partners Human Research Committee ( HRC ) accordance HRC guideline . A 24-hour/7-day telephone pager number provide contact licensed physician investigator purpose . The research staff monitor subject course study involvement evidence adverse event unexpected stress test discontinue incident report Partners Human Research Committee within 24 hour local event awareness ( late next business day ) . The report include complete description event , use concomitant medication , local investigator 's assessment causality adverse event . Follow-up evaluation do resolution adverse event , unlikely protocol non-invasive</detailed_description>
