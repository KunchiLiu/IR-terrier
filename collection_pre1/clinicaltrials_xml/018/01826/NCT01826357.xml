	<brief_summary>The metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) cluster clinical index signal increase risk cardiovascular disease Type 2 diabetes . Women polycystic ovary syndrome ( PCOS ) associate MetS insulin resistance . Cluster analysis useful tool identify group woman share similar metabolic risk factor pattern . Oligomenorrhea , hyperandrogenism polycystic ovary morphology three major component PCOS . Obesity main risk factor metabolic syndrome . investigator interest evaluate relationship risk metabolic syndrome clinical and/or biochemical characteristic woman reproductive age . Design : Retrospective study ; medical record review . Participants set : The investigator retrospectively review medical record female patient visit Reproductive Endocrinology Clinic Jan. 1 , 2009 Jun . 31 , 2012 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Definitions metabolic syndrome base arbitrary cutoff point several quantitative variable , variable relate linearly cardiovascular risk . Even consensual definition differ international authority continue change . Moreover , cutoff gender ethic difference . Cluster analysis statistical method base algorithm , seek minimize within-group variation maximize between-group variation cluster variable . This technique suitable define group , reflect natural structure data without rely inappropriate arbitrary cutoff . We conduct retrospective study review medical record female patient visit Reproductive Endocrinology Clinic Jan. 1 , 2009 Dec. 31 , 2012 . Cluster analysis perform studied case evaluate correlation clinical/biochemical characteristic risk metabolic risk woman reproductive age .</detailed_description>
