	<brief_summary>In current treatment colon cancer , definition locally advance colon cancer ( LACC ) controversial , clinical trial evidence support treatment LACC clear . Irinotecan ( CPT-11 ) combine fluoropyrimidine ( 5FU , capecitabine ) main chemotherapy regimen patient advance colorectal cancer . Whether regimen also could effectively apply patient locally advanced colon cancer ? It worthy clinician conduct research . In recent study , literature indicate uridine diphosphate glucuronide transfer enzyme ( UGT1A1 ) important metabolic enzyme associate drug metabolism CPT-11 . The gene polymorphism UGT1A1 relate delayed diarrhea neutropenia cause irinotecan . Irinotecan dose-exploration study find maximum tolerate dose irinotecan patient UGT1A1*28 homozygous variant genotype significantly low compare wild genotype . The study base Asian patient suggest gene variant UGT1A1*6 also similar impact . At present , study irinotecan dose adjustment base UGT1A1 gene polymorphism yet come consistency conclusion . The frequency UGT1A1 gene polymorphism different race significant different , irinotecan dose exploratory study base Chinese patient carry . This study focus prospectively adverse reaction , optimal efficacy R0 resection rate patient LACC treat dose-adjusted irinotecan base genotype UGT1A1 .</brief_summary>
