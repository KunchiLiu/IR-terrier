	<brief_summary>Genomics research advance rapidly , link gene obesity continue discover well define . A grow number single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) multiple gene show alter individual 's response dietary macronutrient composition . Based prior genetic study evaluate body 's physiological response dietary carbohydrate fat , investigator identify multi-locus genotype pattern SNPs three gene ( FABP2 , PPARG , ADRB2 ) : low carbohydrate-responsive genotype ( LCG ) low fat-responsive genotype ( LFG ) . In preliminary , retrospective study ( use A TO Z weight loss study data ) , investigator observe 3-fold difference 12-month weight loss initially overweight woman determine appropriately match vs. mismatch low carbohydrate ( Low Carb ) low fat ( Low Fat ) diet base multi-locus genotype pattern . The primary objective study confirm expand preliminary result determine weight loss success increase dietary approach ( Low Carb vs. Low Fat ) appropriately match individual ' genetic predisposition ( Low Carb Genotype vs. Low Fat Genotype ) toward diet .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If intriguing preliminary retrospective result confirm full scale study , result demonstrate inexpensive DNA testing could help dieter predict whether great weight loss success Low Carb Low Fat diet . Commensurate increase scientific interest personalize medicine approach intervention development , would provide example potentially substantial health impact could obtain understand specific gene-environment interaction anticipate unraveling human genome . Mobile App Sub-Studyâ€”For purpose augment adherence high vegetable consumption diet group , develop theory-based mobile app increase vegetable consumption goal-setting , self-monitoring , social comparison . Participants diet group iPhones re-randomized receive app either month 4-5 month 7-8 . The first phase month 4-7 use compare effect mobile app ( intervention ) vs. mobile app ( waiting-list control ) . The priori hypothesis vegetable consumption increase among receive app diet arm . The investigator outcomes assessor blind group assignment . Intention-to-treat analysis use .</detailed_description>
