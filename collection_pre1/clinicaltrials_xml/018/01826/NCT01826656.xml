	<brief_summary>Both pathogenesis treatment osteoporosis may potentially interfere different level multi-stage complex cascade event involve bone healing/regeneration . To knowledge human study perform clarify potential effect osteoporosis post-extraction alveolar healing . The primary outcome study compare alveolar bone change width height 3 month tooth extraction 10 post-menopausal osteoporotic woman 10 post menopausal non osteoporotic woman use cone-beam computer tomography ( CBCT ) image . The secondary outcome consider : clinical change external contour ridge periodontal parameter neighbour teeth tooth extraction 3 month later . In addition accuracy panoramic morphometric index detect osteoporosis measure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite contradictory result , significant pre-clinical evidence , mainly derive fracture study , delay bone formation together decrease bone mineral density mechanical resistance osteoporotic-like condition . Very human data available , mainly derive retrospective speculation , seem confirm existence delay consolidation subsequent bone fracture , high rate orthopedic complication reduction mechanical strength . Some pre-clinical clinical study also support negative effect osteoporosis bone graft heal implant success , controversial opinion exist . A useful model study influence osteoporosis bone heal post-extraction socket healing , consideration absence cartilage formation , short period need heal clinical relevance . The animal study report controversial result , general reduction delay bone formation increase bone turnover usually observe ovariectomized rat . No human study clarify effect osteoporosis post-extraction alveolar healing . This pilot study try shed light topic . As similar study literature , estimate 10 post-menopausal osteoporotic woman ( test ) 10 healthy pre post-menopausal woman ( control ) would convenient sample collect enough data purpose . This also allow u collect information variance power study ( need ) . In study , woman need extraction single tooth due fracture , destroy caries , periodontitis , endodontic prosthetic reason include . The tooth present least 30 % periodontal attachment preserve . All patient provide full-mouth diagnosis soft hard tissue , detailed hygiene instruction careful removal plaque tartar highly control research environment part project treatment free charge . Subjects test group recruit among newly diagnose post-menopausal osteoporotic woman attend Rheumatology clinic University College London Hospital , whilst subject control group recruit among healthy woman attend Eastman Dental Institute . Written inform consent obtain prior clinical evaluation . Differences test control group assess time interval use either parametric ( data normally distribute approximately equal variance ) non-parametric test .</detailed_description>
