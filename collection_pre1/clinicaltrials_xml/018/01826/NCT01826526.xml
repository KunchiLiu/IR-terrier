	<brief_title>Clinical Trial With Catheter Locking TauroSept® ( Taurolidine 2 % ) Saline Solution 0,9 %</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Home Parenteral Nutrition become mainstay support patient chronic intestinal failure . It require presence central venous catheter assure adequate venous access . Catheter Related BloodStream Infections ( CRBSIs ) frequent . Most CRBSIs originate contamination catheter hub subsequent growth microorganism embed within biofilm rapidly develop inner catheter surface . The best preventive measure development CRBSIs observation strict hygiene guideline insert manipulate central venous catheter addition instillation antimicrobial solution like TauroSept® saline solution 0.9 % catheter lumen ( antimicrobial lock ) . This measure currently widely use clinical practice .</detailed_description>
