	<brief_title>Autologous Dendritic Cells Treating Patients With Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability dendritic cell ( DC ) -AdGM carbonic anhydrase IX ( CAIX ) administer intradermal injection study dos schedule . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate clinical antitumor effect follow study treatment accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) guideline version 1.1 . Parameters include objective response ( complete response [ CR ] , partial response [ PR ] ) , duration response patient objective response , time disease progression . II . To evaluate immune response DC-AdGMCAIX vaccination enzyme-linked immunospot ( ELISpot ) numeric determination CAIX specific T cell blood . III . To evaluate immune response DC-AdGMCAIX vaccination cytokine profile T cell culture supernatants characterization immune response subject demonstrate immune activation may perform . IV . To evaluate immune response DC-AdGMCAIX vaccination anti-sargramostim ( GM-CSF ) antibody response . V. To evaluate tumor biopsy immune cell infiltrates . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive AdGMCAIX-transduced autologous dendritic cell intradermally ( ID ) day 1 , 15 , 29 . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2-3 month least 6 month .</detailed_description>
