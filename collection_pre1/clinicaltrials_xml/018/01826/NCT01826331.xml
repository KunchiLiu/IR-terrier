Those incentivized biologically validate prolonged abstinence 6 12 month could also choose participate TTM ( Transtheoretical Model ) -tailored intervention ; 3 . An assessment control condition . The Specific Aims : 1 . To assess whether treatment group incentivized participation outperforms control group 12 , 24 36 month hypothesize ; 2 . To assess whether treatment group incentivized prolonged abstinence 6 12 month outperforms control group follow-up hypothesize ; 3 . To assess whether treatment group incentivized participation outperforms treatment group incentivized outcomes 36 month hypothesize . 4 . To compare cost-effectiveness treatment population mostly unmotivated smoker ; The Secondary Aims : 1 . To assess long-term treatment trajectory treatment compare control hypothesize increase trajectory participation contingent incentive decrease trajectory outcome contingent incentive . 2 . To identify mediator long-term outcome treatment , amount treatment participation , income , severity smoking , stage change , self-efficacy , perceive health intrinsic extrinsic motivation quit . 3 . To compare cost-savings treatment model additional cost smoke employer smoker .</detailed_description>
