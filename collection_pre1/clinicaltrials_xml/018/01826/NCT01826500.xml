	<brief_summary>The five protein ITI ( Inter-α-trypsin inhibitor ) family , essential component extracellular matrix , dynamic participate process cellular differentiation proliferation . I . The ITIH1 , ITIH2 , ITIH3 ITIH4 gene seem overwhelmingly express liver , organ secrete correspond protein general circulation . The data ITIH5 indicate gene poorly express liver major source expression placenta . In context genetic study syndrome Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser ( congenital aplasia uterus vagina ) , investigator show involvement ITIH5 implement validation experiment gene mouse . The investigator show production ITIH5 uterus varies greatly depend physiological state organ , especially pregnancy estrous cycle . The investigator also find production ITIH5 locate uterus . Therefore , serum dosage ITIH5 could use clinically new biological marker specific uterus . This non-invasive biological marker could thus assist diagnosis understand uterine pathology . ITIH5 rate correlate endometrial proliferation , dosage could early non-invasive marker endometriosis . The peak production ITIH5 uterus time embryo implantation window indicates assay could provide good assessment endometrial receptivity embryo . It could hand tool diagnosis case early repeat miscarriage , secondly , prognostic tool embryo implantation context vitro fertilization . The investigator conduct initial feasibility study serum dosage ITIH5 , approve ethic committee University Hospital Rennes . This first step validate . Now , project perform quantitative analysis ITIH5 correlate clinical biological data relevant pathological physiological situation . This project subject national international patent University Hospital Rennes promoter .</brief_summary>
