	<brief_summary>Many patient admit intensive care heart lung problem . Patients condition often require long duration support breathe machine . Survival long-term recovery improve investigator remove breathe support quickly . In study , investigator focus patient severe lung heart disease examine whether particular type breathing machine ( NAVA ventilator ) allow u remove breathe support quickly less need sedative medication , compare current practice .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist Adults Risk Delayed Weaning From Mechanical Ventilation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , compare use Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist technology ( NAVA ventilation mode monitor capability ) standard care patient risk prolong period mechanical ventilation . Study aim To inform design definitive randomise control trial ( RCT ) undertake feasibility testing , evaluation propose NAVA intervention evaluation propose outcome . Feasibility outcomes - Number eligible patient - Assessment screen recruitment method - The willingness clinician allow recruitment - The willingness participant randomise - Assessment randomisation process - Staff attitudes training need - Protocol compliance ( barrier use NAVA ventilation ) Intended primary outcome main study *Ventilator-free day ( day 28 ) There number secondary outcome include : - Total sedation / hypnotic / analgesic dose - Ventilator free day ( day 90 ) - Duration invasive mechanical ventilation ( MV ) - Duration MV ( include Non-invasive ventilation ( NIV ) ) - Duration post extubation NIV - Incidence delirium ( CAM-ICU ) - Change sequential organ failure assessment ( SOFA ) score baseline day 3 , 7 , 14 28 - ICU hospital length stay - Day 28 , ICU discharge , hospital discharge 90 day post randomisation survival - Agitation / comfort ( Richmond Agitation Sedation Score ( RASS ) plus Visual *Analogue Scale possible ) - Frequency sedation / analgesic / hypnotic bolus dose - Ventilator associate pneumonia ( develop 48 hour study entry ) - Unplanned device removal ( eg . ET tube , catheter etc . ) - Patient-ventilator asynchrony - Duration ventilation mode - Change electrical activity diaphragm ( EAdi ) - Health Resource Group cost - Quality life 90 day - SF36 questionnaire STUDY DESIGN A pilot feasibility , single centre , open label randomise control study . In summary , group one receive standard care group two receive standard care addition NAVA technology . POPULATION Intubated , critically ill high-risk elective peri-operative adult patient great risk difficult prolong weaning : pre-existing cardiopulmonary dysfunction . Inclusions ICU admission likely remain intubated ventilate great 48 hour diagnosis one combination : 1 . COPD 2 . Left and/or right ventricular heart failure 3 . Mild , moderate severe ( Berlin criterion ) Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) All diagnosis must document medical note . There must evidence specialist consultant diagnosis , non-specialist doctor diagnosis either objective test result ( spirometry , CT , lung biopsy , cardiac echo ) and/or prescribe treatment . Exclusions - Less 18 year old pregnant . - Inability conduct protocol ( e.g . research staff NAVA technology unavailable ) . - No personal nominated consultee available assent decline . - Greater 96 hour intubation . - Greater 24 hour wean phase . - Patient likely die/have treatment withdrawal within 48 hour . - Contraindication pass NG tube . - Patients primary neurological cause ventilator dependence . - High spinal injury C6 ; severe traumatic brain injury ( Glasgow Coma Score &lt; 8 ) . - Suspected proven hypoxic brain injury . - Physician refusal / physician wish use NAVA . - Hepatic encephalopathy great grade one . - Domiciliary ventilation ( except Continuous Positive Pressure ( CPAP ) Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure ( BIPAP ) use sleep disordered breathing ) . - Enrollment another interventional clinical trial last 30 day . - Non-English speaker inadequate translation available allow inform consent . STUDY SITE Three adult ICUs KCH NHS Foundation Trust , London . SAMPLE SIZE 76 patient recruited estimate anticipate compliance 75 % ( 95 % confidence interval +/- 10 % ) . FOLLOW-UP SF-36 occur 90 day post ICU discharge .</detailed_description>
