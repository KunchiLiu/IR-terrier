	<brief_summary>For every child developmental delay , investigator constitutional karyotype . This karyotype reveal apparently balance chromosomal rearrangement ( visible loss gain genetic material ) , translocation two chromosome accidental occurrence ( transmitted parent ) . However , apparently balance translocation explain phenotype child . Among hypothesis could explain child 's symptom , possibility another chromosomal abnormality translocation breakpoints , another defect elsewhere chromosomes gene disruption near breakpoints . Because resolution constitutional karyotype limit , microanomalies go undiagnosed . The goal study look microanomaly chromosome use technology high resolution conventional karyotype . The propose study use DNA microarray technology DNA extract blood lymphocyte perform high-resolution analysis chromosome search unbalanced microrearrangement ( loss gain chromosomal material ) . If microrearrangement find , investigator pursue look gene disruption defect near breakpoints involve translocation . This do first isolate chromosome involve translocation flow cytometry hybridize isolate chromosome new microarray . The purpose study find possible cause explain phenotype ( microrearrangement gene disruption ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Breakpoint Analysis de Novo Apparently Balanced Chromosomal Translocations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psychomotor delay observe approximately 3 % general population various cause : environmental , genetic ( gene chromosome ) unknown . Chromosomal abnormality identify 15 % syndromic psychomotor delay ( ie . associate another symptom ) . Balanced chromosomal translocation observe one every 1000 individual 6 % patient de novo apparently balance translocation abnormal phenotype ( Warburton , 1991 ) . Review literature , concern microarray analysis de novo apparently balance translocation patient psychomotor delay , reveals : * 40 % case : abnormality identify karyotype , either translocation breakpoints different location genome , * 60 % case : abnormality find resolution 25kb ( Schluth-Bolard et al. , 2009 ) . The technique generally use clone breakpoint identify disrupt gene `` walk '' chromosome . This technique use fluorescent probe , BACs PACs , locate derivative chromosome side breakpoints . This technique labor-intensive , time-consuming expensive one must probe along derivative chromosome , close closer breakpoint , order find probe overlap breakpoint . The investigator propose original , innovative quick technique map chromosome translocation breakpoints patient psychomotor delay abnormality microarray analysis . The main aim develop technique identify new gene clone map chromosome translocation breakpoints . These gene would candidate explain phenotype patient.The study cover 24 month period include 10 patient . The feasibility technique , well application routine laboratory diagnosis , evaluate . The study approve local Bioethics Committee respect french law bioethics.Methodology : Patients well select staff meeting include clinician biologist . An initial microarray analysis well perform identify gain loss genetic material . Samples gain loss identify well undergo flow cytometry isolate derivative chromosome . Each derivative chromosome well hybridise new microarray , thus reveal breakpoint . The breakpoints confirm FISH technique molecular biology technique well applied clone sequence breakpoints . Databases well use check gene locate around breakpoints . Required information : Administrative data ( 3 first letter last name 2 first letter first name , date birth , identification parent , informed consent ) . Clinical biological data ( phenotype , karyotype , genetic study ) . Expected result : Development rapid less expensive technique clone translocation breakpoints , Identification gene potentially involved mental delay anomaly embryo development , Evaluation distribution various cause syndromic mental delay ( unbalanced translocation microarray , additional rearrangement microarray , gene disruption , unidentified cause ) .</detailed_description>
