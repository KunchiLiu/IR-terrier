	<brief_summary>This study identify significant clinical parameter individual risk factor relate certain prostate disease ( BPH , prostatitis prostate cancer ) . With identified important correlation , locally generate bias free nomogram construct predict prostate biopsy outcome among Asian men indication prostate biopsy . While study evaluate accuracy predictive value novel prostate disease nomogram .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This cross-sectional study prospectively collect data patient first Transrectal ultrasound ( TRUS ) prostate biopsy Stone Prostate Treatment Center St. Luke 's Medical Center-Quezon City . Data collect uniformly purpose build clinical care prostate biopsy database . The indication prostate biopsy either suspicious DRE finding elevate Prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) level ( &gt; 4.0ng/ml ) . The clinical information gather include 1 . Identified risk factor ( age , family history , race , Body Mass Index ( BMI ) - kg/cm2 , prostatitis , medication ) 2 . Clinical indicator prostatic disease ( abnormal digital rectal examination , hypoechoic lesion transrectal ultrasound ) , 3 . PSA ( ng/ml ) derivative ( age-specific PSA , PSA density , PSA velocity , Free PSA percentage ) . ( Refer Data Collection Form ) . Basic demographic data patient 's height weight measure use standard weight scale ( Detecto 439 Mechanical Scale Height rod , Webb City MO , USA ) . A urologist member team perform DIgital Rectal Exam ( DRE ) patient TRUS . Serum free total PSA level measure Institute Pathology use Siemens ADVIA Centaur Free PSA PSA ( Seimens Healthcare Diagnostics , USA ) within month prior prostate biopsy . Prior prostate biopsy , prostate scan use biplanar 7.5 Megahertz probe ( GE Medical Systems Kretz Ultrasound , Zipf , Austria . Prostate volume measure radiology technician [ member staff team ] center use transverse sagittal plane standard equation measurement prolate ellipsoid [ width ( w ) x height ( h ) x length ( l ) x 0.523 ] . All prostate biopsy uniformly require 12 core ( extended scheme ) prostate tissue strip ultrasound guidance Fr 18 25cm biopsy device ( Bard Urological , US ) , perform systematically cover lateral medial aspect apex , midgland base right leave prostate lobe . Two additional biopsy obtain ultrasound image DRE finding indicate suspect area . All acquire specimen place formalin-filled container send histopathologic examination . All specimen examine least 2 board-certified pathologist Institute Pathology determine presence inflammation ( acute/chronic prostatitis ) , disease entity , carcinoma ( positive carcinoma , read include grade use Gleason score , cancer length biopsy specimen , percent cancer involvement . All pathologist blind clinical indicator patient . An intermediate result subject immunohistostaining definitive conclusion . At least two pathologist require release final report . Data collection extraction use pre-tested standardized form . All collect form submit Clinical Information Service St. Luke 's Medical Center encode preliminary analysis incidence prevalence . Additional analysis send third party statistician validation reliability check . Confidentiality data acquire assure . All patient record cod database PIN . Patient name include encode databank . Only investigator team clinical information service section St. Luke 's Medical Center access data set encode . Hospital policy safekeeping hospital record strictly follow stored Medical Record section medical center .</detailed_description>
