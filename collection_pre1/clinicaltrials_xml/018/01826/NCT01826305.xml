	<brief_summary>In study plan compare efficacy independent exercise perform patient home formal rehabilitation therapy follow primary total knee replacement . Patients randomize two cohort enrollment study follow prospectively . Patients randomize formal rehabilitation cohort receive prescription therapy twelve week . Patients randomized independent exercise cohort receive online access twelve-week protocol exercise perform home strengthen improve function replace joint . At enrollment , baseline evaluation conduct capture demographic , height , weight , primary diagnosis , medical comorbidities , social support well completion select outcome measure , American Knee Society ( AKS ) Score , Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS ) . Secondary outcome include measurement health status use Short Form-12v2 ( SF-12v2 ) activity level University California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) Activity Score . At twelve-week , six-month twelve-month follow-up visit , study subject complete KOOS , SF-12v2 , UCLA Activity Score questionnaire . Statistical analysis perform compare outcomes two cohort . Hypothesis : There difference outcome formal rehabilitation independent exercise twelve month primary total knee replacement surgery use American Knee Society ( AKS ) Knee Score .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Independent Exercise Compared With Formal Rehabilitation Following Primary Total Knee Replacement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We randomize patient schedule primary total knee arthroplasty receive either prescription formal physical therapy ( PT ) instruction independent exercise . Inclusion criterion : schedule primary total knee arthroplasty , age eighteen year old , speak English , computer access Internet . Exclusion criterion : knee arthroplasty total knee , patient plan return follow care , patient rely others basic functioning , speak English , computer access Internet . Enrollment occur initial clinic visit surgeon 's office . Informed consent receive patient participate study initial clinic visit patient randomize equally either PT/OT independent exercise cohort use REDCap website randomization feature . REDCap secure , web-based application building manage online survey databases utilized study data management . Patients randomize PT cohort prescribe formal therapy twelve week supervise exercise regain knee strength range motion . Therapists involve study design therapist inform patient participate study . The content , frequency , duration rehabilitation program discretion treat therapist , consistent usual practice . The patient independent exercise cohort register www.careforpatients.com , online rehabilitation resource provide computer aid rehabilitative exercise . Patients follow prepared 12-week protocol exercise perform postoperatively gradually regain knee strength range motion . Post-operative week 0 - 1 , patient perform three set ten repetition everyday : supine ankle pump , supine heel slide , seat quad set , supine glut set , supine hip abduction/adduction . The patient also perform three set patella mobilization one minute three set one repetition supine knee extension . Post-operative week 1 - 2 , patient perform three set ten repetition everyday : supine heel slide , prone knee flexion , supine knee extension , supine SLR flexion , sidelying SLR abduction , prone SLR extension , sidelying SLR adduction . The patient also perform three set patella mobilization one minute three set one repetition supine knee extension weight . Post-operative week 2 - 4 , patient perform three set ten repetition everyday : stand knee extension , stand knee flexion , stand SLR flexion , stand SLR abduction , stand SLR extension , stand SLR adduction . The patient also perform three set patella mobilization one minute , three set sit hamstring stretch thirty second , prone quad stretch thirty second , three set single leg stance thirty second . Post-operative week 4 - 8 , patient perform three set ten repetition everyday : bilateral mini squat , stand SLR flexion , stand SLR abduction , stand SLR extension , stand SLR adduction . The patient also perform three set sit hamstring stretch thirty second prone quad stretch thirty second . Post-operative week 8 - 12 , patient perform three set ten repetition everyday : bilateral wall squat , forward step-up , side step-up . The patient also perform three set sit hamstring stretch thirty second prone quad stretch thirty second . Patients advise perform exercise often possible , least day . All patient regularly schedule follow-up visit per usual practice six-weeks post-operatively , six-months post-operatively , 12-months post-operatively physical exam perform check range motion knee , gait , low leg muscle strength . The primary outcome trial evaluate efficacy formal therapy compare independent exercise twelve month surgery use American Knee Society ( AKS ) Knee Score . Secondary outcome include Knee Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ( KOOS ) measurement health status use Short Form-12v2 ( SF-12v2 ) activity level University California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) Activity Score . At enrollment , baseline evaluation conduct capture demographic , height , weight , primary diagnosis , medical comorbidities , social support well completion select outcome measure , AKS , KOOS , SF-12v2 , UCLA Activity Score . At twelve-week , six-month twelve-month follow-up visit , study subject complete AKS , KOOS , SF-12v2 , UCLA Activity Score questionnaires clinic visit contact telephone mail complete questionnaires appointment twelve-week , six-month twelve-month follow-up .</detailed_description>
