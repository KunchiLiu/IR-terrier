	<brief_summary>Rationale : Thoracic complaint , possibly due cardiac ischemic cause diagnostic challenge general practice . When underlie ischemic cardiac condition ( AMI ( acute myocardial infarction ) , UAP ( unstable angina pectoris ) ) consider , referral general practitioner ( GP ) cardiologist take place . However , cardiac analysis 80 % referred patient negative . To optimize referral decision GPs , new fast diagnostics need . Objective : To assess incremental diagnostic value AMI novel rapid PoC H-FABP-test addition history take physical examination patient present daily general practice possible AMI . In addition cost-effectiveness test evaluate . Study design : Delayed type cross-sectional diagnostic study . Study population : Patients present GP new-onset chest complaint , time presentation last 24 hour , consider possible cardiac origin GP . Intervention : Point care Heart Type Fatty Acid Binding Protein test ( PoC H-FABP-test ) , add usual care . PoC H-FABP-testing , qualitatively measure H-FABP one single drop blood obtain finger prick , add normal procedure consultation referral decision GP . Main study parameter / endpoint : Sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value point care H-FABP-testing AMI , alone well part clinical diagnostic algorithm , patient thoracic complaint general practice . All outcome measure , base use algorithm and/or point care H-FABP-testing , compare regular diagnostic assessment GP without use algorithm and/or point care H-FABP-testing . Therefore , incremental value H-FABP-testing and/or diagnostic algorithm measure . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Individual participant experience low risk , since study participation comprehend regular care except extra finger prick possibly collection one extra venous blood sample . For low amount disadvantage , participant experience advantage either . However , result study possibly useful similar patient future .</brief_summary>
