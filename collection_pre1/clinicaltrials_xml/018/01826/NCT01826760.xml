	<brief_title>Study Model Predict 3-month Mortality Risk Acute-on-chronic Hepatitis B Liver Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) major human pathogen cause high morbidity mortality worldwide . HBV one lead cause rapid deterioration liver function , serious condition term `` acute-on-chronic liver failure ( ACLF ) '' high mortality . There high prevalence HBV Asian develop country acute-on-chronic hepatitis B liver failure ( ACHBLF ) account 70 % ACLF almost 120 , 000 patient die ACHBLF year . The transplantation liver basic strong effective therapeutic option ACHBLF patient . However , liver transplantation difficult extensively apply due shortage liver donor socioeconomic problem . Thus , early predictive model , objective , reasonable accurate , necessary severity discrimination organ allocation decrease mortality ACHBLF . MELD-based score system still fail predict mortality considerable proportion patient predictive accuracy satisfy enough . The ANN novel computer model inspire work human brain . It build nonlinear statistical model deal complex biological system . In recent year , ANN model introduce clinical medicine clinical validation , include predict hepatocellular carcinoma patient ' disease-free survival preoperative tumor grade , predict mortality patient end-stage liver disease identify risk prostate carcinoma .</detailed_description>
