	<detailed_description>Radiation androgen deprivation common modality patient localized prostate cancer . Unfortunately patient intermediate high risk prostate cancer incomplete tumor eradication subsequent relapse occur 50-75 % patient . The Src pathway appear integral pathobiology prostate cancer may fundamental radioresistance . The primary objective trial establish safety dasatinib androgen deprivation radiation prostate cancer . Three dasatinib dose level evaluate , 50 mg/day , 70 mg/day 100 mg/day . Dasatinib begin day # 1 radiation discontinue radiation complete . The study treatment period , therefore , patient receive concurrent dasatinib , hormone therapy radiation 30 day last radiation/dasatinib treatment . However , highly recommend , prior enter study , patient receive 2 month androgen deprivation LHRH agonist . Furthermore , highly recommend , completion dasatinib /hormone therapy/radiation , patient intermediate risk disease receive approximately 2 additional month hormone therapy ( complete 6 month hormone therapy ) patient high risk disease receive 20 additional month ADT complete 2 year hormone therapy . If casodex give onset diagnosis , patient must drug 6 week prior begin radiation therapy</detailed_description>

Intermediate , high high risk disease Intermediaterisk disease ( clinical T2b T2c stage PSA 10 20 ng/mL Gleason score 7 ) Highrisk disease ( Gleason score 8 10 , serum PSA &gt; 20 ng/mL T3a disease ) Very highrisk disease ( T3b T4 ) No prior pelvic prostate radiation chemotherapy prostate cancer . Clinically negative lymph node establish image ( pelvic CT pelvic MR ) , nodal sample dissection within 8 week prior registration . Patients lymph node equivocal questionable image eligible node &lt; 1.5 cm . Bone scan within 12 week prior registration . Equivocal bone scan finding allow plain film negative metastasis . ECOG performance status 01 Age &gt; 18 Required entry laboratory parameter within 14 day study entry : Granulocytes ≥ 1500/µl ; platelet count ≥ 100,000/µl ; Hgb &gt; 8.0 g/dl ; Creatinine &lt; 1.5 x institutional ULN , mg/dl ; Bilirubin ≤ 2x institutional upper limit normal ; AST ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal , Serum Na+ , K+ , Mg2+ , Phosphate Calcium within institutional normal range ; PT PTT &lt; 1.5 ULN Life expectancy least 1 year No concurrent anticancer therapy . Peripheral neuropathy must ≤ Grade 2 A male subject father potential must use adequate method contraception throughout study [ least 4 week last dose study drug ] . Ability take oral medication ( dasatinib must swallow whole ) Signed studyspecific consent form prior study entry Conditions Patient Ineligibility Patients meeting follow exclusion criterion enrol study : Evidence distant metastasis ( M1 ) . Prior radical prostatectomy , cryosurgery prostate cancer , bilateral orchiectomy reason PSA &gt; 150 Pathologically positive lymph node node &gt; 1.5 cm image Major medical psychiatric illness , investigator 's opinion , would prevent completion treatment would interfere followup . Prior systemic chemotherapy study cancer ; note prior chemotherapy different cancer allowable . Prior radiotherapy , include brachytherapy , region study cancer would result overlap radiation therapy field Medical History Concurrent Diseases No malignancy [ one treat study ] require radiotherapy systemic treatment within past 5 year . Concurrent medical condition may increase risk toxicity , include : Pleural pericardial effusion grade Cardiac Symptoms ; follow consider exclusion : History significant bleeding disorder unrelated cancer , include : No history pulmonary hypertension</criteria>
