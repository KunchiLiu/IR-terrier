	<criteria>Subjects must provide write informed consent prior study related procedure ; Male female subject 30 year age know suspected CAD ; Subjects evaluate know suspected CAD either exercise pharmacologic MPI echocardiography ≥2 segment ischemia refer coronary angiography know suspected CAD ; Subjects must able complete evaluation within 30 day Tc99m MPI imaging , must without intervention change symptom test . Past present use medication target fatty acid uptake metabolism , e.g . Ranexa® ( Ranolazine ) ; Acute change comparison recent ECG ; Suspected acute coronary syndrome ; Chronic renal failure ( Cr &gt; 2.5 ) ; Anemia ( Hgb &lt; 10 within past 2 week ) ; NYHA Class III IV Congestive heart failure ; Severe heart valve disease ; Any exposure investigational drug device , within 30 day prior image study ; Any acute unstable physical psychological disease judge Investigators base medical history screen physical examination ; Female subject : Subject positive pregnancy test lactate possibility pregnancy rule prior dose . Females childbearing potential require confirmatory documentation medical record must negative pregnancy test within 4 hour prior receive test drug agree use acceptable form birth control least 30 day follow CardioPET™ administration . Male subject : Reliable contraception method first injection tracer 3 month last injection tracer . The following contraceptive method ( ) ( ) allow study : Condom . If partner become pregnant study , immediately report investigator .</criteria>
