	<brief_title>PET Imaging Study Using 11CPIB Subjects With AD &amp; Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study : 1 . To perform PET scan [ 11C ] PIB use direct ( i.e. , same-subjects ) comparison [ 11C ] PIB [ 18F ] AV-45 2 . To establish effective reliable PET image method detect amyloid deposition AD , order understand disease progression subsequently evaluate treatment effect . 3 . To ascertain PET image method minimize discomfort subject , thus increase potential clinical follow-up scan , reduce patient burden potential cost future PET examination . A separate protocol/study conduct use [ 18F ] AV-45 . Participants enroll protocol use [ 11C ] PIB consent participate [ 18F ] AV-45 ( IRB # NA_00033155 ) protocol/study mandatory requirement participant participate protocols.Up 20 participant mild moderate Alzheimer 's Disease 10 healthy volunteer participate study .</detailed_description>
