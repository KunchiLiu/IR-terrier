	<brief_title>Optimizing Outcomes Women With Gestational Diabetes Mellitus Their Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Women diagnose gestational diabetes increase risk develop prediabetes type 2 diabetes . To date , interdisciplinary intervention target predominantly ethnic minority low-income woman diagnose gestational diabetes . Programs need intervene prenatal period teach woman importance breastfeed improve metabolic control infant health continue birth promote improve nutrition exercise pattern weight loss . Using two-group , repeated measure experimental design , propose study test 14-week intensive intervention benefit breastfeed , understand gestational diabetes risk progression prediabetes type 2 diabetes , nutrition exercise education , cop skill training , physical activity ( Phase I ) 3 month continue monthly contact ( Phase II ) help overweight woman diagnose gestational diabetes improve metabolic , clinical , weight , adiposity , health behavior self-efficacy . Trends breastfeed duration intensity , maternal infant feed behavior , infant growth trajectory ( weight-for-length ) also measure . A total 100 African American , bilingual Hispanic , non-Hispanic White woman diagnose gestational diabetes induct randomized site either experimental wait-list control group . Data collect Time 1 ( Baseline 22-36 week pregnant ) , Time 2 ( 6 week postpartum ) , Time 3 ( 4 month postpartum completion Phase I ) , Time 4 ( 7 month postpartum completion Phase II ) , Time 5 ( 10 month postpartum 3 month ) . Primary maternal outcome include fast blood glucose weight ( BMI ) . Secondary maternal outcome include clinical outcome ( oral glucose tolerance test , insulin level , Homeostasis Model Assessment calculation , Hemoglobin A1c , complete lipid panel , blood pressure ) ; adiposity ( waist circumference , triceps subscapular skin fold ) ; health behavior ( Health Promoting Lifestyle Profile II , Adult Health Behavior Survey , Accelerometry 7 day ) ; self-efficacy ( Eating Self-Efficacy , Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale , Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale ) . Infant outcome include data weight status ( weight-for-length ) breastfeeding ( week stop breastfeed , week exclusively breastfed , intensity breastfeeding ) . Data analysis include analysis field note , post-intervention interview , recruitment retention effort . Linear mixed-effects random coefficient model construct measure effect intervention compare wait-list control group . Increasing breastfeed decrease overweight postpartum woman diagnose gestational diabetes may improve maternal glucose homeostasis weight stabilize infant growth trajectory , reduce burden metabolic disease across two generation .</detailed_description>
