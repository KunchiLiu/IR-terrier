	<brief_title>To Assess Pharmacokinetics Safety Single Doses JNJ-54452840 Healthy Japanese Caucasian Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 , randomize ( study treatment assign chance ) , double-blind ( neither physician participant know treatment receive ) , placebo-controlled ( one study treatment inactive ) , four-way cross-over study ( method use switch participant one treatment arm another clinical trial ) conduct healthy male Japanese Caucasian participant . The study conduct 3 part ; screen phase ( 28 day ) , double-blind treatment phase ( 28 day ) , follow-up phase ( approximately 21 28 day ) . The study conduct 2 group ( Group A consist 16 Japanese participant ; Group B consist 16 Caucasian participant ) 4 treatment period . On Day 1 Period 1 , approximately 16 eligible Japanese participant number eligible Caucasian participant randomly assign 1 4 treatment sequence receive 4 intravenous treatment JNJ-54452840 20 mg , JNJ-54452840 80 mg , JNJ-54452840 240 mg , placebo across treatment period accord order specify randomization schedule . Participants come study center time receive study medication discharge study center 24 hour dose treatment period satisfactory review clinical safety measure . Blood sample draw time point treatment follow-up period participant Group A Group B study . Participants return study center follow-up visit within approximately 7 10 day last study procedure last treatment period safety assessment , follow another visit within approximately 21 28 day assessment anti -beta-1-AR ( adrenergic receptor ) auto-antibodies blood ( auto-antibodies target human beta-1-AR antibody ) . If anti-beta-1-AR auto-antibodies detected second follow-up visit , additional testing perform every 3 month autoantibody level fall level detection assay 1 year , whichever occur early . Participants Group A Group B involve study approximately 12 week 1 year develop anti -beta-1-AR auto-antibodies . Safety participant monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
