	<brief_summary>Since decade , oral anticoagulation ( OAC ) vitamin K antagonist ( VKA ) establish therapy prevention treatment thromboembolism daily clinical routine . Increasing life-expectancy , demographic change novel oral anticoagulant lead increase complexity medical therapy . However , data quality management VKA therapy phenprocoumon current medical care limit . Our aim investigate quality OAC VKA current health care evaluate potential improvement . The investigator-initiated thrombEVAL study program comprise two cohort patient treat vitamin K antagonists oral anticoagulation therapy real-life setting : multicentre cohort patient regular medical care multi-local , single centre cohort patient telemedicine-based coagulation service . The study program expect enrol total number approximately 2,000 2,500 patient . Both cohort build detailed clinical assessment participant anticoagulation therapy study enrolment . Subsequently active passive follow-up investigation carry document validate complication treatment . Primary short-term outcome distribution time therapeutic range ; primary long-term outcome comprise composite stroke , systemic embolism , myocardial infarction , major clinically-relevant bleed death .</brief_summary>
