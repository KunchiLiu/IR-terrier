	<brief_title>Ofatumumab Induction Maintenance Elderly Patients With Poor Risk CLL Context Allogeneic Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study investigate safety efficacy consequent anti-CD20 therapy antibody ofatumumab context allogeneic HCT . Allogeneic HCT study intervention trigger availability HLA-compatible stem cell donor . The study divide induction part maintenance part . During induction antibody combine high dose dexamethasone , main goal reduce tumor load prior allogeneic HCT . Patients achieved disease control ( CR , PR SD ) antibody proceed maintenance therapy antibody . Patients progressive disease go study . The idea behind maintenance therapy ofatumumab may contribute tumor control early allogeneic stem cell transplantation T-cell base graft-versus leukemia effect still fully establish . External tumor control could lower pressure taper immunosuppressive drug early transplantation could thereby indirectly contribute good GVHD-prophylaxis . Furthermore , anti-CD20 antibody prove activity treatment chronic GVHD . In summary , concept consequent CD20 blockade context allogeneic transplantation could result good leukemic control well GVHD prophylaxis , highly attractive goal .</detailed_description>
