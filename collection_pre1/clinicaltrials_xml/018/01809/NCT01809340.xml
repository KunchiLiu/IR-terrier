	<brief_title>The Effect Minocycline Relapse After Successful Intravenous Ketamine/Minocycline-induced Symptoms Response Subjects With Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This placebo-controlled ( i.e. , inactive substance compare drug test whether drug real effect clinical trial ) , double-blind ( neither physician patient know treatment patient receives ) randomize ( drug assign chance ) study patient Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) Bipolar Disorder Type II . The study design ass whether antidepressant response treatment intravenous ( IV ) ketamine maintain treatment minocycline patient MDD Bipolar Depression Type II ( compare placebo ) . Both hospitalized patient well patient treat outpatient current episode depression qualify participation study . The study four sequential phase : eligibility study confirm 21-day screening phase , patient enter 12-day open-label ( ie , patient physician know intervention administer ) treatment phase patient receive 6 open-label IV infusion 0.5 mg/kg ketamine Day 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 12 combination open-label minocycline , orally administer twice daily . All patient remain study site least 4 hour IV ketamine administration . Response treatment assess use Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) design measure overall severity depressive symptom . Patients respond ketamine/minocycline treatment randomize receive minocycline placebo 6 week 6-week blind treatment phase relapse . A patient define `` ketamine responder '' 50 % decrease comparison baseline value ( Day 1 predose ) MADRS total score perform 3 4 hour postdose Days 8 , 10 , 12 , 40 % decrease baseline MADRS total score Day 12 . Patients respond treatment ketamine/minocycline give option receive 100 mg minocycline twice daily open-label treatment maximum 6 week . The patient ( responder non-responders ) weekly visit follow last dose ketamine Day 54 ( responders/non-responders ) relapse ( responder ) whichever come first , determine duration antidepressant effect ass safety tolerability completion treatment . Upon completion study ( Day 54 ) time relapse patient end-of-study visit . All patient return standard care treatment end study .
