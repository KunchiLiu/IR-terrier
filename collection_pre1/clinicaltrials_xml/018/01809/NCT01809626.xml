	<brief_summary>The primary goal single-blind , placebo-controlled , within-subjects , double-scan , one-visit neuroimaging study examine effect hypnotic zolpidem ( Ambien® ) individual maintain selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) treatment major depressive disorder . Specifically , level brain chemical GABA examine anterior cingulate thalamus , two brain region play important role mediate effect depression sleep-related drug , respectively . Depressed individual typically low level GABA healthy population , antidepressant treatment show help normalize neurochemical conjunction improve mood . Given individual maintain SSRIs often prescribe sedative/hypnotics treat concurrent insomnia , understand possible neurochemical interaction , whether beneficial harmful , important inform evidence-based treatment strategy treat co-morbid patient . Zolpidem 's effect GABA participant maintain SSRIs compare baseline GABA level individual ( i.e. , follow placebo administration ) . Two separate scan session last approximately 45-60 min take place within one single study visit order obtain measurement use proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1H MRS ) . This type neuroimaging like MRI non-invasive , permit u obtain information chemical brain . A secondary goal study compare subjective drug effect , individual feel , follow intervention . These measure use determine existence brain-behavior relationship order ass extent modulate GABA zolpidem effect mood state depress participant . Collectively , study contribute understand drug exert effect one administer presence , demonstrate imaging important tool inform u drug effect brain ultimately result behavior .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Proton MRS Study SSRI-Zolpidem Interactions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleep disturbance primary complaint least 35 % depressed patient , upwards one third individual take selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) treat major depressive disorder ( MDD ) also take prescription sleep-aids . Several controlled trial document effectiveness combine hypnotic antidepressant order improve disorder sleep MDD , unclear benzodiazepine relate drug cause worsen depression . A recent study nightly administration benzodiazepine-like hypnotic zolpidem ( Ambien® ) add SSRI citalopram demonstrate depressive symptom improve combination treatment , regimen also worsen symptom clinically significant manner . However , adverse event report trial -- -although limited -- -confirm number case report document psychiatric incident relate drug combination , account suggest collectively potential exists zolpidem-antidepressant interaction . Within brain , SSRIs believe exert action primarily cortical region increase GABA level . Conversely , others show zolpidem conventional benzodiazepine reduce GABA level thalamus occipital cortex , respectively . Moreover , zolpidem-induced reduction GABA accompany increase self-reported rating generally unpleasant aversive-like subjective feeling , suggest relationship may exist . A possible implication find administration benzodiazepine-like drug SSRI treatment may exacerbate negative affect depress mood state counter restorative effect SSRIs dysfunctional GABA MDD . The present study begin address hypothesis employ proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1H MRS ) field strength 4 Tesla ass effect therapeutic dose zolpidem ( 10 mg ) administer acutely volunteer maintain stable SSRI treatment treatment MDD . The primary aim study outline protocol investigate drug-induced change 1H MRS-visible pool GABA single voxels locate within anterior cingulate thalamus follow acute administration zolpidem relative placebo depress volunteer . The secondary aim collect information regard subjective effect engender intervention . This information , conjunction data show treatment affect brain chemistry , help u understand neurobiological mechanism may contribute alteration mood state popular hypnotic combine stable SSRI treatment . A total 20 depressed otherwise healthy volunteer enrol McLean Hospital participate 2-visit ( 1 screen visit , 1 study visit ) single-blind , placebo-controlled study , double-scan study . Participants 21 40 year age , either male female , restriction regard ethnic background . Participants maintain stable SSRI therapy treatment MDD , meet DSM-IV criterion major psychiatric disorder ( include substance abuse and/or dependence ) . They report family history alcoholism , medical condition could affect drug disposition , take medication SSRIs . Participants also MRI scan contraindication ( include pregnancy ) . They must able provide inform consent . Volunteers visit laboratory screen visit s/he sign inform consent form , undergo physical psychiatric exam , well structural screen MRI . The second visit involve pre-study assessment , standard breakfast , questionnaire set , drug treatment , two scanning session , lunch . After baseline period participant answer computerized questionnaire , receive study medication ( 10 mg zolpidem placebo ) answer questionnaire . Just prior begin approximately 45-min scan session ( 45-min post-medication ) , participant transport 4T scanner wheelchair position within scanner . A small blood sample take scan . In afternoon , participant receive another treatment answer questionnaire . Just prior begin approximately 45-min scan session ( 45-min post-medication ) , participant transport 4T scanner wheelchair position within scanner . A second small blood sample take scan . The scan session follow hourly questionnaire set end 8-hr visit point participant take taxicab home . An exhaustive screening procedure ensure participant enter study contraindicate condition . All procedure perform expert specifically train respective area minimize risk , discomfort , adverse event . Participants well inform potential risk study . The informed consent form detail explicit . Participants provide unlimited time read consent study personnel review detail participant sign . In addition , participant opportunity ask question , , consent time study . Participants earn total $ 250 complete study .</detailed_description>
