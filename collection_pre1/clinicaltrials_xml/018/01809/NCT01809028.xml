	<brief_summary>This study test amount tissue , call `` cell block '' , obtain pancreas . Patients ask participate study growth ( mass ) pancreas need biopsy diagnosis make . Although usually perform 2 4 pass ( number time doctor biopsy mass ) , time know ideal number pass need obtain adequate amount tissue make diagnosis . The purpose study compare amount tissue obtain 2 pass versus 4 pass .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A RT Evaluating Number Passes Required Diagnositc Cell Block During EUS-FNA Solid Pancreatic Mass Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Aim : To compare number pass require obtain adequate cell block material EUS-guided FNA solid pancreatic mass lesion . Primary Research Hypothesis : More specimen require obtain definitive diagnosis cell block . This translate less need repeat procedure ( due nondiagnostic index procedure due inadequate FNA pass ) , prompt treatment patient well use health care resource . Therefore , compare 2 versus 4 FNA pass determine number FNA pases yield adequate diagnostic cell block . Secondary Aims : To compare rate complication perform 2 versus 4 EUS-FNA pass solid pancreatic mass lesion . Secondary Research Hypothesis : EUS-guided FNA safe procedure complication rate &lt; 1 % . By perform ( four ) NA pass one likely yield well quality cell block time without compromise patient safety .</detailed_description>
