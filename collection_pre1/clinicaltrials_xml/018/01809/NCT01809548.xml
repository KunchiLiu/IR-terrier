	<brief_summary>Introduction : Preterm infant birth weight less 1500 gram special nutritional need comparison full-term neonate . During stay neonatal intensive care unit increase supply energy , protein electrolyte necessary establish adequate growth . After discharge hospital special breast milk supplement post discharge formula available cover special nutrient requirement . Complementary feed preterm infant unexplored field far nutritional concept first year life available . Data concern optimal time start solid food miss well information concern ideal composition complementary food . In context essential meet special nutritional need `` Ex-Preemies '' one hand avoid overfeeding later obesity hand . So far remain unclear , `` safe '' time point introduction solid food premature infants whether time point influence growth , body composition , neurodevelopmental outcome incidence atopic disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim : In prospective , randomize , two arm intervention study- PIES project- aim investigate impact different time point introduction complementary food growth , body composition , atopic disease neurodevelopmental outcome preterm infant birth weight &lt; 1500 gram . Furthermore , want investigate whether certain standardized feeding protocol meet nutritional need premature infant , obtain data safety efficacy context . Methods : At term infant stratify accord breastfed formula feed randomize one follow group : EARLY complementary feeding group ( introduction complementary food 10th 12th week life correct term , n=76 ) LATE complementary feed group ( introduction complementary food 16th 18th week life correct term , n=76 ) . The infant feed standardized complementary food addition formula breastfeed one year correct prematurity . In age dependent step concept , food box deliver parent : five type standardize food box manifold complementary food accord infant ' age ability tolerate small piece available child study . The standardized complementary feed regimen allow calculate exact intake nutrient therefore provide information concern primary secondary outcome . The follow phase last 5 year age . Within regular visit anthropometric data ( height , head circumference weight ) body composition via PeaPodÂ® system gather . Data atopy assess clinical scoring system SCORAD ( SCORing Atopic Dermatitis ) laboratory parameter Fx5 ( Fx5 test use six food allergen : wheat , egg , cow 's milk , soya , peanut fish ) IgE ( immuneglobulineE ) . Neurodevelopmental outcome assess age one two year correct term Bayley Scales K-ABC ( Kaufman Assessment Battery Children ) . The nutritional concept monitor concern short term safety efficacy ( bone metabolism , iron status , protein- lipid status ) well regard long term outcome ( diabetes obesity marker IGF-1 ( Insulin-like growth factor-1 ) leptin ) . With PIES project intend close gap knowledge feed premature infant first year life understand impact complementary feeding growth , atopy , neurodevelopmental outcome later obesity .</detailed_description>
