	<brief_summary>Background : - Rates diabetes heart disease woman increase . Early recognition risk could help woman live long healthy life . Race ethnicity may affect best kind test use screen condition . Researchers want compare risk factor diabetes heart disease African , African-American , white woman . Doing may help identify effective screen test group . This study look healthy African , African-American , white woman federal employee contractor . Objectives : - To study risk factor diabetes heart disease African , African-American , white woman . Eligibility : - Healthy African , African-American , white woman 30 65 year age federal employee contractor . - For study , African woman must bear Africa immigrated United States , report parent Africans . African-American woman must self-identify African-Americans , bear United States , parent self-identify African-American born United States . White woman must self-identify white parent also self-identify white . Design : - Participants four visit study risk factor diabetes heart disease . - The first visit screen visit . Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . They also EKG test . Participants also show fill 3-Day Food Record wear activity monitor call accelerometer . The food record keep track much participant eat 3 consecutive day , include 1 non-working day . The accelerometer device wear 3 day monitor movement . - At second visit , participant blood test , oral glucose tolerance test , body fat measurement . They also fill questionnaire , review food record , two image study . - At third visit , participant longer glucose tolerance test . During test , participant receive glucose insulin blood sample collect several hour . Participants receive lunch clinical center test . - At fourth visit , participant meal test . They fast 12 hour test . Participants eat specific meal blood sample take eat . - Participants discuss result test study doctor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>African-American woman experience disproportionately high rate condition related insulin resistance , specifically type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . In Africa , T2D CVD also become leading cause death woman . Early recognition risk implementation preventive measure could improve quality life longevity well decrease health care expenditures . However , screen test early detection T2D CVD develop several decade ago large study mostly white participant . Emerging evidence suggest racial difference ability importance various risk factor predict development diabetes CVD . Consequently test use screen T2D CVD often effective woman African descent . Thus , woman African descent lose opportunity benefit early intervention . Designing test determine risk T2D CVD woman African descent require appreciation current test work . Screening test detect risk T2D CVD usually rely observation insulin resistance associate increase hepatic fat , high fast glucose high triglyceride ( TG ) level . However , insulin-resistant white woman usually high liver fat , high fast glucose high TG level , insulin-resistant African-American woman often normal TG level , normal fast glucose low hepatic fat . Therefore , test routinely fail detect risk African-American woman . The relationship TG level insulin resistance , hepatic glucose production liver fat studied African woman . To improve diagnosis , propose study race difference TG level , fast glucose level hepatic fat compare 3 group woman federal employee contractor : African-American African ( bear subSaharan Africa immigrate United States ) white . This design ensure enrollees health insurance , similar work environment comparable distribution position ( i.e . scientific , administrative , support ) . Analyses detect difference diet , physical activity psychosocial factor undertake . There 4 outpatient visit 360 non-diabetic woman ( 120 African-American , 120 African 120 white , age 25 65 year , BMI 20 45 kg/m2 ) enrol . At Visit 1 , medical history , physical exam screen labs do . Participants record food intake monitor physical activity wear activity monirot ( accelerometer ) 7-day period visit . At Visit 2 oral glucose tolerance test perform . Studies examine body fat content distribution also do . At Visit 3 , insulin resistance measure intravenous glucose tolerance test . At Visit 4 , breakfast eaten blood sample take meal . In addition 4 outpatient visit describe , optional overnight stay even visit 3 60 woman ( 30 African descent 30 white ) . The purpose small study determine race difference production glucose liver contribute race difference fast glucose level . Eligible woman good health , 25 50 year age BMI 25-45kg/m2 . This study first time ( ) TG level African immigrant compare African-American white woman ( b ) hepatic glucose production assess race , ( c ) relationship TG insulin resistance , liver fat , body fat distribution , diet , physical activity psychosocial factor examine 3 group woman similar metabolic economic condition . While failure screen test mean lose opportunity early intervention , effective screening test change outcomes , improve life minimize health care expenditures . This protocol build foundation effective screening test diabetes heart disease build .</detailed_description>
