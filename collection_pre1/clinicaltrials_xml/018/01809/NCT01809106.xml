	<brief_summary>Pain , neoplastic disease , symptom severe negative impact quality life patient high incidence , value around 70-90 % advanced metastatic stage . Than 20 year main reference pharmacological treatment cancer pain guideline produce World Health Organization ( WHO ) . This document show use opioid drug mainstay treatment , particular reference opioids `` major '' ( 3 rd step analgesic ladder ) . The 4 opioids commonly prescribe Italy ( oral morphine oxycodone , fentanyl buprenorphine transdermal ) , base data currently available , analgesic effect would partly overlap different percentage non-responders ( NR ) , different need increase dose time maintain adequate analgesia , different action switch another molecule ineffectiveness analgesic . The observation describe suggest opioids , although belong family drug may fully comparable regard clinical effect product . Important difference know pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic , recently , also term pharmacogenomics . This comparative study analgesic strategy base use 4 mentioned opioids , go look possible difference term analgesic efficacy , change dose time , use switch permanent abandonment treatment , parallel contour side effect . The associated sub-project link structure gene patient clinical result emerge .</brief_summary>
