	<brief_summary>Endoscopic variceal ligation ( EVL ) prove effective prevention esophageal variceal rebleeding . However , optimal interval EVL remain unclear . Our previous study demonstrate repeat EVL every 3-4 week could achieve appreciable low incidence variceal rebleeding mortality . In opinion , many shallow post-EVL ulcer may hamper performance variceal ligation EVL perform interval 1-2 week . So far optimal treatment interval remain unknown .

	<brief_title>Monthly Versus Biweekly Endoscopic Variceal Ligation Prevention Esophageal Variceal Rebleeding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Esophageal varix important portosystemic collateral owe rupture result variceal hemorrhage , devastate event portal hypertension . Cirrhotic patient survive first episode variceal rupture risk 60 % suffer recurrent bleed within 1 year mortality rebleeding episode 20 % . Except patient terminal illness , secondary preventive measure require reduce variceal rebleeding improve patient survival clinical outcome . Endoscopic pharmacological therapy 2 main method intervention use achieve treatment goal . Endoscopic therapy contain endoscopic injection sclerotherapy ( EIS ) endoscopic variceal ligation ( EVL ) , would obliterate varix cause thrombosis fibrosis formation . However , EVL currently replace EIS endoscopic therapy choice safer , effective , low morbidity rate . Many expert scholar suggest repeat EVL every 1-2 week obliteration esophageal varix prevent variceal rebleeding , whereas , insufficient data support concept EVL interval 1-2 week appropriate . Our previous study demonstrate repeat EVL every 3-4 week could achieve appreciable low incidence variceal rebleeding mortality . In opinion , many shallow post-EVL ulcer may hamper performance variceal ligation EVL perform interval 1-2 week . A randomized control trial Japan show EVL perform bimonthly interval obtain high variceal obliteration rate , low variceal recurrence rate few additional treatment . Bimonthly EVL secondary prophylaxis variceal hemorrhage may theoretically improper post-EVL variceal rebleeding could significantly reduce variceal obliteration achieve within short treatment course . The retrospective investigation United States demonstrate principal technical aspect EVL prevention variceal rebleeding , suggest benefit intersession interval &gt; 3 week compare interval &lt; 3 week . This randomize control study undertaken compare effectiveness safety EVL two different intersession interval ( bimonthly vs. biweekly ) . In addition , risk factor associate variceal rebleeding mortality analyze .</detailed_description>
