	<brief_title>Sustainable Financial Incentives To Improve Prescription Practices For Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Global investment control malaria lead exciting reduction burden malaria . In area , malaria-related death drop 90 % . As malaria transmission decline , great fraction pediatric fever cause . However , fever continue treat malaria , often despite availability diagnostic testing . In typical rural health facility Kenya , 90 % febrile patient prescribe antimalarial diagnostic test available . Even microscopy rapid diagnostic test ( RDTs ) available , 50-80 % patient negative test nonetheless prescribe antimalarial . Inappropriately treated fever child lead serious consequence patient accelerate spread drug resistance . In addition risk patient , overuse antimalarial also put financial strain government health system . Although considerable incentive government reduce drug cost wastage , financial pressure experience appropriate level decision-making . This project aim test innovative , sustainable financial incentive design reduce number non-malarial fever treat inappropriately antimalarial drug . The study team test financial incentive target health facility determine improve adherence diagnostic result clinical protocol . Eighteen rural health facility Western Kenya enrol randomly allocate one two arm . The study team compare effectiveness clinical technical training diagnosis malaria alone ( Arm 1 ) training plus financial incentive link prescription practice ( Arm 2 ) improve diagnosis treatment malaria non-malaria fever . The practice prescribe antimalarial patient negative diagnostic compare facility without incentive structure . Secondary outcome include sensitivity specificity routine microscopy health center , use alternative treatment slide negative fever , frequency stock-outs antimalarial drug . This project tackle important implementation research problem . It seek test solution problem poor adherence evidence-based clinical guideline malaria treatment , thereby reduce inappropriate antimalarial drug use drug wastage . This project conduct collaboration Kenya 's Division Malaria Control avenues roll-out intervention , successful , actively explore .</detailed_description>
