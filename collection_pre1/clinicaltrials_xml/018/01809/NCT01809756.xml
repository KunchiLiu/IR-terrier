	<brief_summary>Rationale : In Netherlands 1731 people diagnose SCLC ( Small Cell Lung Cancer ) 2010 . This approximately 14 % new diagnosed lungcancers . Part need combination chemo-radiationtherapy . A review incidence severity esophagitis SCLC patient receive combination chemotherapy daily radiotherapy reveal overall esophagitis rate 58 % experience esophagitis grade 2 high . As concurrent radiotherapy move twice daily radiation ( 30 x 1,5 Gy 3 week ) expect incidence esophagitis rise , clinical symptom likely arise earlier become severe . Mucositis upper tractus digestivus serious adverse event lead pain , problem swallow decrease food intake . It negative infect QoL lead prolong hospital stay delay cancer treatment . Physicians seek improvement treatment modality improve daily patient toxicity . Caphosol® advance electrolyte solution indicate adjunct standard oral care treat oral mucositis cause radiation high dose chemotherapy . Positive effect Caphosol® oral rinse 4 time daily study head neck chemoradiation patient find presence mucositis oral comfort . It 's suppose pathogenesis chemo- radiotherapy induce mucositis whole tractus digestivus . The appearance differ due difference cell proliferation . Swallowing Caphosol® oral rinse could positive effect esophageal mucositis time onset , severity duration . Objective : Adding use Caphosol® ( rinse swallow four time day ) standard care esophagitis/mucositis , reduces incidence , onset , duration severity esophagitis SCLC patient , compare standard care alone . Study design : A multi-centre , open , randomized prospective phase II study . Study population : 108 patient 18 year old histologically prove SCLC ( histological subtypes ) , treat concurrent chemo- radiotherapy estimate include study ( 2:1 ratio inclusion ; 72 patient Caphosol® 36 patient without Caphosol® ; α=0.05 , power 80 % ) . Intervention ( applicable ) : 108 patient eligible study monitor SCLC chemo/radiotherapy treatment . One group 72 patient receive Caphosol® , 4 time day - next standard care . Caphosol® start day 1 treatment continue 3 week last radiotherapy ( RT ) .Another group 36 patient receive current standard care esophagitis . The patient randomly assign one group . Main study parameters/endpoints : The primary objective estimate incidence , onset , duration severity esophagitis SCLC patient undergo radiation therapy chemotherapy receive Caphosol® . Secondary study parameters/outcome study ( applicable ) : 1 . To correlate component esophagitis data clinical outcome ( pain , dysphagia , analgetic use , oral intake , weight loss , infection , need hospitalization , QoL ) 2 . Discontinuation delay chemotherapy due esophagitis . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : The risk small . The patient fill Esophagitis Daily Questionnaire regular visit QOL questionaires perform . Sputumswabs collect weekly basis determination microbiological flora mouth . During regular blood control max . 8 ml extra blood take immunologic status research . Caphosol® saturate calciumphosphate solution . The daily intake calcium phosphor swallow Caphosol® 4 time daily far beyond Acceptable Daily Intake ( ADI ) ( &lt; 5 % ) . Compared daily nutrient like milk ( 270 mg calcium per unit milk ( 225 ml ) ) meat ( 200 mg phosphor per 100 g meat ) intake calcium phosphor due Caphosol® negligible consider safe .</brief_summary>
