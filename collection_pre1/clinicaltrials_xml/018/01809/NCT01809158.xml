	<brief_summary>Schizophrenia understand heterogeneous brain condition overlap symptom dimension . The negative symptom dimension , protean cognitive manifestation , respond poorly treatment , particular challenge country clozapine therapy available . Preliminary data indicates minocycline may beneficial adjunct treatment schizophrenia : positive , negative , cognitive symptom . Persons schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder recent onset schizophrenic episode recent relapse prescribe minocycline addition standard antipsychotic medication show great symptom reduction , measure Positive Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) total score .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Minocycline Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Minocycline excellent penetration blood-brain barrier . In mechanism seem distinct antimicrobial property , minocycline anti-inflammatory neuroprotective property . These property think related combination inhibition inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) ; caspase 1 3 ; p-38 mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) ; cytochrome C release ; cyclooxygenase-2 expression ; prostaglandin E2 formation ; microglial activation . Minocycline also report antiviral effect HIV antiprotozoal effect Toxoplasma gondii . Its use individual schizophrenia encourage effect rodent model disorder . In one study , minocycline attenuate behavioral change follow administration NMDA ( N-methyl-D-aspartate ) antagonist mouse . In another study , minocycline reverse effect NMDA antagonist rat . Some preliminary data also suggest minocycline may useful patient schizophrenia . Two case report series publish , one include two patient schizophrenia include three patient recent-onset acute paranoid schizophrenia . An open label study 22 patient treatment-resistant schizophrenia , use minocycline 150 mg/d four week , report improvement positive negative symptom . Two double blind trial carry . In one study , 73 patient schizophrenia less five year ' duration randomize minocycline 200 mg placebo 12 month : `` symptom measure improve significantly '' especially negative symptom . In study , 54 `` early phase '' ( symptom less five year ) patient randomize minocycline 200 mg/d placebo six month ; author report significant improvement negative symptom measure use Scale Assessment Negative Symptoms ( SANS ) Clinical Global Impressions scale ( CGI ) significant improvement test executive function . These initial finding encourage replication . First , study comparatively small size . Second , country like Ethiopia option treatment schizophrenia limit , identify safe alternative clozapine important . Related , patient limit exposure psychotropic medication . Third , exposure alcohol substance generally believe low Ethiopian setting . Finally , give hypothesis infectious agent cause schizophrenia may important low middle income country ( LAMICs ) Ethiopia , minocycline may prove useful . In regard , trial help explore etiology schizophrenia . The investigator experience following-up large cohort patient schizophrenia conduct randomize control trial similar nature , make propose study feasible .</detailed_description>
