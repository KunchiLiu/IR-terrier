	<brief_title>Reversal With Sugammadex From Deep Neuromuscular Blockade Induced Rocuronium Children : Randomised Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Muscle relax facilitates endotracheal intubation surgical access . Muscle relaxant long duration possibility residual muscle relaxation surgery ( 40 % patient ) , ventilatory problem ( hypoxia , hypercapnia , atelectasis , airway collapse ) raise postoperative morbidity mortality . All fact accentuate pediatric patient due reduce airway caliber tend lead obstruction bronchospasm . So far , effect muscle relaxant partially reverse anticholinesterase ( neostigmine ) , limitation short duration action ( 8-9 minute ) many side effect ( bradycardia , hypotension , increased salivation , vomit , dyspnea bronchoconstriction ) . It also need combine anticholinergic ( atropine ) , cause dry mouth , blur vision tachycardia . At present , introduction sugammadex ( BridionÂ® ) , antagonist nondepolarizing neuromuscular relaxant rocuronium , may lead extraordinary breakthrough . It antagonist able encapsulate fully eliminate muscle relaxant avoid residual effect respiratory complication . Muscle strength retrieve time , without wait relaxant metabolism ( 30 40 minute ) without use usual classical antidote ( neostigmine atropine ) , produce many undesirable effect become troublesome postoperatory phase . Sugammadex lack intrinsic activity consider safe , without significant side effect use cardiovascular respiratory disease .</detailed_description>
