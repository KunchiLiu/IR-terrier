	<detailed_description>Specific Aims Retrospective study establish strong correlation report life stress depression . Investigators begin explore relationship examine role gene x stress interaction pathogenesis depression . In recent landmark study , Caspi colleague ( 2003 ) report interaction serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism life stress development depression . This finding replicate follow study . Despite initial promise result , ability draw definitive conclusion compromise significant study design limitation : 1 ) retrospective design 2 ) focus acute rather chronic stress 3 ) substantial variation character intensity stress subject . Medical internship period fill predictable high level chronic uncontrolled stress . Rates depression among intern elevate compare general population . In study , aim utilize predictable consistent stress internship investigate relationship stress , gene depression prospective study design bypass pitfall previous study . Goal 1 ) Assess prevalence development depression among medical intern Although small study assess point prevalence depression among medical resident , study prospectively follow development depressive symptom residency . We collect baseline psychological profile incoming intern prior commencement residency duty subsequently assess depressive symptom 3-month interval throughout internship . This data allow u : 1 . Assess point prevalence depression among intern large sample . 2 . Determine change depressive symptom course intern year 3 . Evaluate stable psychological factor associate development depression face life stress . Goal 2 ) Evaluate presence genotype x stress interaction among sample 1 . There conflict evidence concern presence interaction serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism ( 5-HTTLPR ) life stress development depression . We assess presence strength interaction sample medical intern use study design avoid many pitfall affect previous study . 2 . We explore novel putative interaction stress genetic variant additional gene include BDNF , CRH , COMT , serotonin 1A serotonin 2A receptor variant development depression . Goal 3 ) Evaluate relationship serum endothelial immune factor development depressive symptom stress . The identification biomarkers predict onset depression facilitate timely accurate identification individual high risk disorder . Unfortunately appropriate study lack , largely difficult know exactly depressive episode occur . Medical internship represent rare situation prospectively predict cohort individual shift shift low stress environment high stress environment thus predict cohort experience dramatic increase depressive symptom . Goal 4 ) Examine temporal relationship hair cortisol level , stress exposure development depressive symptoms.A novel technique allow u assess chronic HPA axis activity measure cortisol grow hair , provide integrate measure total cortisol secretion extend period time ( 1-3 month ) . By incorporate novel method establish longitudinal study chronic stressor dramatically increase rate depression , unique opportunity determine ) whether cortisol level prior stress exposure predict risk depression response stressor ( b ) whether cortisol rise response stress exposure precede perhaps contributes development depressive symptom whether cortisol elevation depression develop symptom onset perhaps reflect consequence depression .</detailed_description>
