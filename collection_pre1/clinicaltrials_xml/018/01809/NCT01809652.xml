	<brief_summary>The purpose study gain real world , live implant experience remote implant support system . This system intend provide technical support device implant remote location telepresence ( audio video ) remote control . Specifically , goal study corroborate bench test , assess performance system , gain understanding workflow , customer experience , logistics . The intent remote support model provide support would typically provide local support person , remotely . As , remote support person would perform action local support person would routinely direction physician . This may involve observe patient data , provide technical support advice , perform test device reprogramming via remote control programmer .</brief_summary>
