	<detailed_description>Objective : To determine safety effectiveness intra-articular hyaluronan ( IAHA ) injection treatment symptomatic patellofemoral pain syndrome ( PFPS ) determine treatment provide incremental clinical benefit standard care patient diagnosis . Study Design : Two-arm , single-center , parallel , pragmatic , randomize , non-blinded , effectiveness trial Indication Use : For treatment adult patient Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome ( PFPS ) fail respond conservative treatment simple analgesic ( e.g . acetaminophen ) . Setting : University Teaching Hospital , Faculty Practice Subjects : Male female patient age 18-40 diagnosed symptomatic patellofemoral pain syndrome ( PFPS ) meet inclusion exclusion criterion . Approximately 68 subject enrol base power analysis sample size estimation . Methods : Patients sign informed consent randomize one two group : ( 1 ) Standard Care , ( 2 ) Standard Care plus Intra-articular hyaluronan ( IAHA ) administer course 3 consecutive weekly intra-articular injection . Standard Care define consist physical therapy , activity modification ( relative rest ) , and/or oral analgesic therapy . Upon enter trial , specific physical therapy ( PT ) protocol implement . Data capture study knee history symptom . Radiographic examination perform include weight-bearing anterior-posterior view knee flex 30 degree , lateral , sunrise view . The diagnosis PFPS base subject ' less 40 year age , occurrence chronic retropatellar pain absence pain-causing abnormality . Arthrocentesis perform intra-articular injection , synovial fluid collect visually inspected sign infection perform injection . The volume synovial fluid measure , sample retain biomarker analysis . A follow-up visit schedule approximately 3 month baseline visit , reevaluate patient condition . Study Duration : A period approximately 15 month anticipate time first patient enrol completion last patient visit . A final study report generate 18 month time point .</detailed_description>
