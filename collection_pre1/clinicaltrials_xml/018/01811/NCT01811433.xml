	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether Halo Index utility detect difference normal non-normal recovery patient first hour immediately follow major inpatient surgery . A small significant percentage patient undergo major surgery experience major life-threatening complication first 30 day follow surgery . The chance develop one complication increase size surgery severity patient 's preexist medical problem . It unknown whether fluctuation patient 's vital sign measure bodily function occur early recovery period associate postoperative complication . If , may possible predict increase risk complication base monitor early recovery period . This study make use Halo Index , compilation measure patient function collect non-invasive monitoring device . In addition heart rate , blood pressure , temperature , breathe rate , include measure dissolve oxygen blood , amount hemoglobin blood , parameter . Patients two additional non-invasive monitor attach stay hospital post-anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) . After patient discharge hospital , medical record review two time point : The first soon discharge . Normal recovery patient define require IV fluid , pain medication anti-emetic medication . Non-normal recovery include require transfusion blood product , airway intervention breathe tube , blood pressure medication , heart rhythm medication . The second chart review occur 30 day surgery . In review , presence absence follow event ascertain : rapid response team call , admission intensive care unit , infection , pneumonia , need transfusion 5 unit blood within three-day period , septic shock , need ventilation breathe tube , blood clot lung , kidney failure , coma , stroke , heart attack , death .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Halo Index Adaptive Alarm Thresholds During Routine PACU Inpatient Care : `` Normal '' vs. `` Non-normal '' Recovery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study define normal non-normal recovery patient post-anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) follow major inpatient surgery use Halo Index , measure derive physiologic parameter collect Patient SafetyNet system . Background Masimo develop series patient monitor design improve perioperative care . The Radical-7 pulse oximeter delivers accurate , artifact-rejecting pulse oximetry information , also configure measure hemoglobin level pleth variability index ( assessment adequacy fluid volume replacement ) . The rainbow Acoustic Respiration Monitor able document presence adequacy ventilation . These parameter combine SafetyNet Remote Monitoring system . With system , data individual patient monitor wireless transmit central station . When certain alarm threshold cross , system automatically notify caregiver . Use system post-operative floor show result significantly few rapid response team ( RRT ) call ICU admission compare routine care . As enhancement , Masimo develop Halo Index . The Halo Index calculate amalgamation SafetyNet parameter . The index provide global trend information patient 's overall physiologic status . Often patient deterioration occur time , subtle change appreciate trend analysis . Conceptually , Halo Index associate alarm improve patient care compare care base periodic human assessment routine monitoring . While SafetyNet Halo index intend use post-operative patient care floor relatively high patient-to-nurse staffing ratio , may well monitor utility PACU , great patient acuity . It quite possible Halo index able detect evidence `` mal-recovery '' PACU may allow intervention patient improve outcome . Before assessment benefit make , necessary define behavior Halo index `` normal '' recovery see index different characteristic patient whose PACU discharge delay medical reason require unusual medical intervention . In addition , significant percentage patient undergo major surgery experience morbidity first 30 day follow surgery . Major morbidity define occurrence one follow postoperative complication : organ space infection , pneumonia , unplanned intubation , pulmonary embolism , ventilator dependence 48 hour , acute renal failure , stroke/cerebral vascular accident neurologic deficit , coma 24 hour , cardiac arrest require cardiopulmonary resuscitation , myocardial infarction , transfusion 5 unit erythrocyte within 72 hour , sepsis/septic shock , mortality . The chance develop one morbid outcomes increase size surgery severity patient 's preexist medical problem , range less 1 % 50 % depend factor . It unknown whether perturbation early recovery parameter associate postoperative morbidity . If , may possible predict increase risk morbidity base monitoring early recovery period .</detailed_description>
