	<detailed_description>The investigator hypothesize combination agent increase baseline dopamine signaling ( amphetamine ) one reduce cocaine-induced dopamine release ( topiramate ) improve dopamine regulation associate improved cocaine use outcome . 99 subject two site meet criterion cocaine dependence , study inclusion exclusion criterion assign 14-week double-blind , placebo-controlled treatment trial . Subjects randomize receive either placebo MAS-ER topiramate . This proposal test hypothesis MAS-ER topiramate promote cocaine abstinence . Participants randomized combination medication arm dose titrate 60 mg MAS-ER daily ( 2 week ) 200 mg topiramate day ( 6 week ) maintain dose week 13 trial . During week 14 , participant taper medication . All participant receive supportive behavioral treatment emphasize study procedure adherence . Starting week one , patient receive incentive compliance study procedure escalate reinforcement schedule similar develop previously contingent urine result .
