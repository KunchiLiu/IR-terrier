	<brief_summary>Broad - examine result feed RS 3-5 year old rural Malawian child zinc homeostasis environmental enteropathy ( EE ) . Specific - 1 . To measure zinc status use dual zinc stable isotope assay administer resistant starch ( RS ) 20 child . 2 . To measure intestinal function use site-specific sugar absorption test administer RS 20 child . 3 . To determine relationship RS zinc homeostasis . 4 . To determine relationship RS environmental enteropathy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A total 20 ( 10 M , 10 F ) stunt rural Malawian child age 36-60 month study determine effect feed RS zinc homeostasis environmental enteropathy . These child high risk zinc deficiency environmental enteropathy demographic characteristic . Children first quantitative assessment zinc homeostasis child give 2 zinc stable isotope , one mouth another intravenously , follow stool urine collection 4 day . Zinc isotopes quantified feces urine , value use calculate primary outcome , net zinc balance . This follow assessment environmental enteropathy quantitatively measure use non-invasive site specific sugar absorption test , child drink 100 mL sugar solution urine collection follow . The quantity non-metabolizable sugar measure , ratio two sugar , lactulose mannitol , measure environmental enteropathy . Then child receive dietary supplement , corn starch modify reduce dietary absorption , 5 week , add phala . The RS standard food product use safely many million people several decade . After take RS 4 week zinc stable isotope test dual sugar absorption test repeat child see improve . These result offer preliminary data whether RS might use effectively large scale community alleviate zinc deficiency and/or environmental enteropathy .</detailed_description>
