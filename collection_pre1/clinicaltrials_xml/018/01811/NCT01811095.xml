	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE A number pressure make challenge learn robotic suture operating room include budgetary constraint necessitate near maximum operating room efficiency , concern patient safety , decrease trainee work hour . Robotic surgery novel surgical technique significantly decrease surgical morbidity compare open surgery . Robotic simulation technique enables skill acquisition robotic surgery without constraint operate room . The Mimic® dv-Trainer TM novel virtual reality robotic surgery simulator first become available 2007 . Further refinement development lead incorporation Mimic software da Vinci® Skills Simulator . This simulator show face validity ( appear realistic experienced surgeon ) construct validity ( surgeon experience robotic surgery score high less experienced surgeon perform simulation exercise ) . The impact train use da Vinci® Skills Simulator performance use actual surgical robot ( da Vinci® Surgical System ) start study . One study assess impact training use da Vinci® Skills Simulator performance three animal tissue base task use da Vinci® Si HD TM Surgical System ( Hung , A.J. , et al. , Concurrent predictive validation novel robotic surgery simulator : prospective , randomize study . Journal Urology , 2012 . 187 ( 2 ) : p. 630-7 ) . One three task assess suture closed hole injure animal bladder . This study show statistically significant improvement animal tissue exercise subgroup participant start score low 50th percent exercise . Our study differ study several way . First , focus select group simulation exercise focus robotic suturing ( six exercise rather seventeen ) . Second , develop proficiency curriculum rather one base time spent training . Third , primary outcome performance suturing , use actual surgical robot ( da Vinci® Surgical System ) , vaginal cuff model make inanimate material rather animal tissue model . Due logistic reason , suture inanimate model perform da Vinci® S Surgical System March 23rd test date ( pretest group 1 ) da Vinci® Si Surgical System April 27 test date ( pretest group 2 post-test 1 group 1 ) June 1 test date ( post-test group 2 post-test 2 group 1 control cross training May ) . Our study open trainee surgeon obstetrics gynecology , general surgery , urology , cardiac surgery rather urology . SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATIONS Our sample size calculation suggest need 38 participant , 19 group . This calculated use PASS 11 . The plan compare follow : ( ) control group score final evaluation minus control group score initial evaluation versus ( b ) training group score final evaluation minus train group score initial evaluation . Thus , assume two independent group ( difference control group independent difference train group ) . For sample size calculation , select Mann-Whitney test assume mean difference improvement score train group versus improvement score control group 7 ( context maximum possible score 70 possible evaluation ) . We also assume standard deviation difference 7 , alpha 0.05 , power 0.8 . The non-parametric Mann-Whitney test ( equivalent Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test ) compare ranks independent group forms basis estimate . If look sample size calculation pair mean ( example train group initial assessment versus post-training ) , calculate need sample size 16 training group ( 32 total control ) . The assumption difference mean , standard deviation , alpha beta error make . The Wilcoxon ( sign rank ) test compare rank two pair group form basis estimate . RANDOMIZATION AND ALLOCATION CONCEALMENT Randomization achieve online random number generator ( www.randomization.com ) create random sequence train versus control 40 participant use randomly permute block 4 6 ratio participant 1:1 train : control block . The randomization sequence generate associate otherwise involve study . The group assignment ( train control ) write associate index card piece carbon paper staple onto front index card place opaque , sequentially number , seal envelope opening participant order arrival pre-test day . Participants write name front envelope open transmit carbon paper index card . Two participant initially give consent participate condition would train give 5 week period change mind day pre-test agree randomize . DESIGN AND DESCRIPTION OF METHODOLOGY After obtain informed consent , participant undergo baseline test two domain : ( 1 ) virtual reality robotic simulation use da Vinci® Skills Simulator ( 2 ) robotic suture inanimate model use da Vinci® Surgical System . For test use da Vinci® Skills Simulator , participant perform follow task : Suture sponge 1 . Scoring do automatically built-in algorithm da Vinci® Skills Simulator . Baseline score da Vinci® Skills Simulator task obtain first train session . It due time constraint test day limit assessment da Vinci® Skills Simulator Suture Sponge 1 task alone . For baseline physical ( opposed virtual reality ) robotic simulation testing , participant suture vaginal cuff model use actual surgical robot , da Vinci® Surgical System . Due logistic reason , da Vinci® S Surgical System use test March 23 ( pre-test group 1 ) da Vinci® Si Surgical System use test April 27 ( post-test 1 group 1 pre-test group 2 ) June 1 ( post-test 2 group 1 control cross-over training period April 27 May 31 post-test group 2 ) . The vaginal cuff model build inexpensive inanimate material base prototype Journal Robotic Surgery [ Finan MA , C.M. , Rocconi , A novel method training resident robotic hysterectomy . Journal Robotic Surgery , 2010 . 4 ( 1 ) : p . 33-39. ] . Their performance task record use built-in video camera da Vinci® Surgical System . Participants give ten minute time limit try suture many figure 8 knot model vaginal cuff possible . They instruct place double throw three single throw knot . At study conclusion , one expert robotic surgeon one gynecologic oncology fellow , blind participant identity group randomization status , grade performance task . In order ensure blinding , videorecordings arrange random order member study team ( involved grade performance ) way content lose sequence participant suture whether pre- post-intervention record randomly arrange use random number generator . The original study code also remove random sequence videos new study code attach video . A master sheet keep re-assign original code available evaluator grade complete . To score videotaped performance , grade perform use GOALS score laparoscopy [ Vassiliou , M.C. , et al. , A global assessment tool evaluation intraoperative laparoscopic skill . American Journal Surgery , 2005 . 190 ( 1 ) : p . 107-13 . ] plus two additional metric describe AJ Hung [ Hung , A.J. , et al. , Concurrent predictive validation novel robotic surgery simulator : prospective , randomize study . Journal Urology , 2012 . 187 ( 2 ) : p . 630-7 . ] specifically robotics : 1 ) precision 2 ) instrument camera awareness . Following initial test , participant randomize two group : 1 ) participation da Vinci® Skills Simulator-based robotic suture simulation proficiency curriculum addition usual clinical/residency practice 2 ) usual clinical/residency practice alone . The robotic suturing simulation curriculum `` proficiency '' curriculum focus goal achieve proficiency target five six task include curriculum . Those five task : Camera target 1 , Camera target 2 , Suture sponge 1 , Suture sponge 2 , Suture sponge 3 . For five exercise , use late version MScore TM assessment . MScore TM part software accompany da Vinci® Skills Simulator provide scoring task performance . We ask participant train group aim complete exercise target score ( overall score green checkmark , equivalent `` complete score '' ) two nonconsecutive attempt . For `` Suturing skill ( Symbionix TM ) : Horizontal suturing defect '' task , score different adjusts participant 's prior attempt , indicate whether improvement make . Thus , elect ask participant aim complete task ten time , rather aim particular score . The curriculum designate `` proficiency-based '' ( exception Horizontal suturing defect task ) goal achieve target score rather complete set amount time training set number repetition . However , provide structure , recommend least five hour total training session five week study period . We also facilitate organization schedule additional training time study period , desire individual participant train group . In term simulator access , participant train group use da Vinci® Skills Simulator attach mentor console da Vinci Si robot . This da Vinci® Si robot use actual surgery regular working hour . In general Monday-Friday regular , elective surgery schedule . Thus , da Vinci® Skills Simulator , general ( unless elective robotic case cancel scheduled day ) , available participant elective robotic surgery day complete week day . On Saturday Sunday , da Vinci® Skills Simulator generally available participant day . The control group carry regular clinical work residency training . After intervention period , re-evaluate participant da Vinci® Skills Simulator task ( Suture Sponge 1 ) task suture vaginal cuff model use da Vinci® S Surgical System . Testing task suture vaginal cuff model use da Vinci® Surgical System grade manner pretesting : one expert robotic surgeon , one surgeon intermediate robotic experience , one gynecologic oncology fellow ( blinded participant group whether task perform pre- post-intervention ) review videotape recording . { *Note initially plan video grade one expert robotic surgeon one gynecologic fellow . We decide add grade one surgeon intermediate robotic experience . This decision make ensure least two set grade complete group 's deadline Sept 11th , strengthen validity result , allow well assessment inter-observer agreement . The decision add third rater make first set data ( expert robotic surgeon ) data decode analyzed ( know whether score apply participant pre- post- training control group ) . The first complete set video grade receive Aug 4 ( expert robotic surgeon ) , second set Sept 8 ( gynecologic oncology fellow ) , third set Sept 10 ( surgeon intermediate robotic experience ) . On Sept 11 , process decode randomize order data begin link score whether participant pre- post-intervention control group train group reveal order begin analysis . } Following , control group start March 23rd allow crossover perform proficiency-based curriculum . Finally , group ( originally control , cross training ) test one last time simulation task `` Suture Sponge 1 '' use da Vinci® Skills Simulator task robotic suture vaginal cuff model use da Vinci® Surgical System . The robotic suturing vaginal cuff model assess review videotape blind expert . In order organize training session participant give investigator 's contact information ( DK ) . Access da Vinci® Skills Simulator organize proctor familiar da Vinci® Skills Simulator ( DK ) , present facilitate access simulator ( give locate operate room ) supervise . There two separate date participant enter study randomize . They : March 23 April 27 , 2013 . Participants enter study March 23 pretesting day randomize training March 24 April 26 April 28 - May 31 , 2013 . All participant enter study March 23 ask participate posttest April 27 , 2013 . Those participant randomize train April 29 May 31 ( , initial control group participant elect crossover train next period ) ask participate second post-test June 1 , 2013 . Participants enter study April 27 , 2013 pretest day randomize training April 29 May 31 control optional training June 2 June 28 . All participant enter study April 27 ask participate post-test June 1 , 2013 . Those participant enter study April 27 randomize control group April 28 May 31 option crossover complete training June 2-28 . However , present , post-test plan training period ( June 2 - 28 ) due logistic reason . DATA ANALYSIS PLAN There three time period two entry point ( March 23 April 27 ) study : time 0 = initial testing ; time 1 = post-intervention period ; time 2 = post-cross-over intervention period . To clarify , time 1 occur time retesting follow initial study period train training . Time 2 occur control group cross , complete training , retested . A subgroup analysis participant start pretest score low 50 % plan . Independent group comparison also conduct use Wilcoxon rank sum test . Independent group comparison include ( ) difference time 0 time 1 training group versus ( b ) difference time 0 time 1 control group . Paired group comparison conduct Wilcoxon sign rank test . Paired group comparison include : training group time 0 versus time 1 control group cross-over training time 2 versus time 1 time 1 versus time 0 .</detailed_description>
