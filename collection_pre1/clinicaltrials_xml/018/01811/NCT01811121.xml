	<brief_summary>Glioblastoma frequent primary malignant brain tumor adult ( 3,000 new case per year ) characterize poor prognosis ( median survival 12 month ) . Treatment base mainly surgical excision complete possible follow additional radiochemotherapy . The prognosis depend mainly quality resection macroscopically complete . Different technique support surgical resection develop past 20 year . The reference technique currently intraoperative neuronavigation guide excision match intraoperative tumor boundary preoperative MRI . Its main drawback loss precision resection relate change anatomical limit tumor . The per-operative fluorescence-guided surgery ( FGS ) innovative alternative technique support surgical resection . The 5-aminolevulinic acid ( 5-ALA ) , molecule absorb patient surgery capture specifically tumor cell transform fluorochrome reveal intraoperatively light source length adapt wave set lens include microscope . Resection thus guide fluorescence whose disappearance translate complete tumor resection . Its interest twofold : - Increase percentage complete tumor resection . - Improve disease-free survival overall survival . The objective study compare FGS intraoperative neuronavigation resection glioblastoma , medical economical level randomize , prospective , multicenter trial . The annual number patient likely benefit technique France estimate 2200 new case .</brief_summary>
