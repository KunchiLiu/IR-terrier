	<brief_summary>The common treatment men high risk prostate cancer radiation therapy ( XRT ) follow long term androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) . Long-term AD toxic , substantial metabolic , physical , mental sexual side-effects . In study , investigator propose treatment strategy optimize control high risk prostate cancer use dose-escalated external beam radiation ( proton therapy IMRT ) concurrent docetaxel adjuvant short-course AD . The investigator hypothesize approach superior current standard care obviate need long term AD . In study , subject randomize either XRT long term ADT XRT chemotherapy short term ADT .</brief_summary>
