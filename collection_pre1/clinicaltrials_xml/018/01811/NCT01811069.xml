	<brief_summary>Upper airway obstruction ( UAO ) induction general anesthesia frequently occur complication . The mechanism UAO anesthesia share many similarity upper airway obstruction observe obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . Obesity major risk factor OSA obese patient higher prevalence UAO anesthesia . The change body position improve upper airway stability sleep patient OSA.We hypothesis 30Ëš reverse trendelenburg body position maintain airway patency obese patient general anesthesia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , observational study . Fifteen subject BMI limit range 30 kg/m2 50 kg/m2 , 18-65 year age meeting ASA physical status classification I-III require general anesthesia elective surgery recruit main operating room Massachusetts General Hospital . We start recruit process least 12 hour ahead surgery pre-admission test area . The PI/Co-I approach potential subject express interest anesthesiologist provide anesthesia care subject . In addition PI/Co-I approach patient reinforce participate decision participate affect care anytime . The Principal Investigator Co-Investigator participate inform consent process operative hold area . Subjects recruit give thorough review informed consent , well study purpose procedure , risk , discomfort , potential benefit . When subject comfortable knowledgeable protocol , sign consent form presence investigator . Investigator also sign informed consent form . All subject give ample time read consent form consider participate trial . Any complaint problem relate recruitment plan report real time IRB .</detailed_description>

Patients major cardiovascular disease , respiratory disease , cerebral vascular disease American Society Anesthesiologists physical status class IV great . 2 . Abnormal vital sign day admission surgery [ heart rate ( HR , &gt; 100 bpm &lt; 40 bpm ) , blood pressure ( BP , &gt; 180/100 mmHg &lt; 90/60 mmHg ) , room air transcutaneous oxyhemoglobin saturation ( SPO2 ) &lt; 96 % ] correctable routine medication commonly use preoperative medication . 3 . Having claustrophobia able tolerate mask . 4 . Any person anticipate difficult airway history difficult airway require fiberoptic intubation awake . 5 . Gastricesophageal reflex disease refractory treatment full stomach . 6 . The subject bed 24 hour . 7 . Neurological symptom associate neck extension , neurological deficit previous stroke spinal cord injury , recent stroke transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) within 2 week . 8 . Pregnant woman woman less one month postpartum . Ruling pregnancy conduct careful history physical examination perform routinely prior surgery . If history believe unreliable , patient exclude unless pregnancy test perform result test negative . 9 . Emergency case subject adhere ASA NPO ( Nil Per Os ) guideline .</criteria>
