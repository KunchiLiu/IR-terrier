	<brief_summary>The high-grade malignant brain tumor , glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) , comprise majority primary brain tumor adult . This group tumor also exhibit aggressive behavior , result median overall survival 9-12 month . Initial therapy consist either surgical resection , external beam radiation , . All patient experience recurrence first-line therapy , improvement first-line salvage therapy critical enhance quality-of-life prolonging survival . It unknown currently use intravenous ( IV ) therapy even cross blood brain barrier ( BBB ) . We show previous phase I trial single Superselective Intraarterial Cerebral Infusion ( SIACI ) Bevacizumab ( 15mg/kg ) safe effective treatment recurrent GBM . Therefore , phase I/II clinical research trial extension trial seek test hypothesis repeat dose intra-arterial Bevacizumab safe effective treatment newly diagnose malignant glioma . By achieve aim study also determine repeat intra-arterial Bevacizumab improve progression free overall survival newly diagnose patient . We expect project provide important information regard utility repeat SIACI Bevacizumab therapy malignant glioma , may alter way drug deliver patient near future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Repeated Super-Selective Intraarterial Cerebral Infusion Bevacizumab ( Avastin ) Treatment Newly Diagnosed GBM</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The experimental aspect experimental plan include : 1 . Subjects first treat Mannitol prior chemotherapy infusion ( Mannitol 20 % ; deliver IA , 12.5 mL 2 minute ) order disrupt blood brain barrier . This technique use several thousand subject previous study IA delivery chemotherapy malignant glioma . 2 . Subjects treat repeat intraarterial delivery ( SIACI ) Bevacizumab . Each subject receive one dose IA Bevacizumab day 30 , follow chemoradiation . SIACI Bevacizumab repeat every three month total 3 infusion .</detailed_description>
