	<brief_title>An Interventional Study Assess Efficacy Safety Oxycodone/Naloxone Korean Patients With Spinal Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design ( Methodology ) : This multicenter , phase IV , interventional study ass efficacy safety TARGIN ( R ) ( Oxycodone/Naloxone ) Korean patient dissatisfied current analgesic medication ( WHO step II analgesic ) . Upon provide write informed consent , subject screen study assessment perform time safety laboratory assessment , physical examination , vital sign , medical history taking , 24 hour pain intensity score , EQ-5D , physician 's overall satisfaction subject 's overall satisfaction . If patient eligible inclusion/exclusion criterion time visit 1 , patient receive treatment TARGIN ( R ) . Re-screening , study drug dose interruption allow . The duration study drug dose interruption define 1 week . Treatment TARGIN ( R ) start 5/2.5mg b.i.d. , proper titration ( titration ) allow visit unscheduled visit accord investigator 's decision . On-site visit phone call allow visit 2 ( wk 1 ) .The titration consider investigator 's judgement following ; ( 1 ) rescue medication use 2 time per day , average ( 2 ) base daily average numerical rating scale , numerical rating scale change worsen since previous visit , ( 3 ) Investigator 's judgement consider titration need situation ( e.g . dose , frequency rescue medication ) . Pain assessment investigator visit use analysis criterion uptitration . Daily pain diary use criterion uptitration . Safety laboratory obtain baseline ( visit 1 ) study end ( visit 4 ) local laboratory . The laboratory value within 4 week prior baseline ( visit 1 ) allow use study visit 1 . The rescue medication IRcodon ( R ) . Patients withdraw study follow circumstance require study drug discontinuation : - Failure pain control ( Failure pain control decide investigator judgement , e.g . poor pain control lack efficacy despite 2~3 time titration . ) - Adjustment analgesic due Adverse event except TARGIN ( R ) IRcodon ( R ) - Adjustment major pain management modality ( e.g . surgery , non-surgical interventional therapy , etc . ) - Withdrawal informed consent - Pregnancy - Any significant risk patient 's safety clinical judgement investigator</detailed_description>
