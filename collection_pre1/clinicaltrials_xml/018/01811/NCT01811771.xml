	<brief_summary>Background : Vibrio cholerae one major cause severe diarrheal disease Bangladesh . It estimate 450,000 cholera case year Bangladesh . Cholera prevalent urban rural setting country . Policy decision best new public health tool incorporate system require evidence . Investigators recently carry feasibility study oral cholera vaccine urban Dhaka Mirpur ( Protocol # 10061 ) . However , whether similar system also utilized rural area Bangladesh need study . The hospital disease surveillance data International Centre Diarrhoeal Disease Research , Bangladesh ( icddr , b ) reveal substantial burden cholera Keraniganj upazila . Investigators propose feasibility study oral cholera vaccination use exist national immunization service delivery mechanism Keraniganj . This study help provide evidence policy maker introduce oral cholera vaccine prevent cholera high risk rural area Bangladesh . Hypothesis : That icddr , b collaboration Government Bangladesh able implement oral cholera vaccine program ; 1. reach resident rural union Keraniganj 2. reduces incidence diarrhea due Vibrio cholerae Objectives : 1 . Carry cholera vaccination one rural union Keraniganj . 2 . Evaluate impact vaccination reduce cholera study area Methods : Two union Keraniganj select ; around 30,000 individual one union vaccinate impact evaluate comparison another similar union . After vaccination , passive cholera surveillance Upazila hospital conduct two year patient two union . Outcome measures/variables : Cholera vaccination programme assess number dos administer , drop-out rate two round , proportion vaccine wastage , vaccine coverage . Proportion diarrheal hospitalization due V. cholerae O1 vaccinate non vaccinate union calculate compare assess impact intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study two select rural cholera endemic union Keraniganj Upazila near Dhaka city continue two half year . The study two major components- 1 . Feasibility intervention oral cholera vaccine one union ; , 2 . Impact evaluation intervention prospective passive surveillance diarrheal patient come two select union upazila health complex . For cholera vaccination male non-pregnant female resident one year age target vaccination select union . Investigators exclude less one year child pregnant woman form vaccination . For surveillance part standardize questionnaire administer consented diarrheal patient guardian order obtain information diarrhea , health demographic issue . Stool sample co llected tested V. cholerae O1 O139 . Investigators , purposively , select Keraniganj Upazila Dhaka study area due high incidence diarrhea evidence culture confirm cholera close proximity Dhaka . Based Keraniganj diarrheal disease report evidence cholera prevalence icddr , b surveillance data , Ruhitpur union approximately thirty thousand population select area vaccination , intervention union . To evaluate effectiveness intervention Investigators include Basta union Keraniganj non-intervention area . In select two union , make comparable , addition population size , evidence diarrhea cholera , Investigators consider closeness Upazila Health Complexes ( UHC ) , presence educational institute health facility , literacy rate , land area , etc . Investigators use kill whole cell oral cholera vaccine , `` Shanchol '' , manufacture Shantha Biotechnics study . The vaccine register India prequalified WHO . In urban Mirpur area investigator already successfully use 265,000 dos vaccine . Vaccines store EPI ( Expanded program immunization ) cold room 2-8 degree C. Based available space District upazila cold store , vaccine shift EPI cold room facility Dhaka . Investigators use rural health facility include community clinic vaccination site vaccinate catchment eligible targeted population . Investigators use exist EPI cold chain facility Keraniganj Upazila health complex deliver vaccine select union . During vaccination , vaccinator gently shake single dose vial well disperse suspension open feed content recipient . Adults old child take vaccine vaccinator fee vaccine content young child . Trained Community health care provider , Health Assistants Family Welfare assistants community clinic area act vaccinator . There adequate training concern prior vaccination programme . In addition , volunteer community recruit trained assist vaccination social mobilization activity . Investigators develop appropriate communication material inform population cholera vaccination opportunity . Local health facility , pharmacy community resident involve assist social mobilization population attend vaccination session . Persons one year age pregnant woman receive vaccine . People live adjacent union eligible receive vaccine , due limit number vaccine hand . Investigators clarify convince way field worker , community volunteers/leaders stakeholders everyone give intervention target approach unavailability vaccine study feasibility study test vaccine delivery mechanism rural setting . All patient study area Keraniganj Upazila Health Complex ( UHC ) diarrhoea include cholera surveillance . All study participant encourage attend Upazila health complex treatment diarrhoeal diseases initiation study time time remind field worker . A patient last 24 hour three loose liquid stool define case diarrhea ( 13 ) . The surveillance cholera Upazila health complex carry two year . As study implement passive surveillance unions- intervention control , see effectiveness intervention , key element capture case come two union . To , study convey message people two union utilize exist GoB ( Government Bangladesh ) facility upazila health complex diarrheal illness . Study provide card people two union contain message , distribute card field worker convey message tell bring card diarrheal illness Keraniganj UHC . The exist field health worker , worker health facility ( community clinic , health &amp; family welfare center ) encourage convey message refer diarrheal patient Keraniganj upazila health complex . The patient OPD ( patient department ) ORT ( oral rehydration therapy ) corner Keraniganj UHC include passive surveillance private clinics/hospital ( available agrees ) also take surveillance . Investigators collect stool rectal swab specimen diarrheal patient come study population diarrheal disease . Specimens evaluate V. cholerae O1and O139 accord WHO/CDC guideline icddr , b .</detailed_description>
