	<brief_summary>The main goal study present framework , integrate DNA , RNA tissue data identify prioritize genetic event represent clinically relevant new therapeutic target prognostic biomarkers different kind brain tumor . The investigator study regulation neoplastic cell growth oncogene , tumor-suppressor cancer relate gene use modern molecular genetic method , chromogenic-in-situ hybridization , comparative genomic hybridization ( CGH ) , array-CGH , cDNA microarray etc . In study investigator utilize disease-specific tissue microarrays ( TMA ) investigator construct since 1999 . Until 3000 different brain tumour sample TMA : s. These permit high-volume simultaneous analysis molecular target DNA , mRNA protein level . Research group also focus interest neoplastic development glioma , particularly hereditary environmental factor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aims study : 1 . To collect adequate brain cancer tissue material high throughput morphological , protein , RNA DNA analyse . 2 . To combine tissue-related result analyse clinical data examine potential new biomarkers assess diagnosis , prognosis heredity brain tumor . Materials Methods Paraffin-embedded tumor material Paraffin block 4,000 brain tumour collect Laboratory Pathology Tampere University Hospital ( Department Pathology Fimlab Laboratory ) . They use primarily purpose clinical diagnosis , patient authority consent obtain surplus material use research purpose . A neuropathologist marked representative region tumour tissue slide . Using marking , tumour tissue region biopsied tissue microarray block ( Micro-Array Technology , Beecher Instruments , Inc. ) . Up 1,000 histological sample collect one tissue microarray block , cut 200 tissue section . These section use various kind analysis ( immunohistochemistry , fluorescence chromogene situ hybridisation histological standing ) . Among advantage method high capacity , potential automation , limited damage original tissue block optimise circumstance molecular biological analysis . We produce first Finnish TMA block 1999 . Until 3000 different brain tumor sample TMA : 2000 glioma meningioma use study . The follow provide example project method use . Similar strategy use present study : 1 . We study relationship carbonic anhydrases brain tumour . Carbonic anhydrase IX ( CA IX ) hypoxia-induced enzyme associate tumorigenesis . CA IX immunopositivity find 80 % 362 astrocytic glioma collect tissue microarray block . According multifactorial survival analysis , CA IX intensity significant independent prognostic factor . CA IX possible candidate target therapy . 2 . By use cDNA-microarray method possible analyse expression several cancer gene one hybridisation . The cDNA-CGH microarray method make simultaneous use cDNA-microarray method comparative genomic hybridisation . This method allow u study relationship gene copy number expression particular amplify gene , also define , high resolution , gene cell line amplify over- express . The analysis give focused picture relationship change gene copy number expression different kind tumour . With method find several new cancer gene candidate may involve pathogenesis neuroblastomas . To ensure role gene build neuroblastoma tissue micro array block perform FISH IHC analyse use TMAs . We succeed characterise amplification region occur almost half tumour sample neuroblastoma patient significantly associate patient survival . Fresh tissue frozen tissue microarrays Our team Department Pathology take step prepare molecular biological genetic study require fresh tissue archive . To end systematically collect record brain tumour tissue modern method cancer diagnosis research . The processing , storage archive brain tumour tissue neurosurgical operation theatre Tampere University Hospital undertaken centrally Department Pathology frozen tissue laboratory . This work ongoing since 1992 1,000 fresh tumour sample collect . The sample material use exact tumour diagnosis phase primary diagnosis ( e.g . genetic 1p19q LOH analysis oligodendrogliomas ) . Our novel frozen tissue application serve several new molecular pathological method . We develop completely new method base snap frozen technique produce dozen sample different brain localisation ( frozen brain array ) . The follow provide one example project frozen tissue method use . Similar principle use present study : 3 . We develop new method facilitate differential diagnosis brain tumour operation . Using Ultrarapid Ki-67 staining method , proliferation marker Ki-67 analyse intraoperatively snap frozen technique light microscopy within 10 - 15 minute . We able ascertain applicability method use frozen tissue section gliomas previously collect tissue bank . On basis proliferation index , glioma could divide different malignancy grade prognosis group . This highly specific diagnostic method apply example situation therapeutic drug place intracranial operation field . Extracted RNA DNA Our laboratory well equipped prepared RNA DNA study . Following extraction , RNA DNA archive kept -700 C later use . Example project use method : 4 . Linkage analysis offer powerful tool localise gene predispose familial disease , provide sufficient number family disease concern . For linkage analysis , polymorphic region genome investigate use marker chromosomal region pass family 's founder parent member gliomas family . We collect blood DNA sample rare glioma family ( total 183 member ) purpose linkage analysis . On basis genome-wide linkage analysis , find new chromosome locus significantly associate familial glioma . Deep sequencing sample familial glioma patient follow step study . Data collection Our neuro-oncological material Tampere University Hospital Department Pathology comprise 5,000 tissue sample ( 4,000 paraffin 1,000 frozen tissue sample ) . This large dataset manage individual researcher database . Our aim therefore develop new integrate research data system effective management tissue material collect past 30 year , include detailed register sample . The register also include digital photo material TMA histological slide well virtual microscopy slide . The relevant clinical data patient ( e.g . least three year follow-up glioma meningioma patient operated 1983 - 2009 ) combine tissue data permission Finnish authority Tampere University Hospital . The project observe Helsinki Declaration , current Finnish legislation principle data protection , lay Tampere University Hospital . This study retrospective purely observational . The assignment medical intervention discretion investigator . The collection sample research purpose require individual patient 's informed consent familial glioma study . The archive diagnostic material tissue bank involve ethical problem . Only excess material diagnostic sample use research purpose , either patient 's informed consent permission relevant Finnish authority ( National Authority Medicolegal Affairs Finland ) . The Ethical Committee Tampere University Hospital give permission project ( R07042 ) . The familial glioma study conduct separate permit ( Ministry Social Affairs Health , Diary number 127/08/95 ) . Research permit also obtain basis Finnish tissue law ( Valvira : Diary number 7796/05.01.00.06/2011 ) .</detailed_description>
