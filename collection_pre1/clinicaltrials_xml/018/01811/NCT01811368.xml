	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well ibritumomab tiuxetan donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant work treat patient relapsed refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Giving rituximab , antithymocyte globulin , total-lymphoid irradiation ( TLI ) donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant help stop growth cancer cell help stop patient 's immune system reject donor 's stem cell . Also , radiolabeled monoclonal antibody , ibritumomab tiuxetan , find cancer cell carry cancer-killing substance without harm normal cell . When healthy stem cell donor infused patient may help patient 's bone marrow make stem cell , red blood cell , white blood cell , platelet . Sometimes transplanted cell donor make immune response body 's normal cell . Giving rituximab , antithymocyte globulin , TLI transplant together cyclosporine mycophenolate mofetil transplant may stop happen . Giving radiolabeled monoclonal antibody donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant may effective treatment non-Hodgkin lymphoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To measure response conversion ( progressive disease [ PD ] /stable disease [ SD ] partial response [ PR ] complete response [ CR ] ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess time engraftment/chimerism . II . To assess rate acute chronic graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) . III . To assess toxicity . IV . To determine overall survival . V. To investigate immune functional phenotypic analysis . VI . To measure two year event free survival ( EFS ) . OUTLINE : CONDITIONING REGIMEN : Patients receive rituximab intravenously ( IV ) day -21 14 , ibritumomab tiuxetan IV day -14 , TLI day -11 -7 -4 -1 , antithymocyte globulin IV 4-6 hour day -11 -7 . Patients also undergo TLI day -11 -7 -4 -1 . TRANSPLANT : Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplant ( PBSCT ) day 0 . GVHD PROPHYLAXIS : Patients receive cyclosporine orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) IV day -3 56 taper 6 month mycophenolate mofetil PO BID IV day 0-28 . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
