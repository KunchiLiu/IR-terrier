	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . The objective response rate , define proportion patient partial response ( PR ) complete response ( CR ) within first 6 month initiation therapy cabozantinib ( cabozantinib-s-malate ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess duration objective response , progression-free survival overall survival . II . To assess tolerability adverse event cabozantinib 2nd line therapy patient differentiate thyroid cancer ( DTC ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess effect cabozantinib serum tumor marker thyroglobulin correlation overall response rate . II . To assess response cabozantinib bone metastasis ( bone metastasis-specific progression free survival ) evaluate pre- on-study functional image bone scan , fludeoxyglucose F 18 ( 18F-FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan and/or 18F sodium fluoride ( NaF ) PET scan . III . To assess effect cabozantinib serum urinary marker bone turnover correlation response bone metastasis . IV . To assess predictor response perform tumor genotype study ( e.g . v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B [ BRAF ] , rat sarcoma [ RAS ] , phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase , catalytic subunit alpha [ PIK3CA ] , mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 [ MAP2K1 ] , v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 [ AKT1 ] , mesenchymal-epithelial transition [ MET ] , rearrange transformation [ RET ] /papillary thyroid carcinoma [ PTC ] rearrangement ) archive tumor tissue . V. To assess predictor response assess baseline expression level vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , phosphorylated vascular endothelial growth factor receptor ( pVEGFR ) , phosphorylated mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 ( pERK ) , phosphorylated AKT1 ( pAKT ) and/or total meet proto-oncogene ( MET ) immunohistochemistry archive tumor tissue . OUTLINE : Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally ( PO ) daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
