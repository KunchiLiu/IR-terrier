	<detailed_description>Mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) often represent early stage Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) , individual meet criterion MCI subsequently diagnose AD much high rate cognitively normal elderly peer . The goal current study determine whether dietary supplementation novel formulation curcumin ( component curry spice turmeric ) , good absorb efficiently transport brain , alter biological clinical marker associate AD risk , determine whether potential beneficial effect curcumin supplementation synergistic aerobic exercise . The investigator recruit 80 elderly participant meet criterion MCI . Over second 6 month study , curcumin placebo group divide group receive train either aerobic non-aerobic yoga determine synergism curcumin supplementation aerobic exercise . The effectiveness intervention measure use plasma sample ( expression Alzheimer-related biomarkers ) , neuropsychological , functional , behavioral assessment ( i.e . clinical measure ) collect baseline , 6 month , 12 month initiation treatment , subset participant receive brain image baseline 6 month . Dosage titered two week prior study start ( 1 capsule BID , first five day , 2 capsule BID five day , 6 capsule BID five day , 8 capsule BID- study dosage ) . Over first 6 month study , participant randomize equal group receive dietary supplementation either curcumin placebo . Patients stratify accord whether subjective memory complaint without MCI versus MCI . Over second 6 month study , participant randomize equal group receive dietary supplementation either curcumin placebo .</detailed_description>
