	<brief_summary>Background : Delirium important problem critical care . Its prevalence often reach 75 % intensive care patient . Its occurrence associate numerous complication deleterious consequence death , long stay , high cost , long-term cognitive impairment . Delirium treatment entail correct underlying cause usually initiate pharmacological intervention antipsychotic . Typical antipsychotic , particularly haloperidol , commonly use treat delirium although placebo-controlled trial pharmacological treatment delirium conduct . Furthermore , appropriate dos delirium treatment yet establish . In critical care , two pilot study provide first randomize , placebo-controlled evidence pharmacologic treatment ICU delirium . One find neither haloperidol ziprasidone significantly reduce incidence duration delirium compare placebo whereas one find quetiapine add as-needed haloperidol result faster delirium resolution . Objective : The goal study determine effectiveness antipsychotic regular dosage regimen ( quetiapine group haloperidol group ) compare as-needed haloperidol ( placebo group ) pharmacological treatment delirium . We conduct three-arm randomized control trial achieve goal . Materials Methods : During one year , 45 delirious patient three intensive care unit recruit randomized one three group . Randomization perform block 9 pharmacy department , use random number table . Patients continuously screen delirium use Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist ( ICDSC ) part routine care . A positive screening score ( ≥4 ) warrant confirmation delirium diagnosis treat physician . Treatment begin accord randomization group , provide informed consent obtain . Delirium status monitor episode use Nursing Delirium Screening Scale ( Nu-DESC ) . When Nu-DESC monitoring become negative delirium ( total score 2 ) , resolution episode confirm treat physician . A clinical evaluation psychiatrist perform within 24-48 hour two evaluation make treat physician ( begin end delirium episode ) . The treat physician initiate twice-daily treatment first five level three group : 1 ) 1 mg intravenous ( IV ) haloperidol + oral ( PO ) placebo , 2 ) 50 mg PO quetiapine + IV placebo , 3 ) IV + PO placebo . Therapy titrate upwards daily basis increment 1 ) 1 mg IV haloperidol 2 ) 50 mg PO quetiapine , 3 ) IV + PO placebo every 12 hr , respectively , subject receive least two dos as-needed haloperidol previous 24 hr . As-needed ( PRN ) dose 2 mg IV haloperidol q 30 minute available patient three group administer nurse symptom associate delirium resolve . In case unsuccessful as-needed treatment , rescue ( STAT ) dose 5 mg IV haloperidol q 30 minute available patient three group administer nurse agreement reach treat physician situation indeed call . The treatment level patient require STAT dose immediately raise level . The treatment stop one follow occurs : ( 1 ) subject deem treating physician , base clinical judgment , long demonstrate sign delirium , therefore , long require schedule therapy antipsychotic agent ; ( 2 ) 21 day therapy elapse ; ( 3 ) ICU discharge occur ; ( 4 ) life-threatening adverse event potentially attributable study drug occur warranted discontinuation study drug . Adverse effect closely monitor : extrapyramidal reaction , neuroleptic malignant syndrome , drowsiness , hypotension , QTc prolongation . The treatment level patient present non life-threatening adverse event immediately lower level directly . The sample size calculate 2-tailed test alpha .05 power .80 . The primary statistical analysis involve Cox proportional time event analysis compare three group . Secondary analysis use T-test comparison continuous variable chi square proportional analysis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Outcome Measures : •Time first resolution delirium . Secondary Outcome Measures : - Days delirium study - Duration delirium - Severity delirium ( high Nu-DESC score , mean episode Nu-DESC score ) - ICU hospital mortality - ICU hospital length stay - Length mechanical ventilation - Time spend deeply sedate ( RASS &lt; 3 ) - Episodes subject-initiated device removal - Use haloperidol therapy ( include total dose haloperidol equivalent study , number dos , number day therapy , use rescue IV haloperidol ) - Average daily maximum total antipsychotic drug dose haloperidol equivalents - Duration study drug administration - Use benzodiazepine ( convert lorazepam equivalent ) - Use opioids ( convert morphine equivalent ) - QTc prolongation - Extrapyramidal symptom - Neuroleptic malignant syndrome</detailed_description>
