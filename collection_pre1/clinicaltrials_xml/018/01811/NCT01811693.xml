	<brief_summary>This open , pilot , dose-escalation study glyceryl trinitrate ( GTN , Nitroglycerin ) administer paramedic field within 2 hour symptom onset 45 severely hypertensive stroke patient . The primary objective study evaluate feasibility , safety , physiologic efficacy field-initiated glyceryl trinitrate achieve modest reduction blood pressure . Patients acute stroke identified field paramedic receive train basic advanced cardiac life support , stroke recognition , specific procedure relevant propose study . Physician-investigators obtain informed consent subject study entry cellular phone contact paramedic . Paramedics initiate antihypertensive treatment apply transdermal GTN patch first two dose-tiers , administer single sublingual GTN meter spray follow application transdermal system last dose tier . The site involve study emergency medical service rescue ambulance 8 receive Stroke Center hospital Orange County , California , USA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The central aim phase 2a study identify regimen paramedic initiate glyceryl trinitrate antihypertensive therapy acute stroke patient safe , technically effective modestly lower blood pressure , optimal advance pivotal trial . The study design open-label dose escalation study three dose tier , . It anticipate trial identify promise prehospital GTN regimen advance pivotal , placebo-controlled , phase 3 trial . Primary Hypothesis : Prehospital glyceryl trinitrate treatment reduces severely hypertensive blood pressure elevation ED arrival . The primary study endpoint test hypothesis mean change SBP pre-treatment ED arrival . Secondary Hypotheses : 1 . Prehospital glyceryl trinitrate treatment reduces severely hypertensive blood pressure elevation early post-arrival timepoints increase proportion patient target blood pressure ED arrival early post-arrival timepoints . The secondary study endpoint analyze test hypothesis : 1 ) mean change SBP pre-treatment 30 minute ED arrival 60 minute ED arrival ; 2 ) proportion patient SBP &lt; 180 mm Hg ED arrival , 30 , 60 minute arrival . 2 . Prehospital initiation glyceryl trinitrate first 2 hour severely hypertensive patient stroke feasible safe . Safety GTN first 2 hour severely hypertensive stroke patient assess analysis serious adverse event , neurologic change , mortality . We hypothesize initiation treatment patient field associate favorable side effect profile without severe blood pressure lower le 120 mm Hg systolic . Successful completion study demonstrate feasibility recruit hypertensive stroke participant initiate GTN therapy field paramedic .</detailed_description>
