	<brief_summary>The aim study show decrease postoperative pain first postoperative mobilization surgery lumbar disc herniation co-analgesia single dose dexamethasone , pregabalin , combination two product . Pain assess simple numerical scale also evaluate 48 first post-operative hour . Determining optimal co-analgesic protocol result study could help develop validation study large scale medico-economic component . In addition , study protocol easy apply ( ponctual administration ) inexpensive .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Visit 1 ( J-30 J-1 ) : pre-inclusion visit During follow-up visit usual pathology , doctor propose patient participate protocol . Information Form give patient read home maintain sufficient time reflection . Physician investigator check eligibility criterion complete pre-screening form note follow information patient : No pre-enrollment , name , date , reason non-inclusion appropriate . Visit 2 ( J-1 ) : pre-anesthetic visit , day surgery During pre-anesthetic routine consultation , doctor check proper collection inform consent inform follow information CRF : randomization number , age , height , weight , ideal weight theory , gender patient . Visit 3 ( J0 ) : surgery One hour surgery , patient receive , accord randomization , premedication pregabalin LYRICA Â® placebo orally . Then patient conduct operating room induction general anesthesia surgery . Immediately induction anesthesia , depend randomization , patient receive intravenous dexamethasone placebo . At end surgery , patient conduct Post Anaesthesia Carry Unit ( PACU ) extubated receive routine care surgery . Extubation patient , denote H0 represent time measurement begin . The data collect H0 : - ENS score stand H0 , H0+30mn , H0+1h , H0+1h30 , H0+2 h , H0+6 h , H0+12 h , H0+24h , H0+48 h. - ENS score mobilization first time patient get ( edge bed stand possible ) - Qualification quality stand 0-4 ( Likert scale ( 0 = poor , 1 = poor , 2 = fair , 3 = good , 4 = good ) ) nurse staff first mobilization - Qualification patient satisfaction compare first stand score 0-4 ( Likert scale ( 0 = poor , 1 = poor , 2 = fair , 3 = good , 4 = good ) ) - Sedation score end SSPI , , H0+24h H0+48h - Nausea vomit score H0+24 h , H0+48 h - Tolerance treatment undertaken : visual disturbance , lightheadedness , urinary retention , pruritus , measure end SSPI H0+24 h H0+48 h - Consumption morphine H0+24 h H0+48 h - Assessment pain score 6 month score ENS rest , assessment neuropathic component DN4 scale .
