	<brief_summary>The human immune system usually tolerant million beneficial commensal bacteria ( microbiome ) , colonize healthy intestinal tract . In contrast , patient Inflammatory Bowel Disease ( IBD ) may play host imbalanced mix intestinal bacteria , initiate abnormal immune response susceptible individual . The result inflammation occur gastrointestinal tract damage intestinal lining , lead symptom ( intractable diarrhea , pain weight loss ) , heighten cancer risk , serious complication substantial morbidity even death . Current therapy IBD focus suppress excessive immune response bacteria , major side effect address role microbiome disease development . The investigator hypothesize heighten intraluminal generation pro-inflammatory factor luminal `` pathogenic '' bacteria , extracellular nucleotide purinergic derivative , trigger host immune cell . This result loss suppressive T regulatory cell unrestrained immune cell deviation pathogenic T helper cell cause inflammatory response . The investigator ' proposal correct disease-provoking microbiome would beneficially improve gut microbial diversity , alter immune response elicit patient microbial product pathogenic bacteria , ultimately limit suppress disease activity . To test hypothesis , investigator propose enroll patient active Crohn 's Disease , introduce microbiome healthy unrelated individual patient 's intestinal tract , via fecal biotherapy ( FBT ) applicable safety measure . The investigator propose comprehensively test effect FBT host microbiome , determine microbial production inflammatory nucleotides derivative , investigator suggest might impact host immune response disease activity patient IBD .</brief_summary>
