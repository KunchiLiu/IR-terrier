	<brief_summary>This study conduct patient newly diagnose breast cancer undergo chemotherapy prior surgery - neoadjuvant chemotherapy . The study involve treatment standard chemotherapy commonly use , FDA-approved , blood pressure drug call propranolol ( Inderal ) . The purpose study : 1 . Determine effect propranolol plus chemotherapy breast cancer cell well growth blood vessel surround breast cancer cell . 2 . Determine side effect profile propranolol chemotherapy patient breast cancer receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy . This research do previous laboratory work show propranolol may decrease ability blood vessel around breast cancer cell grow , may important help cancer cell grow . It also may reduce likelihood breast cancer cell spread . If change see breast cancer cell surround blood vessel study , pan evaluate whether propranolol decrease likelihood breast cancer recur future , later study . All chemotherapy regimen use study standard care many year ; however , use propranolol research along chemotherapy regimen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While number therapeutic option exist patient breast cancer ( BC ) , breast tumor biology differs across tumor BCs respond treatment . Identifying marker predict response could spare non-responders unnecessary side effect , cost , time . A recent example BC bevacizumab , expensive anti-angiogenic monoclonal antibody , FDA revoke approval patient metastatic BC . While targeted therapy may benefit patient , appropriate predictive marker identify drug development process . An ideal biologic marker would easy perform , reliable , low-cost non-invasive . A limitation assess tumor-based marker metastatic BC inability procure tumor tissue different treatment time . To circumvent issue , anti-cancer agent assess pre-operatively , woman newly diagnose BC receive study drug , alone chemotherapy , diagnostic breast biopsy surgical resection . In addition , tumor change directly compare modulation non-invasive marker , functional radiograph blood , identify non-invasive marker predict tumor response . The investigator conduct neoadjuvant single-institution trial non-selective , inexpensive β -blocker propranolol chemotherapy locally advance BC . β-blockade regulates angiogenesis primary breast tumor . In trial , investigator plan evaluate treatment-related microvascular response via change breast Diffuse Optical Tomography ( DOT ) , non-invasive , fast , safe , inexpensive breast image tool . As optical property contrast endogenous chromophore ( oxyhemoglobin , deoxyhemoglobin , water , lipid ) provide information tissue vascularity , monitor response anti-angiogenic agent . DOT change occur early 1 week start pre-operative therapy . The dynamic DOT system incorporate trial unique Columbia University Medical Center ( CUMC ) , design Columbia biomedical engineer . CUMC 's laboratory collaborator measure DOT system anti-angiogenesis agent animal model , demonstrate translational nature project . While non-dynamic DOT assess neoadjuvant trial small cohort receive heterogeneous chemotherapy agent , none evaluate DOT response anti-angiogenic agent .</detailed_description>
