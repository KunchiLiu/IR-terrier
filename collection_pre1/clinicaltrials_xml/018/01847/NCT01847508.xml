	<brief_title>PHILOS Augmented - Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Biomechanical test show augmentation screw nail polymethylmethacrylate ( PMMA ) lead increased mechanical property bone-implant complex , lead assumption augmentation could reduce mechanical failure patient . While clinical study already perform augment trochanteric nail proximal femur fracture , clinical study exist use Proximal Humerus Internal Locking System ( PHILOS ) ( PMMA ) augmentation treatment fracture proximal humerus . In study new standardize technique augmentation screw tip use high viscous PMMA cement ( Traumacem V+ ) PHILOS plate apply . Fracture treatment PHILOS Screw Augmentation compare treatment PHILOS without augmentation .</detailed_description>
