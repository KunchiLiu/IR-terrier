	<brief_summary>The overall goal study identify interference intramuscular Inactivated Polio Vaccine ( IPV ) vaccine ( Measles Rubella Yellow Fever ) co-administered nine month age confirm safety co-administration . In addition , study compare immunogenicity safety IPV administer via different route . A total 1504 healthy infant age nine ten month , complete primary immunization , include least three dos trivalent Oral Polio Vaccine ( tOPV ) recruit study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study conduct date , Inactivated Polio Vaccine ( IPV ) appear boost systemic immunity generate Oral Polio Vaccine ( OPV ) prim significantly effectively use additional dos OPV . The use IPV enhance immunity generate OPV also provide protection circulate Vaccine Derived Polio Virus type 2 outbreak Vaccine Associated Paralytic Poliomyelitis potential address concern regard switch bivalent OPV . Concomitant administration Expanded Program Immunisations ( EPI ) vaccine give nine month would feasible programmatic approach . Maternal antibody largely wan point negate inhibitory effect may within prim schedule . Significant interference IPV , Measles Rubella ( MR ) Yellow Fever ( YF ) vaccine must exclude ensure IPV introduction negatively impact immunogenicity safety vaccine program point . Restricted manufacturing capacity context high manufacturing cost OPV would currently limit rate IPV could roll within modified EPI schedule . The administration fractional dose vaccine Intradermal route would facilitate vaccine role limit cost manufacture scale-up require . The propose study phase 4 , eight-arm , open label , randomize control clinical vaccine trial . A total 1504 randomize healthy infant nine ten month receive IPV , MR YF vaccines either alone , combination two vaccine , three vaccine give together . Different route ( IM fractional dose ID ) needle free jet injection device administration IPV compare different group . The participant assign one eight group use blocked randomization scheme 1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio . Non- inferiority serological response median antibody titer primary immunogenicity end point . The incidence serious adverse event important medical event point study primary safety end point group . Following device reference needle/syringe administration , local adverse event ( reactogenicity ) , collect day 0 ( day vaccination ) , day 1 , day 2 day 3 second primary safety endpoint .</detailed_description>
