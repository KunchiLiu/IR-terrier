	<brief_title>Bioavailability Study Cinnamon Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : The objective trial evaluate bioavailability select procyanidin derive metabolites various form cinnamon . Study Products : Core Study - Control : Oatmeal ( ~70 g ) without cinnamon - Active A : Oatmeal ( ~70 g ) 3 g ground cinnamon - Active B : Oatmeal ( ~70 g ) 3 g cinnamon extract - Active C : Oatmeal ( ~70 g ) 6 g cinnamon extract Extension Study â€¢9 g cinnamon extract capsule form ( unblinded ) The 9 g/d cinnamon extract consume subject day 22 26 . At visit 6 ( day 27 ) , subject return clinic test day . The cinnamon extract capsule ( 9 g ) consume oatmeal ( 70 g ) breakfast . Subjects : Subjects healthy men 18 - 40 year age ( inclusive ) , body mass index ( BMI ) 25.00-29.99 kg/m2 . Outcome Variables : Primary Outcome Variable The primary outcome variable area curve ( AUC ) 0 360 min plasma procyanidin-derived metabolite , t=0 min start study product consumption . Secondary Outcome Variables Secondary outcome variable include assessment : - The maximum concentration ( Cmax ) time reach peak concentration ( Tmax ) plasma procyanidin-derived metabolite , well net incremental AUC value account possible non-zero pre-load value . - The effect single dose cinnamon metabolic profile use untargeted metabolomics analysis plasma urine specimen . - The effect single dose cinnamon plasma glucose insulin .</detailed_description>
