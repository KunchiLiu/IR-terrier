	<brief_title>Self-directed Video Versus Instructor-based Neonatal Resuscitation Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The NRP become self learn program follow write test practical hands-on evaluation ; way practical skill teach practiced uniformly determine . The current strategy teach involve resuscitation instructor . There several difficulty develop world achieve objective provider train neonatal resuscitation every delivery . Part problem due lack instructor and-or budget constraint addition logistic difficulty . Our Hypothesis well develop self administer video complement self practice use mannequin allow provider reach least similar performance initial step mask ventilation neonatal resuscitation . Objectives : The aim study test hypothesis self administrate video jointly mannequin give similar result current Neonatal Resuscitation Program ( NRP ) , pre-validated Objective Structured Clinical Examination ( OSCE ) hands-on course provide certified instructor . Specific aim : To compare effectiveness two different teach strategy quality ventilation mannequin , use mask NAÏVE provider . In two different moment , approximately 15 minute take course mean 3 month afterwards . Two different group novice provider randomly select receive one follow teach strategy : A . A Video base Self instruction simultaneous video trigger practice mannequin without instructor feedback ( Spanish South America , English North America ) initial step adequate mask ventilation neonatal resuscitation . B . A pre standardized hand lesson offer NRP certify instructor follow debrief session per pre-validated OSCE protocol ( current standard ) . Afterwards , subject invite ventilate mannequin standardize instruction ( tbd example…2 minute ventilation , rate 40 60 necessary pressure slightly reach chest rise ) . This performance digitally record . Two independent certify instructor evaluate performance , blind assign group . A previously validate OSCE ( objective structure clinical evaluation ) performance evaluation grid use . The gold standard consist high quality performance do NRP instructor .</detailed_description>
