	<detailed_description>The propose program unique delivery system development process . The program deliver computer game like format school-based intranet system ( i.e. , network computer link school-based server ) , enable user interact individually program share experience receive immediate feedback response classmate ' collective response . The delivery computer-based program assure fidelity implementation . Each activity ( component ) ultimately include program continually develop tested assure effective changing target theoretically base etiological mechanism ( risk factor ) . Development include experimental assessment evaluate effectiveness component effective component include program . The 7th grade version Click City® : Alcohol program consist 12 effective component deliver six session three-week period . This follow two 8th grade booster session , consist total 5 component deliver one-week period . Educational newsletter parent teacher guide develop accompany program .
