	<brief_summary>Response treatment Type 2 Diabetes highly variable ; medicine may little effect one person large effect another . Understanding mechanism alter response treatment could aid treatment selection assist design new medication low nonresponse rate . This study examine physiological mechanism potential clinical/biomarker predictor alter response sulphonylurea DPPIV inhibitor glucose lower medication answer fundamental methodological question future study variation treatment response Type 2 Diabetes . Participants withdraw sulphonylurea therapy 2 week assessment baseline characteristic glycaemic response . Participants enter optional extension receive sulphonylurea DPPIV inhibitor therapy crossover fashion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants withdraw sulphonylurea therapy 2 week ( part 1 ) follow optional cross-over extension ( part 2 ) randomize 4 week treatment Gliclazide ( DPP-IV thera ) Sitagliptin ( sulphonylurea ) , follow 4 week second treatment 2 week wash-out period . Part 1 allow assessment response rate long stand sulphonylurea treatment clinical practice potential predictor , well whether brief period ( 1 week ) treatment withdrawal valid assessment individual 's response therapy . Part 2 allow comparison approach part one response treatment trial set allow assessment whether response consistent across therapy different mechanisms action .</detailed_description>
