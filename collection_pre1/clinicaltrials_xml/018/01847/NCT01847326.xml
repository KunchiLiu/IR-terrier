	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation give together carboplatin follow chemoradiation treat patient recurrent head neck cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation , carboplatin , fluorouracil , hydroxyurea , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation follow chemoradiation therapy may effective treatment head neck cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) nab-paclitaxel ( paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation ) give combination FHX ( 5 fluorouracil [ fluorouracil ] , hydroxyurea twice daily radiation , good induction responder ) nab-paclitaxel add hypofractionated radiotherapy poor responder . II . To explore feasibility rapid palliative chemoradiotherapy approach inpatient refractory disease demonstrate failure respond initial chemotherapy . III . To explore role induction chemotherapy predictive tool definitive head neck cancer management previously treat patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Progression-free survival ( PFS ) ( time disease progression death cause ) study arm . II . Overall survival response rate arm . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine correlation secrete protein , acidic , cysteine-rich ( SPARC ) expression head neck cancer response therapy . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation . RE-INDUCTION THERAPY ( WEEKS 1-6 ) : Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 8 carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve good response undergo surgical resection proceed chemoradiation within 4-6 week . AFHX REGIMEN : Patients achieve response re-induction therapy receive hydroxyurea orally ( PO ) every 12 hour 6 day ( 11 dos ) begin day 0 , fluorouracil IV continuously 120 hour begin day 0 , paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV 30 minute day 1 . Patients also undergo radiation therapy twice daily ( BID ) day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 14 day 5 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PACLITAXEL + RADIATION ( AXX ) REGIMEN : Patients achieve response re-induction therapy receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV undergo hypofractionated radiation therapy day 1 . Courses repeat every 7 day 5 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow monthly 3 month , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 2 year , yearly thereafter .</detailed_description>
