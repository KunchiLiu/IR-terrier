	<detailed_description>Patients Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) abnormal finding include hemorrhagic cortical contusion petechial focus alter signal represent white matter injury . MRI , CT SPECT scan show change consistent Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) medical history Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) evidence medical record screen treatment Hyperbaric . Each patient undergo 5 times-a-week Hyperbaric treatment 1.5 atmosphere absolute ( ATA ) . Each patient SPECT scan , cognitive assessment , physician evaluation prior first treatment 40 , 80 , 120 treatment document progress treatment ( Harch et al , 2012 ) . Cognitive assessment include Trail Making Test Parts A B . Patient see physician ass level disability interval ; United States Department Veteran Affairs ' Evaluation Cognitive Impairment Subjective Symptoms ( VAECI ) ( 2012 ) tool utilized physician 's evaluation objective measure patient 's level disability . Hyperbaric treatment may adjust patient comfort . If SPECT scan , cognitive assessment physician evaluation show improvement 40 treatment , another 40 Hyperbaric ( HBO ) treatment administer . Treatments discontinue 40 session interval SPECT scan , cognitive assessment physician evaluation show improvement . The patient also SPECT scan cognitive assessment follow 3 month final Hyperbaric ( HBO ) treatment.The time point evaluation cognitive status single-photon emission computerize tomography ( SPECT ) scan 40,80,120 Hyperbaric ( HBO ) treatment . Treatment occur 5 time per week approximately 24 week another follow 3 month post treatment . This provide data point outcome measure .</detailed_description>
