	<brief_summary>One essential treatment assist patient recovery illness provision nutrition liquid form deliver stomach fluid vein . Until recently benefit nutrition undervalue critically ill , however , become clear targeted nutrition positively affect person 's outcome . This particularly important patient significantly unwell require increase amount nutrition support recovery . Inadequate nutrition therapy lead rapidly lose weight , predominantly form muscle loss greatly contribute poor recovery . Whilst nutrition essential recovery , several issue delivery nutrition via stomach ( commonly use method deliver nutrition critically ill ) . For many reason , patient unable tolerate large quantity nutrition via stomach addition hospital procedural reason nutrition turn lengthy period time . As , result patient delivered half nutrition plan . One potential way overcome deliver nutrition via vein , whilst nutrition stomach continue , aim meet energy gap lose inadequate nutrition via stomach . In study 100 patient , deliver combine nutrition via vein stomach 50 patient 50 patient receive nutrition per normal practice . We measure important outcome patient determine allow u meet significantly nutrition need . This study also help u determine best design large study strategy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Supplemental Parenteral Nutrition Critically Ill Adults : A Pilot Randomised Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The principal objective : 1 . To determine whether supplemental Parenteral Nutrition ( PN ) strategy lead delivery increase amount total nutrition ( measure energy deliver ) , safe regard adverse effect . 2 . To measure clinical outcome patient receive study strategy provide information assist design large randomize control trial . Secondary objective sub-set patient : 3 . To determine whether supplemental PN strategy lead improved nitrogen balance . 4 . To determine nutritional requirement nutritional intake critically ill patient period hospitalization transfer Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) .</detailed_description>

Partial pressure oxygen ( PaO2 ) / Fraction Inspired oxygen ( FiO2 ) ratio ≤ 300 mmHg 2 . Currently 1 continuous vasopressor infusion start least 4 hour ago minimum dose : 1 . Dopamine great 5 mcg/kg/min 2 . Noradrenaline ≥ 0.1mcg/kg/min 3 . Adrenaline ≥ 0.1 mcg/kg/min 4 . Any dose total vasopressin 5 . Milrinone &gt; 0.25mcg/kg/min ) 3 .

Currently intracranial pressure monitor ventricular drain situ 5 . Currently receive extracorporeal membrane oxygenation 6 . Currently ventricular assist device Both EN PN deliver enrollment ( i.e . either enteral tube central venous catheter place clinician feel EN PN safely administer due reason ) . Currently receive PN Standard PN solution deliver enrolment ( i.e . clinician believe patient definitely need specific parenteral nutrition formulation ( e.g . glutaminesupplementation specific lipid formulation ) . Death imminent deem highly likely next 96 hour . There current treatment limitation place patient unlikely survive 6 month due underlie illness More 80 % energy requirement satisfactorily deliver via enteral route last 24 hour .
