	<brief_summary>Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) disease cause raise blood pressure blood vessel pick oxygen lung . It life expectancy similar cancer . There treatment available cure . We know PAH associate weakness muscle legs , contribute symptoms patient ' experience . Researchers believe certain protein find high level blood patient chronic disease affect muscle function growth . One proteins call growth differentiate factor ( GDF ) 8 , high level associate muscle weakness chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) heart failure ( HF ) . Interestingly drug available block action GDF-8 muscle cell show animal result increased muscle size . A related protein call GDF-15 find elevated level patient PAH , link prognosis . Our preliminary data suggest GDF-15 also directly influence muscle size number situation . We aim investigate role GDF-15 related molecule development muscle weakness patient PAH . We measure certain marker muscle weakness take blood muscle sample patient control . We compare level GDF-15 tissue without muscle wasting . We hope work lead great understanding role GDF-15 development muscle weakness patient PAH . GDF-15 level may important allow u define patient muscle weakness . In future aim perform clinical trial drug block action GDF-15 .</brief_summary>
