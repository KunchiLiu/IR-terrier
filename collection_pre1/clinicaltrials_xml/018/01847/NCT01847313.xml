	<brief_summary>Diabetic kidney disease ( DKD ) devastate complication diabetes , 's bad form , lead early cardiovascular death kidney failure . A group medicine use treat diabetes , glucagon-like-peptide-1 analogue ( GLP-1 ) , may able protect people diabetes DKD reduce inflammation kidney . This study aim test theory study effect GLP-1 kidney function people diabetes . To understand GLP-1 affect inflammation , investigator give GLP-1 treatment ( Liraglutide ) people DKD monitor effect inflammation kidney function use blood urine test . The investigator compare result patient DKD receive GLP-1 treatment . If GLP-1 prof effective reduce inflammation improve kidney function , could develop viable new treatment people DKD , may significantly reduce disease burden , risk DKD , people diabetes . This would major advance treatment DKD .</brief_summary>
