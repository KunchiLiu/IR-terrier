	<brief_summary>Background . Increasing evidence indicate brain inflammation important pathogenesis neuropsychiatric disorder , include least significant proportion subject Autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) . Natural flavonoid , luteolin quercetin , exhibit potent antioxidant anti-inflammatory activity , inhibit release inflammatory mediator human mast cell , reduce maternal interleukin 6-induced autism-like behavioral deficit relate social interaction mouse . In case series 37 child ASD take dietary supplement contain luteolin quercetin 4 month report gain eye contact , attention social interaction accord parental report . Aim . The purpose study assess effectiveness tolerability white child ASD dietary supplement contain 2 flavonoid , luteolin quercetin , quercetin glycoside rutin . Methods . Fifty child ( 42 boys 8 girl ) divide 2 equal age group ( 4-6 year old , 7-10 year ) ASD enrol 26-week , prospective , open-label trial 2nd University Department Psychiatry `` Attikon '' General Hospital , Athens , Greece , Ethics Committee approve study . The parent subject inform study 's aim , include risk versus benefit participate participate well inclusion exclusion criterion , write consent participation study . Participants already diagnose ASD base clinical assessment , diagnosis corroborate 'Attikon ' clinic meeting cutoff score DSM-IV-TR , symptom list ADOS algorithm . All child medication naive . Apart diagnostic evaluation , assessment also include thorough medical evaluation comprise physical examination health history ( include review allergic gastrointestinal symptom , well food allergy food intolerance ) . All concurrent intervention thoroughly note ( type hour ) , do visit . After meet screen criterion , subject evaluate baseline visit , mid-trial visit 18 week , final visit 26 week . Children administer dietary formulation contain 2 flavonoid , luteolin ( 100 mg/capsule ) quercetin ( 70 mg/capsule ) , quercetin glycoside rutin ( 30 mg/capsule ) . The dose use 1 softgel capsule per 10 kg ( 22 lb ) weight per day food 26 week . The primary outcome age-equivalent score 3 domain Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales ( VABS ) , communication , daily living skill , socialization . The VABS choose impact agent adaptive functioning real life even important obtain good quality life alleviation symptom . The raw score interview also express age-equivalent score standard score compare subject 's peer . There also supplementary special norm individual autism . Although standard score could useful subject characterization , use outcome measure proven less sensitive due floor effect reduce variability , especially short time period , thus score underestimate change . Conversely , score special norm tend overestimate change , small increase raw score produce big improvement special norm percentile rank . Thus , raw score age-equivalent score seem appropriate use outcome measure , latter easily interpret change time . Secondary outcome include Aberrant Behavior Checklist ( ABC ) , Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist ( ATEC ) , Clinical Global Impression-Improvement score ( CGI-I ) . To explore possible effect formulation capture aforementioned instrument , choose record benefit observe report parent use . For , primary clinician ( K.F . ) conduct telephone in-person interview parent , independently assess clinician ( A.T. ) , discuss possible gain child . CGI-I also independently cod primary clinician personal assessment well information gather parent , majority case , subject ' trainer . Compliance monitor softgel capsule count parent ' assurance capsule actually take visit ; case capsule count &lt; 85 % prescribed dosage midterm end study , subject exclude final analysis . Adverse event systematically record adverse event form use scale indicate severity , relationship study procedure , action take , therapy require .</brief_summary>
