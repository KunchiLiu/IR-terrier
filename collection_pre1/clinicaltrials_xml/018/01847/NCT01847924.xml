	<brief_title>NEURoaid II ( MLC 901 ) Assessment Cognitively Impaired Not Demented Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A substantial proportion patient non-disabling stroke cognitively impaired compare aged education match community dwelling control . Moreover , post-stroke patient vascular cognitive impairment dementia ( VCIND ) moderate severity high risk incident dementia , dependency death . Further study urgently need demonstrate effective cognition enhance therapy VCIND give absence evidence base treatment option . Neuroaid Traditional Chinese Medicine show induce neurogenesis , promote cell proliferation stimulate development axonal dendritic network animal model . Neuroaid may improve functional recovery stroke patient . Neuroaid-II simplify formulation 9 herbal animal ingredient . The NEURoaid II ( MLC 901 ) assessment cognitively Impaired demented subject : pilot double blind , placebo-controlled randomize Trial Efficacy Safety ( NEURITES ) Study 24-week Phase II study . The primary outcome executive function measure Verbal Fluency test . Secondary outcome include cognitive measure ADAS-Cog , MoCA , MMSE Cognitive Battery ; Activities Daily Living measure ADCS-ADL scale ; behaviour measure Neuropsychiatric Inventory depression measure Geriatric Depression Scale Beck Depression Scale . Safety tolerability assess use adverse event , laboratory test , vital sign . The trial important translational medicine Singapore set new standard systematic evaluation Traditional Medicine integration standard medicine practice</detailed_description>
