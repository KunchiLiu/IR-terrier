	<brief_summary>The conventional glucocorticoid replacement therapy primary adrenal insufficiency- Addison 's disease , render cortisol level unphysiological , may cause symptom long-term complication . Many patient take stress-doses extra dos hydrocortisone cortisone acetate stressful physical psychological event . However , effect dose test scientific study . In double blind cross-over design pilot trial aim test effect extra dose cortisol physical activity hormone level .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Cortisol Physical Exertion Patients With Primary Adrenal Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Addison 's disease occur 90 % adrenal cortex destroy . Cortisol level serum vary throughout day . In addition daily need , cortisol increase response form stress include intercurrent illness . The Addison patient must situations increase replacement dose 2 3-fold . While broad agreement procedure base clinical experience empirical data , controversial whether need increase dose less stressful event task , average vigorous physical activity mental stress . In event , many patient report benefit stress dos order increase performance , also reduce post-exertion fatigue . Using combination oxygen uptake measurement control exercise assay hormone metabolite , aim test whether extra dos hydrocortisone increase physical capacity reduce post-exertion fatigue . Each patient perform two test , one one without hydrocortisone randomise order . The control perform one test . The patient assign participation number randomise two treatment sequence ( A-B B-A ) pharmacy . All exercise test perform 3-5 hour intake morning medication , overnight fast ( water permit ) . Patients instructed avoid caffeinated food drink , alcohol , strenuous exercise starvation least 24h exercise session . Patients instructed avoid smoking , brush teeth one hour exercise testing . One hour test , subject drink one teaspoon water per kilogram body weight provide adequate hydration . Stress-dose placebo take 60 min start . Also time , indwell line place forearm subject blood saliva drawn , directly exercise , 15 30 min termination exercise . Patients fill questionnaire quality life exercise . Patient 's daily glycemic profile follow continuous glucose monitor system 24 hour , 24 hour exercise . Patients educate use sensor calibration blood glucose self-measurements three four time per day . Calibration sensor perform accord protocol establish . At completion measure period , system return , data download determine glucose pattern . This device apply abdomen subject , 24 h exercise session , calibrate recommend ( operation 2-3 additional times/day , 6 h apart 24 h study ) remove 24 h exercise session . The patient 's movement follow 24 hour Actigraph test . The test repeat 1 week opposite treatment option . Ten adult patient ( 18-70 year ) verify Addison ` disease invited participate study . From list patient ( consecutive out-patients patient registry ) unselected patient invited participate . Five age sex match healthy control include assess normal metabolic endocrine response physical activity . The investigator keep log patient invited participate study . If screen patient fulfil inclusion criterion , reason document screen log . Eligible patient fulfil inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion randomise . Randomization perform hospital pharmacy study site . When subject randomize , must always assign low available randomization number . The patient randomise block two secure even patient number treatment sequence . The patient give write informed consent . The patient take grapefruit juice , liquorice special diet last two week study period . Patients instructed avoid caffeinated food drink , alcohol , strenuous exercise starvation least 24 h exercise session . Patients instructed avoid smoking least one hour exercise session . Withdrawal criteria/Adverse Events . The patient free withdraw time . If patient major difficulty manage exercise investigator consider withdrawal . In best interest patient , investigator sponsor decide withdraw patient study . If patient develops condition meet exclusion criterion , patient withdrawn study . In case serious adverse event patient may withdraw study . Any adverse event register report Norwegian Medicines Agency . Any serious adverse event report within 15 day , case lethal life threaten event immediately . The patient report problem discomfort examination patient log diary , need extra dos study day exercise glucocorticoid also document . In addition , ask contact study group directly case problem visit . The study documentation research date store 15 year termination study . Statistical consideration This pilot study evaluate effect stress-dosing cortisol physical capacity . The result use statistical calculation effect size large trial . The variation various efficacy parameter group patient well know .</detailed_description>
