	<detailed_description>Although change lung , know remodeling , feature asthma , cause mechanism involve process yet find . Recently , establish remodel observed child prior formal diagnosis asthma . Clinical study indicate HRV , `` common cold '' infection , common cause recurrent respiratory illness childhood , child HRV-associated wheeze episode increase risk develop asthma . This lead hypothesis HRV infection may play central role start airway remodel lead asthma . The goal study determine alteration relevant airway remodel growth factor differ healthy control asthmatic subject , pre- post-HRV infection . These growth factor assess bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) fluid endobronchial biopsy tissue correlate viral level nasal lavage BAL fluid .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Asthmatics : Male female volunteer intermittent persistent mild moderate allergic asthma , define GINA guideline 39 . Between ≥18 ≤ 50 year age . Objective evidence variable airflow limitation ( ≥12 % least 200mL postbronchodilator reversibility baseline ) , airway hyperresponsiveness ( PC20 methacholine &lt; 16mg/ml ) screen visit within past 24 month . Prebronchodilator spirometry baseline ; FEV1 ≥70 % predict ; FEV1/VC ≥50 % . Atopic , evidence positive skin prick test ≥1 common aeroallergen , positive define wheal ≥2 mm compare negative control . Not exposed sensitize seasonal allergen least 4 week study . Chronic exposure perennial allergen permit . Asthma symptoms control either inhaled β22agonists alone , low moderate dose ICS ( ≤800mcg budesonide equivalent per day ) , administer either monotherapy fixeddose combination longacting β22agonist ( LABA ) . The dos maintenance medication remain stable 4 week prior study screen phase ( Visit 2 ) . Stable asthma symptom , history asthma exacerbation require short burst prednisone treatment within 3 month prior study entry . Be nonsmoker , define smoke past 12 month , lifetime ≤ 10 packyear smoke history . In good general health ( asthma ) without clinically significant medical history comorbidities , BMI ≤ 30 kg/m2 . Have history life threaten episode asthma , judge study physician ; may include , limited , prior ICU admission intubation . Subjects , partner , must use reliable form contraception continuously 4 week prior , 4 week post participation . NonAsthmatics : Male female volunteer , ≥18 ≤ 50 year age , good general health , without clinically significant medical history BMI ≤ 30 kg/m2 . Nonasthmatic , define history normal spirometry ( FEV1 ≥80 % FEV1/FVC ≥75 % predict value ) . Normal airway responsiveness ( PC20 methacholine ≥16 mg/ml ) . Nonatopic , determine skin prick test common aeroallergens , positive test define wheal ≥ 2 mm compare negative control . Be nonsmoker ≥1 year , lifetime ≤ 10 packyear smoke history smoking . Subjects , partner , must use reliable form contraception continuously 4 week prior , 4 week post participation . All potentially eligible study subject must willing participate study , able provide write consent prior start study . The study protocol consent form approve Calgary Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board . Presence neutralize antibody HRV39 screen visit titer ≥ 1:2 . Have symptom active viral respiratory tract infection ( cold symptom ) , corroborate score 3 high Jackson cold symptom questionnaire , screen phase ( Visit 3 ) . Current pregnancy positive urine pregnancy test screening study . Use follow medication precede 4 week prior study entry study : : oral topical antihistamine , leukotriene receptor antagonist , inhaled anticholinergic , nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDS ) , antibiotic antiviral medication , counter 'cold ' influenza remedy , include decongestant , oral anticoagulant . Use prednisone within last 3 month . Current acute chronic illness ( include infection ) recent recovery ( within 4 week ) acute illness could , opinion study physician , alter inflammatory response ( e.g. , influenza , cold respiratory infection , etc. ) . • Autoimmune disease immunodeficiency , household contact know immune deficient . Known allergy lidocaine . Any significant concomitant medical issue , finding physical examination laboratory testing , opinion study physician , may pose additional risk participation study ( include undergo bronchoscopy ) , may impact quality interpretation data obtain study . Clinically significant prebronchoscopy safety assessment laboratory test ( CBC , INR , electrolytes creatinine ) , well positive urine pregnancy test female subject childbearing age , do visit 2 ( day 26 ) visit 5 ( Day 0 ) prior bronchoscopy Day 7 Day 4 .</criteria>
