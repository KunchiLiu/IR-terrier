	<brief_title>Lisinopril Reducing Shortness Breath Caused Radiation Therapy Patients With Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore adverse event profile lisinopril , external beam radiation therapy ( RT ) lung . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore level patient-reported acute respiratory distress ( dyspnea ) external beam RT . II . To explore level patient-reported symptom external beam RT . III . To explore impact lisinopril treatment patient quality life ( QOL ) external beam RT . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Beginning within 7 day begin radiation therapy , patient receive lisinopril orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-7 . ARM II : Beginning within 7 day begin radiation therapy , patient receive placebo PO QD day 1-7 . In arm , treatment repeat every 7 day 3 month completion radiation therapy absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
