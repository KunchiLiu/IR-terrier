	<brief_summary>The drug nimorazole belongs class chemical know 5-nitroimidazoles . Drugs class use infection . In addition , nimorazole make tumor cell sensitive radiotherapy . Therefore , investigator want find whether addition nimorazole standard treatment radiotherapy combination chemotherapy cisplatin show activity type head neck cancer safe . Furthermore investigator investigate specific examination do tumor tissue help predict whether treatment work . To find activity observe treatment cause chance alone , investigator need obtain data patient receive treatment patient receive treatment . The data two group patient compare see treatment well . Participants split 2 group . Each group receive different treatment . The treatment group receive determine chance use computer program . This work like flip coin call randomization . This help make sure group patient similar study start . Neither , study doctor , study staff influence group place treatment receive . If allocate group 1 , Patient receive radiotherapy combination chemotherapy cisplatin nimorazole pill . This consider 'experimental ' treatment . If allocate group 2 , patient receive radiotherapy combination chemotherapy cisplatin call 'placebo ' pill . The placebo dummy treatment . It look like real one , . It contain active ingredient/medicine .</brief_summary>
