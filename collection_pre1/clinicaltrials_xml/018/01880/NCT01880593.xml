	<brief_summary>The purpose study test antidepressant effect ketamine give repeatedly period 1 week , well use Lithium relapse-prevention strategy patient treatment-resistant depression ( TRD ) respond initial series ketamine infusion . Ketamine Food Drug Administration approve anesthetic ( drug use produce loss consciousness surgery ) . Ketamine approve treatment major depressive disorder consider experimental study . An additional purpose study research effect ketamine brain function . You may qualify take part research study diagnose major depressive disorder ( MDD ) respond past treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ketamine Plus Lithium Treatment-Resistant Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) disable medical illness current monoaminergic treatment slow act posse limit efficacy . In context , discovery glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine rapidly antidepressant ( onset action within hour ) -- even patient suffer treatment-resistant depression ( TRD ) -- ignite tremendous enthusiasm among clinician , scientist patient alike . A critical obstacle translation discovery novel treatment , however , limited duration action follow course ketamine ( e.g . 1-2 week ) . The current project address important gap medical knowledge test rational neuropharmacological strategy design optimize sustain rapid antidepressant effect ketamine . Driven recent characterization molecular mechanism underpin antidepressant neuroplasticity effect ketamine , test combination ketamine plus lithium patient TRD use randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled design . The primary aim project ( 1 ) test efficacy lithium-plus-ketamine compare placebo-plus-ketamine antidepressant combination strategy TRD ( 2 ) gather data safety tolerability lithium-plus-ketamine .</detailed_description>
