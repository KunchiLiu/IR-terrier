	<brief_summary>Glioblastoma common primary malignant neoplasm adult brain . Even multimodal therapy , outcomes remain poor , median survival one year . Although advanced image method suggest molecular marker prognosis therapeutic response , method validate clinical use . In exploratory , imaging-based , trial , thirty patient pathological diagnosis glioblastoma follow prospectively two year . The study examine PET MR imaging signal change follow administration standard radio-chemotherapy treatment regimen determine whether image modality provide early indicator response therapeutic intervention . The investigator hypothesize decrease uptake investigational 18F-FLT PET tracer follow treatment radiation chemotherapy reliable predictor glioblastoma response . In exploratory fashion , investigator also identify change diffusion hypoxia MR imaging may also correlate well treatment response .</brief_summary>
