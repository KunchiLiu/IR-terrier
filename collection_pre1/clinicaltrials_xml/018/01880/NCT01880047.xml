	<brief_summary>Study rationale base data previous clinical study eltrombopag ITP patient report non responder maximal approve dose 75 mg daily . The trend normal volunteer patient ITP suggest increase response rate increase dos eltrombopag dose 75mg . Previously publish data show overt increase toxicity normal volunteer , oncology patient aplastic anemia patient treat escalated dos high high propose study . It therefore seem possible ITP patient respond dose 75mg daily , eltrombopag could effective high dose . We propose double blind randomize controlled trial ITP patient define non-responders maximum dose ( 75mg ) eltrombopag , assess efficacy toxicity high daily dos ( 100mg , 125 mg , 150 mg )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Eltrombopag Escalated Doses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preliminary data pediatric patient ( seem metabolize eltrombopag differently especially young age ) find middle low age cohort , even dose 75 mg often insufficient obtain response . Altogether , data suggest high dose ITP may efficacious increase platelet count overt increase toxicity normal volunteer , oncology patient aplastic anemia patient treat dos high high propose study . Double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled trial subject ITP 'non-responders ' maximum package insert dose ( 75mg ) eltrombopag ; non-responders platelet count &lt; 50,000 despite take 75 mg/day eltrombopag least 3 week . Study Design ( First part ) : 8 Weeks Subjects randomly allocate two one ratio receive treatment placebo . All subject study receive 75 mg eltrombopag randomize receive either additional 25 mg eltrombopag match placebo tablet dispense research pharmacy . Subjects investigator blind randomization . Randomization stratify accord splenectomy status . Randomization perform time inform consent computer generate randomization table . Subjects investigator blind assignment treatment phase . Eltrombopag administer 8 week platelet count exceed 100,000 ; point dose stop , subject consider responder subject eligible enter Part 2 ( long term treatment part study ) desire agreed appropriate subject give consent , treat physician . The dose subject achieve primary endpoint ( &gt; 50,000 increase &gt; 20,000 ) consider dose response . Even patient achieves response , platelet count remain &lt; 100,000 , dose escalation schema figure continue . Dose escalation continue , despite satisfaction primary endpoint study ( &gt; 50,000 &gt; 20,000 baseline ) , unless platelet count reach 100,000 . The rationale approach maximize clinically relevant response subject standardize data analysis . Subjects stop study medication platelet count within normal range , thereby minimize safety risk associate elevated platelet count . By continue dose escalate subject platelet count &gt; 100,000 , maximum response correlation dose track allow well understand sustained response dose-dependent response , applied future consideration dosage period short-term hemostasis ( i.e surgical procedure ) . The 8 week data collect enrolled subject standardize protocol balance consistency dosage unequivocality response maintain subject safety . Enrollment stratify address concern regard inclusion pediatric subject . Enrollment begin adult subject ≥ 18 year age , safety information available review least three adult patient receive active therapy 8 week exposure maximal propose dose 150 mg. After review unblinded safety information independent Data Safety Monitoring Officer ( DMSO ) allow pediatric patient 12-18 year age enroll protocol . Long Term Treatment Extension ( Part 2 ) : ( 18 month ) After 8 week dose stop platelet count &gt; 100,000 , subject unblinded , data form complete assistance research pharmacy . Subjects receive respond eltrombopag high dose treatment option continue therapy periodic monitoring ongoing dose adjustment . Subject platelet count &gt; 100,000 enter Part 2 dose subject meet primary response criterion platelet count decrease &lt; 100,000/uL ( microliters ) serial monitoring immediate post-study monitoring period . Subjects randomize placebo group respond opportunity receive open label escalate dose eltrombopag 8 week follow study protocol randomize active drug study . This group provide `` confirmatory group '' see rate response randomize group confirm group . Consent obtain additional monitoring bone marrow aspirate biopsy 1 year additional ophthalmologic examination 6 month 18 month . The trial 80 % statistical power 5 % level significance ( two side ) detect difference proportion subject receive increase dose eltrombopag primary response ( 2 consecutive platelet count &gt; 50,000 increase &gt; 20,000 study baseline 8 week increase dose window result rescue treatment ) subject without primary response placebo group assume 50 % subject randomize active drug response 5 % subject randomize placebo would response . However interim analysis would perform 18 subject test futility efficacy also re-estimate sample size . If neither futility efficacy meet trial would continue enroll . Based observed treatment effect interim analysis sample size would allow expand 60 subject . Dose modification make basis individual platelet response detail maximal dose 150mg .</detailed_description>
