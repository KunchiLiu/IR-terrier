	<brief_summary>This study integrate wireless EEG system ordinary rehabilitation device ( upper limb ergometer , `` arm bike '' ) use Department Physical Medicine Rehabilitation hospital brain-computer-interface ( BCI ) -controlled neurorehabilitation device , aim test effectiveness device . We hypothesize , couple electroencephalographic signal relate initiation limb movement mechanical device assist intend movement effective facilitate motor recovery patient brain lesion . We propose enroll 20 patient cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) ( 4-24 month onset CVA ) patient randomly assign experimental ( use BCI control device undergo standard rehabilitation ) control group ( undergo standard rehabilitation alone ) . To compare rehabilitation result among group , propose use various assessment tool include clinical evaluation ( Fugl-Meyer assessment , Modified Ashworth scale , Motor Activity Log , Functional Independence Measure ) well functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) Diffusion Tensor Imaging ( DTI ) , immediate 2 month completion training protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Evaluating effectiveness Wireless EEG-based BCI-controlled Rehabilitation System patient stroke Applying brain-computer interface ( BCI ) improve life-quality handicap conveniences healthy people real life list one top 20 issue neuroscience field recent 20 year . Over past year , Biomedical Engineering R &amp; D Center China Medical University ( CMU ) Hospital devote develop wireless wearable brain-signal detection equipment relate software hardware . Recently , wireless electroencephalogram ( EEG ) system integrate test , side-by-side commercially available wire EEG system , oftentimes used standard laboratory EEG experiment . After examination cognitive task , quality device detect signal comparable commercial EEG system . As result , integrate wireless EEG system ordinary rehabilitation device ( upper limb ergometer , `` arm bike '' ) use Department Physical Medicine Rehabilitation hospital BCI-controlled neurorehabilitation device , propose use rehabilitation therapy patient stroke . We hypothesize , couple electroencephalographic signal relate initiation limb movement mechanical device assist intend movement effective facilitate motor recovery patient brain lesion . To test effectiveness propose wireless EEG-based BCI-controlled rehabilitation device , propose enroll 20 patient cerebrovascular accident ( CVA ) ( 4-24 month stroke attach ) patient randomly assign experimental control group . Patients experimental group undergo 80 minute standard rehabilitation therapy 20 minute BCI-controlled upper limb ergometer train one rehabilitation session ; control group take 100 minute standard rehabilitation therapy . All participant receive 3 rehabilitation session week 8 week ( total 24 session ) . To evaluate rehabilitation result different training protocol , propose use behavioral assessment brain imaging tool ( fMRI DTI ) . To compare rehabilitation result among group , propose use various assessment tool include clinical evaluation ( Fugl-Meyer assessment , Modified Ashworth scale , Motor Activity Log , Functional Independence Measure ) well functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Diffusion Tensor Imaging , immediate 2 month completion training protocol . If significant difference behavioral neuroimage evaluation two group achieve , integrate wireless-EEG rehabilitation system behavioral-neuroimage assessment procedure new rehabilitation protocol real clinical trial large sample size .</detailed_description>
