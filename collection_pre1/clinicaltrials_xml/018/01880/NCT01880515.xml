	<brief_summary>1 . Advanced NSCLC poor prognosis positive impact chemotherapy limit development intrinsic acquire resistance . 2 . Over past decade , less toxic agent innovative targeted therapy , i.e . erlotinib gefitinib , potential improve effectiveness keep good quality life low toxicity 3 . BIBW 2992 , aniline-quinazoline , EGFR HER-2 irreversible inhibitor , activity erlotinib-resistant isoforms mutation EGFR HER-2 4 . This molecule show benefit single agent pre-treated patient progress despite platinum-based chemotherapy , minimal toxicity compare chemotherapy 5 . BIBW 2992 associated adverse effect similar erlotinib gefitinib , rash diarrhea . These symptom reduce quality life patient lead inconsistent EGFR inhibitor dose administration 6 . There standard treatment rash , case report try demonstrate benefit obtain alcohol-free emollient , sunscreen titanium dioxide antibiotic ( topic oral ) treatment clindamycin doxycycline , anti-inflammatory drug steroid isotretinoin treatment cutaneous injury . 7 . In order reduce incidence severity cutaneous toxicity , compare prophylactic antibiotic treatment use tetracycline general dermatological recommendation versus use dermatological recommendation , patient initiate treatment BIBW 2992</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tetracycline Prophylaxis Rash Patients With NSCLC Receiving Treatment With BIBW 2992</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Case report try demonstrate benefit obtain alcohol-free emollient use 2-3 time daily , sunscreen titanium dioxide zinc oxide SPF great 15 , antibiotic ( topic oral ) treatment ( clindamycin , metronidazole , tetracycline ) secondary infection steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( betamethasone , triamcinolone ) isotretinoin treatment cutaneous injury . The objective project evaluate whether prophylactic treatment tetracycline reduce dermatological occurrence rash , induced EGFR HER-2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor BIBW 2992 patient non-small cell lung cancer , improve patient 's quality life .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Diagnosis nonoperable , locally advanced , recurrent metastatic , histologically cytologically document nonsmall cell lung cancer ( stage IIIB IV ) . Patients evidence measurable disease . 18 year old ECOG performance status 03 At least 12 week life expectancy Patients nonsmall cell lung cancer stag IIIB/IV receive least one cycle platinumbased , first second line systemic standard chemotherapy , documented failure treatment . More 2 previous chemotherapy regimen allow . The patient recover toxic effect least 2 week elapse last dose entry ( 14 day vinorelbine vinca alkaloid gemcitabine ) . Patients investigator 's opinion fully recover surgery least 4 week may also consider study . Patients recover severe toxicity ( CTC &gt; 1 ) cause previous therapy . Granulocyte count &gt; 1.5x 109/L platelet count &gt; 100x 109/L . Serum bilirubin &gt; 1.5 upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST and/or ALT &gt; 2 ULN ( &gt; 5 x ULN clearly attributable presence hepatic metastasis ) . Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 ULN creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min Capability fulfill study followup procedure . A negative pregnancy test obtain woman childbearing potential within 72 hour previous therapy beginning . Patients reproductive potential use effective contraceptive method . Written ( sign ) inform consent participate study Patients allergic antibiotic therapy use . Any unsteady systemic disease ( include active infection , hypertension grade unsteady angina , congestive cardiac failure , hepatic , renal metabolic disease ) . A previous treatment use systemic antitumor therapy EGFR inhibitor ( tyrosine kinase inhibitor ) . Any malignant pathology within 5 previous year ( except carcinoma situ cervix basalcell type skin cancer appropriately treat ) . Patients cerebral metastasis spinal marrow compression recently diagnose and/or definitely surgery and/or radiation naïvetreatment patient exclude . Those previously diagnose treat metastasis CNS spinal marrow compression , evidence steady disease ( clinically steady image study ) accept least 2 month . Any significant ophthalmologic abnormality , especially severe dryeye syndrome , keratoconjunctivitis sicca , Sjögren 's syndrome , severe exposure keratitis disorder may increase risk corneal epithelial injure . Contact lens use study recommend . The decision continue use contact lens discuss oncologist responsible patient treatment ophthalmologist . Patients take oral medication , require intravenous nutrition , underwent previous surgical procedure affect absorption , active peptic ulcer . Nursing woman .</criteria>
