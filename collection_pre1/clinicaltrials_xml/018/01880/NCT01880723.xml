	<brief_summary>Our aim determine exhale breath condensate ( EBC ) could detect difference ion regulation cystic fibrosis ( CF ) healthy measure effect albuterol EBC ion population . We hypothesize EBC chloride sodium would lower CF patient baseline albuterol would decrease EBC sodium increase EBC chloride .</brief_summary>
