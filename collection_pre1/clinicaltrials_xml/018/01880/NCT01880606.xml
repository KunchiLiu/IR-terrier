	<brief_summary>Evaluation efficacy laser-based endomicroscopy complement white-light colonoscopy chromoendoscopy early detection colon dysplasia patient PSC-IBD . White-light colonoscopy routinely used procedure colorectal cancer surveillance program . However , permit detection early dysplastic lesion . Chromoendoscopy apply dye ( indigo-carmine ) colonoscope help identify flat lesion suitable accurate endoscopic diagnosis dysplasia intraepithelial neoplasia Under aim perform clinical study evaluate newly develop technique allow vivo confocal microscopy assessment colon mucosa use laser-based endomicroscopy together intravenous administration fluorescein ( FITC ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chromoendoscopy apply dye ( indigo-carmine ) colonoscop new standard cancer surveillance patient IBD . It give opportunity identify suspect area dysplasia take targeted biopsy . The diagnostic accuracy improve chance detect dysplastic area increase . In recent year new endoscopic technique develop , include laser-based endomicroscopy . There increase need structure evaluation efficiency technique . Laser-based endomicroscopy , take vivo confocal microscopy picture colonoscopy examination , promise new method . This method establish highly rat center early diagnosis neoplasia bile ducts esophagus role detection early malignancy colon know study issue high clinical value . Specific question : Does use laser-based endomicroscopy increase chance early detection dysplasia ? What intraobserver variability ? What learn curve interpretation confocal microscopy picture ? Material method : A laser-based endomicroscope ( Cellvizio® , Mauna Kea Technologies ) acquire examination procedure establish Unit Gastroenterology Hepatology , Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge . Eighty patient PSC IBD include annual surveillance colonoscopy routine biopsy regime include study . After informed consent , patient investigate laser-based endomicroscopy surveillance colonoscopy . Each colonic segment examine stain indigo-carmin . After intra-venous fluorescein ( FITC ) injection , macroscopically abnormal lesion examine endomicroscopy . Intravenous administration FITC make possible obtain vivo microscopic picture 1000x magnification colon mucosa . The Cellvizio® technique allow evaluation epithelial endothelial cell structure area suspicious change well acquisition direct biopsy . Confocal picture sit biopsy take saved future blind re-evaluation . The biopsy take accord routine standard minimum 2 biopsy 10 cm colon . For immunological microbiological ( specific aim 2 ) part study , additional 16 biopsy gather leave , transverse , right colon . All laser-based endomicroscopy picture sequence saved evaluation application arrange pedagogical session evaluation learn curve technique .</detailed_description>
