	<brief_summary>Various stimulus trauma , infection major surgery may alter physiologic immune balance initiate systemic inflammatory process . This pathophysiological event characterize release potent inflammatory mediator circulation . Among , pro- anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , IL-8 IL-10 , ICAM-1 play dominant role local systemic regulator acute inflammatory response . Recent study also investigate role matrix metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) inflammatory response . The MMPs constitute family enzymes structurally related neutral proteinase . MMPs degrade essentially extracellular matrix ( ECM ) component play important role wound heal remodel ECM . The Tissutal Inhibitor MetalloProteine ( TIMPs ) important regulator MMPs activity . The inflammatory response come surgery mainly affect surgical patient ' outcome . Many factor may attribute response , kind operation , extent surgical trauma , patient 's medical history therapy , well type anesthesia use . Apart , kind fluid administer volume replacement reveal alter inflammatory process . Several study address issue mainly involve abdominal surgery provide compelling evidence perioperative fluid optimization produce benefit patient , regard inflammatory biomarkers cytokine , matrix metalloproteinases , intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( ICAM-1 ) . They support different volume replacement strategy , use crystalloids combination crystalloids colloid ( HES 130/0,4 ) , may important impact immune response . However , relevant study investigate different inflammatory biomarkers , usually involve either metalloproteinases , inhibitor ( TIMPs ) cytokine . In study investigated hypothesis intra- postoperative volume replacement HES attenuate inflammatory response elective abdominal surgery compare RL fluid therapy . For purpose metalloproteinases , MMP-9 , MMP-13 , inhibitor , TIMP-1 , cytokine , IL-6 , IL-8 intercellular adhesion molecule-1 , ICAM-1 investigate postoperatively . Their change first 24 postoperative hour consist primary outcome .</brief_summary>
