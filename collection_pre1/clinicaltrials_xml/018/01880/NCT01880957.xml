	<brief_summary>The primary aim study : 1 . Quantify serotonin transporter ( 5-HTT ) bind potential ( BP ) vivo bipolar disorder patient ( BPD ) major depressive episode ( MDE ) . 2 . Assess effect lithium treatment bipolar disorder 5-HTT . 3 . Assess effect lithium treatment bipolar disorder 5-HT1A BP . 4 . Assess effect lamotrigine treatment bipolar disorder 5-HTT 5-HT1A BP . 5 . Assess effect lithium treatment unipolar depression 5-HTT BP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PET MRI image use investigate aim describe patient bipolar disorder unipolar depression currently experience depressive episode . Both healthy control depress participant bipolar disorder unipolar depression recruit . Patients medication enrol study three week washout . At baseline , healthy control patient MRI consist structural functional sequence . Psychological measure also obtain baseline . Within one week MRI , patient healthy control one CUMI one DASB PET scan . Following baseline PET scan , patient participant begin medication treatment either lithium lamotrigine , base clinical judgement treat psychiatrist . Psychological measure obtain every 2 week . After 6 week medication treatment therapeutic dose , patient assess remission ( defined 50 % decrease HDRS score baseline ) . If criterion meet , patient participant follow-up PET scan ( one CUMI one DASB ) . If criterion meet , patient switch medication study reevaluate additional 4 week medication treatment . Patients still demonstrate 50 % decrease HDRS consider non-responders repeat CUMI DASB scan .</detailed_description>
