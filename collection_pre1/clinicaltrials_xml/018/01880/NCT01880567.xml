	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn combination ibrutinib rituximab help control MCL patient relapse refractory disease patient 65 newly diagnose MCL . The safety drug combination also study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Ibrutinib + Rituximab Relapsed/Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma ( R/R MCL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible study , begin first cycle treatment ibrutinib rituximab . Each cycle 28 day . Ibrutinib Administration : Every day take 4 ibrutinib capsule 1 cup ( 8 ounce ) water . Do open capsule dissolve . If miss dose , take 6 hour time would take . If later 6 hour , skip dose start take capsule time usual next day . You need fill diary card information take ibrutinib . You bring diary card appointment . You receive 30 day supply ibrutinib capsule Day 1 Cycles 1-9 . After , start Cycle 10 , receive 60-day supply drug every cycle . Rituximab Administration : On Days 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 Cycles 1 2 , receive rituximab vein . The first infusion take 6-8 hour . After , infusion take 4 hour . You receive rituximab vein 4 hour Day 1 Cycles 3-8 every cycle 2 year . For patient , may receive rituximab dose 2 day . Your doctor tell best approach . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , bone marrow biopsy and/or aspiration check status disease . - If study doctor think need , gastrointestinal endoscopy . - If study doctor think need , PET/CT scan check status disease . On Days 8 , 15 , 22 Cycle 1 , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . On Day 1 Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , every 3 cycle , study doctor think need , CT scan check status disease . You may scan less often . On Day 1 Cycle 1 : - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw biomarker test check status disease . Biomarkers find blood may relate reaction study drug . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw check immune system . One time Cycles 2-10 , study doctor think need , blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw biomarker test check immune system . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete follow-up . End-of-Treatment Visit : After finish taking study drug : - You physical exam . - You EKG check heart function . - Blood ( 5-7 tablespoon ) draw routine test , biomarker testing , immune system test , check status disease . - You CT scan and/or x-ray check status disease . - If doctor think need , PET/CT scan and/or bone marrow biopsy/aspiration check status disease . - If doctor think need , gastrointestinal endoscopy . - If become pregnant , blood ( 1Â½ tablespoon ) urine pregnancy test . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw biomarker test check status disease . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw check immune system . Long Term Follow-Up : After end-of-treatment visit , call every 3 month 1 year every 6 month see . These call take 2-3 minute . If stop study drug disease get well stable time stop take study drug , blood drawn every month 3 month , every 2 month 6 month , every 3 month check status disease . This investigational study . Ibrutinib FDA approve commercially available treatment MCL . Its use study investigational . Rituximab FDA approve treatment non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma certain type leukemia . Up 100 patient take part multicenter study . All 100 enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
