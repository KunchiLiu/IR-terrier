	<detailed_description>Obesity worldwide problem lead multiple metabolic endocrinological problem , include type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . In T2DM , body unable response circulate insulin level , ultimately destroys pancreatic β-cells , lead chronic hyperglycaemia ensue consequence Intestine able produce endocrinologically active substance , affect body 's intermediary metabolism . One substances glucose-dependent insulinotrophic polypeptide ( GIP , part incretin family ) , potentiate release insulin postprandially . However , recent evidence suggest , GIP may harmful beneficial role pathogenesis : show GIP participate development insulin resistance , key defect process metabolic dysfunction . GIP may also regulate postprandial redistribution splanchnic blood flow might act body 's nutrition handle [ 8 ] . Bariatric surgeries grow field treatment choice morbid obesity ( BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2 ) . Most established procedure Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) , duodenum proximal jejunum bypass . Clinical research evidence show shortly ( significant weight loss ) RYGB , T2DM resolve improve glucose tolerance . Foregut hypothesis behind bariatric surgery postulate , bypass portion intestine contain substance , act anti-incretin¬ , ie . counteract metabolically favourable incretins . In view recent study , may GIP really anti-incretin behind hypothesis . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) modern image technique , use study perfusion metabolism different organ non-invasively . When radiowater measurement combine [ 15O ] CO , tissue specific perfusion blood volume measure , respectively . When couple magnetic imaging ( ie . PET-MRI ) , volumes-of-interests accurately draw desired organ . The current study conduct investigate vasoactive role GIP . We aim show GIP major contributor blood flow tissue blood volume observe postprandial state . Moreover , hypothesize elimination GIP-effect central role improve intermediary metabolism observe bariatric surgery procedure , part change mediate change splanchnic circulation . Furthermore , investigate effect GLP-1 ( glucagon-like peptide 1 , another member incretin family ) splanchnic circulation . In present study intestinal , hepatic pancreatic blood flow volume measure use [ 15O ] H2O- [ 15O ] CO radiotracers PET-MRI image healthy normal weight volunteer ( n = 20 , BMI ≤ 27 kg/m2 ) morbidly obese T2DM patient ( n = 30 , BMI ≤ 35 kg/m2 ) bariatric surgery operation . The PET imaging perform fast state also separately either 1 ) mixed meal solution ( MMS ) , 2 ) GIP- , 3 ) GLP-1-infusion . Also abdominal subcutaneous visceral adipose tissue , intestinal hepatic tissue sample collect .</detailed_description>
