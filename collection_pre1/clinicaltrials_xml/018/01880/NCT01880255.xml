	<brief_summary>In study , investigator examine effect repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) memory deficit individual schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder . Half study participant choose chance receive active rTMS stimulation half choose chance receive sham rTMS . Sham rTMS feel active rTMS direct brain stimulation . This necessary ensure active rTMS efficacious enhancement memory individual schizophrenia . Based result recently publish pilot study , investigator propose active rTMS treatment result significant improvement work memory performance compare sham rTMS treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study randomize , double blind , sham control study evaluate efficacy repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation treatment work memory deficit individual schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder 18 59 year age . The study duration approximately 3 month , rTMS session last 4 week , 5 time week , 1 hour . Several scale use assess symptom severity part clinical assessment . Cognition assess use validated battery N-back task . This study also involve type brain image know magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) begin end 4 week daily rTMS good understand effect rTMS brain structure function . Investigators measure size connection different part brain ass brain structure blood flow complete basic task assess brain function . We also collect two blood sample ( rTMS treatment ) see certain protein change response treatment . Finally , analysis genetic material conduct see gene play role difference people respond treatment .</detailed_description>
