	<brief_summary>Developing MRI protocol 1.5 T allow quantification hematopoietic , fatty trabecular moiety marrow . An ideal protocol would differentiate red marrow neoplastic cellular infiltration , detect loss trabecular bone . This study assess feasibility multiple gradient echo sequence differentiation water fat constituent marrow , combine T2* map interrogate trabecular component The investigator hypothesize technique allow good identification lesion type routine MR sequence , use quantitatively characterize myelomatous marrow replacement , iliac crest biopsy ( routinely perform diagnosis myeloma ) gold standard . Fluoro-deoxyglucose ( FDG ) /PET CT image detect FDG uptake active myeloma obtain routinely certain cohort patient myeloma . PET/CT commonly use initial whole body assessment monitoring remission . PET find 59 % sensitive 75 % specific detection myeloma . Myelomatous lesion detect MRI replacement marrow fat . Routine MRI however limit scope/field view , usually evaluate marrow single anatomic region ( extremity , pelvis spine ) . To assess diffuse marrow involvement MM , whole body MRI image potentiates near global assessment marrow , aid evaluate tumor burden , may useful staging .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Imaging pelvis bilateral femur 1.5 Tesla 30 minute research time `` slot '' NYU-FPO MRI , Tisch Hospital , NYU Medical Center , Department Radiology , HCC basement . This protocol utilize routine , Dixon sequence multi-echo MR `` spectroscopic '' sequence , allow quantization fat water trabecular moiety marrow . The opposed phase portion Dixon sequence aid differentiation dense red marrow metastatic deposit assay intravoxel fat . Diffusion sequence may also potentially improve specificity assess mobility water hypercellular hypocellular portion marrow , add protocol scan time permit . The new sequence conform FDA safety regulation regard static magnetic field , time vary magnetic field , specific absorption rate , acoustic noise level . However , since fully validate diagnostic accuracy , result image analyze research purpose use patient 's diagnostic assessment .</detailed_description>
