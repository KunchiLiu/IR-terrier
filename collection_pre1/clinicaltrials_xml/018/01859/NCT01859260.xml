	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) common undertreated condition patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . Both physiologic empiric data suggest renal hypoxia due OSA associate worsen kidney function . Hospitalized patient often expose multiple nephrotoxin antibiotic , contrast agent , diuretic , place risk acute worsen kidney function . This study aim determine whether immediate diagnosis treatment OSA CKD patient decrease incidence acute kidney injury hospitalization . The investigator evaluate extent effect attribute decrease nocturnal hypoxia improve blood pressure control . Secondary endpoint include hospital length stay , composite outcome comprise hemodialysis initiation , major cardiovascular event , mortality .</brief_summary>
