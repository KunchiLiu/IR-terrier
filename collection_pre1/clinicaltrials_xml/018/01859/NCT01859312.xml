	<brief_summary>Background : - Congenital adrenal hyperplasia ( CAH ) genetic disorder adrenal gland . The adrenal gland locate abdomen produce small amount hormone cortisol , aldosterone , androgen . These hormone help control blood pressure , protect body , maintain good health , especially development . People CAH make enough cortisol aldosterone , make much androgen . This lead serious medical problem . The standard treatment take pill mimic effect cortisol aldosterone . However , treatment pill long-term side effect higher dos need , may work well people . - A possible new treatment CAH use pump deliver cortisol skin . Similar pump often use give insulin people diabetes . Researchers think cortisol pump might able help body use cortisol effectively take pill . They want compare result cortisol pump standard pill treatment CAH . Objectives : - To compare effectiveness cortisol pump standard cortisol pill therapy CAH . Eligibility : - Men woman least 18 year age CAH ( see detail Eligibility section ) . Design : - This study involve four inpatient hospital stay National Institutes Health Bethesda , MD 6 month ( space 2 month apart ) . The first last stay last 5 day . The second third stay last 3 day . - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . - At first study visit , participant provide regular blood urine sample . They also image study . These study look bone , fat , muscle abdomen pelvis . - Participants receive cortisol pump first visit . They show use pump . They also learn , need take extra `` stress dose '' cortisol pill . - At second third visit , cortisol dose give pump adjust need . Blood urine sample also collect . No image study schedule visit . - The last study visit test first visit . Participants offer chance continue pump treatment 1 year , go back standard pill treatment . Study type : Interventional non-randomized trial Official title : A Pilot Study Assessing use Continuous Subcutaneous Hydrocortisone Infusion In Treatment Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia Estimated enrollment : 8 Study Start Date : May 2013 Estimated Study Completion Date : December 2016 Sponsoring Institute : National Institute Child Health Human Development &lt; TAB &gt; ELIGIBILITY Inclusion criteria 1 . Men woman 18 year age old classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia ( 21-Hydroxylase deficiency ) 2 . High adrenal androgen blood , 3 . One follow condition : obesity , fatty liver , risk diabetes , low bone mass , inability tolerate cortisol pill Exclusion criterion 1 . Pregnancy 2 . Breast feed 3 . Use inhaled oral steroid diseases CAH 4 . Use estrogen-containing birth control pills 5 . Use medicines cross-react hydrocortisone 6 . Use stress dose steroid illness last 30 day prior join study</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Cortisol Pump With Standard Treatment Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Congenital adrenal hyperplasia ( CAH ) common genetic endocrine disorder , 21-hydroxylase enzyme deficiency account 95 % case . 21-hydroxylase deficiency present spectrum clinical manifestation range salt-wasting virilization female neonate ( classic CAH ) symptomatic ( precocious puberty , short stature , acne ) asymptomatic hyperandrogenemia ( non-classic CAH ) . Classic CAH characterize impaired cortisol mineralocorticoid biosynthesis , trigger adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) hyper-secretion accumulation adrenal androgen . Glucocorticoid treatment patient classic CAH focus cortisol replacement prevention ACTH-driven androgen excess . Current conventional glucocorticoid treatment regimen ( short long-acting agent dose , twice thrice daily ) fail simulate physiological cortisol secretion suppress adrenal androgen overproduction , without supraphysiologic replacement . Short-term overtreatment glucocorticoid lead iatrogenic Cushing syndrome long-term use associate development obesity , visceral adiposity , insulin resistance osteoporosis . Isolated case report provide evidence continuous subcutaneous hydrocortisone infusion ( CSHI ) mimic physiologic cortisol release lead improve CAH control dose similar low traditional treatment . This pilot study aim test hypothesis difficult-to-treat adult patient classic CAH well adrenal androgen control improve CAH glucocorticoid-related comorbidities , receive near-physiologic cortisol replacement therapy via CSHI compare conventional glucocorticoid treatment . In addition , study provide information safety tolerability CSHI , generate data use design future pediatric study .</detailed_description>
