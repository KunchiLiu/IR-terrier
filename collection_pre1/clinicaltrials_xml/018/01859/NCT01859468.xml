	<brief_summary>Amorphical strong basis believe Amorphous Calcium Carbonate ( ACC ) product effect active mineralization bone remodelling hence , potential accelerate fracture heal process . The active mineralization probably attribute mineral component substance . The distal radius fracture choose model test effect ACC treatment include trabecular cortical bone , accessible radiograph , little soft tissue distort radiograph , amenable multiple functional endpoint . Primary objective : To assess efficacy treatment calcium ACC compare placebo radiographic healing time subject distal radius fracture . Secondary objective : - To evaluate effect ACC compare placebo improvement wrist functional outcome follow distal radius fracture . - To evaluate safety profile ACC population</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Effect Amorphous Calcium Carbonate ( ACC ) Healing Time Distal Radius Fractures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible subject treat follow : Fifty ( 50 ) subject randomly assign one two group ( N=25 ) . Subjects treatment group receive amorphous calcium carbonate ( ACC ) active control group receive placebo . Both formulation supplement vitamin D. Safety parameter evaluate throughout trial . Subjects admit Barzilai medical center hand clinic follow new distal radius fracture routinely evaluate . Subjects initially treat accord current practice fracture management , ( i.e . ; radiographic evaluation fracture fixation splint plaster Paris ) , candidate surgery aim non-invasive treatment , consider candidate trial invite clinical research center ( CRC ) screening . Screening ( Day -7 ) - Subjects sign informed consent form ( ICF ) . Chemistry hematology test perform : sodium , potassium , hemoglobin , sedimentation rate , leukocytes calcium ( total , albumin-corrected ) , phosphate , alkaline phosphatase , creatinine , albumin . Also , serum parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) , 25-hydroxyvitamin D , thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) test . Urinary excretion calcium creatinine measure . General health examine medical history physical examination . Eligible subject , comply inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion enrol study . Subjects inform phone site whether eligible enter study . Visit 1 - 1 week fracture - ( Day 0 ( -7/+1 ) ) - Eligible subject invite CRC . A fixture device apply cast ensure consistence image . X-ray perform exclude loss reduction . Subjects randomly receive pack tablet ( total 180 tablet , 42 day supply + 12 spare tablet ) , either tablet contain 200 mg elemental calcium ACC placebo ( 300 mg StarLac ( starch cellulose lactose blend ) ) . Subjects arrive prior day 0 instructed begin treatment exactly 7 day fracture event . Subjects instruct take 4 tablet day first 6 week ( day 0-42 ) , 2 tablet morning 2 tablet even , meal ( i.e. , study group consume total 800mg elemental calcium per day ) . To minimize risk calcium related side effect , subject take calcium regularly , instruct discontinue calcium supplement intake throughout trial . Visit 2 - 4 week fracture - ( Day 21±1 ) - Pre-dose serum calcium concentration measure . The cast remove control entero posterior lateral x-ray take . Functional assessment ( pain-free grip force plate ) measurement questionnaire ( VAS , DASH ) perform . The wrist fix use adjustable brace . Subjects ask side effect adverse event ( AEs ) may occur . Subjects complete TSQM questionnaire representative CRC . Visit 3 - 7 week fracture - ( Day 42±1 ) - Pre-dose serum calcium concentration urinary calcium creatinine concentration measure . Controlled entero posterior lateral x-ray take without brace . Functional assessment ( pain-free grip force plate ) measurement questionnaire ( VAS , DASH ) perform . Subjects receive additional pack capsule , ( total 180 capsule , 42 day supply + 12 spare capsule ) formulation receive day 0 : either tablet contain 200 mg elemental calcium ACC placebo ( 300 mg StarLac ( starch cellulose lactose blend ) ) . Subjects instructed take 4 tablet day next 6 week ( day 42-84 ) 2 tablet morning 2 tablet even , meal ( i.e. , study group consume total 800mg elemental calcium per day ) . To minimize risk calcium related side effect , subject take calcium regularly , instruct discontinue calcium supplement intake throughout trial . Subjects show radiographic heal x-ray invited additional radiographic assessment day 56 . Visit 4 - 9 week fracture - ( Day 56±1 ) * - Controlled entero posterior lateral x-ray take without brace . Functional assessment ( pain-free grip force plate ) measurement questionnaire ( VAS , DASH ) perform . Subjects ask side effect AEs may occur . Subjects show radiographic heal x-ray invited additional radiographic assessment day 70 . Visit 5 - 11 week fracture - ( Day 70±1 ) * - Controlled entero posterior lateral x-ray take without brace . Functional assessment ( pain-free grip force plate ) measurement questionnaire ( VAS , DASH ) perform . Subjects ask side effect AEs may occur . Visit 6 - 13 week fracture - ( Day 84±1 ) - Pre-dose serum calcium 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration urinary calcium creatinine concentration measure . Controlled entero posterior lateral x-ray take . Functional assessment ( pain-free grip force plate ) measurement questionnaire ( VAS , DASH ) perform . Subjects ask side effect AEs may occur . Subjects complete TSQM questionnaire representative CRC . The subject instruct discontinue study treatment administration . Subjects discontinue regularly calcium supplementation begin study instruct continue regular dose intake . Visit 7 - 24 week fracture - ( Day 161±1 ) - Serum calcium concentration urinary calcium creatinine concentration measure . Functional assessment ( pain-free grip force plate ) measurement questionnaire ( VAS , DASH ) perform . Subjects ask side effect AEs may occur . * Only subject show radiographic heal x-ray perform previous visit .</detailed_description>
