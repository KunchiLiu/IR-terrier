	<brief_summary>Background : - Uveitis age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) two type eye disease related inflammation eye . However , cause disease fully understood . Researchers want look bacteria body might relate inflammation . They study natural bacteria present gut intestine people uveitis AMD learn might trigger disease . Objectives : - To study gut intestinal bacteria people AMD uveitis . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age quiet ( non-inflamed ) uveitis . - Individuals least 18 year age active ( inflame ) uveitis require additional treatment . - Individuals least 18 year age uveitis AMD immune system therapy National Eye Institute . Design : - Participants quiet uveitis one study visit . Participants active uveitis two study visit . The second visit 4 6 month first visit . Participants uveitis AMD immune system therapy two visit . The first start therapy , second visit 4 6 month start therapy . - About 12 hour study visit , participant give enema home . This clear low intestine specimen collection . - At visit , participant full eye examination , include vision eye pressure test . They provide blood sample test . They also anoscopy collect rectal fluid study colon lining . - Treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : What precipitate ocular inflammatory episode remain unknown possible potentiate factor microbiome . The microbiome become increasingly studied advent new technique , apply uveitis . We wish evaluate microbiome composition patient ocular inflammatory disease uveitis agerelated macular degeneration ( AMD ) , may standard therapy receive orally administer tolerizing antigen therapy . Study Population : A total 65 participant enrol study . Of participant , goal enroll 15 participant treat , quiet uveitis , 15 participant active uveitis require additional systemic therapy 15 participant uveitis AMD participate oral tolerance study NEI . Participants must least 18 year old . Microbiome sample exist control population healthy volunteer establish Dr. Jonathan Braun UCLA use comparison microbiome sample obtain participant study . Peripheral blood sample exist control population healthy volunteer establish NEI LI use comparison peripheral blood sample obtain participant study . No healthy volunteer recruit study . Design : This observational , cross-sectional , single-center study . Participants receive complete ocular examination clinical testing determine clinically undergo anoscopy collection rectal fluid specimen . Participants quiet uveitis one study visit ; participant active uveitis require additional systemic therapy participant participate oral tolerance study NEI two study visit . Outcome Measures : The outcome relate comparison various microbiome sample control group . In addition , comparison make finding immunome .</detailed_description>
