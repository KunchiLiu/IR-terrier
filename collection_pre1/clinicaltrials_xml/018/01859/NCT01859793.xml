	<brief_summary>The study perform determine whether sitagliptin , dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor , acutely chronically improve blood vessel function . Patients type 2 diabetes metformin enrol study 22 week double blind cross study receive sitagliptin pill day 8 week separate 8 week receive match placebo pill . The treatment period divide 4 week period . Blood vessel function measure ultrasound single dose sitagliptin placebo , well 8 week treatment . Blood also take measure blood marker inflammation time ultrasound perform .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We plan recruit 38 patient T2DM single center , double blind randomize , interventional crossover trial compare sitagliptin ( 100 mg/day ) match placebo . We choose placebo comparator study goal determine whether sitagliptin improves glycemic control endothelial function , property share popular class agent like sulfonylurea . Subjects randomize 1:1 allocation ratio either sitagliptin 1st placebo 1st . The study 5 total visit . Subjects pass phone screen invite screen visit study eligibility ( Visit 1 ) Informed consent review ; unique study number assign write informed consent obtain ( subject assign 1 allocation number ) ; relevant participant medical history record include currently prescribe medication ; anthropometric measurement take ( height , weight , waist circumference metric unit ) blood pressure record ( measure triplicate average ) . Subjects allowed take blood pressure medication morning screen visit , morning study visit limit acute influence medication endothelial function . If potential participant qualifies study , he/she randomize either receive sitagliptin 1st ( 100 mg/day ) match placebo . Prior receive either set pill , subject return study center within approximately 1-2 week screen visit undergo initial test endothelial function receive pill . Prior study visit except screen , subject also ask refrain vigorous physical activity ( weight lifting , jog activity vigorous walk ) 24 hour reduce risk fast hypoglycemia study visit . Subjects also ask fast 6-8 hour prior visit limit acute dietary influence vascular endothelial function . At Visit 2 , endothelial function determine brachial artery reactivity test prior follow single dose 100 mg sitagliptin match placebo depend arm subject randomize . Blood sample also take visit systemic measurement endothelial cell activation/inflammation ( VCAM-1 ICAM-1 ) prior 2 hour follow acute drug administration . These measure indicate time point use commercially available kit . Endothelial function , like blood sample , measure prior medication administration 2 hour follow medication administration brachial artery reactivity test described Section D.3 . The 2 hour time choose give plasma level sitagliptin appear peak 2 hour follow dose administration.32 At end visit , subject give 9 week supply study pill ( sitagliptin match placebo ) dispense Froedtert Hospital Investigational Pharmacy , schedule return Visit 3 approximately 8 week follow Visit 2 . Subjects ask take study medication 24 hour prior Visit 3 . At Visit 3 , subject undergo repeat test endothelial function . Following study visit , subject remain study pill return Visit 4 approximately 4 week follow Visit 3 . Visit 4 repeat Visit 2 except subject receive set pill randomize receive second . Subjects return study center Visit 5 approximately 8 week Visit 4 . Visit 5 identical Visit 3 . Subject adherence determine pill count perform MCW Translational Research Unit nursing staff perform pill accounting . All medication dispensation handle Froedtert Hospital Investigational Drug Pharmacy .</detailed_description>
