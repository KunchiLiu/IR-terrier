	<brief_title>Nutrigenomics : Personalizing Weight Loss Obese Veterans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About 35 % veteran obese . The MOVE ! program nation-wide 8-week program group class nationally help obese veteran lose weight . While program successful veteran , 75 % veteran unable lose ≥5 % weight 24 week MOVE ! New method need help obese veteran seek weight loss . Using personalized genomic information dictate specific diet , information exercise eating behavior , may one mean help promote weight loss . Just single nucleotide change polymorphism ( SNP ) gene increase person 's risk obesity , change lipid profile response consumption different macronutrients fat carbohydrate . Over 54 genetic locus associate obesity phenotypes clinical study report association SNPs and/or functional alteration gene expression ( epigenetics ) ability lose weight . We implement randomized clinical trial test set genomic data call FIT™ test ( Pathway Genomics™ ) contain information SNPs affect obesity risk , confer specific diet recommendation , outline eat behavior suggest response various exercise regimen . The overall goal project evaluate supplemental genetic information genomically-derived diet build around package meal improve adherence , parallel MOVE ! program VA San Diego , promote weight loss obese veteran receive usual care eat diet base around package meal . Our primary hypothesis obese veteran MOVE ! program lose 5 % weight receive personalize genomic information genomically-derived diet build around package meal compare veteran program receive usual care MOVE ! package meal 8 24 week . We also hypothesize veteran genomic group lose 5 % weight loss 8 week maintain weight loss 24 week compare veteran usual care group .</detailed_description>
