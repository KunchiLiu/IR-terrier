	<brief_title>Selumetinib Akt Inhibitor MK-2206 Treating Patients With Refractory Advanced Gallbladder Bile Duct Cancer That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate objective response rate ( complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] ) , define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) 1.1 criterion , patient refractory advanced biliary cancer receive combination AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate ( selumetinib ) MK-2206 ( Akt inhibitor MK-2206 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall progression-free survival patient refractory advance biliary cancer receive MK-2206 AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate . II . To determine frequency severity adverse event tolerability AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate + MK-2206 patient advance refractory biliary cancer receive regimen . III . To evaluate effect AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate plus MK-2206 inflammatory cytokine immune cell profile well cancer cachexia . IV . To determine presence genetic mutation phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase ( PI3K ) /protein kinase B ( Akt ) mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signal pathway gene ( v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog [ BRAF ] V600E ) relevant biliary cancer correlate may predict objective response treatment AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate MK-2206 . V. To assess validate target inhibition patient refractory advance biliary cancer receive combination MK-2206 plus AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate . VI . To determine pharmacogenetic profile way assess inter-individual variability well relate clinical outcome . VII . To determine genetic variant mutation gene encode drug metabolize enzyme transporter , gene involve tumor biology , may relate response treatment . VIII . To evaluate effect combine MAPK PI3K/Akt inhibition skeletal muscle anabolism patient receive treatment AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate MK-2206 . IX . To conduct quality life analyse patient receive combination AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate plus MK-2206 . OUTLINE : Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK-2206 orally ( PO ) day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 ( day 8 , 15 , 22 course 1 ) selumetinib PO day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
