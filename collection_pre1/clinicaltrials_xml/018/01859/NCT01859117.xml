	<brief_summary>This clinical study conduct assess safety determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) PDA-002 [ human placenta-derived cell ] administer low leg muscle subject peripheral arterial disease diabetic foot ulcer . It look see PDA-002 help reduce symptom PAD and/or improve ulcer heal . This study also help find best dose PDA-002 use future study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Human Placenta-derived Cells ( PDA002 ) Evaluate Safety Effectiveness Subjects With PAD DFU</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study determine safe dose PDA-002 [ human placenta-derived cell ] study . This dose-escalation study four dose level enroll three six subject . Doses range 3 million 100 million cell . If one dose consider safe treated subject evaluate review , next group subject enrol receive next high dose . This continue either high dose reach , least 2 subject dose level ≥ Grade 2 allergic reaction suspect related PDA-002 2 subject dose level experience unexpected , treatment-related serious adverse event dose limit toxicity within 14 day follow initial dose PDA-002 . This open-label study subject take study drug study personnel know dose subject receives .</detailed_description>
