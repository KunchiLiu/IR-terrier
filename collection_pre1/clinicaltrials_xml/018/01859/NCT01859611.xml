	<brief_title>TriActive+ Radiofrequency ( RF ) Non-Invasive Treatment Wrinkles Rhytides</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Collagen varies genetically structurally . Collagen breakdown increase chronological age photoaging . While fibroblast normally replace damage collagen fiber new one , ability fibroblast replace collagen compromise natural age environmental stress . Although collagen fiber form loose interlacing network deformable , increased collagen breakdown lead thin loss elastic fiber network dermis . This breakdown result formation wrinkle , especially area skin expose sun , prone wrinkle imperfection . Nonablative dermal remodeling gain tremendous popularity among patient practitioner , offer low incidence adverse effect modest improvement various sign cutaneous photoaging , include rhytides , dyschromias telangiectasias . Controlled thermal skin injury show effect conformational change structure length collagen may also induce fibroblast response long-term collagen remodel . Interest utilizing radiofrequency energy enhance deep tissue tighten thus improve skin laxity grow , radiofrequency energy show multiple study tighten tissue , produce noticeable skin lifting . This study intend evaluate clinical performance radiofrequency ( RF ) source engender TriActive+ RF non-invasive treatment wrinkle rhytides . Eligible subject sign ICF receive 8 treatment least two facial sub area ( leave peri-orbital , right peri-orbital peri-oral ) . Up 25 subject enrol study two site . Treatments start low power gradually increase , base tolerability tissue reaction . The goal progressively reach maintain epidermal temperature end-point . The site use IR thermometer ensure rise temperature exceed 43Â° C. Treatments week follow-up visit one week , one month , three month follow final treatment . Clinical assessment investigator digital photograph take prior baseline treatment , immediately prior 5th treatment , 1 week , 1 month 3 month follow-up visit .</detailed_description>
