	<brief_title>Melanoma Simulation Model With Smartphone Devices : Training Physicians Early Detection Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Age-adjusted melanoma incidence among Caucasians rise 7.5 21.9 case per 100,000 represent increase nearly 200 % 30 year . In contrast cancer ( i.e . colorectal , prostate , cervical ) , melanoma detect intentional visual skin inspection . Intentional screen deliberate visual inspection cutaneous surface . However , few 30 % primary care physician ( PCPs ) report train skin cancer medical education . Early detection melanoma PCPs expect improve without address PCPs ' lack training low confidence examination skill pertain pigmented lesion exam . A focused intervention require improve PCPs ' early detection melanoma mitigate near-term consequence age US population . Opportunistic surveillance require skill unaided visual inspection skin dermoscopy lesion . Dermoscopy—a hand-held magnifying device assist diagnosis—reduces number unnecessary biopsy improve clinical sensitivity diagnose melanoma . Studies show Australian PCPs train use `` three-point checklist dermoscopy , '' develop biopsy ratio benign malignant lesion 8:1 general population , comparable dermatologist use dermoscopy . In 2009 , American Academy Family Physicians hold first dermoscopy course Annual Scientific Meeting , continue demand similar course . By make dermoscopy customary PCPs , PCPs able detect melanoma opportunistically render care at-risk population elderly provide care . Smart-touchscreen technology potentially provide safe environment medical trainee learn procedural screening skill rarely available opportunity clinic . As , technology may lead good health outcome future population . In study , eighty 3rd year medical thirty 1st year physician 's assistant student participate visual screening dermoscopy curriculum aim improve retention rate learn clinical skill . After didactic lecture melanoma screening , participant randomize either control experimental study arm clinical skill workshop . The control arm represent previously publish clinical skill train workshop ( IRB STU 0002705 ) participant interact simulated patient model present pigment lesion review dermoscopy image projector screen . In experimental arm , projector-based learn approach replace handheld touchscreen device ( smartphone ) preloaded interactive melanoma screen tutorial . The smartphone provide instant feedback remediation improper clinical management decision . Across group , learn content remain similar . Further deliberate practice question provide control arm standardize experimental arm 's question individualize base weakness determine smartphone software .</detailed_description>
