	<detailed_description>The prevalence severe pediatric obesity rise youth condition elevate risk develop chronic disease cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . Lifestyle modification therapy alone ineffective adolescent severe obesity patient qualify bariatric surgery . Many patient would likely benefit pharmacotherapy one medication ( orlistat ) approve use adolescent notable side effect limit efficacy impede clinical use . Topiramate , medication approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment seizures adult child , associate weight loss . Although FDA approve treatment obesity , study obese adult demonstrate weight reduction approximately 5 % 6-12 month therapy . However , weight loss effect topiramate never evaluate among child adolescent . Therefore , goal pilot study evaluate safety efficacy 24 week topiramate therapy 4-week run-in meal replacement therapy adolescent severe obesity . This 28-week , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , pilot clinical trial meal replacement therapy ( 4 week ) follow topiramate ( 24 week ) vs. meal replacement therapy ( 4 week ) follow placebo ( 24 week ) BMI reduction cardiometabolic risk factor improvement 36 adolescent ( age 12-17 year old ) severe obesity . Monthly lifestyle modification/behavioral counseling deliver train study coordinator patient group . The lifestyle modification education material give patient select section discuss monthly contact ( five face-to-face session three phone session ) . The primary object evaluate effect meal replacement therapy follow topiramate vs. meal replacement therapy follow placebo percent change BMI among adolescent severe obesity . The primary hypothesis 4 week meal replacement therapy follow 24 week topiramate large average percent decline BMI baseline 28 week compare meal replacement therapy follow placebo . The secondary objective characterize safety profile topiramate treatment adolescent obesity , evaluate effect meal replacement therapy follow topiramate vs. meal replacement therapy follow placebo risk factor CVD T2DM , evaluate response topiramate treatment base baseline eat behavior phenotype adolescent severe obesity . The secondary hypothesis 4 week meal replacement therapy follow 24 week topiramate significantly reduce average absolute BMI , absolute percent body weight , percent total body visceral fat , systolic blood pressure , fast triglyceride insulin , compare meal replacement therapy follow placebo , presence binge eat disorder characteristic baseline associate great reduction BMI topiramate treatment .</detailed_description>
