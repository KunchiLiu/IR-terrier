	<brief_title>MRI , Cone Beam CT , Fan Beam CT Detecting Soft Tissue Patients With Prostate Lung Cancer Undergoing Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Establish technical feasibility MRI perform functional soft-tissue target radiotherapy pelvis thorax . ( Group I ) II . Acquire clinical MR image data evaluate image quality tradeoff operational parameter setting . ( Group I ) III . Validate selection MRI technique factor compare visibility soft tissue structure MRIs , cone beam ( CB ) CTs fan beam ( FB ) CTs patient . ( Group II ) IV . Assess feasibility use deformable image registration map contour FBCT MRI , CBCT MRI , MRI MRI vice versa . ( Group II ) V. Compare morphologic functional change target normal structure , visualize MRI , CBCT FBCT image , response radiation therapy identify opportunity treatment adaptation . ( Group II ) OUTLINE : Patients undergo MRI FBCT baseline , within first 3 week radiotherapy week 4 6 radiotherapy . Patients lung cancer may undergo 4 dimensional ( 4D ) CBCT day second third MRI FBCT .</detailed_description>
