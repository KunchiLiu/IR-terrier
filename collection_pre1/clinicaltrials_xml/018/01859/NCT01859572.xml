	<brief_summary>The rationale study facilitate future Phase II/III clinical trial improve outcome patient suffer residual disability ischaemic stroke . Main study objective document good define prognostic characteristic residual disability patient follow ischaemic stroke , inform design small efficient Phase II study screen potentially efficacious intervention signal activity merit development establish pool patient may approach participate future clinical trial ischaemic stroke setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Experience conduct Phase I study advanced medicinal therapy ischaemic stroke plan Phase II efficacy study indication reveal number opportunity facilitate future clinical trial important indication . Two key issue identify could easily address forward plan future trial ischaemic clinical setting : - The population readily available clinical trial potentially useful new agent limit , many patient present stroke treat acute unit may `` drop-out '' acute neurology academic catchment population transfer variety setting subsequent management , long-term hospital care geriatric ward , residential care home care relatives assistance social support . Thus , establish pool patient willing contacted future clinical trial leave acute stroke facility would facilitate future stroke study . It would ensure patient offer opportunity participate relevant clinical trial additional relate care ( e.g . additional physiotherapy ) . - Despite substantial amount literature management stroke , plan Phase II study still handicap insufficient information clearly identify patient leave residual disability time-course improvement current standard care . Optimal population clinical trial methodology screen potential new intervention stroke establish . Building robust dataset well identify population would : 1 ) improve speed reduce cost screening candidate , 2 ) permit use efficient statistical method screen activity , 3 ) increase opportunity identify new treatment post stroke disability . A core dataset record include patient 's National Health Service number , age , gender stroke outcome measure four standard validate rating scale ; Action Research Arm Test ( ARAT ) , National Institute Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) , modify Rankin Scale ( mRS ) Barthel Index ( BI ) . All patient consent participate program would also consent contacted determine interest participate future regulate clinical trial intervention patient history ischaemic stroke . The consent form study would make clear patient obligation participate study . In addition core dataset , participate centre may elect add additional sub-protocols study collect additional non-core data : example , assessment cognitive visual function , mood , fatigue measure performance , structural functional MRI image investigation related patient 's progress follow present stroke . Additional assessment criterion outside core dataset study would subject centre-specific sub-protocols must approve required national local requirement . Co-recruitment patient study allowable , permit within study protocol .</detailed_description>
