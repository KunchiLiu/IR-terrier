	<brief_title>Identification Optimal Stimulation Site Cervical Dystonia Symptoms : An Exploratory Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose use repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) distinct premotor area patient cervical dystonia ( CD ) goal improve symptom reduce unwanted side effect . The knowledge gain propose research identify specific premotor area target rTMS expect result novel intervention could enhance replace current treatment CD . rTMS could include adjunct treatment botulinum toxin could sustain treatment effect decrease frequency re-injection , potentially result cost saving without decrease symptom control . In addition medical cost reduction , improve quality life could expect successful development therapy extend dystonia symptom control . rTMs FDA-approved treatment depression proposal use even low stimulation rate , suggest continue use within clearly safe parameter . Successful completion research could lead rapid adoption therapeutic modality . We test hypothesis rTMS distinct premotor site provide effective treatment CD non-specific activation entire premotor region . This do performing randomize , observer-blinded exploratory pilot study determine optimal site rTMS various site premotor motor cortex improve symptom cervical dystonia . Completion aim lead development target TMS therapy CD .</detailed_description>
