	<criteria>Eligible patient histologic cytologic diagnosis NSCLC advance stage ( IV ) , know curative treatment option . Have biopsy proven KRAS EGFR mutation confirm Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA ) certify lab ( required Phase IB expansion cohort ) . For Phase I/Ib enrollment , Patients CLIA confirm EGFR mutation may treatment na√Øve . All patient must receive least one previous line therapy . There limit prior line treatment Phase 1 portion . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status either 0 1 There limit prior line treatment Phase 1 portion . At least one measurable site disease ( define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ) , disease specific response assessment criterion , appropriate ( RECIST 1.1 ) . Have discontinue previous systemic therapy recover side effect due systemic treatment 14 day prior start treatment . Have discontinue previous biologic therapy recover side effect due biologic treatment 14 day prior start treatment . Have discontinue previous external beam radiation therapy recover side effect due radiation therapy 14 day prior start treatment . Have archival tissue available willing undergo repeat biopsy . Negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hour prior first study dose woman childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) . Adequate organ function lab parameter Prior screen invasive procedure , write informed consent must obtain . Does adequate cardiac function Patients documented central nervous system leptomeningeal metastasis ( brain metastasis ) time study entry . Patients prior brain metastasis may consider complete treatment brain metastasis , long require corticosteroid , asymptomatic . Any serious uncontrolled medical disorder active infection would impair patient 's ability receive study treatment Prior use MEK162 concurrent use approve anticancer investigational agent . Patients treat prior EGFR TKI therapy ( include erlotinib ) allow enroll . Gastrointestinal disease precludes absorption History current evidence central serous retinopathy ( CSR ) retinal vein occlusion ( RVO ) Any ophthalmopathy visible screen would consider risk factor CSR RVO ophthalmologist History another malignancy within 2 year , except cure basal cell carcinoma skin excise carcinoma situ cervix Patients receive prior anticancer treatment within follow time frame : systemic therapy less 14 day prior start treatment ; radiation therapy le 14 day prior start treatment ; biologic therapy le 14 day prior start treatment . Patients recover side effect prior anticancer treatment less equal grade 1 toxicity accord Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Effects ( CTCAE ) v.4 within follow time frame : Received previous systemic therapy recover side effect 14 day prior start treatment ; Received previous radiation therapy recover side effect 14 day prior start treatment ; Received previous biologic therapy recover side effect 14 day prior start treatment Have undergone major surgery &lt; 4 week initiation study medication recover side effect procedure Patients concurrent uncontrolled medical condition may interfere participation study potentially affect interpretation study data Women pregnant nursing Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) males sterilize vasectomy mean partner WOCBP , UNLESS woman use two birth control method . The two method double barrier method barrier method plus hormonal method .
