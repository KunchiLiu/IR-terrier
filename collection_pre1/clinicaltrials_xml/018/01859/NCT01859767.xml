	<brief_summary>This Phase 1 , single center , open-label , non-randomized , clinical study probable AD patient HVs evaluate efficacy , safety tolerability single dose MNI-672 . The underlying goal study assess MNI-672 SPECT image tool detect ß amyloid deposition brain AD research participant young healthy male subject . All study procedure conduct Molecular NeuroImaging ( MNI ) New Haven , CT . Approximately 3 patient AD 3 young male HVs recruit participate study . HVs screen ensure evidence cognitive decline significant neurological deficit . All eligible subject require visit study center least 2 occasion : 1. one screening visit include history physical examination , laboratory extensive neuro-psychological test MRI brain scanning . AD subject also undergo Amyvid PET image part Screening Visit . 2. one day baseline examination MNI-672 administration subsequent SPECT scanning- follow safety measure</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To determine diagnostic efficacy MNI-672 SPECT scan differentiate patient probable AD HVs basis neocortical tracer bind pattern , SPECT scan visually assess nuclear physician experience field neuro-imaging . SPECT scan finding classify either abnormal ( i.e. , significant neocortical uptake predefined region ) normal ( i.e . significant neocortical uptake predefined region ) . The visual analysis MNI SPECT image compare clinical diagnosis Amyvid PET image result determine efficacy MNI-672 agent detect B-amyloid . The nuclear physician evaluate SPECT image unaware clinical diagnosis .</detailed_description>
