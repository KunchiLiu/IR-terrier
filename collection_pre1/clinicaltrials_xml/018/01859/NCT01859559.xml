	<brief_summary>The primary objective randomize control trial ( RCT ) compare success rate obtain peripheral vascular access ultrasound guidance versus traditional , landmark approach among patient vary degree intravenous access difficulty . In addition compare overall initial success rate two method , also compare success rate degree intravenous access difficulty ( 3 main subject subgroup ) operator experience ( approximately 20 emergency department technician ) . The main hypothesis initial success rate significantly high ( 5 % great ) ultrasound guide peripheral intravenous access compare landmark approach among patient judge difficult intravenous access significant difference ( i.e . &lt; 5 % ) among patient judge easy intravenous access .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluate Initial Success Rate Ultrasound Guided Versus Landmark Approach For Peripheral Intravenous Access</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize control trial two group parallel design compare initial success rate peripheral intravenous line ( PIV ) placement traditional , landmark approach versus ultrasound guide . Emergency department ( ED ) patient treatment room require PIV line eligible study . For eligible , ED technician ED nurse complete clinical data sheet document degree IV access difficulty . For enroll , research assistant ( RA ) randomize subject one two treatment group : ( 1 ) ultrasound guide ; ( 2 ) landmark approach . The ED technician perform PIV placement base treatment group assign randomization process . The RA present PIV placement ask patient prior procedure factor may influence IV access ( i.e . self-reported weight height , presence chronic condition ) . The RA also document ED outcome procedure ( i.e . duration procedure , success failure , complication procedure ) query patient extent discomfort associate procedure . Finally , subject admit hospital , RA conduct follow-up PIV line determine long use ward reason take ( i.e . longer need , infection , infiltration , fell , etc ) . It hospital policy PIV line change every 72 hour prevent infection anticipate maximum follow-up ED PIV line place 72 hour . There two treatment group , ultrasound guide treatment group traditional , landmark group . For treatment group , tourniquet place upper extremity vein choose cannulation . For landmark approach , ED technician use standard anatomical landmark palpation puncture skin insert IV line . If patient randomize ultrasound group , operator use ultrasound help visualize vein direct line placement . When use ultrasound , ED technicians employ one-person technique . For treatment group , first attempt fails , randomize subject one two treatment arm . We randomize second time failure first attempt good marker difficulty procedure . By randomize second time , able determine whether either method superior one fail attempt . After second fail attempt , ED technician use whatever method he/she choose place line . Because nature intervention , RCT unblinded .</detailed_description>
