	<brief_summary>The present study randomise control trial investigate effect short six week exercise training program rectal cancer patient follow neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy prior elective rectal cancer surgery . Twelve patient randomise ( 1:1 ) intervention control group . The patient randomize intervention group attend total 18 tailor exercise session ( Three 40 minute session six week ) 6 week chemoradiotherapy treatment . Where possible exercise training session arrange fit appointment hospital . Patients randomize control group unsupervised . They attend extra 3 session cardiopulmonary exercise test VO2 Kinetics test perform . Patients also invite attend 3 health relate quality life interview week 0 , 3 6 exercise programme . These appointment directly exercise session minimise hospital attendence . Following surgery routine clinically relevant observational data collect . These data relate hospital length stay , level care require follow surgery , post-operative morbidity survey ( POMS ) recovery process . Most information access patient note electronic patient record system . This subgroup RCT patient large interventional trial ( 6 control 6 exercise intervention patient ) ask consent separately 31-Phosphorus Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy ( 31P MRS ) scan blood sample . HYPOTHESIS 1 . Interval exercise training maintain improve fitness ( measure anaerobic threshold ) patient undergo neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy . 2 . Interval exercise training safe feasible patient undergo neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy await rectal cancer resection . 3 . Interval exercise training improve measure physical fitness measure CPET oxygen uptake kinetics test . 4 . Interval exercise training improve quality life patient undergo neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy . 5 . Improvements physical fitness reduce postoperative complication follow major rectal cancer surgery . 6 . Does physical activity , measure Sensewear Pro 3 activity monitor , decrease neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy decrease attenuate exercise training program ? 7 . Can find optimal time surgery fitness cancer downstaging best ? HYPOTHESIS Mechanism Pilot Study 1 . To explore exponential rate constant post-exercise phosphocreatine recovery . 2 . To explore alteration cellular mitochondrial energetics eg . Change mitochondrial number , change mitochondrial activity respiration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patient attend 5 set appointment hospital diagnostic test 3 appointment University Liverpool Magnetic Resonance Image Analysis Research Centre ( MARIARC ) . Three appointment prior chemoradiotherapy treatment , 4 chemoradiotherapy . Two 5 appointment part routine care . The first 4 appointment last hour . Patients complete 3 quality life questionnaire recruitment , chemotherapy , 4-6 week surgery . These 3 questionnaire take 20 minute fill . The fourth fifth appointment consist Computed Tomogram ( CT ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) scan radiology department ass cancer stag . These appointment last 1 hour 30 minute .</detailed_description>
