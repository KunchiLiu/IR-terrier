	<brief_summary>The University Sheffield one lead centre world basic translational research inhale gas MRI , provide lung image unprecedented spatial temporal resolution . Our previous work demonstrate inhaled gas MRI provide significant clinical information lung cancer radiotherapy plan post-treatment evaluation . Building upon unique experience , multidisciplinary team conduct inhale gas proton lung MRI study address two major clinical problem face lung cancer patient treat radiotherapy . 1 . Normal lung tissue often damage curative radiation dose . The investigator hypothesise regional ventilation-perfusion lung function image inhale gas proton MRI treatment help low risk radiation-induced lung injury help detect damage early stage . 2 . Identification extent cancerous tissue error-prone planning treatment CT image alone . The investigator hypothesise advanced proton MRI technique improve identification tumour volume , critical successfully target radiation dose . To achieve goal , image acquisition image processing method test study 20 patient . Results study make important contribution improve treatment lung disease one key research priority NHS .</brief_summary>
