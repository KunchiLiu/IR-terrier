	<brief_summary>Background : - People dystonia serious muscle contraction cause abnormal movement posture . This significantly affect daily life . The common type call organic . The type psychogenic . People type typical symptom plus psychological effect . Researchers look rapid transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) brain combined stimulation nerve affect ability detect sensation . They compare response people different type dystonia . They also compare response people dystonia response people without . This study may help u learn nature different type dystonia . Objectives : - To see whether TMS combine nerve stimulation affect brain differently people different type dystonia without dystonia . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year old , right-handed dystonia . - Healthy volunteer least 18 year old . Design : - Participants two clinical visit . Each visit hour long . They do day . - Participants screen medical history physical exam . - Participants take several sensory test . For test , electrode place skin . The participant feel small electric shock test . - Participants undergo TMS . For 2 minute , quick electrical current pass wire coil place head . As happens , researcher ask participant move certain muscle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To investigate effect pair brain peripheral nerve stimulation organic psychogenic dystonia see technique differentiate . Study Population : We intend internal pilot study 6 patient organic dystonia , 6 patient clinically definite psychogenic dystonia 6 age-matched healthy volunteer . We perform analysis see many subject need prove disprove difference group . Design : Subjects baseline screen visit , electromyography ( EMG ) nerve stimulation , sensory threshold testing , measurement brain excitability use motor evoke potential ( MEPs ) transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . They undergo rapid TMS repetitively pair stimulation nerve arm . Outcome variable measure immediately ( T0 ) , 30 minute ( T30 ) , 60 minute ( T60 ) end brain stimulation . Outcome Measures Primary outcome variable : Change MEP amplitudes T30 baseline Secondary outcome variable : - Input-output curve parameter ( measure baseline , T0 , T30 , T60 ) - Temporal discrimination threshold ( TDT ) Exploratory Measures - Short interval intracortical inhibition ( SICI ) , measure inhibition motor cortex - Influence Val66Met BDNF polymorphism output variable Repeated measure analyse variance ( ANOVA ) use investigate follow three factor outcome variable : time ( four level : baseline , T0 , T30 T60 ) muscle ( two level : APB FDI ) within-subject factor group ( three level : organic dystonia , psychogenic dystonia , healthy control ) between-subjects factor . The model repeat measure ANOVA include interaction three factor . If interaction muscle group significant , interaction time group evaluate muscle separately . If significance find time and/or group , evaluation follow Tukey Kramer multiple pair-wise comparison .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : For organic dystonia group : Primary focal dystonia diagnose confirmed movement disorder neurologist , confirm initial visit study investigator . For psychogenic dystonia group : Clinically establish psychogenic dystonia probable psychogenic dystonia , accord Fahn Williams criterion confirm movement disorder neurologist . For healthy volunteer group : Agematched healthy volunteer three age match pyschogenic dystonia group , three age match organic dystonia group . Adult patient ( least18 year old ) . Right hand . Ability provide consent EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Dystonia affect right APB and/or FDI , inability subject perform full rangeofmotion exercise right FDI and/or APB . Medical condition impair subject 's ability comply study protocol judge study investigator , limited seizure , brain tumor , stroke , bipolar disorder , depression , hear problem , uncontrolled systemic hypertension value 170/100 , heart disease lung disease , active respiratory disease need intervention ; pain prevent lying still 40 minute . Current prior use botulinum toxin within 3 month prior TMS intervention . Current prior use CNS drug ( include antidepressant , anxiolytic , anticonvulsant , antipsychotic , antiparkinsonian drug , hypnotic , stimulant , and/or antihistamine ) within 1 week prior TMS intervention . Active drug alcohol intake 7 alcohol drinks/week woman 14 alcoholic drinks/week men . Current pregnancy lactate woman . Menopausal status determine CNS IRB criterion . In woman childbearing potential , pregnancy test perform least 24 hour prior TMS procedure . Presence implant device pacemaker , medication pump defibrillator , metal cranium except mouth , history shrapnel injury condition/device may contraindicate Inability unwillingness subject provide write informed consent .</criteria>
