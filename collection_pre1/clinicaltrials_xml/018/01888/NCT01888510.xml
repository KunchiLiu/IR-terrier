	<brief_title>CT Diagnosing Patients With Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Conduct prospective clinical imaging study quantify amount inter- intra-physician contour variability four dimensional ( 4D ) CT , active breathing control ( ABC ) CT , free breathing CT , free breathe ABC cone beam ( CB ) CT. II . Quantify magnitude distribution target organ risk volume variation different image modality . III . Determine dosimetric change relate contour variation tumor normal tissue . OUTLINE : Patients undergo conventional free breathing CT , 4D CT , ABC CT , ABC CBCT , free breathe CBCT undergo radiation therapy .</detailed_description>
