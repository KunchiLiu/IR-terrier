	<detailed_description>The importance intratumour genetic functional heterogeneity increasingly recognise driver cancer progression survival outcome . Understanding tumour clonal heterogeneity impact upon therapeutic outcome , however , still area unmet clinical scientific need . TRACERx ( TRAcking non-small cell lung Cancer Evolution therapy [ Rx ] ) , prospective study patient primary non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , aim define evolutionary trajectory lung cancer space time multiregion longitudinal tumour sample genetic analysis . By follow cancer diagnosis relapse , track evolutionary trajectory tumours relation therapeutic intervention , determine impact clonal heterogeneity clinical outcome , TRACERx may help identify novel therapeutic target NSCLC may also serve model applicable cancer type .</detailed_description>
