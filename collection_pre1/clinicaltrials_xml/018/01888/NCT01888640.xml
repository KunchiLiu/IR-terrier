	<brief_summary>Pain associate fibromyalgia interferes daily function , work , social activity result decrease quality life . People fibromyalgia also significant amount fatigue fear movement . People fibromyalgia show enhanced excitability pain neuron central nervous system reduce pain inhibition . Therefore , one main treatment patient fibromyalgia must focus pain relief allow person function independently home work . Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation use health professional deliver electrical stimulation skin pain control . Basic science study , PI 's laboratory show TENS activate descend pain inhibitory pathway inhibit excitability pain neuron . Thus ideal patient population treatment TENS would one enhanced central excitability reduce inhibition ; fibromyalgia condition . Hypothesis : The investigator hypothesize application Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation ( TENS ) patient fibromyalgia reduce rest movement-related pain reduce central excitability restore diffuse noxious inhibitory control ( DNIC ) , decrease pain and/or central excitability reduce fatigue fear movement , thereby improve function quality life</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fibromyalgia Activity Study With Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation ( FAST )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II randomize , double-blind , placebo control multi-center clinical trial involve device , Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation ( TENS ) . TENS non-pharmacological agent delivers electrical stimulation battery operate device via electrode place skin . TENS consider safe , inexpensive non-invasive modality use treat variety acute chronic pain condition . The initial phase study randomly allocate subject receive active TENS , placebo TENS standard care ( No TENS ) . After participate 1 month random assignment , subject receive active TENS 1 month . The subject make 4 visit clinic approximately 2 3 1/2 hour visit . Visits entail questionnaire , functional task , accelerometry , TENS , pain fatigue assessment . Study Aims : Aim # 1 : The primary aim study test effect long-term use TENS movement-related pain measure numeric rating scale ( NRS ) six minute walk test ( 6MWT ) woman fibromyalgia random assignment three treatment : standard care ( No TENS ) , placebo TENS active TENS . Aim # 2 : A secondary aim test movement-pain reduction TENS result concomitant decrease fear movement , fatigue , rest pain analgesic medication increase function quality life . Outcome measure include physical function directly assess daily activity accelerometer , self-report ( IPAQ ) , well perform specific function task . A sub-analysis determine responder non-responders TENS factor predict responder non-responders . Multiple factor could contribute TENS response include self-efficacy , pain catastrophizing , level physical activity , fear movement , sleep , pain , fatigue , function , quality life , pain physiology . Aim # 3 : To determine active TENS alters pain process woman fibromyalgia improvement clinical symptom correlate normalization pain processing physiology . We evaluate change physiologic parameter responder versus non-responders assess clinically.Pain processing assess examining pressure pain threshold site outside site stimulation examine condition pain modulation Aim # 4 : To determine PROMIS ( patient report outcome measurement information system ) useful instrument assess outcome woman fibromyalgia compare PROMIS module symptom domain measure instrument validate use fibromyalgia clinical trial determine performance PROMIS definition responder .</detailed_description>
