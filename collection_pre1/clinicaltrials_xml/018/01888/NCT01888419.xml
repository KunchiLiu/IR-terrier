	<detailed_description>Background In Denmark , breast cancer common fatal cancer woman 4700 new case annually . All patient treat accord national guideline develop Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group ( DBCG ) . Treatment primarily consist surgical removal part breast simultaneous removal one-or lymph node ipsilateral axilla . Subsequently , may need additional treatment chemotherapy , radiation / anti-hormonal therapy , order reduce risk recurrence . Up 60 % woman treat surgically breast cancer , experience chronic pain consequence treatment . This condition previously refer `` Post Mastectomy Pain Syndrome '' , condition also see less extensive form breast cancer surgery , condition term `` Post Therapy Breast Pain Syndrome '' ( PBTPS ) . PBTPS define neuropathic pain condition pain localize axilla , medial part upper arm , chest chest wall side surgery , last three month surgery / end treatment . In 2011 Caviggioli et al . publish study lipotransplantation mastectomy area find significant analgesic effect . The aforementioned study date publish study field . However , randomize study . In order obtain evidence apparent beneficial effect lipotransplantation pain , present study initiate . Lipotransplantation fast relatively non-invasive technique describe detail Coleman et al.. Additionally , study 2008 , Klinger et al . find lipotransplantation burn scar face result significant improvement patient 's skin scar quality also reduce pain treated area . The theoretical basis scar skin modify effect lipotransplantation yet finally understood . To best knowledge , study systematically investigate analysed effect lipotransplantation irradiate mastectomy area histological level . The purpose study The purpose study investigate whether lipotransplantation pain affect mastectomy area , could analgesic effect woman affect Post Breast Therapy Pain Syndrome . Secondary , wish investigate scar skin modulate effect lipotransplantation area . By carry immunohistochemical stain subsequent stereoscopic microscopy free nerve ending skin biopsy take lipotransplantationen wish determine whether change number type free nerve ending part mechanism pain reduction . Hypotheses - Lipotransplantation area scar tissue area pain-afflicted area reduces pain woman PBTPS . - The neuropathic pain PBTPS correlate number free nerve ending cross border dermis epidermis - Lipotransplantation beneficial effect scar tissue structure improve skin quality . Patients Women undergone unilateral mastectomy breast cancer Aarhus University Hospital , Aarhus , Denmark , applicable , finish adjuvant postoperative radiation therapy least 6 month ago . Patients must pain localized area miss breast least three month adjuvant radiation therapy end . A total 32 patient PBTPS include . Methods Patients PBTPS randomly assign receive either lipotransplantation active treatment . Regardless randomization , patient invite three follow-up visit , respectively 3 6 month inclusion/surgery . At outpatient visit participant ask complete DoloTest ® , VAS pain score Patient Scar Assessment Scale . The clinician complete Observer Scar Assessment Scale record consumption pain medication . DoloTest ® validate , visual analogue questionnaire design ass patient experienced pain impact patient daily life . Three 3-mm punch biopsy take inclusion , one mastectomy scar , one skin 2 cm mastectomy scar medioclavicular line , one healthy skin health breast area correspond skin biopsy . The skin punch biopsy pain afflicted area fix 4 % phosphate buffer paraformaldehyde . After freeze , tissue sample cut 50-micron thick section . Systematically sampled section immunostained rabbit anti-human Protein Gene Product 9.5 ( neuron-specific protein ) , DAB-marked goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody . The section microscoped Olympus BX51 light microscope Olympus DP71 digital camera Prior motorized board connect computer Newcast stereology software . Two goal calculate : 1 ) number free nerve ending , cross border dermis epidermis per mm 2 ) average nerve fibre length density epidermis / dermis . The skin punch biopsy mastectomy scar fix formaldehyde embed paraffin . The tissue sample cut 1-2 micron thick section stain Picrosirius red ( PR ) colour . By use polarized light microscopy , various subtypes collagen fibre may visualize differentiate . The thicker collagen fibre ( type I ) red-orange-yellow thinner collagen fibre ( type III ) green . Furthermore , section stain elastin . Quantitatively , mean above-mentioned method , change volume fraction collagen type I III , elastin may measure . Statistical analyze The minimal clinically relevant difference study look , Visual Analog Pain score difference 3 . The common standard deviation estimate similar study Caviggioli et al . 2011 , set 2.96 Visual Analog Pain scale . We assume standard deviation ( SD ) . Using follow formula : N = ( Za + Zb ) 2 x SD2 / dif2 Za Zb standardize normal deviation correspond select level significance , SD Standard Deviation dif minimal clinically relevant difference study look . The result 16 patient arm , total 32 patient , significance level set 5 % power study set 80 % . Statistical analyzes perform collaboration biostatistician Health Sciences Institution , Aarhus University , Denmark . Economic Conditions The project support : Faculty Health Sciences , University Aarhus three full time equivalent , use pay full-time academic staff . Other project expense cover independent foundation endowment influence study . None personnel project financial interest project . Compensation participate patient The participate patient study receive financial compensation . However , document travel expense reimburse . Recruitment participant Patients primarily recruit previous study , questionnaire sent woman receive unilateral mastectomy Aarhus University Hospital , period 2009 2013 . In questionnaire , patient ask evaluate pain different area pertain PBTPS , would allow department contact regard present study . If patient fulfil inclusion criterion , contact primary investigator telephone , meeting detail study present arrange . Patients PBTPS could also recruit routine visit department oncology . The patient always offer least 24 hour consideration decide give write consent participate study . With sign consent form , patient accepts term condition study . The patient may time without justification withdraw consent participate , without decision affect present future treatment right patient may . Publication result Negative , inconclusive positive result study publish internationally recognize , peer-reviewed , English-language journal interest field . Ethical statement , side effect risk In present project , data treat confidentially accordance Danish Act Processing Personal Data . Participants shall inform write orally prior decide participate study . The participant thus fully aware project purpose , background method , well expect patient 's role participant . The participate patient lipotransplantation group , offer active treatment , current study program confirm foreign study , hopefully reduce daily pain discomfort thereby also consumption analgesia . If project provide positive result , control group , study end , offer active treatment . The patient , informed consent , part project , connection : 1 . Lipotransplantation general anaesthesia ; expose risk associate general anaesthesia . The patient present study relation previous surgery breast cancer expose one intervention general anaesthesia . 2 . Risks related actual lipotransplantation . At donor site , risk short-term tenderness temporary discolouration . In long term , slightly rough surface skin may arise . The advantage harvest fat graft patient achieve visible improvement contour donor site . 3 . The risk relate skin punch biopsy : apart small scar 1-3 mm correspond place biopsy collect , assess risk permanent injury damage . All intervention carry experienced specialist plastic surgery several year experience lipotransplantation . The general anaesthesia perform specialist anaesthesiology , part permanent team plastic surgery department therefore familiar provide anaesthesia describe procedure .</detailed_description>
