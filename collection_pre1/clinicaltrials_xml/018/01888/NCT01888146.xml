	<detailed_description>Pain common costly public health problem . Common chronic pain condition expensive pervasive , affect least 116 million American adult annual cost $ 560 billion direct medical treatment cost lose productivity , disproportionally affect vulnerable population . Pain primary reason patient seek medical care , first point contact , primary care provider ( PCPs ) deliver majority care . Unfortunately , PCPs face many challenge manage patient ' care often little specific train pain medicine . Yet proper system support , PCPs best position coordinate pain management longitudinally . While pharmacotherapy predominant treatment approach many PCPs , limit patient 's role take medication , become passive recipient care—leading poor outcome , potential overmedication , possible disillusionment medical system . Further , increase opiate prescribe pain treatment —amidst increase awareness adverse outcome , include addiction—and limit efficacy suggest importance broader treatment approach focus patient ' improvement functioning . Although opiate may reduce pain symptom prescribe , patient unlikely experience significant sustain improvement without use nonpharmacologic pain management approach . Medical management patient persistent pain complex problem often fragment , lead patient seek wide variety primary specialty care service effort manage pain related condition . Such fragmented care lead poor outcome significantly increase health care cost patient often receive unneeded diagnostic medical procedure . While research identify evidence-based multidisciplinary behavioral treatment approach effective patient even prevent disability associate persistent pain offer early course care , intervention rarely available everyday practice setting require data pragmatic clinical trial change care paradigm . To address issue , propose mixed-methods , cluster-randomized pragmatic clinical trial evaluate integration psychosocial service within primary care environment . This project implement intervention everyday clinical practice flow utilize assessment measure intervention staff directly clinical care system rather utilizing research-developed administered structure . The intervention integrate program guide care intervention patient . We compare primary care-based intervention usual care use systematic , clinic-based assessment . During initial phase , pilot intervention 50 patient Kaiser Permanente Northwest ( KPNW ) region patient select primary care provider non-malignant chronic pain ( pain persist ≥ 3 month ) long-term opiate therapy treatment condition . This pilot portion project preparation effective implementation large-scale , cluster-randomized pragmatic clinical trial conduct throughout three region Kaiser Permanente - Northwest , Georgia , Hawaii compare primary care base multidisciplinary intervention usual care setting . This intervention bring together element often available health plan organize less integrated fashion , ensure flexibility implementation best fit individual clinic environment need chronic pain patient long-term opiate therapy .</detailed_description>
