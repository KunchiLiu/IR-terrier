	<criteria>Patients must recurrent persistent endometrial carcinoma refractory curative therapy establish treatment . Histologic confirmation original primary tumor require . Patients follow histologic epithelial cell type eligible : endometrioid adenocarcinoma . All patient must measurable disease . Measurable disease define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long dimension record ) . Each lesion must ≥ 20 mm measure conventional technique , include palpation , plain xray , CT , MRI , ≥ 10 mm measure spiral CT . Patients must least one `` target lesion '' use assess response protocol define RECIST 1.1 ( Section 11.1 ) . Tumors within previously irradiate field designate `` nontarget '' lesion unless progression document biopsy obtain confirm persistence least 90 day follow completion radiation therapy . Patients must document FGFR2 activate mutation either primary , recurrent metastatic biopsy . Over 90 % FGFR2 mutation occur 7 codon . Activating mutation define know FGFR2 hotspot S252W , P253R , S373C , Y376C , C383R , N550K , N550H , K660E . Patients receive one two prior regimen must GOG Performance Status 0 , 1 , 2 .

Any hormonal therapy direct malignant tumor must discontinue least one week prior registration . Any prior therapy direct malignant tumor , include immunologic agent , must discontinue least three week prior registration . Patients must least one prior chemotherapeutic regimen management endometrial carcinoma . Chemotherapy administer conjunction primary radiation radiosensitizer count systemic chemotherapy regimen . Patients may receive prior antiangiogenic compound ( i.e. , bevacizumab ) . Patients allow receive , required receive , two additional cytotoxic regimens management recurrent persistent endometrial disease accord follow definition : Cytotoxic regimen include agent target genetic and/or mitotic apparatus divide cell , result doselimiting toxicity bone marrow and/or gastrointestinal mucosa . Patients must adequate bone marrow function define : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,500/mcl Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcl Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dl Patients must adequate renal function define : • Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) Proteinuria must ≤ 3+ dipstick baseline . If urine dipstick &gt; 3+ , 24hour protein level must perform . The 24hour protein level must ≤ 3.5 g/24 hour . Patients must adequate hepatic function define : Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN AST ( SGOT ) , ALT ( SGPT ) , alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN Albumin ≥ 2.5 g/dl Patients must adequate neurologic function define : • Neuropathy ( sensory motor ) ≤ grade 1 Patients must adequate blood coagulation parameter define : PT international normalize ratio ( INR ) ≤ 1.5 Patients therapeutic warfarin exclude trial ; anticoagulation heparin heparinlike compound permit provided patient 's PT INR ≤ 1.5 . Patients must able understand willing sign approve informed consent authorization permit release personal health information . Patients childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test perform 48 hour prior first dose practice effective form contraception study least 3 month receive final treatment ponatinib . Effective contraception define hormonal barrier method , abstinence . Patients must baseline electrocardiogram complete prior study entry QTc ≤ 450 msec . Baseline ECG repeat QTc find &gt; 450 msec . QTc must NOT &gt; 450 msec ECGs perform visit . Patients must prior therapy ponatinib antiFGFR ( fibroblast growth factor receptor ) therapy include brivanib , BIBF1120 , E7080 . Patients history invasive malignancy , exception nonmelanoma skin cancer , localize cancer breast , localize cancer head neck , exclude evidence malignancy present within last five year . Patients also exclude previous cancer treatment contraindicate protocol therapy . Patients receive prior radiotherapy portion abdominal cavity pelvis OTHER THAN treatment endometrial cancer within last five year exclude . Prior radiation localize cancer breast , head neck , skin permit , provide complete three year prior registration , patient remain free recurrent metastatic disease . Patients receive prior chemotherapy abdominal pelvic tumor OTHER THAN treatment endometrial cancer within last five year exclude . Patients may receive prior adjuvant chemotherapy localize breast cancer , provide complete three year prior registration , patient remain free recurrent metastatic disease . Patients must require chronic antiplatelet therapy ( aspirin &gt; 300 mg/day , clopidogrel great equal 75mg/day ) . Patients must gastrointestinal bleed hemorrhage/bleeding event ≥ grade 3 within 30 day prior study entry . Patients must history poor wound healing , nonhealing ulcer bone fracture within last 3 month . Patients must uncontrolled significant cardiovascular disease include : Myocardial infarction within 3 month Uncontrolled angina within 3 month Class IIIIV New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) congestive heart failure ( see Appendix B ) Uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic BP &gt; 150 diastolic BP &gt; 100 mmHg 24 hour ) despite optimize antihypertensive therapy . BP must 150/100 mmHg screening . Subjects history hypertension receive treatment calcium channel blocker CYP3A4 inhibitor change alternative antihypertensive medication study entry History stroke , TIA , CNS ischemic event Cardiac arrhythmia require antiarrhythmic therapy beta blocker digoxin Pretherapy Left Ventricle Ejection Fraction ( LVEF ) ≤ 50 % Valvular heart disease ≥ grade 2 Patients must serious uncontrolled medical disorder active infection would impair ability subject receive protocol therapy whose control may jeopardize complication therapy .

Patients must active/known HIV , Hepatitis B , Hepatitis C. Patients must know brain metastasis . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurological dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Patients must history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biological composition ponatinib agent use study . Patients must pregnant nursing . Patients must untreated malabsorption syndrome . Patients must baseline serum potassium &lt; 3.5 mmol/L ( potassium supplementation may give restore serum potassium level prior study entry ) . Patients therapeutic warfarin anticoagulation exclude . Patients convert anticoagulation heparin compound allow provided PT INR ≤ 1.5 . Patients : 1 . History acute pancreatitis within 1 year study history chronic pancreatitis 2 . History alcohol abuse 3 . History uncontrolled hypertriglyceridemia ( triglyceride &gt; 450 mg/dL ) Women Minorities Participating institution exclude potential subject participate study solely basis ethnic origin socioeconomic status . Every attempt make enter eligible patient protocol therefore address study objectives patient population representative entire endometrial cancer population treat participate institution .</criteria>
