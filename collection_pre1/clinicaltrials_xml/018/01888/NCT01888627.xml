	<detailed_description>The trial carry Psychosis Center Department Psychiatry Psychotherapy University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf ( UKE ) , responsibility treat adult psychosis patient within catchment area approximately 300.000 habitant . The IC model implement network Psychosis Center University hospital ( UKE ) , private psychiatrist UKE catchment area outpatient facility . As , follow health care structure part model could use patient relatives accord need : - Specialized inpatient unit attach day-clinic psychotic disorder ; - Acute inpatient unit Department ; - Specialized psychosis outpatient center separate schizophrenia-spectrum bipolar outpatient team variety diagnosis-specific evidence-based individual- group therapy , low-threshold offer promote day structure ( e.g. , cooking , sport art group ) , early detection intervention service mobile early detection team professional child- youth adult psychiatry , possibility peer-to-peer relatives-to-relatives counseling , relative group , etc . ; - A multidisciplinary assertive community treatment ( ACT ) team , basically implement accord guideline Assertive Community Treatment Association accord Dartmouth Assertive Community Treatment Scale ( DACTS ) .

Members ACT team receive diagnosis-specific training pharmacotherapy , cognitive behavioral ( CBT ) , dynamic , and/or family psychotherapy . - A specialized day-clinic first-episode psychosis patient age range 15-29 year manage child- youth adult psychiatry ; - A working support outpatient center outpatient day-clinic treatment facility ; - 20 private psychiatrist participate treatment network IC model ( duty responsibility describe ) . - Further participant network : psychiatric nursing service , specialize housing support service specialize psychosis living unit . Within network , main responsibility individual patient relative generally allocate accord need preference two specific member ACT team , one psychiatrist responsible pharmacotherapy . However , pharmacotherapy stable adherence assure , private psychiatrist allow take responsibility . In case , specific IC contract private psychiatrist include several quality assurance guideline . Briefly , staff/client caseload ratio single full time employ ACT team member 1:15-25 . In case , first responsibility network broad assessment psychotic disorder , comorbid psychiatric somatic disorder , traumatic event , previous service engagement medication adherence , social problem , etc . Thereby , need-adapted treatment plan develop together patient , relatives caregiver . If patient start IC inpatient , transition in- outpatient care organize . Participant , relatives caregiver receive two telephone number : one ACT therapists contact within office hour ( Monday Friday 8 6 pm ) 24 hour crisis number emergency question outside office hour .

Further , low-threshold intervention outpatient center could use time . Thereby day-clinic equivalent program could organize outpatient status . As many patient risk service disengagement medication non-adherence , strict 'no-drop-out ' policy implement include admission catchment area . Managed Care Briefly , UKE manage care organization IC model full financial responsibility . The UKE receive yearly per-patient rate , calculate accord real direct health care cost individual patient include inpatient- , day-clinic- outpatient treatment . More 20 % rate cause 'hospital hopping ' repeat emergency room visit . Within one year calculate yearly per-patient rate include : ( 1 ) inpatient day , ( 2 ) day-clinic , ( 3 ) intervention ACT team , ( 4 ) intervention Specialized psychosis outpatient center , ( 5 ) intervention private psychiatrist ( receive 4-times high finance per-patient per-year overall yearly per-patient rate ) , ( 6 ) psychotherapeutic intervention , ( 7 ) assessment insure quality outcome , ( 8 ) manage care facility . There two specific arrangement : ( 1 ) IC model start financially first day admission hospital . This arrangement support quick enter new IC model reduce financial risk health insurance . ( 2 ) One specific guideline within model stop hospital hopping . To foster guideline , UKE pay yearly per-patient rate every admission hospital outside network 4th day . Assessments measure Assessments carry baseline , 6 week , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 , 42 , 48 month follow-ups . At baseline , follow variable assess : 1 ) Diagnosis psychotic disorder co-morbid AXIS I disorder ( ) Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV Axis I disorder ( SCID-I ) . In case clinical evidence co-morbid AXIS II disorder , SCID-II interview DSM-IV Personality Disorder applied40 ; 2 ) demographic illness characteristic assessed German version Early Psychosis File Questionnaire ( EPFQ ) include age , gender , marital status , year school education , complete professional education , employment/occupation entry , ability independent living , traumatic event , family history psychiatric illness , previous suicide attempt , previous hospital admission include involuntary admission , insight illness forensic history .

The CSQ-8 8-item instrument score 1 4 . The total score range 8 32 ; mean satisfaction score compute minimum score 1 maximum 4 . Service disengagement present , patient repeatedly refuse treatment despite need several attempt reengagement ( phone call patient potentially home visit ACT team ) . Service use data assess official IC database , cover inpatient admission , day-clinic admission , treatment contact ACT team , psychosis outpatient center private psychiatrist .</detailed_description>
