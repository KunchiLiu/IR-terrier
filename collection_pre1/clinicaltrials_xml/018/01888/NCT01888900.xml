	<brief_summary>Background : - Some people chronic hepatitis C respond usual treatment peginterferon ribavirin . New chronic hepatitis treatment develop may work well different people . The treatment look specific gene interact drug . Researchers want see well new drug work people whose chronic hepatitis C respond partly respond usual treatment drug . Objectives : - To compare new treatment people chronic hepatitis C. Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age chronic hepatitis C respond standard treatment . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . Liver scan biopsy take start treatment . - Participants separate two group . One group new treatment drug ( assunaprevir daclatasvir ) . The second group two drug well peginterferon ribavirin . All participant initial 4-day hospital stay regular blood test see start treatment work . - The first group take new study drug tablet daily 24 week . Those respond treatment also start take peginterferon ribavirin , treatment continue 24 week start additional drug . - The second group take four drug accord standard dosing schedule 24 week . - Treatment monitor frequent blood test . Liver scan , biopsy , test perform direct study doctor . - Participants 24 week regular followup visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>New Treatment Response People With Without Cirrhosis From Chronic Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up 70 patient chronic hepatitis C , genotype 1 , partial null responder optimal therapy combination peginterferon ribavirin enrol pilot study use asunaprevir daclatasvir together combination peginterferon alfa-2a ribavirin improve response antiviral therapy . Two separate study conduct base upon HCV genotype 1 subtype . For patient HCV genotype 1b : Will undergo baseline test NS5A RAVs know confer resistance daclatasvir ( L31/Y93 ) . Subjects harbor NS5A resistance associate variant exclude receive dual therapy would offer quad therapy manage HCV genotype 1a subject . After medical evaluation liver biopsy , 30 HCV genotype 1b patient receive combination therapy asunaprevir daclatasvir alone 24 week undergo pair liver biopsy , pre-treatment either 2 4 week start therapy . Patients HCV RNA great equal LLOQ 8 week either discontinue therapy point ( early stopping rule futility ) may rescue therapy instituted discretion investigator QUAD regimen ( asunaprevir daclatasvir plus peginterferon ribavirin ) provide meet pre-specified inclusion criterion . For patient HCV genotype 1a : After medical evaluation liver biopsy 40 ( 15 cirrhosis 15 Ishak fibrosis 0-2 ; remain 10 slot allocate individual meet histological entry requirement i.e . Ishak 3-4 ) HCV genotype 1a patient start combination therapy asunaprevir , daclatasvir , peginterferon alfa-2a ribavirin 24 week . Patients randomize undergo second liver biopsy study week 4 start therapy either 6 hour next schedule peginterferon dose assess intrahepatic interferon stimulate gene expression . Intrahepatic drug concentration asunaprevir daclatasvir measure part ancillary study . Patients HCV RNA great euqal LLOQ 8 week discontinue therapy ( early stopping rule futility ) . Routine serum chemistry , complete blood count HCV RNA level monitor frequently initial 4 day standard interval period antiviral therapy . The major endpoint change interferon stimulate gene protein expression liver change HCV RNA level liver serum baseline 4 week . Secondary endpoint rate sustain virologic response 12 24 week therapy .</detailed_description>
