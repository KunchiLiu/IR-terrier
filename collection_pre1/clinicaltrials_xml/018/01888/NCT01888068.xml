	<brief_summary>A new investigational device ( BIA/Vitality Analyzer™ ) compare United States Food Drug Approved 'predicate ' reference device ( EFG® ) demonstrate provide equivalent measurement body fat . Both device `` over-the-counter '' bioimpedance body composition analyzer ( estimate body fat ) . These device classify 'Not Significant Risk ' device ; expose significant risk .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>You ask 'healthy ' help sub-investigator decide study . This part `` screening '' process . If 'healthy , ' ask read sign inform consent document enter study . The study Sub-investigator ask age , stand height body weight . This information use describe study participant . You lie flat surface/table ; remove shoe , sock jewelry . Four adhesive electrode attach right hand foot ( two hand foot ) , small clip connect electrode . A low level , radiofrequency alternate electrical current ( 425 microamps 50 kilohertz ) introduce one pair ( hand foot ) voltage across body measure ( hand foot ) . You feel current introduce body . While remain table , test repeat second bioimpedance device . The time required complete test fifteen minute . Participation study depend upon healthy meet specific study guideline . Screening study include : 1 . You age 18 99 year old 2 . You declare healthy know disease condition 3 . You pregnant 4 . You implanted electrical defibrillator 5 . You pacemaker The method determine body impedance base conduction apply electrical current organism . In biological structure , application constant low-level alternate current result impedance spread current frequency dependent . The living organism contain intra- extracellular fluid behave electrical conductor cell membrane act electrical condenser regard imperfect reactive element . At low frequency ( -1 kHz ) current mainly pass extracellular fluid , whereas high frequency ( 50-800 kHz ) , penetrate intra- extracellular fluid . Thus body fluid electrolytes responsible electrical conductance , inverse resistance , cell membrane involve capacitance . In biological system , electrical conduction related water ionic distribution conductor . Because fat-free mass , include protein matrix adipose tissue , contain virtually water conduct electrolyte body , conductivity far great fat-free mass fat mass body . This hypothetical relationship propose Nyboer et al. , demonstrate electrically determine biological volume ( V ) inversely relate resistance ( R ) , reactance ( Xc ) . Because magnitude reactance small relative resistance , resistance well predictor impedance reactance , expression V become : V = pL2/R , R ohm .</detailed_description>
