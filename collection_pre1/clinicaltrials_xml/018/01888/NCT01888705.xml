	<brief_summary>Recently , grow interest study nonlinear dynamic methodology complementary analysis characterize respiratory pattern . These method well establish study heart rate . The analyzes evaluate complex signal , include large-scale fractal correlation distribution time series , provide relevant clinical information . Measures approximate entropy sample entropy show great potential evaluation complexity respiratory system , provide information relevant understanding physiological pathophysiological process . These measure base concept non-linearity presence high number interconnection , result complex behavior exhibit physiological system . The approximate entropy ( ApEn ) relate amount clutter , complexity unpredictability data series time . In complementary way , sample entropy ( SampEn ) , far elaborate ApEn , reduce possible bias estimate due self-similarity . A study conduct group asthma patient different level bronchial obstruction demonstrate significant reduction airflow approximate entropy ( ApEnV´ ) asthmatic subject . Investigators believe COPD , similar occurs asthma disorder associate complex change pathophysiology trigger breath control , possibly result change air flow ( V´ ) . Considering development `` silent '' change mechanical ventilation COPD patient clinical relevance , well difficulty identify change conventional method , observe need obtain detailed information , include complexity system breathe well understanding factor contribute illness . In context , objective study : ( 1 ) analyze influence airway obstruction complexity pattern airflow patient COPD , ( 2 ) evaluate diagnostic power test identifying change cause COPD .</brief_summary>
