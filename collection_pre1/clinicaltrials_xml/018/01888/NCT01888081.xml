	<brief_title>A-dmDT390-bisFv ( UCHT1 ) Fusion Protein Combination With Ionizing Radiation Treatment Stage IV Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A-dmDT390-bisFv ( UCHT1 ) ( Resimmuneâ„¢ ) , anti-T cell immunotoxin currently study treatment cutaneous T cell lymphoma CD3+ malignant disease ( FDA IND Number : 100712 , Scott White Protocol 071163 ) . During course study , data accumulate Resimmune could act immunomodulator . This base observation four six partial response convert complete response time range 6 24 month follow completion 4-day treatment protocol treatment take place . The purpose trial test hypothesis Resimmune act immunomodulator late stage metastatic melanoma combine palliative radiation induce prim activate T cell tumor antigen . The primary objective study determine safety combine Resimmune palliative radiation therapy patient stage IV melanoma . A secondary objective document tumor response duration response irradiate unirradiated site ( abscopal effect ) . An additional secondary objective determine T cell activation occur follow administration A-dmDT390-bisFv ( UCHT1 ) local radiation metastatic lesion melanoma .</detailed_description>
