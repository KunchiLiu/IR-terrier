	<brief_title>Phase 0/1 Biomarker Pharmacodynamic Study Roflumilast Patients With Advanced B-Cell Hematologic Malignancies ( CTRC # 13-0013 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study evaluate whether administration roflumilast inhibits activity PDE4 result modulation AKT/mTOR pathways patient B-cell hematologic malignancy . Peripheral blood sample collect purpose determine pharmacodynamics roflumilast PDE4 activity biomarkers relate GC resistance . Samples obtain baseline prior start study treatment , Day 8 administration Day 8 study drug ( prednisone roflumilast ) , Day 15 . If bone marrow biopsy also perform prior study treatment time treatment , sample send analysis . Normal PBMC ( bone marrow obtain ) examine change key target relate inhibition PDE4 potential reversal glucocorticoid resistance . Biomarker blood sample analyze order characterize pharmacodynamics roflumilast alone combination prednisone PDE4 activity biomarkers , phospho-AKT , phosphorylation level mTOR target .</detailed_description>

Patients must fail , refuse , ineligible , otherwise appropriate potential standard curative treatment . In addition , patient must refractory intolerant establish therapy know provide clinical benefit condition . The original diagnostic biopsy and/or diagnostic data ( e.g. , cell marker data ) suffice . Has fail ≥ 1 previous treatment malignancy , relapse refractory disease follow recent prior treatment . ECOG performance status ≤ 2 life expectancy least 3 month . Ability swallow oral tablet without difficulty . All subject preserve reproductive potential must agree practice abstinence employ contraceptive measure duration treatment 4 week follow final dosing . All male subject consider reproductive potential . Female subject reproductive potential : 1 ) least 50 year old menses 24 consecutive month ; 2 ) render surgically sterile ( undergone hysterectomy and/or bilateral salpingooophorectomy ) . Female subject reproductive potential must negative serum pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit human chorionic gonadotropin ( [ hCG ] ) within 7 day first day drug dosing . Has recover adverse , toxic effect prior therapy ≤ Grade 1 ( NCICTCAE v4 ) except alopecia peripheral neuropathy . This requirement subordinate specific clinical laboratory criterion otherwise specifically addressed inclusion/exclusion criterion . Peripheral neuropathy must recover ≤ Grade 2 except patient WM , may enroll Grade 3 peripheral neuropathy due underlie WM . Meet follow clinical laboratory requirement : All patient , except ALL : Creatinine clearance CockcroftGault formula ≥30 ml/min Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN ( unless indirect bilirubin elevate due Gilbert 's syndrome hemolysis ) Aspartate aminotransaminase ( AST ) alanine aminotransaminase ( ALT ) ≤ 3 × ULN Platelet count ≥ 50,000/uL , patient may transfuse value . Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1000/uL , without chronic granulocyte growth factor support Hemoglobin ≥8 g/dL , patient may transfuse value For patient ALL CLL : The hematological criterion apply . Prior allogeneic bone marrow transplant within 6 month screen date . Prior autologous stem cell transplant within 3 month screen date . Active central nervous system ( CNS ) involvement lymphoma , include untreated symptomatic epidural disease . Patients autoimmune hemolytic anemia immune thrombocytopenia require ongoing active immunotherapy study entry systemic corticosteroid less equal prednisone equivalent 20 mg/day . Allergy intolerance roflumilast . Immunotherapy , chemotherapy , radiotherapy investigational therapy within 3 week ( within 4 week monoclonal antibody ; within 6 week nitrosoureas ; within 12 week iodine131 tositumomab ibritumomab tiuxetan ) prior study drug dosing . Active uncontrolled infection . Is receive concurrent high dos systemic corticosteroid . High dose consider &gt; 20 mg dexamethasone day ( equivalent ) &gt; 7 consecutive day . Uncontrolled illness include limited : symptomatic congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] Class III IV heart failure ) , unstable angina pectoris , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness would limit compliance study requirement .
