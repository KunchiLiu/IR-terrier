	<brief_summary>Background : - Some study adults found insulin glucose blood level low long period sit broken walking , compare sit without break . This mean body well process sugar walk break day . Researchers want know also true child . Some study find child attention memory might better exercise . Researchers want know short walk breaks effect . Objectives : - To understand break sit walk helps child body well use sugars improves child concentration . Eligibility : - Healthy child age 7 11 . Design : - Participants screen physical exam , medical history , exercise test , picture vocabulary test , medical test include blood test X-rays . - Participants return two 7-hour visit . In month visit , wear physical activity monitor one week researcher know active . Once take sit test sit breaks test . - During sit test , participant sit 3 hour . - During sit breaks test , sit 3 hour 3-minute walk break every 30 minute . - Both day , drink sugar water . Then participant blood drawn needle keep place , wear heart monitor . They take attention work memory test computer answer question feel . They eat meal end test day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Interrupting Sedentary Behavior Metabolic Cognitive Outcomes Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prevention pediatric obesity complication U.S. public health priority . Promoting physical activity propose intervention strategy . Apart reduce excessive weight , physical activity improve cardiovascular fitness , insulin sensitivity , academic performance . However , emerge evidence adult suggest increase physical activity may entirely counteract negative health effect sedentary lifestyle . Sedentary behavior define set low-intensity activity involve limited body movement ( e.g . : TV viewing , prolong sit ) . TV view associate lower cognitive function depressive symptom . Some study find high level childhood sedentary behavior predict high body mass index ( BMI ) cholesterol adulthood , suggest negative health consequence may begin early . Dunstan et al . conduct first lab-based study adult investigate interrupt prolonged sedentary behavior physical activity break . The author find overweight adult , add 2-minute moderate-intensity walking break every 20 minute reduce postprandial insulin glucose response 23.0 % 29.6 % , respectively . Thus , interrupt sedentary behavior may intervention strategy reduce health risk . In child , cross-sectional observational study indicate sedentary behavior pattern characterize short bout activity associate increase cardiometabolic risk . However date , in-lab study manipulate sedentary behavior child . Therefore , propose conduct randomize crossover pilot feasibility study ass whether interrupt sedentary behavior influence metabolic executive function , attention , mood , anxiety , dietary intake . Children , age 7-11 year , complete two condition random order : 3 hour prolong sit 3 hour sit interrupt 3 minute moderate-intensity walk every 30 minute . The specific aim project investigate whether interrupt sedentary behavior improve metabolic parameter change executive function , attention , mood , anxiety , dietary intake . The primary hypothesis postprandial insulin incremental area curve ( iAUC ) low interrupt sit vs. prolong sit condition . The exploratory secondary hypothesis glucose iAUC , executive function , attention , mood , anxiety , dietary intake differ two condition . This project investigate interrupt sedentary time affect potential negative health consequence sedentary behavior child . If interrupt sedentary time short bout beneficial effect among child , intervention examine frequency , duration , intensity interruption could develop . Thus , result potential provide insight novel behavioral intervention target youth .</detailed_description>
