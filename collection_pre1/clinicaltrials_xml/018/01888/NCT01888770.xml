	<brief_title>The Effect Prematurity Hypertensive Disorders Pregnancy Offspring Cardiovascular Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While incidence cardiovascular disease reduce dramatically , coincide favourable change risk factor , cardiovascular disease remain single large cause mortality premature mortality United Kingdom . Identification novel biological pathway underlie disease susceptibility raise potential new early primary prevention strategy complement classical management . There particular interest role early environment 'programming ' risk cardiovascular disease later life grow evidence various early life exposure impact cardiovascular health long term . The investigator therefore design EPOCH study investigate whether individual bear hypertensive pregnancy and/or preterm birth demonstrate difference cardiovascular phenotype birth , whether develop difference first three month life whether varies perinatal factor . This study also allow investigation short term impact perinatal intervention use cohort . Comprehensive multi-modality non-invasive imaging measure cardiovascular structure function allow precise quantification cardiovascular phenotype population .</detailed_description>
