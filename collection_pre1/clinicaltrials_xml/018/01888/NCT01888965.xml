	<detailed_description>This single institution , nonrandomized , open-label pilot study dovitinib maintenance adjuvant therapy patient colorectal pancreas cancer . Patient Populations : Cohort 1 : Stage 4 Colon Cancer s/p metastasectomy ( Adjuvant cohort ) Cohort 2 : Stage 4 Colon Cancer initial chemotherapy ( Maintenance cohort ) Cohort 3 : Pancreas Cancer s/p resection adjuvant chemo ( Adjuvant cohort ) Cohort 4 : Locally advance pancreas cancer s/p chemo radiation ( Maintenance cohort ) Each 4 cohort accrue independently . 15 patient accrue cohort . Treatment begin follow completion standard adjuvant induction therapy . Patients continue take dovitinib demonstrate progression disease use standard RECIST criterion , withdraw consent , experience unacceptable toxicity . Blood urine Biomarker study perform patient cohort . Samples collect baseline every 8 week first 6 month every 3 month thereafter , patient study . Blood urine collect banked protein , miRNA metabolomic analysis . Tumor specimens take patient maintenance cohorts 2 week initiation dovitinib . All sample analyze determine biomarkers benefit progression determine .</detailed_description>
