	<brief_summary>This study design evaluate effect GSK2339345 relative placebo number cough patient Chronic Idiopathic Cough ( CIC ) administer Aqueous Droplet Inhaler ( ADI ) . The primary aim investigate efficacy GSK2339345 reduce objective cough frequency CIC patient . The secondary aim study investigate efficacy GSK2339345 inhibit hypertussive cough response elicit capsaicin citric acid CIC patient hyperresponsive cough reflex . Following screen visit , eligible subject attend unit dose Visits 1-7 . At Visits 1 , 2 3 ( Part A study ) , subject receive two dos either GSK2339345 placebo , 4 hour apart undergo 8 hour cough monitoring . At Visits 4 5 ( Part B study ) Visits 6 7 ( Part C study ) , subject administer single dose either GSK2339345 placebo . Subjects undergo capsaicin ( Part B ) citric acid ( Part C ) tussive challenge undergo cough monitoring 1 hour post dose . The maximum study duration approximately 11 week , include 3 week screen 2 week follow-up . Approximately 30 patient randomise study , approximately 24 patient complete dose critical assessment .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Chronic Idiopathic Cough patient accord criterion list , determine responsible experienced physician , base medical evaluation : Idiopathic cough define chronic cough resistant treatment target potential trigger . Chronic cough define cough lasting 8 week . A patient clinical abnormality laboratory parameter outside reference range population study may include Investigator GSK Medical Monitor agree find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . Male/females age &gt; =18 year old , time signing informed consent . Nonsmoker least 6 month cumulative history &lt; = 10 pack year . Pack year = ( No . cigarettes smoked/day/20 ) x ( No . year smoke ) . Body weight &gt; = 50 kilogram . A female subject eligible participate ; Nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy [ definition , `` document '' refers outcome investigator's/designee 's review subject 's medical history study eligibility , obtain via verbal interview subject subject 's medical record ] ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone &gt; 40 milli international unit/milliliter ( mL ) estradiol &lt; 40 picogram/ml ( &lt; 147 picomoles/Liter [ L ] ) confirmatory ] . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrollment . For form HRT , least 2 to4 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method . Childbearing potential negative pregnancy test determine serum human chorionic gonadotropin test screen prior dose Agrees use one contraception method appropriate period time ( determined product label investigator ) prior start dose sufficiently minimize risk pregnancy point . Female subject must agree use contraception follow visit samesex partner , prefer usual lifestyle . Male subject female partner childbearing potential must agree use one contraception method . This criterion must follow time first dose study medication follow visit . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . Aspartate amino transferase alanine amino transferase &lt; 2xupper limit normal ( ULN ) ; alkaline phosphatase bilirubin &lt; = 1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . Based average QT interval correct ( QTc ) value triplicate electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) obtain brief recording period : QTc use Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) &lt; 450 millisecond . A 24 hour Holter ECG screen demonstrates clinically significant abnormality find could interfere interpretation study result , assess appropriately train experienced reviewer . Exclusion Criteria Based Upon Medical Histories Subjects evidence current asthma , confirm Investigator designee . Subjects clinically significant respiratory condition lung pathology could cause cough ( apart chronic idiopathic cough ) . Known lung cancer active malignancy , history . Subjects current chronic history cardiovascular disease ( include uncontrolled hypertension , ischemic heart disease , angina , myocardial infarct , congestive heart failure , stroke ) . Subjects current central nervous system / peripheral nervous system condition e.g . epilepsy myasthenia gravis . Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . Any subject respiratory tract infection within 4 week screen . Radiological image prior study , include chest Xrays , show evidence clinically significant lung disease , judge Investigator designee . History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study define average weekly intake &gt; 21 unit male &gt; 14 unit female . One unit equivalent 8 gram alcohol : halfpint ( approximately 240 mL ) beer , 1 glass ( 125 mL ) wine 1 ( 25 mL ) measure spirit . Any subject history allergic reaction local anesthetic . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . Any subject know hypersensitivity capsaicin citric acid . Exclusion Criteria Based Upon Diagnostic Assessment A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 month screen . Any subject , upon oropharyngeal examination , deem Investigator unsuitable oropharyngeal sensation assessment . This include injury mucosa mouth pharynx could potentially increase systemic absorption e.g . oropharyngeal candidiasis . FEV1 le 80 % predict normal value prior first dose study Any subject reach C5 follow oral inhalation capsaicin dose level 250 micromolar screening . Urinary cotinine level indicative smoke history regular use tobacco nicotinecontaining product within 6 month prior screen . A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen . Other Exclusion Criteria Subjects unable use inhaler satisfactorily . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day period . Lactating female . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Exposure four new chemical entity within 12 month prior first dose day .</criteria>
