	<brief_summary>The study first man , dose escalation study measure safety efficacy TT-034 treatment patient chronic hepatitis C. The study divide 5 dose level . Subjects give single dose deliver IV infusion . The subject monitor data analyze . After set time , 6 10 week depend dose level , next set subject dose . The study drug gene therapy treatment produce molecule destroy Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infect cell . Once study drug give , withdrawn . Additionally , individual receives dose , able receive second dose , remain eligible receive HCV treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This first-time use method therapy design transfer anti-HCV genetic sequence hepatocytes subject infect HCV . The anti-HCV sequence comprise three different short hairpin RNAs ( shRNA ) ability directly cleave RNA genome HCV process know RNA interference . The transfer anti-HCV sequence accomplish use `` vector '' make adenovirus-associated virus ( AAV ) remove viral gene replace non-replicating genetic sequence produce three different shRNA target three different region within HCV gene . This type vector use clinical trial order transduce hepatocytes subject suffer hemophilia .</detailed_description>
