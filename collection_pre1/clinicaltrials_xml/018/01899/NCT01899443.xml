	<brief_summary>Primary total knee total hip replacement surgery costly high volume procedure &amp; outcome may affect surgical &amp; care process &amp; individual patient characteristic . The primary hypothesis non compliance recommend practice impact patient outcome ( e.g . likelihood complication follow surgery ) . The primary aim study evaluate link process &amp; outcomes &amp; possible develop model improve patient outcomes &amp; reduce unnecessary practice variation whilst consider cost .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary aim study identify whether compliance specific process associate well outcomes . The study longitudinal cohort study examine outcome total hip knee replacement surgery . We hypothesise site patient level compliance relate prevalence subsequent complication ( composite outcome comprise 30 day mortality , readmission , reoperation surgical complication ) . METHODS This study select high volume ( &gt; 275 case annually ) public private hospital across Australia . By involve public private site across Australia , generalisability finding enhance . Each site identify site coordinator oversee manage project site . Site coordinator identify site . After hospital discharge , patient follow investigator . This prospective observational study project sample c.2200 consent patient 20 high volume hospital . The site coordinator screen , approach consent eligible patient routine preadmission process . At time consent , patient require : provide socio-demographic detail , past medical history , complete 2 standard patient report outcome measure . Contact patient study make site coordinator routine hospital staff involve acute care . Acute data collection involve prospective audit medical record collect peri- post- operative acute care process data , client characteristic outcomes staff site . Random convenience sample use identify eligible hospital site remain anonymous . Patient follow regard long term outcomes complete via telephone study investigator three additional time point ( approximately 35 90 day 1 year post surgery ) collect repeat data provide patient time consent . Descriptive statistic use profile site level patient level compliance key process care . Multivariable logistic regression ( MLoR ) use identify association binary composite outcome measure patient level compliance . Site individual patient compliance evidence base guideline ( available ) best practice recommendation key process relevant outcome examine ( e.g . Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) prevention ) . Sample size calculation complete ensure analysis sufficient power . If useful association process outcomes identify , cost analysis specific foci undertaken consider cost different factor stage ( e.g . acute / post discharge ) . Secondary analysis determine predictor patient -reported outcome . Depending result initial data analysis , additional secondary analysis potentially include analysis additional time point ( beyond initial 35 day ) association key process outcome , analysis look association specific complication compliance specific process . Interim analysis undertaken assess level observe compliance key process . Re-abstraction acute care data undertaken ensure accuracy completeness submit date site . Site survey Prior study commencement site , site coordinator complete survey detail surgeon protocol key process include VTE antimicrobial prophylaxes . The extent surgeon protocols align Australian practice guideline ascertain . Additional secondary analysis include , may limit : 1. comparison outcome patient go inpatient rehabilitation go directly home surgery . Propensity base score match use determine outcomes well one two group 2. determination predictor 'unhappy knee ' 12 month post surgery . A case control match design use . 3. comparison satisfaction acute care experience private public patient subset 4. comparison outcome THR patient anterior surgical approach posterior approach 5. description ambulation profile immediately post surgery variable associate early ambulation 6. snapshot rehabilitation receive TKA THA</detailed_description>
