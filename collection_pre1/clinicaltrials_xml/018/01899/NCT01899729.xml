	<brief_summary>IMO 8400 second-generation oligonucleotide antagonist endosomal Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) 7 , TLR8 TLR9 . These TLR react complex exogenous nucleic acid ( might encounter infection ) endogenous nucleic acid ( might release tissue damage autoimmune disease ) . In vitro multiple animal model autoimmune disease , IMO-8400 block immune activation mediate TLR7 , 8 9 . In Phase 1 study ( Protocol 8400-001 ) IMO 8400 administer healthy adult SC injection single-doses multiple-doses ( 4 week ) 0.6 mg/kg . All treatment well-tolerated , mild injection site reaction pattern systemic reaction laboratory change . The current study represent first clinical trial IMO-8400 patient active autoimmune disease . Moderate severe plaque psoriasis choose 12-week proof activity trial base prior 4-week study use first generation TLR7 9 antagonist demonstrate clinical improvement patient population .</brief_summary>
