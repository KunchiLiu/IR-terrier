	<brief_summary>The goal investigator work establish nerve transfer best use improve upper extremity function patient cervical level spinal cord injury ( SCI ) . The investigator ' hypothesis nerve transfer safe effective improve function quality life patient loss upper function due spinal cord injury . The investigator plan look upper limb function , health-related quality life patient surgery good understand patient benefit treatment . A nerve transfer procedure use rewire system make muscle work follow SCI . The nerve transfer procedure ( do arm level spinal cord ) use bypass damage area deliver signal brain muscle become disconnected following injury . A donor nerve take another muscle whose use essential transfer help provide critical function . For example , one type nerve transfer do restore lose ability pinch grasp small object finger occur many patient cervical SCI . In surgery , donor nerve normally help flex elbow . This nerve use biceps muscle also work flex elbow . This donor nerve cut re-attached nerve go muscle forearm provide pinch bend tip thumb index finger . Because nerve transfer procedure involve cut reattaching nerve muscle tissue , time require regenerate work connection nerve muscle well allow brain relearn use strengthen muscle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background/Readiness Cervical spinal cord injury ( SCI ) life alter injury result profound loss upper limb function . Nerve transfer surgery transform field peripheral nerve injury surgery , allow remarkable restoration upper limb motor function . The investigator expand use nerve transfer surgery cervical SCI patient first center successfully restore volitional hand function patient C7 motor level injury ( 3 year post-surgery ) . Results 7 patient show early functional gain 3-6 month post-surgery ( gain expect 12 month patient still early course ) . The propose study obtain formative outcome data pilot investigation nerve transfer surgery restore upper extremity function patient cervical SCI . Upper extremity hand function essential basic activity daily live independence ; patient cervical SCI rate important walk sexual performance . Restoration critical upper extremity hand function require unique expertise technical skill hand surgeon ; traditionally tendon transfer/tenodesis use . Although study report reasonable outcome SCI patient procedure , use limit particularly US . Nerve transfer offer alternative promising approach . In peripheral nerve injury , nerve transfer well-established , safe often treatment choice . A nerve transfer use expendable donor nerve coapts nonfunctional recipient nerve restore volitional motor function . Since nerve transfer reinnervates musculotendinous unit responsible absent desire function , procedure : 1 ) biomechanical limitation tendon transfer ; 2 ) use expendable donor nerve whose muscle use tendon transfer ( i.e . brachialis ) ; 3 ) single donor nerve provide one function via reinnervation multiple muscle . Most importantly SCI patient acceptability , nerve transfer require prolonged period immobilization ; early resumption activity encourage . Preliminary Data : Case report offer early evidence novel application nerve transfer may better alternative tendon transfer SCI . Based extensive experience nerve transfer peripheral nerve injury , expect approach profound impact improve function , independence health-related quality life ( QoL ) . The purpose study provide evidence feasibility , safety , outcomes nerve transfer SCI patient via systematically collect data evaluate patient ' perspective benefit disadvantage nerve transfer . These data vital patient selection , patient surgeon education , adaptation well-established technique unique traditionally underserved patient population . Hypothesis Approach : Hypothesis : Nerve transfer safe , effective procedure role treatment armamentarium cervical SCI associate upper extremity dysfunction . Aim 1 : To document safety , time course improvement ( potential nerve transfer improve functional outcome ) assess pre post-operative function . Aim 2 : To evaluate feasibility suitability nerve transfer multidisciplinary evaluation , electrodiagnostic testing , ultrasound , nerve specimen examination correlation clinical outcome . Aim 3 : To assess patient satisfaction acceptability treatment use semi-structured patient interview .</detailed_description>
