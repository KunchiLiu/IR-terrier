	<detailed_description>Background : Flow mediate dilation ( FMD ) brachial artery widely use non-invasive measure endothelial function . FMD independently predict future cardiovascular event readily influence pharmacological , dietary lifestyle intervention . Need review : Differences methodology , guideline ( control moderate factor ) analysis technique contribute large variation FMD laboratory , limit widespread use interpretation FMD data . Objectives : To identify methodological technological factor contribute variability ( i.e . repeatability ) brachial artery FMD . This allow development quality guideline FMD measurement base systematic data analysis . Design : The planning conduct propose meta-analyses follow Cochrane handbook systematic review intervention . The reporting follow Preferred Reporting Items Systematic review Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) guideline . Data source : MEDLINE , EMBASE Chemical Abstracts , Biosis The Cochrane Central Register Controlled Trials search use appropriate search term . Study selection : Observational cohort control group intervention study ≥ 50 subject . Methods : A list quality criterion score FMD data define expert consensus thorough review literature . Subsequently , database brachial artery FMD data ( publish data available individual data ) compile . The investigator investigate quality criterion significantly contribute variability FMD multiple meta-regression analysis . This data set also allow u investigate quality criterion strongest impact variability FMD , refine list quality criterion .</detailed_description>
