	<detailed_description>Despite availability use different class antihypertensive drug , 5-30 % patient still show elevated blood pressure ( EUROASPIRE III survey , 2011 ) . Recently , novel catheter-based radiofrequency ablation technique develop allow renal nerve ablation ( RNA ) . Currently , two different catheter-based system primarily use ( Simplicityw catheter Medtronic-Adrian EnligHTNTM multi-electrode RNA catheter St Jude Medical ) . The RNA technique associate low complication rate , development renal artery stenosis RNA report ( J Am Coll Cardiol 2012 ; 60:2694-2695 ) . Although little known vascular injury induce RNA procedure site ablation , recent study report first time evidence optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) local vascular injury induce radiofrequency energy . Such local tissue damage , apparent angiography , characterize local diffuse vasospasm , oedema formation , endothelial injury thrombus generation ( Templin et al . Eur Heart J , 25 April 2012 ) . Experimental research suggest abnormality present acute phase immediately RNA seem consequence transient phenomenon inflammation ( Clin Res Cardiol 2011 ; 100:1095-1101 ) , similarly occur coronary artery percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . In last decade , multiple study convincingly show pre-procedural administration statins significantly reduce extent cardiac damage time PCI ( Patti et al , JACC 2011 ) . No previous investigation , however , assess whether pre-procedural statin load play protective role renal artery time RNA . Study Population Patients resistant arterial hypertension schedule undergo renal artery ablation Randomization Patients randomize receive two overnight high dos Rosuvastatin ( 40 mg 12 h RNA another 10 mg dose 2 h procedure , N=50 ) placebo ( N=50 ) . Study design Patients randomize receive two overnight high dos Rosuvastatin ( 40 mg 12 h RNA another 10 mg 2 hour prior procedure , N=56 ) placebo ( N=56 ) . RNA perform two different catheter-based system ( Simplicityw catheter Medtronic-Adrian EnligHTNTM multi-electrode RNA catheter St Jude Medical ) . All patient OCT utilize C7-XR imaging system ( Light-Lab Imaging , Inc. , Westford , USA ) renal denervation renal artery . After procedure , patient include Rosuvastatin-group give rosuvastatin 10 mg/day 3 month patient include Placebo-group receive placebo 1 pill/day 3 month . At end 3-month follow-up period , patient undergo repeat OCT renal artery . Sample size If expect incidence 50 % three primary endpoint ( vasospasm , oedema thrombus ) control arm hypothesize 50 % risk reduction incidence rosuvastatin arm , total sample size 112 patient would provide 80 % power detect difference alpha level 0.05 . Duration trial : 1 year Primary End-point Optical coherence tomography evidence vascular injury induce radiofrequency energy , detect evidence least one follow 3 abnormality : - Presence ( vs. absence ) local diffuse vasospasm ( i.e . define immediate loss lumen area lumen diameter part renal artery ) - Presence ( vs.r absence ) oedema formation ( i.e . define significant endothelial-intimal notch detect luminal wall surface ) - Presence ( vs. absence ) endothelial injury ( i.e . disruption superficial intimal lining define endothelial detachment vessel dissection ) thrombus generation ( i.e . protrude mass attach luminal surface diameter 0.5 mm least three follow cross-sections ) Secondary End-points - Comparison extent vascular injury two catheter-based system use study ( EnligHTNTM vs. Simplicityw ) - Comparison vs. baseline 24-hour 48-hour post-procedural change CRP , creatinine . eGFR ( express ml/min/1.73 m2 ) , urine albumin : creatinine ratio , absolute value NGAL ( Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ) . Expected finding According previous preliminary experience optical coherence tomography ( Templin et al . Eur Heart J , 25 April 2012 ) , expect frequency vascular injury statin-na√Øve patient 42 % vasospasm , 96 % oedema , 67 % thrombus . We expect reduction least 25 % frequency abnormalities pre-treatment rosuvastatin .</detailed_description>
