	<brief_summary>Artemisinin-based combination therapy ( ACTs ) recommend use uncomplicated malaria area multi-drug resistant malaria . The Ministry Health , Division Malaria Control ( DOMC ) roll use artemether-lumefantrine first line treatment uncomplicated malaria 2006.The development ACTs derivative rapidly act current antimalarial drug recognition potential role component combination therapy lead several large trial aim assess different combination exist drug , specific development new combination drug . This proposal aim ( 1 ) evaluate efficacy artemisinin-based anti-malaria combination drug different site across Kenya ( 2 ) elucidate marker resistance ACTs molecular genetics process strengthen capacity propose study sit well improve link research control ultimately influence malaria treatment policy practice . Five group East Africa conduct multi-centre , randomise , two arm trial ass efficacy dihydroartemisin-piperaquine artemether-lumefantrine comparative drug . The network determine antimalarial drug efficacy use standardised protocol collate clinical response adverse event . Molecular marker artemisinin resistance investigate molecular sequence comparison parasite profile drug failure case . Recrudescence re-infections differentiate analysis MSP1 , MSP2 GLURP gene assess transmission dynamic post treatment . Data study capture database developed network . The latter offer several advantage include - Working towards standardization methodology common protocols way compare data across site - Pulling together datasets conduct multi-centre analysis - Sharing coordinate quality assurance mechanism</brief_summary>
