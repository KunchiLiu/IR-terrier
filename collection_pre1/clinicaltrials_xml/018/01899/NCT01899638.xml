	<detailed_description>Vilanterol trifenatate ( VI ) potent selective long-acting β2 agonist ; Umeclidinium bromide ( UMEC ) long-acting , inhale , muscarinic receptor antagonist ( LAMA ) . Both compound development daily treatment Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . This study randomize , open label , three-period crossover , balance incomplete block study ass pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , safety tolerability UMEC ( 62.5µg 125µg ) VI ( 25µg ) monotherapies combination 20 healthy Chinese subject . Each subject receive three five possible treatment 10 day . Blood sample PK analysis take design timepoints . Safety assess measurement ECG QTcF , heart rate , blood pressure , safety laboratory data review adverse event .</detailed_description>

This criterion follow time first dose study medication completion followup visit Normal systolic ( 90139mmHg ) diastolic ( 6089mmHg ) blood pressure prestudy screen . Subjects current nonsmoker , use tobacco product 6 month period precede screen visit , pack history 10 pack year . ( pack year = ( cigarette per day smoked/20 ) × number year smoke ) ) . No significant abnormality 12lead ECG screening , QTcF interval must &lt; 450msec ( QTcF ; machine manual reading ) . AST ( SGOT ) , ALT ( SGPT ) , totalbilirubin 1.5xULN screening . No significant clinical abnormality laboratory test . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . Subjects able use inhalation device satisfactorily As result medical interview , physical examination screen investigation , principle investigator delegate physician deems subject unsuitable study . History mental , cardiac , renal , hepatic , significant gastrointestinal respiratory disease judge investigator A history breathing problem ( i.e . history asthmatic symptomatology , unless asthma childhood resolve long require maintenance therapy exclusion ) . A chest Xray compute tomography ( CT ) scan reveals evidence clinically significant abnormality . A chest Xray must take day 1 first treatment chest Xray CT scan available within 6 month prior day . History sensitivity heparin , heparininduced thrombocytopenia , sensitivity study medication , component thereof , know allergy hypersensitivity milk protein excipients lactose monohydrate magnesium stearate ( MgSt ) , history drug allergy , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . The subject take prescription nonprescription drug , include CYP3A/PGP inhibitor , vitamin , herbal dietary supplement ( include St John 's Wort ) within 7 day ( 14 day drug potential enzyme inducer ) 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study medication , unless opinion Investigator Sponsor medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety .
