	<brief_summary>Chronic neuropathic pain affect million individual worldwide . It cause marked reduction health , utility quality life represent considerable economic burden society due loss work capacity large treatment expense . The propose project explore new rational method deep brain stimulation treatment patient severe chronic neuropathic pain , resistant conventional treatment . Deep brain stimulation neurosurgical procedure small stimulating electrode implant deep brain area . Furthermore , utilize new positron emission tomography neuroimaging new prototyped technology , call target transcranial magnetic stimulation , predict outcome deep brain stimulation localize brain region maximum symptom relief patient . This optimize selection patient deep brain stimulation provide rational customized choice brain target patient , without surgical intervention . Novel technique validate healthy volunteer time provide new insight mechanisms underlie brain stimulation pain perception . The project great clinical impact , potential innovative development industrial spin-out , facilitate exchange Danish research talent senior researcher Stanford University California Pacific Medical Research Institute San Francisco , unite world lead expert pain research clinical treatment achieve goal .</brief_summary>
