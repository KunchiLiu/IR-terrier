	<brief_title>Efficacy Saftey Study 99mTc-ECDG Evaluation Coronary Artery Disease ( CAD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective , open-label , multi-center study assess efficacy safety 99mTc-EC-DG compare 99mTc-SPECT MPI image detect presence , location , severity CAD establish coronary angiography . Approximately 60 patient enrol study . Group 1 patient evaluated CAD within 3 30 day cardiovascular diagnostic imaging method ( nuclear , ultrasound , CTA , MRI , etc . ) physician plan coronary angiography angiography yet perform . In addition , patient coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) . These patient enrol . Group 2 patient evaluated CAD within 3 30 day cardiovascular diagnostic imaging method ( nuclear , ultrasound , CTA , MRI , etc . ) patient already coronary angiography perform received coronary intervention subsequent procedure . The following sequence image procedure perform Group 1 2 patient : The first procedure 99mTc-EC-DG rest study . This follow within 24 hour 3 day 1-day protocol 99mTc-SPECT MPI rest/stress study . This follow within 24 hour 3 day 99mTc-EC-DG stress study . For Group 1 2 , 1 diagnostic imaging procedure perform evaluate presence CAD traditional 99mTc-SPECT MPI rest/stress study , procedure must repeat 1 3 SPECT imaging procedure require trial protocol . The modality provocative stress test ( exercise , pharmacologic , exercise/pharmacologic ) match 99mTc-SPECT study 99mTc-EC-DG study . All prospectively perform 99mTc-EC-DG 99mTc-SPECT study conduct use regadenoson pharmacologic stress agent . All image study ( 99mTc-EC-DG , 99mTc-SPECT , coronary angiography ) over-read blind , trained reviewer . The consensus blind read determine record location CAD relate wall myocardium affect include : anterior , Inferior , lateral , septal apex . The angiography study identify artery associate CAD ; namely , leave anterior descending , circumflex right coronary artery . The study also determine severity CAD visually compare size intensity ischemic signal rest stress image obtain approximately 15 60 minute post injection . The result consensus blind read coronary angiography consider truth presence , location , severity obstructive CAD degree stenosis .</detailed_description>
