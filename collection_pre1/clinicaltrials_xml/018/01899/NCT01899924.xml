	<detailed_description>In order test relevance theoretical model cognitive function , examination patient cerebral lesion great interest . Thus , goal study assess cognitive processing patient combination behavioural clinical test ERP ( event relate potential ) specific marker . Indeed , ERP technique make possible ascertain patient control subject perform task ask even subject performs task covertly . From ERPs marker , investigate respective cortical generator . By compare result obtain healthy pathological population , able appreciate differential processing stimuli two different population try correlate difference specific cerebral lesion different outcomes.We previously demonstrate relevance approach field disorder consciousness patient project enrich specific approach addition new marker extension field cognitive behavioural neurology . The procedure follow . After obtain write informed consent , patient examine clinically dedicate specialized scale ( example CRS-R disorder consciousness patient ) . Then , probe event relate potential stimulate patient various stimulus embed well-designed paradigm scalp EEG record . Following different step signal processing mean ERPs accord condition extract statistical analysis perform . At one year recording , outcome collect correlated obtained ERPs .</detailed_description>
