	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Liver Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate feasibility safety stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) liver treatment hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate radiographic local response , local control time local progression ( TTLP ) treat lesion HCC patient liver SBRT . II . To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) cancer specific survival ( CSS ) HCC patient treat liver SBRT . III . To evaluate explanted irradiated liver tissue ( patient proceed liver transplantation ) determine extent residual tumor extent radiation effect within around irradiated field . OUTLINE : Patients undergo SBRT every day 2 week ( 5 fraction total ) absence unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
