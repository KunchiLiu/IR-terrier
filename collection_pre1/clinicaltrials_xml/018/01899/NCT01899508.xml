	<brief_title>Virtual Reality Osteoarthritis Knee Pain Pilot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study examine feasibility acceptability new virtual reality ( VR ) protocol use iPod Touch/iPhone ( similar smartphone ) deliver virtual reality ( VR ) . The secondary objective study gather preliminary data efficacy potential benefit VR protocol individual suffer persistent osteoarthritis ( OA ) pain knee . Study activity population group:30 patient clinical diagnosis osteoarthritis ( OA ) knee ( ) recruit clinic Duke Division Rheumatology Duke Department Orthopedic Surgery . All participant complete screen measure , baseline set measure , virtual reality training session , post-training measure . Participants include 30 OA patient . Inclusion criterion include : 1 ) diagnosis OA knee ( ) , 2 ) age 18 , 3 ) able read speak English , 4 ) OA relate pain upon movement . 5 ) Self-reported normal correct normal vision , 6 ) Self-reported normal hearing . Cybersickness possible risk , type motion sickness often involve feeling nausea , eyestrain and/or dizziness . Anticipated risk associate cybersickness comparable typical `` everyday '' use computer . If participant begin feel effect type , he/she may immediately remove virtual reality device his/her eye stop treatment . Patients ask report symptom option discontinue participation symptom problematic . Third , participant may experience anxiety distress due question thought , feeling , and/or experience OA pain . Again , participant option discontinue participation experience problem complete measure . Finally , also possibility breach confidentiality . The informed consent process address possibility . All effort make confidentiality maintain . In term data analysis , series analysis perform derive treatment effect size estimate ( use eta square ) 95 % confidence interval outcomes . While investigator expect mostly moderate effect size , give sample size fact preliminary pilot study , study team examine within-group difference alpha .10 . To evaluate treatment effect outcome measure , analytic strategy involve two analysis . In first analysis , multivariate analysis-of-variance model use make within group comparison unadjusted baseline variable . In second ( primary ) analysis , multivariate analysis-of-covariance model use ; covariates pre-treatment score outcome measure .</detailed_description>
