	<brief_title>The Purpose This Study Evaluate Spirometric Effect ( Trough FEV1 ) Umeclidinium/Vilanterol 62.5/25 mcg Once Daily Compared With Tiotropium 18mcg Once Daily Over 12-week Treatment Period Subjects With COPD Who Continue Have Symptoms Tiotropium</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase IIIb multicentre , randomize , blind , double-dummy , parallel group study evaluate efficacy safety UMEC/VI Inhalation Powder ( 62.5/25 mcg ) administer once-daily via ELLIPTA dry powder inhaler ( DPI ) [ note : ELLIPTA DPI may also refer Novel DPI ( NDPI ) DPI ] compare tiotropium ( 18 mcg ) administer once-daily via HandiHaler treatment period 12 week subject COPD continue symptom tiotropium . The target population study include subject continue symptom tiotropium . The study screen approximately 650 subject continue symptom whilst tiotropium . After 4 week run-in period open label tiotropium , subject continue symptom adhere treatment schedule progress treatment phase . At end run-in phase approximately 490 subject randomise 1:1 UMEC/VI Inhalation Powder ( 62.5/25 mcg ) , tiotropium ( 18 mcg ) . During treatment phase , subject receive two inhaler , preloaded ELLIPTA DPI HandiHaler dry powder inhaler capsule , once-daily administration one active treatment one placebo treatment 12 week . There total 8 study visit . Subjects sign inform consent form ( ICF ) either Visit 0 Visit 1 assign subject identifier . Subjects meet eligibility criterion Screening ( Visit 1 ) enter open label tiotropium run-in phase . After 4 week subject review ( Visit 2 ) satisfy randomisation criterion randomise enter treatment phase . After Visit 2 , 6 study clinic visit . Further visit schedule Day 2 , Week 4 , Week 8 , Week 12 Week 12 +1 day ( Visits 3 7 respectively ) . Vital sign ( blood pressure pulse rate ) obtain clinic visit . Trough FEV₁and trough FVC perform Visit 3 Visit 7 . Pre-dose post dose FEV₁and FVC measurement 5 15 min 1 3 hr also perform Visit 2 , Visit 4 , Visit 5 Visit 6 . At select study site , subset approximately 200 subject perform 24-hour serial spirometry Visit 2 Visit 6 evaluation lung function dose period . An assessment dyspnea obtain use Baseline Transition Dyspnea Index ( BDI/TDI ) . At Visit 2 , severity dyspnea baseline assess use BDI . Change baseline assess use TDI Visit 4 , Visit 5 Visit 6 . In addition baseline assessment Visit 2 , health status capture use St. George Respiratory Questionnaire COPD ( SGRQ-C ) scale Visit 4 Visit 6 . The impact COPD subject 's wellbeing daily life measure use COPD Assessment Test ( CAT ) Euroqol-5D ( EQ5D ) .. In addition baseline assessment Visit 2 , CAT EQ-5D also complete Visit 4 Visit 6 . Furthermore , CAT also complete screen . The Patient Global Rating COPD Severity Change COPD Severity selfreported global assessment severity illness perform Baseline Visit 2 Visit 4 Visit 6 . Visits 0/1 7 clinic visit conduct outpatient basis . A safety Follow-Up assessment ( Visit 8 ) conduct either phone call clinic visit require approximately 7 day end study treatment ( Visit 7 Early Withdrawal , applicable ) . The total duration subject participation , include follow-up , approximately 18 week . All subject provide albuterol/salbutamol use `` as-needed '' basis throughout run-in study treatment period . For determination subject disposition , subject consider complete study upon completion Visit 7 ( last on-treatment clinic visit ) . There plan compassionate use study medication .</detailed_description>
