	<brief_summary>The effectiveness surgical fundoplication treat classical reflux symptom well document , role surgery alleviate extra-esophageal symptom allegedly secondary gastro-esophageal reflux disease ( GORD ) far assess . The effectiveness anti-reflux surgery extra-esophageal reflux symptom vary 15 % 95 % ; spread data largely attributable disparate study design methodology , patient selection , outcome metric . In order ass whether anti-reflux surgery may beneficial effect chronic cough allegedly secondary GERD eventually identify preoperative clinical profile could predict positive effect , consider two group patient present 1 ) GERD associate chronic cough , 2 ) , typical GERD underwent anti-reflux surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pre-operatively , patient routinely underwent symptom assessment , barium swallow , upper gastro-intestinal endoscopy esophageal manometry . The type severity symptom grade reflux oesophagitis score use questionnaire semi-quantitative scale . The upper gastro-intestinal ( GI ) endoscopy , barium swallow esophageal manometry perform accord standard technique ; reflux esophagitis report accord Los Angeles classification . In absence Los Angeles grade A high esophagitis , patient underwent 24h pH-recording intraluminal impedance/pH monitoring . Patients complain chronic cough submit specific work-up consist chest High Resolution Computed Tomography ( HRCT ) scan , methacholine challenge test spirometry order exclude pulmonary disease . Surgery perform patient negative pulmonary disease chest HRCT scan , methacholine challenge test spirometry , consideration fact patient refer mainly therapy chronic cough . The study start 1995 closed 2010 .</detailed_description>
