	<brief_summary>This study randomize control non-blinded double arm study examine effect routine postoperative oral antibiotic therapy prevent postoperative surgical site infection breast reconstruction . The investigator hypothesize use prophylactic antibiotic breast reconstruction reduce surgical site infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Antibiotics Tissue Expanders Breast Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgical site infection occur one-third patient undergo implant-based breast reconstruction follow mastectomy cancer ; case require subsequent prosthetic removal . This elevated risk relative surgical procedure patient population attribute cancer-related immunocompromise , foreign body placement , postoperative drainage tube maintenance , chemoradiotherapy administration . The use extend postoperative prophylactic antibiotic prevalent amongst plastic surgeon despite lack evidence support efficacy practice . Further , National Surgical Care Initiative Project ( SCIP ) sponsor Centers Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services ( CMS ) mandate discontinuation antibiotic 24 hour surgery , extension fails reduce infection risk general surgical population , also may contribute bacterial resistance . The primary objective study compare risk surgical site infection implant-reconstruction patient receive extend prophylactic antibiotic . In randomized-controlled trial , woman single institution undergo implant-based breast reconstruction assign receive either less 24 hour 7 day prophylactic postoperative antibiotic . Primary outcome measure include development superficial incisional , deep incisional , organ/space surgical site infection one year define Centers Disease Control ( CDC ) . Following adjustment patient age , body mass index , comorbid disease , reconstructive timing , disease stage , adjuvant therapy , implant volume , drain use , procedural variable , relative risk postoperative infection use extend prophylactic antibiotic estimate . Secondary outcome measure include prosthetic explantation , case infection , bacteriology antibiotic susceptibility .</detailed_description>
