	<brief_title>Time Treatment Utilizing Tele-Retinal Referral System Wet Age Related Macular Degeneration Diabetic Macular Edema : A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Within province Ontario , limited number retinal specialist large geographically diverse population 13.5 million people 2012 . Because majority specialist locate large urban center , many rural patient difficulty travel significant distance community city . Currently Ontario optometrists responsible triaging retinal eye disease ; emergency referral endophthalmitis organize same-day telephone consultation , routine referral schedule fax . This current method triage particular important consideration . Because limited number retinal specialist long wait time lead permanent vision loss referral inaccurate , patient see treat sooner instead later case wet age-related macular degeneration ( wAMD ) Diabetic Macular Edema ( DME ) . In addition , essential vision test fluorescein angiography ( FA ) often available hospital set rather within physician optometrist ' office . For patient rural remote community , inconvenience could result lose wage , long return trip back next day even overnight stay . Teleophthalmology branch telemedicine delivers eye care digital equipment telecommunication technology . It offer unique advantage , ability integrate electronic health record , ability view multiple member health care team , potentially reduce wait time travel time ophthalmologist . Within Canada , different teleophthalmology initiative provide access specialist optometrists primary care practitioner particularly rural remote area , improve ophthalmologic care reduce unnecessary patient travel expenditure . These teleophthalmology system include fundus Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) image aid ophthalmologist accurately diagnose triaging referral . Hanson et al . retrospective case series note tele-referrals retinal specialist optometrist reduce average travel time , travel distance number office visit retina specialist improve efficiency clinical examination , test , treatment . However , currently research know study team actively compare time treatment patient base teleophthalmology referral assessment versus conventional paper referral system optometrists retinal specialist . For condition like wAMD DME relate Diabetic Retinopathy often refer via teleophthalmology , difference time treatment could prevent vision loss . The inclusion fundus OCT image teleophthalmology could also improve triage accuracy prioritization referral appointment retinal specialist . This study focus compare time treatment tele-retinal referral system paper referral system focus two prevalent retinal condition : wet AMD DME . The result could demonstrate tele-ophthalmology reduce time treatment patient wet AMD DME Ontario , improve access retinal specialist allow efficient triage patient .</detailed_description>
