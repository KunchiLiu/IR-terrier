	<brief_summary>This randomize , placebo control trial dietary zinc S-adenosylmethionine ( SAMe ) otherwise healthy alcoholic US Veterans . The primary goal determine either dietary zinc S-adenosylmethionine ( SAMe ) augment lung immune defenses alcoholic thereby decrease risk lung injury infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Examination Zinc , S-adenosylmethionine , Combination Therapy Versus Placebo Alcoholics</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alcohol abuse major burden society even problem Veteran population . Chronic alcohol ingestion serious health consequence include pneumonia acute lung injury , occur suddenly without warn even physically fit individual without apparent sign alcohol dependence . Therefore , vital health Veterans indeed entire population identify effective treatment limit even prevent devastate consequence . The primary goal clinical research project determine dietary zinc supplement antioxidant S-adenosylmethionine ( SAMe ) augment lung immune defense otherwise healthy alcoholic thereby decrease risk lung injury infection . There already strong evidence investigator ' experimental animal model moderate daily alcohol ingestion little six week cause oxidative stress zinc deficiency lung . These derangement result insult dysfunction alveolar macrophage , resident immune cell , predispose animal development pneumonia . Importantly , animal model , investigator find add either zinc antioxidant diet prevents problem preserve lung health even daily alcohol ingestion . This project translate basic finding animal model clinical set determine whether zinc SAMe supplement effective human pathologically consume alcohol . This project enroll Veterans see Atlanta Veterans Hospital Substance Abuse Treatment Program ( SATP ) . Participants evaluate undergoing procedure obtain sample fluid lung , measure zinc level , redox potential , assess well alveolar macrophage respond bacteria ( determine phagocytic capacity ) . After completion initial evaluation , participant randomize receive standard treatment ( placebo ) , zinc supplement , dietary SAMe , combination zinc SAMe 14 day . All subject evaluate two week undergo treatment . At end two week period , measurement lung zinc , redox potential macrophage function repeat compare two group . The hypothesis dietary zinc SAM supplement improve immune function alveolar macrophage . If project successful , lead large clinical trial determine either dietary zinc and/or SAMe supplement effective even acute clinical setting improve outcome alcoholic develop pneumonia acute lung injury . Overall , zinc SAMe supplement safe inexpensive provide , allow potential treatment easily implement Veteran population well society general . Given significant burden unhealthy alcohol use , investigator need way limit physical consequence alcohol abuse investigator continue effort public education addiction treatment .</detailed_description>
