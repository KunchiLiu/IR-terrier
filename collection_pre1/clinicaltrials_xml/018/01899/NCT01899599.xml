	<brief_title>PankoMab-GEX™ Versus Placebo Maintenance Therapy Advanced Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study evaluate efficacy PankoMab-GEX v Placebo maintain response 2nd 4th line chemotherapy patient epithelial ovarian fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer . Patients must respond platinum base chemotherapy previous line , response recent Pt-based chemotherapy must last 12 month . In addition response recent 2 line chemotherapy prior start study medication must last 12 month .</detailed_description>

Life expectancy &gt; 3 month . 13 . Ability willingness give write informed consent . 1 . Refractory platinumbased chemotherapy ( define remain progressive become progressive previous platinumbased regimen ) . 2 . Progressionfree interval &gt; 12 month recent antecedent platinumbased chemotherapy regimen . 3 . Concomitant antitumor therapy immunotherapy . 4 . Treatment monoclonal antibody investigational agent ≤30 day randomization ( Note : prior antiMUC1 therapy permit time ) . 5 . Limitedfield radiotherapy ≤30 day randomization ( Note : extensive prior radiotherapy follow last line chemotherapy permit ; radiotherapy prior last line chemotherapy permit ) . 6 . Prior allergic reaction monoclonal antibody , grade 3 IRR grade 4 reaction monoclonal antibody . 7 . Known sensitivity component test product . 8 . Contraindication premedications use study ( paracetamol/acetaminophen , H1 and/or H2 receptor antagonist , steroid ) . 9 . Clinical evidence brain metastasis leptomeningeal involvement . 10 . Patients second primary cancer , except : adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , curatively treated insitu cancer cervix , Ductal Carcinoma Situ ( DCIS ) , stage 1 grade 1 endometrial carcinoma , solid tumor include lymphoma ( without bone marrow involvement ) curatively treat evidence disease ≥ 5 year . 11 .
