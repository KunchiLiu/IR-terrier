	<brief_summary>The care acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) significantly improve learning experimental physiological research work series randomize controlled trial . The mortality syndrome remain however high . Numerous experimental clinical work demonstrate ventilatory mode authorize patient make , acute phase , spontaneous breathing cycle superimpose assistance deliver ventilator ( BIPAP-APRV mode ) allow improve gas exchange hemodynamic tolerance ventilation reduce need sedative drug . This ventilatory mode could also reduce risk diaphragmatic dysfunction induce ventilation . Consequently , hypothesis ventilatory mode could allow reduction mortality ARDS patient . The aim multicenter , prospective , randomize , control , open study compare effect two ventilatory strategy mortality ARDS patient place mechanical ventilation .</brief_summary>
