	<brief_summary>Background : - Cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) liquid around brain spinal cord . Many disease diagnose examine CSF . A lumbar puncture use collect test CSF . Once someone already lumbar puncture , small extra amount CSF collect time . This fluid use study brain , nerve , related health issue . Researchers want collect CSF blood sample people schedule lumbar puncture . Objectives : - To collect cerebrospinal fluid blood sample individual lumbar puncture . Eligibility : - Individuals 2 100 year age schedule lumbar puncture clinical research purpose . Design : - Participants lumbar puncture clinical research purpose . - During procedure , additional sample CSF collect . They also provide blood sample , one take time procedure . - Treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study plan establish repository cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , serum , plasma . We plan collect small amount additional CSF blood subject already go lumbar puncture part research clinical care National Institutes Health ( NIH ) . This allow u study whether association neurological diseases biomarkers , help identify novel pathogen infect central nervous system , well enable u understand immune response infection future protocol . CSF blood well clinical data associate sample store securely .</detailed_description>
