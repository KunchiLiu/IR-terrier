	<brief_summary>Interstitial lung disease ( ILD ) characterise inflammation scar lung lead cause death patient systemic sclerosis , contribute significantly morbidity mortality many connective tissue disease ( CTDs ) polymyositis/dermatomyositis mixed connective tissue disease . When ILD extensive and/or progressive , immunosuppressive medication often require stabilize lung disease alleviate symptom . Current standard care CTD associate ILD extrapolate study perform individual systemic sclerosis comprises low dose corticosteroid intravenous cyclophosphamide follow oral azathioprine . In individual even intensive immunosuppression insufficient prevent deterioration , significant minority affect individual result respiratory failure death . Rituximab recently report effective 'rescue therapy ' stabilize even improve ILD patient group . Based observation gain experience , investigator believe rituximab potential important alternative current best therapy patient group . This study therefore initiated evaluate efficacy rituximab ( compare standard therapy ) patient progressive CTD related ILD .</brief_summary>
