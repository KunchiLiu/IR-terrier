	<brief_summary>The deficiency alpha-1 antitrypsin ( DA1AT ) genetic disorder variable clinical expression , initially describe adult pulmonary emphysema patient . In child , second cause neonatal cholestasis biliary atresia common indication liver transplantation . Several genotype SERPINA1 gene cod alpha-1 anti-trypsin identify . The main one M / M , M / Z , M / S Z / Z genotype closely correlated concentration blood A1AT . The estimate France suggest prevalence genotype deficit Z / Z order 1/6054 , ( 9982 patient ) , 11 % case , liver disease ( prolonged neonatal jaundice ) . Half move towards development cirrhosis portal hypertension , worst liver transplantation . Currently , know clinical genetic factor predispose patient A1AT deficiency develop liver damage . Recent study lead u think polymorphisms gene SERPINA1 , well alpha-mannosidase 1 endoplasmic reticulum ( Erman gene ) could predictive marker liver complication . Another possible candidate gene one importin beta ( KPNB1 ) , protein involved elimination misfolded protein . These data lead u propose study genetic polymorphism . The main objective study compare allele frequency polymorphisms ( ) cohort A1AT deficient patient hepatic symptom ( portal hypertension complication , severe liver failure lead transplant , indication liver transplantation ) ( ii ) cohort A1AT deficient patient without sign hepatic call . To build last cohort , include genetic study family member deficient patient , probably carry deficit genotype Z / Z without associate clinical manifestation . This allow u facilitate establishment genotype profile / phenotype clearly identify , allow appropriate care child may development , strive achieve haplotype interpretation polymorphism find . This study conduct association DEFI-ALPHA study identify clinical biological prognostic factor age diagnosis , diagnostic mode , result liver biopsy ( available ) , clinical course , family history , existence IUGR long-term treatment . The secondary objective study : - The measurement interpretation serum IL-8 A1AT-deficient patient . Indeed , one study show high IL-8 patient ulcerative colitis compare healthy patient ' serum . These consideration lead u hypothesize IL-8 may marker liver disease A1AT deficiency . - Preservation blood sample study gene , may future suspect associated occurrence liver complication . To end , DNA bank create . It involve child deficiency alpha-1 antitrypsin family 1st 2nd degree civil law ( parent sibling ) . This study continuation cohort DEFI-ALPHA ( descriptive study cohort child DA1AT ) seek identify clinical biological factor age diagnosis , diagnosis mode , result set liver biopsy ( available ) , clinical course , family history , presence IUGR long-term treatment . The criterion not-inclusion , accord subject , lack consent child parent , lack consent adult patient , lack consent witness . Demographic clinical history data ( parent brothers/sisters show DA1AT ) collect . Currently , cohort patient DA1AT set framework `` Cohort DEFI-ALPHA . '' This multicenter project realize help french pediatric hepatology center regularly follow patient DA1AT . Today , 100 patient DA1AT already identify , collection historical data already begin several center since September 2009 . This study therefore continuation work . Over period 30 month , total number potentially includable subject estimate 400 study ( 100 patient 300 relate first degree parent , brother sister ) . This study promote Hospices Civils de Lyon . Authorization competent authority ethical committee obtain well informed consent family blood sampling .</brief_summary>
