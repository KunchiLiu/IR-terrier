	<brief_summary>Anti-neutrophil cytoplasm antibody ( ANCA ) -associated vasculitis rare diseases characterized inflammation blood vessel . Among numerous cell type play role vasculitis , one key actor neutrophil . Neutrophils equip powerful molecule use destroy invading microbe . Therefore , mechanism control neutrophil activation tightly control . If case , neutrophil may destroy tissue host . This happen chronic inflammation vasculitis . Autoantibodies direct neutrophil , ANCA , produce thus demonstrate neutrophil also target immune system disease . In addition , molecular study provide evidence gene normally silence mature neutrophil normal condition re-expressed neutrophils patient ANCA-associated vasculitis thus strongly suggest profound deregulation neutrophil function condition . Notably , investigator preliminary data show neutrophils patient granulomatosis polyangiitis ( GPA , formerly Wegener 's granulomatosis ) , ANCA-associated vasculitis , interfere normal phase resolution inflammation . The objective investigator ' study understand mechanism underlie increased activation state determine neutrophil could use define prognostic marker clinician optimize patient ' care . Therefore , investigator plan study expression protein implicate GPA pathophysiology membrane neutrophil undergo apoptosis . The investigator also study deregulation protein expression neutrophil . This point molecular translation neutrophil deregulation . This technique powerful well adapt identify mass spectrometry proteins differentially express control disease state . After identification protein differentially express patient GPA , investigator investigate whether expression modulate disease course and/or modify treatment . The investigator believe understand neutrophil perturbation lead good monitoring disease activity . Ultimately , investigator may propose targeted anti-inflammatory therapy would well tolerate patient . investigator also identify new marker disease activity allow clinician define well therapeutic strategy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A - Specific Aims General aim : This project design study physiopathological mechanism involve GPA cellular molecular level . investigator want study neutrophil prognostic factor determine implication PR3 , major autoantigen resolution phase inflammation . investigator ' work hypothesis structural functional analysis PR3 neutrophils help investigator unravel role GPA . Hence , long-term objective good understand mechanism involve modulation PR3 expression membrane neutrophil order inhibit activation propose novel anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategy adapt GPA . Present project : The investigator recently demonstrate human neutrophil ) PR3 express membrane neutrophil apoptosis absence degranulation , ii ) PR3 member molecular scaffold comprise phospholipidscramblase1 ( scramblase ) calreticulin externalize apoptosis , iii ) apoptosis-induced PR3 membrane expression impair macrophage reprogramming phagocytosis apoptotic neutrophils The investigator ' hypothesis PR3 might specific molecular partner facilitate externalization and/or persistence plasma membrane neutrophil apoptosis thus potentiate auto-antigenic capacity . The specific aim : 1 . Characterization apoptosis neutrophil GPA patient 2 . Analysis PR3 partner ( CD16 , CD11b , Calreticulin , Phospholipidscramblase1 ) co-expressed protein interest inflammation ( AnnexinA1 , ) expression neutrophils patient GPA compare healthy control 3 . Identification new partner PR3 neutrophils 4 . Analysis proteome neutrophil GPA patient B . Background Significance 1.1 . Introduction GPA systemic vasculitis mainly associate anti-PR3 ANCA . The role activate neutrophils vasculitis lesion suggest presence perivascular infiltrates , especially kidney glomeruli lung . PR3 serine protease first describe within azurophilic granule neutrophils NOT suppose fuse plasma membrane release within phagolysosome phagocytosis pathogen . We show first time subcellular localization PR3 restrict azurophilic granule , previously think , PR3 localize secretory vesicle , highly mobilizable compartment , thus explain presence PR3 surface rest isolated neutrophil . Moreover , high percentage neutrophil express PR3 observe vasculitis patient could consider risk factor vasculitis . This high expression membrane PR3 patient GPA result increase ANCA-induced respiratory burst neutrophils thus enhance inflammatory process . In vitro binding ANCA PR3 trigger respiratory burst , degranulation release pro-inflammatory cytokine . Because PR3 membrane expression important pathophysiological event GPA since prerequisite subsequent activation neutrophil ANCA , seek determine mechanism involve PR3 membrane expression . In neutrophil , demonstrate apoptosis trigger significantly increase membrane PR3 expression without degranulation . In experiment , fail detect MPO membrane neutrophil . Our result differ previously report data show MPO PR3 externalize apoptosis translocation azurophilic granule plasma membrane . This phenomenon seem occur neutrophil undergo late apoptosis secondary necrosis , lead expression granule protein cell surface . Apoptosis-induced PR3 externalization could great relevance pathophysiology GPA PR3 , suppose intracellular antigen , thus expose plasma membrane apoptotic cell thus amplify pro-inflammatory potential , immunogenic property interfere macrophage phagocytosis . We also demonstrate apoptosis PR3 expression associate expression calreticulin , well-known `` eat-me signal '' . We finally evidence presence PR3 impair reprogramming macrophage anti-inflammatory profile phagocytosis apoptotic cell CRT/LRP pathway . It hypothesize expression complex PR3/scramblase/CRT partner ( CD11b , CD16 ) surface apoptotic neutrophil could constitute good prognosis markers.. Gene array study point deregulation neutrophil GPA . We make hypothesis proteome neutrophil GPA patient would informative activation state , survival state could biological marker clinical severity . It thus pertinent study deregulation neutrophils life cycle : oxidative burst activation , physiologic apoptosis , expression PR3 partner . This study perform neutrophils patient GPA compare age sex adjust healthy control . C. Preliminary study Analysis apoptosis neutrophil GPA patient In literature , neutrophils patient ANCA associate vasculitis ( AAV ) find disturbed TNFα-induced apoptosis tend high rate apoptosis control . However , publish data physiologic apoptosis spontaneous apoptosis neutrophil undergo absence exogenous stimulus contradictory . When calf foetal serum add medium , neutrophils GPA patient display similar apoptosis rate control . When serum patient use , neutrophils AAV patient remission high survival rate vivo control , difference disappear normal serum use . These result agreement discovery GPA patient high expression PCNA associate survival . Therefore , want study apoptosis rate neutrophil GPA diagnosis , relapse remission whole blood . These result compare age sex match control . Apoptosis evaluate phosphatidylserine externalization measure flow cytometry annexin-V label 7-AAD stain CD15+ cell . PCNA expression also investigate different clinical stage proteomic profile apoptotic neutrophil perform . Analysis scramblase/ Calreticulin expression neutrophil GPA patient In cellular model ( RBL cell line ) , demonstrate scramblase extinction shRNA associate decreased expression phosphatidylserine apoptosis PR3 apoptosis induce expression also impair ( unpublished data ) . We also able demonstrate vitro scramblase PR3 physically interact . During apoptosis , PR3 also associate calreticulin membrane neutrophil . These data suggest association PR3/Scramblase/Calreticulin form molecular scaffold functional platform could interfere recognition pathway ( like CRT/LRP ) macrophages apoptotic neutrophil . The expression partner neutrophil membrane apoptosis investigate patient diagnosis remission obtain . Research design Methods : 1 . Characterization apoptosis neutrophil GPA patient We determine apoptosis rate neutrophil whole blood . Methodology : Research perform neutrophils isolate healthy control donor obtain French Blood Institute ( Etablissement Français du Sang ) vasculitis patient Department Internal Medicine Cochin Hospital head Professor Loïc Guillevin . Apoptosis induce `` physiologicaly '' whole blood overnight incubation 37°C . Phosphatidylserine externalization measure flow cytometry annexin-V labeling associate 7-AAD staining CD15+ cell . Western blot analysis use specific antibody PCNA also use visualize expression . 2 . Analysis scramblase , PR3 , calreticulin , AnnexinA1 , expression apoptotic neutrophil GPA patient We determine membrane expression PR3 , CRT , PLSCR , AxA1 , apoptotic neutrophil different subset neutrophil : non apoptotic one ( AnnexinV- , 7AAD- ) , early apoptotic neutrophil ( AnnexinV+ , 7AAD- ) late apoptotic neutrophil ( AnnexinV+ , 7AAD+ ) . This determination do patient time diagnosis ( active state ; BVAS &gt; 3 ) remission . Methodology - Neutrophils isolate blood use Dextran gradient Ficoll . - Investigation PR3 , CRT , PLSCR , AxA1 , membrane expression measure isolated neutrophil flow cytometry overnight incubation 37°C assessment apoptosis annexin-V label 7AAD stain . 3 . Study respiratory burst neutrophil GPA patient One main function neutrophil production reactive oxygen specie , determine oxidative metabolism neutrophil due different stimulus ( f-MLP , opsonized zymosan bead complement , opsonize zymosan bead IgG , PMA ) without previous prim TNFα . Methodology : Exploration respiratory burst do whole blood chemoluminescent ( luminol ) technique . Neutrophils prim TNFα stimulate without prim . The burst response analyse 90 minute stimulation . 4 . Deregulation neutrophil Cytokinome Neutrophils capable synthetize large number cytokine ( IL-1 , TNFα , IL-6 , IL-12 ) , growth factor like GM-CSF chimiokines like IL-8 . More recently show neutrophil also great producer BAFF ( B-cell activate factor ) production superior monocyte dendritic cell stimulate INF-γ . In GPA serum BAFF level show high control recently target B-lymphocytes therapeutic confirm large control trial importance AAV . Methodology : Serum patient collect time neutrophil . They analyze use BD™ Cytometric Bead Array ( CBA ) detection IL-8 , IL-1β , IL-6 , IL-10 , TNF , IL-12p70 . Neutrophils isolate 1 ) stimulate INF-γ , LPS G-CSF analyze production secretion BAFF/BlyS determine ELISA . 5 . Deregulation neutrophil Proteome functional study new PR3 partner Gene array study show probable deregulation neutrophil AAV , study study deregulation protein level . Methodology : To study proteome GPA patient active remission compare healthy control use differential gel electrophoresis cytosolic sample neutrophil obtain sonication . Identification proteins interest do mass spectrometry MALDI-TOF-TOF . Functional validation proteins over-expression siRNA extinction perform .</detailed_description>
