Children perform flanker task know engage dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) attention task . The child also perform look picture appeal unappealing food rate whether would like eat . This task know activate ventral striatum ( VS ) ( reward processing ) . A secondary hypothesis whether child restrict diet show change activity connectivity area ( DLPFC , ACC , VS ) relative Ruse diet .</detailed_description>
