	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers interested muscle affect movement knee cap . These muscle may relate different kind knee pain caused injury disease . Imaging study magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) use look muscle . To study muscle move , researcher use MRI look healthy individual individual knee cap pain . Objectives : - To study change muscle around knee influence knee pain . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 55 year age knee cap pain explain specific injury disease . - Healthy volunteer 18 55 year age . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . - This study require two visit . Each visit use standard MRI sequence take image knee motion rest . - On first visit , MRI scan look knee natural state . Participants move knee 1 3 minute time scan . - On second visit , local anesthetic agent inject muscle thigh . The anesthetic block muscle generate force 2 3 hour . Participants move knee 1 3 minute time MRI scan .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Muscle Strength Loss Its Effect Knee Cap Motion Volunteers With Anterior Knee Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic idiopathic patellofemoral pain , potential precursor osteoarthritis , one common problem knee . It characterize anterior knee pain aggravate deep knee flexion , prolong sitting , repetitive flexion/extension . The widely accept theory regard source pain force imbalance around knee lead static patellofemoral malalignment dynamic patellofemoral maltracking . In turn , malalignment maltracking lead elevate joint contact stress , ultimately lead patellofemoral pain . Current understanding patellofemoral maltracking typically focus static 2D alignment ( lateral tilt displacement ) . Yet , patellofemoral pain often exacerbated dynamic event patella complete six degree freedom movement . More recent study able quantify patellofemoral kinematics volitional dynamic task demonstrate patellofemoral pain , alter kinematics limited excessive patellar lateral translation tilt , include excessive patellar superior translation along excessive flexion valgus rotation . Flexion valgus sagittal coronal plane rotation cause superior pole patella shift anteriorly medially , respectively . Recent work show altered force balance around knee indeed lead maltracking . However , question remain whether correct exist force imbalance around knee normalize patellar kinematics and/or reduce pain . The purpose study determine temporary iatrogenic loss force vastus lateralis muscle alters aberrant patellar kinematics subject chronic idiopathic patellofemoral pain .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Male female volunteer age 18 55 EXCLUSION CRITERIA : All Volunteers 1 . Any relevant medical problem , include 933 prevent ambulation 2 . Any serious injury joint study , previous surgery joint studiedor extreme pain joint study condition may explain presence PF_pain ( e.g. , meniscal tear , arthritis ) 3 . Allergy/hypersensitivity local anesthetic agent ( e.g. , novacaine , lidocaine , bupivacaine , ropivacaine ) 4 . Liver disease 5 . Open angle glaucoma 6 . Cardiac arrhythmia , congenital heart disease 7 . Glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency 8 . Any female pregnant A volunteer exclude contraindication MR imaging . Examples : 1 . Metal within body , might expect concentrate radiofrequency field cause tissue damage twist magnetic field ( e.g. , aneurysm clip , implanted neural stimulator , implanted cardiac pacemaker autodefibrillator , cochlear implant , foreign body ( e.g . metal shaving , insulin pump ) . 2 . A condition , would preclude participate MR image study ( e.g. , paralyzed hemidiaphragm , morbid obesity , severe claustrophobia ) 3 . A condition present unnecessary risk unborn child ( e.g. , 953 pregnancy , previous surgery uncertain type , symptom pheochromocytoma insulinoma )</criteria>
