	<brief_summary>Background : - Parkinson 's disease cause slow movement , stiffness , tremor . It get bad time , case lead dementia . Researchers interested dementia affect brain people Parkinson 's disease . They study people Parkinson disease healthy volunteer . They give test think memory , look brain activity use image study . This may provide information part brain work well people dementia relate Parkinson 's disease . Objectives : - To use imaging study see part brain work well people dementia cause Parkinson 's disease . Eligibility : - Individuals least 40 year age Parkinson disease . - Healthy volunteer least 40 year age . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . - This study require two outpatient visit 2 day . - Participants test think , memory , concentration . They answer question fill questionnaire . The test also look quickly move handle small object . The test take 3 hour . - Participants magnetic resonance imaging study brain . Functional MRI ( fMRI ) show part brain use perform task . Participants respond image computer screen fMRI . - Treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives : The purpose protocol identify neural correlate cognitive impairment Parkinson disease ( PD ) use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Study Population : We study 36 PD patient , define UK Parkinson Society Brain Bank diagnostic criterion [ 1 ] , consist 12 patient cognitively normal PD ( PD-CogNL ) , 12 PD mild cognitive impairment ( PD-MCI ) [ 2 ] , 12 PD dementia ( PDD ) [ 3 ] . We also study 12 age- gender-matched healthy volunteer ( HVs ) control . Design : This observational study include 3 PD patient subgroup ( PD-CogNL , PD-MCI PDD ) HVs group . Eligible participant one visit last 2- 4 day , ideally 2 consecutive day . If visit complete within time frame , second visit may schedule within 3 month complete assessment . They clinical assessment , cognitive assessment , MRI scan . Outcome Measures Hypothesis : The primary outcome measure Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) score functional connectivity cognitive network , include default mode network , use restingstate functional MRI ( fMRI ) . We hypothesize group difference functional connectivity cognitive network PD patient subgroup HVs . We also hypothesize correlation MMSE score functional connectivity default mode network PD patient . Secondary outcome measure fractional anisotropy ( FA ) value , functional connectivity cognitive network work memory task , olfactory function score functional connectivity olfactory network , scale brain perfusion functional connectivity default mode network . We hypothesize : 1 ) group difference FA value PD patient subgroup HVs ; 2 ) group differences functional connectivity cognitive network work memory task PD patient subgroup HVs ; 3 ) correlation olfactory function functional connectivity olfactory network patient PD-CogNL PD-MCI ; 4 ) correlation brain perfusion functional connectivity default mode network PD patient .</detailed_description>

EXCLUSION CRITERIA subject : Use illegal drug within past 6 month . More 7 alcoholic drink week female 14 alcoholic drink week male . History neurologic disorder brain tumor , stroke , central nervous system infection , multiple sclerosis , movement disorder , epilepsy history seizure , except PD PD patient . History head injury loss consciousness . Pregnancy positive pregnancy test research procedure due risk associate MRI scan . Inability lie flat back 2 hour . Claustrophobia feel discomfort small , enclosed space enough severity prevent MRI scanning . Surgically traumatically implant metallic foreign body , pacemaker , implant medical pump , implant hearing aid , metal plate skull metal implant skull eye ( dental filling ) may physically hazardous MRI , might distort image . Ablative surgery implant electrode generator deep brain stimulation Use follow medication substance within 6 month get MRI scan : e.g. , Cocaine , amphetamine , methylphenidate , ephedrine , phentermine , buproprion , fentanyl , ketamine , phencyclidine . Prescribed medication common condition , allergy cold , exclusionary . Prescribed medication PD exclusionary PD patient . Have uncontrolled head movement may impair image data collection ( PD patient ) . Subjects MMSE &lt; 26 HVs . Have clinically relevant focal neurological finding exam suggest cerebral pathology associate PD PD patient . Any abnormal focal find neurological exam HVs . Abnormal finding clinical MRI . PD patient Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) II &gt; 31 exclude , severe extreme depression may confound cognitive function .</criteria>
