Researchers look treatment may help pregnant woman area world malaria common . To , want collect blood sample pregnant woman south-central Uganda . They also collect sample newborn baby mother agrees . Objectives : - To collect biological material blood sample pregnant woman newborn . Eligibility : - Women 14 45 year age pregnant labor . - Participants Kalisizio area south-central Uganda . Design : - Women pregnant provide blood urine sample . - Women labor allow researcher collect sample baby delivery . Samples take placenta tissue umbilical cord blood . The baby also weigh measure .

	<detailed_description>Malaria cause Plasmodium falciparum continue global problem devastate consequence . Pregnancy malaria associate low birth weight , maternal anemia , gestational hypertension , inflammation fetal response infection may contribute poor outcome . Pregnancy malaria cause P. falciparum-infected erythrocyte bind placental receptor chondroitin sulfate A ( CSA ) sequester placenta , cause disease death mother offspring . Women become resistant pregnancy malaria acquire antibody target surface protein placental parasite . Malaria vaccine candidate target parasite liver stage blood stage may protect pregnant woman unborn child . The primary hypothesis study antibody raise animal recombinant pregnancy malaria vaccine candidate similar functional activity naturally acquire antibody . Up 1500 pregnant woman recruit cross sectional study conduct Rakai , Uganda . Women present delivery newborn woman present antenatal visit Kalisizo Hospital , Rakai District enrol . Samples collect woman use in-vitro assay assess functional activity antiserum raise pregnancy malaria vaccine candidate primary outcome study . For secondary outcome , examine various factor lead poor outcome low birth weight infant measure newborn birth weight physical muscular maturity use Dubowitz Ballard Exam Gestational Age . We also study effect intermittent preventive therapy pregnancy ( IPTp ) immune responses mother well effect HIV infection acquisition immunity pregnancy malaria . Clinical , parasitological host response endpoint ( include naturally acquire functional antibody CSA-binding parasite ) analyze use appropriate statistical method , include adjustment possible confounders , determine factor associate malaria infection disease pregnant woman , well pregnancy outcome .</detailed_description>
