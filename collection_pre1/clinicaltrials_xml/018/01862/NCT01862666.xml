	<brief_summary>Barrett 's esophagus ( BE ) pre-neoplastic condition form metaplasia normal squamous mucosa distal esophagus specialize intestinal mucosa . Its development mostly associate chronic injury gastroesophageal reflux . BE widely consider lead risk factor development esophageal adenocarcinoma ( EAC ) . Volumetric laser endomicroscopy ( VLE ) think analogous technique ultrasound , however , instead produce image scatter sound wave , utilizes optical scattering base difference tissue composition form two-dimensional image . The benefit VLE ultrasound capable generate cross-sectional image tissue axial-resolution 10 micrometer , comparable low-power microscopy . The propose trial evaluate ability physician use VLE visualize high grade intraepithelial neoplasia ( HGIN ) intramucosal adenocarcinoma ( IMC ) ex-vivo in-vivo setting correlate image standard histology endoscopic mucosal resection specimen gold standard .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Volumetric Laser Endomicroscopy ( VLE ) Endoscopic Mucosal Resection ( EMR ) Patients With Barrett 's Dysplasia Intramucosal Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The diagnosis dysplasia early adenocarcinoma BE remain challenge . At present , endoscopy biopsy suspect BE lesion available method . However , endoscopic recognition early dysplasia BE rely subjective visual recognition endoscopist . The subtle mucosal variation early dysplastic change esophagus may easily miss . The development wide-field , high resolution endoscopic microscopy could enhance early detection treatment dysplasia BE .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Males female age 18 year . Patients either suspect confirm Barrett'sassociated dysplasia intramucosal adenocarcinoma present endoscopy likely require EMR . Only enbloc resection investigate , require lesion maximum diameter 15 mm Paris classification 0IIa , b , c , combination . Ability provide write , informed consent . Women childbearing potential must willing take pregnancy test . Patients anticoagulation . Patients esophageal varix preclude either mucosal resection biopsy . Presence esophageal mass precludes full distention balloon NvisionVLE Catheter . Patients esophageal stricture would prevent adequate expansion balloon NvisionVLE Catheter . Patients know inflammatory disease , esophageal tear ulcer , would prohibit full distention balloon NvisionVLE Catheter . Patients know eosinophilic esophagitis . Patients pregnant . Patients history hemostasis disorders* . Patients esophagitis grade A. Hemostasis disorder include , limited : patient hemophilia congenitally acquire clot factor deficiency , patient cirrhosis coagulopathy , patient know thrombocytopenia ( &lt; 100,000 plt/ul ) individual von Willibrand 's disease know platelet malfunction disorder .</criteria>
