	<brief_summary>The functional , social , economic burden chronic obstructive lung disease ( COPD ) healthcare system extraordinary . COPD fourth lead cause death United States , estimate attribute $ 33.2 billion health care cost COPD-associated morbidity mortality annually . The burden COPD VA Healthcare system parallels finding . According VA HSR &amp; D Health Economics Resource Center , COPD rank 5th among 40 common chronic clinical condition U.S . Veteran patient population , responsible &gt; 14,000 VA hospital admission annually , increase $ 1,051/patient total annual health care cost burden VA Healthcare system . Importantly , COPD associate frequent emergency room visitation and/or hospitalization patient . Pulmonary hypertension common co-morbid condition worsen morbidity mortality patient COPD . This study examine potential tadalafil , phosphodiesterase type-5 ( PDE-5 ) inhibitor improve functional status decrease pulmonary hypertension . Results study expect define potential use PDE-5 inhibitor COPD-induced pulmonary hypertension .

	<detailed_description>Project Summary/Abstract This VA CSR &amp; D Merit Review Award Clinical Trial proposal describe 5-year program support prospective , placebo-controlled , randomized clinical trial ( RCT ) evaluate effect phosphodiesterase type-5 ( PDE-5 ) inhibition tadalafil 40 mg daily 12 month exercise capacity patient least moderate pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) PH ( mean pulmonary artery pressure ( mPAP ) &gt; 30 mm Hg , pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) &gt; 3.0 Woods unit , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure ( PCWP ) &lt; 18 mm Hg ) due chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) GOLD stage II high , FEV1FVC &lt; 70 FEV1 &lt; 79 % ) . PDE-5 inhibitor recommend World Health Organization ( WHO ) Category 1 PH evidence base recommendation support use inhibitor COPD-induced PH ( WHO Category 3 ) . In order ensure maximum patient enrollment increase clinical demographic diversity patient include study , propose research conduct four VA site : Boston VA Healthcare System , Providence VA Medical Center , Greater Los Angeles VA Healthcare System Atlanta VA . The research team include senior investigator extensive experience clinical management patient COPD PH . The principal investigator ( PI ) study Dr. Ronald H. Goldstein ( Chief , Pulmonary Medicine Boston Healthcare System ) Dr Sharon Rounds ( Chief , Medical Service , Providence VA ) . Dr Shelley Shapiro serve site PI Greater Los Angeles VA Healthcare System . Within Veteran population , COPD rank among common chronic disease inflict substantial clinical economic burden VA Healthcare System . Importantly , vast majority COPD-associated mortality morbidity , include hospital admission , derive relatively select subpopulation patient . There emerge evidence suggest clinically evident PH key determinate risk COPD exacerbation progression disease . The investigator find moderate severe PH associate significantly increase rate COPD-related hospital readmission compare similar Veterans COPD mild PH . Moreover , trend influence difference conventional measure COPD disease severity ( i.e. , force expiratory volume 1 second [ FEV1 ] ) irrespective supplemental oxygen status . These observation support previously establish clinical observation others demonstrate traditional COPD therapy , include supplemental oxygen , ineffective modulating sustain improvement cardiopulmonary hemodynamics patient COPD PH . It establish specific form PH hypoxia central mediator disease progression restoration NO -- dependent signal pulmonary vascular tissue effective attenuate pulmonary vascular remodel improve cardiopulmonary hemodynamics , exercise tolerance , quality life . The extent therapy preserve NO -- dependent signal pulmonary vascular tissue effective PH due chronic lung disease , however , know . Under physiological condition , enzyme phosphodiesterase type-5 ( PDE-5 ) function maintain pulmonary vascular tone degrade cGMP , key signal intermediary involve NO -- dependent signaling . However , PH due lung disease , pulmonary vascular level NO- diminish PDE-5 level increase . This raise possibility PDE-5 inhibition potential strategy increase NO- bioavailability attenuate PH patient COPD , set framework central hypothesis current proposal pharmacological inhibition PDE-5 improve functional capacity assess 6 minute walk test patient COPD-induced moderate severe PH . The secondary outcome measure ass whether change functional status accompany improvement maximal oxygen uptake cardiopulmonary testing ( VO2 ) change vascular remodel assessed cardiopulmonary hemodynamics . To test hypothesis , RCT conduct use tadalafil ( 40 mg orally daily ) placebo . The primary outcome measurement six minute walk test . The secondary outcome measure functional assessment use peak volume oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) hemodynamic measure PVR mPAP . Additional information obtain related non-invasive assessment pulmonary artery systolic pressure right ventricular ( RV ) function include tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion , pulmonary artery acceleration time , change pulmonary outflow tract Doppler envelope , dyspnea , health relate quality life assess validated standardized questionnaire frequency COPD exacerbation 12 month . Results study expect define potential use PDE-5 inhibitor COPD-induced PH . If successful , treatment option may improve quality life outcomes large number Veterans afflict PH due COPD .</detailed_description>
