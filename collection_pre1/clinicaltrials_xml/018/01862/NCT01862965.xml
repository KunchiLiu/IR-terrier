	<brief_title>Treatment Newly Diagnosed Moderate Severe Chronic Graft-versus-host Disease With Prednisone Everolimus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background 2.1 Chronic graft-versus-host disease Chronic graft-versus-host disease ( cGvHD ) common long-term complication allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo-HSCT ) , incidence 70 % recipient peripheral blood stem cell . Chronic GvHD associate impaired immunity , compromise functional status quality life besides relapse underlie malignancy still lead cause morbidity mortality beyond day 100 allo-HSCT . The pathophysiology cGvHD still well understood , however effort make last year indicate role persistent allo-reactive T cell , B cell produce auto- allo-antibodies host antigen well donor antigen present cell ( APC ) replace host APCs thus lead indirect antigen presentation allo-antigens . Persistent alloreactivity may due defective peripheral central tolerance mechanism result failure control regulatory T cell ( Tregs ) and/or impaired negative selection T cell thymus . Corticosteroids constitute backbone treatment cGvHD past 4 decade . Addition calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI ) steroids first-line therapy lead significant improvement response patient outcome . The expand therapeutic arsenal cGvHD also include many agent evaluate second-line therapy mTOR inhibitor , extracorporeal photopheresis , mycophenolate mofetil , rituximab , alemtuzumab , thalidomide , imatinib , pentostatin , low dose methotrexate amongst others . The median duration immunosuppression 23 month high 3 year non-relapse mortality 40 % emphasize urgent need new first line treatment strategy . 3 Study rationale The outcome patient chronic GvHDcGvHD treat corticosteroid alone combination CNI like CSA tacrolimus still unsatisfactory increase relative risk non-relapse mortality 7 time compare patient without mild cGvHD . While corticosteroid generally accept backbone systemic therapy , role CNI remain questionable . There thus urgent need improvement first-line treatment patient . mTOR inhibitor like sirolimus ( rapamycin ) everolimus show effective second-line treatment cGvHD . In light data give unmet medical need treatment cGvHD , rationale examine efficacy mTOR inhibitor first line treatment patient cGvHD . 4 Hypothesis study objectives The primary hypothesis study addition everolimus prednisone increase response rate without increase ofincreasing non-relapse relapse mortality . In contrast CNI , everolimus may also facilitate development tolerance thereby improve durability response , thus increase time treatment failure . 4.1 General objectives The main objective study investigate clinical benefit treatment prednisone everolimus patient chronic GvHDcGvHD . Treatment change time flare-up cGvHD symptom show correlate survival patient cGvHD . In study addition secondary treatment reflect treatment failure serve parameter measure clinical benefit . 6.3 Discussion study design Chronic GvHD occur 50 % patient allogeneic HSCT , 80 % moderate severe disease require systemic therapy . The participation 6 centre enable recruitment 60 patient within 24 month . The follow-up period 1 year sufficient evaluate time progression , show predict survival . There control group . The finding study analyse discussed light historical data lay groundwork possible randomize study . The German-Swiss-Austrian GvHD-group run registry prospectively document cGvHD case , treatment outcome 2012 . The control population consist patient treat cGvHD registry within time period study . A comparison historical population treat placebo arm impact Myfortic® first line treatment cGvHD [ Martin et al.,2009 ] also perform . 7.4 Sample size estimation The sample size estimation base data placebo arm randomize trial lead Paul Martin evaluate impact additional MMF initial treatment cGvHD [ data kindly provide Paul Martin ] . The rate treatment success 6 month placebo arm study ( standard treatment prednisone alone prednisone plus calcineurin inhibitor ) 62 % . Assuming treatment success rate 65 % patient receive standard therapy ( steroids alone steroids calcineurin inhibitor ) test whether combination prednisone everolimus would improve rate treatment success 85 % , 80 % power one-sided type error ( α ) 5 % , least 57 patient need recruit . This study thus plan recruit total 60 patient . This patient number enable comparison patient treated period within plan cGvHD registry well historic comparison data mention study lead Paul Martin . 8 Diagnosis grade cGvHD 8.1 Overview Diagnosis grade cGvHD accord NIH consensus-criteria . If diagnosis cGvHD depend skin manifestation , assessment biopsy organize site accord local routine . A central review recommend obligatory . 8.2 Definition high-risk cGvHD High risk cGvHD define one follow criterion fulfil time diagnosis cGvHD : - &lt; 100,000/µl platelet - progressive onset cGvHD ( see 7.2.1 definition ) - involvement &gt; 50 % total body surface area - bilirubin &gt; 2 mg/dl - bronchiolitis obliterans 8.2.1 Definition progressive onset cGvHD Progressive onset cGvHD define acute GvHD precede cGvHD whereby either 1. complete response ( CR ) acute GvHD attain onset cGvHD 2. time CR aGvHD onset symptom cGvHD less 2 week . 9.3 GvHD prophylaxis acute GvHD therapy 9.3.1 GvHD prophylaxis Any kind GvHD prophylaxis may use , include mTOR-containing regimen . Type GvHD prophylaxis document included analysis . 9.3.2 Acute GvHD therapy Any kind acute GvHD therapy may use , exclude mTOR inhibitor ( everolimus sirolimus ) . 9.3.3 Conditioning regimen stem cell source - Any kind conditioning regimen ( myeloablative reduce intensity ) may use transplantation - Stem cell source may bone marrow , peripheral blood stem cell cord blood - Donors may relate unrelated , match mismatch Conditioning intensity , stem cell source donor type donor/recipient histocompatibility document include analysis . 9.6 Patients ' evaluation 9.6.1 Assessment pre-registration characteristic Prior enrolment study patient examine inclusion exclusion criterion . A comprehensive assessment organ involvement shall perform accord NIH consensus criterion . The time examination initiation study treatment maximum 14 day . 9.7 Study monitor 9.7.1 Clinical assessment visit Regular clinical assessment visit plan include patient 's physical examination , blood count , blood chemistry everolimus level . 9.7.2 Response assessment visit Response treatment assess 2 week , month 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 initiation treatment , introduction secondary treatment case premature study withdrawal . Response assessment perform prospectively describe publication Martin et al . retrospectively accord NIH consensus recommendation . 9.7.3 End study assessment visit Patients go protocol regularly ( complete response max . 1 year treatment ) prematurely undergo response assessment outline section 8.7.2 . 11 Treatment plan 11.1 Overview After diagnosis cGvHD patient receive prednisone 1 mg/kg BW orally everolimus ( whole tablet dispersible tablet ) orally ( target trough level 3-8 µg/l ) . Prednisone may also administer intravenously 1 mg/kg patient unable take oral formulation . Patients treat protocol maximum 12 month . Patients still respond continue treatment protocol discretion local physician . Patients followed-up another 12 month end protocol treatment . 11.2 Regular dose taper immunosuppressive drug 11.2.1 Stopping prior calcineurin inhibitor If patient calcineurin inhibitor time study inclusion , CNI taper stop within 1-3 week initiation study treatment , initial reduction 50 % initiation everolimus . The CNI baseline level high 100 µg/ml CSA high 6 µg/ml tacrolimus start everolimus . 11.2.2 Stopping prior mTOR inhibitor If patient sirolimus everolimus prophylaxis time study inclusion , everolimus continue ; sirolimus switch everolimus without taper load . 11.2.3 Dosing recommend taper steroid The initial dose prednisone 1 mg/kg BW give single dose morning . It recommend maintain dose least 2 week taper depend patient 's response ( CR PR ) , accord appendix 13.1 13.2 . These taper recommendation mean guide taper speed . Patients progressive disease 2 week ( &gt; 25 % organ ) consider steroid-refractory require secondary therapy . 11.2.4 Dosing taper everolimus The initial dose everolimus 0.75 mg twice daily . The dose shall adjust target trough serum level 3-8 µg/l , measure HPLC immunoassay 4 5 day previous dose change . Initial dose reduction may consider presence co-medication interfere metabolism everolimus ( see also 10.3.7 . ) Dose adjustment shall accord clinical judgement local physician take consideration toxicity , serum level concomitant medication . Since CNI ( particularly CSA ) interact everolimus , trough level everolimus need readjust stop CNI . In patient abnormal liver function test initial dose everolimus 0.25 mg twice daily ( see Appendix 13.5.5 ) . Increment daily dose surpass 0.5 mg within 1 week initial monitoring everolimus level twice weekly stable level attain 2 week . This close monitoring repeat case dose modification . In patient develop abnormal liver function ( ) already treatment everolimus , serum level drug also need monitor closely ( twice weekly ) , least 2 week emergence abnormal liver function enable prompt dose modification require . After discontinuation prednisone , patient monitor least 4 week possible recurrence cGvHD symptom . In absence cGvHD activity , everolimus taper period 12 24 week discretion local physician . 11.2.5 Concomitant therapy Additional treatment topical immunosuppressant like steroid consider treatment failure give discretion local physician . Addition secondary systemic immunosuppressive therapy consider treatment failure outline 4.1 . Prophylaxis infection , red blood cell platelet support antithrombotic prophylaxis give accord institutional practice . Monitoring cytomegalovirus reactivation preemptive therapy antiviral agent perform accord centre ' policy . Documentation adverse event concomitant medication patient perform time patient sign inform consent form patient completes , withdraws withdraw study . 11.3 Management toxicity dose modification 11.3.1 Toxicity evaluation Toxicity monitor least every month . Monitoring include physical examination , laboratory liver kidney function test , blood lipid blood count . 11.3.2 Management hyperlipidaemia Patients hyperlipidemia advise maintain diet . They also receive HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor fibrates . However caution must take patient monitor development rhabdomyolysis . Everolimus continue treatment hyperlipidaemia unless lipid level uncontrollable standard therapy . Dose modification everolimus hyperlipidaemia diet appropriate treatment HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor fibrates accord appendix 13.5.3 11.3.3 Management TMA TMA shall document report immediately . In event TMA , everolimus shall discontinue . Plasmapheresis may use discretion manage physician . Prevention TMA involve avoid drug level target range . High drug level prompt close monitoring hematocrit , platelet , LDH , BUN , creatinine schistocytes . 11.3.4 Management hematotoxicity Patients severe cGvHD often cytopenia . Cytopenia may also cause concomitant medication like antiviral drug antibiotic cGvHD . Dose modification everolimus therefore take baseline platelet count consideration . Absolute neutrophile count ( ANC ) , hematocrit platelet count shall monitor regularly . If cause cytopenia rule , everolimus dose modify accord appendix 13.5.4 . GCSF , blood platelet transfusion may give discretion local physician . 11.3.5 Management non-infectious pneumonitis ( NIP ) Symptoms NIP usually subside completely within one month cessation treatment . This reversibility enable differentiation BOOP . The incidence outcome NIP document assessed study . Treatment everolimus restart diagnosis NIP . 11.3.6 Management toxicity Patients also monitor toxicity edema , arthralgias aphthous ulcer . Efforts make rule cause . If cause toxicity rule toxicity thought cause everolimus significant , everolimus dose decrease 50 % . If symptom improve resolve 2 week , everolimus hold . If symptom improve resolve , everolimus restart 50 % gradually increase full dose tolerate . Everolimus hold maximum 14 successive day patient remain study , longer treatment break mean premature termination study treatment . 11.3.7 Other important consideration Serum level everolimus significantly influence food intake , thus everolimus take consistent time day consistently without food minimize variability . In appendix 13.5.1 13.5.2 drug list know interact everolimus and/or prednisone . During concomitant medication drug , caution take patient see , least weekly every two week order closely monitor drug level perform clinical examination toxicity . Concomitant treatment recommend administer deem absolutely necessary . Grapefruit juice St. John 's Wort must take treatment everolimus . Concomitant treatment voriconazole recommend avoid . If use voriconazole deem absolutely clinically necessary , dose reduction everolimus 90 % may necessary . Concomitant treatment azoles like fluconazole posaconazole also require caution include close monitoring everolimus serum level dose adjustment . Concomitant treatment atorvastatin , pravastatin HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor fibrates require monitor patient sign rhabdomyolysis everolimus level . Patients receive Ciclosporin tacrolimus taper stop describe chapter 10.2.1 . Everolimus dose adjust thereafter accord serum level .</detailed_description>
