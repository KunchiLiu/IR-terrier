	<brief_summary>Infiltration ( inject next tooth ) injection common dentistry number study show articaine anesthetic , injected next low molar , effective local anesthetic injection lidocaine . However success rate high hop . No objective study address success rate buffer articaine mandibular primary buccal infiltration first molar . Therefore , purpose prospective , randomize , double-blind , crossover study compare degree pulpal anesthesia obtain buffer 4 % articaine 1:100,000 epinephrine solution versus non-buffered 4 % articaine 1:100,000 epinephrine solution primary infiltration mandibular first molar . The investigator also record pain injection postoperative pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Testing Anesthetic Effectiveness Buffered Articaine Injected Next Lower First Molar .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Using crossover design , 80 adult subject receive two injection consist primary mandibular first molar infiltration 1.8 mL non-buffered 4 % articaine 1:100,000 epinephrine , 1.8 mL buffer 4 % articaine 1:100,000 two separate appointment space least one week apart . With crossover design , 160 infiltration give first molar subject serve control . Eighty infiltration administer mandibular leave side 80 administer mandibular right side . The order two injection assign randomly dentist subject blind anesthetic subject give . The anesthetic use study experimental . An electric pulp tester ( EPT ) use test lower first molar anesthesia start 30 second injection ; test every 30 second first five minute . After five minute EPT use test low first molar every minute contralateral control canine every 5 minute grand total sixty minute . The pain injection postoperative pain record survey . Patients report postoperative pain discomfort Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) three day follow appointment . The data statistically analyze .</detailed_description>
