	<brief_summary>Background : - Normal bacteria tiny organism ( microbiota ) live mouth nose . They contribute human health many way , include digest food balance hormone . Testing sample mouth show microbiotas relate health disease . However , microbiota person 's mouth differs depend method collection part mouth test . Understanding change microbiota ( include mouth site , person eats smoke ) give information study oral microbiota smoking-related cancer disease . Objectives : - To see smoke affect microbiotas mouth nose . - To determine collection method mouth specimen use study microbiota . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age use tobacco product regularly least 5 year . - Individuals least 18 year age never smoke . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . - Participants dental exam . They provide saliva sample . The dentist take swab inside mouth , include tongue , tonsil , gum , teeth . The inside nose also swab . - Participants also fill questionnaire . It ask history smoking consumption alcohol , tea , coffee . It also ask current medication , include antibiotic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The oral microbial community ( microbiota ) , centrally related nutrition , metabolism , immunity , inflammation , endocrine balance . Cigarette smoking associate serious health outcome include cancer , cardiovascular disease chronic lung disease . However , little know relationship cigarette smoking , oral microbiota tobacco-related health outcome . Microbiotas different site oral cavity vary widely . Recent study indicate difference microbial profile buccal mucosa gingival plaque distinct difference tongue stool . To date , knowledge effect smoke oral microbiotas lack . As initial step toward understand role oral microbiota smoking-related health outcome , propose pilot study evaluate effect cigarette smoke microbiotas buccal rinse obtain oral cavity across 8 different oral cavity sites/niches ( saliva , swabs tongue dorsum , hard palate , buccal mucosa , keratinize gingiva , palatine tonsil , supragingival plaque , subgingival plaque ) . We seek recruit 50 volunteer Eastman Dental General Dentistry Clinic , Rochester , NY , include 25 current smoker &gt; 5 year smoke history 25 never smoker comparison group . Age-group , gender , race ( Caucasian/African- American ) match two group . In subject , buccal cell ( mouthwash ) collection collect accord PLCO buccal cell collection protocol . In addition , collection across 8 different oral cavity sit do use protocol develop Human Microbiome Project . These 9 collection use high throughput sequence 16S rRNA microbial gene Institute Genome Sciences , University Maryland School Medicine . The finding provide information effect smoke microbial taxon composition relative abundance collection site . This pilot study demonstrate effect smoke oral microbiotas across different oral cavity site also demonstrate oral collection site promise detailed study cigarette smoke oral microbiota . In addition , data collect provide validation framework use PLCO buccal specimen large-scale study . The information validity use PLCO buccal cell collection invaluable asset large scale study microbiota cancer risk . We also able investigate taxonomy microbial diversity difference heavy smoker never-smokers . This pilot study provide essential information collection , design analysis enable study relationships cigarette smoking , oral microbiome tobacco-related cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA This study recruit convenience sample 50 volunteer ( 25 current smoker least 5 year smoke history , 25 never smoker ) . Current smoker define individual smoke 100 cigarette lifetime smoke 5 cigarette last 24 hour . Recent use tobacco product ( pipe , cigar , snuff , cigarillo , chew tobacco ) overall exclusion , use remote past ( &gt; 6 month ago ) acceptable smoker . Never smoker define individual never smoke cigarette use tobacco product include pipe , cigar , snuff , cigarillo , chew tobacco . The ethnic mix clinic roughly 50 % Caucasians 50 % African Americans small number unspecified racial group . The median age 50 gender mix consist equal number men woman . We therefore select smoker frequency match nonsmoker base ethnicity ( White , AfricanAmerican ) , gender ( male , female ) , age ( median , estimate 50 ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA We exclude pregnant woman racial group may represent small number thus difficult match . Hormonal change associate pregnancy unique cultural habit associate specific ethnic group could associate highly unique variable microbiome pattern , therefore reduce power detect difference associate smoke primary goal . We also exclude subject antibiotic usage last three month subject previous diagnosed major periodontal disease cancer might potential confounders .</criteria>
