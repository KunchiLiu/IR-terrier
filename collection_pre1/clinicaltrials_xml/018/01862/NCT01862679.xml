	<brief_summary>The common form renal replacement therapy currently use high flux haemodialysis ( HF-HD ) haemodiafiltration ( HDF ) . Although technique appear similar patient , important difference happen blood travel dialysis machine . During HDF , machine control hydrostatic pressure across dialyser remove additional water together toxins blood fluid volume continually replace ultra-pure solution . HDF theoretical advantage remove waste substance , especially large molecule , blood HF-HD may benefit patient medium long term.Despite theoretical advantage , trial far unable find significant difference death rate development health problem among patient HDF HF-HD . It therefore important examine factor may help doctor patient decide treatment use . The investigator design study aim answer three main question : 1 . Does HDF make patient feel well ? 2 . Is blood pressure stable HDF comparison HF-HD ? 3 . Are Phosphate level blood parameter well control HDF HF-HD ? The investigator randomly assign patient HF-HD receive 2 month either HF-HD HDF equivalent treatment prescription possible without patient know treatment receiving . After two month patient switch alternative form dialysis two month . During study investigator ask patient long take recover precede session dialysis , assess frequency symptomatic low blood pressure also perform blood test set interval measure specific blood parameter .</brief_summary>
