	<brief_summary>Background : - Roflumilast drug use treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . It design help reduce lung inflammation . However , test , roflumilast also appear reduce high blood sugar level people COPD type 2 diabetes . Other test show roflumilast also improve blood sugar level people type 2 diabetes . Researchers want see roflumilast affect insulin blood sugar level overweight obese people diabetic , high blood sugar level . Objectives : - To see well roflumilast improves blood sugar insulin level prediabetic overweight obese individual . Eligibility : - Individuals 30 65 year old overweight obese ( body mass index 24.9 39.9 kg/m2 ) elevate blood sugar level . Design : - This study last approximately 8 week . Participants approximately five study visit 7 week . Two visit overnight inpatient stay . - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . They also 3-day diet exercise assessment dietitian . - In Week 1 , participant special diet 2 day keep regular weight . They 2-day inpatient stay . During stay , multiple test , include blood sugar test full body scan . They may provide fat muscle tissue biopsy sample . They receive study drug take study . - In Week 2 , participant repeat diet study screen visit . They receive different dose study drug . - In Week 3 , participant review diet result blood urine test . - In Week 5 , participant repeat diet exercise study screen visit . - In Week 6 , participant repeat inpatient study test Week 1 . In last week , participant final follow-up visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Resveratrol , polyphenol notably find red wine anti-aging property mice feed high-fat diet ; resveratrol protect obesity type 2 diabetes . Several clinical trial conduct study metabolic effect resveratrol . Although trial use different subject group ( e.g . obese healthy , type 2 diabetic old adult glucose intolerance ) , suggest resveratrol may improve insulin sensitivity . However , therapeutic potential resveratrol diminish fact promiscuous target profile . In order translate resveratrol biology clinical application , helpful identify cellular target ( ) resveratrol mediate desire effect develop therapy specific target ( ) . Recently , discover metabolic effect resveratrol appear result competitive inhibition cAMP-degrading phosphodiesterases ( PDEs ) , increase cAMP level . The cAMP-dependent pathway activate AMP-activated protein kinase ( AMPK ) , essential metabolic effect resveratrol . Inhibiting PDE4 rolipram reproduce metabolic benefit resveratrol , include protection diet-induced obesity increase mitochondrial content , fat oxidation , physical stamen glucose tolerance mouse . Based result cellular preclinical study , hypothesize PDE4 inhibition ameliorate insulin resistance pre-diabetic individual . To test hypothesis , conduct exploratory study potential beneficial effect roflumilast ( Daxas ( Registered Trademark ) ) , PDE4 inhibitor , insulin sensitivity pre-diabetic individuals.Each study participant receive oral roflumilast ( 250 ( micro ) g , day 2 week , follow 500 ( micro ) g day 4 week ) . At baseline 6-week treatment period , assess insulin sensitivity ( hyperinsulinemiceuglycemic glucose clamp technique , glucose clamp ) . In addition , Beta-cell function , skeletal muscle mitochondrial function , body composition , circulate adipocytokine profile measure baseline treatment evaluate potential change may relate improvement metabolic function . Vascular function indicator insulin sensitivity , also important glucose delivery metabolism . If possible , vascular function assess along parameter baseline treatment roflumilast . Regarding vascular function , may measure basal insulin-stimulated brachial artery blood flow ( large conduit artery assess Doppler ultrasound ) well capillary recruitment forearm skeletal muscle ( small nutritive arteriole assess ultrasound microbubble contrast ) . This study explore whether roflumilast effective improve insulin sensitivity pre-diabetic individual . Results study may important implication potential use roflumilast treat type 2 diabetes .</detailed_description>
