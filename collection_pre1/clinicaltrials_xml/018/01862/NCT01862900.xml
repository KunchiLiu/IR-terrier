	<brief_summary>This study test investigational antibody , MEDI6469 ( anti-OX40 ) , combination stereotactic body radiation breast cancer patient liver lung metastasis receive systemic therapy progressive disease . The investigator hypothesize SBRT direct metastatic breast cancer lesion result systemic anti-tumor immune system response . This amplify direct immune response could result anti-tumor response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiation Monoclonal Antibody OX40 ( MEDI6469 ) Breast Cancer Patients With Metastatic Lesions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive one three different dos SBRT depend cohort . The dos : Cohort 1 : 15 Gy ( central tumor 10 Gy ) ; Cohort 2 : 20 Gy ( central tumor 15 Gy ) ; Cohort 3 : 20 Gy x 2 ( central tumor 15 Gy x 2 ) . In addition , patient receive three dos MEDI6469 . MEDI6469 administer 0.4 mg/kg IV 60 minute use in-line filter Days 1 , 3 , 5 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm breast cancer clinical evidence stage 4 disease Measurable disease least one lesion either liver lung amenable stereotactic body radiation One site disease receive radiation Patients hormone receptor positive breast cancer must receive prior antihormonal therapy metastatic disease progress patient hormone receptor negative breast cancer must receive least one prior chemotherapy regimen progress . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 , 1 , 2 . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test day treatment start must avoid become pregnant treatment . Men must avoid father child treatment . Patients must blood test result within prespecified range No active bleeding No clinical coagulopathy ( INR &lt; 1.5 , PT &lt; 16 second , PTT &lt; 38 second ) within 28 day Anticipated lifespan great 12 week Active infection require systemic antibiotic . Active autoimmune disease define autoimmune disease assessment tool . Previous treatment mouse monoclonal antibody At least 28 day since prior chemotherapy monoclonal antibody therapy ( trastuzumab bevacizumab ) . Patients hormonal therapy continue therapy discretion investigator . Bisphosphonate therapy acceptable study participation . Diagnosis solid tumor malignancy ( exclude nonmelanoma skin cancer ) within 3 year enrollment . Need chronic maintenance oral steroid . Active brain metastatic disease . Treated brain metastasis surgery , gammaknife radiosurgery radiation stable least 4 week steroid eligible . No metastatic site amenable SBRT Pregnant lactate woman , treatment involve risk embryo fetus . Other medical psychiatric condition opinion Principal Investigator would preclude safe participation protocol .</criteria>
