	<brief_summary>Background : - Some people obese may decrease muscle strength . They may great muscle mass show scan , show poor result exercise test . Poor muscle strength might cause difficulty exercise performance . Researchers want test muscle strength arm legs overweight woman . They also see insulin resistance affect muscle strength woman . Objectives : - To test muscle strength overweight woman . - To see insulin resistance affect muscle strength . Eligibility : - Women least 18 year age overweight ( body mass index great 25 kg/m2 ) . Design : - Participants ask fast initial blood test measure glucose insulin level . - On different day , strength testing . The first test measure leg muscle strength test quadriceps hamstring . The second test measure arm muscle strength test biceps triceps . The final test measure hand muscle ( grip ) strength . - All test take hour .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Strength Testing Overweight Women With Without Insulin Resistance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We observe protocol ( 08-H-0108 : Effects Worksite Wellness Interventions Vascular Function , Insulin Sensitivity High-Density Lipoprotein Overweight Obese Women ) despite increase lean ( muscle ) mass extremity measure dual x-ray absorptiometry , obese woman poorer exercise tolerance overweight woman less muscle mass.1 Exercise testing , however , integrate function cardiopulmonary capacity , addition muscle strength endurance . We propose determine whether muscle strength elbow flexor knee extensor muscle group correlate muscle mass group overweight obese woman select normal abnormal insulin sensitivity . Our hypothesis subject impaired insulin sensitivity high insulin level great muscle mass lower muscle strength subject normal insulin sensitivity normal insulin level . This feasibility study conduct 10 non-diabetic woman ( 5 insulin resistance , 5 normal insulin sensitivity ) previously participate 08-H-0108 , outcome provide data planning large study muscle mass strength may important achieve exercise goal important successful weight loss .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Nondiabetic female employee NIH participate protocol 08H0108 underwent insulin sensitivity test also protocol 02H0050 muscle mass determination . BP &lt; 140/90 mmHg ( medication allow ) Subject understands protocol provide write , informed consent . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Medical surgical condition would prohibit upper low extremity strength test ( e.g. , painful arthritis , prior knee elbow surgery ) Infection injury hand , knee elbow require medical attention within 3 month test</criteria>
