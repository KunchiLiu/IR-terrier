	<brief_summary>Thoracic spine thrust manipulation ( TSM ) show effective intervention management patient neck pain . However mechanisms pain relief associate intervention remain largely unexplained . Recent evidence suggest structure within brain may role create response pain relief . This study aim use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) determine change blood flow structure within brain follow TSM patient neck pain . All patient undergo fMRI receive painful stimulus direct two separate site , cuticle index finger great toe . Subjects receive either TSM sham-manipulation immediately undergo second fMRI scan receive painful stimulus . The primary outcome interest shift blood flow within brain TSM sham manipulation measure Blood Oxygen Level Dependent ( BOLD ) technology . This study first examine type response manual therapy within brain patient neck pain .</brief_summary>
