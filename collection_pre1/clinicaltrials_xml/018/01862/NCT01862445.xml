	<brief_title>Retrospective Study : Efficacy Safety Chlorambucil + Rituximab CLL Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Illness : treatment overview Chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( B-CLL ) prevalent adult leukemia among western country ( 6.7 % Non-Hodgkin Lymphomas- NHL ) . The incidence rate 2-6 case per 100.000 person per year increase age reach incidence rate 13/100.000 65 year , median age onset disease . There two clinical stag system currently use CLL ( Rai Binet stag system ) allow rough division patient three prognostic group : good , intermediate poor prognosis . The clinical course range indolent behaviour ( Rai 0 , Binet A ) long term survival aggressive disease median survival 2 year ( Rai III IV , Binet C ) . There non survival benefit associate early therapy ( Binet stage A B ) . Treatment usually initiate patient progress advance stage ( Binet stage C ) and/or become symptomatic ( fever , night sweat , weight loss ) . Purine-analogues base chemo-immunotherapy regimen consider standard care fit patient B-CLL ( Fludarabine-Cyclophosphamyde-Rituximab , FCR regimen ) . But age host biological feature disease critical issue choice therapy . The FCR regimen result significant myelosuppression high rate early late infection , especially elderly patient B-CLL , suggest may toxic therefore unsuitable large subpopulation elderly comorbid patient affect B-CLL/SLL . Rationale Chlorambucil , alkylating agent , standard first line treatment B-CLL/SLL development purine analogue monoclonal antibody . Later , phase III trial show improved ORR prolongation PFS fludarabine alone . A improvement obtain addition Cyclophosphamide Fludarabine . Eventually , Fludarabine combination Cyclophosphamide monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody Rituximab become standard first line therapy CLL patient 18 65 year old . At time , FCR regimen show significant rate early toxicity consist myelosuppression infection also high rate late infection . Data show Hallek et al report rate grade 3-4 hematological toxicity total infection 56 % 25 % , respectively . They report 8 treatment-related death ( 2 % ) , five due infection 4 death occur 3th cycle . Also report Tam et al risk 10 % late infection first year remission FCR treatment . Low-dose FCR evaluate alternative option show low rate neutropenia , without reduction response rate . Nevertheless , demonstrate reduce PFS evaluate elderly medically unfit population . Alternative treatment ( i.e. , low-dose fludarabine , low-dose fludarabine plus cyclophosphamide , rituximab alone ) explore phase II trial elderly and/or medically unfit patient CLL . Since cohort size small , however , definitive recommendation could make clinical practice . About three-quarters CLL patient 65 year old . Data CLL 5 phase III trial GCLLSG ( German CLL study group ) compare fludarabine v Chlorambucil set patient ( median age 70 year , range 65-80 year ) display difference OS PFR Fludarabine Chl , despite great percentage CR ORR Fludarabine . This suggest elderly B-CLL patient , Fludarabine alone represent major benefit respect Chl front-line therapy . However , rate complete response ( CR ) front-line Chlorambucil single agent relatively low ( 7 % ) overall response ( approximately 65 % ) . Phase II trial ongoing investigate efficacy safety Rituximab combination Chl previously untreated patient affected B-CLL .</detailed_description>
