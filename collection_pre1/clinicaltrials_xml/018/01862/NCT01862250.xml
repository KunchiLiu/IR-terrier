	<brief_summary>This research do find safety investigational study drug , clonidine , infant undergoing whole body cool treatment hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy ( HIE ) . HIE damage occur cell central nervous system ( brain spinal cord ) result decrease oxygen supply blood flow fetus due perinatal asphyxia ( inadequate oxygen baby birth process ) . HIE significant cause morbidity mortality infant . The known effective treatment HIE therapeutic hypothermia whole body cool for72 hour . During cool process baby get agitate , shiver uncomfortable . To treat side effect sedative-analgesic medication like morphine frequently use . Clonidine ( Clon ) , another class sedative-analgesic use similar purpose effective morphine decrease shiver adult child . Furthermore , preclinical study , clonidine show neuroprotective ( safe brain model brain injury ) . Clon ( Duraclon® ) approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment pain certain cancer patient . It approve treat side effect therapeutic hypothermia infant use study consider investigational . FDA allow u use clonidine Phase I-II study . In kind study clonidine start low dose slowly increase determine dose shiver control use clonidine associate side effect . This mean baby study get dose Clon . Doses begin study low dos end study . Because design study , baby may get dos low effect , baby probably might get dos could cause side effect . In Phase I-II study , investigator determine ( ) maximum tolerate dose clonidine cool HIE , ( ii ) effect clonidine heart rate , blood pressure , core body temperature cerebral autoregulation ( ability maintain constant blood flow face blood pressure change ) ( iii ) association blood level change parameter . In study investigator hope find way improve sedation , shiver agitation newborn infant HIE cool protocol . Our ultimate goal determine potential neuro-protective property clonidine newborn baby HIE .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Clonidine Infants With Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy During Therapeutic Hypothermia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy ( HIE ) birth asphyxia occur ~ 2-4/1000 term infant significant cause neonatal morbidity mortality . Morbidity include cerebral palsy abnormality speech , vision intellect 50-70 % survive infant . In animal human mild hypothermia provide protection ischemia brain damage . Hypothermia therapeutic intervention know effective reduce morbidity mortality associate HIE . However even mild hypothermia trigger strong thermoregulatory defense , shiver associate stress response . Failure block shiver obviates neuroprotective property hypothermia . Furthermore , newborns HIE often mechanically ventilate , thus , often treat analgesic-sedatives reduce stress response , provide anxiolysis , facilitate ventilatory support , optimize pain control . Currently , significant gap knowledge lack evidence class sedative-analgesic agent may beneficial group infant already extremely high risk poor neurological outcome . Furthermore , essentially nothing known immaturity , end organ damage therapeutic hypothermia affect pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics ( PK/PD ) sedatives-analgesics . While sedative-analgesics anesthetic , include opiate , know induce apoptosis brain , class sedatives-analgesics may neuroprotective property especially set brain injury newborn model . The desirable sedative-analgesic agent use infant HIE would 1 ) excellent safety profile , 2 ) provide adequate analgesia sedation , 3 ) reduce shiver , 4 ) cause minimal respiratory depression , 5 ) preserve cerebrovascular autoregulation , 6 ) confer neuroprotection . Several line evidence suggest alpha 2 adrenergic receptor agonist class sedatives-analgesics may property . The investigator recently develop sensitive assay measure clonidine level allow u perform population PK/PD analyse clonidine sick newborn . Thus , phase I/II trial design test hypothesis clonidine clonidine , α-2 adrenergic receptor agonist , reduce incidence shiver without adversely affect heart rate ( HR ) , blood pressure ( BP ) , temperature regulation cerebrovascular autoregulation . Essentially class sedative-analgesic agent affect mean arterial blood pressure ( MAP ) alter cerebral perfusion affect cerebrovascular autoregulation . Cerebrovascular autoregulation blood flow brain hold relatively constant wide range MAPs ; ensure steady supply oxygenate blood brain , functional within specific range MAP 's . When MAP deviate range drop low limit autoregulation , blood flow become passive MAP brain place risk ischemic injury . Brain injury alters cerebrovascular autoregulation region injury , together sub-optimal MAP hypoxic brain injury could cause brain ischemia lead poor outcome , seizure , permanent neurologic injury . Little information available effect HIE alone combination hypothermia cerebrovascular autoregulation , information publish direct effect sedative-analgesics alteration hemodynamic parameter subsequent indirect direct effect cerebrovascular autoregulation newborn HIE . Thus , study establish safety clonidine , commonly use sedative-analgesic infant child [ 4 ] , population infant HIE undergo therapeutic hypothermia . A secondary exploratory outcome determine efficacy clonidine reduce shiver cool phase therapeutic hypothermia protocol .</detailed_description>
