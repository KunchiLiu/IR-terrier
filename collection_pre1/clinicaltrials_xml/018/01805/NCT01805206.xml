	<brief_summary>During first four day life , intestinal fatty acid bind protein ( iFABP ) elevate urine premature baby go develop necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) day week later . This study aim determine whether withhold feeding baby elevate urinary iFABP reduce incidence NEC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prediction NEC With Urinary iFABP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Necrotizing enterocolits ( NEC ) occur incidence 3-7 % low birth weight ( &lt; 1500g ) infant associate significant morbidity mortality . Earlier detection subclinical prodrome NEC might allow institution measure could prevent attenuate severity disease . We demonstrate level urinary intestinal fatty acid bind protein ( iFABPu ) , sensitive specific marker intestinal mucosal injury , elevate first 4 day life infant subsequently develop NEC . We hypothesize , context elevate iFABPu neonatal period , significant proportion NEC case could avert initiating feeding . The propose study three-year prospective trial iFABPu monitoring neonatal period 220 infant gestational age le 33 week . Urine collect 12-hour aliquot first four day life iFABPu measure . On afternoon day life four , infant iFABPu exceeded 1000 pg/ml time continue feeding , iFABPu continue measure , trophic , breast milk feeding initiate iFABPu normalized five day . Infants non-elevated iFABPu first four day life feeding initiate day life four , absence contraindication . All subject urine collect daily entire hospital stay iFABPu assay . However , active study period ( feeding initiate ) iFABPu finding communicate physician care subject , evaluate retrospectively order well define utility iFABPu marker impend NEC later newborn life . If iFABPu monitor show effective reduce incidence NEC would revolutionize care premature infant provide physician tool would permit feed decision base directly upon viability intestine , rather intuition .</detailed_description>
