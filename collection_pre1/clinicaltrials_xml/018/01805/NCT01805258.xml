	<detailed_description>Drug interaction complicate concurrent treatment HIV Mycobacterium tuberculosis co-infection . Drug therapy HIV tuberculosis consist combine regimen three four drug . Tuberculosis ( TB ) significant co-infection HIV patient resource-limited setting . Application antiretroviral ( ARV ) therapy co-infected patient require care provider appropriately train use ARV TB drug . Over 40 million people worldwide currently live HIV/AIDS , 90 % live developing world , co-infected TB . There estimate 12 million person TB/HIV co-infection . According UNAIDS estimate , 5 million people acquire HIV/AIDS 2003 . India estimate 5.1 million HIV individual end 2002 . TB among frequent HIV-related opportunistic infection develop country , associate substantial morbidity mortality . In India , estimate 1.85 million HIV individual co-infected HIV TB . In patient infected HIV TB , lifetime risk develop active tuberculosis estimate least 60 % , compare approximately 10 % person infect TB HIV infection . It well establish HIV increase risk TB ( acquisition , reactivation reinfection ) , alters clinical presentation , reduce survival compare patient TB HIV infection . Multiple epidemiologic study show co-infection TB result reduce survival , increased risk opportunistic infection elevation HIV replication . Increased HIV replication attribute activation latently infect cell promotion infection uninfected lymphocyte macrophage . HIV genetic diversity also increase presence active TB infection . Mortality rate HIV-infected patient TB extraordinarily high resource- limited setting . Therefore , essential treat patient HIV TB co-infection infection . In India large number HIV positive patient suffer HIV/Tuberculosis co-infection . However , limited data available concomitant use Nevirapine Rifampicin patient co-infected HIV Tuberculosis India . No concrete data available whether Nevirapine Rifampicin safely co-administered without plasma concentration Nevirapine fall therapeutic level . Rifamycins frequently use treatment tuberculosis . Rifamycins interact several antiretrovirals . In decrease order potency , rifampin , rifapentine rifabutin induce effect drug metabolism mediate cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 ( CYP3A4 ) . Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor protease inhibitor metabolize CYP3A4 thus plasma concentration antiretrovirals may decrease presence rifamycins . Additionally , non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor metabolize CYP2B6 . Drug-drug interaction may lead suboptimal drug exposure , loss viral suppression selection resistant HIV strain . Interactions nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor rifamycins occur level glucuronidation amination , describe rifampin rifabutin zidovudine , consider clinically significant . Coinfection HIV-1 tuberculosis mainly concern develop country like India infection epidemic . Access antiretrovirals may difficult develop country limit availability high cost . To improve pricing accessibility , generic antiretroviral agent manufacture country Brazil , India , Thailand South Africa . Fixed-dose combination generic agent widely use well . The often-used generic fixed-dose combination twice-daily regimen stavudine , lamivudine nevirapine . Fixed-dose combination attractive regimen patient care . Adherence therapy may improve low pill burden reduce possibility incorrect dose . Furthermore , fixed-dose combination simplify drug logistics . Compact drug quantity facilitate storage distribution hospital , pharmacy patient . Important resource constraint setting fixed-dose combination make improvement public health care management possible . With respect treatment HIV/tuberculosis-coinfected patient , clinically significant drug-drug interaction may expect nevirapine rifamycin co-administered . Treatment rifabutin prefer favourable interaction profile , develop country rifabutin available expensive . Tuberculosis treatment regimen include rifampicin usually option . Reports literature show decrease nevirapine plasma concentration range 31 % 58 % . Rifampicin plasma concentration influence nevirapine . Low nevirapine plasma concentration may negatively affect virological outcome antiretroviral therapy . Previous study document high plasma concentration nevirapine Thai patient compare patient country , suggest even though concomitant use rifampicin lower nevirapine level considerable , still patient would still retain nevirapine plasma concentration concentration 3.1mg/l . The present study perform investigate whether rifampicin co-administration clinical practice lead clinically relevant decrease nevirapine plasma concentration North Indian patient co-infected HIV/Tuberculosis .</detailed_description>
