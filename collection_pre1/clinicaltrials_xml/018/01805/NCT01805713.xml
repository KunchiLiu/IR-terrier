	<brief_summary>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) common autosomal recessive genetic disease Caucasians . It result lung disease affect quality life cause early death . Lung damage CF start infancy continue time . Lung damage negatively affect lung function . It would ideal measure lung damage CF patient three instance : ( 1 ) During first year life diagnosis state newborn screening program , ( 2 ) In child adult long period time ( year ) , ( 3 ) During time illness ( pulmonary exacerbation ) , allow well treatment therapy prevent loss lung function . The lung make elastin , collagen cartilage . When lung damage CF , components break piece measure urine , sputum blood . These product may represent marker lung injury . We believe level marker increase time CF patient even high patient sick lung symptom . The goal research measure amount lung breakdown product urine , sputum blood infant , child adult CF time well also time illness . I also hope use new technology involve study protein metabolites sample like sputum , urine blood help provide new information regard CF lung disease . These study help u good treat CF lung disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , observational cohort study two CF population ( appropriate control population ) : Infants CF Diagnosed Newborn Screen : The purpose prospective cohort study measure concentrations biomarkers lung injury urine , blood bronchial alveolar lavage fluid ( BALF ) CF infant . We plan characterize concentration first two year life goal determine profile alone combination potentially useful biomarkers early lung disease CF . Each CF infant enrol blood , urine BALF sample , along oropharyngeal swab ( throat culture ) conjunction infant lung function test approximately 6 month age one year . Our CF Center perform infant Pulmonary Function Tests ( PFT 's ) , throat culture blood draw part routine care 6 month one year age , bronchoscopy urine collection obtain research purpose . Urine collect quarterly routine outpatient clinic visit CF Center ( 4 sample total/year two year ) also research purpose . During second year study , urine , blood throat swab sample collection plus lung function test continue per year one . In event hospitalization pulmonary exacerbation , blood urine sample obtain three time point hospitalization BALF sample obtain via bronchoscopy upon admission . An oropharyngeal culture also obtain upon admission . Subsequent hospitalization pulmonary exacerbation record sample collect described . In event outpatient exacerbation require antibiotic therapy , patient ask provide urine sample onset exacerbation . Normal CF treatment care alter way participation study . We collect urine age-matched healthy infant control group comparison . Subjects CF â‰¥ 8 Years Age : The purpose prospective cohort study measure concentrations biomarkers lung injury urine , blood sputum CF patient . This observational study involve specific treatment intervention . We plan characterize concentration two year clinically stable time point well hospitalization outpatient treatment pulmonary exacerbation . The study goal determine profile alone combination potentially useful biomarkers early lung disease CF . All study participant ( CF Exacerbation Group CF Non-Exacerbation Group ) ask provide urine , blood sputum sample , well pulmonary function test , regularly schedule quarterly CF Clinic visit study period . Quarterly lung function test standard care CF patient . For patient CF Exacerbation group , subject ask provide three urine , blood sputum sample well three set pulmonary function inpatient hospitalization pulmonary exacerbation . We incorporate PFT 's , lab do part hospital admission whenever possible , avoid duplicate testing . All hospitalized patient receive routine , standard-of-care therapy include airway clearance , nutritional support , IV antibiotic pulmonary medication . Treatment care alter way participation study . If patient CF Non-Exacerbation Group experience pulmonary exacerbation study period , sample obtain described CF Exacerbation Group . For control group comparison collect sputum urine volunteer &gt; 8 year age CF .</detailed_description>
