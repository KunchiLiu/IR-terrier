	<brief_summary>Since many year cognitive disorder main topic clinical research Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) could observe early disease could induce time patient significant socio-professional burden . Today assessment cognitive dysfunction MS still base traditional pencil-paper task test able give true representation functional burden observe patient real life situation . The development new tool close `` life situation '' , i.e . ecological , need well assess take charge cognitive impairment MS patient . One way reach goal Virtual Reality ( VR ) . VR offer new human-computer interface paradigm simulate realistic 3D environment user become immersed interacts . These last ten year VR know rapid development health domain apply success motor rehabilitation , psychiatry neuropsychology . In last domain , virtual environment ( VE ) reproduce activity daily live use evaluate executive memory function well attentional visuospatial process . Among main VE develop , drive assessment system , navigation skill , cook behavior , virtual supermarket show well sensitivity detect functional consequence cognitive impairment various neurological psychiatric disorder traditional evaluation . In Caen University Hospital , investigator use VE drive system develop use Virtual Action Planning supermarket ( VAP-S ; Klinger et al 2004 ) user move select buy grocery thing inside interactive virtual supermarket use shop cart . In preliminary study investigator use virtual interactive tool evaluate executive function small group Parkinson 's disease MS patient . Analysis initial data show feasibility VAP-S use two kind disease . According result investigator plan new study Relapsing-Remitting ( RR ) - MS patient compare use VE ( drive system VAP-S ) traditional attentional executive evaluation estimate respective sensitivity detect cognitive/functional impairment MS patient . Investigators hope show VR demonstrate interest ass cognitive function MS develop cognitive rehabilitation .</brief_summary>
