	<brief_summary>Background : - The third molar ( wisdom teeth ) normally grow late adolescence early adulthood . Many people need choose teeth remove oral surgery . Normally , remove teeth tissue throw away medical waste . However , oral health researcher want collect teeth tissue research . They also want encourage dentist National Institutes Health improve skill oral surgery . This study collect teeth tissue people need oral surgery remove wisdom teeth . Objectives : - To provide continued dental skill train dentist National Institutes Health . - To collect teeth tissue sample follow wisdom tooth removal surgery . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 50 need wisdom teeth remove . Design : - This study involve minimum three visit . There screen visit , surgery visit , least one follow-up visit . - Participants screen physical exam medical history . A full dental exam x-rays give evaluate need surgery . - At second visit , participant oral surgery remove wisdom teeth . The teeth tissue remove surgery collect study . - Participants receive drug control pain surgery . They also able contact dentist problem . - Between 7 21 day surgery , participant followup visit check healing . If problem , last visit . If postsurgery issue , schedule additional visit need .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective The objective protocol evaluate provide treatment subject clinical indication routine extraction dental third molar wisdom teeth aim allow investigator maintain expertise dental clinical care , gain additional knowledge oral health utilize surgical waste collect patient research study . Study Population The protocol enroll convenience sample 1000 subject age great equal 16-50 need clinically indicate , routine extraction third molar . Design This evaluation , treatment training protocol . Subjects receive standard evaluation treatment clinically indicate , routine extraction third molar . Subjects report NIDCR dental clinic least three visit . The first visit screen evaluation determine clinical need third molar extraction protocol eligibility . Eligible subject return second visit third molar extraction . Oral specimen remove standard procedure third molar extraction distribute research . A third visit schedule approximately one week surgery post-operative clinical evaluation . Outcome Measures There research plan protocol . However , data collect purpose research clinical quality assurance . If trend emerge warrant exploration , outcome measure describe IRB approval determination exemption request carry project .</detailed_description>
