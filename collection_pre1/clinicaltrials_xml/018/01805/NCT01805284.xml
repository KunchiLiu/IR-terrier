	<brief_summary>The objective study : ( ) evaluate proportion patient attain T &gt; MIC ( Minimum Inhibitory Concentration ) 100 % time frame . The investigator therefore plan measure unbound linezolid trough concentration administration second , third , fourth fifth dose . Furthermore , investigator assess AUC0 - 24h/MIC study subject . Therefore , multiple plasma sample draw fourth fifth dose , steady state condition reach . ( ii ) describe pharmacokinetic variability unbound linezolid concentration cohort use population pharmacokinetic model ass expect probability target attainment ( PTA ) MIC MRSA . Twenty adult , MRSA-positive , morbidly obese patient clinically radiologically document pneumonia include . Therefore , multi-centre , international observational study necessary . Given specific target population study feasible single-centre approach . The goal find 6 centre anticipate include 3 4 patient study within time frame one year . Included patient receive least 6 dos linezolid . Linezolid must administer intravenously ( iv ) one hour control infusion ( use volumetric infusion pump ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>BMI &gt; 35 Radiographically clinically document pneumonia one following : patient MRSA screenpositive high risk MRSA pneumonia ( MIC linezolid know possible ass ) patient baseline respiratory tract sample positive MRSA ; MRSA pneumonia likely empiric therapy without linezolid initiate ( obvious indication MRSA involvement ) , patient switch linezolid therapy culture result demonstrate MRSA pathogen . CAVE : patient must include study prior moment first trough sample must draw . As , patient become MRSApositive &gt; 1 dose linezolid include study . Decision start treatment linezolid least 3 day ( 6 dose 600 mg ) . Patient colonize infect MRSA ( site ) must possible sent fresh isolate central laboratory microbiology . Written informed consent patient his/her legal representative . Exclusion : Contraindications describe summary product characteristic ( SPC ) .</criteria>
