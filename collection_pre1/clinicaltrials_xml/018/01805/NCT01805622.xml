	<brief_title>Educational Program Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening : Cluster Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , investigator aim evaluate 20 community coalition 7,200 participant : test passive active approach disseminate Educational Program Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening ( EPICS ) increase screen rate colorectal cancer ; measure extent EPICS accept fidelity implementation various setting estimate potential translatability public health impact EPICS . This four-arm cluster randomize trial ( five community coalition plus 1,800 African Americans , 50-74 year age , current colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screen per arm ) compare follow implementation strategy : ( 1 ) web access facilitator training material toolkits without technical assistance ( TA ) ; ( 2 ) web access , technical assistance ( TA ) ; ( 3 ) in-person access facilitator training material toolkits without TA ( 4 ) in-person access TA . Primary outcome measure reach ( proportion representative eligible community coalition individual participate trial ) effectiveness ( post-intervention change CRC screen rate ) . Secondary outcome include adoption ( percentage community coalition implement EPICS session ) implementation ( quality consistency intervention delivery ) . The extent community coalition continue implement EPICS post-implementation ( maintenance ) also measure . Cost-effectiveness analysis conduct compare passive active dissemination cost . Investigators believe implement evidence-based colorectal cancer screen intervention partnership community coalition result rapid adoption traditional top-down approach , change community CRC screening practice likely sustainable time . With national reach , study potential enhance understand barrier enablers uptake educational program aim eliminate cancer health disparity .</detailed_description>
