	<brief_summary>A significant number patient relapse eventually die , particularly initially diagnose large node involvement and/or T3/4 disease . When analysis focus patient ER+/Her2-negative breast cancer , ≥4N+ , 30 % relapse 5 year , emphasize need new drug set ( PACS01 data , UNICANCER internal data ) . Strong evidence suggest cross-talk phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) /AKT/mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) pathway ER signal link hormone resistance breast cancer patient . In present study , plan evaluate benefit add everolimus standard endocrine treatment three year treatment patient ER+/HER2- high risk relapse due high node involvement ( ≥4 ) and/or persistent node involvement neo-adjuvant chemotherapy . Genomic signatures emerge last 10 year new additive mean evaluate precisely long term prognosis , instance amount benefit chemotherapy endocrine therapy adjuvant setting . Therefore UNIRAD study propose patient 1-3 positive lymph node primary surgery high risk relapse EndoPredict test . This study unique opportunity prove efficacy everolimus adjuvant setting . The study could practice change case positive result could allow improve outcome breast cancer patient present high risk metastatic relapse .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Female ≥ 18 year age , 2 . Histologically proven invasive unilateral bilateral breast cancer ( regardless morphological subtype ) , 3 . Any T , M0 4 . Patient high risk relapse accord one condition : least 4 positive lymph node patient primary surgery least 1 positive lymph node surgery conduct neo adjuvant chemotherapy hormone therapy least 3 month duration 13 positive lymph node ( pN1a , b , c ) primary surgery AND EPClin score ≥ 3.32867 Note : Access primary tumor patient 13 node positive mandatory . Patient EPClin score &lt; 3.32867 randomize , follow yearly 10 year . 5 . ER+ HER2 negative : Hormone receptor positive define stain primary tumor , HER2 negativity define IHC 01+ , [ IHC 2+ FISH CISH nonamplified ] 6 . Primary tumor completely resect ( deep margin overlie skin involvement allow fully resect ) 7 . Patients begin adjuvant hormone therapy receive maximum 4 year adjuvant hormone therapy . Hormone therapy could either +/ LHRH agonist , letrozole , anastrozole exemestane . 8 . No clinically radiologically detectable metastasis time inclusion . 9. WHO Performance status ( ECOG ) 0 1 . 10 . Adequate hematological function ( neutrophil count ≥ 2x109/l ; platelet count ≥ 100x109/l ) 11 . Adequate hepatic function : AST ALT ≤ 2.5 ULN , alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 ULN , total bilirubin ≤ 2 ULN . 12 . Adequate renal function : serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 ULN . 13 . Signed write informed consent . 1 . Any local , regional recurrence metastatic disease . 2 . Any clinical radiological suspicion malignant premalignant disease contralateral breast . 3 . Patients pN1mi sole nodal involvement 4 . Previous cancer ( except basal cell carcinoma skin situ carcinoma cervix ) precede 5 year , include invasive contralateral breast cancer . 5 . Patient already include another ongoing therapeutic trial involve unlicensed drug followup require . 6 . Patient pregnant breastfeeding . Adequate birth control measure take study treatment phase . 7 . Patient significantly impair lung function ( e.g . Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease , respiratory insufficiency , Interstitial Lung Disease ) 8 . Positive serology HIV infection hepatitis C. 9 . Chronic carrier HBV ( positive Antigen HbsAg positive blood ) 10 . Patient chronic infection 11 . Uncontrolled diabetes define glycated haemoglobin , HbA1c &gt; 7 % 12 . Uncontrolled hypercholesterolemia ( cholesterol &gt; 300 mg/dl adequate therapy ) . 13 . Known hypersensitivity active substance , rapamycin derivative excipients . 14 . Patient concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical disease infection could compromise participation study ( e.g . patient regularly require systemic steroid control comorbid disease ) . 15 . Patient psychological , familial , social geographical condition could potentially hamper compliance study protocol followup schedule ; condition discuss patient registration trial .</criteria>
