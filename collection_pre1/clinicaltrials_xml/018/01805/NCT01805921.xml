	<brief_summary>In study test new vaccine Respiratory Syncytial Virus ( RSV ) . This virus cause respiratory infection bronchiolitis pneumonia . It affect age , especially infant , adult suppress immune system , elderly . RSV infects human occur epidemic winter . It single common cause severe respiratory illness child . There effective anti-viral medication treat RSV infection . There monoclonal antibody , give 'at-risk ' child give injection monthly basis winter provide short term protection infection , partially effective prohibitively expensive . Currently , license vaccine prevent RSV infection remain real need develop vaccine cost-effective method save life reduce cost disease cause RSV .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>RSV001 - A New Vaccine Prevent Severe Viral Chest Infections .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We test two new RSV vaccine , give different combination different route administration . Each vaccine use RSV protein stimulate immune response . These protein F ( Fusion ) , N ( Nucleocapsid ) M2-1 ( Matrix ) proteins . The F protein sit surface virus need infect human cell . Antibodies protein important mechanism prevent infection . The N M2-1 protein need viral replication target immune recognition . The two vaccine study contain three protein . However , deliver body use different 'vectors ' , harmless carrier virus . In study , employ two different vector : simian adenovirus ( PanAd3 ) Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara ( MVA ) . We administer vaccine use 'prime-boost ' strategy , one vaccine use 'prime ' immune system , 'boosted ' 4 8 week later , depend group , administration alternative vaccine vaccine give different route .</detailed_description>
