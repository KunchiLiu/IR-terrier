	<brief_summary>The purpose study characterize composition hard soft tissue present regenerative endodontic procedure root canal teeth previously diagnose need extraction orthodontic treatment incomplete root formation . Although protocol address study currently use clinical practice , prospective clinical trial investigate efficacy stimulate continued root development nature newly form tissue .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Twenty subject permanent bilateral premolar teeth incomplete root development schedule extraction due orthodontic requirement treat regeneration protocol . Teeth ( n=20/group ) extract 3 month follow regenerative protocol pulpectomy control . The protocol rely disinfection canal space copious irrigation common endodontic irrigants placement triple antibiotic paste ( regenerative group ) calcium hydroxide dress ( control group ) disinfect root period one month . In patient , treatment arm perform . Thus , treatment sample contralateral match control ( paired design ) . At end one month , intracanal medicament ( triple antibiotic paste ) irrigate canal blood clot stimulate canal aid endodontic file introduce periapical tissue ; blood clot serve scaffold tissue proliferation within canal . The regenerative treatment tooth restore prevent bacteria oral cavity re-contaminating canal space . For contralateral control tooth , medication remain tooth extraction date . The subject study treat teeth extract 3 month initial treatment . The extracted teeth study participant place storage medium Immunohistochemical analysis antibody characterize tissue/cells within canal .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patient Children age 918 bilateral premolar incomplete root development schedule extraction orthodontic reason . Children seem cooperative dental treatment able indicate willingness obtain treatment participate study capable verbally express dissent . Parents express understand study treatment consent treatment child regenerative procedure prior tooth extraction orthodontic reason . Healthy patient ( ASA Class I II physical status ) systemic health problem may interfere heal cell growth . Tooth inclusion criterion : Permanent premolar teeth immature root development healthy pulp schedule extraction due orthodontic requirement . Clinically confirm teeth good periodontal health assess periodontal probe depth le 4mm . Patient Parents patient unable give consent express dissent . Patients unwilling undergo research orthodontic dental treatment . Patients affect tempromandibular joint disorder . Patients affect known orofacial pain disorder . Patients ASA Class III IV physical status ( Immunocompromised patient include patient selfreport HIV carrier , undergo steroid therapy chemotherapy , selfreport genetic systemic disease could result reduce immune response ) . Tooth Teeth vertical crack extend cementoenamel junction . Teeth isolate use rubber dam . Teeth nonodontogenic pathology . Teeth whose apex fully develop , determine radiographically correlate dental age patient .</criteria>
