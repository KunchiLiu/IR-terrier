	<brief_title>Teneligliptin ( MP-513 ) v . Placebo Patient With Metformin Monotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Although many different oral antidiabetic agent currently available , approximately 50 % treat Type 2 diabetic subject reach currently accept goal HbA1c ( Oral communication , American Diabetic Association , 2008 ) - Subjects frequently prescribe agent cause hypoglycemia , and/or weight gain . Metformin usually unwanted effect , standard first line therapy treat type 2 diabetic mellitus European union . - Nonclinical pharmacodynamic study reveal MP-513 effectively improve glucose tolerance animal model type 2 diabetes , whilst compound little potential cause hypoglycaemia , commonly report adverse event many currently market product . - The nonclinical study also suggest inhibitory effect MP-513 DPP-Ⅳ potent durable DPP-Ⅳ inhibitor development . The result safety pharmacology toxicology also reveal MP-513 relatively wide margin safety . - Thus , MP-513 expect good efficacy tolerability subject type 2 diabetes mellitus once-daily administration .</detailed_description>
