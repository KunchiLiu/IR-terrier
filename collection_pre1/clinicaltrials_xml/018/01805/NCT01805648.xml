	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Study Maintenance Treatment With rhTPO Thrombocytopenic Subjects With ITP</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The eligible subject ITP firstly receive pre-treatment rhTPO 300 IU/Kg daily 14 day . The subject two consecutive platelet count 50×10^9/L pre-treatment period begin receive maintenance treatment rhTPO 300 IU/Kg 12 week . In period maintenance treatment , start dose interval rhTPO every day follow interval adjustment keep platelet count 30 ×10^9/L～100 ×10^9/L . Subsequently , subject stop treatment rhTPO follow 4 week maintenance treatment . Platelet count , bleed symptom evaluate treatment . Platelet transfusion administer subject active bleeding symptom . Toxicity monitor continuously entire study . Safety assess adverse event laboratory test .</detailed_description>
