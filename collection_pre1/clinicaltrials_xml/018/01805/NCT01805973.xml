	<brief_summary>An abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) enlargement balloon main artery supply high pressure blood heart body . AAAs may continue stretch burst ( rupture ) causing 7000 death per year United Kingdom ( UK ) ; 2.1 % death men 65 . Planned repair rupture critical National AAA Screening Programme ( NAAASP ) introduce identify AAAs men rupture . Screening identify 9000 men per year previously undiagnosed AAA . More 90 % screen detect AAAs small , require repair , enter ultrasound follow-up ( surveillance ) may benefit exercise improve fitness repair . Over 4000 elective AAA repair per year perform UK suggest exercise training weight loss may reduce mortality complication AAA repair . This pilot study examine feasibility supervise exercise training patient AAAs determine optimal duration training achieve worthwhile improvement fitness .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) affect 4 % men age 65-79 , prevalence rise population age . As patient suffer rupture die immediately , elective AAA repair critical National AAA Screening Programme ( NAAASP ) implement across UK identify AAAs elective repair . Manchester first major urban population screen . The UK high mortality rate follow elective open AAA repair Europe ( 7 % v 3.5 % ) ; AAA Quality Improvement Programme 's ( AAAQIP ) target reduce 3.5 % 2013 . The benefit exercise across broad spectrum medical condition increasingly recognise ; especially elderly . Exercise training may reduce mortality complication major surgery . Cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPET ) measure cardiopulmonary reserve predict outcome major surgery . The Manchester CPET study group demonstrate anaerobic threshold ( AT ) peak oxygen consumption ( VO2 peak ) predict 30 90-day mortality elective AAA repair . The investigator propose pilot randomise control trial ( RCT ) determine whether structured exercise programme improve fitness measure CPET , optimal duration training AAA surgery . As 90 % AAAs detect screen &lt; 5.5cm enter surveillance , patient offer unique opportunity explore ideal duration exercise training surgery indicated month year . 100 participant AAA surveillance recruit randomise either exercise training standard preoperative care ( 50 arm ) answer follow research question : 1 . Can supervise exercise programme improve performance CPET measure predict outcome AAA surgery ? 2 . What optimal period training need achieve significant improvement CPET score ? 3 . How long exercise-induced improvement fitness sustain ? 4 . The economic health cost supervise exercise training programme Exercise subject attend 60 minute supervise exercise programme moderate intensity ( 70 % heart rate reserve ) x3/week local gym . All participant undergo CPET assessment cardiopulmonary fitness complete health-related quality life ( Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey ) baseline 18 week . The exercise subject undergo CPET study 6 , 12 36 week investigate duration training need optimise fitness length time improvement fitness persist . Other important health relate outcome include blood pressure lipid profile frequency health service visit ( e.g . General Practitioner appointment ) record participant baseline 18 week provide data effect exercise health care cost . Longitudinal regression model , Normal Poisson distribution appropriate , use ass difference group respect CPET change , health-related outcome frequency health service visit whole study period . This pilot study also explore strategy encourage participation compliance exercise may also improve general health outcome save National Health Service ( NHS ) cost reduce demand . The overall aim collect data need design definitive multicentre trial whether physical exercise reduces morbidity and/or mortality AAA repair . Those age &gt; 65 fast grow segment population . This pilot study contribute public health policy drive impact physical activity functional capacity , quality life independence .</detailed_description>
