	<brief_summary>The main aim clinical study find maximum dose give safely patient , potential side effect drug manage . The study also look happen Anti-CD19 ( DI-B4 ) inside body . DI-B4 type drug call Anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody use stop growth kill cancerous immune cell target B-cell marker ( CD-19 ) express surface . This drug give patient . DI-B4 give weekly intravenous infusion four week . The study two part . In Part 1 , small group patient treat increase dos find high safest dose best dose part 2 study . Approximately 16-20 patient treated part . In Part 2 , dose identify Part 1 give approximately 20 patient . Patients recruit study receive four week ( cycle ) treatment . They attend end therapy visit eight week last dose DI-B4 , attend follow-up visit eighteen month first dose DI-B4 . Information overall progression free survival collect period eighteen month final patient treat study . Patients blood urine sample take week treatment amongst clinical test . CT scan perform start study , eight week post treatment six month study start . Bone marrow biopsy FDG-PET scan take need . Research blood sample also take look happen drug inside body . It important explain patient advance cancer unlikely patient benefit directly take part study may help improve future treatment cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Trial DI-B4 Patients With Advanced CD19 Positive Indolent B-cell Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients relapse refractory CD19 positive indolent B-cell lymphoma , Waldenström Macroglobulinaemia chronic lymphocytic leukaemia enter study . For vast majority patient , B-cell non Hodgkin lymphoma chronic lymphocytic leukaemia incurable use exist therapeutic approach . Although anti-CD20 directed therapy improve outcome , fifty percent patient still relapse follow treatment refractory therefore additional novel non-cross resistant therapy urgently require . DI-B4 humanise , low-fucosylated anti-CD19 Immunoglobulin ( Ig ) G1 monoclonal antibody potent antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) minimal complement dependent cytotoxicity ( CDC ) . The target antigen , CD19 , canonical B-cell marker express B-cells include malignant B-cells NHL , CLL acute lymphoblastic leukaemia ( ALL ) . The CD19 antigen therefore attractive B-cell lineage specific target monoclonal antibody therapy . DI-B4 expect act depletion normal malignant CD19 positive cell , primarily via ADCC . This multi-centre , Phase I , dose escalation/dose expansion study . For first three cohort , intra-patient dose escalation scheme follow unless DLT observe . From Cohort 4 onwards , standard 3 + 3 dose escalation schedule DI-B4 continue maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) define , maximum dose 1000mg .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically proven relapsed refractory indolent Bcell lymphoma chronic lymphocytic leukaemia . Patients must receive least one line previous therapy . 2 . CD19 positive malignancy demonstrate immunohistochemistry flow cytometry 3 . Life expectancy least 12 week 4 . World Health Organisation ( WHO ) performance status 01 5 . Haematological biochemical index within range show . These measurement must perform within one week ( Day 7 Day 1 ) patient commences treatment DIB4 . Laboratory Test Value require Haemoglobin ( Hb ) ≥ 9.0 g/dL ( red cell support permissible ) , Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1.0 x 10^9/L ( ≥0.5 x 10^9/L bone marrow involvement ) , Platelet count ≥75 x 10^9/L ( ≥30 x 10^9/L bone marrow involvement ) , Serum bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , unless raise due Gilbert 's syndrome case 3 x ULN permissible Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) and/or aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 2.5 x ( ULN ) unless raise due hepatic involvement case 5 x ULN permissible 6 . 18 year 7 . Written ( sign date ) inform consent capable cooperate treatment followup 8 . Indolent Bcell lymphoma patient : Patient either least one measurable lesion CT scan ( define &gt; 1.5 cm one axis ) case Waldenström 's macroglobulinemia , disease must assessable protocol criterion . 1 . Radiotherapy ( except palliative reason ) , endocrine therapy , immunotherapy , chemotherapy investigational medicinal product previous 4 week treatment . 2 . Ongoing toxic manifestation previous treatment . Exceptions alopecia certain Grade 1 toxicity , opinion Investigator Drug Development Office ( DDO ) exclude patient . 3 . Known serologically positive hepatitis B ( unless due vaccination ) , hepatitis C human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . 4 . Patients clinically active leptomeningeal central nervous system lymphoma/leukaemia . 5 . Patients transform lymphoma preexist indolent lymphoma . Patients previous history transformation , disease episode biopsy proven indolent recurrence may include . 6 . Patients receive corticosteroid , except patient stable dose precede seven day . Doses prednisolone equivalent &gt; 10 mg daily permit whilst study , dose 20mg take time prior Cycle 1 , Day 1 7 . Concurrent congestive heart failure , prior history class III/ IV cardiac disease ( New York Heart Association [ NYHA ] ) , history unstable angina pectoris myocardial infarction 1 year prior patient enrolment trial , presence severe valvular heart disease presence ventricular arrhythmia require treatment 8 . Ability become pregnant ( already pregnant lactate ) . However , female patient negative serum urine pregnancy test enrolment agree use two highly effective form contraception ( oral , injected implant hormonal contraception condom , intrauterine device condom , diaphragm spermicidal gel condom ) trial six month afterwards consider eligible . 9 . Male patient partner childbearing potential ( unless agree take measure father child use one form highly effective contraception [ condom plus spermicide ] trial six month afterwards ) . Men pregnant lactate partner advise use barrier method contraception ( e.g . condom plus spermicidal gel ) prevent exposure foetus neonate . 10 . Major thoracic abdominal surgery patient yet recover . 11 . At high medical risk nonmalignant systemic disease include active uncontrolled infection . 12 . Is participant plan participate another interventional clinical trial , whilst take part Phase I study DIB4 . Participation observational trial would acceptable . 13 . Any condition Investigator‟s opinion would make patient good candidate clinical trial .</criteria>
