	<brief_summary>Background : - GS-7977 , GS-5885 , GS-9669 , GS-9451 new drug treat hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection . GS-7977 may help treat infection use treatment like interferon therapy . GS-5885 , GS-9669 , GS-9451 also low amount HCV body . Researchers want see whether GS-7977 combine three drug treat HCV infection . Some participant take GS-7977 GS-5885 . Others take GS-7977 , GS-5885 GS-9669 GS-7977 , GS-5885 GS-9451 . Objectives : - To see whether GS-7977 GS-5885 alone combination either GS-9669 9451 use treat HCV infection . Eligibility : Individuals least 18 year age chronic HCV infection never treat . Individuals least 18 year age chronic HCV infection respond interferon therapy . Individuals least 18 year age chronic HCV infection advance liver disease never treat HCV Design : Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood sample collect . A liver biopsy may also perform . Some participant take two study drug take three study drug . Those take GS-7977 GS-5885 one daily tablet name fix dose combination FDC . Those take GS-7977 CS-9669 three daily tablet take daily . Those take GS-7977 GS-5885 GS-9451 take 2 pill day . GS-7977 GS-5885 combine one pill GS-9451 another pill . Treatment monitor frequent blood test . These test check liver function level HCV infection . Participants may blood test need treatment . Participants 6 , 8 , 12 week treatment depend study drug schedule take . After complete schedule , stop treatment study drug . They may also another liver biopsy . Participants regular follow-up visit next 48 week . They physical exam provide blood sample ... .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Therapy Chronic Hepatitis C Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection major public health problem estimate 180 million people infected worldwide . In United States estimate 4.1 million people infected , HCV principal cause death liver disease lead indication liver transplantation . While treatment ribavirin ( RBV ) pegylated interferon ( PEG ) combination boceprevir/telaprevir currently recommend therapy chronic HCV infection superior cure rate compare PEG+RBV alone HCV monoinfected patient , treatment still associate high incidence adverse event ( AEs ) , discontinuation , poor cure rate several population . Recent study demonstrate use combination antiviral , target HCV without interferon ( IFN ) , cure HCV without additional toxicity . However , determinant response IFN-free regimen establish . This open label study ass safety , tolerability , efficacy treatment GS-7977 GS-5885 , alone combination GS-9669 and/or GS-9451 ( selective HCV nucleotide NS5B , NS5A , nonnucleotide NS5B NS3 inhibitor , respectively ) HCV infect treatment na ( SqrRoot ) treatment experience patient early advance liver disease . The finding study aid understand determinant response IFN-free regimen HCV infect patient patient early advance liver disease well patient treatment na ( SqrRoot ) treat HCV .</detailed_description>
