	<brief_summary>The purpose study test whether patient undergo breast MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) breast surgery well result surgery . Breast tumor routinely evaluate use mammogram ultrasound surgery . This study would like find use MRI addition mammography surgery improve ability evaluate tumor decide kind surgery best patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MRI Mammography Before Surgery Patients With Stage I-II Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomized trial preoperative breast MRI patient deem eligible breast conserving surgery conventional clinical criterion provide important information clinical biologic relevance occult disease identify MRI alone . Patients assigned standard pre-operative breast cancer disease assessment without addition MRI prior breast conserve surgery standard pre-operative breast cancer disease assessment use MRI prior breast conserve surgery . The primary objective compare rate local-regional recurrence ( LRR ) follow attempt breast conserve therapy cohort woman triple negative HER-2 amplify breast cancer randomize preoperative staging mammography ( control arm ) mammography plus breast MRI ( MRI arm ) . Secondary objective : - To compare re-operation rate follow attempted breast conserve therapy woman assess preoperatively breast MRI assess without use breast MRI - To compare local recurrence rate woman undergo BCT control arm woman undergo BCT MRI arm - To compare conversion rate mastectomy secondary persistent positive margin poor cosmesis within first 6 month attempt BCT ( prior administration RT ) woman assess preoperatively breast MRI assess without use breast MRI - To compare contralateral breast cancer rate woman randomize preoperative breast MRI receive pre-operative breast MRI - To compare disease-free survival rate woman assess preoperatively breast MRI assess without use breast MRI - To compare breast cancer specific overall survival outcome woman assess preoperatively breast MRI assess without use breast MRI - To estimate rate MRI-guided localization assist surgery - To estimate rate multi-centric disease index breast woman MRI arm - To evaluate accuracy index lesion characteristic factor predict multi-centricity cohort randomize breast MRI - To assess positive predictive value ( PPV ) MRI detect ipsilateral multi-centric disease contralateral disease woman breast cancer undergo preoperative breast MRI - To estimate false positive rate detection multiple focus breast cancer MRI All register patient monitored relapse survival 5 year date surgery . Patients follow minimum every 4 month first 2 year diagnosis minimum every 6 month year 3-5 . Patients monitor local , regional , distant relapse vital status .</detailed_description>
