	<brief_title>Return Work : Promoting Health Productivity Workers With Common Mental Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Common mental disorder , adjustment , anxiety depressive disorder highly prevalent work population associate impaired work function high sick leave rate . For mental health disorder , several establish treatment exist , Cognitive Behavior Therapy ( CBT ) , pharmacotherapy , physical activity . However , less evidence available treatment increase individual 's ability return work ( RTW ) he/she common mental disorder . In particular , effectiveness psychotherapeutic intervention RTW largely unknown even though type intervention common recommend National Board Health Welfare common mental disorder Sweden . The study psychotherapeutic intervention ( mostly CBT ) evaluate indicate equally less effective enhance RTW compare intervention . In Swedish rehabilitation guarantee , CBT-treatments subside base assumption improve health status contribute earlier RTW . However , result first evaluation rehabilitation guarantee point contrary . RTW actually delay CBT common mental disorder compare treatment usual ( TAU ) ( 5 ) . Traditionally , CBT manual orient towards reduce symptom . Likewise , outcome measure generally consist symptom-based scale . In recent study , specific RTW CBT-manual develop include target return work context , result early RTW . Self-reported mental health symptom reduce similar extent regular CBT . This imply room improvement CBT-manuals orienting treatment towards specific area functioning , without loss symptom specific improvement . Even though CBT proven effective several mental condition , little known intervention lead change change come . This especially true come RTW . There various treatment intent vary result , however , little nothing know beyond subjective reason active process treatment , mediator might lead reduce sickness absence . Moderators refer characteristic influence direction magnitude relation intervention outcome . There several study discuss factor might predict sickness absence . However , help u understand treatment work , work condition , specific focus mediator well moderator within study reduce sick leave need . One construct would appear useful understand facilitate RTW CBT implement self-efficacy . In short , self-efficacy belief individual his/her capacity perform specific behavior successfully . When applied RTW , people low self-efficacy would believe might fail fulfill work demand work role . These efficacy cognition expect prominently present among mental health problem , mental disorder often erode positive self-concept nature disorder . Lagerveld et al develop self-efficacy questionnaire specifically orient capture self-efficacy expectation regard RTW return-to-work self-efficacy sick list employee mental health problem . RTW-SE proven robust predictor actual return work , however also serve mediator change remain explored . Another intervention model support increase RTW inclusion workplace intervention ( WI ) rehabilitation program . In Dutch RCT , Blonk et al compare CBT perform trained therapist treatment `` labor expert '' brief instruction CBT principle , control . They find significantly good RTW labor expert group compare CBT , differ control . In Swedish study , manualized WI evaluate found significantly well compare ( non-randomized ) control . A third method interesting relation RTW due primary focus improve function rather symptom reduction CBT-method , Acceptance Commitment Therapy ( ACT ) . According theoretical frame ACT , psychological discomfort result experiential avoidance . Experiential avoidance implies attempt avoid painful thought , emotion physical sensation even attempt counteracts effective behavior term live accordance personal value . High level experiential avoidance associate psychopathology include depression , anxiety low quality life . The clinical goal ACT reduce experiential avoidance instead enhance psychological flexibility implies development broader flexible behavior accordance personal value , also presence negative stimulus . Several study show general measure psychological process predict wide-range work-related outcome , mental health work attitude job performance absence rate . A side effect live functional life often self-reported psychological symptom decline . According ACT theory , psychological flexibility would key process change , however data available present support statement relation RTW . The duration sick leave also influence many factor socio-demographic , medical , work-related organizational factor , well factor health-care legislative system . Diagnosis burnout , depression anxiety disorder associate increased risk long-term sickness absence . Previous sickness absence increase risk long-term sickness absence also adjustment socio-demographic factor self-reported health status . This may imply short-term sickness absence social health-related consequence beyond effect ill health reflect . However , finding may explore take severity diagnosis account , need evaluate comprehensive study . Based summary current knowledge , primary aim present study evaluate efficacy two different intervention , ACT workplace intervention ( WPI ) , standalone treatment combine , compare TAU . The second aim examine different variable moderate program efficacy mediate change RTW different intervention . The third aim evaluate cost-effectiveness . General research question project include 1 . What efficacy cost-effectiveness two different rehabilitation model , one base psychotherapy , ACT , workplace-interventions , WPI , offer standalone intervention combination patient adjustment , anxiety depressive disorder ? 2 . Examination mediator moderator might explain difference RTW individual common mental disorder participate rehabilitation intervention ? 3 . Does actual use prescribe selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ( SNRI ) increase RTW compare non-use prescribed SSRI SNRI among patient adjustment , anxiety depressive disorder ? Methods The study RCT repeat measure mixed design . Measures take pre- post-treatment 6 , 12 , 24 60 month follow-up . Participants recruit National Insurance Office ( NIO ) start February 2013 . Individuals age 18-60 living county Stockholm least 50 % employment rate apply sick pay due common mental disorder consecutively invite diagnostic interview assessment inclusion period . Individuals meet inclusion criterion give informed consent invite participate . A power analysis base study WPI Björn Karlsson give order get 80 % power , 72 participant require group . 320 participant randomize one 4 group . The intervention : 1 . ACT ; The ACT intervention consist 6 manual-based face-to-face session internet-based homework module . The manual base six core process ACT-model : acceptance , mindfulness , defusion , self context , value commit action . 2 . WPI ; This intervention aim facilitation dialogue participant workplace series step consist individual interview participant his/her near supervisor call `` convergence dialogue meeting '' order agree upon short- long-term solution . 3 . ACT + WPI ; In group , participant collaterally receive ACT WPI intervention . 4 . Control group ; Treatment usual ( TAU ) mean participant continue ordinary health care receive intervention initial assessment . Independent variable : 1 . Consists within-group variable Time five measurement point : pre- , post treatment , 6 , 12 , 24 60 month . 2 . Consists between-groups variable Treatment condition four condition describe . 3 . Consists between-groups variable Use non-use prescribed SSRI SNRI report patient questionnaire . Dependent variable Primary outcome measure RTW base register data NIO , self-reported data regard short-term absence ( period less 14 day ) self-reported work ability accord Work Ability Index ( WAI ) . Secondary outcome measure symptom severity general function . Depression measure MADRS-S ( Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale ) HAD - subscale Depression ( Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ) , anxiety HAD - subscale Anxiety , Burnout symptoms Karolinska Exhaustion Disorder Scale ( KEDS ) . General function measure Work Social Adjustment Scale general satisfaction life Satisfaction life scale ( SWLS ) . Measures mediator take connection treatment session include : Return To Work Self Efficacy scale ( RTW-SE ) , The work-related acceptance action questionnaire ( WAAQ ) Bull´s Eye Values Survey ( BEVS ) . Measures moderator include : demographic data , sick day past five year , pre score self-rated symptom ( MADRS-S , HAD , KEDS ) . Statistical analysis Efficacy assess Mixed model repeat measure . Mixed regression model powerful way conduct intent-to-treat analysis . Unlike normal analysis variance/analysis covariance , model use available data participant take account obtain outcome miss data . Mediational analysis base Baron &amp; Kenny´s requirement test mediation . Cost-effectiveness base combination cost-effectiveness analyse cost-utility-analyses accord Manual Assessment Cost-effectiveness-analysis REHSAM base contemporary guideline health economic science practice . This research provide opportunity well understand process RTW individual sick-absence due common mental disorder . A theoretical understanding mechanism behind treatment change , may differ different subgroup , important ultimately able maximize change treatment individual sick-leave . This study might significantly contribute answer real everyday question clinician face well policy maker agency work task increase RTW promote public health</detailed_description>
