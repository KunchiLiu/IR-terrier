	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safe effective combination two different drug ( brentuximab vedotin rituximab ) patient certain type lymphoma . This study patient type lymphoma express tumor marker call CD30 and/or type associate Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV-related lymphoma ) yet receive treatment cancer , except dose-reduction discontinuation ( stoppage ) medication use prevent rejection transplant organ ( patient undergone transplantation ) . This study investigate combination brentuximab vedotin rituximab first treatment lymphoma patient</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brentuximab Vedotin + Rituximab Frontline Therapy Pts w/ CD30+ and/or EBV+ Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety brentuximab vedotin rituximab patient lymphoid malignancy cluster differentiation ( CD ) 30 positive ( + ) and/or Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) + , determine recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) combination . ( Phase I ) II . To evaluate efficacy , measure response rate , brentuximab vedotin rituximab patient lymphoid malignancy CD30+ and/or EBV+ . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate frequency severity toxicity . ( Phase II ) II . To evaluate clinical efficacy combination brentuximab vedotin rituximab , measure progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) one year end treatment . ( Phase II ) III . To determine effect combination brentuximab vedotin rituximab marker EBV activation proliferation . ( Phase II ) IV . Further evaluate efficacy measure time cytotoxic chemotherapy . ( Phase II ) V. Further evaluate efficacy measure observed rate graft rejection . ( Phase II ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether extent CD30 expression predict response outcome . II . To determine whether extent expression EBV marker predict response outcome . III . To determine whether change serum level EBV correlate response subsequent loss response therapy . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study brentuximab vedotin follow phase II study . INDUCTION : Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute weekly 3 week rituximab IV weekly 4 week . Patients unable achieve complete remission ( CR ) may receive additional optional consolidation therapy identical induction therapy . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Patients receive brentuximab vedotin IV every 3 week rituximab IV every 6 week . Treatment repeat every 21 day 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
