	<brief_summary>Magnetization transfer image magnetic resonance technique use last year , know ability detect abnormality difficult detect conventional MRI technique . The investigator would like test use 7 Tesla MRI research scanner help u diagnose Multiple Sclerosis efficiently compare current clinical practice , i.e . Multiple Sclerosis lesion Gray Matter readily identify associated disease stage Magnetic Transfer MRI image oppose conventional procedure . Image analysis allow investigator perform lesion segmentation sequence comparison different MRI technique . The investigator apply computation technique measure local cortical thickness . Repeated scan 6 monthly interval two year give insight change cortical thickness time . Based obtain data investigator look relationship lesion load White Matter Gray Matter , cortical thickness disease stage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation GM Pathology Using Ultra High Field ( 7T ) MRI Scanner</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose study : This research group previously investigate usefulness powerful new MRI scanner find 7 Tesla MRI able provide detail structural image cortex brain uncover pathology cortical demyelinating lesion MS patient . Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) affect grey matter well white matter brain spinal cord . However white matter lesion easily visible pathologically MRI , therefore MS research focus white matter demyelination . The investigator would like ass whether MS lesion Gray Matter well White Matter readily identify Magnetic Transfer Ratio ( MTR ) image oppose standard protocol DIR , T2* T1-weighted MPRAGE compare result manual detection . The investigator correlate lesion load cortical thickness lesion load cortical thickness disease state globally regional basis . The investigator compare average , normalized profile different cortical ribbon region patient control determine whether particular layer cortical strip affect . The investigator also correlate Gray Matter change distant neighbor White Matter lesion . In addition , investigator also build average lesion map across subject , compare result publish literature . The investigator use manual lesion map characterize region cortex deviate normally appear Gray Matter . How project carry : The investigator study patient MS neurological disease , patient follow already neurology . All patient would already brain scan . For comparison purpose investigator study healthy volunteer , order demonstrate new finding demonstrable 7T MRI scan indeed related pathology . Ethical issue : Occasionally investigator discover incidental abnormality brain scan participate study . In circumstance investigator adhere University Nottingham Incidental Findings Procedure . In Participant Information Sheet investigator explain investigator notice abnormality MR scan ( healthy volunteer ) abnormality MR scan expect see patient 's neurological diagnosis ( patient ) investigator refer GP . The investigator send letter patient 's GP informing investigator detect possible abnormality scan . The investigator show scan radiologist base Academic Radiology QMC , contact participant 's GP action require .</detailed_description>
