	<brief_summary>Cancer therapy place childhood cancer survivor increase risk heart disease lead significant illness early death . Interventions occur late evolution treatment-related heart disease usually ineffective prevent progression death heart transplant . Our team work several research core test new image biomarker method lead early detection heart disease clinical symptom develop become apparent standard imaging test . We evaluate importance genetic difference individual determine great risk develop heart disease result exposure cardiotoxic agent . We combine genetic information novel image biomarker method predict child particular risk . These vulnerable child target modify cancer therapy reduce exposure cardiac toxin , introduce medication protect heart chemotherapy damage . This team bring together expertise clinician scientist pediatric oncology , pediatric adult cardiology , radiation oncology , genetics , biostatistics . This cross-Canada initiative leverage late knowledge cardiac toxicity create resource ongoing research important cause morbidity mortality childhood cancer survivor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This multi-centre observational cohort study conduct The Hospital Sick Children ( Toronto ) , Princess Margaret Hospital ( Toronto ) , McMaster Children 's Hospital ( Hamilton ) , London Health Sciences Centre ( London ) , The Children 's Hospital Eastern Ontario ( Ottawa ) The Children 's Hospital Orange County ( Orange County , California ) . The study address current limitation prediction early diagnosis anthracycline-induced heart disease . This accomplish follow 3 collaborative core : Core 1 ( Genomics ) focus determine child susceptible treatment-related cardiac toxicity assess gene pathway related anthracycline absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion , well identify gene pathway know important cardiac response injury . Core 2 ( Biomarkers ) explore whether exist novel biomarkers allow accurate diagnosis acute late treatment-related cardiac toxicity . The core use human stem cell platform discovery novel biomarkers anthracycline cardiac damage evaluate clinical cohort . Core 3 ( Cardiac image ) focus evaluation new echocardiographic CMR technique aim early identification cardiac damage anthracycline exposure . It investigate whether change cardiac function immediately anthracycline administration predict patient develop progressive cardiac disease time , explore disease progression longitudinal evaluation innovative echocardiographic parameter remodel dysfunction CCS expose anthracyclines .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ACUTE COHORT : Aged &lt; 18 year time cancer diagnosis Diagnosed new malignancy ( patient history prior malignancy wlil eligible receive anthracycline chemotherapy chest radiation ) Cancer treatment plan require therapy least one dose anthracycline Planned preanthracycline echocardiogram ( ECHO ) recruit site Normal cardiac functioning prior initiation anthracycline therapy ( LV EF &gt; 55 % ) Patients uncooperative ECHO without sedation anesthesia include study . However , patient undergo clinically indicated echocardiogram , echocardiograms add purely research purpose Provision sign informed consent patient and/or patient 's legal guardian Patients previously treat anthracycline chemotherapy radiation chest . Significant congenital heart defect , include patient congenital cardiac abnormality , except patent foramen ovale small ASD . Patients familial cardiomyopathy ( hypertrophic , dilated restrictive ) exclude . SURVIVOR COHORT : Aged &lt; 18 year time cancer diagnosis Previously diagnose cancer currently remission Patients whose prior treatment plan include therapy least one dose anthracycline Patients complete final dose anthracycline least 3 year ago Routinely follow recruit site approximately ever 12 month Exclusion Criteria Prior allogeneic stem cell transplant Significant congenital heart defect , include patient congenital cardiac abnormality , except patent foramen ovale small ASD . Patients familial cardiomyopathy ( hypertrophic , dilated restrictive ) exclude .</criteria>
