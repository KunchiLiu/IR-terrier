	<brief_summary>The goal trial investigate cognitive- brain-mechanisms underlying decision making ( DM ) learn young adult Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) well modulation task-related task-independent brain activation methylphenidate . The study aim use double-blinded , placebo control , cross-over , withdrawal design study effect ADHD methylphenidate behavioural study investigate cognitive effect decision make instrumental learning , functional MRI ( fMRI ) study investigate effect brain mechanisms decision make alone . A secondary objective trial measure effect adult ADHD methylphenidate cerebral perfusion . This do applying novel arterial spin label MRI-technique participant fMRI arm study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The immediate scientific goal trial investigate cognitive- brain-mechanisms underlying Decision Making ( DM ) instrumental learn young adult ADHD well modulation task-related task-independent brain activation MPH . In applied perspective , investigator hope trial contribute development tool improved diagnosis treatment monitoring ADHD . Diagnostic tool base understanding cognitive brain mechanism contribute symptom manifestation ADHD . The study aim use double-blinded , placebo control cross-over withdrawal design study effect ADHD MPH behavioural study investigate cognitive effect DM instrumental learning , fMRI study investigate effect brain mechanism DM alone . The result behavioural DM task fMRI experiment pool data behavioural study achieve high statistical power analysis behavioural data . A distinctive characteristic proposal gain insight difference ADHD-patients healthy control effect methylphenidate ( MPH ) medication approach term `` computational psychiatry '' ( Maia Frank , 2011 ) . In approach , investigator apply mathematical model cognition observe behaviour order derive latent decision variable characterize DM- instrumental learning process . When combined neuroimaging method , computational model allow identification difference affective cognitive process together neurobiological process underlie difference ( Frank et al. , 2004 ) . Such insight foundation new tool diagnosis therapeutic treatment ADHD .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>DrugNa√Øve Group Comply Diagnostic Statistical Manual ( DSM ) IV criterion ADHD . No history medication Methylphenidate . Must age 18 40 . Signed informed consent expect cooperation patient intervention test date must obtain document accord International Conference Harmonisation ( ICH ) Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) , national/local regulation . After stable medication establish , incorporate study follow procedure `` drug group '' . Drug group Comply DSMIV criterion ADHD . On stable treatment MPH . Must age 18 40 . Signed informed consent expect cooperation patient intervention test date must obtain document accord ICH GCP , national/local regulation . Healthy Control Group Must age 18 40 . No current psychiatric diagnosis . Signed informed consent expect cooperation patient intervention test date must obtain document accord ICH GCP , national/local regulation . Treatment follow group pharmacological agent consider exclusion criterion participation : Antidepressants ( MOAinhibitors , Tricyclic antidepressant , Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors ) Antipsychotics ( first second generation ) Anxiolytics/hypnotics ( benzodiazepine , barbiturate ) Opiates History alcohol drug abuse . History moderate severe head injury . Major psychiatric comorbidity ( i.e . psychosis , active suicidal ideation acute exacerbation psychiatric condition need immediate treatment ) . Epilepsy History severe memory loss Under treatment metabolic disorder Severe primary sensory loss Any condition contraindicate treatment methylphenidate automatically lead exclusion , since patient receive methylphenidate clinician thus meet inclusion criterion ( include pregnancy , methylphenidate allergy , incompatible concomitant medication etc. ) . MRI specific criterion : contraindication MRI ( i.e . metallic circuitcontaining implant , severe claustrophobia )</criteria>
