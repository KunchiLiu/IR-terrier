	<brief_title>Safety Immunogenicity 1 2 Doses IPV Latin American Infants Primed With Bivalent OPV Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The world polio eradication effort near goal reduce number new case polio zero . However , final definitive eradication disease require stopping use oral polio vaccine ( OPV 's ) contain live virus rarely revert back disease produce strain . This period result risk polio re-emergence immunity wane vaccine poliovirus still circulate . Inactivated polio vaccine ( IPV ) could potentially play central role process present barrier cost logistics prevent routine use resource limited country , concern exist whether IPV provide enough immunity intestine reduce spread poliovirus communities OPV 's stopped . We plan multi-center trial Latin America administer 1 2 dos IPV child previously vaccinate OPV contain type 1 3 poliovirus ( bOPV ) , assess shed stool type 2 OPV virus administer later . A decrease amount virus shed compare child give IPV would indicate IPV boost intestinal immunity , would suggest spread virus community could reduce use strategy . We also measure impact supplemental IPV 's antibody formation blood , marker protection individual polio disease . A secondary aim compare immunogenicity safety three IPV 's produce different manufacturer . The overall goal inform policy maker polio eradication regard potential role one two dos IPV might play final step toward polio eradication .</detailed_description>
