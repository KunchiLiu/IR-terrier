The IDE G920035 randomize , control trial 1:1 ROBODOC : control randomization . The IDE G000071 randomize , control trial 3:1 ROBODOC : control randomization . B . Selection Criteria Only subject originally enrol IDE G920035 IDE G000071 Clinical Trials eligible participate study . Subjects select study complete minimum 3 month follow-up requirement IDE G920035 IDE G000071 Clinical Trials . Enrolled subject must willing give relevant medical history , undergo focus physical examination operative hip ( ) , AP lateral x-ray take operative hip ( ) complete Harris Hip Score , SF-12 , UCLA Activity Score , VAS pain self-assessment , Western Ontario McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index ( WOMAC ) questionnaires . The study subject may reimburse reasonable travel expense associate participation study . All request reimbursement must pre-approved Curexo Technology Corporation . C. Data Collection Subjects participate study ask visit study site undergo physical examination operative hip ( ) . During visit , ask give relevant medical history , AP lateral radiograph take operative hip ( ) , complete Harris Hip Score , SF-12 , UCLA Activity Score , VAS pain self-assessment , WOMAC questionnaires . If subject obtain AP lateral radiograph within last year , use instead require obtain new radiograph specifically study . If subject unable unwilling come examination , ask fill Harris Hip Score , SF-12 , UCLA Activity Score , VAS pain self-assessment , WOMAC questionnaires via mail phone Study Nurse/Coordinator . Additionally , ask obtain current AP lateral radiograph take operative hip ( ) current orthopaedic surgeon transfer study site . D. Blinding An independent radiologist orthopaedic surgeon , experience read hip x-ray , blind original randomly assign study group , read follow-up x-ray take subject enrol study . E. Randomization There randomization subject study . Prior subject record determine original study group ( ROBODOC manual control ) subject randomly assign IDE G920035 IDE G000071 . F. Baseline Measurements No baseline measurement collect follow-up study . G. Power Sample Size The sample size determine number qualify subject IDE G920035 IDE G000071 Clinical Trials locate agree participate follow-up study . We anticipate approximately 20 patient IDE G920035 30 patient IDE G000071 agree study participation . This sample size provide 82 % power ( α = 0.05 , 2-tailed ) detect 20 % ( 5 versus 2.5 , pool SD = 3.0 ) difference ROBODOC control group VAS last available follow-up .</detailed_description>
