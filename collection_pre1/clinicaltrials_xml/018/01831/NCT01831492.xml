	<detailed_description>The application adequate nutraceuticals sporty people´s performance health become interesting athlete carers . There also great opportunity product provider field act commercially profitable . Beside main goal - achieve improve performance - modern sport nutraceuticals support immunity athlete corner health . One interesting approach field promote performance health via dietary zeolite . Zeolites synthetic microporous crystal contain AIO4 SiO4 tetrahedron . It hypothesize human body silicates act gut-located adsorbent chymus molecule ion-exchangers , catalyst , detergent builder antidiarrheic agent ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) . These - mainly physical - effect dietary use zeolite might also influence chief issue modern sport nutrition : performance , acidosis , oxidative stress , inflammation , gastrointestinal complaint associate impact immunity health . The investigator hypothesize physical effect zeolite affect metabolism gut exert systemic physiological/biochemical benefit regard human´s exercise performance , redox biology , inflammatory process , acid-base balance , even intestinal barrier integrity/function . All postulated benefit would tremendous impact sport performance . However , date clinical study report PubMed address chief aim sport nutrition context zeolite supplementation . GOALS This protocol describe study investigates effect dietary zeolite + dolomite ( Product name : `` PANACEO SPORT '' ) performance , exercise-induced ( acute chronically ) acidosis , oxidative stress , inflammation intestinal barrier dysfunction . This randomized , placebo-controlled , double-blinded , parallel-grouped study design . In detail , investigator want assess effect dietary zeolite + dolomite ( commercially available product `` PANACEO-SPORT '' ) : 1 . Aerobic performance capability maximum oxygen uptake ( primary outcome ) 2 . Lactate kinetics maximum lactate concentration blood ( secondary outcome ) 3 . Oxidative stress ( OS ) /redox biology inflammation ( tertiary outcome ) 4 . Intestinal barrier integrity endotoxemia ( quaternary outcome ) The investigator hypothesize intake product beneficially influence outcome 1-4 ( H1-hypotheses 1-4 : `` Supplementation influence ... '' ) . MERITS study Data project provide knowledge regard effect zeolite dolomite aerobic performance , lactate kinetics , redox biology , inflammation integrity intestinal barrier . Results help u identify support chronically exercise people optimize performance health . METHODS - Subjects : 56 healthy men , non-professional homogeneously train ( &gt; 50ml/kg/min ) triathletes and/or cyclist and/or dual athlete , non-smokers , 20-50 yr , comparable body fat content ( &lt; 20 % ) psycho-physical stress profile , non-medicated , preventive medical check-up actual proofed eligibility conduct sport , pre-selection via telephone interview . - Design : randomize , double-blinded , placebo-controlled , 2-arm parallel-group design . One arm placebo group , second arm receive zeolite + dolomite ( `` PANACEO-SPORT '' ) . After wash-out 4wk food supplement , also specific dietetic drug treatment , period 12wk supplementation placebo follow . At 0wk , 4wk 12wk conduct performance diagnostics . At 0wk 12wk collect blood stool . - Treatment : Subjects receive 6 capsule per day zeolite + dolomite ( `` PANACEO-SPORT '' ) placebo capsule identical appearance . Subjects instruct consume 3 capsule first meal day 3 capsule last meal day . We recommend dispense one box per subject produce 60 box contain 600 capsule ( last 100 day maximum ) . - Surrogate markers/parameters blood stool measure 0wk 12wk . Blood sample collect exercise test . The subject bring sample last stool exercise test ( week 0 12 ) directly exercise physiology laboratory . For blood lactate - context performance diagnostics week 0 , 4 12 - collect capillary earlobe blood , 30 minute post exercise . - Subjects monitor stool appearance via Bristol stool scale/protocol . This conducted week first exercise test 12th week . - Quality life survey conduct running period ( stress profile ) - The week exercise test necessary adhere 4-day diet plan ( last 4 day test ) conduct 7-day food recording . These sanction necessary match carbohydrate , fat , protein micronutrient intake exclude diet-associated biased lactate kinetics . MARKERS/PARAMETERS • Performance diagnostics : maximum performance watt ( Pmax ) , maximum oxygen uptake capacity ( VO2max ) , CO2 exhalation , CO2/O2 ratio , lactate kinetics , maximum lactate , lactate turnpoint 1 ( LTP1 ) , lactate turnpoint 2 ( LTP2 ) anaerobic threshold ( ANS ) , respiratory quotient , EKG cardiocirculatory innocuousness . - Minerals ( serum/plasma ) standard blood chemistry : Mg , Ca , Fe , K , Na , Al , Si , P , Cl , ALT , AST , creatinine , ferritin , transferrin , uric acid , vitamin C , free testosterone , SHBG ( testosterone transporter ) , FAI ( = free androgen index = Testosterone x 100/SHBG ) . - OS/redox biology ( serum/plasma ) : carbonyl protein ( CP ) , F2-isoprostanes , total oxidation status ( TOS ) , proteinogenic antioxidant capacity ( PAOC ) , non-proteinogenic antioxidant capacity ( NPAOC ) , DNA strand break , glutathione peroxidase 3 . - Inflammation/immunity ( blood/serum/plasma ) : TNF-alpha , IL-6 , IL-8 , IL-10 , IL-22 . - Intestinal barrier integrity endotoxemia : Zonulin ( stool ) , claudin1 claudin2 ( stool ) , lipopolysaccharides ( blood ) , toll-like receptor ( TLR2 TLR4 blood ) , gut profile `` basis '' ( kind number colony , Calprotectin , α1-antitrypsin etc ) . - Body fat determination distribution via lipometry ( non-invasive ) week 0 14 . BLOOD SAMPLING • Week 0 : At rest , 4wk wash-out 1st performance diagnostics - Week 12 : At rest , 12wk 3rd performance diagnostics - Capillary blood earlobe determine lactate drawn , exercise week 0 , 4 12 : step exercise 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 20 30 min post exercise evaluate recovery lactate kinetics . STOOL SAMPLING - Week 0 : At rest , 4 wk wash-out 1st performance diagnostics - Week 12 : At rest , 3rd performance diagnostics PROTOCOLS/QUESTIONNAIRES • Stool protocol conduct week 1st 3rd performance test • Food habit document food record diet plan last week prior exercise test , week 0 , 4 12 - Exercise training habit evaluate sport scientist via interview performance test - Psycho-social well-being stress perception evaluate `` Quality Life-BREF '' questionnaire ( SF36 ) 1st 3rd performance test PERFORMANCE DIAGNOSTIC ( PD ) PD cycle-steptest-ergometry performance/watt maximum , lactate maximum VO2max.. After 3 min rest cycle ergometer , subject start exercise another 3 min warm 60 watt . Then increase exercise intensity 15 watt per min ( constant 80 rpm ) exhaustion/VO2max . After reach exhaustion/VO2max , candidate continue perform low intensity ( 30 % Pmax ) 30 minute observe recovery lactate kinetics . All test supervise physician sport scientist . Before test , volunteer also check physician . PD conduct : • Week 0 : 1st performance diagnostics = last selection candidate ( detailed medical check , standard blood chemistry panel ) • Week 4 : 2nd performance diagnostics • Week 12 : 3rd last performance diagnostics LIPOMETRY - Week 0 : At rest , 4wk wash-out 1st performance diagnostics - Week 12 : At rest , 12wk supplementation 3rd performance diagnostics SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION &amp; RANDOMIZATION Sample size calculation base expectation 8 % increase performance capability ( watt ) 4 week treatment zeolite + dolomite ( `` PANACEO-SPORT '' ) , compare placebo ( change ) . The investigator expect average Pmax 345 watt train cohort , standard deviation 10 % , chose power 80 % 2-arm design ( 1:1 distribution placebo/verum ) . This calculation reveal number 50 subject . Drawing account drop rate 10 % , recommend sample size 56 subject , 28 group . Subjects randomized block 4 ( 2 verum 2 placebo block ) sequentially number ( www.randomization.com ) . To guarantee balance distribution performance capability/VO2max group ( verum vs. placebo ) conduct stratification via VO2max rank statistic . The allocation capsules/boxes conduct complete 1st exercise test session . Boxes deliver mail 2 tranche ( 7 block 28 subject ) , separate week . This scheme consider one week period check 28 subject therefore ensure equal duration treatment candidate . STATISTICAL ANALYSES For blood stool data use univariate , two-factorial analysis variance ( ANOVA ) . Factors : `` treatment '' ( = placebo v product ) `` time '' ( = week 0 v week 12 ) . For lactate performance diagnostic parameter use three-factorial repeated measure ANOVA additional factor `` session '' ( test 1 , 2 , 3 ) . This statistical test method ensure consideration before- , during- after- measurement . Further , use non-parametric test , descriptive statistic , - indicate - correlation analysis .</detailed_description>
