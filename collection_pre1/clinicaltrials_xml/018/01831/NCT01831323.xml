	<brief_title>Evaluation Metabolome Diverticular Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence diverticular disease colon increase last year . Since present potentially severe complication ( term morbidity mortality ) , recent study focus underlie mechanism therapeutic option . Diverticular disease colon present important etiopathogenetic event . The first severity microscopic inflammation correlate disease activity . The second bacterial overgrowth observe colon , diverticula form `` recess '' bacteria proliferate . The third `` metabolome '' play important role pathogenesis diseases gastrointestinal tract ( ) . An extensive combination microbial specie live permanently human gut participate metabolic activity gastro-intestinal tract ( synthesis certain vitamin , improvement immune system , balance resident bacterial specie ) . There little publish clinical evidence suggest direct link microbiota diverticular disease ; however , alter microbiota flora patient colon cancer , irritable bowel syndrome , IBD describe . It clear human metabolism inflammatory response influence genetic information outside genome . Insights influence microorganism pathogenesis gastrointestinal function diverticular disease infancy often rely extrapolation disease state . Microbiological analysis fecal microbiota provide important information role microbial-mammalian axis might pathogenesis diverticular disease . Alteration metabolome play important role pathology gastrointestinal tract , Inflammatory Bowel Diseases ( IBD ) Irritable Bowel Syndrome ( IBS ) . Most likely , plays role diverticular disease . In fact , current western diet poor fiber cause alteration resident bacterial specie , reduction bifidobacteria increase clostridia . This alteration might present diverticular disease manipulation microbial flora might represent treatment option diverticular disease prevention complication . Recent study show treatment probiotic help reduce activity index patient DDS well reduce recurrence disease . A new method validate assess microbiota : analysis faecal urinary metabolome high resolution Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ( NMR ) spectroscopy . The microbioma combination DNA microorganism compose intestinal microflora ( microbiota ) . Metabolomics allow assess metabolic activity microbiota possible interaction host . The metabolomic analysis stool urine offer new approach evaluate metabolome diverticular disease , compare patient take probiotic , fiber , non-absorbable antibiotic anti-inflammatory drug .</detailed_description>
