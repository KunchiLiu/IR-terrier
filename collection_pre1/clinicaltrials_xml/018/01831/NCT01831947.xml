	<brief_summary>This clinical trial investigates impact intravitreal injection Ranibizumab antibody acuteness vision . Patients include suffer choroidal neo-vascularization ( CNV ) consequence age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) . Initially , patient get injection 0.5 mg Ranibizumab monthly interval 3 month . Subsequently , one group get Ranibizumab interval 2 month , whereas second group treat demand . The primary end point study change best-corrected visual acuity 12 month . Secondary end point include impact Ranibizumab morphological change retina , number patient gain loss 15 letter visual acuity 12 month , change quality life number injection require first 12 month treatment .</brief_summary>
