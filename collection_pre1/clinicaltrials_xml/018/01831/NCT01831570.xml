	<brief_summary>Introduction Osteoarthritis chronic disease characterize progressive degradation articular cartilage . Hand OA involve symptomatically 1 million subject France ( i.e. , painful functional impairment ) . To date , treatment OA symptomatic drug able stop degradative process cartilage . 50 % patient hand OA exhibit functional impairment responsible severe handicap , almost similar rheumatoid arthritis . While risk factor hand OA well identify ( i.e. , familial history , female sex , menopause , obesity ) , clinical outcome large cohort poorly know . In addition , investigator miss predictive clinical , biological imaging factor severe clinical ( i.e . pain , functional impairment aesthetic damage ) structural evolution ( i.e. , aggravation radiographic score ) . Primary objective To investigate hand OA patient predictive clinical , biological , genetic imaging factor clinical aggravation 6 year follow-up . Secondary objective To investigate hand OA patient predictive clinical , biological , genetic imaging factor clinical aggravation 3 year follow-up . To investigate hand OA patient predictive clinical , biological , genetic imaging factor clinical aggravation 3 year follow-up . To investigate whether variation clinical evaluation hand hand OA radiographic structural change associate correlated inclusion 3 year follow-up inclusion 6 year follow-up To investigate whether clinical status radiographic alteration correlate inclusion To determine whether hand OA associate OA site hand disease ( carpal tunnel syndrome , tendinitis ) To evaluate frequency erosive hand OA among whole hand OA cohort inclusion , 3 6 year follow-up To identify clinical , biological , genetic imaging factor associate erosive hand OA ( versus non erosive hand OA ) inclusion follow ( 3 6 year ) To investigate predictive clinical , biological , genetic imaging factor clinical radiographic aggravation 3 6 year follow-up erosive hand OA subgroup Methods : investigator plan include 500 patient cohort ( 5/week ) 7 visit ( one per year ) plan : M0 , M12 , M24 , M36 , M48 , M60 M72 . A clinical evaluation hand OA perform visit . At visit M0 , M36 M72 , hand radiograph radiograph OA localisation ( symptomatic ) perform . A blood sample take inclusion biomarker study genetic investigation . A blood sample take M36 M72 build prospective serum collection . Duration study : 8.5 year 2.5 year inclusion period Duration study one patient : 6 year Recruitment Rheumatology Department Saint-Antoine Hospital multicentric international steer committee Potential outcome : - Identification clinical , radiological biological tool useful predict clinical structural outcome - Description history course hand OA predictive factor severe evolution ( i.e . erosive form hand OA ) To integrate daily practice , clinical radiological tool allow standardized follow hand OA patient .</brief_summary>
