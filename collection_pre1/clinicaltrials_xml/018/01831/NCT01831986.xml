	<brief_summary>Schizophrenia ( SZ ) schizoaffective ( SA ) disorder comprise several debilitating symptom . It suggest compound neuroprotective effect might useful management SZ/SA symptom . Our previous clinical trial indicate significant beneficial effect augmentation two different neuroprotective agent : Pregnenolone L-Theanine . Pregnenolone ( PREG ) neurosteroid , display multiple effect central nervous system . Our recent 8-week , randomize , double-blind trial among patient chronic SZ/SA disorder , PREG versus placebo DHEA add antipsychotic , yield encouraging result : PREG augmentation demonstrate significant amelioration positive symptom , EPS , well improvement attention , work memory performance SZ/SA disorder patient ( Ritsner et al 2010 ) . L-Theanine unique amino acid present almost exclusively tea plant . It possess neuroprotective , mood-enhancing , relaxation activity . L-theanine augmentation antipsychotic therapy ameliorate positive , activation , anxiety symptom SZ/SA disorder patient ( grant # 06TGF-911 , ( Ritsner et al 2010 ) . This propose study would extend prior research Pregnenolone L-theanine combine agent versus placebo . We hypothesize addition compound ongoing antipsychotic would significantly improve clinical status SZ/SA patient . Methods : In 8-week , randomize , double-blind placebo-controlled trial combination PREG ( 50 mg/day ) L-theanine ( 400 mg/day ) versus placebo add stable ongoing antipsychotic treatment 200 patient schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder . This trial conduct five site Israel . Participants assess baseline 2 , 4 , 6 8 week treatment . A battery research instrument use assessment psychopathology , side effect , general functioning quality life</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This two-year randomized placebo-controlled double-blind investigation augmentation PREG L-theanine management patient SZ/SA . The study consist two phase : 2-week continued stability ( lead ) phase 8-week double-blind treatment phase . In lead-in phase , patient receive antipsychotic medication remain maintenance regimen least two week . Clinical stability define two consecutive weekly CGI rating change score , 20 % change PANSS total score . The treatment phase 8-week parallel group , placebo-controlled , double-blind trial adjunctively administer PREG L-theanine placebo . Assignment PREG L-theanine placebo random , stratify ( i.e. , FGAs/SGAs , inpatient/outpatient ) basis . PREG ( 50 mg/day ) L-theanine ( 400 mg/day ) placebo administer divided dos form capsule . If patient relapse treatment phase study , patient remove study . All attempt make obtain end-of-study rating . If measure obtain , four- six-week data , collect prior relapse , informative . Patients fulfill entry criterion enter 8-week double-blind treatment phase study . Assignment PREG L-theanine placebo random , stratify ( i.e. , conventional/new generation antipsychotic treatment , inpatient/outpatient ) basis . PREG ( 50 mg/day ) L-theanine ( 400 mg/day ) /placebo administer divided dos form white capsule . If patient relapse treatment phase study , patient remove study . All attempt make obtain end-of-study rating . If measure obtain , four- eight-week data , collect prior relapse , informative . Subjects assess baseline 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 week treatment use psychiatric rating scale , self-report questionnaire . Neurobiological ( plasma cortisol , PREG , dehydroepiandrosterone , BDNF biologically active molecule ) immunological ( pro-inflammatory cytokine others ) test conduct baseline , treatment . The efficacy safety augment antipsychotic treatment PREG L-theanine analyze .</detailed_description>
