	<brief_summary>This study adults adolescent type 1 diabetes . The purpose study learn investigational system measure blood glucose . This system require blood drawn body , require glucose sensor worn skin ( subcutaneously ) . This device instead estimate blood glucose level shin infrared light skin use sophisticated statistical analysis light bounce back get absorb ( spectral data ) . The researcher study compare accuracy new device glucose measurement device already approve FDA , include glucose meter subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) sensor . Information learn study use development tool manage diabetes .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Performance Evaluation Non-Invasive Glucose Monitor Compared CGM Data Acquired iPro2</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate utility novel approach non-invasive glucose sensing . The test patient include fingerstick alternate site capillary blood measurement take nearly simultaneously series near-infrared spectra collect via novel , proprietary fiber-optic probe . Simultaneously , subject wear commercial continuous glucose measure system ( Medtronic iPro 2 ) . The spectral data convert prediction tissue glucose use proprietary pre-defined universal algorithm . Subjects test every 20 minute 12 hour per day 6 visit per patient period 4 month .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Are age 1275 year Have diagnose type 1 diabetes mellitus Use insulin treat diabetes Agree able follow study plan describe informed consent form . Are pregnant woman nurse mother Have skin condition could cause problem wear glucose sensor abdomen ( stomach area ) and/or spectral data measure forearm noninvasive device . Are currently take part another clinical study Have take part study Have experience severe hypoglycemia ( episode low blood sugar unable treat e.g. , seizure , coma , unconsciousness ) time within past six month Have additional condition ( ) Investigator 's opinion would warrant exclusion study prevent complete study</criteria>
