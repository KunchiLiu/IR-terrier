	<brief_summary>There paucity data aetiology myeloproliferative neoplasm ( MPNs ) . The investigator conduct systematic review literature identify several cohort case-control study investigate wide range potential medical , environmental occupational risk factor . However , study limit wide variation case definition small sample size limit potential detect modest risk difference case control . The research group propose exploratory case-control study 100 patient classic MPNs 200 control determine optimal method roll study multi-centred UK-based case-control study investigate aetiology MPN subtypes . The objective study evaluate recruitment procedure , response rate , development telephone administer questionnaire , compare occupational exposure assessment use OccIDEAS , novel web base program , job-exposure matrix ( FINJEM ) , evaluate feasibility collection DNA saliva compare blood sample , identify potential aetiologic factor associate MPNs explore assessment quality life .
