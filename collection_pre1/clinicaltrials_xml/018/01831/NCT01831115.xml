	<brief_title>Basics Acute Shortness Breath EvaLuation ( BASEL V ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Acute heart failure common disease associate high morbidity mortality . Unfortunately , pathophysiology optimal initial treatment ill define . Working Hypothesis : - Improved understanding pathophysiology underlie heart failure might allow cause-specific treatment syndrome . - More rapid diagnosis acute heart failure may allow rapidly initiate appropriate treatment . - Cardiac dysfunction especially comorbid dyspneic patient adequately characterize spectrum acute heart failure diverse originally think . Methods : This large multicenter center , observational study enrol unselected , consecutive patient acute dyspnea present Emergency Department . Patient history , physical examination laboratory parameter systematically obtain . Echocardiographic examination routinely perform . Follow-up do specify interval ( 3 , 6 12 month ) initial presentation risk predictor analyze multivariable regression model . Expected Value Proposed Project : The data obtain project help improve diagnostics prognostic patient acute dyspnea good understand underlie pathology cardiac dysfunction cohort . Significance : The study aim up-to-date deal important health care problem society . Conclusions draw significantly change care patient acute heart failure probably lead significant reduction rehospitalization , morbidity mortality .</detailed_description>
