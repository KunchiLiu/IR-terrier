	<brief_summary>The Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium ( BCSC ) database contain data 1994-2009 breast cancer screening , quality , outcomes , main goal advance breast cancer research . This project fund maintain BCSC database share data investigator . Our objective : - Maintain BCSC pool database use secure method protect confidentiality woman , radiologist , facility , BCSC registries ; - Encourage facilitate share BCSC research resource , continue develop implement communication plan expand resource dissemination ; - Provide statistical scientific expertise researcher , distribute customize limited datasets , analyze BCSC data ; - Develop support new web-based dynamic query tool electronic interface efficiently share aggregated BCSC data public .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The BCSC collaboration breast image registry formally establish 1994 support National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) . As BCSC SCC , coordinate standardize data collection , pool data registry , develop statistical methodology , conduct statistical analysis research project , share data within beyond consortium . The current BCSC database consist data collect five active mammography registry two inactive registry : - Carolina Mammography Registry North Carolina ( CMR ) - Group Health Registry Seattle , Washington ( GHC ) - New Hampshire Mammography Network ( NHMN ) - San Francisco Mammography Registry ( SFMR ) - Vermont Breast Cancer Surveillance System ( VBCSS ) - New Mexico Mammography Project Albuquerque ( NMMP ) - Colorado Mammography Advocacy Project ( CMAP ) These registry actively collect data since 1994 1996 ( depend registry ) include patient risk factor , clinical history , breast-imaging procedure ( screen diagnostic ) , benign malignant pathology result , cancer outcome , vital status , radiologist characteristic , facility information . Some registry data go back 1970s ; however , information mostly use determine prior breast cancer diagnose mammography exposure . Most analysis limit data 1994 forward . Registry procedure : BCSC data share use 4 main approach : 1 . Completed deidentified datasets summary statistic make publicly available internet . 2 . A web-based data query tool automatically create user-specified completely deidentified data set summary statistic . 3 . Customized data set create Statistical Coordinating Center ( SCC ) deliver investigator use secure method , BCSC steer committee approval research proposal . 4 . Statistical analysis perform SCC , BCSC steer committee approval research proposal . Quality factor : The data use BCSC previously collect directly BCSC registry . The BCSC database personal identifier name , phone number , address , social security number one population contact additional data collection . The data set contains HIPAA limit identifier : date , age &gt; 89 , ZIP cod . It possible new data collect contract determine BCSC Steering Committee . This could include correction current data , update exist data element ( e.g. , additional radiology data , updated cancer vital status outcome ) , new data element ( i.e. , information advance imaging modality , cancer biomarkers ) . New data contain personal identifier . Individual-level data never share unless rigorously examine approve Steering Committee ( include principal investigator BCSC site ) appropriate IRB safeguard place . Our major objective contract maintain current high standard BCSC database interruption service scientific community . We continue resource research community , provide scientific statistical expertise conduct high-quality statistical analysis advance breast cancer research . We expand outreach dissemination , investigator aware valuable resource use research . Our second objective develop new electronic interface publicly available datasets meet high possible standard caBIGÂ® compatibility . This facilitate efficient share BCSC data expand potential collaboration , increase value broad research community . Our ultimate aim facilitate research improve breast cancer screen reduces cancer burden mortality .</detailed_description>
