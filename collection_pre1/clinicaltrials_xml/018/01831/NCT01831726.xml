	<brief_title>Dovitinib Patients With Tumor Pathway Activations Inhibited Dovitinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II , open label study determine efficacy safety treatment dovitinib ( TKI258 ) patient diagnosis select solid tumor hematological malignancy pre-identified ( prior study consent ) mutation , translocation amplification whose disease progress standard treatment . Genomic profile become accessible patient physician . As , patient identify potentially-actionable mutation , translocation amplification access target drug treatment . This signal-seeking study match patient tumor pathway activation inhibit dovitinib RTK inhibitor dovitinib . Pre-identification mutation , translocation , amplification perform locally CLIA certify laboratory prior participation trial . For purpose study , genomic profiling consider part screen . Informed consent must sign screening activity take place . Once eligibility ( screen criterion meet ) confirm Novartis , patient initiate therapy dovitinib single-agent . The patient may receive additional anti-cancer therapy treatment dovitinib . Patients receive study treatment disease progression ( assessed investigator per RECIST 1.1 appropriate hematologic response criterion ) , unacceptable toxicity , death discontinuation study treatment reason ( e.g. , withdrawal consent , start new anti-neoplastic therapy discretion investigator ) , otherwise known End Treatment . All patient discontinue study treatment due disease progression must progression clearly document . Disease assessment ( RECIST 1.1 appropriate hematological response criterion ) perform every 8 week ( ±4 day ) first dose study drug ( Day 1 every odd cycle ) , disease progression end treatment , whichever occur first . The frequency disease assessment may reduce every 12 week patient least 4 post-baseline disease assessment clinically stable ( except AML patient ) . Scans assess locally investigator . After discontinuation treatment , patient , regardless reason treatment discontinuation , follow safety 30 day last dose . All patient follow survival status every 3 month 2 year last patient enrol study , regardless treatment discontinuation reason ( except consent withdrawn patient lose follow-up )</detailed_description>
