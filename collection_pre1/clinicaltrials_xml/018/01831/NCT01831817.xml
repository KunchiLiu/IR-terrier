	<criteria>Participants 18 55 year age , good general health , preexist selfreported clinically diagnose tooth sensitivity require entry study . Participants require least four teeth facial/cervical erosion , abrasion and/or gingival recession respond qualify evaporative ( air ) assessment Screening visit least two teeth ( incisor , canine premolar ) demonstrate sign sensitivity , measure qualify tactile threshold ( Yeaple ≤ 20 gram ( g ) ) evaporative ( air ) ( Schiff Sensitivity Score ≥ 2 ) assessment Baseline visit . Specific Dentition Exclusions Test teeth 1 . Tooth evidence current recent caries , report treatment decay 12 month Screening . 2 . Tooth exposed dentin deep , defective facial restoration , teeth use abutment fix removable partial denture , teeth full crown veneer , orthodontic band crack enamel . Sensitive teeth contribute etiology erosion , abrasion recession expose dentin . 3 . Sensitive tooth expect respond treatment overthecounter dentifrice opinion investigator Use sensitivity dentifrice within 8 week screen Individuals require antibiotic prophylaxis dental procedure</criteria>
