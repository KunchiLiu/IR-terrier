	<brief_summary>The overall objective evaluate treatment neck-specific exercise program cognitive behavioural approach improve outcome compare prescribe , self-mediated progressive physical activity patient cervical radiculopathy . There lack evidence best treatment patient category . Many patient sick-listed long period time different kind treatment approach without treatment . The present study could fill identify knowledge gap strengthen currently weak scientific evidence treatment patient category . The long-term effect study could reduce time sick leave improve rate patient return work and/ former activity optimise treatment . Further , decrease number patient finally surgery neck problem thus reduce mental , physical social cost .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients cervical radiculopathy neck- arm pain , neurological change , activity limitation difficulty return work . The current scientific evidence lack randomise control trial compare surgery conservative treatment well evaluate different conservative intervention . Most patient candidate surgery sick-listed long time different treatment approach without treatment . The purpose evaluate treatment neck-specific training cognitive behavioral approach improve outcome compare prescribed physical activity . Methods : A randomized control trial include 144 patient compare intervention neck specific train cognitive behavioural approach intervention prescribe physical activity . The intervention lead experienced specialise physiotherapist last 14 week . Main outcome variable pain intensity ( VAS scale ) accompany assessment impairment subjective health measurement undertaken intervention 3 , 6 , 12 24 month . Implementation : The result present scientifically well popularly publication professional meeting . Active implementation strategy change physiotherapist treatment behaviour use . The best method chosen survey physiotherapist treat patient current study regard experience , education organisational context .</detailed_description>
