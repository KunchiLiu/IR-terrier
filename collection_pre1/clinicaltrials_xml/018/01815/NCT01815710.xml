	<brief_summary>An Ontario-wide study identify best strategy promote uptake high quality , expert develop Clinical Pathways ( CPs ) within Emergency Departments . The investigator work 16 Community EDs across Ontario ) tailor implementation strategy work ED , ii ) assist implementation one pediatric emergency CP ( Asthma Gastroenteritis ) site , iii ) evaluate impact health professional , patient outcome economic cost . The investigator conduct 3.5 - year mixed method health service research project four study objective : 1 ) design theory-based knowledge user-informed intervention strategy successfully implement two provincial pediatric emergency clinical pathway practice community Emergency Departments ( EDs ) ; 2 ) evaluate effectiveness implementation strategy ; 3 ) conduct process evaluation ass implementation strategy ; 4 ) conduct economic analysis evaluate implementation cost benefit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To meet first objective , use Michie 's Theoretical Domains Framework ( TDF ) identify organize CP-relevant behaviour . We conduct qualitative interview , guide TDF involve knowledge user participate site , identify barrier facilitator change relevant propose CP implementation . Experience implementation initiative also use guide intervention . An intervention mapping technique use select organize appropriate strategy affect behaviour change . Further input seek knowledge user site partner . The intervention begin site visit ass readiness adoption , infrastructure requirement , ability implement pathway . To meet objective two , use cluster randomize control trial ( RCT ) design , measurement relevant clinical process outcomes 16 community EDs Ontario . Using balanced incomplete block design , study implementation intervention two clinical pathway : ) Asthma ii ) Vomiting &amp; Diarrhea ( V &amp; D ) . We recruit randomize 16 community EDs receive intervention one CPs serve control alternate pathway . Primary clinical outcome CP include follow : ) Asthma : proportion asthmatic patient moderate severe exacerbation receive steroid within 60 minute ED presentation ; ii ) V &amp; D : proportion child mild moderate dehydration treat oral rehydration therapy . The primary process outcome measure presence appropriately complete CP , per pre-defined criterion , chart relevant patient . Secondary clinical outcome include disease-specific treatment , ED length stay , revisit hospitalization . Secondary process outcome include CP use base shift-level data relate busyness ED . A mixed method evaluation use assess clinical process outcome . Data source include chart audit , administrative database , environmental scan knowledge user interview . Sample size calculation primary process outcome yield high number require chart . A total sample size 6400 patient chart require detect absolute difference 12 % control intervention hospital use two-sided test 5 % level significance . To meet objective three , process log use track progress site deadline target , implementation issue , degree uptake , local adaptation adherence . And finally , meet objective four , comparison CP implementation health care cost do patient Asthma V &amp; D pre post implementation phase site . Additional cost outcomes synthesized incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) compare intervention control sit . Cost-effectiveness analysis ( CEAs ) do relate ICERs primary clinical outcome CP .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Selecting 149 community EDs Ontario , recruit EDs CP place either Pediatric Asthma Pediatric V &amp; D . To minimize contamination site , request data Health Force Ontario , organization assist physician coverage different EDs , ensure ED physician work one study site . An additional inclusion criterion commitment implementation intervention administrative lead behalf hospital . Specific inclusion/exclusion criterion use patient define CP . Medical record department site ask pull relevant chart , use International Statistical Classification Diseases Related Health Problems ( ICD ) 10 code diagnosis related index condition ( Asthma V &amp; D ) define study period . In experience , approach work successfully community ED study . Chart auditor review record ensure eligibility criterion meet . All retrieve eligible patient chart audit .</criteria>
