	<brief_summary>Background aim : Ultrasound-guided ( USG ) nerve block sciatic nerve ( popliteal level = PL ) saphenous nerve ( mid-femoral level = MFL ) provide analgesia follow leg surgery . Traditionally two separate injection perform . The aim describe novel , fast USG block combination require one skin penetration block sciatic saphenous nerve ; i.e . SPEDI block = Single PEnetration Dual Injection . Methods : A randomized , control double-blinded trial . Following ethic committee approval 60 patient randomized administration USG SPEDI block compare two separate USG block saphenous ( MFL ) sciatic ( PL ) nerve . Blocks perform induction general anaesthesia . Outcome measure performance time ( primary outcome measure ) , Post-Anaesthesia Care Unit pain score ( VAS score 0-10 ) , block difficulty level ( easy , middle , difficult ) , opioid consumption ( PACU ) , serum-ropivacaine pharmacokinetics ( blood sample 0-180 minute ) . Both block combination evaluate MR imaging ( MRI ) . Hypothesis : The USG SPEDI block combination expect perform significantly faster without move leg , achieve successful perioperative pain management . The SPEDI block may find important use emergency setting .</brief_summary>
