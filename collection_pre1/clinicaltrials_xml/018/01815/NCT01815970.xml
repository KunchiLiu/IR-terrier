	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) fourth lead cause death world-wide . Dyspnea ( i.e. , sensation breathlessness ) hallmark symptom patient disease . Pulmonary rehabilitation program incorporate exercise training remain effective non-pharmacological method reduce dyspnea COPD , however understood exercise training relieve dyspnea .

	<brief_title>Does Pulmonary Rehabilitation Improve Breathing COPD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine 8 week pulmonary rehabilitation reduce neuromechanical uncoupling ( disparity effort/drive breathe breathing response ) patient COPD determine reduction associate improvement intensity qualitative dimension dyspnea exercise . Pulmonary rehabilitation exercise education intervention design help patient cope dyspnea , exercise effectively . Pulmonary rehabilitation program incorporate exercise training effective non-pharmacological method reduce dyspnea COPD . However , precise mechanism dyspnea relief follow exercise training still unknown . Understanding pathophysiologcal underpinnings debilitate symptom critical order develop effective symptom-based strategy dyspnea management . Participants COPD report exercise laboratory 3 separate visit . Visit 1 serve initial screen visit whereby participant provide write informed consent prior familiarization test procedure symptom scale follow completion incremental cycle exercise test . The remain 2 experimental visit conduct immediately 8 week pulmonary rehabilitation . Visits 2 3 include : symptom-related questionnaire , pulmonary function test , functional ability test constant-work rate ( CWR ) cycle exercise test 75 % maximal work rate achieve visit 1 . The CWR cycle exercise test perform instrumentation esophageal catheter detail physiological sensory measurement obtain visit . The comparison data visit 2 3 address investigator ' hypothesis . Study Participants : The study include 12 COPD participant total . Pulmonary Rehabilitation : The pulmonary rehabilitation program provide education exercise training patient chronic lung disease assist symptom management improve daily ability function . The 8 week program involve 3 visit per week 2 hour visit ( 1 hour education 1 hour exercise training ) . The pulmonary rehabilitation program usual care participant study . Exercise Protocol : A symptom-limited incremental exercise test perform visit 1 use electronically brake cycle ergometer accord recommend guideline . The test consist steady-state rest 10 minute , 1 minute warm-up 0 watt , 10 watt stepwise increase work rate every minute symptom-limitation . The CWR test perform visit 2 3 consist 1 minute warm-up follow increase work rate 75 % maximum incremental work rate . Measurements Pulmonary Function : Spirometry , plethysmography , diffuse capacity , maximum respiratory pressure perform visit 1 accord standard recommendation . Visits 2 3 include spirometry , plethysmography , maximum respiratory pressure . A commercially available cardiopulmonary testing system ( Vmax 229d Autobox 6,200 DL ; SensorMedics , Yorba Linda , CA ) use , measurement express percent predict normal value . Dyspnea Evaluation : Dyspnea intensity ( define `` sensation labour difficult breathing '' ) perceive leg discomfort evaluate rest , every minute exercise , peak exercise use modify 10-point Borg scale test visit . Participants ask describe dyspnea exercise prior intensity rating end-exercise use follow 3 descriptor : ( 1 ) `` breathe require work effort '' ( work effort ) ; ( 2 ) `` I get enough air '' ( unsatisfied inspiration ) ; ( 3 ) `` I get enough air '' ( unsatisfied expiration ) . None 3 descriptor choose one time . Upon exercise cessation , participant ask verbalize main reason ( ) stop exercise ( i.e. , breathe discomfort , leg discomfort , combination breathe leg , reason ) select qualitative descriptor breathlessness use establish questionnaire . Pre- post-intervention change dyspnea also assess Transition Dyspnea Index . Cardio-respiratory Responses Exercise : Standard cardio-respiratory measure record breath-by-breath basis average 30-second epoch , include minute ventilation ( V ' E ) , oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) , carbon dioxide production ( CO2 ) , partial pressure end-tidal CO2 , ( tidal volume ) VT , breathe frequency ( Vmax 229d Autobox 6,200 DL ; SensorMedics , Yorba Linda , CA ) . Operating volume ( i.e. , end-expiratory end-inspiratory lung volume ) derive dynamic inspiratory capacity ( IC ) manoeuvre previously describe 26 . For safety purpose , electrocardiography monitor use 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , blood pressure measure use manual sphygmomanometer , arterial oxygen saturation monitor use pulse oximetry . Exercise test terminate base establish criterion per American College Sports Medicine guideline . Respiratory Mechanics : Diaphragmatic electromyography ( EMGdi ) measure use multi-pair electrode catheter combine two balloon measure esophageal gastric pressure . Lidocaine spray gel ( local anaesthetic ) use freeze participant 's nose back throat . After , participant sip water straw , experience technician insert catheter participant nose stomach via esophagus . The catheter position base strength EMGdi signal spontaneous breathing . The raw EMGdi signal convert root mean square ( RMS ) . The maximum RMS inspiration determine QRS complex avoid influence ECG artefact 30 . Maximal EMGdi ( EMGdimax ) obtain IC , sniff maximal inspiratory pressure manoeuvre . The ratio EMGdi EMGdimax use index neural respiratory drive . The ratio VT vital capacity ( VC ) use represent mechanical response respiratory system . Normalizing EMGdimax VC allow stimulus intensity standardize compare across individual . Thus neuromechanical uncouple respiratory system determine ratio ( interaction ) neural drive mechanical response respiratory system ( EMGdi/EMGdimax : VT/VC ) . The mechanical work breathing ( WOB ) determine use modify Campbell diagram use previously . Chest wall compliance obtain literature position previously describe . The WOB partition resistive elastic component . This data compare WOB data previous COPD study . Muscle oxygenation hemodynamics : Muscle oxygenation noninvasively monitor use near infrared spectroscopy . A four-channel continuous-wave near-infrared spectroscope ( Oxymon M III , Artinis Medical Systems , BV , The Netherlands ) use determine oxyhemoglobin , deoxyhemoglobin , total hemoglobin measure light attenuation 760 864 nm wavelength , analyze use algorithm base modify Beer-Lambert law . This data use descriptive exploratory purpose limit data exists muscle oxygenation leg ( vastus lateralis ) respiratory muscle ( sternocleidomastoid , parasternal , intercostal ) COPD patient . Inflection Point VT V ' E Relationship : VT data average 30-second epoch plot V ' E rest throughout exercise intensity individual participant . The point VT deviate linearity begin plateau define inflection point VT V ' E relationship . Two different observer determine inflection point participant incremental exercise test examine individual Hey plot . Statistical Analysis : Data present mean ± SD unless otherwise specify . Pre post-pulmonary rehabilitation descriptive characteristic , exercise response , Borg rating standardize evaluation point ( 10 watt increment , VT/V ' E inflection , peak ) compare use pair t-tests Bonferroni correction appropriate . Pearson correlation coefficient use examine association measure variable : neuromechanical uncoupling , breathe pattern , operational lung volume , Borg rating , exercise variable . Reasons stop exercise qualitative descriptor dyspnea analyzed frequency statistic compare pre post pulmonary rehabilitation use McNemar 's exact test standardize 10 watt increment work-rate , VT/V ' E inflection , peak exercise . A P-value le 0.05 regard statistically significant . Statistical analysis data perform use Stata v11.2 ( StataCorp , Texas , USA ) .</detailed_description>
