	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose genetically modify T-cells follow peripheral blood stem cell transplant treat patient recurrent high-risk non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Giving chemotherapy stem cell transplant help stop growth cancer cell . When healthy stem cell donor infused patient may help patient 's bone marrow make stem cell , red blood cell , white blood cell , platelet . Sometimes transplanted cell donor make immune response body 's normal cell . Removing T cell donor cell transplant may stop happen . Giving infusion donor 's T cell ( donor lymphocyte infusion ) later may help patient 's immune system see remain cancer cell belong patient 's body destroy ( call graft-versus-tumor effect )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety describe full toxicity profile cellular immunotherapy utilize ex vivo expand autologous central memory T cell ( Tcm ) -enriched T cell genetically modify use self-inactivating ( SIN ) lentiviral vector express costimulatory cluster differentiation ( CD ) 19-specific chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) well truncate human epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) ( CD19R : CD28 zeta/EGFR tau +Tcm ) ( CD19-CAR-specific/truncated EGFR lentiviral vector-transduced autologous T cell ) conjunction standard myeloablative autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) patient high-risk intermediate grade B-lineage non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( e.g. , diffuse large B-cell lymphoma [ DLBCL ] , mantle cell lymphoma [ MCL ] transform non-Hodgkin lymphoma [ NHL ] ) . II . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) base dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine tempo , magnitude , duration engraftment transfer T cell product relate number cell infuse . II . To study impact therapeutic intervention development normal CD19+ B-cell precursor peripheral blood surrogate vivo effector function transfer autologous CD19R : CD28 zeta/EGFR tau +Tcm . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study CD19-CAR-specific/truncated EGFR lentiviral vector-transduced autologous T cell . Patients undergo mobilization autologous stem cell collection cytoreductive chemotherapy filgrastim and/or plerixafor per current standard operating policy . Patients undergo myeloablative conditioning regimen per institutional standard begin day -7 follow hematopoietic stem cell transplantation day 0 . Patients receive CD19-CAR-specific/truncated EGFR lentiviral vector-transduced autologous T cell IV day 2 3 ( may delay day 45 patient yet eligible ) . Patients experience disease progression experience DLTs great equal 100 day post HSCT allow receive optional second T cell infusion . After completion study treatment , patient follow weekly 1 month , monthly 1 year , yearly 15 year .</detailed_description>
