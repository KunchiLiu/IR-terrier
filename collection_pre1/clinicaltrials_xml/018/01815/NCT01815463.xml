	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : The Adnab-9 antigen predictive biomarker individual risk develop colorectal neoplasia . Study aim evaluate potential Adnab-9 monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) marker cancer risk population increase risk colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . This marker would compare current emerge diagnostic method . 2,800 Veterans would recruit study . In phase 1 , candidate would define increased CRC risk short questionnaire . Stool sample would obtain semi-quantitative Adnab-9 antigen assay ( ELISA ) would determine . Patients differ high low estimation fecal Adnab-9 would undergo colonoscopy time sample effluent colonic mucosa would take , detailed lifestyle nutritional questionnaire would complete . The characteristic Adnab-9 fecal test diagnostic test would critically determine use outcome colonoscopic test result . The patient contact mail word mouth . Informed consent obtain sample obtain . The participant clinically define high-risk therefore screen colonoscopy would likely perform event . A number assay Adnab-9 feasible include slot-blot , Western blot , ELISA . Other stool study include conventional fecal occult blood test ( FOBT FIT ) perform tandem . The investigator therefore begin method collection obtain consent 2000 patient similar overall compliance rate FOBT screening procedure report previously approximately 50 % . Currently study longer enrol patient Detroit VA finalize data entry . Another 450 patient recruit Philadelphia VAMC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The primary objective test efficacy Adnab-9 stool test population high-risk colorectal neoplasia directly compare FOBT secondarily , identify source Adnab-9 antigen determine influence diet environment expression . The design prospective cross sectional ( Part 1 ) case-control longitudinal follow-up study ( Part 2 ) use brief questionnaire ass risk cancer total 2800 Part I patient enrol design achieve database high risk individual measure fecal Adnab-9 level clinically indicate colonoscopy perform . The patient submit 4 FOBT card routine manner mail , 3 use FOBT stool extract last card Adnab-9 ELISA report OD/5ug protein/well . 100 Part 2 enrollee select basis positive fecal Adnab-9 test candidate match like number patient negative stool result initial colonoscopy 5-year follow-up colonoscopy . Detailed Adnab-9 testing ( immunohistochemical Adnab-9 binding ; blood biomarker estimations Adnab-9 Western blot ) perform various bodily fluid perfect method test completion detail questionnaire check reproducibility interim lifestyle change participant .</detailed_description>
