	<brief_summary>Participants undergo radiation breast conserving surgery early breast cancer ( either Ductal Carcinoma In Situ ( DCIS ) , Early Stage Invasive breast cancer ) , increase risk develop skin reaction large breast size . After breast conserving surgery ( also know 'lumpectomy ' ) , woman either DCIS early stage invasive breast cancer receive radiation breast decrease risk cancer recurrence . Breast radiation usually do woman lie back ( `` supine '' ) . Some woman develop temporary breakdown skin ( moist desquamation ) . This skin reaction painful link long term side effect chronic pain decrease quality life . This study do woman large breast higher rate skin breakdown ( call 'moist desquamation ' ) breast pain shortly radiation therapy complete . It unclear skin reaction pain would improve alternate treatment position - namely lie belly ( `` prone '' ) radiation treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Prone Breast Radiation Therapy Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The risk moist desquamation large breast woman remain unacceptably high reaction tends severe produce significant permanent delay side effect . Evidence suggest use prone breast IMRT technique potential decrease risk moist desquamation large breast woman level see average/smaller breasted woman treat supine IMRT . As prone breast XRT currently offer 6 15 Ontario Cancer Centres poll purpose provide motivation study , multicentre RCT feasible confirm quantify improvement provide prone technique provide Level 1 evidence adopt world-wide .</detailed_description>
