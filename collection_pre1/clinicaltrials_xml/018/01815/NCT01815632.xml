	<brief_summary>Multiple sclerosis - MS - affect 1.3m people worldwide , cost European Union economy €9 billion/year , direct indirect consequence progressive disability . Despite usual relapsing-remitting presentation , 80 % patient develop progressive disability; 40 % require wheelchair within 10 year diagnosis . At present , treatment reverse , halt even slow progressive disability MS . The investigator recently complete one first feasibility/safety trial world reparative bone marrow cell therapy 6 patient longstanding MS ( www.nature.com/clpt/journal/v87/n6/full/clpt201044a.html ) . Safety confirm , intensive repeat test patient measure nerve conduction various pathway brain spinal cord show statistically significant improvement 12 month every patient . While highly preliminary involve small number patient , result least raise possibility significant ( though partial ) underlie repair effect within damage nervous system . The investigator believe urgently require test - accelerate benefit patient , begin improve therapeutic efficacy . The investigator therefore propose programme translational clinical stem cell research , aim ( 1 ) continue translation phase two control trial bone marrow cell patient longstanding MS; ( 2 ) explore parallel potential mechanism action , study bone marrow cell treat patient control subject , aim establish various relevant bone marrow subpopulation contribute efficacy , particular reparative mechanism ( ) important . The investigator hope study confirm therapeutic benefit approach , also provide basis improve magnitude impact novel excite treatment modality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Bone Marrow-derived Cellular Therapy Progressive Multiple Sclerosis ( ACTiMuS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective determine whether autologous bone marrow ( BM ) ( ie take patient rather BM donor ) cell therapy truly beneficial chronic multiple sclerosis - small , uncontrolled phase 1 trial suggest ( www.nature.com/clpt/journal/v87/n6/full/clpt201044a.html ) . The investigator also aim answer follow question : 1 . Do BM mesenchymal stem cell patient MS differ range extent reparative neuroprotective property control individual ? 2 . What reparative neuroprotective property BM stem cell subpopulation mesenchymal stem cell posse , differ MS patient control ? 3 . Can BM stem cell subpopulation isolate blood sample MS patient follow treatment , , , long ? Bone marrow contain stem cell capable replace cell blood . Recently , bone marrow find contain cell capable replace cell tissue organ blood . In addition , infusion bone marrow-derived cell show significant effect immune system promote survival central nervous system cell toxic condition . These property considerable interest work develop cell-based therapy neurodegenerative disease . The potential cell aid repair multiple sclerosis ( MS ) examine experimental model MS. Myelin substance insulates neuron within central nervous system attack MS. Infusion adult bone marrow cell vein aid myelin repair ( remyelination ) model MS . Recently , investigator perform small pilot study examine effect harvest bone marrow MS patient infuse back patient 's vein . This well tolerated significant adverse event encounter . Electrophysiological study appear show improvement , give small number participant phase 1 trial , definitive conclusion make regard . The current study seek address question whether genuine improvement neurophysiological test see MS patient progressive disease follow infusion bone marrow . A prospective , randomised , double-blind , placebo-controlled , step wedge design employ single centre ( Bristol , UK ) . Eighty patient progressive MS recruit ; 60 secondary progressive disease ( SPMS ) subset ( n=20 ) primary progressive disease ( PPMS ) . Participants randomise either early ( immediate ) late ( 1 year ) intravenous infusion autologous , unfractionated bone marrow . The placebo intervention infusion autologous blood . The primary outcome measure global evoke potential derive multimodal evoke potential . Secondary outcome measure include adverse event reporting , clinical ( EDSS MSFC ) self-assessment ( MSIS-29 ) rating scale , optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) well brain spine MRI . Participants follow year follow final intervention . Outcomes analyzed intention-to-treat basis .</detailed_description>
