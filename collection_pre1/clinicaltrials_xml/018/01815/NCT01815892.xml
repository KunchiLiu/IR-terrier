	<brief_title>The Use Furosemide Patients Dialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients often begin dialysis significant dose diuretic due retention sodium water predialysis phase chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . The quandary often face care team whether diuretic continued dialysis , particularly dialysis period time . For appropriate dialysis patient , daily dose furosemide , , minimize interdialytic weight gain , may result good blood pressure ( BP ) control may lower risk heart failure . Furthermore , may favourable impact cardiac remodel cardiac morbidity mortality . The diuretic may also increase excretion potassium , thereby reduce likelihood hyperkalemia . Patients significant renal sodium reabsorption would one would expect respond furosemide . Thus patient whose urine [ Na ] le 80 mM reabsorb significant amount filter Na ( glomerular filtrate [ Na ] would 130 140mM ) thus might expect respond furosemide . ( This premise assumption urine [ Na ] vary much day chronic dialysis recipient , establish course study . ) The patient Dry Weight optimize prior entry study accord usual care : involve integrate BP data , central venous pressure assess internal jugular vein , patient symptom ( eg , dyspnea interdialytic interval , prolong lightheadedness/presyncope/fatigue dialysis ) .. Patients dialysis take furosemide ask stop furosemide 2 week , dry weight maintain ultrafiltration dialysis alone . After 2 week , establish whether diurnal variation urine [ Na ] collect urine separate container , appropriately label date time , 24 hr period end pre dialysis long interdialytic interval . These collection also determine whether diurnal variation [ Na ] , individual urine [ Na ] , well indicate 24 hour urine volume Na excretion furosemide . All urine sample assay concentration Na , K , creatinine , well volume . Thereafter , patient give furosemide 120 mgm every morning 2 week collect urine void voiding ( labeling time void ) separate container 24 hr period end pre dialysis long interdialytic interval 2 week . These collection answer whether diurnal variation [ Na ] furosemide , well determine 24 hour urine volume Na excretion furosemide . The result determine whether patient take furosemide indeed benefit ( Na , K H2O excretion ) help one predict whether patient take furosemide , might indeed benefit take . At conclusion 2-week period furosemide therapy , patient 's primary nephrologist determine need continue agent decision make continue furosemide , dose would discretion nephrologist . The primary outcome increase urine volume 24 hour sodium excretion response furosemide therapy</detailed_description>
