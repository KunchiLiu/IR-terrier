	<brief_title>Evaluation 18F-DCFBC PSMA-based PET Imaging Detection Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study evaluate radiolabeled urea-based small molecule inhibitor prostate-specific membrane antigen ( PSMA ) , [ 18F ] DCFBC ( DCFBC ) PET image detection metastatic prostate cancer . PSMA well characterize histological marker prostate cancer tumor aggressiveness metastatic potential . The investigator propose assess ability DCFBC PET detect metastatic prostate cancer visual qualitative quantitative SUV analysis . Correlation make site suspect metastatic disease detect standard conventional imaging modality ( CIM ) prostate cancer include IV contrast CT chest/abdomen/pelvis whole body bone scintigraphy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histological confirmation prostate cancer 2 . Radiologic evidence new progressive metastatic disease demonstrate anatomical imaging ( CT , MRI , ultrasound ) , bone scintigraphy , [ 18F ] Sodium Fluoride PET , and/or [ 18F ] FDG PET 3 . Rising PSA two observation take least 1 week apart 4 . Adequate peripheral venous access available central venous catheter access radiopharmaceutical administration 5 . Patient remain androgen deprivation therapy regimen prior documentation progressive metastatic disease 6 . Patient start new therapy prostate cancer prior study radiopharmaceutical image 7 . Patient judge Investigator initiative mean compliant protocol within geographical proximity make require study visit 8 . Patients legal representative must ability read , understand provide write informed consent initiation study relate procedure 1 . Patient treat investigational drug , investigational biologic , investigational therapeutic device within 14 day prior study radiotracer administration 2 . Prior radiation therapy , chemotherapy , androgendeprivation therapy within 2 week prior study radiotracer administration ( Washout one halflife drug 2 week , whichever long ) 3 . Initiation new therapy progressive metastatic disease since radiographic documentation progression . 4 . Serum creatinine &gt; 3 time upper limit normal 5 . Total bilirubin &gt; 3 time upper limit normal 6 . Liver Transaminases &gt; 5times upper limit normal 7 . Unable lie flat tolerate PET/CT 8 . Prior history malignancy within last 2 year , skin basal cell cutaneous superficial squamous cell carcinoma metastasize superficial bladder cancer .</criteria>
