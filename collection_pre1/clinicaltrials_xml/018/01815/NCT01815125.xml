	<brief_summary>Background : Most patient suffer mild Traumatic Brain Injury ( mTBI ) present persistent symptom one week post injury . A systematic review show paucity study short term outcome follow mTBI . Among potential treatment mTBI , ondansetron show promise result base clinical experience single retrospective study . Objectives : The primary objective pilot study determine feasibility randomize control trial evaluate effect ondansetron decrease post concussion symptom one week follow mTBI child . More specifically , pilot study evaluate proportion participant complete assessment one week follow intervention . Method : This randomize , double blind , control trial performed among child age 8 17 year old sustain mTBI previous 24 hour . Participants visit emergency department randomize receive one dose either ondansetron placebo . The primary outcome interest define increase pre-concussion baseline least 3 symptom Post Concussion Symptom Inventory ( PCSI ) one week follow trauma . Secondary outcome include time full recovery , mean PCSI score , outcomes one month follow head trauma . The primary analysis compare proportion participant persistence symptom one week group . The full study sample size calculate 90 % power detect decrease proportion persistence symptoms 50 % 30 % alpha value 0.05 . Approximately 126 patient therefore recruit arm . The investigator plan recruit 30 participant ( 10 % final population ) pilot study . Expected result : This pilot study confirm feasibility randomize control trial show 90 % recruited participant provide data primary outcome one week follow intervention . On long term , investigator expect ondansetron decrease proportion patient sustain persistent symptom concussion 50 % low 30 % .</brief_summary>
