	<brief_summary>This clinical trial examine role genetic polymorphism effect clopidogrel ( without aspirin ) platelet response person high-risk myocardial infarction stroke due family history early-onset coronary artery disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacogenomics Antiplatelet Response - I</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main goal study explore impact PEAR1 genetic variant ( rs12041331 ) responsiveness clopidogrel . The investigator assess role genetic variant determine response single dual anti-platelet therapy . Apparently healthy subject ( N= 2108 ) high-risk family ( ) identify proband early-onset CAD ( b ) genotyped Illumina 1 million platform , imputation 2.5 million single nucleotide polymorphism . The investigator plan characterize variance platelet aggregation multiple agonist ( ADP , collagen , arachidonic acid ) 1-week therapy clopidogrel high-risk subset GeneSTAR subject ( N=100 ) . The investigator plan determine extent variant identify PEAR1 gene modify platelet responsiveness inhibition clopidogrel high-risk subset . In addition , investigator aim determine extent variant recently discover gene , , combination PEAR1 , modify platelet responsiveness clopidogrel alone aspirin high-risk subset . Lastly , investigator also want determine change platelet mRNA produce aspirin alone aspirin clopidogrel .</detailed_description>
