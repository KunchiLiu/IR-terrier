	<brief_summary>Necrotizing pancreatitis severe form inflammation pancreas subsequent destruction pancreas ( necrosis ) . Often , condition manifest patient overwhelm systemic inflammatory response multisystem organ failure . Many time pancreas become superinfected bacteria organisms result process . Clinicians may decide sample fluid pancreas pancreatic tissue determine presence infection . This do surgery concurrent debridement drainage pancreas radiologist use ultrasound CT guide method sample pancreatic fluid . These sample send culture microbiology laboratory . Culture result often reveal 1-2 type infect bacteria originate gastrointestinal tract . The investigator hypothesize actuality , many different kind bacteria may infect pancreas . This project use molecular DNA technique help identify bacteria present pancreas patient severe necrotizing pancreatitis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In study , patient severe necrotizing pancreatitis follow prospectively throughout hospital course ( anticipated duration hospitalization range 4-8 week ) . If patient suspect infection pancreatic necrosis , consent enrollment . Patients determine attend physician require either operative intervention radiologic guide drainage pancreatic necrosis infect peripancreatic fluid . At time drainage procedure intervention , one sample peripancreatic fluid send hospital 's microbiology department standard gram stain bacterial culture identification second sample frozen bacterial DNA analysis . Patients follow duration hospitalization hospital outcome , mortality final microbiology culture result . Samples process six month one year follow sample collection bacterial DNA deep sequence analysis compare bacteria identify use standard culture technique .</detailed_description>
