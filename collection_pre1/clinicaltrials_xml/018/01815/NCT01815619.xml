	<brief_summary>This study test two different method process biopsy specimen take bile duct . Patient ; ask participate int study growth ( mass ) bile duct need biopsy diagnosis make . Standard care include perform 5-7 biopsy bile duct send tissue lab test make diagnosis . Using method investigator establish diagnosis 50 % time . The investigator believe pathologist available endoscopy suite procedure , investigator improve test result . The purpose study compare two method process biopsy obtain bile duct .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison On-Site Verus Off-Site Evaluation Cholangioscopy-Guided Biopsies Bile Duct</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The diagnostic accuracy rate cholangioscopy-guided biopsy 50 % . This translate need perform repeat procedure establish diagnosis therefore delay patient treatment . The biopsy specimen obtain cholangioscopy usually process offsite pathology lab . We believe pathologist assess tissue sample procedure ( onsite ) provide feedback , diagnostic accuracy rate improve . This translate good ( faster ) diagnosis early treatment . Therefore , compare onsite versus offsite evaluation bile duct biopsy specimens determine method yield good diagnosis .</detailed_description>
