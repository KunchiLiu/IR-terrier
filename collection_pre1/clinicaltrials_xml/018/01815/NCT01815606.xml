	<brief_summary>This study test two different needle perform biopsy pancreas endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) procedure . Patients ask participate study growth pancreas measure great 35mm need biopsy diagnosis make . The biopsy perform use either 19 25-Gauge needle . The purpose study compare two needle well perform biopsy pancreas mass great 35mm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Comparing 19 25G Needles Fine Needle Aspiration ( FNA ) Solid Pancreatic Mass Lesions Greater Than 35mm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Endoscopic Ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration ( EUS-FNA ) perform use 25 , 22 19 gauge ( G ) needle . Randomized trial show three needle safe perform equally well . However , retrospective study , diagnostic sensitivity EUS-FNA pancreatic mass measure 35mm less compare small size mass . This large size tumor necrosis difficult identify cancer cell make diagnosis . Therefore , biopsy must perform large size tumor establish diagnosis . In previous study show large 19G needle procure large good quality tissue . Therefore , hypothesis , large 19G needle use FNA tumor 35mm , diagnosis achieve few pass .</detailed_description>
