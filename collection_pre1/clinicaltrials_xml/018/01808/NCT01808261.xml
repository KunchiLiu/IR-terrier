	<brief_title>Proof Concept ( POC ) Patients With Ischaemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myelin-associated glycoprotein ( MAG ) one key proteins know inhibit neuronal regeneration release oligodendrocyte condition neuronal injury , stroke . GSK249320 humanise monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) bind high specificity MAG antagonise neutralise MAG-mediated inhibition show improve functional recovery stroke pre-clinical model , possibly promote neuroregeneration plasticity . The present study ( MAG104615 ) design establish Proof Concept ( PoC ) GSK249320 ischemic stroke patient . MAG104615 placebo-controlled , double-blind , multicenter , randomize , repeat dose , Bayesian design study . PoC achieve demonstrate clinically meaningful improvement low limb motor recovery , specifically evaluate change gait velocity baseline Day 90/Month 3 . Subjects also follow Day 180/Month 6 evaluate long term motor recovery safety . Additional secondary efficacy measure motor recovery evaluate demonstrate characterize extent duration overall motor recovery treatment GSK249320 . Changes disability neurological impairment characterize treatment GSK249320 explore relate motor recovery . This PoC study also characterize safety , PK , immunogenicity GSK249320 explore pharmacodynamic ( PD ) marker , explore use actigraphy measure motor recovery . Subjects stratify gait velocity baseline randomization ( 1:1 allocation ) one two treatment group : 15mg/kg GSK249320 , placebo . Each subject receive 2 repeat IV dose GSK249320 placebo .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Have confirm diagnosis stroke accord World Health Organization definition , ' rapid onset event vascular origin reflect focal disturbance cerebral function , exclude isolated impairment high function , persist long 24 hour [ World Health Organization , 1989 ] . Stroke onset must within last 2472 hour first infusion Investigational Product . Time stroke onset defined time patient/relative first aware stroke deficit . For patient awake deficit , find unconscious , time onset define time last known symptom free . Have stroke radiologically confirm ischemic supratentorial . The diameter ischemic lesion &gt; 15mm single direction volume &gt; 4cc . See Study Procedures Manual ( SPM ) guidance calculate lesion size . Have total NIHSS score 321 . Have low limb deficit incident stroke define score 14 NIHSS Motor Leg question ( question # 6 ) . Aged 1890 , inclusive . Expectation subject receive standard physical , occupational speech rehabilitation therapy indicate post stroke deficit . Male subject female subject nonchildbearing childbearing potential allow participate study . See Section 11 , Appendix 1 definition . Females childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test prior enrollment must agree use one contraceptive method specify Section 11 , Appendix 1 . Ability walk &gt; 0.8m/s measure Gait Velocity assessment . History previous symptomatic stroke within 3 month prior study entry . Presence significant disability prior current stroke . Significant disability define prestroke Rankin score &gt; 2 . Subjects alert unresponsive define score 2 3 NIHSS Level Consciousness question ( Question 1a ) . Presence significant aphasia likely confound interfere completion study assessment . Presence significant preexist gait deficit prior study entry likely confound clinical evaluation Presence preexist neurologic psychiatric disease active adequately control interfered major activity daily live immediately prior current stroke likely interfere study participation/visits confound clinical evaluation . The subject pose significant suicide risk , opinion investigator . Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( except Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) , know history hepatitis B hepatitis C infection . A positive hepatitis B hepatitis C result GSK labs draw baseline/Study Day 1 exclude subject continue study unless associate clinical signs/symptoms liver disease ; however , subject treat clinically indicate GSK Medical Monitor contact discussion . Presence either central peripheral demyelinating disease , multiple sclerosis IgM monoclonal gammopathy unknown significance ( MGUS ) . Expected death due incident stroke , evidence chronic comorbid condition unstable acute systemic illness , opinion investigator , could shorten subject 's survival would limit his/her ability complete study . Presence follow ECG value baseline ECG : QTc &gt; 500 msec ( use either Bazett 's formula ( QTcB ) Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) ) ; uncorrected QT &gt; 600msec ( machine manual overread ) . If ECG indicate prolonged QTc interval value outside limit , two ECGs perform sit average QTc value triplicate ECGs calculate . If average value exceed state limit , subject eligible . Participation investigational rehabilitation paradigm target stroke recovery duration study . Have contraindication MRI per local hospital practice/guidelines . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Prior treatment GSK249320 . History sensitivity Investigational Product excipients ( acetate buffer , polysorbate 80 sodium chloride ) , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate subject 's participation . Pregnant female determine positive urine hCG test prior enrollment . Lactating female . Subjects consider unwilling unable comply procedure study ï»¿visit schedule outline protocol .</criteria>
