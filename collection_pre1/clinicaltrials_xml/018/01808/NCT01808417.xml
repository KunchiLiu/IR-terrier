	<brief_summary>This research study Phase I clinical trial . Phase I clinical trial test feasibility safety investigational technique drug . This study try define appropriate dose investigational drug indocyanine green ( ICG ) combination near infrared ( NIR ) image use study . `` Investigational '' mean drug , ICG , approve FDA image us , lymphatic mapping use NIR light . Its use follow lymphatic pathway tumor human body still study research doctor try find . It also mean FDA approve ICG map type cancer . ICG dye approve test liver function measure blood flow heart . This drug use study map lymphatic pathway lung cancer breast cancer information research study suggest dye may help identify lymph node associate esophageal tumor research study . ICG detect within body use special near-infrared light camera . In research study , investigator look easily ICG get first lymph node ( call sentinel lymph node SLN ) associate esophageal tumor whether investigator see path ICG respective SLN use near infrared camera .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If willing participate study ask undergo review medical history confirm eligible . If review show eligible begin study treatment . If meet eligibility criterion , able participate research study . Your primary surgeon coordinate date time surgery , hospital confirm schedule . At time surgery , dose ICG mixed normal saline , solution salt water , administer four small injection immediately around tumor . You receive approximately half teaspoon normal saline/ICG solution . You general anesthesia . Pictures ICG solution take NIR camera progression dye , make way along lymphatic channel location tumor SLN , monitor . After five fifteen minute , surgeon continue procedure , remove lymph node accord standard care . The surgeon discus ahead time . As lymph node remove , take picture see ICG dye enter colored node . Following removal lymph node , surgeon complete operation continue monitor 30 minute rare possible side effect ( allergic reaction ) ICG . You remove study . With exception administration ICG photography NIR camera , change standard care . Following surgery , collect final pathology result procedure . Because look determine feasibility technique use NIR imaging , wish follow period time follow procedure . If experience rare possible side effect ICG , normal saline , NIR light , continue monitor condition resolve .</detailed_description>
