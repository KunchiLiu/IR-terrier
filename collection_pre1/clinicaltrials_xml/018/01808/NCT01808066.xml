The investigator 's goal measure actual attention rate times student , subjective observation player ' engagement device , motivation play game , interest initially time , perceive effect game attention . This type study commonly know 'play-testing ' software product target audience ; process refine `` design-based research '' academia ( Laurel , 2003 ) use assess quality digital design learn ( Barab &amp; Squire , 2004 ) use data improve . This study qualitative counter-balance quantitative work do separately University Minnesota ( Under Dr. Srivastava ) , use clinical computer base diagnostics data mining respectively product . Digital tool facilitate traditional '21st century skill ' via new information communication technology knowledge work , think , learning , lead digital lifestyle ( p. 23 ) ( Trilling &amp; Fadel , 2009 ) . Further grow evidence skill , along traditional literacy learn use digital application ( Gee , 2007 ; Squire &amp; Barab , 2004 ; Steinkuehler &amp; Duncan , 2008 ) . Early evidence digital tool 'amplify ' learning activity show potential digital technology beneficial even 'played ' use 'in wild ' ( Squire &amp; Dikkers , 2012 ) . This study seek explore learning attribute digitally mediate learning experience design particular learning goal . Additionally , current diagnostic aid , use treat attention capacity Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder ( ADHD ) Autism , currently expensive , time intensive , provide little information accessory movement response stimulus . One ten child , age 5 17 , diagnose ADHD ; number kid autism increase 78 % last ten year http : //www.cnn.com/2012/03/29/ health/autism/index.html ) . This study seek assess accessibility usability software seek help shape attention strategy play 'fun ' learn ADHD Autistic child struggle attention . If effective could valuable affordable option educational institution serve learner .
