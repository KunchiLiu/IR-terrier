	<brief_summary>This open label , single-arm , non-controlled , multicentre study determine effect ambrisentan exercise capacity ( 6MWT ) Chinese subject PAH . The study consist screen period 4 week , 12-week primary evaluation period ( PEP ) 12-week dose-adjustment period ( DAP ) . Ambrisentan 5 mg administer eligible subject 12 week ( PEP ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Ambrisentan Chinese Patients With Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension ( PAH )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) consist group progressive incurable disease pulmonary vasculature . These characterise profound vasoconstriction abnormal proliferation smooth muscle cell wall pulmonary artery , lead progressive increase pulmonary vascular resistance ( PVR ) sustain elevation pulmonary artery pressure ( PAP ) . A variety drug class use treat PAH single compound yet show effective treating patient disease . Three widely use treatment option calcium channel blocker ( CCBs ) , diuretics anticoagulant vary responses.There lack clinical data ambrisentan among Chinese population , Ambrisentan conditionally approve treatment PAH China.A clinical trial minimum 100 patient ambrisentan arm request SFDA.Several PAH medication approve China , placebo-controlled study ethically appropriate active control non-inferiority design unfeasible due sample size requirement inconsistency indication .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Signed write informed consent prior begin studyrelated procedure . Subject must 1875 year age , inclusive , Screening Visit . Subjects must weight ≥40 kg Screening Visit . Subjects must symptomatic severe PAH ( WHO functional class II III ) categorise class 1 PAH ( define Updated Clinical Classification Pulmonary Hypertension 2009 ) , due iPAH , congenital heart diseasecongenital heart defect repair great 1 year prior screening ( i.e. , atrial septal defect , ventricular septal defect patent ductus arteriosus ) CTDrelated PAH ( e.g. , limited scleroderma , diffuse scleroderma , mixed CTD , systemic lupus erythematosus overlap syndrome ) . NOTE : subject portopulmonary hypertension pulmonary venoocclusive disease NOT eligible study . Subjects must right heart catheterisation within 6 month prior screen meet follow haemodynamic criterion : 1 . Mean PAP ≥ 25 mmHg . 2 . A PVR ≥ 240 dyn/sec/cm5 . 3 . A PCWP leave ventricular ( LV ) enddiastolic pressure ≤ 15 mmHg . Subjects must able walk distance least 150 450 m. In addition , screen baseline 6MWT test value must vary great 10 % ( calculate use ( baseline screening ) /screening result 0.1 0.1 ) . Subjects must meet following pulmonary function criterion . The test complete 24 week prior Screening Visit , perform within previous 24 week , test must complete Day 0 : 1 . Total lung capacity ( TLC ) ≥ 60 % predict normal . 2 . Forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) ≥ 55 % predict normal . Subjects receive CCBs must stable therapy ( i.e. , dose level need change maintain disease control ) least 1 month prior Screening Visit . Subjects receive 3hydroxy3methylglutarylcoenzyme A ( HMGCoA ) reductase inhibitor ( i.e. , statin ) must stable therapy ( i.e. , dose level need change maintain disease control ) least 12 week prior Screening Visit . Female subject childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test Screening Visit Day 0 . Female subject childbearing potential sexually active must agree use two reliable method contraception ( describe Appendix 3 ) Screening Visit study completion least 30 day follow last dose IP . Subjects Copper T 380A intrauterine device ( IUD ) LNg 20 IUD insert require use additional method contraception . Subject must agree participate clinical study involve another IP device throughout study . The subject receive PAH therapy ( PDE5 inhibitor , ERA , chronic prostanoid* ) within 4 week prior Screening Visit . *Prostanoid use class chronic treatment continue 7 day . The subject receive intravenous inotropes ( e.g. , dopamine , dobutamine ) within 2 week prior Screening Visit . The subject previously discontinue ERA treatment ( e.g. , bosentan ) due safety tolerance issue associate liver function abnormality . The subject serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) value &gt; 2 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Screening Visit . The subject serum bilirubin value &gt; 1.5 x ULN Screening Visit . The subject severe hepatic impairment ( ChildPugh class C without cirrhosis ) Screening Visit .

The subject laboratory result , physical examination finding , medical history incident finding , contraindication treatment ERA . Contraindications treatment include , limited , evidence elevate liver function test previously experience event would define serious AE ( SAE ) clinical trial ( see Section 6.3.3.2 ) , attribute treatment ERA .
