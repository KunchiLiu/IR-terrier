	<brief_summary>The usual intervention control pain outpatient endometrial ablation use local anaesthesia ( LA ) injection neck womb ( cervix ) . However , alone may sufficient control pain completely . Therefore , want find whether injection LA give deep muscle womb ( myometrium ) , addition cervix , good effect control pain procedure . All woman attend gynaecology outpatient clinic , consent outpatient hysteroscopic procedure , invite take part study . The study carry outpatient hysteroscopy clinic Birmingham Women 's Hospital . As part standard pain control method outpatient endometrial ablation , woman receive injection LA cervix uterus 'freeze ' . During hysteroscopy randomly select treatment group receive injection deep muscle contain normal saline ( control group ) whereas experiment group receive fast / long act local anaesthesia ( cornual block ) . Women ask rate degree pain place mark ungraduated 10 cm horizontal line . These scale give procedure , LA injection , immediately , one hour time discharge hospital . The result help future patient undergo similar procedure much good pain relief allow many procedure without side effect general anaesthetic risk . In addition le pain , may reduce number painkiller need well stay hospital . In future may also allow great variety procedure do outpatient setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Role Intrauterine Cornual Block Combination With Direct Cervical Block Outpatient Endometrial Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Outpatient local anaesthesic ( LA ) hysteroscopic intrauterine therapeutic intervention endometrial ablation gain wide acceptance last decade . However , pain experienced procedure disincentive common reason use escalating level analgesia post procedure , result prolongation hospital stay recovery . Various method LA study include intrauterine topical lignocaine cervical block use topical lignocaine , paracervical block intracervical block . However , single site block individually may sufficient control pain completely due inability one site block affect sensitivity whole uterus , uterine fundus effectively still unanaesthetised . This may due uterus receive complex innervation different nerve route uterovaginal plexus , Frankenhauser nerve plexus , parasympathetic ganglion thoracic nerve . Therefore , seem logical use direct cervical block block sensation uterovaginal plexus use additional deep myometrial block adjacent cornu directly block thoracic nerve supply . To date , one small observational study look effect combine block relieve pain outpatient hysteroscopic procedure . Therefore , propose undertake double blind randomise control trial address question compare effectiveness standard direct cervical block intrauterine cornual block ( ICOB ) versus direct cervical block normal saline intrauterine cornual injection ( control ) .</detailed_description>
