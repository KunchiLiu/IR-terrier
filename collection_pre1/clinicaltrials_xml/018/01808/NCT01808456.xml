	<brief_summary>Influenza infection recipient solid organ transplant recipient maintenance immunosuppressant therapy associate increased morbidity mortality . Although influenza vaccination recommend high-risk patient , safety immunogenicity commercially available different strength influenza vaccine establish . The primary study objective determine safety immunogenicity Fluzone Fluzone High-Dose , secondary objective determine tolerability efficacy two different strength trivalent influenza vaccine ( TIV , flu vaccine ) . Both vaccine commercially available use general population . Fluzone approve use 6 month age old , Fluzone High-Dose approve use 65 year age old . This exploratory , open-label , parallel group , observer blind , prospective study . All recipient kidney , lung , heart transplant attend post-transplant follow-up , least 30-days transplantation Inova Fairfax Hospital Transplant Center eligible enrollment . Enrolled patient follow three month ( total 4 visit ) follow enrollment randomization : day 0 ( enrollment ) follow-up visit week 1 , 4 , 8 , 12 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A potential strategy enhance immune response influenza vaccine patient population could use different strength TIV . One pathways improve immunogenicity inactivate vaccine increase dose influenza antigen contain vaccine . Studies demonstrate increase dose influenza virus hemagglutinin commonly encounter viral strain beyond conventional dose 15 microgram strain associate dose-dependent increase serum antibody titer . Influenza TIV commercially available two different strength , Fluzone well Fluzone High-Dose , valuable variable immunogenic potency different strength . Fluzone approve use person 6 month age old . High-dose Fluzone approve use person 65 year age old . The purpose exploratory study ass safety , tolerability , immunogenicity two commercially available different strength TIV solid organ transplant recipient ( kidney , heart lung ) period 30 day transplant procedure . We evaluate safety , tolerability ( reactogenicity ) immunogenicity two different strength commercially available TIV single center , cluster randomization , investigator blind , study enrol patient post-transplant clinic Inova Fairfax Hospital : August 1 , 2013 - March 31 , 2014 ; August 1 , 2014 March 31 , 2015 . Study protocol remain active till December 31 , 2016 . All bio-specimens store till December 31 , 2016 .</detailed_description>
