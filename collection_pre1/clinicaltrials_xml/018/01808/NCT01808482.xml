	<brief_summary>This 3-part study Parts A , B ( single-blind - investigator subject blind ) enrol healthy volunteer Part C ( open-label ) enrol RRMS patient . Parts A ( single ascend dose ) B ( repeat ascend dose ) ass safety , tolerability , PK PD GSK2618960 . Part C ( repeat dos ) ass safety , tolerability , PK , PD , immunogenicity , paraclinical ( magnetic resonance image [ MRI ] lesion count ) disease activity marker Th1 Th17 mechanism . Part A : Each 24 healthy volunteer ( divide 5 group ) , take part 2 plan 8 dosing session ( A-active , P-placebo ) . Subjects group Part A randomize 2:1:1 ratio one follow sequence : AA , AP PA dose session receive study treatment 3:1 ratio active : placebo respectively . Part B : Dosing level regimen dependent upon safety tolerability PK/receptor occupancy ( RO ) data Part A . In Cohort 1 , 12 subject randomize 3:1 ratio A P. Each subject receive study treatment repeat dos . If duration full RO high dose Part A less 4 week , second cohort 12 subject Part B may recruit , base Dose Escalation Committee ( DEC ) decision Part C : The 20 RRMS patient assign active treatment 2 4 repeated dos . Safety/tolerability PK data monitoring decision proceed next dose level GSK2618960 , decision proceed Part B Part C study make dose escalation committee .</brief_summary>

Subjects history current vaccination status influenza consent receive influenza vaccine screen study dose predict result &gt; 75 % RO Flu season ( October April ) . Male subject female partner childbearing potential must agree use one contraception method . This criterion must follow time first dose study . MS Patients Suitable determine Principal Investigator , base his/her overall evaluation . Must confirm diagnosis RRMS accord 2010 revision McDonald Criteria.. Must history least two clinical episode demyelination . Have demonstrate clinical paraclinical activity 12 month prior screen ( may occur whilst diseasemodifying therapy ) either : One document relapse , OR one document Gd enhance lesion brain spinal cord , Expanded Disability Status Scale ( EDSS ) score &lt; =0 screening . Male female 18 55 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . A female subject eligible participate follow : Nonchildbearing potential , females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one contraception method woman childbearing potential use one contraception method . Male subject must agree use one contraception method . Subjects history current vaccination status tetanus , diphtheria , pertussis , measles , mumps rubella ( consent vaccination screen ) . Subjects expect study participation Flu season ( October April ) , history current vaccination status influenza consent receive influenza vaccine screening . Body weight &gt; =50 kg . On ECG , QTcF interval &lt; 450 msec ; QTcF &lt; 480 msec subject bundle branch block . Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form , authorisation release use protect health information ( PHI ) . Healthy Volunteers A positive prestudy Hepatitis B surface antigen positive Hepatitis C antibody result within 3 month screen . A positive test HIV antibody . Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen . History smoke within 6 month screen . History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study define : An average weekly intake &gt; 21 unit male . One unit equivalent 8 g alcohol : halfpint ( ~240 milliliter [ mL ] ) beer , 1 glass ( 125 mL ) wine 1 ( 25 mL ) measure spirit . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) .
