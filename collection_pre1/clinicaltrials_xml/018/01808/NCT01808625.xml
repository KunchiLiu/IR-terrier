	<brief_summary>Radiotherapy mainstay treatment brain malignancy associate significant neurotoxicity . Due continuous increase patient 's survival , long term risk radiation-induced brain inflammation necrosis induce secondary cognitive impairment increase concern . Currently effective treatment prevent long term radiation-induced brain damage . Hyperbaric oxygen therapy ( HBOT ) administration high oxygen concentration within pressurized chamber increase cellular/mitochondrial delivery oxygen . Oxygen stimulation HBOT become definitive therapy radiation-induced damage soft tissue bone due ability stimulate healing process supply energy/oxygen need down-regulating gene involve inflammation . Oxygen stimulation HBOT currently indicate patient overt radiation-induced neurotoxicity proven reduce development radiation damage stimulate `` idle '' neuron return function . Since HBOT consider safe , hypothesize application follow radiation , manifestation neurological side effect , may help avert development early/delayed onset radiation-induced neurotoxicity . In proposed study , first time , HBOT apply early radiation prevent expect decrease patient neurocognitive function ( NCF ) improve quality life ( QOL ) . The study design provide statistically significant assessment , prospective randomize clinical trial , effect oxygen stimulation apply soon brain radiotherapy , patient primary secondary brain tumor , patient QOL NCF . In addition , advance image methodology apply study feasibility quantify oxygen stimulation effect tumor surround brain tissue .</brief_summary>
