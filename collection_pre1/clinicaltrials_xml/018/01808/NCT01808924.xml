	<brief_summary>The overall objective project thoroughly investigate effect diet-induced weight loss absence combination exercise skeletal muscle IR , energy metabolism function . These study significantly improve understand fundamental biochemical molecular factor link intervention-induced change mitochondrion , oxidative stress , lipotoxicity , IR , loss muscle function age human .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Muscle Insulin Resistance In Aging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aging associate alteration skeletal muscle energy metabolism , insulin resistance high prevalence type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . Aging also associate progressive loss muscle mass increase adiposity , know sarcopenic obesity , lead mobility limitation disability . However , cause insulin resistance sarcopenia human know . This project provide novel information regard potential factor underlie metabolic dysfunction sarcopenia age muscle - namely , mitochondrion accumulation intramyocellular lipid . Within conceptual framework help elucidate biological underpinnings two significant health problem related age . In addition , provide intervention-based evidence well understand complex age-related disorder whether mitochondrion intramyocellular lipid modifiable target improve prevention treatment strategy metabolic muscle dysfunction . Therefore , overall objective employ highly innovative method muscle biopsy specimens order determine functional clinically relevant consequence intervention well alteration several novel biochemical molecular factor potentially underlie intervention effect human skeletal muscle . Our primary approach address aim propose study conduct 6-month randomized control trial obese ( BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 ) sedentary old men woman 65-80 year age . 1 . Control ( health education ) group ( CON ) : Subjects receive specific exercise dietary education prescription , ask participate biweekly health education session . 2 . Diet-induced weight loss ( DIWL ) : The goal achieve goal 10 % weight loss . 3 . Weight Loss + Exercise ( WLEX ) : This group receive exactly dietary intervention respective DIWL group . In addition , subject complete progressive , moderate intensity supervise This single-site randomized control trial . The analysis aim involve multiple step draw statistical method range simple descriptive statistic model repeated measure outcome data account potential missing observation . The major outcome study , muscle biopsy parameter , insulin sensitivity , muscle mass , strength , power quality , measure entry study end study .</detailed_description>
