	<brief_summary>The purpose project see heritable alteration function , biology vascular repair capacity vascular cell make major contribution burden coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , fibromuscular dysplasia ( FMD ) , vascular disease . In detail , FMD nonatherosclerotic vascular disease primarily affect woman age 20 60 . It commonly affect renal carotid artery may involve almost every artery body . At cellular level , FMD characterize increase fibroblast proliferation collagen deposition . This study aim define cellular problem directly study fibroblast cell FMD patient healthy control subject . Similarly , CAD among lead cause death worldwide . However , large part risk CAD unexplained . It think major undefined risk factor may gene ( genomic ) variation cause change vascular cell function . Here , study important vascular cell type patient severe early onset CAD attempt define problem . Therefore , summary , study look define various cellular-level problem occur patient CAD FMD . These data link DNA-level analysis ultimately attempt define cause condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose project see heritable alteration function , biology vascular repair capacity vascular cell make major contribution burden coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , fibromuscular dysplasia ( FMD ) , vascular disease . Patients refer study physician he/she feel patient qualifies entry study base upon Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria expect physician suitable candidate . This include : 1 ) patient FMD non-affected control subject , 2 ) patient early onset CAD absence significant CAD risk factor , match healthy control ≥2 cardiovascular risk factor CAD ( angiographically 'normal ' coronary artery ) . Also , extension study , patient rare , undiagnosed unusual form CAD ( e.g . unexplained dissection , fulminant calcification , aneurysms etc . ) appropriate control , recruit , particularly strong family pedigree . This study include collection whole blood subsequent DNA isolation sequencing , plasma sample , skin biopsy . Blood handle standard fashion obtain DNA leukocytes plasma . These store pending later batch analysis . Once skin biopsy tissue collect , tissue send lab processing . The initial step derive fibroblast skin biopsy . In brief , biopsy wash , cut small fragment distributed culture dish growth medium incubate 37°C . Over next 4 - 6 week , fibroblast progressively grow collect . We may induce fibroblast undergo change become stem cell ( call `` induced pluripotent stem cell '' iPSCs ) . Once make iPSCs , make endothelial cell ( iPSC-ECs ) , fact , many cell type . The cell frozen analysis , experiment do future . All derived cell ( fibroblast , iPSCs iPSC-ECs ) generate protocol keep indefinitely , may use future study cause aspect FMD CAD . This study concern clinical event patient enrollment . Only clinical event occur prior enrollment ( e.g . prior myocardial infarction , stroke , dissection ) record . Once obtained cell , detail cellular molecular analysis perform study particular cellular defect associate differ condition . This data combine DNA- plasma-derived data attempt define underlie basis disorder . As treatment , alternative treatment option apply . The subject decide participate trial . No benefit promise subject study . The information gain may benefit others condition .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Clinical diagnosis FMD base current guideline criterion relevant imaging result . For ETCAD ( early onset CAD ) = patient &lt; 50 year age males &lt; 55 female &gt; 60 % stenosis ≥2 coronary artery branch , SYNTAX score ≥12 ( significant CAD ) , absence acquire CAD risk factor . Patients &gt; 60 % stenosis ≥2 coronary artery branch , SYNTAX score ≥12 , also eligible ETCAD group follow : ) &lt; 40 year age males &lt; 45 female presence one acquire risk factor ; b ) &lt; 35 year age males female two acquire risk factor . Patients already undergone revascularization eligible criterion fulfil aggregate SYNTAX score ≥12 would reach treated lesion , disease ≥2 coronary artery branch , accord criterion ( 1 ) ( 2 ) . For Healthy Controls = age match patient undergone angiography CAD ( 'normal coronary artery ' ; SYNTAX score = 0 ) ≥2 acquire CAD risk factor . Control subject FMD study unaffected family member , unrelated person match age gender . For subject , inclusion criterion : . Age &gt; 18 year ; b. Fluency English Spanish ( Spanish consent form provide ) ; c. Freely willing participate sign informed consent . Acquired Risk Factors define : ( 1 ) Diabetes &gt; 2 year HBA1C &gt; 10.0 % ; ( 2 ) Smoker &gt; 5 packyears entire lifetime ; ( 3 ) Obesity ( BMI &gt; 30kg/m2 ) ; ( 4 ) Dyslipidemia , define use lipid lower therapy , physician diagnosis dyslipidemia , serum total cholesterol &gt; 240 mg/dL lowdensity lipoproteincholesterol &gt; 100 mg/dL ; ( 5 ) Hypertension accord guideline require therapy . Smoking &gt; 2 packet cigarettes/day &gt; 12 month ; Prior total cholesterol level &gt; 400mg/dl ; BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2 ; Uncontrolled severe diabetes prior hospitalization due diabetic complication diagnosis ; For ETCAD patient : Uncontrolled severe hypertension cause hospitalization direct complication ; Serum creatinine ≥2.0 mg/dL ; Heart transplantation ; Active autoimmune disease ; Illicit drug use ; HIV positive ; Prior malignancy mediastinal irradiation , bone marrow transplantation highdose chemotherapy ; Adult congenital heart disease ; For healthy control , positive family history CAD FMD . Also , extension study , patient present rare , undiagnosed unusual form CAD ( e.g . unexplained dissection , fulminant calcification , aneurysms etc . ) FMD appropriate control , recruit , particularly strong family pedigree .</criteria>
