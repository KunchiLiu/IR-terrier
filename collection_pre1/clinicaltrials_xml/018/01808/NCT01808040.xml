	<brief_summary>In study investigator want find effect drug woman metastatic breast cancer . The study two major part ; dose escalation dose expansion . In first part dose escalation , subject treat low dose effective men : 300 mg two time daily . Orteronel ( TAK-700 ) increase reach high dose tolerate men : 400 mg two time daily . This part study design see female subject safely tolerate orteronel ( TAK-700 ) , measure change estrogens androgen different level TAK-700 . In second part study ( dose expansion ) , seven woman treat dose identify first part study safest effective . In part study , investigator want see orteronel ( TAK-700 ) routinely significantly decrease estrogen level dose use future study .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Voluntary write informed consent Patients 18 year old Screening clinical laboratory value specify : Serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) must upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN . Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN Estimated creatinine clearance use CockcroftGault formula must great 50 mL/minute Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great 1000/L platelet count great 75,000/L . Serum potassium level must within institutional normal limit . Serum magnesium phosphorous level must ≥ institutional low limit normal . Screening calculated ejection fraction great equal institutional upper limit normal Patients must histologically confirm breast cancer Metastatic OR Incurable locally advance Patients must histologically confirm HR+ breast cancer . Patients must measureable evaluable disease ECOG performance status &lt; 2 ( Karnofsky &gt; 60 % ) Patients must postmenopausal woman . Inclusion Criteria Dose Expansion Cohort : All criterion list addition : Patients must measurable disease . Patients may receive 1 prior line endocrine therapy metastatic setting . Patients may receive cytotoxic chemotherapy treatment metastatic setting . Exclusion Criteria Dose Escalation Cohort Patients meeting follow exclusion criterion enrol study . Patients discontinue prior medical therapy breast cancer ( exception bisphosphonates denosumab ) least 28 day prior first dose orteronel . Patients take form exogenous hormonal therapy within 28 day prior first dose orteronel . Patients receive radiotherapy within 14 day prior first dose orteronel . Patients recover baseline &lt; grade 1 allprior treatment related toxicity . EKG abnormality : Qwave infarction , unless identify 6 month prior screen QTc interval &gt; 470 msec , upper limit normal woman . Known hypersensitivity compound related orteronel orteronel excipients . Uncontrolled hypertension despite appropriate medical therapy Known active chronic hepatitis B C , lifethreatening illness unrelated cancer , serious medical psychiatric illness could , investigator 's opinion , potentially interfere participation study . Likely inability comply protocol cooperate fully investigator site personnel . Known gastrointestinal ( GI ) disease GI procedure could interfere GI absorption tolerance orteronel , include difficulty inability swallow tablet . Patients know endocrine disorder include , limited , Cushing 's , Addison 's disease . Patients know brain metastasis exclude unless definitive treatment ( e.g . whole brain radiotherapy surgery stereotactic radiation ) brain metastasis evidence stable/improved disease repeat image follow definitive treatment . Patients medication potential significant interaction orteronel . Patients serious medical illness Patients estimate life expectancy le 3 month determine treat physician . Prior therapy abiraterone , aminoglutethimide . Exclusion Criteria Dose Expansion Cohort Patients meeting follow exclusion criterion enrol study : They ineligible virtue meeting exclusion criterion . Patients know brain metastasis exclude portion clinical trial ( assess PFS TTP ) relatively poor overall prognosis . Patients HER2+ breast cancer also exclude portion study HER2targeted therapy would generally consider appropriate HER2+ patient population meeting entry criterion dose expansion cohort . They receive treatment orteronel another lyase inhibitor past . Diagnosed treat another malignancy within 2 year enrollment , exception situ malignancy .</criteria>
