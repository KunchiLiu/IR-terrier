	<brief_title>Testing Effectiveness Losartan Patients With EoE With Without CTD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Losartan drug approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use adult child 6 year age high blood pressure . Losartan safe administer patient normal blood pressure . This medication study people eosinophilic esophagitis connective tissue disorder . Eosinophils type white blood cell induces inflammation . Eosinophils inflammatory cell produce protein call TGF-β , may contribute part EoE . Losartan may reduce amount protein therefore , treatment eosinophilic esophagitis . You research study approximately 4 month . Participation research study involve 9 study visit . Of 9 study visit , least 3 visit take place clinic ; visit may take place telephone . Throughout study , follow activity occur : 1 . A physical vital sign obtain 2 . There two endoscopy perform one begin one end study 3 . Blood obtain three time 4 . Pregnancy test perform 5 . Quality-of-life questionnaire complete This open-label trial , mean choose enroll meet screen criterion , receive Losartan treatment . You start study drug low dose . It increase vist 3 1 month visit . The dose study drug increase depend weight well tolerate dose exceed 100mg study drug per day . It may increase decreased study side effect . If certain side effect , take dose study drug 21 28 day next study visit . You swallow pill liquid twice day . This study consist 4 phase : screening , treatment ( titration maintenance ) , end treatment , follow-up . Participants 5 18 year age , well parent legal guardian ask complete questionnaire quality-of-life symptom severity questionnaire . Participants age 19 21 also fill questionnaire , parents/guardians fill . If parent caretaker , study activity involve completion questionnaire family .</detailed_description>
