	<brief_title>Gene Analysis Studying Susceptibility Wilms Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To use genome-wide association analysis identify novel genetic variant confer susceptibility Wilms tumor . II . To improve understanding genetic architecture etiology Wilms tumor . III . To facilitate identification genetic marker associate increase risk develop Wilms tumor and/or risk aggressive disease , relapse , additional tumor and/or cancer offspring . OUTLINE : Samples analyze single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) profile use real-time polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification ( MLPA ) .</detailed_description>
