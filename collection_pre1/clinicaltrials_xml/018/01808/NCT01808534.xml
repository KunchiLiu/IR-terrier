	<brief_title>Palifosfamide Treating Patients With Recurrent Germ Cell Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate ( complete response [ CR ] +partial response [ PR ] ) single agent palifosfamide patient refractory germ cell tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine duration remission . II . To determine progression free overall survival . III . To assess toxicity tolerability palifosfamide patient germ cell tumor . OUTLINE : Patients receive palifosfamide intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 3 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
