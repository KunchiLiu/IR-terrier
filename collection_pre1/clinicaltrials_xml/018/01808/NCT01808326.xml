	<detailed_description>This study open-label , single arm , phase II study chlorambucil subject previously untreated CLL . The primary objective evaluate response chlorambucil Japanese subject previously untreated CLL . Secondary objective evaluate efficacy , safety pharmacokinetics chlorambucil Japanese subject . Chlorambucil effective well-tolerated chemotherapeutic agent currently approve treatment chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) United States America ( US ) , European Union ( EU ) country globally Japan . Other aggressive treatment option combination fludarabine ( F ) cyclophosphamide available , associate significantly great toxicity . The addition ofatumumab chlorambucil offer potentially effective therapy , limited additional toxicity . Study OMB110911 conduct mainly US EU evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall response ( OR ) subject previously untreated CLL ofatumumab combination chlorambucil versus ( vs. ) chlorambucil monotherapy . The objective study evaluate overall response chlorambucil Japanese subject previously untreated CLL .</detailed_description>
