	<detailed_description>efficacy assessment : - Histopathological finding base biopsy primary tumor location tissue excision end trial ( histological cure ) . - Description clinical-therapeutic effect resiquimod nBCC ( nodular-basal cell carcinoma ) visual inspection ( clinical evaluation treatment area assessment complete clinical clearance ) - RNA-analysis ( analysis gene expression cytokine , cytotoxic apoptotic signal ) - Investigator 's global judgment efficacy mean 7-point scale Safety assessment : - Evaluation Adverse Events ( AEs ) Serious Adverse Events ( SAEs ) - Evaluation local tolerability ( local skin reaction erythema , edema , erosion/ulceration , exsudate , dryness , encrustation ) mean symptom score scale ( 0 = absent , 1 = slight , 2 = moderate , 3 = severe , 4 = severe ) . - Evaluation systemic tolerability [ hematology ( erythrocyte , leucocytes include neutrophil , hemoglobin , hematocrit , thrombocyte ) , blood chemistry ( alkaline phosphatase , bilirubin , aspartate transaminase ( ASAT ) , alanine transaminase ( ALAT ) , serum creatinine ) , vital sign ] . The threshold concern laboratory abnormality determine patient 's discontinuation trial predefined upfront . - Evaluation number patient withdraw trial - Investigator 's global judgment tolerability mean 6-point scale - Photographic documentation treatment area Exploratory parameter : - C-reactive protein ( CRP ) - Interferon-alpha , interleukin-6 , interleukin-12 , interferon-gamma , TNF-alpha ( up-regulation gene expression ) - Immunohistochemistry characterization cell type ( CD8 , T-cells , macrophage , dendritic cell ) - In addition , blood serum sample preserve frozen later test specify patient . The preserved material store maximum 2 year .</detailed_description>
