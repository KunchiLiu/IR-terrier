There also report Nefopam manage pain inhibit serotonin reuptake receptor . In clinical practice , administration Nefopam patient require post-surgical pain management reduce use opioid analgesic 20-50 % also reduce prevalence nausea vomit . Therefore , investigator consider whether addition Nefopam intravenous patient-controlled analgesia patient lumbar spinal surgery would reduce side effect see monotherapy opioid analgesia result effective pain management .
