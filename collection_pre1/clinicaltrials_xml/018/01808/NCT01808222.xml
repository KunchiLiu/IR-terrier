	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer common solid tumor , approximately 200,000 new case diagnose per year . Several different local therapy available treatment ; include surgery radiotherapy Significant advance make improved cancer control outcomes treatment . Despite significant advance , approximately 30 % patient treat definitive local therapy experience recurrent disease . Recurrent ( return ) disease usually display rise PSA ( blood test prostate cancer ) . The PSA level often limited use differentiate local recurrence ( i.e . recurrence prostate bed ) recurrence outside prostate bed ( extra-prostatic recurrence ) . Imaging plays central role detection recurrent prostate carcinoma prostate bed differentiation prostatic extraprostatic recurrence . There new method image magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) molecular radiotracers currently study image post-therapy recurrence . One PET radiotracer show promise stag restaging patient prostate carcinoma anti-1-amino-3- [ 18F ] fluorocyclobutane-1-carboxylic acid ( anti-3- [ 18F ] FACBC ) synthetic amino acid analog . FACBC demonstrate high accuracy compare method restaging patient suspect recurrent prostate carcinoma . FACBC test 140 subject study Emory system include 128 subject prostate cancer . The investigator perform study 25 patient investigator strong suspicion prostate cancer return body initial treatment . The major goal investigation see whether anti- [ 18F ] FACBC PET-CT MRI image individually together useful detection local extraprostatic recurrence prostate cancer . Routine blood test do day FACBC scan one week later required FDA . All patient undergo biopsy prostate clinically appropriate per standard care . If either FACBC MRI scan indicate cancer recurrence , subject 's cancer site ( ) also biopsied clinically appropriate . Biopsy suspect recurrence site schedule subject ' convenience soon possible scan . Tissue obtain biopsy undergo standard analysis determine prostate carcinoma cell present . The secondary goal use left-over biopsy material determine genotypic difference prostate carcinoma recurrence confine prostate bed extraprostatic recurrence</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must 18 year age old . 2 . Patients originally diagnose localize ( Stage T1c , T2 , T3 ) prostate carcinoma undergone consider definitive nonprostatectomy therapy localize disease . 3 . In case cryotherapy , external beam radiation , HiFU procedure occur least one year past . In case brachytherapy , treatment occur least 2 year past eliminate patient socalled `` PSA bump . '' 4 . Patient suspicion recurrent prostate carcinoma define : ASTRORTOG Phoenix criterion nadir PSA +2 , absolute PSA ≥ 4.0 ng/ml.with double time ( DT ) PSA 2.03.99 ng/ml DT ≤10 month 5 . Ability lie still PET scan 6 . Patients must able provide write informed consent . 1 . Age less 18 . 2 . Greater T3 disease past and/or treat prostatectomy . 3 . Less 1 year since cryotherapy , external beam radiation therapy , HiFU 2 year since brachytherapy.. 4 . Does meet criterion suspicious PSA elevation 5 . Inability lie still PET scan 6 . Can provide write informed consent . 7 . Bone scan finding characteristic metastatic prostate carcinoma 8 . Less 1 month since prior prostate biopsy ( decrease false positive uptake inflammation ) .</criteria>
