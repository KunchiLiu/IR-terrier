	<brief_summary>This study investigate effect alter time day dose ( morning evening ) Fluticasone Furoate 100 ( FF 100 ) microgram ( mcg ) daily administer via dry powder inhaler ( DPI ) subject persistent bronchial asthma . This repeat-dose , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , three-way crossover study compare effect morning ( AM ) evening ( PM ) dose FF 100 lung function . Twenty-four male female subject persistent bronchial asthma enrol ensure twenty evaluable subject . The three treatment FF 100 AM ( placebo PM ) , FF 100 PM ( placebo AM ) match placebo ( AM PM ) . All treatment administer 14 ( +/-2 ) day 14 day run-in 14 21 day washout period . The total duration study approximately 13 to18 week subject .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subjects document history persistent asthma , exclusion significant pulmonary disease ( pneumonia , pneumothorax , atelectasis , pulmonary fibrotic disease , bronchopulmonary dysplasia , chronic bronchitis , emphysema , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , respiratory abnormality asthma ) . Male female 18 70 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . A female subject eligible participate : Of nonchildbearing potential define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use contraception method , wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrollment . For form HRT , least 2 4 week elapse cessation therapy blood draw ; interval depend type dosage HRT . Following confirmation postmenopausal status , resume use HRT study without use contraceptive method . Childbearing potential negative pregnancy test determine serum human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) test screen serum urine hCG test prior dose agrees use one contraception method appropriate period time ( determined product label investigator ) prior start dose sufficiently minimize risk pregnancy point . Female subject must agree use contraception completion follow visit samesex partner , prefer usual lifestyle . All subject must either clinically stable low mid dose inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) ( without short act beta2 receptor agonist [ SABA ] ) Fluticasone Propionate ( FP ) 100 to250 mcg twicedaily ( total daily dose 200 500 mcg ) equivalent , least 4 week precede screen visit clinically stable low dose ICS/ long act beta2 receptor agonist ( LABA ) combination , SERETIDE/ADVAIR 100/50 twice daily equivalent ( administer either combination separate inhaler ) , least 4 week precede screen visit . Higher ICS/LABA dos ( i.e . equivalent SERETIDE/ADVAIR 250/50 500/50 ) would acceptable . Subjects must refrain use LABA least 24 hour ( h ) prior screen visit Subjects screen prebronchodilator FEV1 &gt; = 60 percent predict . Predicted value base upon National Health Nutrition Examination Survey ( NHANES III ) . During screen visit , subject must demonstrate presence reversible airway disease , define increase FEV1 &gt; = 12.0 percent baseline absolute change &gt; = 200 mL within 60 minute follow 4 inhalation albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol ( equivalent nebulized treatment albuterol/salbutamol solution ) . All subject must able replace current asthma treatment albuterol/salbutamol aerosol inhaler screening use need runin period throughout duration study . Subjects LABAs must also withhold least 24 h prior screen visit . Subjects therefore SABA alone duration study , SABA FF FF treatment period . Subjects must able withhold albuterol/salbutamol least 6 h prior screen study visit . Subjects current nonsmoker pack history &lt; = 10 pack year . A subject may use inhale tobacco product within past 3 month ( i.e. , cigarette , cigar pipe tobacco ) .

Culturedocumented suspected bacterial viral infection upper low respiratory tract , sinus middle ear resolve within 4 week screen lead change asthma management , opinion Investigator , expect affect subject 's asthma status subject 's ability participate study . Any asthma exacerbation require oral corticosteroid within 12 week screen result overnight hospitalization require additional treatment asthma within 6 month prior screen . A subject clinically significant , uncontrolled condition disease state , opinion investigator , would put safety subject risk study participation would confound interpretation efficacy result condition/disease exacerbate study . The list additional excluded conditions/diseases include , limit following : congestive heart failure , know aortic aneurysm , clinically significant coronary heart disease , clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia , stroke within 3 month Visit 1 , uncontrolled hypertension , recent poorly control peptic ulcer , hematologic , hepatic , renal disease ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) , immunologic compromise , current malignancy , tuberculosis ( current untreated ) , Cushing 's disease , Addison 's disease , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , uncontrolled thyroid disorder , recent history drug alcohol abuse . Any adverse reaction include immediate delay hypersensitivity beta 2 agonist , sympathomimetic drug , intranasal , inhale , systemic corticosteroid therapy . Known suspected sensitivity constituent DPI ( i.e . lactose ) . History severe milk protein allergy . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . Use prescription nonprescription drug include vitamin , herbal dietary supplement ( include St John 's Wort ) within 7 day ( 14 day drug potential enzyme inducer ) 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study medication , unless opinion Investigator GSK Medical Monitor medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . Subjects take oral steroid within 12 week screen visit . History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study define Abuse alcohol define average weekly intake great 21 unit average daily intake great 3 unit ( male ) define average weekly intake great 14 unit average daily intake great 2 unit ( female ) .

Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day period . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product ( IP ) within follow time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Exposure four new chemical entity within 12 month prior first dose day . No subject permit perform night shift work 1 week prior screen completion study treatment period . Unwillingness inability follow procedure outline protocol . Exclusion Criteria Randomisation Treatment Resuming asthma medication ( exclude albuterol/salbutamol inhalation aerosol provide screening ) . Occurrence culturedocumented suspected bacterial viral infection upper low respiratory tract , sinus middle ear runin period lead change asthma management , opinion Investigator , expect affect subject 's asthma status subject 's ability participate study . Evidence severe exacerbation , define deterioration asthma require use systemic corticosteroid ( tablet , suspension injection ) least 3 day inpatient hospitalization emergency department visit due asthma require systemic corticosteroid screen Day 1 . Clinical visual evidence oral candidiasis Day 1 .</criteria>
