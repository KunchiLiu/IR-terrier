	<brief_summary>Background- In recurrent urinary tract infection ( RUTIs ) usual prophylactic antibiotic regime change long term risk recurrence . Objective- D-Mannose sugar , stick E. coli bacteria , aim study evaluate efficacy treatment prophylaxis recurrent UTIs . Design , set participants- : In crossover trial female patient eligible study recurrent UTIs , three ore episode precede 12 month . Suitable patient randomly assign antibiotic treatment trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole regimen oral D Mannose 24 week , receive intervention second phase study . Outcome measurement statistical analysis- The time recurrence UTI , bladder pain ( VAS p ) urinary urgency ( VAS u ) evaluate end antibiotic therapy 24 week fo D Mannose . The result quantitative variable express mean value SD normally distribute ( Shapiro-Wilk test ) . T-test paired data use analyze difference time recurrence , VAS pain , Vas urgency number voiding treatment .

	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Urinary tract infection ( UTIs ) among common infectious disease , substantial financial burden society . In Europe data presence various type UTIs indicate high impact quality life people affect , important impact urinary tract infection economy general health system particular . In U.S. urinary tract infection account 7 million doctor visit year , include 2 million visit cystitis . The bacterium E. coli , source 90 % urinary tract infection , show incredible ability survive human body , able change rapidly survive antibiotic . An infection urinary tract must stop begin migrate kidney , cause serious infection . Women frequent reinfections rate 0.13 0.22 UTIs per month ( 1.6 2.6 infection per year ) . For premenopausal , healthy , active female , recurrent UTIs major healthcare concern . Recurrent urinary tract infection ( RUTI ) define three episode urinary tract infection ( UTI ) 3 positive urine culture previous 12 month two episode last six month . The usual present strategy employ prophylactic antibiotic regime prevent recurrent UTIs include long-term low-dose prophylactic antimicrobial treatment postcoital antibiotic treatment . However , seem strategy alter long-term risk recurrence . Patients frequent UTIs take prophylactic antimicrobial agent extend period decrease infection prophylaxis , rate infection return pre-treatment rate prophylaxis stop . Long-term antibiotic appear positively affect patient 's basic susceptibility infection . The cell wall E. coli bacteria tiny finger-like projection contain complex molecule call lectin surface . These lectin act cellular glue bind bacteria bladder wall easily rinse urination . In pilot study aim evaluate oral D Mannose could use safe effective treatment prophylactic measure recurrent UTIs adult woman . PATIENTS AND METHODS Suitable female patient recurrent urinary tract infection visit outpatient Clinic Urology Department eligible study . The work conduct accordance principle Declaration Helsinki World Medical Association . Patients enrol study treatment recent urinary tract infection positive urinary culture time . Each participant enter trial assign one follow treatment random sequence : 1 . A regimen five-day antibiotic therapy trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 160 mg/800 mg twice day . Then 1 week antibiotic every 4 week follow 23 week 2 . A regimen oral D Mannose 1 gr . 3 time day , every 8 hour 2 week , subsequently 1 gr . twice day 22 week . D-Mannose best activity urine neutral pH , therefore patient instructed measure urinary pH use dipstick use oral sodium bicarbonate 250 mg b.i.d.or potassium citrate 1 gr . b.i.d . alkalinize agent pH &lt; 7 . Patients randomly assign antibiotic treatment trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole regimen oral D Mannose 24 week , receive intervention second phase study . VAS score bladder pain ( VASp ) urgency ( VASu ) evaluate start D Mannose 24 week . The 24 hour number voiding obtain fill void diary end treatment D Mannose . Cure define resolution symptom post-treatment bacteriuria 24 week follow-up visit . Cure recurrence define resolution symptom negative culture 12 week follow significant UTI bacteriuria 24 week . Failure define persistent symptom significant bacteriuria 24 week . The cure rate determine patient meet infection criterion , return follow-up visit treat antimicrobial recurrent urinary tract infection occur twice times 6 month precede 24 week course daily oral D Mannose . The time recurrence UTI , VAS pain VAS urgency evaluate end antibiotic therapy end 24 week treatment oral D Mannose . Statistical Analysis- The result quantitative variable express mean value SD normally distribute ( Shapiro-Wilk test ) . T-test paired data use analyze difference time recurrence , VAS pain , Vas urgency number voiding treatment . Data analysis perform STATA statistical package ( release 11,1 , 2010 , Stata Corporation , College Station , Texas , USA ) . DISCUSSION- The approach management recurrent urinary tract infection usually treat adequately episode infection completion document complete eradication urine culture ; infection reoccurs persists image require . In management recurrent UTIs woman common practice fight resistance bacterium E. coli vary type antibiotic , increase dose duration therapy . However , bacteria become even resistant broad spectrum antibiotic . Moreover , resistance bacterium would increase infection due new E. coli contamination faeces sexual contact . What actually appear occur survival part old colony bacteria urinary tract , remain latent reactivate various favourable condition , relentless recurrence therefore consider reinfection . It could learn lot patient research do cause repeat urinary tract infection , especially due bacterium E. coli . Uropathogenic Escherichia coli ( UPEC ) strain may contain virulence factor allow bacteria penetrate transitional cell form quiescent intracellular reservoir ( QIRs ) . Establishment QIRs throughout underlie transitional epithelium may predispose individual increase likelihood recurrence may account frequent same-strain recurrence see clinically despite appropriate antibiotic therapy . A difficult aspect treat urinary tract infection woman high likelihood recurrence . In series trial group susceptible woman average 2.6 infection per patient per year despite apparent effectiveness short-term therapy . While long-term prophylaxis relatively effective series , resistance trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole urinary pathogen increase 19 % 5-year period . Although debate regard duration antibiotic therapy , emergence drug-resistant organism consider prolonged antibiotic use , even healthy woman uncomplicated UTIs . A number trigger lead reactivation dormant E.coli already bladder , release E.coli pod behind biofilms bladder . When first UTI cause E. coli , risk second infection within 6 month great first infection cause another uropathogen . Although E. coli frequently isolate microorganism group patient , limited number patient study could confirm assumption . The chemical structure D-Mannose cause stick E. coli bacteria , maybe even tenaciously E. coli adhere human cell . Although mechanism work complicate , theoretically , enough D-mannose present urine , bind bacteria prevents attach urinary tract lining . Our clinical experience show D Mannose represent useful choice address problem recurrent UTIs . The time require develop new infection , re-emergence bacterial reservoir , assume new data , significantly longer prolonged course oral D Mannose antibiotic treatment , even use long period low dose , cycle . We actually know mannose bactericidal property , might well dosage duration therapy individualize accord bacterial growth replication speed bladder urinary tract . The major part mannose ingest eliminated urine work bind bacteria concentrate infected urine attempt perpetuate infection bind mannose receptor urothelial bladder cell , mechanism one involve case recurrence . In case recurrence wrongly regard re-infections : highly likely bactericidal molecule possess property produce consistent effect , elimination load bacteria urine , `` alive '' albeit inactivate , motionless , devoid pathogenic potential due mannose link .</detailed_description>
