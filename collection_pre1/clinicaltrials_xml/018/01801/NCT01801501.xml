	<brief_title>Role FGF-23 Prognosis Biomarker Intensive Care Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Observational study patient admit Critical Care Unit ( CCU ) University Chile Clinical Hospital , admit diagnosis severe sepsis/septic shock . Exclusion criterion : Pregnancy , organ transplantation . Informed consent solicit patient admission study . If patient give his/her clinical condition , solicit patient representative . After admission CCU achievement inform consent , venous blood sample obtain , determinate plasmatic level Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 ( FGF-23 ) . New sample obtain 24 48 hour admission . Determination FGF-23 perform ELISA technique Integrated Physiology laboratory . Demographics , clinical biochemical data also obtain . The data collect Principal Investigator . Confidentially data preserve completion study . The study divide 2 part : 1 . - Evaluation sample 14 patient determinate impact FGF-23 predict presence severity Acute Kidney Injury ( AKI ) , estimate sample size predict primary outcome . 2 . - Evaluation large sample , determinate impact FGF-23 predict primary outcome . Primary outcome : 1 . - Development acute kidney injury 2 . - Severity AKI , determinate AKIN classification 3 . - In-hospital mortality Secondary outcome : 1 . - Requirements renal replacement therapy 2 . - Requirements mechanical ventilation 3 . - Requirements vasoactive drug 4 . - Duration ICU stay hospital stay The protocol approve Ethical Committee University Chile Clinical Hospital . The study monitor Clinical Investigation Support Office ( OAIC ) hospital .</detailed_description>
