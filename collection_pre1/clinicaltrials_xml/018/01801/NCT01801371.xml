	<brief_summary>This open-label brain PET/CT ( positron emission tomography/computed tomography ) study investigate diagnostic performance evaluation efficacy 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 glioma patient . A single dose nearly 111 MBq 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 ( ≤40 µg BNOTA-PRGD2 ) intravenously injected patient suspicion glioma . Visual semiquantitative method use assess PET/CT image . Brain MRI with/without enhancement 18F-FDG PET/CT perform comparison . The postoperative pathology integrin αvβ3 CD34 immunohistochemical stain also use correlation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Integrin αvβ3 important member integrin receptor family express preferentially various type tumor cell activate endothelial cell tumor angiogenesis , low quiescent vessel cell normal cell . Therefore , integrin αvβ3 receptor become valuable target diagnosis response evaluation malignant tumor . The tri-peptide sequence arginine-glycine-aspartic acid ( RGD ) specifically bind integrin αvβ3 receptor . Accordingly , variety radio-labeled RGD-based peptide develop non-invasive imaging integrin αvβ3 receptor expression via positron emission tomography ( PET ) single photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) . Among RGD radiotracers , several PET image agent , include 18F-Galacto-RGD 18F-AH111585 , investigated clinical trial tumor diagnosis , result demonstrate radiotracers allow specific image various type tumor , tumor uptake correlate well expression integrin αvβ3 . Recently , serial RGD dimeric peptide PEG linkers study . The new type RGD peptides show much high vitro integrin αvβ3-binding affinity single RGD tri-peptide sequence , importantly , exhibit significantly increase tumor uptake improve vivo kinetics animal model . As representative , 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 could easily prepare exhibited excellent vivo behavior animal model . No adverse reaction observe animal model date . For interest clinical translation 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 , open-label brain PET/CT study design investigate diagnostic performance evaluation efficacy 68Ga-BNOTA-PRGD2 pre-surgery glioma patient .</detailed_description>
