	<detailed_description>Mycosis Fungoides ( MF ) rare malignancy United States . It common form cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) . Sézary syndrome ( SS ) severe leukemic form CTCL . Severe pruritus manifestation SS also affect patient MF . Severe pruritus manifestation SS also common symptom among patient MF . Pruritus significantly impact quality life . In one national survey impact MF patient ' health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) , majority survey respondent ( 88 % ) report bothered pruritus . The pathogenesis pruritus complex well understood . It affect majority patient mycosis fungoides ( MF ) severe Sézary syndrome ( SS ) , leukemic form cutaneous T-cell lymphoma . Chemical physical stimulus perturb , without damaging , epidermis ( outer layer skin ) , elicit symptom pruritus . The perception itch abolish epidermis remove . This observation data PAR2 expression nerve fiber indicate pruritus inflammatory skin disorder include MF/SS likely neuroepidermal origin mediate molecule percolate epidermis inflammatory cell dermis . In regard , MF/SS characterize histologically infiltration epidermis neoplastic T cell ( epidermotropism ) , case , neoplastic cell form collection 2-3 cell around epidermal Langerhans cell ( Pautrier microabscess ) . Neoplastic cell advance MF/SS typically polarize secrete TH2 cytokine . It hypothesize accumulation neoplastic cell skin lesion promote shift TH1 predominant cytokine profile early MF TH2 predominant cytokine profile advance disease 4 . The shift TH2 production coincides impair immune response , eosinophilia , high level IgE blood . Severe pruritus frequent patient advance MF/SS suggest tumor burden cytokine elaborate activated tumor cell may correlate intensity pruritus . While clear cell contribute TH2 cytokine shift , study T-cells isolate skin blood affect patient show activation signal molecule , STAT3 . In CTCL line , constitutively activate STAT3 mediate IL-5 production ( principal regulator eosinophilia ) IL-13 ( favor antibody response ) 5 . Moreover , IL-31 also seem signal STAT3 one lung model . Current treatment pruritus aim towards symptomatic relief although address mechanism pruritus . If neoplastic cell produce IL-31 pruritogenic factor propose , treatment eliminates cell also effective pruritus . To date , effectively improve pruritus disease manifestation always possible especially advanced MF SS . Vorinostat FDA approve histone deacetylase inhibitor treatment cutaneous manifestation patient cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( MF/SS ) progressive , persistent , recurrent disease follow 2 systemic therapy . Vorinostat induce differentiation , growth arrest , and/or apoptosis malignant cell vitro vivo show clinical response approximately 30 % patient advance MF/SS 7 . Overall , 32 % patient severe pruritus relief symptom , observed relief pruritus often presage clinical response , especially SS . This suggest u gene modulate effect vorinostat might directly inhibit expression IL-31 cytokine mediate pruritus MF/SS . IL-31 appear implicated pruritus atopic dermatitis . 8 Recently , study demonstrate itch mediate novel cysteine protease proteinase-activated receptor-2 play important role itch signal pathway . 9 , 10 In another recent study , substance P implicate itch pathophysiology . In one small case series patient CTCL , efficacy aprepitant evaluated11 . Aprepitant substance P antagonist block neurokinin 1 ( NK1 ) receptor . Substance P role physiology unmyelinated C-fibers skin convey pain pruritus ability modulate mast cell function . Data skin biopsy show successful treatment vorinostat associate decrease dermal epidermal lymphocyte , shift nuclear cytoplasmic p-STAT-3 staining , decrease CD31-positive dermal vessel . This confirm another study . Vorinostat postulate indirectly inactivate STAT protein drive cellular proliferation TH2 cytokine expression . Researchers observe skin biopsy patient enrol vorinostat stage IIB trial , nuclear accumulation STAT1 high level nuclear pSTAT3 malignant T cell correlate lack clinical response . To date , evaluation STAT3 proteins TH2 cytokine pruritic versus non-pruritic skin lesion CTCL . Signal transducer activator transcription ( STATS ) important active transcription cellular protein include cytokine . Constitutive activation STATs show feature MF/SS . Study Rationale : Since pruritus common manifestation disease significantly impact patient 's quality life oral vorinostat provide clinical relief pruritus treat patient , understand mechanisms action vorinostat cytokine implicate pruritus shed light therapeutic effect . In particular , believe reduction pSTAT3 activity evidence few and/or less strongly stain tumor cell may take place patient respond therapy reporting decrease pruritus . Thus , understand extent STAT3 protein aberration cytokine expression ( IL-31 ) pruritic skin lesion could significantly contribute understand mechanism pruritus MF/SS vorinostat relieve serious symptom . Objectives/Hypothesis It hypothesize skin tissue expression pSTAT3 , IL-31 , cathepsin S correlate response vorinostat , recently FDA approve therapy MF SS , decrease expression relief pruritus . Methods : Dosing Frequency Drug Participants care Boston Medical Center first assess physician CTCL multi-specialty clinic vorinostat , administer per standard care , appropriate therapy CTCL . The decision invite patient participate study ( 1 ) separate describe clinical decision utilize vorinostat , ( 2 ) offer subsequent clinical decision utilize vorinostat . There placebo group study . Up ten participant desire study . Three biopsies take : ( 1 ) baseline ; ( 2 ) 4 week 300 mg daily vorinostat , ( 3 ) tolerate , 4 week 400 mg daily vorinostat . At time point , 2 biopsy take depend 1 skin type present ( itchy v non-itchy ) time point whether itchy non-itchy skin show lesion . For time point skin type , pSTAT3 staining measure strong ( 2+ ) , weak ( 1+ ) , none ( 0 ) . At time point , patient report extent pruritus visual analogue score ( VAS ) 0-100 mm ( 0 , pruritus ; 100 , worst imaginable pruritus ) . Meaningful change pruritus change VAS score 30 mm baseline third time point ( change measure also compute endpoint ; baseline time 3 measure primary clinical interest ) . Sample Size/Accrual Rate : The total enrollment plan 10 patient rate 1-2 patient per month . With 10 subject , primary hypothesis ( correlation stain intensity self-reported degree pruritis ) detect Spearman rank correlation coefficient small 0.75 one-sided test 80 % power ( directional hypothesis reasonable ) one small 0.80 two-sided hypothesis . In case , coefficient clear clinical relevance plausible give nature measure . For hypothesis equal change treat control area individual , propose use pair data analysis pair t-tests Wilcoxon rank sum test . For sample size 10 80 % power , pair t-test detect effect size 0.996 great two-sided test effect size 0.853 great one-sided test . These effect size large within reason expect clinically effective treatment .</detailed_description>
