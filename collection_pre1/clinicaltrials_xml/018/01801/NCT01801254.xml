	<brief_summary>The field neuroeconomics begin elucidate neural mechanism underlie self-control ; however , researcher yet harness neuroeconomics finding develop intervention improve self-control ability . The investigator currently develop intervention . The investigator ' approach involve use brain-computer interface audiovisual feedback show people happen brain , real time . Through interface , individual train increase level neural activity may facilitate self-control , , turn , may improve ability exhibit self-controlled behavior . This may increase ability engage heath behavior self-control require ( eg , diet exercise ) . The investigator ' long-term goal create tool help people develop self-control need achieve last improvement health behavior .</brief_summary>
