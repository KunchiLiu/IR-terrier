	<brief_title>A Prospective Study Evaluating Treatment Forehead and/or Glabellar Lines With Cryo-Touch IV Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The development facial rhytids wrinkle natural part age process , result thin dermis epidermis due loss elastic fiber collagen subcutaneous fat loss . Contributors formation facial rhytids include exposure ultraviolet light ( sunlight ) gravity , well habitual facial expression cause line occur specific facial region skin lose elasticity . In case , hyperdynamic activity underlie facial muscle lead development furrow glabella frontalis area . Activity facial muscle cause hyperdynamic line independent age process also undesirable . With age population , demand facial rejuvenation technique increase . A range treatment option develop provide reduction facial line , include topical medication , neuromuscular inhibiting injection , laser treatment , cosmetic filler , surgical facelift . Those option target specifically hyperdynamic furrow include botulinum toxin injection , injectable filler , surgical resection facial muscle division motor nerve . Although botulinum toxin injection become popular approach reduction glabellar line provide partial chemical denervation glabellar muscle complex , safety concern exist relate use toxin . Injectable filler mitigate underlying muscular activity produce facial furrow . Surgical strategy limit risk complication typically associate surgery , include bleeding , bruising , scar , infection . A non-surgical , minimally invasive approach elimination facial hyperdynamic line avoids use chemical toxin desirable . myoscience Inc. ( Redwood City , CA ) develop device novel , minimally invasive facial rejuvenation procedure design soften hyperdynamic facial line . The myoscience Cryo-Touch IV device use well-established principle cryobiology cause localize reduction muscle activity result reversible reduction facial animation appearance facial line .
