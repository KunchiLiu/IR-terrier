	<brief_summary>This call `` Aim 1 '' investigator ' NIH grant . Ondansetron ( Zofran ) safe effective drug use pregnant woman prevent nausea investigator know effect pregnancy may metabolism Zofran pregnant woman baby . Therefore investigator enroll approximately 40 pregnant woman baby draw blood sample mother , baby cord , determine much Zofran sample blood ( call pharmacokinetics PK Zofran ) . The pregnant woman receive Zofran , standard-of-care drug , schedule Cesarean Section . The investigator also enroll 20 non-pregnant woman undergo surgery receive Zofran standard-of-care surgery . In pregnant &amp; non-pregnant woman , investigator draw blood sample time point base number minute time Zofran give . The blood data ( PK Zofran ) help investigator move Aim 2 study , do pregnant , narcotic-addicted mother baby bear addict narcotic . Aim 2 list separately interventional study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This phase study Aim 1 lead Aim 2 , specifically address Prevention Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome ( NAS ) . NAS constellation narcotic drug withdrawal symptom develop 42-94 % infant bear narcotic dependent mother . This severe syndrome , preventative treatment , result prolonged hospitalization , may neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) . The investigator show ondansetron eliminate alleviate symptom narcotic drug withdrawal experimental study mice human . Based upon result , quite possible ondansetron administration pregnant narcotic-using mother prior delivery , follow 3-day period ondansetron administration neonate , could reduce incidence severity NAS symptom . AIM 1 pharmacokinetic ( PK ) study intravenous ( IV ) ondansetron three different group participant : Study Group # 1 = non-pregnant woman undergo surgery ; Study Group # 2 = pregnant woman schedule cesarean section delivery ; Study Group # 3 = viable , full term , singleton neonate bear study group # 2 mother . Group # 1 give IV ondansetron prior surgery 5 PK blood sample draw indwell IV line IV stick . The PK sample 2-5 ml drawn baseline ( prior ondansetron ) 7 , 15 , 40 min 8 hour ondansetron . Group # 2 give IV ondansetron prior cesarean section 6 PK blood sample draw indwell IV line IV stick . The PK sample 2-5 ml drawn baseline , 7 , 15 , 40 min prior delivery 8 hour ondansetron give . The Group # 3 neonate provide section umbilical cord arterial venous blood sample draw ( section cord would normally throw parent consent allow Investigators take two sample ) . Each time baby `` Standard-of-Care '' lab test order heel stick needle stick , investigator obtain drop blood place special research filter paper determine much ondansetron baby 's blood . If parent allow extra heel stick , Investigators try obtain 1-2 sample blood first 6 hour life . If parent want baby 's blood take standard-of-care lab draw , first schedule lab draw 24 hour life newborn screen mandate state law . All blood sample take study process investigator , Stanford Lab . Also , investigator PK analysis dry blood spot filter paper analysis frozen plasma sample . Aim 2 NIH grant enter separately ClinicalTrials.gov . It multi-center , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial determine whether ondansetron treatment reduce incidence severity NAS baby bear narcotic-using mother .</detailed_description>
