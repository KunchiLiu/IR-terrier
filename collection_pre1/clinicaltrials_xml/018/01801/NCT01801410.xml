These intervention could optimize care pathway woman need induction labour . This especially important low resource setting improvement need potential reduce maternal neonatal mortality morbidity great . The ideal induction agent would result relatively short induction delivery interval without risk fetus low rate emergency caesarean section . The induction delivery interval especially important pre-eclampsia eclampsia condition may deteriorate rapidly delivery . Inductions prostaglandin , include misoprostol , sometimes associate uterine hyperstimulation consequent fetal hypoxia , whilst effectiveness safety Foley catheter induction agent persistently question . This study identify risk , benefit trade-off efficacy , safety , acceptability cost two low cost induction method .</brief_summary>
