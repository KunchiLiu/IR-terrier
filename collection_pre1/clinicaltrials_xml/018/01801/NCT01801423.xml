	<brief_summary>Given large absolute number individual sickle cell disease Nigeria , hydroxyurea therapy individual sickle cell disease may initially feasible ; however , target strategy hydroxyurea use primary prevention stroke alternative standard therapy ( observation ) high-risk individual . The investigator propose feasibility study , Sickle Cell Disease - Stroke Prevention Nigeria ( SPIN ) Trial , determine whether hydroxyurea use primary prevention stroke Nigerian child sickle cell anemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sickle Cell Disease - Stroke Prevention Nigeria Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sickle cell disease ( SCD ) common genetic disease world . Approximately 150,000 Nigerian child bear year SCD , make country large burden sickle cell disease world . SCD common cause stroke child result considerable morbidity affect child . The current primary prevention approach regular monthly blood transfusion therapy child high risk stroke ( identify elevate transcranial Doppler measurement ) feasible low income country Nigeria due scarcity supply , cost , high rate blood borne infection . In United States , hydroxyurea ( HU ) standard therapy adult SCD may reasonable prevention alternative regular blood transfusion treatment primary stroke high-risk child . Given large absolute number individual SCD Nigeria , HU therapy individual SCD may initially feasible ; however , target strategy HU use primary prevention stroke alternative standard therapy ( observation ) high-risk individual . Study investigator therefore propose feasibility study determine acceptability HU primary prevention stroke Nigerian child sickle cell anemia ( SCA ) preparation National Institute Health ( NIH ) sponsor Phase III Trial . Investigators establish safety protocol use HU clinical trial set complete necessary preparation definitive phase III trial . To accomplish aim study investigator assemble strong multidisciplinary team represent Vanderbilt University two premier in-country institution : Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital , Nigeria , Friends Global Health-Nigeria . Completion definitive trial benefit child SCA sub-Saharan Africa , majority child SCA live world , could provide reasonable evidence alternative blood transfusion therapy primary prevention stroke US . To knowledge would first stroke prevention trial Nigeria could establish precedent expand secondary stroke prevention child adult SCA , regrettably , therapy available prevent recurrent stroke high-risk patient resource-poor nation .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Screening : Patients hemoglobin SS S beta zero thalassemia confirm hemoglobin electrophoresis ; Informed consent parent legal guardian assent participant age 5 12 ; Successful completion screen procedure : cerebral blood flow velocity â‰¥ 200 cm/sec terminal portion middle cerebral artery ; Patient must 5 12 year age ( i.e. , must attain 5th 13th birthday consent sign ) . Exclusion Criteria Screening : Prior overt stroke ( focal neurological deficit acute onset ) history , focal neurological deficit standardize neurological examination , concern moderate severe neurological deficit ( could due stroke ) base positive `` 10 question '' screening ( establish tool resource poor country ) . ( 2,3 ) A `` positive '' screening define answer yes one 10 question . The negative predictive value ( child moderate several neurological impairment ) `` 10 question '' great 94 % child ( 2 ) ; Other exclusion : significant cytopenia [ absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &lt; 1500/ul , platelet &lt; 150,000/ul , reticulocytes &lt; 80,000/ul , unless Hb &gt; 9 g/dl ] , renal insufficiency ( creatinine &gt; 0.8 mg/dl ) ; significant organ system dysfunction , contraindication hydroxyurea therapy ; history seizures diagnosis epilepsy ; Patients hydroxyurea therapy consideration prior study consent/education ; Patients previously treat hydroxyurea consider restart hydroxyurea therapy ; Other significant organ system dysfunction ; Any condition chronic illness , opinion site 's Principal Investigator ( PI ) make participation illadvised unsafe . Participants child bear age pregnant may become pregnant take hydroxyurea . If participant becomes pregnant study , hydroxyurea treatment stop immediately . The onsite notify clinical coordinating center principal investigator case . The site principal investigator study principal investigator determine therapy participant receive pregnancy standard care . Inclusion Criteria Study Therapy : Successful completion screening procedure inclusive cerebral blood flow velocity great equal 200 cm/sec measure twice least one measurement great equal 220 cm/sec terminal portion middle cerebral artery two TCD measurement 190 cm/sec within three month interval ; Informed consent parent legal guardian study therapy assent participant complete ; Participant able swallow capsule observe study personnel ; Acceptance hydroxyurea therapy one year . After one year therapy , participant option continue therapy follow visit monitor adherence therapy . Exclusion Criteria Treatment Group : Unable commit follow visit course study . Inclusion Criteria participant eligible receive hydroxyurea therapy , follow one year ( control group ) : Successful completion screening procedure inclusive cerebral blood flow velocity less equal 199 cm/sec terminal portion middle cerebral artery ; Informed consent parent legal guardian assent participant ; Acceptance follow one year study . Hydroxyurea may give reason part participant 's ongoing care , give part study . Exclusion Criteria treatment control group : Unable commit follow visit course study .</criteria>
