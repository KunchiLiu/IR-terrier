	<brief_summary>Background : Low level cardiorespiratory fitness associate high risk non-communicable disease all-cause mortality . Physical activity level primary determinant cardiorespiratory fitness adult . However , knowledge motivate people engage physical activity maintain active lifestyle lacking . This study aim investigate whether motivational , individual , locally anchor exercise intervention , primary care , improve cardiorespiratory fitness 30 49 year old low low cardiorespiratory fitness . Design : Randomised control trial 6 12 month follow-up . The primary outcome cardiorespiratory fitness . Secondary outcome include biochemical parameter ( HbA1C , HDL- LDL-cholesterol , triglyceride ) , physical activity level ( measure accelerometer ) , self-reported physical activity , anthropometric parameter health-related quality life . Methods : Cardiorespiratory fitness estimate via maximal incremental exercise test express index maximum oxygen uptake per minute divide body weight ( ml O2/kg/min ) . A total 236 participant , classify low low cardiorespiratory fitness local health check programme , ( correspond ≤ 39 ≤35 ml O2/kg/min . 30-39 40-49 year-old men respectively ≤33 ≤31 ml O2/kg/min . 30-39 40-49 year-old woman respectively ) , randomise two group . The intervention group receive 4 motivational interview , six month membership sport club , global positioning watch upload training activity social medium . The comparison group receive standard care : one hour motivational interview . In addition Intention-to-treat analysis per-protocol analysis perform . Effect intervention estimate evaluate difference mean change cardiorespiratory fitness two group . Discussion : In new innovative way focus study improve cardiorespiratory fitness among 30-49 year-old at-risk group use social medium , GPS-technology , on-going personal support individually tailor physical activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background It well know low level cardiorespiratory fitness associate high risk noncommunicable disease cause mortality , improvement cardiorespiratory fitness decrease risk especially among least fit ( 1-5 ) . Although cardiorespiratory fitness genetic contribution , physical activity habit primary determinant cardiorespiratory fitness adult , change physical activity level result change cardiorespiratory fitness ( 2,6 ) . Thus World Health Organization recommend adult age 18-64 least 150 minute moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity least 75 minute vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity weekly equivalent combination moderate- vigorous-intensity activity . In Denmark estimate 32 % fullfill recommendation ( 7 ) improve physical activity among group people great importance public health . In primary care several simple- multicomponent physical activity intervention conduct order increase physical activity . However , result intervention remain inconsistent . In addition , content intervention often unclearly describe , particularly relation intensity fidelity intervention delivery review reveal study use self-reported measure physical activity ( 8,9 ) . These issue warrant well-described intervention study use objectively measure physical activity specifically design , evaluate primary care setting . In Denmark , `` Check health '' programme aim screening individual ( n≈26,500 ) municipality Randers age 30-49 year cardiovascular disease 5-year period . Identifying people insufficiently active people low cardiorespiratory fitness one central objective programme do self-reported objective measure physical activity cardiorespiratory fitness . To perform successful intervention , strategy techniques motivate guide people adopt healthy choice need identify . Some may accomplish close supervision personal instruction healthcare professional apply communication skill motivational interviewing ( 10,11 ) , find effective approach change behaviour . This method specifically offer promise improvement cardiovascular health status ( 12 ) . Furthermore , key issue adopt modern technology social medium intervention ( 13 ) . A Danish report support idea concludes particularly 30-50 year old , age-group always give high priority regular physical activity due lack time commitment job/further education establishment family , motivate social medium technology ( 14-16 ) . Finally , also suggest physical activity intervention integrate structure broad range community-based organisation e.g . sport club order offer wide range activity , thereby individualise anchor physical activity locally ( 17 ) . Using combination motivational interviewning , social medium , technology community organisation may build individual capability organisational capacity behaviour change , create new social norm , promote policy environmental change support high level physical activity across population long-term . We therefore hypothesise locally anchor `` primary care package '' contain social medium technology , ongoing personal support individually tailor flexible physical activity improve cardiorespiratory fitness among 30-49 year-olds low cardiorespiratory fitness . 1 . The design study evaluate efficacy motivational , individual locally anchor exercise intervention primary care aim improve cardiorespiratory fitness among 30 49 year old low level cardiorespiratory fitness . 2 . The actual intervention level detail allow replication . METHODS Study design The study conduct single ( researcher ) blind randomise control trial higly explanatory attitude deliver optimal condition possible ( 18 ) . Sample size This study calculate detect 3 ml/kg/minute ( sd 6 ) difference intervention- comparison group end 6 month . The sample size calculation base unpuplished data another randomise control health screen programme Denmark show difference cardiorespiratory fitness 2,1 ( sd 6 ) five year period previous study compare 6 24 month intervention effect lifestyle physical activity program reporting difference 3.64 ( sd 3,5 ) 1.34 ( sd 3.37 ) ml/kg/minute respectively ( 19 ) . With power 90 % use two-sided p=0.05 test , sample size least 85 group necessary . To accommodate non-independence within couple , use robust variance estimation obtain valid uncertainty estimate extra 6 participant group add sample size . Anticipating drop-out 30 % , total 118 participant include group . Participants A volunteer sample 236 participant low low cardiorespiratory fitness recruit `` Check health '' programme MILE-study . Intervention group The intervention six month `` primary care package '' base motivational , individual locally anchored physical activity . The content elaborate follow : Physical activity The participant receive six-month free membership Randers Gymnastic Club , nonprofit local sport club geographically situate middle Randers municipality.The activity take place open class member Randers Gymnastic Club deliver experienced trained instructor . The participant decide whether attend activity Randers Gymnastic Club , moderate/vigorous/high intensity physical activity sport club . Virtual software platform The participant require upload training activity pulse data least week virtual software platform Endomondo.com via global positioning system ( GPS ) -watch ( Garmin Forerunner 210 ) . Motivational interview The intervention group receive four motivational interview - baseline , three week three six month . The purpose interview support guide participant kind physical activity suit everyday life . The first interview 90-minute long `` face face '' interview Randers Gymnastic Club include introduction Randers Gymnastic Club , GPS-watch upload train data Endomondo.com . The two ensue interview 15-minute telephone interview include status uploaded activity instructor access , finally 30-minute face face interview conduct . The motivational interview deliver trained fitness instructor Randers Gymnastic Club , total 8 hour train guide principle underlie motivational interview . Comparison group Each participant comparison group invite one-hour motivational interview ( 11 ) current activity level , motivation different option increase physical activity level . The interview conduct experienced internationally certified coach Randers Health Care Centre , follow second meeting , request . This current standard care municipality . Data analysis The primary analysis base intention-to-treat principle ; however per-protocol analysis also perform . Effect intervention VO2max estimate difference mean change 6 12 month intervention group comparison group . Furthermore subgroup analysis regard gender perform . A Student t-test nonparametric test use normally unevenly distribute data , respectively . Loss follow-up analysis conduct via baseline characteristic Check health Danish Registers . Results present 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) p value . P value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
