	<brief_summary>Background : - Deficiency IL-1 receptor antagonist ( DIRA ) condition cause repeat episodes inflammation . People DIRA rash , fever , joint pain . Most treatment DIRA intend control immune system stop inflammation . There drug treat DIRA , give daily injection . Researchers want try another drug , rilonacept , treatment DIRA . It need give week . Rilonacept give individual least 3 month old DIRA . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness rilonacept child adult DIRA . Eligibility : - Individuals least 3 month old DIRA . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . Other test study pain movement give . Imaging study bone density scan x-ray may also take . - Participants minimum four five study visit 12 month . Those different anti-inflammatory drug ( anakinra ) stop take begin study visit . - Participants rilonacept injection weekly study . The dose adjust need help treat DIRA symptom . Participants keep diary monitor symptom side effect . - Treatment rilonacept give 1 year . Participants study visit monitor treatment . They provide blood sample test study visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rilonacept Deficiency Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist ( DIRA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Autoinflammatory disease illnesses characterized episode inflammation , unlike autoimmune disorder , lack production high titer autoantibody antigen-specific T cell . There grow genetic clinical evidence specific cytokine pathway dysregulated . Monogenic defect IL-1 pathway cause cryopyrin associate periodic syndrome ( CAPS ) deficiency IL-1 receptor antagonist ( DIRA ) , latter caused mutation affect IL-1-receptor antagonist gene ( IL1RN ) . Both disorder respond complete resolution inflammatory response treatment short act IL-1 blocking agent anakinra . This exploratory study aim examine utility long act IL-1 inhibitor rilonacept ( rilonacept ; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals , Inc. ) This pilot study design address : 1 ) utility dosage rilonacept need achieve inflammatory remission child DIRA show response treatment anakinra [ Kineret [ register ] ] ; 2 ) evaluate safety pharmacokinetics young child rilonacept . Rilonacept recombinant fusion protein picomolar affinity IL-1 half-life approximately 7.5 day human . It approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treatment adult child 12 year age old Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes ( CAPS ) , test clinically mild form CAPS include Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome ( FCAS ) Muckle-Wells Syndrome ( MWS ) . In study , clinical , laboratory parameter initially measure baseline follow withdrawal anakinra 24 hour . Subjects receive course therapy rilonacept predict induce inflammatory remission . Clinical laboratory measure inflammation assess ; rilonacept dose escalation implement necessary achieve clinical laboratory remission . Subjects remain study 12 month primary end point evaluate 6 month . Those subject complete 1-year treatment period maintain improved clinical laboratory parameter compare baseline value , may continue receive study medication current dose . Principal investigator help obtain insurance coverage rilonacept continued treatment , discuss Regeneron Pharmaceuticals , Inc. additional supply rilonacept subject .</detailed_description>

If subject medication NSAIDs , methotrexate and/or oral steroid , requirement dos stable 2week period prior screen visit . 2 . Subjects great equal 3 month age ( however first 5 patient enrol 2 year age ) . Subjects 3 month old old enrol SMC data review first 5 enrolled patient . 3 . Participation NIH study # 03AR0173 ( Studies Natural History , Pathogenesis Outcome Autoinflammatory Diseases ( NOMID/CAPS , DIRA , CRMO , Still Disease , Behcet Disease , Undifferentiated Autoinflammatory Diseases ) 4 . Subjects currently treat anakinra may enrol study even though DIRA may quiescent . For subject , history active DIRA prior treatment anakinra sufficient . Subjects take anakinra 24 hour initiation drug treatment . Treatment naive patient also enrol SMC data review first 5 enrolled patient . 5 . Females childbearing potential ( young woman least one menstrual period regardless age ) must negative serum pregnancy test screen urine pregnancy test prior administration study medication . 6 .

Subjects latent TB ( positive PPD QuantiFERON TB Gold test ) currently treat adequate therapy least one month prior first dose study medication may include . Full prophylaxis regimen continue study . Subjects active TB past documentation adequate treatment may include strict clinical radiological followup per current guideline . The Infectious disease service consult regard patient evidence TB infection ( latent active , current history ) prior enrollment , appropriate study . Subjects BCGvaccinated also test . Interpretation PPD QuantiFERON TB Gold test BCG recipients subject receive BCG vaccine . Guardian/parent able understand , complete studyrelated questionnaire . Guardian/parent able willing give inform consent abide study procedure . EXCLUSION CRITERIA 1 . Treatment receive live virus vaccine ( measles , mumps , rubella vaccine ) 3 month prior baseline visit . No live vaccine allow throughout course study . 2 . Presence active infection history pulmonary TB infection without documented adequate therapy . Subjects current active TB , recent close exposure individual active TB , exclude study . Exceptions include patient latent TB treat adequate therapy least one month prior first dose study medication , patient history TB documentation adequate treatment . 3 . Positive test , prior history , HIV , Hepatitis B C. 4 . History malignancy . Subjects deem cured superficial malignancy cutaneous basal squamous cell carcinoma , situ cervical cancer may enrol . 5 . Known hypersensitivity Chinese Hamster Ovary cellderived biological component rilonacept . 6 . Presence additional rheumatic disease significant systemic disease . For example , major chronic infectious/ inflammatory/ immunologic disease ( inflammatory bowel disease , psoriatic arthritis , spondyloarthropathy , SLE addition autoinflammatory disease ) . 7 .
