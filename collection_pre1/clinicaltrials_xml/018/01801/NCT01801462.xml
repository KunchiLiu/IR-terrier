	<detailed_description>Background Ultrasonography become increasingly used many medical specialty last decade small less expensive ultrasound equipment become available . Although ultrasound image traditionally consider safe , use highly operator dependent ( EFSUMB 2010 ) . The lack sufficient operator skill lead diagnostic error eventually compromise patient safety due unnecessary test intervention ( Moore &amp; Copel 2011 ) . A recent report British National Health Service ( NHS ) analyze maternity claim report NHS past decade identify antenatal fetal ultrasound investigation one four major risk area obstetric care ( NHS 2012 ) . Traditional ultrasound training challenge long learn curve lack standardization competency-based training ( Salvesen et al . 2010 ) . Given long learn curve characterize traditional clinical training ( Jang et al . 2010 ) , proficiency term independence acceptable diagnostic accuracy may occur first many month train . Thus , resident may sufficiently train manage independent ultrasound examination expect safely . Accelerating learn curve therefore essential patient safety perspective patient discomfort intimate examination transvaginal ultrasound scan . However , may also important organizational viewpoint insufficiently trained resident may effective manage patient , trained proficiency . Simulation-based training become increasingly used several medical domain provide safe environment practice . Virtual Reality ( VR ) simulation previously show improve technical performance shorten operation time laparoscopic surgery ( Larsen et al . 2009 ) type training may therefore useful adjunct supervise clinical ultrasound practice . In previous study effect VR simulation , control group assign 'traditional training ' , often mean 'no train ' . Consequently , know VR simulation - include ultrasound simulation - superior optimal clinical training use real patient . Furthermore , study explore effect ultrasound simulation patient relate outcomes diagnostic accuracy , patient discomfort perception safety ultrasound examination . The effect organizational level use time per ultrasound examination , need re-examination senior clinician need ambulatory control due diagnostic uncertainty also unknown . Hence , aim explore follow research question : 1 ) What effect simulation-based training compare traditional training group OB/GYN resident without prior ultrasound experience , follow outcome : 1 . Patients ' discomfort level perception safety immediately transvaginal ultrasound examination gynecological care unit . 2 . Need re-examination patient clinical supervisor initial examination . 3 . Number ambulatory control need due diagnostic uncertainty . Methods Study setup In randomized observer-blinded study , effect simulation-based ultrasound training compare traditional training examine April 1st 2013 January 31st 2014 . Flowchart study design show Figure 3 . Ethical approval obtain Regional Ethical Committee Capital Region . The study conduct accordance Helsinki Declaration accordance CONSORT statement ( www.consort-statement.org ) . Participants All OB/GYN department eastern Denmark ( Zealand ) contact e-mail invited participate study ( N=7 ) . Inclusion criterion require participant 1 ) medical graduate 2 ) provide write informed consent . Exclusion criteria 1 ) formal ultrasound train 2 ) previous independent use ultrasound . The estimated number eligible resident seven department eight 12 month study , give total 56 potential participant , provide participation rate 100 % . All participant survey regard age , year post-graduate clinical practice , gender , handedness , experience video-gaming . Randomization The Clinical Trials Unit , Rigshospitalet , independently perform simple randomization participant computer either intervention group ( simulation training ) control group ( clinical training ) . The allocation participant conceal primary investigator data load database statistical processing . Intervention Simulation programme . Participants intervention group receive simulation training use two type ultrasound simulator ( see Figure 4 flowchart simulation programme ) . A short theoretical introduction pelvic ultrasound present simulation training begin . Theoretical read material concern early pregnancy complication provide participant prior simulation training . A final theoretical test provide ass knowledge equipment , ultrasound safety , anatomical landmark basic pathology . Content simulation training . A low-fidelity simulator ( BluePhantom ) , allow participant introduce probe familiarize ultrasound equipment , use initial training . Participants train 30 minute simulator move high-fidelity Virtual-Reality ( VR ) simulator ( Scantrainer , Medaphor ) . The VR simulator provide image obtain real patient haptic feedback ultrasound probe . The basic gynecologic advance gynecologic module select training purpose . The selection module base previous pilot study , 10 OB/GYN resident rat usefulness module VR simulator . Only modules rat four five five usefulness include training programme . When module pass VR simulator , participant receive 30 minute train low-fidelity simulator ( BluePhantom ) allow participant review function , train , use real ultrasound equipment . Instructor-feedback simulation . The participant receive 30 minute introduction VR simulator allow another two time 10 minute instructor-feedback time choice ( Ã˜stergaard et al . 2012 ) . Control Participants randomize control group receive traditional clinical introduction locally department . This may include observation supervised practice different type clinical training provide department gather department 's head education register . Follow-up outcome All participant follow six month . Patients eligible participation pelvic ultrasound examination perform , able understand read Danish , willing provide inform consent . Consenting patient survey pelvic ultrasound examination regard discomfort level perception safety ultrasound examination . Both question answer use 10-point Likert scale . The need re-examination supervise clinician , need ambulatory control include reason ( e.g . diagnostic uncertainty , routine control accord department national guideline etc . ) register nurse call . Sample size calculation A meaningful reduction need second re-examination senior clinician could 33 % assume standard deviation eight scan . Thus , total sample size 46 participant need use two-sided alpha 0.05 power 0.90 .</detailed_description>
