	<brief_summary>Ventriculoperitoneal shunt standard care patient communicate hydrocephalus , high failure rate - 40 % fail within 1 year 50 % fail within 2 year . It long assume endoscopic third ventriculostomy ( ETV ) would work population well suit patient obstructive hydrocephalus ( tumor block cerebral-spinal fluid ( CSF ) pathways ) . However , scientist learn CSF way brain absorb fluid , learn may straight-forward . Recent small study show ETVs work good percentage child communicate hydrocephalus , . But randomize control trial do compare two treatment directly determine provide child good prognosis , few surgery lifetime , less time hospital great chance normal life possible . The investigator conduct trial compare two surgical treatment patient randomize receive either shunt ETV . Because ETV show high failure rate newborn , investigator include patient instead study patient come Duke University communicate hydrocephalus age 1 year 18 year . The study include patient ventricular shunt need revision patient diagnose need first shunt . All patient agree participate randomize receive either ETV shunt . The study team follow one year time surgery determine percentage patient require CSF-related surgery , long go surgery need another surgery , much time spend hospital percentage patient suffer CSF-infections problem related surgery hydrocephalus . The study team examine result determine ETV safer effective treatment child communicate hydrocephalus ventricular shunt .</brief_summary>
