	<brief_summary>Bronchiectasis clinically characterize irreversible dilation bronchus bronchiole lead persistent cough , purulent sputum , airway ﬂow limitation , may accompany recurrent exacerbations.It increasingly recognize respiratory virus mainly responsible acute exacerbation chronic pulmonary disease , i.e . asthma , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease cystic fibrosis . However , little known role viral infection drive exacerbation bronchiectasis.This study aim identify frequency common viral infection determine role virus play acute exacerbation bronchiectasis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Bronchiectasis chronic airway disease characterise vicious cycle persistent bacterial colonization , inflammation progressive tissue destruction.Patients bronchiectasis frequently develop acute exacerbation characterise acute worsen require change concomitant use medication , attendant adverse effect morbidity health-related quality life . The detailed pathogenesis exacerbation bronchiectasis , however , remain poorly understood . Recent data suggest airway infection inflammation important driver exacerbation , therefore imbalance chronic bacterial infection host immune response may result bronchiectasis exacerbation . Viral infection may important factor lead events.It establish respiratory virus mainly responsible exacerbation chronic respiratory disease , i.e . asthma , COPD cystic fibosis . However , data regard prospective study seek investigate role virus acute exacerbation bronchiectasis lacking . Furthermore , association virus bacteria exacerbation need assess . This study target indentifying frenquency common viral infection adult non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis may shed light effect clinical parameter , i.e . length exacerbate symptom recovery , lung function , pulmonary inflammation , bacterial load quality life .</detailed_description>
