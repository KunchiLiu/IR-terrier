	<brief_title>Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Patients With Intermittent Claudication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In patient peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) , exercise induce limb ischemia ( claudication ) limit walk capacity . Symptoms due pain hip and/or buttock . Couple origins may induce pain vascular , cardiac , respiratory , musculoskeletal , neurologic , hematologic etc . The rate associate respiratory pathology patient low extremity artery disease ( LEAD ) around 15 % . The intolerance walk could link exercise hypoxia appear low limb pain without associate dyspnea . The exercise hypoxemia become diagnostic intermittent vascular claudication . Tests perform diagnose intermittent claudication Ankle Brachial Systolic pressure Index ( ABI ) , echo-Doppler low limb artery walk test treadmill associate measurement distal chest transcutaneous oxygen pressure ( tcpO2 ) . Thus , purpose present research determine prevalence obstructive sleep apnoea patient PAD .</detailed_description>
