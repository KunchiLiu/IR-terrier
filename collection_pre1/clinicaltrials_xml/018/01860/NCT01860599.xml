	<brief_summary>It well know diabetes excessive high blood sugar cause blood vessel blood cell damage . It also possible , , people pre-diabetes may also start blood vessel blood cell damage blood sugar rise normal range diabetic range . In addition look potential damage , question whether damage improves exercise . This study aim look blood vessel blood cell three different way 1 ) look blood vessel respond `` sheer force '' ( blood pressure cuff pump release minute ) . This do ultrasound . 2 ) By look blood test blood sugar , cholesterol , inflammation 3 ) By look certain blood cell lab , long live number cell leave certain number day , , improve exercise .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- To refine non-invasive test endothelial dysfunction . The investigator examine flow response sheer-stress induced relief pressure exert blood pressure cuff brachial artery , measure flow response Doppler . This measure local nitric oxide production endothelial cell know impaired diabetic , normal non-diabetics , unknown prediabetics . - To measure individual indicator glucose metabolism abnormality include fast blood glucose , HbA1C , insulin sensitivity homeostasis model assessment-estimated insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) insulin level . - To measure Endothelial Progenitor Cell ( EPC ) count , viability , gene expression key gene endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) , von-Willebrand 's Factor ( vWF ) adhesion molecules platelet-endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 ( PECAM-1 CD31 ) , cadherin Vascular-Endothelial cadherin ( VE-cadherin ) CD ( cell surface marker ) -144 , growth factor vascular-endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) Insulin like growth factor ( IGF-1 ) EPCs pre-diabetes subject pre post exercise . - Correlate glucose metabolism abnormalities potential causative factor endothelial dysfunction study EPC function migration tube formation susceptibility apoptosis moderate hyperglycemia . Apoptosis assay do Flow Cytometry analysis use Annexin V- Propidium-iodide dye . - Subjects randomize intervention ( structured exercise ) continuation usual life style ( non-exercise , sedentary ) group . In arm study , subject encourage adhere standard dietary advice pre-diabetic patient receive part standard care , irrespective design arm . The investigator expect exercise improve flow-mediated vasodilatation , EPC colony count function , along good key gene expression note Real Time-qualitative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . - Assess effect intervention compare finding individual , paired manner . - After washout period , individual cross see whether effect intervention reverse demonstrate difference control intervention subject due aerobic exercise intervention , due random difference</detailed_description>
