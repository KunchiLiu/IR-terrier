	<brief_summary>This study extension European Multicentre Tics In Children Studies ( EMTICS ) COURSE study separate study protocol exist ; Aim clinical trial study efficacy treatment antibiotic reduce severity tic associate neuropsychiatric symptom patient tic disorder colonise GAS . Primary Objective : Test hypothesis antibiotic treatment GAS colonisation compare placebo associate large reduction tic associate neuropsychiatric symptom short-term ( 1 month ) patient tic disorder colonise GAS . Secondary Objective : Test hypothesis antibiotic treatment GAS colonisation superior placebo long-term ( 1 year ) reduction tic associate neuropsychiatric symptom patient tic disorder colonize GAS . Patients affect chronic tic disorder follow EMTICS- Longitudinal Course Study show positive culture GAS microbiological examination follow-up consider eligible treatment trial . Patients show GAS positivity invite participate clinical trial . The patient enrol randomly assign antibiotic placebo 1:1 ratio . All participate patient undergo microbiological , serological clinical assessment 1 month date enter treatment trial ( i.e . around 20 day end treatment ) . Then , patient follow clinical , laboratory microbiological assessment every four month 1 year . Patients deblinded end treatment trial follow-up ( 1 year recruitment ) . Patients develop true GAS infection otherwise need prescribe antibiotic clinical reason follow-up withdrawn study immediately deblinded . Data patient would , however , remain part study analysis , follow intention-to-treat principle .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Amoxicilline/Clavulanic Acid Patients Affected Tic Disorder Colonized Group A Streptococcus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following study perform topic , child affect tic disorder show rate Group A Streptococcus ( GAS ) colonization similar slightly high report normal population . However , several study document high rate elevate anti-streptolysin O titer ( ASOT ) child affect tic disorder . One study report significantly high ASOT 150 child tic compare 150 healthy child , document direct relationship ASOT tic severity . In study , however , throat swab culture analyse subsample patient fail detect predominant GAS serotype associate tic . An American cohort 81 patient TS also exhibit high ASOT age-matched healthy volunteer mixed group patient autoimmune disease . Increased ASOT , anti-deoxyribonuclease B ( DNAse B ) , anti- streptococcal M12 M19 titres also observe small German sample patient TS . In British cohort 100 patient TS ( 50 % child ) , ASOT raise 64 % child 68 % adult TS ; significantly high neurological disease healthy control subject . Two report British Italian cohort confirm finding . However , subsequent study fail find significant association ASOT anti-DNAse B titres use cross-sectional approach . More recently , study large service-based cohort TS patient confirm significant elevate rate high ASOT , evidence also , prospective analysis , ASOT persistently elevate 57 % patient TS . Moreover , tic patient enhance immune response limit ASOT involve broad range GAS antigens . Taken together , observation lead hypothesize TS patient colonize GAS merely carriers colonization may promote sustain anti-streptococcal immune response contribute persistence tic symptom . If hypothesis true , antibiotic treatment GAS colonization patient affect chronic tic disorder could modify symptoms term severity number exacerbation . Up , tic patient diagnose Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated Streptococcal infection ( PANDAS ) underwent control antibiotic treatment : two trial , aim study efficacy different preventive regimen number tic exacerbation , obtain however mixed result , mainly due poor compliance . Investigators design placebo-controlled trial amoxicilline/clavulanic acid tic patient show GAS colonization . This drug first line therapy streptococcal pharyngo-tonsillitis . Some previous study show superiority amoxicillin versus penicillin treatment GAS infection . A 10-day course amoxicillin consider sufficient efficient treatment GAS tonsillo-pharyngitis . Moreover , oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid oral clindamycin 10 day achieve comparable rate bacteriologic eradication 12 day 3 month . Furthermore , amoxicilline/clavulanic acid demonstrate efficacious treatment GAS colonization . A antibiotic regimen - evaluate prospectively randomize , control trials- demonstrate efficacy termination GAS carriage : among , regimen 10 day amoxicillin/ clavulanic acid effective repeat penicillin patient treatment failure . Thus , 10-days regimen amoxicilline/clavulanic acid efficient GAS eradication , hand , shortness treatment avert problem patient 's compliance .</detailed_description>
