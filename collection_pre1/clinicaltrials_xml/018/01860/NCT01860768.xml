	<brief_summary>Acute aortic dissection ( AAD ) acute vascular lesion high early misdiagnosis rate ( 31.8 % ) , mortality rate 38 % . In recent year , incidence rise serious threat human health . At present , clinical diagnosis AAD commonly use image method , include chest X-ray , B ultrasound , CT , MRI aortic angiography . Chest X-ray two-dimensional ultrasound limit diagnosis AAD , esophageal ultrasonography display intimal , identify true false lumen , great risk . CT , MRI aortic angiography use diagnosis method , time-consuming , expensive require handle patient emergency situation , use prefer . Therefore , significance biomarkers high specificity sensitivity clinical fast diagnosis AAD . Parts small sample test find single serum α-smooth muscle actin ( α-SMA ) , myosin heavy chain ( MHC ) human soluble elastin fragment ( sELAF ) level patient AAD significantly high others ( normal people , acute myocardial infarction patient ) . But small study sample , limit control risk factor incomplete comparison , conclusion questionable . In previous study also find serum α-SMA , MHC sELAF level pathogenesis AAD prognosis closely relate . Therefore , basis , prospective study need . We observe three biomarkers enrol patient acute chest pain emergency department , level healthy volunteer blank control . Then make definite diagnosis enrol patient , observe biomarkers dynamic change AAD . Lastly , evaluate early diagnostic value combination serum α-SMA , MHC sELAF level patient AAD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective clinical study design procure blood sample patient present Emergency Department suspect AAD . Subjects enrol study sign inform consent 3 blood sample draw different time point emergency department visit . In addition , data collect patient 's health history , hospital procedure , final diagnosis . Blood sample collect study send laboratory long-term storage analysis future blood marker become available . No genetic testing conduct sample .</detailed_description>
