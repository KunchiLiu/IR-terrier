	<brief_summary>This study randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blinded , therapeutic exploratory clinical trial branch chain amino acid ( BCAA 's ) treatment sports-related concussion . The aim study determine whether , compare placebo treatment , administration BCAA 's , one dos , sports-related concussion improve neurocognitive recovery one time-periods post concussion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BCAA 's Sports-related Concussion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Centers Disease Control estimate 1.6 - 3.8 million sport related concussion occur year United States . A large proportion athlete endure cognitive neurobehavioral problem . Concussion heterogeneous insult brain precipitate complex pathophysiological process result cascade deleterious side effect . At present , proven therapy mitigate prevent neurocognitive neurobehavioral consequence sports-related concussion . The limbic hippocampus , brain structure crucial learn memory , often damage concussion . In preclinical study , analysis hippocampus isolate mice traumatic brain injury demonstrate concentration three branch chain amino acid ( valine , isoleucine , leucine ) significantly alter ( reduce ) injury . When brain-injured animal receive dietary supplementation branch chain amino acid ( BCAA 's ) , concentration amino acid restore injured hippocampus injured animal demonstrate significant cognitive improvement level comparable obtain non-injured control animal . In light result increase awareness morbidity associate concussion , conduct therapeutic exploratory clinical trial determine effect BCAA 's reduce neurocognitive side effect sports-related concussion injury .</detailed_description>
