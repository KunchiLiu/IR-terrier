	<brief_title>Effect Intermittent Hemodialysis Sleep Apnea Syndrome End Stage Renal Disease Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep disorder breathe prevalent end stage kidney disease patient general population , may participate increase cardiovascular mortality observe group patient . Despite significant increase knowledge harmful effect obstructive sleep apnea , pathophysiological mechanism poorly understood . Recent observation suggest causative relationship overnight fluid displacement legs neck soft severity obstructive sleep apnea . This mechanism demonstrate otherwise healthy subject , heart failure patient , patient venous insufficiency . We thus suspect pathophysiologic mechanism could explain increased prevalence obstructive sleep apnea patient hypervolemia , include chronic renal failure . The purpose trial investigate hypothesis nocturnal rostral fluid ship link overhydration participate significantly severity obstructive sleep apnea patient hemodialysis . The correction overhydration hemodialysis therefore reduce amount nocturnally displaced water consequently low severity obstructive sleep apnea . The severity obstructive sleep apnea measure two consecutive attend polysomnographies , perform ambulatory hemodialysis session fluid removal , whereas overhydration leg fluid evaluate bioimpedance , perform begin end polysomnography . The sequence two polysomnographies respect hemodialysis randomize , minimize first-night effect .</detailed_description>
