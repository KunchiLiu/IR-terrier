	<brief_summary>This pilot study test feasibility acceptability 12 week combine aerobic strength training intervention among person HIV age 50 old exercise frequently , preliminary effect aging-related outcome . The study use randomize , control trial design intend lead large clinical trial long-term follow-up . The intervention incorporate small group instruction trainer , small wearable accelerometer provide accurate data physical activity , real-time feedback participant exercise level . The primary outcome measure change fitness , measure change maximal oxygen consumption ( VO2 max ) . The control group receive comparable exercise intervention complete 12 week observation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Effects Exercise Aging Among Older Persons With HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 40 individual HIV infection least 6 month duration currently exercise infrequently randomize 2:1 ratio either Intervention Arm ( immediate exercise intervention program 12 week duration ) , Control Arm ( observation 12 week duration follow treatment onset observation complete ) . Persons assign Intervention Arm meet initially per week personal trainer , per week small group personal trainer , total two weekly session assist strength training . In addition , participant encourage engage three session aerobic exercise per week gradually increase intensity 40 minute duration , 12 week intervention period . Instruction walk run form body awareness may reduce risk injury ( ChiWalking ChiRunning technique ) provide Intervention Arm certify coach three session course 12 week intervention period part aerobic exercise plan . Paid gym membership provide 12 week treatment period group ( membership participant assign Control Arm begin end 12 week observation period ) . Data collect strength training activity use passive FitLinxx system study gym , aerobic step pace use accelerometer ( Pebble FitLinxx ) . Participants group ask wear accelerometer duration study period . Participants evaluate baseline , week 6 week 12 change lab value questionnaire item . Change fitness assess use V02 max baseline week 12 .</detailed_description>
