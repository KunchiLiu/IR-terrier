	<brief_summary>- When Primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PPCI ) perform expeditiously high-volume centre , optimal approach ST elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) . In contrast clarity treat STEMI , clear definition discharge patient discharge . - An early discharge strategy may desire party ( financial health care provider , treat physician , nurse , patient , patient 's relative ) involve STEMI . - The main goal study test hypothesis early discharge strategy within 48-56 hour patient successful PPCI safe patient stay longer ( 96-120 hour ) standard procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PPCI ) become optimal reperfusion strategy ST elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) procedure perform expeditiously high-volume centre.In contrast clarity treat STEMI , clear definition discharge patient discharge . - It conceivable discharge patient successful PPCI early possible , hospital stay longer need may create undesirable outcome term hospital infection , psychosocial reason , adequate mobilization patient comfort . In many tertiary centre busy PPCI programme insufficient bed capacity ongoing concern threaten continuous acceptance new case acute infarction . In addition , indicate early discharge policy may lead substantial cost saving . - Although much work do develop validate risk score identify low risk patient , data implementation early discharge strategy quite limit There 3 randomise trial investigate possibility early discharge PPCI . However , certain limitation study prevent implement early discharge strategy all-comers , particularly underrepresentation old patient clinical trial . The verification policy also need patient multivessel disease . The first prospective randomize trial , PAMI II,7 partly obsolete major change make PPCI respect device adjunctive medication . The two randomized trial single-center pilot study small number patient . - Therefore , mention literature information warrant test reproducibility safety endpoint large scale multicenter trial , prior application early discharge strategy clinical practice .</detailed_description>
