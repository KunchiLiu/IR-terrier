	<brief_summary>Huntington 's Disease ( HD ) autosomal dominant disease manifest triad cognitive , psychiatric , motor sign symptom . HD cause triplet repeat ( CAG ) expansion gene Huntingtin ( HTT ) . This disease classically conceptualize neurodegenerative disease . However , recent evidence suggest abnormal brain development may play important role etiology HD . Huntingtin ( HTT ) express development life . In animal study , HTT gene show vital brain development . This suggest mutant form HTT ( gene-expanded CAG repeat 40 ) would affect normal brain development . In addition , study adults gene-expanded HD , yet manifest illness , ( pre-HD subject ) significant change structure brain , even 20 year onset clinical diagnosis . How far back change evident unknown . One possibility brain change present throughout life , due change brain development , though initially associate subtle functional abnormality . In effort well understand developmental aspect brain disease , current study proposes evaluate brain structure function child , adolescent , young adult ( age 6-18 ) risk develop HD - parent grandparent HD . Brain structure evaluate use Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) quantitative measure entire brain , cerebral cortex , well white matter integrity via Diffusion Tensor Imaging . Brain function assess cognitive test , physical neurologic evaluation , behavioral assessment , quantitative craniofacial structure assessment . Subjects gene-expanded ( GE ) compare subject gene non-expanded ( GNE ) well match healthy control . Changes brain structure and/or function GE group , compare GNE control group , would lend support notion disease important developmental component .</brief_summary>
