	<detailed_description>The incidence PH 1.3 per 1,000 live birth . Formerly , risk factor associate PH include severity associate illness , intrauterine growth restriction , patent ductus arteriosus ( PDA ) , coagulopathy , need assist ventilation . Currently , PH occur mainly preterm ventilate infant severe respiratory distress syndrome ( RDS ) often PDA receive surfactant . Currently , PH complicate hospital course 3-5 % preterm infant RDS . The cause PH think due rapid lower intrapulmonary pressure , facilitate leave right shunt across patent ductus arteriosus increase pulmonary blood flow . Prospective uncontrolled study use surfactant PH neonate show promising result treat PH.In study aim evaluate effect two different natural surfactant neonates pulmonary hemorrhage .</detailed_description>
