	<brief_summary>The purpose research learn heart blood vessel lungs people cystic fibrosis ( CF ) . This study include approximately 36 child adult CF 12 child adult without CF . The study involve one magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . The research also include blood sample look inflammation lung test call spirometry Lung Clearance Index ( LCI ) determine Multiple Breath Washout test . For CF subject , enrollment time coincide routine schedule computerized tomography ( CT ) CF subject may choose CT research purpose . The MRI compare CT image lung . The goal develop well image use radiation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) , common inherit disease Caucasians , characterize chronic pulmonary inflammation progressive loss gas exchange unit eventually result respiratory failure . There strong evidence CF abnormally low vascular perfusion carry high risk death independent presence pulmonary hypertension . However , evolution pulmonary vascular disease CF might contribute rate decline lung function know . Knowledge remain limited result old observational study conclude major cause pulmonary vascular remodel hypertension CF hypoxic respiratory failure destruction lung tissue . Recent data obtain state-of-the-art Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) pulmonary circulation , challenge exist paradigm . Studies demonstrate absence hypoxia , significant change pulmonary perfusion surrogate measure vascular resistance well collateral blood flow begin early course CF . The newly develop therapeutic last decade alter dramatically course patient suffer pulmonary vascular disease provide opportunity understand role pulmonary vasculature CF lung disease . This pilot study ( Pilot 3 ) ass relationship pulmonary perfusion , serum marker pulmonary inflammation vascular remodeling , hemodynamic measure consistent pulmonary hypertension . This study establish MRI readily obtainable modality use CF population obtain measurement pulmonary perfusion ; pulmonary arterial hemodynamic , dimension , flow measure ; ventricular mass function measure . The primary goal study improve understand pulmonary vascular disease CF examine pulmonary perfusion abnormality association marker pulmonary inflammation pulmonary vascular remodeling , severity obstructive airway disease , pulmonary hemodynamic abnormality CF . This study include single MRI pulmonary circulation 36 pediatric adult patient CF 12 non-CF control . UTE ( Ultrashort Echo Time ) MRI perform without contrast . CF patient schedule clinical chest CT enrol schedule MRI coordinate clinical CT. CF subject may also choose enroll independent clinical CT choose CT research purpose . Other study procedure include blood specimen serum biomarkers lung test call spirometry Lung Clearance Index ( LCI ) determine Multiple Breath Washout test . Blood specimens analyzed panel inflammatory marker .</detailed_description>
