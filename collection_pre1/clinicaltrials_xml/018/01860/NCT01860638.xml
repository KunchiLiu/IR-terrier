	<brief_summary>This multicenter , double-blind , placebo-controlled , randomize study evaluate efficacy safety addition bevacizumab placebo treatment lomustine second-line treatment standard care ( SOC ) third-line treatment follow disease progression first-line treatment participant newly diagnose glioblastoma . All enrol participant receive first-line treatment radiotherapy , temozolomide bevacizumab ( 10 milligram per kilogram per week [ mg/kg/week ] intravenously [ IV ] every 2 week ) . At first disease progression ( PD1 ) , eligible participant randomize receive lomustine plus either bevacizumab ( 10 mg/kg/week IV every 2 week ) placebo 2nd-line treatment . After disease progression ( PD2 ) , participant receive standard care agent continue bevacizumab placebo 3rd-line treatment .</brief_summary>
