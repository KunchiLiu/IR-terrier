	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesize E-health - web base monitoring disease treatment - young patient chronic inflammatory disease ( IBD ) improve disease course quality life . Adherence ( take prescribe medicine ) difficult young patient . In E-health project investigator seek improve young patient ( 10-17 year ) responsibility treatment , empower thereby enhance adherence order achieve quiet disease course . Through e-Health program web-app disease activity present young patient via simple traffic light chart patient guide : continue prescribed medication , call physician visit out-patient clinic . In future concept believe also applicable young patient chronic disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Web-based Monitoring Children Adolescents With Inflammatory Bowel Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IBD 's natural history characterize relapse ( e.g . rectal bleeding , diarrhoea , abdominal pain , faecal urgency , fistula anal abscess ) remission . In child adolescent disease aggressive course compare adult , cause deterioration quality life . During puberty patient especially vulnerable period live high risk develop social disability due disease . Furthermore , IBD lead many day absence school patient risk able maintain education . Patients treat medically disease active , also quiet phase order maintain remission . It therefore crucial success patient receive insight disease understand importance follow recommended maintenance treatment . Despite aware increase risk acute hospitalization surgery , difficult adult pediatric patient follow continuous medication ( adherence ) . It know 50 % young patient fail take medication direct . Previous study use E-health treatment IBD patient . In M. Elkjaer et al . 2010 study 300 patient mild-to-moderate UC , E-health treatment result short period active disease ( average 18 vs. 77 day control group ) , 88 % satisfied treatment use E-health need outpatient visit reduce . In another study , Pedersen et al . 2012 , 27 patient CD examine biological treatment , E-Health able optimize time infliximab treatment CD patient . The E-Health solution safe use patient show high adherence program ( 86 % ) . To investigator knowledge study previously use E-health treatment child adolescent IBD . It , however , investigator belief treatment concept would readily take patient , web communication , least Denmark , already well-integrated part daily live . The current study consist two project : Project A : Patients treatment medicine administrate home . Project B : Patients treatment biological infusion Project A : Patients treatment medicine administrate home monitored , accord current international guideline , outpatient visit every third month . Patients participate current project randomly split two group follow two year . E-health group : Web-monitoring annual visit IBD center . Control group : Routine outpatient control , four time year . Project B : According current guideline , patient receive treatment biologicals visit outpatient clinic approximately every eighth week treatment give intravenously . During E-health intervention , symptoms fecal calprotectin monitor closely web-program , treatment initiate symptom elevate FC . In way timing treatment biologicals optimize infusion delay maximum treatment-free period 12 week , earlier 8 week necessary .</detailed_description>
