	<detailed_description>Metabolic acidosis frequent occurrence follow major surgery . Monitoring acid base disturbance particular diagnose aetiology acidosis important part assess patient 's cardiovascular status follow surgery . The presence metabolic acidosis frequently attribute anaerobic metabolism lead generation lactic acid due hypovolaemia poor tissue perfusion . This commonly result clinician treat postoperative patient metabolic acidosis administer intravenous fluid contain 0.9 % saline Hartmann 's solution ( compound sodium lactate ) . If cause metabolic acidosis hypovolaemia , treatment intravenous fluid may actually exacerbate acidosis cause hyperchloraemia . An often overlook cause metabolic acidosis surgery starvation lead ketoacidosis . All patient starve minimum six hour prior general anaesthesia due potential risk aspiration gastric content bronchial tree . Many patient fact fast much long period . There , however , little data describe incidence ketoacidosis follow surgery . In addition , may cause acidosis surgery often overlook determine use equation mathematical model . The aim study define incidence nature acidosis major cancer surgery use use equation directly determine acid . This study also aim compare ability commonly use indirect measure ( base deficit , anion gap , correct anion gap lactate ) identify presence tissue acid population . The incidence postoperative ketoacidosis contributor tissue acidosis assess use point care urinalysis .</detailed_description>
