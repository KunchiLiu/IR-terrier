If two unvaccinated caregiver accompany infant choose enroll study , may receive discordant Tdap voucher amount ; however , receive baby care product voucher / gift card . Randomization arm occur block randomization study number take place prior recruitment . The research assistants show video therefore blind educational arm . However , research assistant enroll participant blind voucher arm envelope seal .

Voucher redemption voluntary ; data regard vaccination redemption collect Rite Aid pharmacy . Participants choose redeem Tdap vaccine voucher , convenience , 2 local Rite Aid pharmacy . At pharmacy , caregiver must complete screen form receive Tdap . Vouchers serialize barcode swipe time redemption Baby care item voucher like coupon redeem cashier pharmacy . Project staff perform phone follow-up interview participant one month enrol study ascertain vaccination status solicit feedback intervention barrier vaccination . Baseline characteristic summarize standard descriptive summary ( e.g . mean standard deviation continuous variable percentages categorical variable ) . All voucher unique identification ( ID ) number . Variables age , gender , insurance status , relationship participant ( ) infant , vaccination status , date time voucher distribution summarize . The research coordinator also record many caregiver refuse participate approached enrollment . The proportion caregiver screen meet enrollment criterion proportion meeting enrollment criterion consent participate calculate . We measure proportion participant enrol redeem study Tdap voucher . In addition , assess feasibility voucher distribution , completeness redemption data record pharmacy , ability ass caregiver vaccination status .
