	<brief_summary>Background : There evidence high cardiovascular risk rheumatic inflammatory disease . Recent evidence suggest psoriatic arthritis also associate increase cardiovascular risk accelerate atherosclerosis increase cardiovascular risk . However , data regard cardiovascular comorbidity cardiovascular risk factor patient psoriatic arthritis limit . Objective : The aim study investigate effect daily supplementation 3 g n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid risk marker cardiovascular disease inflammation patient psoriatic arthritis . Design : Randomized double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter trial n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid patient psoriatic arthritis . Setting : Departments Rheumatology , Nephrology Cardiology Aalborg University Hospital Vendsyssel Hospital Region Northern Denmark Participants : 156 men woman age &gt; 18 year psoriatic arthritis classify CASPAR criterion include . Exclusion criterion : cardiac arrhythmia , conduction disturbance , treatment biological drug oral corticosteroid . Inclusion time : spring 2013 spring 2015 . Method : The follow data collect participant : Interview include dietary record , assessment tender swollen joint , enthesitis , dactylitis , patient global assessment disease activity ( Visual Analogue Scale ) , global assessment pain ( Visual Analogue Scale ) , psoriatic skin involvement Psoriatic Area Severity Index ( PASI ) , laboratory parameter disease activity risk marker cardiovascular disease . For detection early cardiovascular risk marker Heart Rate Variability ( HRV ) Pulse Wave Velocity ( PWV ) perform . Main outcome measure : The primary endpoint HRV secondary endpoint PWV , inflammatory activity use analgesic . The trial approve The local Ethics Committee , registration number N20120076</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Method Study design : The study design randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter trial . The patient randomly assign block five computer-generated block sequence . For 24 week patient assign daily intake 6 capsule contain either 3 g n-3 PUFA ( 50 % EPA 50 % DHA ) fish oil capsule 3 g olive oil ( approximately 80 % oleic acid 20 % linoleic acid ) . All investigator , patient research staff blind supplementation code . Patients ask maintain usual diet whole study . The study conduct accordance Declaration Helsinki Good clinical practice ( GCP ) . Subjects : Patients PsA define Classification criterion psoriatic arthritis ( CASPAR ) ( 25 ) enrol Departments Rheumatology , Aalborg University Hospital Department Rheumatology , Vendsyssel Hospital , Denmark . The inclusion criterion PsA adult 18 year age disease activity exclusion criterion document cardiac arrhythmia , treatment biological drug treatment oral corticosteroid . Compliance assess counting capsule last visit . Patients define non-compliant &gt; 150 capsule return include per-protocol analysis . All participant give write informed consent regional ethic committee Northern Region Denmark , approve study . Clinical assessment : Patients assessed baseline , 12 week supplement 24 week . At baseline , duration disease , medical history , smoke habit diet obtain Medical history diabetes mellitus , hypertension dyslipidemia assess defined present patient receive dietary medical therapy condition . A food questionnaire use assess patient ' fish consumption lunch dinner . A score fish intake give accord follow : never eat fish = 1 ; eat fish month =2 ; eat fish two three time month = 3 ; eat fish week = 4 ; eat fish two three time week = 5 ; eat fish least daily = 6 . At visit conventional cardiovascular risk factor smoke habit , blood pressure , body mass index ( BMI ) waist hip ratio ( WHR ) assess patient . Additionally , clinical evaluation perform , consist 68 tender joint count , 66 swollen joint count , disease activity score ( DAS ) psoriatic skin area involvement ( PASI ) . Blood sample : Blood sample take non-fasting morning assessment fatty acid composition granulocyte routine laboratory evaluation . Granulocytes isolate whole blood , lipid extract fatty acid esterify previously report ( 26 ) . The fatty acid composition granulocyte determine gas chromatography Chrompack CP-9002 gas chromatograph ( Varian , Middelberg , The Netherlands ) express weight percent ( wt . % ) total fatty acid . HRV : Five min HRV recording obtain SphygmoCor Technology ( SphygmoCor , Software version 8.2 ; AtCor Medical , Sydney , NSW , Australia ) . HRV record patient accord current recommendation ( 27 ) . The measurement obtain morning hour rest 15 min room constant temperature 20°C . Patients instruct smoke avoid alcohol caffeine-containing beverage within 12 h prior investigation . A trained technician blind type supplement perform analysis . The patient place supine position ( rest ) 10 min , breathe spontaneously without talk . HRV analyse time-domain follow variable use : - RR : mean normal RR interval 5 min record - SDNN : standard deviation normal RR interval 5 min record - SDNNindex : mean standard deviation normal RR interval . - pNN50 : percentage successive RR-interval difference &gt; 50 m - RMSSD : square root mean sum square difference adjacent interval PWV : PWV pulse wave analysis perform non-invasively Sphygmocor system ( AtCor Medical , Sydney , NSW , Australia ) , describe previously ( 28 ) accord international recommendation ( 29 ) . All measurement make duplicate single train operator mean two value use analysis . Carotid-radial carotid-femoral PVW measure use arterial tonometry . All measurement perform right side extremity . The surface distance measure tape measure straight line suprasternal notch carotid location ( proximal pulse ) subtract distance suprasternal notch radial femoral location ( distal pulse ) ( 30,31 ) . The pressure wave transit time determined time R-wave ECG proximal pulse subtracted time R-wave ECG distal pulse . PWV subsequently calculate divide surface distance pressure wave transit time . The central BP estimate use SphygmoCor® device . After 10 min rest supine position , brachial BP measure three time 2-min interval leave arm automatic Microlife® device , last measurement take representative brachial artery BP . Hereafter , radial artery pressure waveform right arm sample . Using validated generalize transfer function , central BP estimate use brachial systolic diastolic BP ( 32,33 ) . Aortic augmentation index ( AIx ) standardize heart rate 75 beat per minute minimize effect heart rate . Only measurements T1 ( time initial upstroke pressure wave ) &gt; 80 &lt; 150 m augmentation index ( AI , difference first second peak arterial waveform percentage pulse pressure ) &lt; 50 % operator index ( arbitrary number 1 100 describe quality derive pulse wave ) &gt; 80 accepted accord recommendation ( AtCor Medical® website ) . Statistical Analysis All statistical analysis perform use STATA version13 ( StataCorp LP , TX , US ) We hypothesize intervention n-3 PUFA would increase HRV parameter RR 0.5 standard deviation ( SD ) . To achieve p &lt; 0.05 1-β = 0.80 need sample size 63 subject group . The difference continuous outcome baseline 24 week randomization compare two treatment group one-sided analysis variance ( ANOVA ) . Equality variances treatment group assess use Bartlett 's test . Due potential confounding random treatment assignment analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) perform . Prior analysis check collinearity covariates perform model modify accordingly . In model equality variance assess use Levene 's test . The total number parameter model restrict one tenth number study participant number category specify model . All analysis perform intention treat ( none patient exclude patient analyzed accord randomization scheme ) per-protocol ( patient complete entire clinical trial accord protocol ) analyse . The analysis control age , sex , smoke status , presence absence diabetes mellitus , hypertension hypercholesterolemia , use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) disease activity score . Differences consider significant p-value &lt; 0.05 ( two-tailed ) .</detailed_description>
