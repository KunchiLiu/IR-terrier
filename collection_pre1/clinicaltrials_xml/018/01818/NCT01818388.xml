Lack meaningful response verbal command upon arrival hospital suffer nontraumatic cardiac arrest outofhospital set 5 . Return spontaneous circulation ( ROSC ) within 30 minute EMS arrival 6 . Able maintain SBP &gt; 90mmHg 30 minute post ROSC without use pressor OR stable dose pressor ( escalation pressor require , patient eligible ) 7 . Undergoing Therapeutic Hypothermia use ZOLL 's IVTM System within twelve hour ROSC BUT initiate soon possible Exclusion Criteria 1 . Traumatic cardiac arrest [ due blunt trauma , penetrate injury ( e.g. , stab , gunshot , etc . ) , burn , exsanguinations , strangulation , smoke inhalation , electrocution , hang , drown , etc . ] 2 .
