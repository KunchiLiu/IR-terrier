	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers interested compare two method doctor use position catheter blood vessel . These method use deliver chemotherapy close blood supply tumor . The method standard method call fluoroscopy new way call 3-D Roadmap . The 3-D Roadmap software use compute tomography ( CT ) image help doctor choose best position catheter get tumor . The computer show route x-ray screen real time . This technique may help doctor position catheter less x-ray dye short time . These method compare people procedure destroy liver tumor . The procedure , call trans-arterial embolization , deliver chemotherapy destroy tumor blood supply . Objectives : - To compare effectiveness fluoroscopy 3-D Roadmap software liver tumor treatment . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age trans-arterial embolization liver cancer . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They provide blood urine sample , image study . - Participants divide two group . One group regular fluoroscopy ( X-ray ) procedure . The group procedure 3-D Roadmap software . - In first group , participant CT scan . The doctor decide many vessel need treat . The doctor advance catheter use fluoroscopy . Another CT scan give procedure . - In second group , participant CT scan . The doctor look scan 3-D Roadmap software . The software show path advance catheter . The doctor use software help destroy tumor . Another CT scan give procedure . - Both group follow-up care afterward . Other test give needed cancer treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : This phase II prospective randomize trial compare novel tumor segmentation navigation 3D roadmap vs. conventional image angiography trans-arterial embolization procedure . Cone beam CT ( CBCT ) obtain CT-like image angiography suite trans-arterial chemoembolization procedure liver chemo-perfusion ( PHP ) . In addition , 2D liver perfusion metric calculate angiography image . 3D Roadmap navigation tool/ software utilize data CBCT overlay live fluoroscopy display segment tumor , delineate vascular supply navigate catheter target vessel . Moreover , 3D Roadmap , CBCT fuse prior CT MRI improve target visualization . The 3D Roadmap software receive 510 ( k ) clearance February 19 , 2004 . Our CRADA partner , Philips Healthcare , also submit receive separate 510 ( k ) clearance January 30 , 2015 software vessel segmentation functionality trade name Emboguide . 3D Roadmap/ Emboguide software intend use combination AlluraClarity X-ray system . Primary Objective : To compare safety , technical efficiency navigation 3D Roadmap vs. conventional image guidance trans-arterial embolization procedure . Eligibility : Subjects eligible : - They 18 year age - They primary metastatic hepatic tumor schedule trans-arterial chemo- embolization bland embolization interventional radiology - They eligible trans-arterial chemoembolization bland embolization Subjects exclude : - An altered mental status preclude understand consent procedure - Contra-indications trans-arterial embolization - A gross body weight exceed 375 pound ( upper limit angio table ) - A pregnancy - A severe allergic reaction iodine contrast control premedication antihistamine steroid Design : - Number Participants : 30 - Recruitment Time Frame : 2 year - Number site : 1 - Type Study : prospective randomize clinical trial</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients must primary metastatic hepatic tumor schedule transarterial chemoembolization bland embolization interventional radiology . A multidisciplinary team include oncology , surgery , pathology radiation oncology well interventional radiology review candidate determine eligibility TACE bland embolization ineligibility intervention . 2 . Age &gt; 18 year 3 . They must eligible transarterial chemoembolization bland embolization EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Patients alter mental status preclude understand consent procedure 2 . History allergic reaction iodine contrast , control premedication antihistamine steroid . 3 . Pregnant woman exclude study ionize radiation teratogenic abortifacient effect . Patients exclude pregnancy test childbearing age 55 year old , documented history infertility acquire congenital disorder incompatible pregnancy patient hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy . Patients also exclude pregnancy test least 50 year age AND menstruate least 12 month OR document Follicle Stimulating Hormone ( FSH ) level great 40 mIU/mL . 4 . Patients total body weight exceed 375 pound since weight limit angiography table .</criteria>
