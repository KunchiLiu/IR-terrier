	<brief_summary>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) plastic stent placement resolution biliary obstruction method choice many year . However , stent clogging/obstruction major limitation management biliary obstruction . Studies show conventional tubular type polyethylene stent ( CS ) side hole accumulate significant sludge mean patency approximately 90 day . Thus patient require long term stenting need undergo stent exchange every 2-3 month . Recently , stent star-shaped cross-section develop biliary application . This FDA approve biliary Wing stent ( WS ) ( ViaDuct™ ) novel plastic biliary stent lack lumen , design allow bile flow outside stent . The stent star shape cross section , channel fluid along wing perimeter . It propose winged stent design lack central lumen obviate risk luminal occlusion risk occlusion , give presence multiple external drainage channel , small . Longer term biliary drainage without need stent exchange therefore possible stent . The primary aim study prospectively evaluate patency rate WS 90 day 50 patient biliary obstruction due stone benign stricture .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Fifty patient meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion invite participate study . 2 . Initial visit : - Written inform consent obtain - Complete history physical perform patient baseline liver function test image result assess noted case report form . - Patients gender , date birth , concomitant medication note . 3 . Procedure : Patients schedule ERCP procedure wing biliary stent placement . They undergo ERCP standard care wing biliary stent place decompression obstruct biliary system situation stenting standard care . One biliary stent may place procedure depend indication biliary stricture necessitate multiple stent placement dilation standard care . 4 . Bloodwork : Patients undergo bloodwork ( total direct bilirubin , alanine aminotransferase , aspartate aminotransferase , alkaline phosphatase ) one week procedure . The degree drop bilirubin also note . The patient labs draw 4 , 8 12 week procedure . 5 . Telephone call : The patient call telephone week 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 procedure monitor clinical status . Patients family member give contact number call u immediately develop sign biliary obstruction fever , abdominal pain , jaundice , dark urine light stool . They also instruct come emergency room develop fever . 6 . Stent removal : At end 90 day stent placement patient return repeat ERCP stent removal standard care endo-therapy indicate . 7 . Stent patency calculate time stent insertion end 90 day . The stent patency rate 90 day proportion stent place occlude time period . Stent occlusion define biochemical clinical evidence obstructive jaundice . 8 . All continuous outcome variable ( stent obstruction ) statistically analyze stent malfunction rate analyze wing stent across various indication .</detailed_description>
