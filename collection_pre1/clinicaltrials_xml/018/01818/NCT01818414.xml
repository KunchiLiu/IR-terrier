	<brief_summary>Cervical preparation second trimester dilation evacuation ( D &amp; E ) reduce risks complication . Osmotic cervical dilator well prostaglandin analogue study cervical preparation . However , optimal method cervical preparation , especially D &amp; E procedure occur day cervical preparation , know . This study investigate misoprostol versus placebo adjunct Dilapan-S cervical preparation same-day D &amp; E 16+0 20+6 week gestation . HYPOTHESIS : Administration 400 µg buccal misoprostol compare placebo least 3 hour prior D &amp; E adjunct cervical preparation Dilapan-S decrease operative time same-day D &amp; E perform 16+0 20+6 week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dilation evacuation ( D &amp; E ) commonly perform second trimester abortion management second trimester intrauterine fetal demise ( IUFD ) . Cervical preparation prior second trimester D &amp; E increase safety . Osmotic cervical dilator prostaglandin analog use widely cervical preparation second trimester D &amp; E . Osmotic dilator place cervical canal , radially expand absorb moisture decrease risk cervical injury D &amp; E . Laminaria tent commonly use osmotic dilator D &amp; E cervical preparation require N18 h reach maximum diameter . Dilapan-S® , synthetic osmotic cervical dilator , significant dilation effect 2 h placement majority expansion occur 4-6 h accord manufacturer . Misoprostol commonly use pharmacologic cervical preparation D &amp; E duration action 2 4 h administration . Multiple study demonstrate safety misoprostol early second trimester abortion . One prospective four retrospective study suggest same-day cervical preparation Dilapan-S and/or misoprostol second trimester D &amp; E 20 week safe effective . Misoprostol may less effective use alone compare overnight osmotic dilator cervical preparation later second trimester adjunctive benefit cervical dilation procedure time use overnight osmotic dilator 16 24 week . The effect appear pronounced N19 week gestation . No prospective study publish examine misoprostol adjunct osmotic dilator cervical preparation same-day D &amp; E . Administration adjunctive misoprostol Dilapan-S potential effectively prepare cervix decrease operative time same-day D &amp; E . We compare cervical preparation Dilapan-S without adjunctive buccal misoprostol same-day D &amp; E 16 0/7 20 6/7 week gestation .</detailed_description>
