	<brief_summary>This randomise observational phase 1 study 48 healthy volunteer age 18-50 . The study assess safety immunogenicity viral vectored vaccine ChAdOx1 NP+M1 MVA NP+M1 heterologous prime-boost regimen . A crossover design allow comparison two vaccine . Volunteers divide 4 group ( n=12 group ) . Groups recruit simultaneously control seasonal change influenza . This certain time year likely higher naturally acquire T cell response influenza time due circulate influenza virus community . The study extend include 2 additional group ( group 5 &amp; 6 ) , contain 12 healthy adult age 50 year . Group 5 receive ChAdOx 1 NP+M1 day 0 , group 6 receive additional boost MVA-NP+M1 8 week later .</brief_summary>
