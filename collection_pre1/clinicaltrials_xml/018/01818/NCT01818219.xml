	<brief_summary>Due recent technological improvement , possible record electrical activity diaphragm ( Eadi ) , direct expression central nervous system respiratory center activity . By provide relatively easy-to-use technique record Eadi NAVA ( Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist ) technology offer new opportunity explore effect various intervention neural inspiratory activity human subject spontaneous assist ventilation normal simulated abnormal respiratory mechanic . The main aim project measure compare component Eadi signal , direct reflect respiratory center activity , various condition normal simulate altered respiratory mechanic ( either obstructive restrictive respiratory mechanicsÂ° order well understand neuroregulation breathing . The second aim present project perform similar analysis regard effect various mode ( Pressure Support NAVA ) various level assist ventilation case normal abnormal respiratory mechanic . Based information record Eadi flow pressure signal , last aim project correlate Eadi pneumatic derive parameter spontaneous breathe assisted ventilation . Practically , use NAVA record technology , investigator perform physiological study normal volunteer explore effect normal simulate abnormal respiratory mechanic Eadi , flow pressure signal ( airway , oesophageal transdiaphragmatic pressure ) order well understand neuroregulation breathing . Thirty healthy volunteer document normal lung function test include study ( obstructive respiratory mechanic simulate 15 healthy volunteer respiratory mechanic simulate 15 healthy volunteer ) .</brief_summary>
