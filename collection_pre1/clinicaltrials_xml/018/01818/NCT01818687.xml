	<criteria>Children age 2 year &lt; 18 year CKD stag 3b 5 , dialysis ( stage 3b define glomerular filtration rate 45 mL/min/1.73 mÂ² ) . The subject document diagnosis hyperphosphataemia , demonstrate serum phosphorus ( P ) level agerelated upper limit normal ( ULN ) ( Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative [ KDOQI ] Clinical Practice Guidelines Nutrition Children CKD updated 2008 ) . The subject stable P diet baseline ( judged Investigator ) . Inclusion criterion subject currently treat phosphate binder : The subject , serum P control despite appropriate P diet , must demonstrate serum P level &gt; 1.5 standard deviation ( SD ) KDOQI 2008 agerelated mean value time screen period . Such subject require washout proceed baseline next visit additional screen visit require . Baseline inclusion criterion subject treat phosphate binder : The subject must enter washout period , he/she must demonstrate serum P level &gt; 1.5 SD KDOQI 2008 agerelated mean value time washout period ( stop phosphate binder ) , ; The subject must demonstrate increase serum P level least 10 % pre washout level ( stop phosphate binder ) . Note : subject fail meet criterion , subject permit rescreened interval least three month . The subject diagnose hypocholesterolaemia ( i.e. , cholesterol level agerelated normal range , per local practice ) The subject current clinically significant medical comorbidities , may substantially compromise subject safety , expose him/her undue risk , interfere significantly study procedure , opinion Investigator , make subject unsuitable inclusion study ( e.g. , subject currently history seizure disorder , dysphagia , swallow disorder , predisposition current bowel obstruction , ileus gastrointestinal [ GI ] disorder chronic severe constipation [ judge Investigator ] , intestinal stenosis , intestinal diverticulum , sigmoid colitis , GI ulcer , current history GI bleeding , major GI tract surgery ) The subject stop treatment ( prescription thecounter ) follow orally take medication washout period : product contain calcium ( Ca ) , magnesium ( Mg ) , aluminium compound , sevelamer , lanthanum , ketosteril The subject receive immunosuppressant treatment medical condition baseline visit expect receive treatment course study The subject consider unstable his/her current treatment CKD within one month prior screen ( e.g. , subject start treatment vitamin D analogue , agents/procedures may influence bone mineral metabolism [ i.e , serum P Ca level ] Exclusion criterion subject treat phosphate binder : The subject treat combination two phosphate binder within one month prior screen</criteria>
