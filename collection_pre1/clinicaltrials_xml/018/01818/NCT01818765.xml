	<brief_summary>Cardiac resynchronization therapy ( CRT ) know result significant improvement symptom select patient heart failure , reduce hospital admission death rate patient . CRT improve cardiac function improve coordination heart beat use special pacemaker . This require wire coronary sinus , one vein run around outside heart , stimulate outside left ventricle ( main pump chamber ) . There two particular issue standard technique . In patient possible get wire coronary sinus due difficult vein shape , others wire put , end suitable position act heart enough improve heart function . This thought major part reason one four patient improve CRT ( `` non-responders '' ) . The investigator develop novel method pacing leave ventricle heart put wire tiny hole make muscle leave right ventricle pace inside surface leave ventricular chamber . This allow patient coronary sinus use CRT . The investigator also offer patient improve CRT , evidence may respond procedure due physiological benefit pace inside rather outside also ability steer lead anywhere inner surface . The investigator perform new procedure small number patient already . This study allow close follow-up patient , also investigation way optimize result procedure patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Interventricular Septal Puncture Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Treat Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>CRT treatment heart failure select patient show decrease hospitalization mortality well improve symptom quality life , hence support guideline include NICE . It achieve place lead pace epicardial leave ventricle ( LV ) via coronary sinus coronary vein . Unfortunately , 5-8 % patient LV lead deliver 15-20 % lead place suboptimal position due presence leave ventricular scarring , phrenic nerve stimulation adverse coronary vein anatomy . After lead delivery , 20-45 % patient undergoing CRT fail respond implant . Suboptimal lead position think one significant cause non-response . In case fail lead placement well-established alternative . The common solution open-chest surgery use thoracotomy place lead epicardial surface heart , procedure considerable morbidity risk death . Given co-morbidity profile patient suitable CRT , severe heart failure , many patient fit enough surgical lead placement . An alternative approach percutaneous procedure pass lead puncture inter-atrial septum across mitral valve , order pace endocardial surface leave ventricle . This achieve complex technically-challenging procedure use femoral subclavian venous access . This approach expose long segment lead systemic circulation , particularly low-pressure , low-flow leave atrium , raise thromboembolic risk . It also worsen mitral regurgitation expose mitral valve risk damage incompetence lead extraction require . Recent study suggest LV endocardial pacing offer number physiological advantage conventional epicardial approach . The lead position site endocardial surface , away scar tissue phrenic nerve site maximal haemodynamic improvement , rather limit venous anatomy , thus improve response CRT . There also evidence endocardial pacing may improve haemodynamics great extent epicardial pacing , animal model acute haemodynamic study human , provide physiological mechanism activation , may less arrhythmogenic . Consistent , response CRT endocardial pacing patient respond epicardial CRT report , response rate previous report LV endocardial pacing high approximately 90 % . Targeting CRT lead placement important factor multiple technique investigate . Targeting lead placement guide site late mechanical activation assess speckle-tracking echocardiography show increase response improve long-term clinical outcome . Anatomy limit epicardial lead position best outcome obtain 60 % patient lead able place optimal site4 . Cardiac output monitoring use guide lead placement maximize cardiac output achieve increase frequency long term improvement cardiac function . Electrical mapping identify site late electrical activation , although yet evidence whether guide lead position improve clinical outcome . No comparison technique perform . There little publish far optimize lead position endocardial LV lead . Groups far use invasive cardiac output monitor assess best position endocardial lead , show optimizes cardiac output time implant . Despite best available evidence guide conventional LV lead position support speckle-tracking echocardiography , yet use guide endocardial lead positioning . The investigator propose investigate novel LV endocardial pacing technique use puncture inter-ventricular septum . This technique develop used Oxford small number patient , initial case series soon submit publication . Potential advantage include inter-ventricular septum puncture subclavian vein access site lead insert , dilate leave ventricular cavity provide large target , reduce complication . Furthermore , lead placement extraction would risk damage mitral valve . All patient leave ventricular endocardial pace lead implant anticoagulated minimize risk stroke systemic thromboembolism . It previously show lead thrombus arise ( right ) atrial lead . The investigator ' study technique would allow LV endocardial pace lead leave atrium , likely reduce thromboembolic stroke risk . It likely significant proportion patient eligible study already warfarin due prior atrial fibrillation indication . Over last 12 month investigator use novel technique 6 patient , LV lead safely deliver without complication . Having refine technique , Phase 2 study aim assess feasibility safety procedure large cohort patient well document echocardiographic , biochemical , functional response . The population study would two group : firstly , patient conventional indication CRT able lead implantation via normal coronary sinus route due adverse anatomy reveal fail prior attempt ; secondly , patient successful conventional CRT lead placement respond therapy ( non-responders ) . Patients fail lead implantation would previously either consider surgical epicardial lead implantation leave CRT device . Non-responders also assess surgical lead implantation felt likely respond . No single technique know define optimal lead positioning , accordingly investigator intend use multiple technique try optimize lead positioning , try find optimal site patient , allow comparison . This would include speckle-tracking echocardiography procedure , well electrical mapping LV activation pattern cardiac output monitoring procedure .</detailed_description>
