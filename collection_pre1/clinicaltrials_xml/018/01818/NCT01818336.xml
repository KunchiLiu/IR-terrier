	<brief_summary>A self- parent-reported history penicillin allergy exclude approximately 10 % US population receive penicillin ( Kerr 1994 , Kagy , Blaiss 1998 , Solensky et al . 2000 , Neugut et al . 2001 ) . Yet approximately 80 % patient label allergic penicillin safely take antibiotic without fear life-threatening reaction ( Gadde et al . 1993 , Macy et al . 1997 ) . The outcomes erroneous classification patient include unnecessary denial effective well-tolerated class antibiotic , often treatment choice . The primary aim skin test Penicillin Skin Test Kit identify subject low risk develop acute IgE-dependent reaction give penicillin cross-reacting drug . The negative predictive value ( NPV ) skin test assessed oral challenge penicillin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , open-label investigation skin test Penicillin Skin Test Kit subject least 18 year age self-reported history possible IgE-dependent penicillin hypersensitivity . At screen Day 1 , subject parents/legal guardian ( applicable ) sign inform consent form/ pediatric assent form . Following consent/assent , demographic information medical history obtain , include prior current medication use . Subjects also ask respiratory infection past 2 week antibiotic within past 4 week . A physical examination perform , along measurement vital sign , subject &gt; 5 year age active asthma , peak expiratory flow rate ( PEFR ) . A urine pregnancy test obtain female subject childbearing potential . The skin test procedure first involve puncture test . Skin test reagent include Penicillin Skin Test Kit , histamine ( positive control ) , sodium chloride ( negative control ) . Subjects negative skin puncture test result drug antigen contain within Penicillin Skin Test Kit undergo intradermal test duplicate . Subjects positive reaction one puncture intradermal test contain within Penicillin Skin Test Kit discharge study . However , subject positive skin test drug antigens Penicillin Skin Test Kit ask return retesting ( puncture intradermal ) 4 week . Subjects negative puncture intradermal test result give oral amoxicillin challenge , comprise single , full oral dose amoxicillin . The purpose oral amoxicillin challenge confirm lack allergy confirm NPV ( Negative Predictive Value ) skin test . Subjects monitor study site 1 hour follow oral amoxicillin challenge send home . The study site follow-up telephone subject ( parents/legal guardian case young child ) â‰¥72 hour administration oral amoxicillin challenge . Adverse event ( AEs ) record administration Penicillin Skin Test throughout 3-day study period spontaneously report subject observe site staff . Two normal subject ( i.e. , history penicillin allergy ) skin test site provide data skin test specificity .</detailed_description>
