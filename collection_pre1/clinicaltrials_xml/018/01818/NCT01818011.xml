	<brief_summary>The primary objective study assess safety , tolerability pharmacokinetics GSK1322322 follow intravenous ( IV ) oral administration . GSK1322322 show broad spectrum antibacterial activity pathogen involve respiratory tract infection well methicillin-resistant S. Aureus ( MRSA ) . This study consist three part ( Part A , Part B Part C ) . The result Part A study enable use large-scale , commercial tablet produce administration patient pivotal clinical trial GSK1322322 . The result Parts B C support enrolment Japanese subject future clinical study . Additionally , result support dose selection clinical development GSK1322322 hospitalize patient severe bacterial infection Japan Asian population . In Part A , subject undergo screening , 4 treatment period receive single dose : 1500 mg Initial , fit-for-purpose tablet ( product code AP ) , 1500 mg Over granulated tablet ( product code AR ) , 1500 mg 2000 mg intend commercial tablet ( product code AU ) . In Part B study subject undergo screening , randomize receive 3 dos GSK1322322 oral cohort ( 100 mg , 1500 mg 2000 mg ) IV cohort ( 600 mg , 900 mg 1200 mg ) 3 treatment period . Part C single-blind , placebo-controlled , repeat dose study GSK1322322 healthy Japanese male subject . GSK1322322 administer ( fast ) via IV 4 day BID , follow administration GSK1322322 orally ( feed ) 6 day BID . A follow-up evaluation conduct 7-10 day follow last dose subject Part study . Approximately 12 subject enrol part study approximately 8 , 6 , 9 subject complete dose critical assessment part A , B , C respectively .</brief_summary>
