	<brief_summary>Skeletal muscle mass decline inactivity ( cast good example ) increase activity ( weightlift ) . Whether muscle mass increase decrease , determine whether new protein within muscle make broken . The investigator know feed protein increase synthesis new protein response older muscle protein feed blunt compare young . This resistance elderly muscle build stimulus may primary reason muscle mass lose age . The investigator also know period muscle disuse cast result person 's muscle shrinking due , investigator believe , low rate synthesis new muscle protein . Age-related muscle loss begin around 50 year old proceeds approximately 1 % every year . Elderly person would likely fare well advance age muscle loss simply linear ; however , rate muscle loss 1 % annually 'population view ' represent occur short period muscle disuse ( i.e . hospitalization illness ) , occur increase frequency elderly person . During period disuse , resistance elderly muscle protein nutrition may worsen . The investigator measure quickly new protein make rest protein feed elderly men , 14 day period reduce activity brought people reduce daily step count .</brief_summary>
