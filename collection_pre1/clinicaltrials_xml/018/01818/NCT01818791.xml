	<brief_summary>As nation , U.S. invest heavily community-based organization conduct intervention , proven research , reduce high rate unplanned pregnancy sexually transmit infection ( STIs ) HIV among teen . Much less invested help community implement program quality . Although many research-based program exist address teen pregnancy STIs , communities face difficulty implement achieve outcome researcher . This `` gap '' resource limit , prevention complex , community often lack capacity—or knowledge , attitude , skills—needed implement `` shelf '' program well . Common way bridge gap , information dissemination , fail change practice outcomes local level part sufficiently address capacity community practitioner . Therefore , build community 's capacity method could improve quality implementation outcome . The propose study use randomize controlled design primary data middle school youth ( 960 ) program staff 32 cooperating Boys Girls Clubs ( Clubs ) ass capacity building intervention call Getting To Outcomes ( GTO ) augment quality implementation research-based intervention improve teen sexual health ( Making Proud Choices , MPC ) . Specifically , study : ( 1 ) Assess utilization subsequent effect GTO program staff capacity implement MPC ; ( 2 ) Assess degree Clubs use GTO show great improvement MPC fidelity Clubs use GTO ; ( 3 ) Assess degree Clubs use GTO show great improvement teen sexual health outcome comparison Clubs . To address aim collect data delivery utilization GTO ( e.g. , method delivery , duration , topic ) ; staff capacity implement research-based intervention ; observation program delivery ( fidelity monitoring ) ; youth participant ' sexual activity , pregnancy , STIs , condom use , knowledge/ attitude towards sex . Analyses examine difference intervention control sit time , account cluster youth within site . These outcome important NICHD 's focus provide opportunity youth become healthy productive adult .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Since 2005 , great priority improve teen sexual health outcome increase teen pregnancy rate high rate teens report sexual intercourse ( approximately 50 % high school teen ) . In 2006 , approximately 7 % U.S. woman age 20 become pregnant—152.8 pregnancy per 1,000 woman age 15 193-which high pregnancy rate among industrialized nation . Adolescents sex great risk sexually transmitted infection , include HIV . Practicing unsafe sex child teen come great cost society term lose productivity increase health care spending young parent child experience range poor health educational outcome . Middle school , age 11-14 , key time focus sexual health pregnancy prevention immediately prior time many youth become sexually active . Evidence-based program ( EBPs ) middle school youth show improve teen sexual health outcome , include increase use contraception , decreased number sexual partner pregnancy , delay first sexual intercourse . However , community-based organization face difficulty implement EBPs fidelity resource limit , EBPs complex implement , program staff often lack capacity—or knowledge , attitude , skills—needed adopt implement EBPs effectively . As result , community-based organization unable achieve outcomes demonstrated researcher . Although research evidence base grow quickly—with 50 EBPs show improve teen sex outcomes16—the science need promote successful implementation program community-based setting poorly develop . Previous effort help improve adoption implementation EBPs prevent teen pregnancy either improve implementation EBPs , document support provide program implementers translate improvement teen sexual health outcome . Large community trial focus adoption implementation EBPs target teen sexual health outcome need assess type amount support help community-based organization implement EBPs fidelity achieve outcome similar achieve research . Therefore , goal 5-year study conduct multi-state , communitybased trial ass capacity-building intervention call Getting To Outcomes affect three variable interest : 32 Boys Girls Clubs ' capacity adopt implement EBP ( Making Proud Choices MPC ) , fidelity MPC implementation , sex outcome middle school youth serve . The capacity building intervention program staff call Getting To Outcomes ( GTO ) provide techincal assistance , training , manual improve community-based practitioner ' capacity complete task associate implement EBP , turn lead improved implementation fidelity . Improved implementation fidelity EBPs like Making Proud Choices lead improve teen sexual health outcome . In quasi-experimental case study , GTO show effective help community-based organization implement substance abuse prevention EBPs fidelity document outcome . GTO later adapt CDC 5-year Promoting Science Based Approaches Teen Pregnancy Prevention Project ( PSBA-GTO ) . However , CDC evaluate GTO 's impact program fidelity teen sexual health outcome . The propose randomized , control trial would build tool develop PSBA-GTO GTO project compare staff capacity , program fidelity , teen sexual health outcome across 16 Boys Girls Clubs implement MPC fashion typical community setting ( 8 Atlanta , 8 Alabama ) 16 Boys Girls Clubs implement MPC augment GTO ( also 8 Atlanta , 8 Alabama ) . The specific aim investigator-initiated R01 : 1 . Assess ( ) utilization ( b ) subsequent effect GTO program staff capacity implement EBPs 2 . Assess degree Boys Girls Clubs use GTO show great improvement MPC fidelity Boys Girls Clubs use GTO 3 . Assess degree middle-school-aged youth enrol Boys Girls Clubs use GTO show great improvement sexual health outcome Boys Girls Clubs use GTO This study potential document , first time , capacity-building intervention ( GTO ) help community-based organization implement EBPs improve teen sexual health outcome . This information critical state particularly federal government allocate substantial fund implement EBPs prevent teen pregnancy community-based setting ( e.g. , FY 2010 Administration Children Families Office Adolescent Health dedicate $ 110 million ) . As , propose study inform ongoing debate best improve implementation EBPs achieve good teen sexual health outcome educate policymakers ' resource need successful implementation EBPs large scale .</detailed_description>
