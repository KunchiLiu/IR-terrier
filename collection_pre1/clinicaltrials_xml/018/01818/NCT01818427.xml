	<brief_title>PreHospital Air Medical Plasma Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Although advance care severely injured patient occur last decade , patient continue plague uncontrolled hemorrhage result significant early mortality development multiple organ failure associate complication . A primary driving force unbridled hemorrhage show early coagulopathy complicates severe injury . Increasing evidence suggest blood component transfusion protocols address early coagulopathy , patient arrives trauma center , associate low mortality reduction blood component transfusion requirement . Prehospital intervention quell early coagulopathy earlier set potential minimize even prevent vicious hemorrhagic cascade , lower blood component transfusion requirement reduce resultant morbid sequela complicates severe injury . Objective/Hypothesis : The primary hypothesis prehospital infusion plasma air medical transport patient hemorrhagic shock lower 30 day mortality . The secondary hypothesis include prehospital infusion plasma reduce 24 hour blood transfusion , multiple organ failure , nosocomial infection , acute lung injury , reduce prevent early coagulopathy demonstrate improve present coagulation thromboelastography parameter , reduce early inflammatory cytokine response , thrombomodulin increase protein C level .</detailed_description>
