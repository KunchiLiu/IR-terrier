	<brief_title>The Efficacy Using Volunteers Implement Cognitive Stimulation Program Two Long-Term Care Homes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Older adult maintain cognitive skill ability able live independently whose skill deteriorate . The cost ( money , time , personnel ) associate provide cognitive stimulation program resident long-term care home often prohibit delivery program . The present study explore efficacy use volunteer administer stimulation program two long-term care home . The program focus stimulate reasoning , attention , memory ability use uncomplicated , pen-and-paper exercise . Thirty-six resident participant 16 volunteer participant randomly assign one two parallel group , either control stimulation group . For eight week , three time week , control group participant meet standard `` friendly visit '' ( casual conversation resident volunteer ) stimulation group participant meet work variety exercise meant stimulate cognitive ability resident . Results analyze use 2-way ANOVA indicate statistically significant Group x Time interaction Verbal Memory ( F ( 1 , 33 ) = 7.92 , p = .008 ) , Non-Verbal Memory ( F ( 1 , 33 ) = 6.8 , p = .014 ) , Learning ( F ( 1 , 33 ) = 5.27 , p = .028 ) , Verbal Fluency ( F ( 1 , 33 ) = 5.56 , p = .024 ) . Volunteers complete post-study questionnaire indicate volunteer stimulation group find skills-based interaction stimulate resident . Given show improved resident ability , reasonable assert study demonstrate volunteer-administered , cognitive stimulation program provide measurable gain cognitive ability older adult . Further study concern role volunteer maintenance cognitive ability older adult recommend .</detailed_description>
