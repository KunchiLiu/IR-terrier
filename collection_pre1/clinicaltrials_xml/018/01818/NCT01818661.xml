	<brief_title>Longitudinal Multi-Modality Imaging Progressive Apraxia Speech</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Apraxia Speech ( AOS ) disorder speech motor plan and/or program affect production speech , characterize slow speaking rate , abnormal prosody distort sound substitution , addition , repetition prolongation , sometimes accompanied groping , trial error articulatory movement . While AOS commonly associate vascular insult , predominant manifestation neurodegenerative disease . Apraxia speech manifestation neurodegenerative disorder . However , AOS often co-occur aphasia , particularly non-fluent aphasia ( NFA ) Broca 's type ; language disorder , typically characterize agrammatic , telegraphic truncate spoken language , often accompany similar difficulty write language . Patients neurodegenerative AOS vary degree NFA , aphasia consider severe AOS patient , AOS dominant others . It extremely rare patient present NFA also AOS . Patients isolate AOS develop NFA time , although patient AOS remain isolated many 8-10 year . Patients AOS also develop dysarthria non-speech motor symptom , extrapyramidal feature , postural instability , extra ocular eye movement abnormality limb apraxia . Cognitive impairment also develop , although rarely early feature disease . The syndrome progressive many patient eventually become mute . Studies show patient neurodegenerative AOS pathologically heterogeneous , case show deposition microtubule associate protein tau , others deposition TAR DNA bind protein 43kDa ( TDP-43 ) . Typical tau pathology observe include corticobasal degeneration , progressive supranuclear palsy ( PSP ) Pick 's disease . Clinical feature currently unhelpful predict underlying pathology case , although suggestion case isolate dominant AOS may likely show tau pathology , particularly PSP . This project first assess longitudinal multi-modality neuroimaging subject neurodegenerative AOS . It allow u assess aspect disease progression subject , include change neuroimaging , speech language , neurological , neuropsychological assessment , get complete picture dysfunction progression subject . This project also first apply DTI recently develop technique rest state fMRI study disease . These technique great current interest field provide , first time , way assess underlying functional structural connectivity across brain . Both technique provide important information disease progress brain tissue huge potential important future biomarkers many different neurodegenerative disease .</detailed_description>
