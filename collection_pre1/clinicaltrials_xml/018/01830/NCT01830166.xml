	<brief_summary>This project develop evaluate treatment plan prostate focal therapy base low dose rate brachytherapy . The participant enter study suitable active surveillance . These participant monitor various image method intervention MR elastography , Transrectal ultrasound elastography , PET/CT transperineal mapping biopsy determine extent cancer suitable treatment . Those suitable focal therapy offer option low dose rate brachytherapy ( LDRB ) focal therapy addition active surveillance radical therapy . This study use evaluate long term use multi-modal , multi-parametric prostate cancer imaging , combine data MRI , ultrasound 11C-choline PET/CT . Such method use eliminate need invasive method map biopsy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Focal Therapy Prostate Cancer - A Pilot Study Focal Low Dose Rate Brachytherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Purpose To test efficacy , acute side effect long term safety Focal Therapy Prostate Cancer , compare conventional radical lose dose radiation prostate brachytherapy ( LDR-PB ) . 2 . Hypothesis We hypothesize , appropriately select group early-stage , favourable risk prostate cancer patient , focal LDR-PB lead few acute side effect , long term complication result good quality life radical LDR-PB . We also hypothesize multi-modal , multi-parametric image enable monitoring result focal therapy accuracy high enough eventually replace repeat ( invasive ) mapping biopsy . 3 . Justification The imaging study propose unique term multi-modality , multi-parametric approach . Local disease monitor complete set multi-parametric MR , ultrasound PET-CT imaging . Potential spread disease may capture abdominal whole-body PET-CT . Comparison biopsy accurate study biopsy location accurately provide trans-perineal three-dimensional template-guided pathological mapping biopsy ( TTMB ) , contrast Post-radical prostatectomy ( RP ) study use axial whole mount slice suffer significant change prostate physical shape unpredictable deformation due fixation , make accurate registration pathology image difficult . The impact study field medical imaging also significant . Advances topic deformable multi-modal registration , dosimetry , characterization cancer image feature MR , ultrasound PET-CT expect . These finding widely disseminate paper address clinical technical publication . We aware study TTMB-guided focal brachytherapy implement test . A center size , record outcome , complete set image expertise tool help patient selection monitoring , may make significant impact focal therapy implement evaluate . Therefore , potential provide valuable input translate focal therapy standard care appropriately select patient . 4 . Objectives The specific objective study : 1 . To develop provisional criterion constitute focal disease treatment plan appropriate focal LDR-PB . 2 . To show patient undergoing focal therapy well quality life undergo radical therapy . 3 . To correlate multi-modal , multi-parametric imaging result result map biopsy goal develop image-based technique patient selection monitoring . 5 . Research Method Participants study undergo multi-modal , multi-parametric imaging outline study protocol ( MRI , Ultrasound imaging , PET/CT ) . Participants eligible continue study receive focal therapy undergo 3D- Template-Guided Trans-Perineal Pathological Mapping Biopsy ( TTMB ) . Participants also ask complete study survey repeat pathological mapping do 2 year post treatment.. 6 . Statistical Analysis In recruiting plan , assume approximately 50 % participant initially eligible continue focal therapy . The planned sample size pilot study 10 . Imaging hypothesis : The hypothesis focal treatment change image treated area tissue property leave unchanged property tissue untreated area test use pair data participant .</detailed_description>
