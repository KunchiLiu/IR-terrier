	<brief_title>Feasibility Study New MRI Protocol Assessing Early Blood Brain Barrier Disruption ( BBBD ) Related Delay Brain Edema</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research 's Protocol : Evaluation Correlation disruption blood-brain-barrier development secondary brain edema associate brain damage use MRI patient various type intra-cranial bleeding . Research team : Main ( Primary researcher ) : Sagi Harnof MD , Neurosurgery department , Sheba medical center , Tel Hashomer Secondary researcher : Prof. David Tanne ( M.D ) , Neurology department . Dr. Yael Mardor ( PhD ) , Advanced technology department . Dr. Oded Goren ( M.D ) , Neurosurgery department . Dr. Masswadeh Ahmad ( M.D ) , Neurosurgery Department . Background : Spontaneous brain hemorrhage one difficult issue stroke concept regard underlie pathology , reason treatment . Etiology : - General prevalence approximately 10-15 % stroke . - Mortality morbidity associate severe mortality rate 50-60 % . There various pathology think responsible bleeding , commonly know : hypertension , Angiopathies , amyloidotic vascular problem space occupy lesion . Treatment process take place limited patient treat conservatively . Cytotoxic brain edema develop around bleed result usually local cell damage local pressure . It usually increase first day bleed consider one main cause deterioration cerebral hemorrhage . Sub-dural cerebral hemorrhage common disease due traumatic injury , often serious consequence . Regarding natural history subdural bleeding , It 's believe difficult predict bleeding 's course , risk induce cerebral edema later develop chronic sub Dural bleeding unpredictable well . Nevertheless chronic sub-dural bleed one common case see neurosurgery practice , But worthy notify little know pathogenesis disease , appearance symptom , preferable time drainage complication . Although n't contribute much clinical evaluation stoke , MRI grow importance field stroke lately . In previous neuro-imaging research include patient ischemic stroke show innovative methodology base leakage extravasation ) contrast agent MRI allow map entire brain high resolution , easily evaluate sensitivity disorder BBB . In 27 % patient show anomaly BBB normal MRI , calculate map late leakage show significant volume BBB open ischemic area . MRI research Group Advanced Technology Center Sheba Medical Center develop innovative methodology base leakage ( extravasation ) contrast agent allow map entire brain high resolution high sensitivity check describe disorder BBB . Data Acquisition : MRI perform use General Electric ( GE ) T3.0/1.5 standard head coil 8 channel . MRI scan include high-resolution spin-echo T1-weighted MRI , acquire several time point injection ( 1 , 12 , 20 , 23 , 30 , 70 minute injection ) . T1-MRI may do Echo Time ( TE ) / Repetition Time ( TR ) = 22/240 m , field view 26 x 19.5 inch , 5/0.5 mm slice thickness 512x512 - pixel . To notify : T1-MRI data acquire simultaneously conventional image protocol accept Sheba Medical center routine practice . ( Sheba 's routine ) . Type study : A prospective feasibility study perform group patient cerebral hemorrhage . The purpose study : 1 . Assess ability characterize quantitatively BBB disruption around cerebral hemorrhage . 2 . Find correlation degree BBBD immediately bleed cerebral edema 3-5 day bleed . 3 . Search clinical correlation degree BBBD immediately bleed clinical course follow later . Methods : This prospective study aim test feasibility use BBBD protocol MRI order predict development edema clinical deterioration . Course experiment : Once -on call- neurosurgery resident notify patient spontaneous ICH would contact researcher begin screen process participation study . Patients undergone intracranial hemorrhage ( ICH ) discover past twelve hour undergo screen process perform researcher order determine whether meet inclusion criterion . Such patient may arrive emergency room , intensive care unit ward hospital . 3 . An initial Baseline MRI do : 1. spontaneous ICH bleed - within 6-24 hour bleed . 2. chronic sub dural bleed - time diagnosis . 3. acute sub-dural bleeding - within 6-24 hour bleed . It emphasize purpose MRI ass extent BBBD intend research purpose . This MRI protocol allow complete diagnostic assessment . . Whether patient need accompany doctor MRI , solely determine researcher , depend patient 's clinical situation . 4 . Clinical follow-up : neurological status , registration National Institutes Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS questionnaire ) . a- spontaneous bleed - Daily monitoring &amp; register National Institutes Health Stroke Scale ( NIHSS ) five consequent day . Additional clinical follow-up perform two week later . b- chronic acute sub-dural bleeding follow visit 14 day . 5. second MRI serve review : 1. spontaneous intra-cranial bleeding : 3rd -5th day bleed . 2 . For chronic sub Dural bleeding : within two week . 3 . For acute sub Dural bleeding : within two week . 6 . Two month later , third MRI review type bleed . 7 . Result - Analysis outcomes follow : Search correlation BBBD clinical status . Search BBBD correlation hematoma growth . Search correlation BBBD development cerebral edema . Search correlation BBBD growth process Chronic Subdural Hematoma ( CSDH ) Search correlation BBBD drainage CSDH . Search correlation BBBD Acute Subdural Hematoma ( ASDH ) convert CSDH .</detailed_description>
