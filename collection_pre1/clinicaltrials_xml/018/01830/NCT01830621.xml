	<brief_summary>The purpose study find whether good receive new drug , BBI608 , well receive treatment colon rectal cancer . To , half patient study get BBI608 half receive placebo ( substance design anything ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>BBI608 Best Supportive Care v Placebo Best Supportive Care Patients With Pretreated Advanced Colorectal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research do currently approve remain effective treatment colon rectal cancer . The purpose study compare effect colon cancer new drug , BBI608 , best supportive care ( BSC ) compare BSC alone . BBI608 show shrink tumour animal study people seem promising , clear offer well result usual care best supportive care alone . The standard usual treatment disease treatment drug treatment may help make patient feel well may improve quality life . This treatment know `` best supportive care '' ( BSC ) . Although patient best supportive care feel well month , cancer usually continue grow .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm advanced colorectal cancer unresectable . Received prior thymidylate synthase inhibitor ( e.g . 5fluorouracil ( 5FU ) , capecitabine , raltitrexed , UFT ) metastatic disease adjuvant therapy . Received failed irinotecan contain regimen ( i.e . singleagent combination ) treatment metastatic disease , OR relapse within 6 month completion irinotecancontaining adjuvant therapy , OR document unsuitability irinotecancontaining regimen . Received fail oxaliplatincontaining regimen treatment metastatic disease , OR relapse within 6 month completion oxaliplatincontaining adjuvant therapy OR document unsuitability oxaliplatincontaining regimen . For patient colorectal cancer Kras wild type : Received fail cetuximab panitumumabcontaining regimen ( i.e . singleagent combination ) treatment metastatic disease OR document unsuitability cetuximab panitumumabcontaining regimen The remain standard available therapy recommend Investigator best supportive care . Must presence measurable disease define Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumours ( RECIST 1.1 ) . Imaging investigation include CT/MRI chest/abdomen/pelvis scan necessary document site disease do within 14 day prior randomization . Must ECOG Performance Status 0 1 . Must ≥ 18 year age . For male female patient child produce potential : Must agree use contraception take measure avoid pregnancy study 30 day last Protocol treatment dose . Women child bear potential ( WOCBP ) must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 72 hour prior randomization . Must alanine transaminase ( ALT ) ≤ 3 × institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) [ ≤ 5 × ULN presence liver metastases ] within 14 day prior randomization . Must hemoglobin ( Hgb ) ≥ 80 g/L within 14 day prior randomization . Must total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × institutional ULN [ ≤ 2.0 x ULN presence liver metastases ] within 14 day prior randomization . Must creatinine ≤ 1.5 × institutional ULN Creatinine Clearance &gt; 50 ml/min within 14 day prior randomization . Must absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 x 109/L within 14 day prior randomization . Must platelet count ≥ 75 x 109/L within 14 day prior randomization . Other biochemistry must do within 14 day prior randomization include lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ) alkaline phosphatase . Patient must consent provision , investigator ( ) must confirm access agree submit request NCIC CTG Central Tumour Bank , representative formalin fix paraffin block tumour tissue order specific correlative marker assay may conduct . Patient must consent provision sample blood order specific correlative marker assay may conduct . Patient able ( i.e . sufficiently fluent ) willing complete Quality Life Health Utilities questionnaires one validated languages questionnaire . Patients must accessible treatment followup . Patients register trial must treat follow participate centre . This imply must reasonable geographical limit place patient consider trial . Protocol treatment begin within 2 work day patient randomization . The patient receive therapy concurrent clinical study patient agree participate clinical study participation trial study treatment . Anticancer chemotherapy biologic therapy within less ) 21 day , ii ) usual cycle length regimen ( e.g . 14 day FOLFOX ) , prior first plan dose BBI608/placebo . An exception make capecitabine regorafenib , minimum 10 day since last dose must observe prior first plan dose BBI608/placebo . Radiotherapy , immunotherapy , investigational agent within four week first plan dose BBI608/placebo , exception single dose radiation 8 Gray ( equal 800 RAD ) palliative intent pain control 14 day randomization . Major surgery within 4 week prior randomization . Any known symptomatic brain metastasis require steroid . Women pregnant breastfeeding . Gastrointestinal disorder ( ) , opinion Qualified/Principal Investigator , would significantly impede absorption oral agent ( e.g . active Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis , extensive gastric small intestine resection ) . Unable unwilling swallow BBI608/placebo capsule daily . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , clinically significant nonhealing heal wound , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia , significant pulmonary disease ( shortness breath rest mild exertion ) , uncontrolled infection psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients history malignancy except : adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , curatively treated insitu cancer cervix , solid tumour curatively treat evidence disease ≥ 5 year . Prior treatment BBI608 . Any active disease condition would render protocol treatment dangerous impair ability patient receive protocol therapy . Any condition ( e.g . psychological , geographical , etc . ) permit compliance protocol .</criteria>
