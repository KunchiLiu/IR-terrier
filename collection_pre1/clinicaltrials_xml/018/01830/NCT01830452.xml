	<brief_title>Less Chronic Pain After Lichtenstein Hernioplasty Using Self-gripping Parietex Progrip Mesh</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION In 1984 Lichtenstein popularize routine use heavy weight polypropylene mesh fix non-absorbable suture create tension-free hernioplasty . This technique become gold standard many clinic due low rate recurrence direct post-operative pain6 . Focus shift occurrence chronic pain neuralgia Lichtenstein hernioplasty . Chronic post-operative pain define pain last 3 month surgery . The surgical repair technique seem important etiologic factor . This include aspect like type mesh use , manner fixation prosthetic material handle cutaneous nerve . The aim study investigate difference incidence chronic post-operative pain two type fixation mesh . The mesh use ligthweight make polyester . The mesh fixate either non-adsorbable suture , accord Lichtenstein , small microhooks low surface mesh ( Parietex Progrip Mesh , Covidien ) . Rationale Parietex Progrip Mesh To reduce post-operative chronic pain think important use low weight large pore size oligofilament mesh fix minimal use device device . This minimize compression/entrapment neuropathy inflammation . The Parietex Progrip mesh biocompatibility enhance use low-weight monofilament isoelastic polyester large pore . The hydrophilic characteristic polyester know cause less shrinkage fibrotic tissue formation standard polypropylene . The need fixate device bypass small absorbable microhooks ( polyactid acid , PLA ) surface Progrip Mesh . Mesh fixation micro hook underlie groin tissue achieve instantly exert light pressure mesh . The fixation micro-hooks achieve fully mesh area contrast mesh margin mesh suture . Therefore likely less risk movement displacement hernial sac mesh . The PLA micro hook completely resorbed 15 month . Then mesh firmly connect groin bed tissue ingrow . After resorption PLA low-weight ( 38 g/m2 ) monofilament polyester ( PP ) leave situ . The mesh oval shape self-gripping flap place around spermatic cord internal ring . A recently perform pilotstudy compare Parietene ( make polypropylene ) Progrip mesh standard mesh clinic , heavy weight suture polypropylene mesh , reveal significant low incidence chronic pain Parietene Progrip group ( P=0.012 ) . Recurrence rate different . Operation time significantly short Parietene Progrip Mesh group. ( p=0.002 ) . METHODS Study objective The aim compare two type fixation mesh inguinal hernia repair describe Lichtenstein ; lightweight polyester mesh suture compare lightweight polyester mesh self-gripping property need fixate device . It already prove lightweight mesh reduce amount foreign body reaction result less chronic pain . The self fix property believe enhance effect minimize entrapment muscle nerve fibre . Primary endpoint The primary endpoint amount post-operative chronic groin pain . This evaluate use visual analogue scale ( VAS ) Mc Gill Pain questionnaire . In subgroup 50 patient amount pain en pain threshold hernioplasty objectify quantitative sensory testing ( QST ) . Secondary endpoint Secondary objective recurrence rate , per operative post-operative complication , operate time , duration hospital stay , cost , return work daily activity , QOL , genital sexual problem . Study design The HIPPO trial multicenter double blind randomize clinical trial . Preoperative randomization do use official randomisation program . All include study subject register program . On day surgery operation assistant login randomisation program start randomisation procedure patient operate . The outcome appear couple second store secured database . Which type mesh use know surgeon earlier preparation inguinal floor finish surgeon ready place mesh . In case patient sleeping operation possible notice whether mesh fixed suture . To sure happen patient want sleep get ear-radio eye mask . The investigator assess outcome outpatient department inform outcome randomisation . Besides , operation report mention type mesh use . The randomisation code broken owner randomisation program , case medical urgency order medical doctor . Patients Patients include outpatient clinic department General Surgery departing hospital . This do surgeon supervise resident . After inclusion patient sign informant consent fill couple questionnaire : SF36 ( Short Form , measure quality life ) , McGill pain questionnaire , VAS , Dutch Inguinal hernia questionnaire ( validate ) . Follow-up 2weeks , 3 month , 12 month 24 month post-operatively . For follow-up visit patient complete questionnaire home . Besides examine clinic detection complication ( eg recurrence , wound problem ) perform sensibility test . Subjects leave study time reason wish without consequence . The investigator decide withdraw subject study urgent medical reason Inclusion criterion - Primary unilateral inguinal hernia - Capacitated male person - Age ≥ 18 year Exclusion criteria - Concurrent femoral hernia - Incarcerated strangulated inguinal hernia - ASA 4 ASA 5 - Impaired adequate follow - Participation another trial Sample size calculation The primary endpoint VAS score . A difference 10 post-operative Visual Analogue Scale score intervention control group consider minimum relevant clinical difference . According power analyse , 169 patient per treatment group need achieve power 80 % alpha 5 % . The calculation make two-sided test VAS pain score 3 month . Based pilotstudie standard deviation set 20 . Statistical comparison make use Wilcoxon test continuous data Pearson chi square test ordinal data . The Wilcoxon test also use analyse SF36 score nominal operative parameter . P &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Ethics , inform consent The study conduct accord principle Declaration Helsinki 59th amend World Medical Association General Assembly , Seoul , October accordance Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act ( WMO ) . The protocol approve independent ethic committee participate hospital Leiden University Medical Centre . All patient ask co-operate study verbally inform patient information letter . The handle personal date comply Dutch Personal Data Protection Act . Data save maximal 5 year public disclosure research result . Diagnosis An inguinal hernia define protrusion content abdominal cavity preperitoneal fat hernia defect inguinal area congenital acquire . This situation give rise complaint discomfort pain . Conform recommendation EHS ( European Hernia Society , last version 2009 ) diagnosis inguinal hernia establish mean physical examination . Groin diagnostic investigation perform patient obscure pain and/or swelling . The inguinal hernia classify use EHS classification . Anesthesia Pre-operatively patient see anaesthetist pre-operative outpatient clinic . The type anaesthesia ( general spinal short act agent ) decide anaesthetist take account preference patient . There standard protocol general spinal anaesthesia . Surgical technique The inguinal hernia correct accord Lichtenstein , describe Amid et . This treatment recommend primary unilateral inguinal hernia Dutch Society Surgeons European Hernia Society . In half study population lightweigth polyester mesh ( Parietex Mesh , Covidien ) use , fix non-absorbable suture describe Amid . In half lightweigth self grip polyester mesh ( Parietex Progrip Mesh , Covidien ) use . This mesh place way suture mesh e.g . tension free posterior wall inguinal canal 1cm overlap pubic bone inguinal ligament . The self grip flap close loosely around spermatic cord . Fixation achieve apply light pressure mesh . No fixating suture ( ) necessary . The parietex progrip mesh preshaped , correction size allow make . Conform recommendation EHS inguinal nerve risk ( ilio-inguinal , iliohypogastric genitofemoral nerve ) try identify , may reduce risk nerve damage post-operative groin pain . In principle nerve preserve , case damage interference mesh resect . It recommend , case large hernia sac , transection hernia sac perform distal hernia sac leave undisturbed , prevent ischaemic orchitis . If necessary , large direct hernia suture tension-free continuous soluble suture flat posterior wall create normal internal ring . Operations perform surgeon supervise resident . Post-operative pain control recovery After hernia repair wound locally infiltrate analgesic provide extra pain control limit use analgesic . The amount painkiller give patient depend VAS score . This standardise regimen base current practice . Post-operative painkiller include paracetamol 1 gram four time daily diclofenac 50 gram three time daily . When satisfy tramadol 50mg 3 time daily give . According EHS limitation place patient follow inguinal hernia operation patient , therefore , free resume activity . They advise limit heavy weight lift 2-3 week surgery . CONCLUSION The HIPPO double blind randomise control trial aim show reduction chronic pain anterior inguinal hernia repair placement self grip Parietex Progrip Mesh compare mesh suture accord Lichtenstein . Hypothetically Parietex Progrip Mesh reduce chronic pain compare Lichtenstein less harm underlie nerve muscle fiber . Competing interest The author declare compete interest . Objective analysis perform TULIP data . There violate study protocol .</detailed_description>
