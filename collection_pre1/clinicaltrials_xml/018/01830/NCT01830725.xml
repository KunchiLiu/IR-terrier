	<detailed_description>Background : Our recent gout study demonstrate relationship xanthine oxidase ( XO ) single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) 2107A &gt; G dose allopurinol need reach goal serum uric acid level 6 mg/dL less . This study limitation suggest specific SNPs could relate dose allopurinol need treat . Objective : To determine relationship multiple purine enzyme SNPs gene encode PRPS1 , HPRT1 , XO dose xanthine oxidase inhibitor need achieve goal treatment uric acid level less 6 mg/dL . Another primary outcome determine relationship two XO SNPs hyperuricemia/gout . A secondary outcome determine frequency SNPs test . Design : Patients consent enrollment either gout/hyperuricemia group control group . Control group patient neither gout hyperuricemia . No patient enrol overproducers uric acid . It anticipate 200 patient enrol group total 400 patient next 2 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The study open adult age 18 year age satisfy least one condition : Have asymptomatic hyperuricemia ( serum uric acid level &gt; 7.0 mg/dL ) least 2 separate occasion , Clinical diagnosis gout , Have neither asymptomatic hyperuricemia gout serve part control group ( approximate age/gender match control ) To best isolate relationship purine enzyme SNPs hyperuricemia gout treatment , factor could elevate serum uric acid level independent protein function need exclude . Specifically , patient `` overproducers '' serum uric acid exclude : Have myeloproliferative disorder ( hematologic malignancy leukemia lymphoma ) Are actively receive therapy neoplasia ( aside nonmelanoma skin cacner ) Have great 5 % skin involvement psoriasis Have know history xanthinuria Consume 14 drink per week alcoholic beverage Patients pregnant nursing enrol . Patients enrol control group also exclude enrollment condition .</criteria>
