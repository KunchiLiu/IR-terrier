	<detailed_description>A total 60 patient , single center , meet study inclusion criterion none study exclusion criterion prospectively enrol study . Qualifying patient refer study site clinically indicate , non-emergent cardiac catheterization NIRS evaluation , either proceed follow coronary artery calcium score ( CACS ) evaluation . Qualifying patient refer directly cardiac catheterization NIRS assessment secondary symptom abnormal functional test send cardiac CACS assessment follow catheterization discharge hospital . In group , patient require ad hoc PCI upon initial angiography exclude avoid artifact CACS . In patient refer clinically indicated cardiac catheterization IVUS evaluation within 3 month MDCT CACS , NIRS least two ( 2 ) major epicardial vessel complete prior ( necessary ) coronary revascularization .</detailed_description>
