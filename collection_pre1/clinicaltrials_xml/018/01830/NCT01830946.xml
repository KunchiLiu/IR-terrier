	<brief_summary>Obesity recognize major public health concern link potential fatal complication arise metabolic cardiovascular disease . Despite many pharmacological advance field , lifestyle strategy emphasize proper nutrient intake physical activity continue primary strategy individual fight obesity . However , controversy exists regard type timing exercise specific nutrient intake maximize fat loss , muscle gain , beneficial cardio-metabolic adaptation derive lifestyle intervention . Furthermore , limit data exists investigate impact nutrient timing time immediately exercise study examine time-of-day nutritional intake overweight obese individuals.In addition , many individual attempt improve body composition cardio-metabolic health concern food choice appropriate late evening support positive physiological adaptation . However , research-based information examine topic scarce . The investigator hypothesize consumption protein beverage late evening sleep improve body composition , cardio-metabolic health , adaptation exercise isocaloric placebo beverage . The investigator also hypothesize different digestion absorption kinetics whey casein protein elicit different effect measure variable .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nighttime Macronutrient Choice Combined Resistance High-intensity Interval Training</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study examine effect consumption protein beverage late evening sleep along combination resistance high-intensity interval train improve body composition , muscle strength overall health compare carbohydrate placebo beverage overweight obese individual . Specifically , measure heart rate , blood pressure , body composition , rest metabolism , maximal strength , cardiovascular function , hormone level , blood lipid profile , appetite , mood state , dietary intake . Specific aim study : To determine acute ingestion liquid ready-to-drink protein supplement ( 30g whey casein protein per serve ) consume late evening sleep alter physiological milieu favor anabolism alter lipolysis fat oxidation carbohydrate placebo ( 34g maltodextrin per serve ) . To determine 4 week daily protein supplementation ( supplement ) late evening along 3 day exercise train per week improve body composition , blood lipid profile , strength , cardiovascular risk profile placebo beverage .</detailed_description>
