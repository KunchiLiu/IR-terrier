	<detailed_description>The prognosis survival rate breast cancer vary depend extent disease , performance status patient type tumour include status oestrogen receptor ( ER ) , progesterone receptor ( PR ) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) . Expression ER PR generally indicate good prognosis overexpression HER2 triple negative breast cancer generally indicate aggressive cancer high growth rate [ 1 ] . Preoperative neoadjuvant therapy also know primary systemic therapy follow surgery adjuvant radiation therapy recommend patient locally advance breast cancer [ 2 ] . Studies use primary systemic therapy demonstrate useful rate clinical response pathological complete response ( pCR ) rate breast alone pathological complete response rate axillary note . The response rate vary considerably , however response rate cytotoxic chemotherapy uniformally high ER negative tumor . There additional improvement pathological complete response rate 10 % addition taxane [ 4 ] . For operable breast cancer , primary systemic therapy consider alternative adjuvant systemic therapy patient require mastectomy desire breast conservation surgery . In patient large tumour technically lumpectomy , primary systemic therapy may permit less extensive surgery may result good cosmetic result . Primary systemic therapy may also advisable patient medical contraindication surgery delay surgery require . Nanoparticle albumin bound paclitaxel report achieve high intracellular tumour paclitaxel concentration via albumin mediate transendothelial transport system [ 5 ] . Better tolerability efficacy demonstrate compare paclitaxel docetaxel treatment metastatic breast cancer [ 6 , 7 ] . Nab paclitaxel evaluate adjuvant treatment patient breast cancer [ 8 , 9 ] neoadjuvant set [ 10 . ] The preoperative setting provide opportunity study early molecular change may occur response treatment . Alteration biomarkers pre post chemotherapy include hormone receptor , Human Epidermal growth factor receptor ( HER2 ) Ki67 [ 11 , 12 ] well gene pathway [ 13 ] area possible exploration neoadjuvant study whereby tissue available analysis chemotherapy treatment . Particular pattern reduction tumour size MRI predictive successful response , detect residual tumour apparent mammogram U/S accurate evaluation tumour volume [ 14 . ] Functional image biomarkers response also potential utility assess treatment response [ 15 . ] A recent study report 4 cycle adjuvant therapy combination nab Paclitaxel cyclophosphamide , without trastuzumab , feasible well tolerated patient early stage breast cancer . Another small study demonstrate feasibility nab Paclitaxel follow 5-fluorouracil , epirubicin cyclophosphamide ( FEC ) [ 16 . ] An anthracycline contain regimen follow conventional paclitaxel amongst commonly prescribe adjuvant chemotherapy regime early breast cancer . Cyclophosphamide give combination doxorubicin epimer epirubicin . Epirubicin achieve similar efficacy result doxorubicin cause less cardiotoxicity [ 17 19 ] . Although standard care vary , adjuvant chemotherapy 2011 generally recommended woman triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) HER amplify tumor . In woman hormone receptor positive tumor without HER2 amplification , chemotherapy reserve tumor large extensive nodal involvement and/ high risk biology . The latter include young age , presence lymphovascular space invasion , high proliferative index ( Ki67 expression ) , low ER/PR expression , high Oncotype Dx score luminal B tumor [ 20 ] . Thus evolve trend tailor therapy base tumor characteristic indicate perceive risk , patient factor , particularly comorbid illness patient preference well prediction response . In breast cancer , immunohistochemical assessment proportion cell stain nuclear antigen Ki67 become widely use method compare proliferation tumour sample [ 21 ] . Potential us include prognosis , prediction relative responsiveness resistance chemotherapy endocrine therapy , estimation residual risk patient standard therapy dynamic biomarker treatment efficacy sample take , , neoadjuvant therapy [ 21 , 22 ] . Ki67 label Index incorporate one mean identify tumor subtypes 2011 St Gallen International Expert Consensus Primary Therapy Early Breast Cancer [ 20 ] . Analysis gene expression array result recognition several fundamentally different subtypes breast cancer [ 23 ] . Using gene expression profile distinction make luminal A luminal B tumor . While subtypes could ER positive luminal A tumour unlikely benefit cytotoxic chemotherapy . Because always feasible obtain gene expression array information , simplify classification , closely follow propose Cheang et al whereby cutpoint Ki67 label index &lt; 15 % establish comparison PAM50 intrinsic subtyping differentiate luminal A luminal B tumours [ 24 ] . Local quality control Ki67 stain important [ 20 ] . The Oncotype Recurrence Score validate 21-gene assay offer commercial reference laboratory test ( Oncotype DX , Genomic Health Inc. Redwood City , CA ) . The 21-gene panel include gene involve tumour cell proliferation hormonal response , characteristic report associated chemotherapy response general . Oncotype DX quantifies likelihood breast cancer recurrence woman node-negative , oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer , also predict magnitude chemotherapy benefit [ 21 , 26 ] . Likelihood chemotherapy benefit report low ( Recurrence Score &lt; 18 , intermediate RS 18-30 high &gt; 30 ) . [ 26 ] The main utility Oncotype DX adjuvant setting could powerful tool guide decision regard role cytotoxic chemotherapy hormone positive tumour . In neoadjuvant study employ Oncotype DX guide decision use chemotherapy patient tumours high Ki67 ( &gt; 15 ) low ER expression also group may low Ki67 ( &lt; 15 ) high ER expression IHC . The goal use best combination , sequence duration therapy together predict monitor response high fidelity individual patient . Further study need optimize treatment regimen increase pathologic response rate ultimately survival , goal reduce risk adverse event . This study use tailor approach select treatment involve choice NAB Paclitaxel EC base individual patient tumour characteristic . Breast Cancer Stem Cells It widely accept inability cure cancer largely due presence subset cell within cancer constitutes reservoir self sustain [ 25 ] . Current radiation cytotoxic chemotherapy effectively destroy proliferate cell form bulk tumour , largely ineffective cancer stem cell ( CSC ) [ 26 , 27 ] . Breast cancer first solid malignancy CSCs identify [ 28 ] , via specific cell surface marker proteins CD44 epithelial cell adhesion molecule ( EpCAM ) [ 29 , 30 ] . EpCAM CD44v6 among best available , clinically relevant breast cancer stem cell marker proof principle work project [ 30 ] . Aptamers Aptamers short , singlestranded RNA DNA fold specific 3D structure bind target molecule high affinity specificity [ 31 ] . Unlike antibody , aptamers remain structurally stable across wide range temperature storage condition . They generally nonimmunogenic , nontoxic 20 25 time small monoclonal antibody . Thus aptamers offer several advantage tissue penetration short circulation time faster body clearance result low background noise image low radiation dose . In addition , aptamers produce rapidly , relatively inexpensively , high homogeneity [ 32 , 33 ] . HDACi Histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) play important role gene regulation . Inhibitors HDACs ( HDACi ) novel anticancer drug , induce histone ( hyper ) acetylation counteract aberrant gene repression [ 34 ] . HDACi also evoke nonhistone protein acetylation , alter signal network relevant tumorigenesis agent also promote degradation ( proto ) oncoproteins . Adult stem cell maintain quiescent state able exit quiescence rapidly expand differentiate response stress . The quiescence cancer stem cell ( CSCs ) highly relevant cancer therapy since quiescent CSC often resistant conventional therapy target therapy . The p53 gene play critical role regulate stem cell quiescence [ 35 ] . CSCs promote chemotherapy radiation resistance increase DNA repair capacity histone H3 deacetylation [ 35 ] . Recently role HDACi move latent quiescent cell activate state sensitizing treatment become focus investigation HIV cancer . The HDAC inhibitor study many hematologic solid malignancy little work focus breast cancer particularly CSC [ 36 , 37 ] . A study HDACi quiescent CSCs breast tumour radiation chemotherapy response would great interest develop new therapeutic paradigm use class agent . NAD ( P ) H : quinone oxidoreductase 1 NQO1*2 genotype ( P187S ) Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide , ( NAD+ ) , coenzyme find cell . In metabolism , NAD+ involve reduction oxidation ( redox ) reaction , carry electron one reaction another . The coenzyme find NAD+ , oxidize agent form NADH . This use reduce agent . Electron transfer reaction main function NAD+ . However , also use cellular process , notable one substrate enzymes add remove chemical group proteins , posttranslational modification . There evidence genetic variant oxidative stress relate gene predict resistance chemotherapy primary breast cancer germline polymorphism affect chemotherapy sensitivity patient breastcancer [ 38 ] . The status superoxide dismutases NAD ( P ) H quinone oxidoreductases prognostic significance breast carcinoma [ 39 ] . The NQO1 enzyme guard oxidative stress carcinogenesis stabilize p53 tumor suppressor [ 40 , 41 ] . NQO1 deficient mouse show reduce p53 induction apoptosis . NQO1*2 missense variant ( NP_000894 : p.187P4S ) homozygous 4-20 % human population [ 42 ] . Cells homozygous NQO1*2 genotype measurable NQO1 activity , reflect low level NQO1 P187S protein , undergoes rapid turnover via ubiquitin proteasome pathway [ 43 ] . Response epirubicin impair NQO1*2homozygous breast carcinoma cell vitro , reflect p53linked p53independentroles NQO1 . A potential defective anthracycline response NQO1deficient breast tumor may confer increased genomic instability promote elevate reactive oxygen specie , suggest NQO1 genotype prognostic predictive marker breast cancer . A homozygous common missense variant ( NQO1*2 , rs1800566 ( T ) , NM_000903.2 : c.558C4T ) disable NQO1 strongly show predicts poor survival among two independent series woman breast cancer , effect particularly evident anthracycline base adjuvant chemotherapy epirubicin [ 44 ] . As part study NQO1*2 genotype status patient assess . A correlation explore NQO1*2 genotype status response rate setting . The study evaluate feasibility safety tailor primary systemic therapy study population .</detailed_description>
