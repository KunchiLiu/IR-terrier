	<brief_summary>This research study Phase I clinical trial . Phase I trials test safety investigational drug combination drug . These trial also try define appropriate dose investigational drug use study . `` Investigational '' mean combination drug still study research doctor try find . As part research study , patient administer brentuximab vedotin combination conventional re-induction chemotherapy regimen call MEC , consist chemotherapy drug mitoxantrone , etoposide , cytarabine . Brentuximab vedotin approve FDA patient 's cancer . However , brentuximab target protein tumor call CD30 , approve cancer express CD30 , include Hodgkin lymphoma . This mean FDA approve give brentuximab conjunction MEC use people , include people type malignancy , acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . Mitoxantrone , etoposide cytarabine chemotherapy agent commonly use treat individual relapse AML . Brentuximab antibody-drug conjugate ( ADC ) , combination antibody ( protein bind cell ) drug . Brentuximab vedotin work use antibody portion enter CD30-positive cell release drug portion , attempt destroy cell . Brentuximab vedotin use laboratory research study information study suggest brentuximab vedotin may slow spread cancer express CD30 . Some AML cell express CD30 , investigator hope brentuximab vedotin help type AML . The primary purpose research study determine high dose Brentuximab vedotin safely give MEC without severe unmanageable side effect . The dose identify study use future research study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If patient agree participate research study ask undergo screening test procedure determine eligibility . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn patient take part research study . If patient test procedure recently , may may repeat . These test procedure include : medical history , physical exam , performance status , pregnancy test , urine test , electrocardiogram , echocardiogram , blood test , bone marrow aspirate/biopsy . If test show patient eligible participate research study , begin study treatment . If patient meet eligibility criterion , able participate research study . To start re-induction therapy , patient receive brentuximab vedotin alone Day 1 . They begin treatment MEC ( mitoxantrone , etoposide cytarabine ) day later ( Day 3 ) . Since investigator look high dose brentuximab vedotin safely administer MEC without severe unmanageable side effect AML , everyone participates research study receive dose study drug . The dose patient receives depend number participant enrol study patient well tolerated dos . For study , treatment broken segment . Study treatment occur two segment : 1 ) Re-Induction Therapy ; 2 ) Maintenance Therapy . Re-induction therapy , describe , combination brentuximab vedotin follow day 3 MEC chemotherapy . The maintenance phase therapy include brentuximab vedotin administer every 21 day total period 12 month , include chemotherapy . The treatment assessment may require fo patient phase therapy explain . The following assessment complete patient trial : physical exam , performance status , urine test , blood test bone marrow aspirate/biopsy . The first part study treatment call `` re-induction '' . During re-induction , patient admit Massachusetts General Hospital receive study treatment in-patient basis . Patients receive brentuximab vedotin IV ( intravenously vein ) alone Day 1 . They receive follow standard drug ( MEC regimen ) start day 3 . This regimen include chemotherapy drug mitoxantrone , etoposide , cytarabine , give IV begin Day 3 continue Day 7 . If end re-induction course , number leukemia cell decrease much expect desired , patient remove study give alternative option . The second part study treatment call `` maintenance '' give outpatient basis clinic . During maintenance , patient administer brentuximab vedotin every 21 day , dose give re-induction course . This 21 day period call cycle , repeat 12 month pass start maintenance therapy phase . During phase , participant receive chemotherapy hospitalize treatment . During maintenance phase , investigator continue collect approximately 2 3 teaspoon blood research purpose every 3-4 week . Investigators would like keep track patient ' medical condition overall health follow 12 month treatment study . Investigators may ask patient question general health , current medication disease status . Investigators also check new anticancer therapy patient may start .</detailed_description>
