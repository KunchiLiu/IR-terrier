	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Plus Rituximab ( R ) Non Follicular NHL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Single arm , multicenter , open-label study divide two phase : 1 . Induction phase ; 2 . Follow-up phase . Enrolled patient start induction phase receive course R-Lenalidomide . At end third cycle R-Lenalidomide ( week 12 study ) , patient evaluate tumor response ( complete assessment ) ; patient Progressive Disease ( PD ) withdrawn study . Two week end last course R-Lenalidomide ( week 26 study ) patient evaluate tumor response ( complete assessment ) . Patients Complete Response ( CR ) Partial Response ( PR ) , stable disease undergo follow phase , patient PD withdrawn study .</detailed_description>
