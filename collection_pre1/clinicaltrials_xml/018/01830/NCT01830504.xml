	<brief_summary>In France , 7-8 000 new thyroid cancer case diagnose year . Although good overall prognosis , usually estimate 10 20 % rescue 5 % become metastatic . The standard treatment advance metastatic recurrent thyroid cancer limit radioiodine therapy . It estimate 30 50 % patient become resistant radio iodine . Treatments option limit refractory thyroid patient long term survival estimate less 10 % . Nowadays , drug approve indication . The recent explosion knowledge tumour biology identification potential biological target thyroid cancer lead several clinical trial target therapy , mainly focus TKI inhibitor target MAPkinase pathway and/or VEGF . Preliminary result encourage papillary thyroid tumor . Follicular ( FTC ) poorly differentiate thyroid ( PDTC ) cancer account 10 % thyroid cancer 20-25 % cancer diagnose advanced stage near 50 % metastatic refractory thyroid cancer . These cancer aggressive behavior represent major cause death thyroid cancer . In subtypes , targeted therapy give disappointing result . This may relate mutational profile tumor different papillary cancer . Aberrant activation phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase ( PI3K ) /AKT pathway think play fundamental role thyroid tumorigenenesis follicular poorly differentiate thyroid cancer . Many genetic alteration , recently , identify pathway . PIK3CA mutation find 10-15 % FTC also occur metastasis derive PDTC . Amplification/genomic copy gain PIK3CA identify 24 % FTC 42 % PDTC . Epigenetic inactivation PTEN negatively regulate PI3K show FTC . Moreover , RAS mutation observe 20-40 % FTC PDTC activate PI3K/AKT interact RAS-binding site P110 catalytic subunit PI3K . Due high frequency activation PI3K downstream effector progressive , recurrent poorly differentiate cancer , inhibition PI3K signal pathway BKM120 , potent pan class I PI3K inhibitor , represent particularly relevant therapeutic target properly evaluate advanced follicular poorly differentiate thyroid carcinoma</brief_summary>
