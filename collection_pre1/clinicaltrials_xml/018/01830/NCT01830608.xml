	<brief_summary>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) lead cause blindness Western World . The etiology pathogenesis disease remain largely unknown . In Europe two million people suffer AMD . According Age-Related Eye Disease Study ( AREDS ) disease classify early , intermediate late . Early age-related macular degeneration characterize presence small medium-sized drusen and/or retinal pigmentary abnormality . Intermediate age-related macular degeneration characterize large drusen numerous medium-size drusen and/or geographic atrophy extend center macula . Late age-related macular degeneration either atrophic extension macula neovascular . The late form disease associate pronounced loss visual acuity . In recent year several study focus risk factor late AMD recent systematic review meta-analysis report risk factor AMD base 16 study almost 114000 subject . Strong consistent association late AMD find increase age , current cigarette smoking , previous cataract surgery , family history AMD . Consistent association late AMD high body mass index , history cardiovascular disease , hypertension high plasma fibrinogen also find , association weak . Inconsistent association find gender , ethnicity , diabetes , iris color , history cerebrovascular disease , serum total HDL cholesterol triglyceride level . Evidence also accumulate factor influence risk AMD . Several genetic risk factor identify last year include gene alternative complement pathway RMS2/HTRA1 region . In addition , post-hoc analysis data AREDS study indicate reduced intake omega-3 free fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid docsahexaenoic acid associate risk late AMD thereby support previous population base study . The AREDS study also reveal reduced intake macular pigment lutein zeaxanthin may associate late AMD , support previous population-based study . Finally , 2 small study indicate reduce choroidal blood flow associate increased risk develop late AMD . Less data available progression early intermediate AMD associate risk factor . This least partially related problem quantify progression drusen size volume . In recent year , however , significant effort achieve optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) -based method quantify drusen progression drusen volume . Polarization-sensitive OCT promising approach use quantify drusen area volume present study .</brief_summary>
