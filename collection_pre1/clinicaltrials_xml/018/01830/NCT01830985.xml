	<detailed_description>VX-509 oral , selective Janus kinase 3 ( JAK3 ) inhibitor develop Vertex . In autoimmune disease , JAK3 essential component immune signal cascade . This cascade ultimately contribute abnormal immune response result chronic inflammation , case rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , irreversible damage cartilage bone . Selective inhibition JAK3 offer new disease modify approach treatment RA . This study follow `` treat target '' ( T2T ) paradigm . T2T strategy follow non-rheumatologic field decade . T2T trial conduct RA late 1990 's , substantiate concept treat target associate well outcome standard care treatment . This lead recommendation expert use T2T strategy clinical practice .</detailed_description>
