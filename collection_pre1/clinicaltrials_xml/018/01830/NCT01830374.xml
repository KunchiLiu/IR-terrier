	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine biological ( e.g. , energy expenditure , neuroendocrine appetitive hormone ) behavioral ( e.g. , binge eat purge ) correlate weight suppression current dieting status woman bulimia nervosa . The investigator differentiate diet-induced long-term energy imbalance ( weight suppression , difference one 's highest-ever body weight current weight ) short-term energy imbalance ( current dieting either lose weight avoid weight gain ) .

	<brief_title>Bulimia Nervosa : A Biobehavioral Study ( The Eating Disorder Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bulimia nervosa ( BN ) debilitate psychiatric disorder primarily affect young woman . Empirically support treatment BN identify less half treated individual achieve long-term remission disorder , possibly current treatment approach sufficiently account variable help maintain disorder . Psychosocial model BN emphasize role diet proximal cause binge eat purge . Dieting psychological biological facet exist model BN overwhelmingly focus psychological impact . The investigator differentiate diet-induced long-term energy imbalance ( weight suppression ( WS ) , difference one 's highest-ever body weight current weight ) short-term energy imbalance ( current dieting either lose weight avoid weight gain ) . Recent research show WS level BN elevate degree WS predict severity various BN characteristic clinical course . Studies current dieting ( CD ) lose weight found associate reduced binge eat BN , find conflict prevail model disorder . The propose research examine biological ( e.g. , energy expenditure , neuroendocrine appetitive hormone ) behavioral ( e.g. , binge eat purge ) correlate WS CD BN . ( Relatively BN report diet avoid weight gain biological behavioral correlate also examine . ) The project recruit 132 woman ( 66 Drexel University 66 Columbia University ) meeting provisional Diagnostic Statistical Manual-V diagnostic criterion BN . The investigator test hypotheses 1 ) CD elevate WS associate alteration biological index metabolism appetite , 2 ) WS predict great binge eat purging , CD predict less binge eating , measure use Ecological Momentary Assessment ( EMA ) , 3 ) high real time rating daily food restriction intention predict reduce probability binge eat day increase probability binge eat subsequent day . Assessments participant include : weight report previous high weight ( calculate WS ) , Eating Disorders Examination , 14 day EMA ass food restriction intention , binge eat purge episode , three 24-hr food recall , rest energy expenditure metabolic appetitive hormone ( include complete thyroid panel , leptin , ghrelin , cortisol estradiol ) . Participants ask return 6 month later follow-up assessment weight . This study elucidate two common yet largely unexplored type diet influence biological behavioral variable patient BN , could lead modification prevail model BN new strategy improve treatment outcome .</detailed_description>
