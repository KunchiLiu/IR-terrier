	<detailed_description>Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia ( BPH ) describe common medical condition men 45 associate voiding ( obstructive ) storage ( irritative ) low urinary tract symptom part relate prostate enlargement obstruction [ 1 ] . The standard medical therapy condition include 5-alpha reductase inhibitor -5ARI ( eg dutasteride ) alpha blocker therapy ( eg tamsulosin ) , effective medical therapy BPH combination two medication [ 2 ] . Approximately 10 20 % patient diagnose BPH also either diagnosis symptom chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome ( CP/CPPS ) typical genito-urinary pain discomfort [ 3,4,5 ] . This particular subset patient BPH patient prostatitis symptom pose therapeutic dilemma [ 6 ] . CP/CPPS ( organ specific phenotype ) third prevalent prostate disease prostate cancer BPH . CP/CPPS prevalent ( 3-9 % men ) [ 7,8 ] represent significant percentage urology outpatient ( 3-8 % male outpatient visit ) [ 9,10 ] result major impact quality life patient [ 11 ] economic cost society [ 12 ] . There good evidence base therapy CP/CPPS [ 13,14 ] , although evidence available consider 5 alpha reductase inhibitor alpha blocker therapy [ 22 ] . There enormous unmet need evaluate potential therapy condition . Our current understanding CP/CPPS patient heterogeneous group unique patient ( `` snow flake '' hypothesis ) present different clinical phenotype [ 15 ] . We propose [ 16,17 ] , validate [ 18 ] recently prove clinical phenotyping ( use UPOINT classification system ) possible provide effective treatment strategy [ 19 ] . There study suggest medical therapy proven effective treatment BPH would also beneficial prostatitis like symptom well . A number small pilot study finasteride [ 20 ] , include contemporary 6 month RCT [ 21 ] , strongly suggest 5 ARI therapy may effective patient CP/CPPS , study limit study design include inclusion patient diagnosis CP/CPPS ( age clinical phenotype know could possibly benefit 5ARI ) . REDUCE many epidemiology study , document men 45 year old suffer prostatitis prostatitis symptom [ 23 ] . REDUCE also clearly show dutasteride favorably impact prostatitis-like symptom men prostatitis-like syndrome enrol study [ 24 ] . In fact , potential benefit suggest extrapolate REDUCE result far outweigh intervention evaluate large North American NIH sponsor RCTs last decade [ 25,26,27 ] . A sub-analyses REDUCE show men IPSS â‰¥ 8 enlarge prostate ( eg BPH ) significant symptom benefit dutasteride , irregardless prostate size [ 28 ] .These initial finding REDUCE patient specifically diagnose CP/CPPS expand examine benefit CP/CPPS population . There clinical trial evaluate alpha blocker therapy CP/CPPS [ 22 , 29 ] . While two North American RCTs [ 25,26 ] show benefit , 6 alpha blocker randomize placebo control trial use validated contemporary outcome positive term measureable benefit [ 30-35 ] . The late clinical trial confirm benefit alpha blocker therapy select CP/CPPS patient ( approximately 50 patient per arm 12 week study ) recently publish [ 35 ] show benefit , primarily LUTS symptom domain . Clinical phenotyping allow prediction patient CP/CPPS likely respond dutasteride tamsulosin ( age , Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms [ LUTS ] prostate relate phenotype [ BPH ] ) . It estimate 30 % men currently diagnose CP/CPPS include men co-existing Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia ( BPH )</detailed_description>
