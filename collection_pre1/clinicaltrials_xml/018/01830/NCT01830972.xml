	<detailed_description>GNE myopathy hereditary inclusion body myopathy ( HIBM ) severe progressive metabolic myopathy cause defect biosynthetic pathway sialic acid ( SA ) . Substrate replacement therapy potential therapeutic strategy base success replace miss SA reduce muscle disease relevant mouse model human disease ( Malicdan et al. , 2009 ) . Successful use SA replacement therapy human believe depend upon provide steady long-term exposure compound extend release form ( Sialic Acid-Extended Release [ SA-ER ] ) , give SA 's short half-life . Following Phase 1 study establish pharmacokinetics SA-ER ongoing Phase 2 study assess pharmacodynamic effect restore sialylation muscle treatment 48 week , Ultragenyx conduct study evaluate long term safety efficacy increase dosed SA-ER combine Sialic Acid-Immediate Release ( SA-IR ) capsule treatment , 36 additional month .</detailed_description>
