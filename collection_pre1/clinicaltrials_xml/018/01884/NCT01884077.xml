	<brief_title>Total v . Reverse Shoulder Replacement : Pain Relief Two Years After Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The shoulder mobile joint human body complex arrangement structure work together provide movement necessary daily life . Great mobility come expense stability . Several bone network soft tissue ( ligament , tendon , muscle ) work together produce shoulder movement . They also interact keep joint place move extreme range motion . BONES The glenohumeral joint ( shoulder joint ) multiaxial , synovial ball socket joint involve articulation shoulder blade head humerus ( upper arm bone ) . This make mobile joint human body . SOFT TISSUE The rotator cuff group muscle tendon act stabilize shoulder . The four muscle rotator cuff half seven scapulohumeral muscle . These tendon become torn follow trauma shoulder occur `` wear tear '' tendon , commonly supraspinatus tendon find acromion . To consider equal candidate implant rotator cuff must grossly intact . ARTHRITIS Glenohumeral ( shoulder ) arthritis common source pain disability affect 20 % old population . Damage cartilage surface glenohumeral joint ( shoulder 's `` ball-and-socket '' structure ) primary cause shoulder arthritis . SHOULDER REPLACEMENTS There two type total shoulder replacement system : conventional Total shoulder Reverse shoulder . The reverse originally develop use patient advanced high loss shoulder function conjunction damage rotator cuff . TOTAL In conventional Total shoulder , arthritic surface ball replace metal ball stem press fit inside arm bone ( humerus ) socket resurface component . REVERSE In Reverse Total shoulder ball locate shoulder blade ( glenoid ) socket locate arm bone ( humerus ) , exactly opposite situation conventional total shoulder . The ball ( glenosphere ) screw bone shoulder blade . The cup ( humeral sock¬et ) fix stem cement inside arm bone ( humerus ) . This configuration provide sta¬bility muscle around shoulder compress ball socket together . STUDY PROCEDURES Randomization either total reverse shoulder replacement Review medical record image related patient 's shoulder arthritis surgery Range motion strength test enrollment two year post op Completion American Shoulder &amp; Elbow Survey WOOD enrollment two year post op There clear clinical indication use total reverse shoulder replacement patient young 70 year old base cuff integrity shoulder function . However , decision use total shoulder implant reverse total shoulder implant patient 70 yrs old end-stage glenohumeral ( shoulder ) arthritis intact rotator cuff base surgeon 's preference . There study compare pain relief two implant patient population . So study randomize 34 patient either total reverse shoulder replacement . These individual must meet clinical criterion candidate either implant . The Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty revolutionize management complex shoulder pain dysfunction due rotator cuff tear arthropathy since FDA approval 2003 . The indication use Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty continue expand early result encourage patient arthritis set massively torn rotator cuff . However , role Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty manage pain secondary osteoarthritis shoulder set intact rotator cuff underlie age-related rotator cuff degeneration clear remain challenge clinical question . This question continue gain significance number patient shoulder arthritis rapidly grow number arthroplasty procedure perform annually . Glenohumeral ( shoulder ) arthritis occur normally smooth joint surface glenoid humeral head damage congenital , metabolic , traumatic , degenerative , vascular , septic aseptic inflammatory factor . The prevalence Glenohumeral arthritis increase age.1-3 Several study evaluate prevalence Glenohumeral arthritis find found 16 % elderly population.4-7 Arthritis shoulder report source severe disability limitation quality life experience it.8 , 9 End stage shoulder arthritis reliably treat shoulder arthroplasty . The shoulder third common joint body replace . The incidence shoulder arthroplasty procedure ( include hemiarthroplasty , total shoulder arthroplasty reverse shoulder arthroplasty ) increase steadily United States.10 In 1998 approximately 19,000 shoulder arthroplasty procedure perform . In 2008 approximately 47,000 shoulder arthroplasty procedure perform . The incidence total shoulder arthroplasty steadily outpace hemiarthroplasty preferred choice management osteoarthritis . The Reverse shoulder arthroplasty approve FDA 2003 since steadily gain popularity . As elderly population continue grow arthroplasty technique evolve , number shoulder arthroplasty perform annually expect continue increase . Total shoulder arthroplasty relies intact function rotator cuff order keep prosthetic head center prosthetic glenoid . Rotator cuff deficiency associate early glenoid component loosen total shoulder arthroplasty result shoulder pain , dysfunction revision arthroplasty surgery.8 , 11 Rotator cuff degeneration also associate advance age.12 The scenario age-associated rotator cuff degeneration conjunction chronic osteoarthritis common clinical presentation . The shoulder chronic osteoarthritis set degenerative atrophic rotator cuff present challenge clinical question . From management standpoint question arise whether patient would best serve total shoulder arthroplasty reverse shoulder arthroplasty . A total shoulder arthroplasty gold standard arthroplasty option require intact functional rotator cuff function properly elderly patient likely rotator cuff degeneration dysfunction . Rotator cuff dysfunction may reveal early undergoing total shoulder arthroplasty range motion improve . Secondary rotator cuff dysfunction total shoulder arthroplasty become increasingly recognize entity clinical challenge.13 Conversely , reverse shoulder arthroplasty require functional rotator cuff note promising result arthroplasty option less predictable outcome less clinical follow-up . Many study publish discuss patient outcome shoulder arthroplasty.8 , 14-17 These study limit small patient population , limited follow-up , heterogeneity patient population surgical indication . No study compare Total Shoulder Arthroplasty Reverse Shoulder Arthroplasty treatment osteoarthritis population older 70 year age . The Shoulder Elbow service Washington University uniquely qualify conduct study type give exceptionally large surgical volume shoulder arthroplasty ( 350 shoulder arthroplasty case perform annually ) , access Ultrasonography imaging study participant robust well-organized research infrastructure execute establish research protocol .</detailed_description>
