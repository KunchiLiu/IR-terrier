	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine whether use genetic test information and/or health coaching patient risk counsel heart disease diabetes affect health behavior health outcomes active-duty Air Force ( ADAF ) , beneficiaries dependent Air Force retiree patient . Total 400 subject enrol . They randomly ( like flip coin ) assign 4 group : 1 ) Standard risk assessment ( SRA ) ; 2 ) SRA plus genetic risk information ( SRA+G ) ; 3 ) SRA plus health coaching ( SRA+HC ) ; 4 ) SRA , genetic risk information , health coaching ( SRA+G+HC ) . Subjects randomize two genetic arm blood collect test investigational coronary heart disease ( CHD ) type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) risk marker . Participants two group include health coaching assign train certified health coach period 6 month . The duration study 12 month 3 person visit ( baseline , 6 month 12 month ) completion survey 6 week 3 month time point .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study examine impact provide genetic CHD T2D risk information , without supportive behavioral intervention , promote risk-reducing behavior improve clinical outcome . In short , use 4-group ( 2X2 ) randomize control trial ( RCT ) design , study determine whether incorporate multiple-marker genetic testing risk counsel CHD T2D , couple health coach intervention lead great change physical fitness , health behavior , risk status clinical outcome active-duty Air Force ( ADAF ) , beneficiaries dependent AF retiree patient ( N=400 ) . The study address follow task objective : 1 . Determine main interactive effect multiple-marker genetic risk information incorporate standard CHD T2D risk counseling ( Standard Risk Assessment , SRA ) establish , structure telephonic health coach intervention health behavior change ( diet , exercise habit , smoke cessation ) 12 month , focus ADAF patient , well beneficiary retiree . 2 . Determine main interactive effect genetic risk information incorporate standard CHD T2D risk counsel telephonic health coach intervention clinical outcome ( fast blood glucose , blood pressure , BMI , LDL , triglyceride , total cholesterol , AF composite fitness score ) 12 month AF cohort . Given lack RCTs effect differ genetic test result , false reassurance genetic determinism , also pursue third , exploratory task objective : 3 . Examine differential effect level CHD T2D genetic risk ( # risk allele ) behavior change ( diet , exercise habit , smoke cessation ) AF fitness score 12 month post baseline . Baseline data collection : After screen informed consent , height weight , SBP , waist circumference , current lab result ( FPG , total cholesterol , triglyceride , LDL , HbA1c , HDL ) current PHA ( physical health assessment ) data fitness score ( active duty personnel ) obtain medical record . Subjects randomize two genetic arm blood collect test investigational CHD T2D risk marker . Randomization take place one following : SRA ; SRA plus genetic risk information ( SRA+G ) ; SRA plus health coaching ( SRA+HC ) ; SRA , genetic risk information , health coaching ( SRA+G+HC ) . Risk Counseling Visit : Within four week baseline visit participant receive risk counseling train provider ( ) clinic site . Health coach intervention : Participants two group include health coaching assign trained health coach period 6 month ( n=200 ) . IHC ( Integrative Health Coaching ) session provide telephone use structure evolve multiple trial clinical program Duke Integrative Medicine . Six week , 3- , 6-month follow-up : At 6 week , 3 month 6 month baseline visit , participant ask complete select survey online . 6month 12 month study visit : 12 month baseline visit , active duty participant complete annual PHA , require annual AF fitness testing ; participant complete study visit 6 12 month weight , waist circumference , BP , fast glucose HbA1c lipid panel re-assessed . Surveys complete prior final 12 month visit well .</detailed_description>
