	<detailed_description>Title : Radiotherapy immunological booster patient metastatic melanoma renal cell carcinoma treat High-dose Interleukin-2 : evaluation biomarkers immunologic therapeutic response Phase : Proof Principle phase II study Study Design : Single center , open-label trial ass immune response potential biomarkers predictive response Study Duration : Total duration : 36 month Enrollment : 20 month Treatment : 5 month per patient Follow-up every three month Primary objective : 1. determine tumor antigen-specific immune response induce treatment 2. prospectively determine predictive/prognostic value pretreatment biological feature identify patient benefit HDIL-2-based therapy Secondary end point : 1 . Toxicity 2 . Response Rate 3 . Overall Survival . Number Subjects : Mini-max two-stage Simon design : • Step 1 : 7 patient enrol If tumor antigen-specific immune response observe least 3 patient : • Step 2 : recruitment additional 12 patient Study Product , Dose , Route , Regimen duration administration : Three daily dose boost radiotherapy ( XRT ) 6-12 Gy least 1 , maximum 5 , metastatic field , administrate day -4 -3 -2 -3 -2 -1 first third cycle IL-2 . The first day administration IL-2 cycle day +1 . Treatment IL-2 ( dose 18 MIU/m2/day 500cc continuous IV infusion 72 hour ) start day +1 administer every 3 week 4 cycle , every 3-4 week 2 cycle . IL-2 withheld refractory hypotension ( hypotension isotropic vasoactive therapy ineffective persists despite specific medical therapy set ) , anuria &gt; 24 hour , respiratory distress , confusion , sustain ventricular tachycardia , sign myocardial ischemia myocarditis , persistant metabolic acidosis , atrial fibrillation document systemic infection . Patients evaluate every 8 week compute tomography determine response , every 3 month completion treatment death ( time disease progression initiation alternative therapy also document ) . Statistical Methodology : A minimax two-stage Simon design employ . A 40 % immune response preclude study , whereas 70 % response rate indicate study would warrant . Using alfa beta error 0.10 , 7 patient enrol first stage , immune response observe least 3 patient study go , additional 12 patient treat . The treatment consider active tumor antigen-specific immune response observe 11 19 patient treat . The analysis perform intention treat population , i.e . patient receive least one cycle therapy .</detailed_description>

At least one tumor lesion accessible bioptic sampling . 4 . Prior line ( maximum 4 ) chemotherapy , immunotherapy biological therapy ( e.g . inhibitor BRaf cKit , Ipilimumab , etc . ) advance disease allow ( patient must finish prior treatment least 4 week first IL2 dose ) ; 5 . Male Female , age &gt; = 18 year . 6 . Life expectancy great 3 month . 7 . ECOG performance status &lt; =1 8 . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte &gt; =3,500/microL absolute neutrophil count &gt; =1,500/microL platelets &gt; = 100,000/microL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; =2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine &lt; 1,2 mg/dl haemoglobin &gt; 9.0 gm/dl ECG echocardiogram within normal institutional limit Pulmonary function test within normal institutional limit ( perform patient lung metastasis history impaired lung function ) 9. contraindication use vasopressor agent 10 . Female participant child bear potential male participant whose partner child bear potential must willing ensure partner use effective contraception study 3 month thereafter 11 . Participant willing able give inform consent participation study . 1 . Patient stage I II melanoma RCC 2 . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy immunotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . 3 . Participation another clinical trial investigational agent within 30 day prior study screen . 4 . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . 5 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition IL2 agent use study . 6 . Any autoimmune disease could exacerbate IL2 7 . A medical illness require chronic treatment corticosteroid immunosuppressive agent 8 . A history significant cardiovascular disease , include myocardial infarction , congestive heart failure , primary cardiac arrhythmia , angina pectoris cerebrovascular accident 9 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 10 . Other know malignant neoplastic disease patient 's medical history diseasefree interval le 5 year ( except previously treat basal cell carcinoma situ carcinoma uterine cervix ) ; 11 . HIVpositivity , whether symptomatic .</criteria>
