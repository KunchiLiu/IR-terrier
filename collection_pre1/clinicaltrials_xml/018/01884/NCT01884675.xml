	<brief_summary>It hypothesise ambrisentan may provide benefit subject inoperable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension ( CTEPH ) , currently prove license treatment option exist . This Phase III , randomize , double-blind placebo control parallel group , 16 week study compare safety efficacy ambrisentan 5 milligram ( mg ) versus placebo subject inoperable CTEPH . The study enrol 160 subject , assure least 72 evaluable subject per treatment arm , base 10 % drop-out rate .</brief_summary>
