	<detailed_description>Project 1 : This project work understand woman affect pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) much often men . This observation true heritable , idiopathic associate form PAH . While male female similar hormone level , certain hormone exist high level gender . For example , estrogen level much high female , thus seem sensible place start look difference may affect disease . In small , early study heritable patient , find difference patient break estrogen compare healthy control subject . Now , want confirm find true much large group patient include idiopathic associate form PAH . We also look see testosterone androgenic hormone somehow protective male . If observation hold true large group patient , may try `` fix '' hormone imbalance mouse model PAH drug therapy , see help improve mouse pulmonary hypertension without bad side effect animal . If animal drug study work , may able try drug patient see work human treatment . Project 2 : Despite major advance understand PAH recent decade , safe , effective tolerable therapy remain elusive . The metabolic syndrome ( central obesity , insulin resistance , high blood pressure hyperlipidemiaâ€”fats blood ) implicate PAH . Treating downstream consequence insulin resistance pulmonary vasculature new approach effective intervention highly mortal disease . This project study role insulin resistance pulmonary arterial hypertension determine therapy treat insulin resistance improve pulmonary arterial hypertension . Project 3 : In Project 3 , work theory PAH treat fix cell-cell junction blood vessel drug call recombinant ACE2 ( angiotensin convert enzyme 2 ) . This approach far worked reverse disease mouse model heritable PAH , need good understand work make sure long term safety animal model start human trial , hopefully within year . Definition : Cell-cell junctions-all organ body structure make cell . Normally , cell ( think balloon fill water ) line right next cell membrane touch . Materials flow one cell next . In PAH patient believe cell lining small artery able line together .</detailed_description>
