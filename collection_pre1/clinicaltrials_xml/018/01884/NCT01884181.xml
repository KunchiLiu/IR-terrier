	<detailed_description>Diffusion magnetic resonance image emerge sensitive , noninvasive tool assess abnormality central nervous system . Applications report many neurological disorder . However , motion-sensitizing diffusion gradient prolong diffusion encoding time , clinical practice could difficult especially patient motor disorder Huntington Disease . Currently exist useful biomarker could reflect either disease progression severity Huntington disease . There grow interest image Huntington disease use diffusion magnetic resonance imaging capability depict micro-environmental change . Unfortunately excessive motor abnormality chorea yield acquisition diffusion magnetic resonance image unfeasible clinical setting . The diffusion MRI compress sense demonstrate reduced motion sensitivity improve susceptibility relate artifact accelerated acquisition . Because reduced acquisition time , diffusion MRI patient Huntington Disease would possible . It therefore expect macromolecule deposition brain patient HD lead detectible change diffusion property . The accelerated diffusion MRI technique use acquire data healthy volunteer patient Huntington disease . The aim study develop optimize novel accelerate diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) technique use advance compressed sense technique . The joint sparsity constraint algorithm implement in-line reconstruction platform diffusion MRI processing . The second aim test efficiency new accelerate diffusion MRI technique phantom healthy human . Finally validate hypothesis new accelerate diffusion MRI technique could produce new biomarker HD , patient Huntington Disease recruit . The diffusion index calculate use accelerated acquisition . The diagnostic performance evaluate data reconstruct without acceleration . The correlation disease severity assess . A risk management report conclude end project execution registration department health . The acceleration diffusion MRI could provide new insight etiology disease . The in-line image reconstruction platform could use pediatric psychiatric patient hold still scanner prolonged period patient movement disorder .</detailed_description>
