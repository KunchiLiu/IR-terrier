	<brief_summary>Spinal cord injury neuropathic pain ( SCI-NP ) common problem , severe , one problematic secondary condition minimally modestly responsive currently available treatment . It usually describe burn stabbing , locate level sensation change normal impair ; person feel legs example experience pain leg . The purpose project investigate use novel visual stimulation treatment ; technique show benefit population chronic pain secondary deafferentation . To accomplish , novel treatment - virtual reality ( VR ) walk - examine . Should treatment show benefit , portable , accessible mean treatment available person SCI transportation health care provider often difficult .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This treatment investigate two-phase project : Phase 1 : Determine efficacy VR treatments home-based approach determine effect VR treatment reversal maladaptive cortical reorganization associate SCI-NP , show population neuropathic pain secondary deafferentation . Phase 2 : Determine effectiveness immediate analgesic effect VR treatment among person tetraplegia paraplegia . The primary outcome variable research severity SCI-NP secondary outcome level pain interference daily activity . In phantom pain literature person amputation , treatment paradigm base visual stimulation , call mirror therapy , proven helpful . These approach involve person view mirror image intact limb produce visual illusion return miss limb , often mark reduction pain follow . Investigations demonstrate approach reduce pain individual change associate reversal functional reorganization somatosensory cortex . There one study neuropathic pain SCI demonstrate good neuropathic pain relief mirror image upper half individual SCI low half body represent rear projection screen generate image walk leg . We collaborate author , develop pilot test virtual walking DVD present via virtual reality goggles enhance first person sense immersion . Results sufficiently encourage cause u seek funding current , broad project</detailed_description>
