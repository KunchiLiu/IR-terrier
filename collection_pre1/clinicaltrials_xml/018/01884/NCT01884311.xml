	<brief_summary>The main objective study determine pharmacokinetics profile Subgam-VF . The secondary objective assess safety Subgam-VF refine dose adjustment coefficient Subgam-VF need subject switch prior intravenous immunoglobulin ( IGIV ) therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) Safety Subgam-VF Primary Immunodeficiency Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase III , multicenter , open-label , non-randomized study . Following screening period , eligible subject commence weekly Subgam-VF treatment ; 16 % subcutaneous IgG product . Subjects receive Subgam-VF 26 week time safety assess . After Week 21 , PK sample commence . Follow-up visit ( one week last Subgam-VF infusion , Week 27 ) . All AEs monitor 28 day last Subgam-VF infusion telephone contact ( Week 30 ) . Subgam-VF administer subcutaneously use infusion pump . Subjects give diary record adverse event data well infusion administer home . In addition telephone follow appropriately qualify site staff member day 3 site administer home administer infusion check adverse reaction include infusion site reaction remind subject document subject study diary .</detailed_description>
