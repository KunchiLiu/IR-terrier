	<detailed_description>Anticipated Impacts Veteran 's Healthcare : Individuals serious mental illness ( SMI ) great physical illness morbidity mortality general population , typically enroll complete health promotion intervention . This pilot study provide preliminary evaluation low-demand physical activity intervention may acceptable Veterans SMI lead improve health medically vulnerable population . Project Background : The relatively high rate morbidity mortality find among individual SMI lead prioritization Mental Health QUERI , group , prevention health promotion addition improve coordination physical health care population . Although promising health promotion intervention develop , intensive none seem successfully address challenge improve reach enrollment minimize attrition . We propose conduct pilot evaluation novel low-demand intervention may acceptable introduction health promotion , Get Moving Get Well ! ( GMGW ) program . Participants current version GMGW describe benefit beyond expect . We believe 12-week GMGW program may effective relatively low-demand intervention promote self-efficacy physical health Veterans SMI increase Veteran behavioral activation . Project Objectives : The objective propose study : ( ) determine effect participation 12-week GMGW program measure behavioral activation ; ( b ) determine effect GMGW measure self-efficacy , physical activity , general physical mental health , mood ; ( c ) determine effect participation class measure intent engage actual engagement intensive physical health program . Project Methods : In order inform future full scale study , complete development 12-week manualized GMGW class , assess acceptability , feasibility time burden , evaluate effect intervention key outcome measure . To achieve aim study , randomly assign 30 participant either GMGW attention control condition . Participants complete baseline measure investigate behavioral activation , self-efficacy , physical activity , physical emotional health , mood , intent engage health promotion activity begin class . These measure repeat end 12-week class , along question investigate acceptability intervention . A chart review investigate actual engagement health promotion intervention . We look emergence trend difference expect direction response pattern within group inform u effect size measure permit power analysis full scale trial . We plan use repeated measure analysis variance , control variable differ significantly intervention control group , test hypothesis GMGW participant great improvement measure end 12-week intervention control participant . Finally , also compare number participant evidence participation new health promotion activity medical record use chi-square test equal proportion .</detailed_description>
