	<detailed_description>In vitro vivo research consistently demonstrate array potential beneficial effect prostanoids immune non-immune circumstance relevant liver allograft . ( 1-3 ) Recent review summarize pharmacologic rationale nonclinical clinical experience support use prostanoids , include prostacyclin analog , reduce early morbidity mortality associate liver transplantation . Prostaglandin-class drug , include prostacyclin analog , could represent important advance toward goal reduce transplant relate morbidity , mortality associate cost provide benefit . Additionally , reduction serum creatinine reduce need post-operative dialysis observe study implication protect kidney nephrotoxic affect immunosuppressant agent , especially early post-operative period . As chemically stable analog prostacyclin ( PGI2 ) , peri-operative intravenous administration Remodulin hypothesize ameliorate prevent reperfusion damage thereby decrease hospitalization time improve clinical outcome liver transplantation , compare placebo control . Remodulin , prostanoid , expect facilitate restoration blood supply revascularized graft , provide well-characterized protective effect class compound liver transplant patient .</detailed_description>
