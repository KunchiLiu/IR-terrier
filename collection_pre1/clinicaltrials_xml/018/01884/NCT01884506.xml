	<brief_summary>A total 75 subject recruit study ( 25 normal weight , 25 overweight , 25 obese ) . In subject blood volume determine use minimally invasive carbon monoxide-rebreathing method ( substudy 1 ) iron absorption measure test meal label stable iron isotope . The effect ascorbic acid iron absorption determine use second labeled test meal ( substudy 2 ) . In addition , inflammation , hepcidin iron status determine . In order study effect body fat content blood volume iron absorption weight height measure , body fat de determine dual energy X-ray absorptiometry .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Effect Body Weight Composition Iron Absorption Blood Volume</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity repeatedly show risk factor iron deficiency . The reason believe reduce iron absorption result increase circulate hepcidin concentration . However , direct interaction body fat mass , iron absorption , inflammation hepcidin study date . Whether low iron absorption obese subject could overcome conventional method increase iron absorption , e.g . addition ascorbic acid whether reduction inflammation could improve absorption unclear . For calculation fractional iron absorption oral dos stable iron isotope estimation blood volume require . Several equation estimate blood volume weight height calculate body surface area volume available , rarely validate use obese subject . The aim describe study therefore : 1 ) determine blood volume use carbon monoxide-rebreathing method large BMI range use value validate exist blood volume equation ; 2 ) measure iron absorption , hepcidin inflammation relation BMI body fat 3 ) ass effect ascorbic acid iron absorption .</detailed_description>
