	<brief_title>Gentamicin Bladder Instillation Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Gillette Lifetime Urology clinic , gentamicin bladder instillation ( GBI ) UTI prophylaxis common practice among neurogenic bladder patient IC . However , previously show , evidence support practice mixed . Potential risk practice include waste cost , waste material , wasted time grow antibiotic resistance . Potential benefit include reduce use systemic antibiotic , reduction symptomatic UTIs few hospitalization febrile UTIs . We seek define evidence practice complete double-blind randomize control trial GBI vs. NS instillation . Such trial would benefit Gillette patient community patient IC worldwide . Recurrent UTIs common among patient IC . These create significant patient morbidity healthcare burden . In desperation , many physician prescribe prophylactic oral intravesical antibiotic . This practice common among Gillette clinic patient . However , benefit unclear risk insignificant . As , practice variation significant . In order well define evidence gentamicin bladder irrigation thus inform clinical practice locally Gillette urology clinic practitioner large pursue follow specific aim : 1 . Compare rate symptomatic urinary tract infection asymptomatic bacteriuria among population Gillette patient IC without gentamicin bladder instillation . 2 .
