	<detailed_description>Gastroschisis congenital malformation abdominal organ protrude abdominal wall defect , lead considerable morbidity mortality infancy . In contrast second class congenital abdominal wall defect , omphalocele , association gastroschisis aneuploidy familial cohort heritability index suggest genetic etiology gastroschisis . Although multiple population cohort based-studies implicate various environmental maternal factor pathogenesis gastroschisis ( e.g . young age , smoke ) , cause mechanisms condition remain relatively unclear . The herniated bowel often accumulate fibrinous cover possibly due inflammation induce amniotic fluid . There usually 25 % great risk intrauterine growth restriction gastroschisis . Although long term intact survival excellent ( exceed 95 % ) , associate morbidity significant include gastrointestinal complication stricture , adhesion , volvulus . Furthermore , know association fetal gastroschisis late gestational intra-uterine fetal demise ( IUFD ) . Late gestation IUFD believe result acute volvulus small bowel resultant bowel necrosis death . Until recently , indication early delivery , however ; mount evidence support delivery earlier gestational age . This support prevailing hypothesis early delivery prevents insult amniotic fluid small bowel . However , hypotheses yet examine well design , adequately power , randomize clinical trial . Consequently , primary objective test hypothesis elective early delivery protect fetal bowel deleterious intrauterine factor late pregnancy . Our secondary objective introduce standardize protocol diagnostic , antepartum , post-natal surgical management infant gastroschisis . To date , four study attempt evaluate effect delivery timing neonatal outcome . In retrospective review 57 case , Huang unable demonstrate association earlier delivery short time surgical repair oral feed . Logge colleague perform randomize control trial delivery 36 week ( early ) versus await spontaneous labor ( later ) . Although study demonstrate trend toward improve outcome earlier group , underpowered especially consider mean gestational age delivery early versus later group differ week 35.8 36.7 week , respectively . In recent report Serra , 13 patient deliver electively 34 week compare historical control . The early delivery group demonstrate short time oral feed closure , along decreased acute late complication . This corroborate similar finding Peiro 6 patient deliver 34 week . In latter , morphology bowel demonstrate evidence inflammation thickening , uniformly see deliver term . As mention early hypothesis improve benefit early delivery yet examine well design , adequately power , randomize clinical trial . The preliminary data underscore need 1 ) adequately power randomize control trial , 2 ) clearly define objective outcome measure , 3 ) standardize evidence-based management protocol attempt control vary practice obstetrician pediatric surgeon , may undoubtedly impact result . Fetal gastroschisis generally diagnose 14 week gestation via ultrasound . The subject identify referral make Texas Children 's Pavilion Women Ultrasound unit , Texas Children 's Fetal Center , Ben Taub Hospital 's Ultrasound unit . The subject population consist patient investigator co-investigators practice . The patient approach principal co-investigators . Informed consent obtain study related procedure do . Risks , benefit , alternative study participation discuss entirety question answer . Standard care presently include delivery 38-39 week cesarean delivery reserve obstetrical indication . The care research protocol include standard care ( mention ) `` late '' group , versus delivery 34 week ( research care ) `` early '' group . Otherwise , remainder care differ regardless allocation arm . The procedure follow : 1 . All patient suspect diagnosis fetal gastroschisis undergo comprehensive ultrasound examination confirm diagnosis . If confirm , part routine clinical care , patient undergo Maternal-Fetal Medicine consultation . After visit , patient approach regard participation trial . 2 . If patient agrees participate meet inclusion criterion , patient enrol study assign `` early '' `` late '' delivery arm . After informed consent , patient assign study arm use conceal envelope , create prior start study use randomization scheme- prepared prior start study non-participating statistician . 3 . Antepartum care similar group except time delivery . This include ultrasound fetal growth evaluation every 3 week weekly fetal biophysical profile ( antenatal fetal well-being testing ) start 32 week . 4 . The early group undergo induction labor 34 week cesarean delivery reserve obstetrical indication two injection celestone ( 12mg/kg ) prior induction . 5 . The late group undergo induction labor 38-39 week cesarean delivery reserve obstetrical indication . 6 . The trial conduct intent-to-treat fashion . With regard postnatal management neonate , neonate evaluate neonatologist pediatric surgeon immediately birth . All neonate , regardless allocation arm , undergo routine care include intubation initiation total parenteral nutrition immediately birth . With respect nutritional care , neonate manage per Texas Children 's Hospital 's neonatal intensive care ( NICU ) feed protocol , consist exclusive human milk . This also applicable Ben Taub General Hospital . Total Parenteral Nutrition ( TPN ) continue total oral intake exceed 100 ml/kg/day . 7 . Two teaspoon ( 10mL ) maternal blood collect store appropriately . With respect surgical care , neonate group simple gastroschisis complicate gastroschisis . The latter consist case complicate perforation intestinal atresia . 1 . In case simple gastroschisis , immediate closure possible , place silo closure within 4 day ( day life 5 ) . 2 . In complicated case intestinal atresia , silo closure undertake within 4 day ( day life 5 ) , neonate return operate room 6 week life resection . 3 . In complicated case perforation , neonates take immediately operate room ostomy and/or bowel ligation closure . The study include follow neonatal pediatric component : 1 . In case , neonatal data collect initial post-delivery stay . This include follow variable : . INITIAL STAY AFTER DELIVERY - length birth discharge - weight birth discharge - head circumference birth discharge , - enteral feeding data parenteral nutrition throughout admission - nutrition relate lab - APGAR score - medications- lasix , chlorothiazide , dopamine , hydrocortisone dexamethasone - morbidity necrotizing enterocolitis , patent ductus arteriosus , spontaneous intestinal perforation , intraventricular hemorrhage , sepsis , chronic lung disease b . 1 MONTH POST DELIVERY - length - weight - head circumference - demographic , socioeconomic , nutritional information c. 6 MONTHS POST DELIVERY - length - weight - head circumference d. 12 MONTHS POST DELIVERY - length - weight - head circumference e. 18 MONTHS POST DELIVERY - length - weight - head circumference - Bayley Scales Infant Development II certify practitioner Subject participation approximately 1 1/2 year .</detailed_description>
