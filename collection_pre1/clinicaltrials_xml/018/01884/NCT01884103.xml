	<brief_summary>Our overall goal propose study describe current prehospital trauma triage process old adult ( ageâ‰¥55 ) patient suspect Traumatic Brain Injury ( TBI ) , identify effect certain medication ( anticoagulant platelet inhibitor ) TBI-related need trauma center service , identify novel TBI screening strategy feasible use prehospital setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Field Triage Older Adults Who Experience Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) major source disability death older adult . Of particular concern old adult frequently sustain TBIs low-mechanism injury , fall stand height , frequently use anticoagulant platelet inhibitor , place risk bad clinical outcome . With growth older adult population expand use anticoagulant platelet inhibitor , TBI among old adult continue major source morbidity mortality unless method identify improve outcome unique population . Building upon long-standing highly successful EMS research laboratory specifically focus triage injured patient prehospital care old patient employ combination qualitative quantitative method , collect data large , multi-county catchment area include multiple EMS agency , urban rural environment , well trauma center non-trauma center . In study , : 1 ) identify candidate neurologic scale maximize detection high-risk older adult TBI patient ; 2 ) characterize current trauma triage process use EMS provider identify old patient suspect TBI patient take anticoagulant and/or platelet inhibitor ; 3 ) assess public health burden TBI among old adult EMS patient take anticoagulant and/or platelet inhibitor ; 4 ) ass predictive ability novel prehospital-based neurologic screening strategy identify high-risk old adult TBI patient prehospital set require TBI-related trauma center care . Findings study potential shift clinical practice prehospital set informing future recommendation identification TBI among old adult take anticoagulant platelet inhibitor .</detailed_description>
