	<brief_summary>Central nervous system ( CNS ) malignancies second common malignancy common solid tumor childhood , include adolescence . Annually United States , approximately 2,200 child diagnose CNS malignancy rate appear increase . CNS tumor lead cause death solid tumor child . Survival duration diagnosis child highly variable depend part age diagnosis , location tumor , extent resection ; however , child high grade glioma die within 3 year diagnosis . All patient high grade glioma experience recurrence first-line therapy , improvement first-line salvage therapy critical enhance quality-of-life prolonging survival . It unknown currently use intravenous ( IV ) therapy even cross blood brain barrier ( BBB ) . We show previous phase I trials single Superselective Intra-arterial Cerebral Infusion ( SIACI ) Cetuximab and/or Bevacizumab safe treatment recurrent glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) adult , currently evaluate efficacy treatment . Therefore , phase I/II clinical research trial extension trial seek test hypothesis intra-arterial Cetuximab Bevacizumab safe effective treatment relapsed/refractory glioma patient &lt; 22 year age . We expect project provide important information regard utility SIACI Cetuximab Bevacizumab therapy malignant glioma patient &lt; 22 year age may alter way drug deliver patient near future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraarterial Infusion Of Erbitux Bevacizumab For Relapsed/Refractory Intracranial Glioma In Patients Under 22</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The experimental aspect treatment plan include : 1 . Subjects first treat Mannitol prior chemotherapy infusion ( Mannitol 25 % ; 10 mL 2 minute ) order disrupt blood brain barrier . This technique use several thousand patient previous study IA delivery chemotherapy malignant glioma . We use without complication patient Phase I protocols well . 2 . To treat patient &lt; 22 year age recur relapse glioma single intraarterial delivery ( SIACI ) Cetuximab Bevacizumab . Our Phase I trials demonstrate safety SIACI delivery drug adult . This trial focus safety efficacy patient &lt; 22 year age .</detailed_description>
