	<brief_title>Sedation Versus General Anesthesia Endovascular Therapy Acute Stroke - Impact Neurological Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke common cause neurological disability . Early diagnosis ischemic stroke enables treatment thrombolysis / endovascular therapy ( embolectomy ) . In order implement procedure , duration varies 2-6 hour , patient remain immobilized . Two technique currently use routinely achieve . One technique general anaesthesia , ensure patient completely immobile throughout procedure , advantage neuroimaging perspective . A disadvantage preparation , induction anesthesia prolongs time embolectomy . Another disadvantage may patient´s blood pressure drop anesthesia , could impair brain blood supply subsequently neurological outcome . The ability evaluate patient 's neurological symptom also disappear . The second technique consist sedation surgery . The advantage technique time begin embolectomy get short blood pressure become stable . One drawback guarantee patient remain immobile throughout procedure , increase risk motion artifact may lead duration embolectomy becomes prolong . There also risk hypoventilation patient aspirate surgery . Retrospective study suggest patient receive general anesthesia bad neurologic outcome three month stroke . This could explain less pronounced anesthesia-induced episode hypotension , compare lightly sedate patient stable blood pressure . In retrospective analyzes , however , patient receive general anesthesia , neurologically speak , ill patient receive sedation . This may probably , least part , explain anesthetized patient bad neurologic outcome . In retrospective study , many center involve , various endovascular anesthesia procedure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients acute stroke consider thrombectomy meeting follow inclusion criterion include : 1. patient ≥ 18 year 2. patient CT angio verify embolization * / NIHSS score ** ≥ 10 ( R ) 14 ( L ) depend side engagement 3. embolectomy ( = groin puncture ) start &lt; 8 hour symptom onset Embolus one follow artery : internal carotid artery , anterior cerebral ( A1 segment ) , cerebri medium ( M1 segment ) proximal cerebri medium branch ( M2 segment ) . NIHSS ( National Institutes Health Stroke Scale ) . Patients embolus leave hemisphere circulation require ≥ 14 point , patient embolus right hemisphere circulation require ≥ 10 point . This occlusion right side usually cause aphasia , symptom usually lead high total score NIHSS . 1. patient must receive general anesthesia , medical reason , accord responsible anesthesiologist 2. patient receive general anesthesia , medical reason , accord responsible anesthesiologist 3. patient embolization posterior brain vessel 4 . CTconfirmed intracerebral hemorrhage 5. spontaneous recanalization spontaneous neurological improvement 6. reason allow embolectomy ( comorbidities ) 7. premorbid MRS ≥ 4</criteria>
