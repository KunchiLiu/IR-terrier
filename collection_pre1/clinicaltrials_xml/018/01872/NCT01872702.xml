	<brief_summary>The overall aim study two fold : 1. pilot target chemo-elimination plasmodium falciparum malaria know area artemisinin resistance South East Asia . 2. understand micro-epidemiology malaria area ; chiefly , prevalence importance on-going transmission sub-clinical p.f malaria infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Targeted Chemo-elimination ( TCE ) Malaria</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The spread artemisinin resistance Plasmodium falciparum , compromise therapeutic efficacy artemisinin combination treatment ( ACTs ) , great threat current global initiative control eliminate malaria consider high priority WHO Global Malaria Programme . If eliminate , resistant parasite could spread across Asia Africa , happen resistance antimalarial past . Conventional description epidemiology malaria low transmission setting suggest malaria prevalence low ( &lt; 10 % ) heterogeneous . Most infection think symptomatic focus malaria control activity identification treatment symptomatic individual . We others show recently artemisinin resistant P. falciparum prevalent Western Cambodia , also find along Thailand-Myanmar border Vietnam . We recently develop highly sensitive quantitative PCR ( qPCR ) method parasite detection use &gt; 1mL blood 5,000 time sensitive conventional microscopy , 100 time sensitive currently use PCR . We study village along Thai-Myanmar border typical region classify conventional epidemiological technique low-transmission ( 5-20 % malaria prevalence ) . Our study suggest majority population infect . In Pailin , Western Cambodia , area National Malaria Control Programme WHO believe malaria eliminate , also find high rate ( &gt; 80 % ) sub-microscopic parasitaemia patient fever history fever RDT negative . Thus , lot asymptomatic malaria low transmission setting previously think , suggest control elimination activity need rethought . This study design conduct evaluate efficacy pilot implementation target chemo-elimination select area goal eliminate malaria region . This differ mass drug administration ( MDA ) ; strategy use identify specific area mass treatment necessary , case eliminate malaria parasite . Elimination target community significant level subclinical infection transmission identifiable future compare rate positivity RDT microscopy new population sample qPCR data , show true falciparum prevalence . The study assess feasibility , safety acceptability strategy impact transmission malaria progression artemisinin resistance . In addition evaluate contribution low parasitaemia carriage transmission artemisinin resistant malaria . These pilot study necessary prelude future scale policy implementation . Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DP ) highly efficacious inexpensive ACT well tolerate age group use treat uncomplicated multi-drug resistant falciparum malaria South East Asia . Monthly DP treatment prove highly effective well tolerate . When used part MDA strategy , addition gametocytocidal drug contributes towards goal malaria elimination add strong transmission block activity regimen . Primaquine ( PQ ) , currently license 8-aminoquinoline , relatively safe effective use dose 0.25 mg base/kg , require G6PD screening . Thus , propose evaluate potential strategy eliminatie malaria focally area artemisinin resistance P. falciparum prevalent use DP plus PQ .</detailed_description>
