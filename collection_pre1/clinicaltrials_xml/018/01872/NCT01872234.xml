	<brief_summary>The purpose trial study determine pacemaker therapy beneficial alternative conventional medical therapy patient history moderate heart failure . The investigator look enroll approximately 180 people trial . Patients randomize two group . One group implant pacemaker continue receive conventional medical therapy prescribe doctor . The second group continue receive conventional medical therapy prescribe doctor implant pacemaker . Clinical history , physical exam , external device test collected time enrollment trial follow-up study visit . Patients enter study see study visit 1 month , 3 6 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MADIT ASIA Cardiac Resynchronization Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>MADIT-ASIA multicenter , prospective , randomized clinical study . The primary aim show two lead CRT-P guideline-based optimal pharmacological therapy associate significantly great improvement leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) 6 month compare guideline-based optimal pharmacologic therapy . The study initially conduct approximately 25 center 9 country Asia include India , Thailand , Taiwan , Malaysia , China , Japan , South Korea Singapore . If necessary , site may invite participate meet enrollment goal . Following randomization , subject schedule clinic visit follow-ups 1 , 3 6-month interval . Relevant event history , cardiac medication , physical assessment , device interrogation/programming status adverse event collect follow-up visit . At 6-month visit , repeat echocardiogram 12-lead ECG obtain . Subjects follow 6 month visit . After , subject safety follow contact end study . The study end last randomized subject reach 6 month visit .</detailed_description>
