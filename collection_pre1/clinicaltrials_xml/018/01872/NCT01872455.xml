	<brief_title>Diet Rich N-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Renal Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An emerge concept clinical nutrition dietary intervention may improve course systemic inflammatory disorder like rheumatoid arthritis psoriasis . Most effect depend ability polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFAs ) modulate immune inflammatory response . Two main family PUFAs exist human tissue : n-3 PUFAs mark anti-inflammatory activity n-6 PUFAs , conversely , promote inflammation . Multiple mechanisms account modulation inflammatory response PUFAs . Recent lipidemic study add new mediator like lipoxins list PUFA metabolite control inflammation classically include pro-inflammatory anti-inflammatory prostaglandin like PGE2 PGE3 , respectively . The concerted activity mediator may determine decreased recruitment inflammatory cell target tissue , low release pro-inflammatory cytokine like Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) necrosis tumor factor-α ( TNF ) , high apoptosis rate . n-3 PUFAs include α-linolenic acid ( ALA ) , eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , whereas linoleic acid ( LA ) arachidonic acid ( AA ) main n-6 PUFAs . ALA LA essential fatty acid synthetized human body assume diet . They precursors downstream immunomodulatory long-chain fatty acid : LA convert AA mark pro-inflammatory activity transform pro-inflammatory eicosanoids ( PGE2 ) leukotrienes . On contrary , ALA convert EPA DHA , precursor anti-inflammatory prostaglandin ( PGE3 ) inhibit production AA synthesis thromboxane . Importantly , amount ALA convert EPA DHA human usually low make also fatty acid essential . The current western diet poor n-3 PUFAs suggest n-3 PUFAs-dependent endogenous anti-inflammatory mechanism could potentiate simultaneously increase n-3 PUFA intake lower n-6/n-3 ratio . Indeed , high n-6/n-3 ratio associate bad clinical course cardiovascular , inflammatory autoimmune disease . With rationale increase n-3 PUFAs intake lower n-6/n-3 ratio , n-3 PUFAs supplementation like fish oil give favorable clinical result patient affected different chronic inflammatory disease include rheumatoid arthritis , inflammatory bowel disease , psoriasis . Fish oil , however , low palatability may cause low patient ' compliance prolong therapy . Since seafood , several fruit vegetable high content n-3 PUFAs , dietary regimen base specific food expect increase n-3 PUFAs intake. , thus represent attractive alternative administration exogenous fish oil product therapeutic program aim exploit beneficial n-3 PUFAs effect systemic inflammatory disorder . Therefore , investigator explore effect diet base food high n-3 low n-6 PUFAs content long-term kidney transplant recipient . These patient could benefit increase n-3 PUFAs intake persistent systemic inflammatory status occur kidney transplantation , greatly contribute development cardiovascular disease chronic allograft dysfunction . Previous study show dietary administration n-3 increase graft survival different animal model organ transplantation , whereas n-6 PUFAs opposite effect . Recently , efficacy n-3 PUFAs supplementation canola oil decrease systemic inflammation lower incidence rejection demonstrate also human .</detailed_description>
