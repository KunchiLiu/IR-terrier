	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety efficacy novel , tissue-engineered vascular prosthesis , Human Acellular Vascular Graft , HAVG . The HAVG intend alternative synthetic material autologous graft creation above-knee femoro-popliteal bypass graft patient peripheral arterial disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Safety Efficacy Vascular Prosthesis Above-Knee Bypass Graft Patients With PAD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The HAVG sterile , non-pyrogenic , acellular tubular graft compose human collagen natural extra-cellular matrix protein . Upon implantation , anticipate ( base pre-clinical study ) collagen-based matrix comprise graft infiltrate host cell re-modeled host . This result vascular structure similar histological composition native vascular tissue may improve graft longevity less likely become infect .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients symptomatic peripheral arterial disease require knee femoropopliteal bypass surgery Claudication distance 200 less rest pain critical limb ischemia Preoperative angiography angioCT show superficial femoral artery occlusion &gt; 10 cm AND graft length require ≤ 30 cm . This imaging may conduct 3 month prior study entry provide patient 's symptom remain stable since time Preoperative imaging show least two knee vessel patent ankle good runoff Femoral artery occlusion consider suitable endovascular treatment Autologous vein graft suitable feasible e.g . severe venous disease prior use leg vein bypass surgery clinical need preserve vein future bypass surgery coronary peripheral circulation Aged 18 80 year old , inclusive Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dL platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3 prior Day 1 Other hematological biochemical parameter within range consider acceptable administration general anesthesia prior Day 1 Adequate liver function , define serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL ; GGT , AST , ALT , alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2x upper limit normal INR ≤ 1.5 prior Day 1 . Able communicate meaningfully investigative staff , competent give write informed consent , able comply entire study procedure Able willing give inform consent Life expectancy least 2 year History evidence severe cardiac disease ( NYHA Functional Class III IV ) , myocardial infarction within six month prior study entry ( Day 1 ) , ventricular tachyarrhythmias require continue treatment , unstable angina Acute injury active infection ( include positive culture pathogenic bacteria ) limb receive graft Stroke within six ( 6 ) month prior study entry ( Day 1 ) Treatment investigational drug device within 60 day prior study entry ( Day 1 ) Women child bear potential Active diagnosis cancer within previous year Immunodeficiency include AIDS / HIV Documented hypercoagulable state history 2 DVTs spontaneous intravascular thrombotic event Bleeding diathesis Ongoing treatment vitamin K antagonists direct thrombin inhibitor factor Xa inhibitor ( e.g . dabigatran , apixaban rivaroxaban ) Previous arterial bypass surgery ( autologous vein synthetic graft ) operative limb Previous angioplasty stenting operative limb unless graft anastomosis make least 1cm distant site stent Stenosis &gt; 50 % external iliac artery unless plan treat stenosis angioplasty without stenting prior , time , graft implantation Distal graft anastomosis likely knee Active autoimmune disease symptomatic require ongoing drug therapy Active local systemic infection ( WBC &gt; 15,000/mm3 ) Known serious allergy aspirin penicillin Any condition judgment investigator would preclude adequate evaluation safety efficacy HAVG Previous enrollment study Employees sponsor patient employee relative investigator</criteria>
