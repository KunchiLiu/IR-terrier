	<brief_summary>The main goal project help 9-1-1 emergency medical dispatcher save life cardiac arrest victim . The investigator develop teaching tool help dispatcher recognize abnormal breathing may indicate victim cardiac arrest . After train session , investigator see dispatcher get well recognize abnormal breathing , often give CPR instruction , use teach tool increase bystander CPR number victim leave hospital alive .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cardiac arrest lead cause death Canada ; define sudden cessation cardiac mechanical activity . It uniformly fatal treat within minute . More 85 % out-of-hospital cardiac arrest ( OOHCA ) occur residential location public access automatic external defibrillator , restart heart , helpful . The overall rate survival OOHCA rarely exceed 8 % . Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) chest compression ventilation provide someone emergency response team . A victim cardiac arrest almost 4 time likely survive receive bystander CPR . However , despite various attempt improve bystander rate remain low , exceed 15 % Ontario . It show since ambulance dispatch centre Ontario implement dispatch-assisted CPR instruction ( give caller emergency vehicle way ) , significant increase use . Emergency medical dispatcher identify 70 % OOHCA case phone . Agonal breathing ( laboured breathing precede death ) may misinterpret sign life , responsible much 50 % missed diagnosis . There specific training significance sign , minimal information recognize cardiac arrest . An educational intervention design well understand significance agonal breathing clarify exist CPR instruction protocol likely increase frequency CPR instruction , bystander CPR rate , potentially survival victim cardiac arrest .</detailed_description>
