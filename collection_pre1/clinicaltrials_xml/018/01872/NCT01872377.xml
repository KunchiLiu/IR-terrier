	<brief_summary>Currently standard treatment locally advance , unresectable pancreatic cancer consist either chemotherapy combination chemotherapy plus radiation therapy treatment . Unfortunately , treatment thus far able provide patient consistent chance cure although rare patient live many year treatment . For patient chemotherapy chemotherapy plus radiation maintain improve quality life keep cancer control period time . Approximately 25-30 % patient early pancreatic cancer able cancer completely remove surgically live beyond 5 year consider cure . This tell u aggressive treatment direct tumour pancreas lead cure . For majority patient operation , give radiation part treatment may strategy result well control tumour pancreas may may result patient live longer . The purpose study test safety add high dose ( `` boost '' dose ) radiation use radiation unit call CyberKnife combine standard chemotherapy radiation patient locally advance , unresectable pancreatic cancer . Participants study receive 'boost ' dose radiation consist 3 treatment 1 week . The participant receive standard care treatment chemotherapy standard radiation therapy 5 week period , follow conventional 20 week chemotherapy alone . The participant follow progression disease toxicity relate boost treatment 5 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) minimally invasive treatment technique allow ultra-high dos radiation deliver small area precision previously possible use old equipment . The CyberKnife® Robotic Radiosurgery System ( Accuray , Sunnyvale California , USA ) radiation unit specifically design focus beam radiation accurately anywhere body . It able track , detect correct tumor movement treatment use sophisticated image guidance system .</detailed_description>
