	<brief_title>Effects Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Treatment Phantom Limb Pain Landmine Victims : ANTARES</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background In 2007 Colombia one five country world high number anti-personnel landmine victim [ 1 ] . These small device design injure kill people animal explode minimum pressure exert ( approximately 6 Force-Kg ) [ 2 ] . Between 1999 2008 6696 report incident artifact Colombia , partly due intensify civil war conflict period time , however , estimate number affected subject might high due underreporting [ 1 ] . This problem enormous impact Public Health Colombia , aggravate fact victim , often child young adult , frequently suffer significant degree physical psychological disability , lead increase number healthy life year ( DALYs ) lose population , together important secondary economic impact [ 1-5 ] . Anderson et al [ 3 ] estimate quality life affect 25 87 % family relative victim landmine . Among multiple physical psychological disability sequel derive landmines [ 6-8 ] , one important consequence chronic neuropathic pain secondary amputation . Ketz conduct retrospective study among 30 soldier wound combat , find prevalence 77 % Phantom Limb Pain ( PLP ) traumatic amputation [ 9 ] . The factor associate development neuropathic pain patient include central peripheral phenomenon [ 10-12 ] . The direct damage involve tissue produce inflammation , case infection induce release several molecule , hydrogen , potassium arachidonic acid , turn , activate sensitize pain receptor , lead exaggerated response minimal painful stimulus [ 11 ] . Another propose mechanism development PLP fact damage peripheral nerve tissue grow so-called `` neuroma '' [ 13 , 14 ] . These show express great density sodium channel cell membrane , increase activity peripheral nociceptors [ 15 ] . This increased activity lead change synaptic structure neuron locate dorsal horn spinal cord , increase excitability well reduce frequency intensity inhibitory process [ 11 , 16 ] . Besides spinal peripheral change , encephalic alteration also find [ 17-24 ] . Melzack introduce neuromatrix theory , suggest pain multidimensional experience , involve large neural network enables integration simultaneous processing information multiple peripheral receptor process information permanently neural circuit , emphasize importance central structure aspect pain [ 25 ] . In addition , Merzenich et al [ 26 ] conduct study adult monkey , find amputation limb , primary somatosensory cortex seem rearrange cortical area represent amputate limb . The high prevalence PLP amputation lead major effort order lessen pain affected patient . However , result use conventional medical treatment , include opiate , N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonists surgery , poor , general efficacy rate 30 % , statistically good placebo [ 20 , 27-33 ] . Recently , propose repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) effective alternative treatment neuropathic pain [ 34 ] . The rTMS non-invasive stimulation technique human brain generates small magnetic field high intensity brief electrical current generate magnetic coil place head individual [ 35 , 36 ] . The electric current induced cerebral cortex run parallel plane plane stimulation , way stimulation affect mainly brain element cerebral cortex activate pyramidal cell transinaptically ( 37 ) . The use high frequency rTMS ( &gt; 1Hz ) raise blood flow stimulate area , induce increased brain activity . On hand , low-frequency stimulation ( &lt; 1 Hz ) reduce brain activity [ 38 , 39 ] . In addition vascular change , rTMS may induce modification several hormonal ax even production neurotransmitter , dopamine serotonin , arginine , NMDA , taurine aspartate [ 40-43 ] . Additionally find rTMS may regulate expression gene include c-fos c-jun , vital structural component activator protein 1 , special transcription factor help regulate cellular process include differentiation , proliferation apoptosis . The rTMS also help modulate peptide biosynthetic pathway , brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) glial fibrillary acidic protein ( GFAP ) , important molecule neuronal plasticity process [ 42-44 ] . Using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) , Li et al [ 45 ] , observe stimulation 1Hz rTMS leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex induce immediate increase local blood flow , follow perfusion bilateral middle prefrontal cortex , right orbital frontal cortex , leave hippocampus , middorsal nucleus thalamus , bilateral putamen , pulvinar insula . These previous observation suggest addition produce local change stimulate cerebral cortex , rTMS might also influence activity cortical sub-cortical region different brain circuit connection [ 46 , 47 ] . Reported side effect rTMS minor event , mainly related cephalagia , change stimulation threshold hearing , tinnitus , local erythema , syncopal episode case mild transient cognitive disorder related area stimulate [ 48-51 ] . The important complication describe possible induction seizure ( &lt; 0.1 % ) ; however seizures associated sequel development epilepsy [ 52-54 ] . There medical non-medical contraindication use , , presence metal endo-cranial , cardiac pacemaker hearing , well cardiac arrhythmia , intracranial hypertension , use medication low seizure threshold personal family history epilepsy [ 55 ] . The rTMS first use small group patient suffer chronic neuropathic pain secondary trigeminal neuralgia brachial plexus injury [ 56-58 ] . Lefaucheur et al [ 56 ] conduct study 18 patient average age 54 year , present chronic neuropathic pain one hand , resistant drug treatment . The patient randomize three twenty minute session rTMS , one low frequency ( 0.5 Hz ) magnetic stimulation , high frequency ( 10 Hz ) sham coil evaluate placebo effect . The level pain session evaluate use Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) . In study determine patient undergo 10-Hz rTMS perceive significant reduction pain compare subject receive stimulation 0.5 Hz rTMS receive placebo treatment . Subsequently , Lefaucheur et al [ 57 ] replicate result group 60 patient neuropathic pain secondary thalamic infarction , brachial plexus injury trigeminal nerve injury , underwent two session high frequency rTMS separate three week , conclude 65 % patient report improvement symptom . The author conduct study include 36 patient neuropathic pain secondary either brachial plexus trigeminal nerve injury . All receive high frequency rTMS . The first one two session latter receive three session . As previous study level pain evaluate , session one week , use VAS . The best response pain obtain second fourth day initial treatment improvement maintain period seven day [ 59 ] .
