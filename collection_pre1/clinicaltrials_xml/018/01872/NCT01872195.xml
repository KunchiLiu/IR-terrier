	<detailed_description>1.0 Background Surgical procedure high risk event patient may suffer complication die post operatively . A report on-going patient safety campaign `` In Safe Hands '' lead Norwegian Knowledge Centre Health Services reveal approximately 16 % Norwegian hospital admission 2010 involved adverse event ( AE ) ( Deilkås , 2011 ) . A review study AEs 2008 include wide range in-hospital patient Australia , Canada , New Zealand , United Kingdom , United States America ( US ) ( de Vries et al. , 2008 ) . 9 % patient experienced AE , 7 . 4 % end fatally . The majority AEs occur surgical treatment relate drug administration . The author claim almost half could prevent checklist cover entire surgical pathway use ( de Vries et al. , 2008 ) . Implementation system , call Surgical Patient Safety System ( SURPASS ) fact result reduction in-hospital morbidity ( 27.3 % 16.7 % ) mortality ( 1.5 % 0.8 % ) ( de Vries , 2010 ) . Patient safety checklist introduce recommended standard surgical care ( Birkmeyer , 2010 ; de Vries et al. , 2011 ) . Studies base data electronic patient administrative system show checklist use may reduce mortality morbidity surgery ( de Vries et al. , 2010 ; van Klei et al. , 2012 ; Haynes et al. , 2009 ) . Safe Surgery checklist recommend World Health Organization ( WHO ) since 2008 strategy avoid adverse event ( AE ) surgery . More 6000 hospital implement Safe Surgery checklists operate theatre ( OTs ) ( http : //www.who.int/patientsafety/safesurgery/en/ ) , include Haukeland University Hospital ( HUH ) . This multicentre research project also introduce system patient safety checklist point care surgical patient ' stay , operate theatre ( OTs ) . The system combine new checklist patient care ( part SURPASS ) already establish Safe Surgery checklist ( WHO ) OTs . At time secure reliability , validity quality patient , morbidity mortality data essential part study . Today discharge physician review medical journal make medical summary include cod disease complication relevant current admission . International Classification Diseases ( ICD-10 ) code use set diagnosis clinical , epidemiological quality purpose ( http : //www.who.int/classifications/icd/ICD10Volume2_en_2010.pdf ) . The ICD-10 code also use registration national mortality morbidity Norwegian National Patient Register ( NPR ) . Questions raise accuracy quality data register Norway , e.g . patient sepsis ( Flaatten , 2004 ) , intensive care patient ( Aardal et al. , 2005 ) . In Danish study relation ICD-10 cod National Registry Patients hospital ' discharge summary medical record , high reliability ICD-10 score co-morbidity found ( Thygesen et al. , 2011 ) . To knowledge similar study do Norway . As crucial part investigation concurrently evaluate reliability validity patient administrative data compare post discharge ICD-10 code actual data available directly medical journal system document health care personnel journal text . 2.0 Objective The main objective study : - Perform systematic review publish study effect safety checklist medicine . - Explore effect morbidity mortality implement system patient safety checklist point care surgical patient ' stay ( element SURPASS WHO Safe Surgery list combine ) , cohort surgical patient different surgical department one hospital , patient department system introduce serve control three hospital . - Investigate validity post discharge ICD-10 code complication compare actual information find medical journal system text . 3.0 Methods 3.1 The project design 1 . Systematic review A systematic review effect safety checklist medicine do May 29th , 2012 database MEDLINE , Cochrane library , EMBASE Web Science , limited human . The criteria pre-set include time publish quantitative study language in-hospital pre-hospital setting safety checklist sole intervention , effect use checklist , generate measurable outcome . 7408 singular article find . To ensure transparency review process use PRISMA guideline ( Liberati et al. , 2009 ) . 34 study meet inclusion criterion . The majority include study measure effect pre-and post-intervention classify observational design . . This systematic review identify safety checklist effective safety tool various clinical setting . Their use reduce patient mortality morbidity . In addition , safety checklist use associate well human performance , improve compliance evidence-based practice , promote consistency care , reduction technical omission . None include study report safety checklist negative effect patient safety issue . 2 . Implement new patient safety checklist system measure effect morbidity , mortality length hospital stay . A prospective stepped wedge trial design ( Brown &amp; Lilford , 2006 ; Brown et al. , 2008 ) use implement validated patient safety checklist system Neurosurgical Department , Orthopaedic Clinic Department Gynaecology Obstetrics HUH . Patients department use patient safety checklist system serve control , include Head Neck Clinic ( HUH ) , Thoracic Surgery Section Heart Department ( HUH ) two hospital outside municipality ( Health Trust Førde , Health Trust Fonna - Haugesund Hospital ) . Primary end-points measure prospectively include length hospital stay morbidity mortality utilize ICD-10 code complication collect electronically hospital patient administrative system . 3 . Validation morbidity mortality data Today ICD-10 code produce discharge physician summarize diagnosis discharge complication occur patient stay . In order validate HUH 's Health Trust Førde 's ICD-10 coding patient morbidity mortality randomize inclusion quality check compare ICD-10 code use discharge actual information morbidity mortality document electronic patient journal ( EPJ ) - DIPS . This validation include approximately 700 patient , undergone major surgery . Such comparison essential gain knowledge quality generate ICD-10 data thus important quality result study . 3.2 Intervention study sample Three surgical unit HUH ( Department Neurosurgery , Orthopaedic Clinic , Department Gynaecology Obstetrics ) checklist system implement . Approximately 3700 patient included 3700 patient checklist implementation . The Control Group include 7400 patient . 3.4 Data collection For study mortality morbidity extract ICD-10 code use discharge hospital NPR file , Norwegian hospital report ICD-10 code procedure cod NPR . In addition register ICD-10 code patient , collect demographic data ( age , gender , height weight ) , American Society Anaesthesiologists Physical Health Classification ( ASA ) , date admission discharge , surgical procedure major treatment . Data process Webport use system previously develop locally WHO Surgical Safety Checklist project . The primary end point , morbidity mortality , register hospitalization postoperatively 30 day . Morbidity register major complication accord American College Surgeons ' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program ( http : //www.facs.org/cqi/outcomes.html ) : organ/space surgical site infection , wound dehiscence , deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , pneumonia , re-intubation , ventilator use longer 24 hour , cardiac arrest , myocardial infarction , sepsis , shock , coma longer 24 hour , prosthetic/graft failure , bleeding . Additional complication , report de Vries ( 2010 ) include order make comparison possible . The study investigate reliability validity ICD-10 cod do detail : A prospective random selection 700 patient , 200 patient Health Trust Førde 500 patient HUH , undergone major surgery . Present knowledge suggest one several major complication cause procedure iatrogenic cause least 17 % surgical patient ( de Vries , 2010 ) . Then inclusion 700 patient need order find complication 119 case . We identify post discharge ICD-10 cod patient . These code thoroughly review accuracy completeness compare actual information document physician nurse EPJs throughout total hospital stay . Primary outcome investigate register ICD-10 code adequate sensitivity specificity compare information patient ' medical journal . 3.5 Statistics Descriptive inferential statistical method use analyse data . Confidence interval ( 95 % CI ) sensitivity specificity calculate use normal approximation standard error proportion . Mortality morbidity analyse time measurement , e.g . pre post intervention , surgical unit , i.e . use use checklist . Multiple regression analysis appropriate statistical tool use adjust covariates mortality morbidity . Calculation sample size power , expect mortality rate decrease ( 0.015 vs. 0.008 ) require sample size 3641 patient baseline post intervention group alpha ( 0.05 , 2-tailed ) , power 80 % . To calculate sample size power morbidity mitigation 27 % 17 % ( de Vries et al. , 2010 ) require much small sample size 234 baseline post intervention group constitute 80 % power alpha 0.05 , 2-tailed . Statistical analysis conduct appropriate statistical software e.g . Statistical Package Social Sciences , Stata R .</detailed_description>
