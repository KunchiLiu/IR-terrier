	<brief_title>Standard Comprehensive Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Early-Stage Breast Cancer Previously Treated With Chemotherapy Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : To evaluate whether addition chest wall + regional nodal radiation therapy ( XRT ) mastectomy breast + regional nodal XRT breast conserving surgery significantly reduce rate event invasive breast cancer recurrence-free interval ( IBC-RFI ) patient present histologically positive axillary node convert histologically negative axillary node follow neoadjuvant chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate whether addition chest wall + regional nodal XRT mastectomy breast + regional nodal XRT breast conserving surgery significantly prolong overall survival ( OS ) patient present histologically positive axillary node convert histologically negative axillary node follow neoadjuvant chemotherapy . II . To evaluate whether addition chest wall + regional nodal XRT mastectomy breast + regional nodal XRT breast conserving surgery significantly reduce rate event local-regional recurrence-free interval ( LRRFI ) patient present histologically positive axillary node convert histologically negative axillary node follow neoadjuvant chemotherapy . III . To evaluate whether addition chest wall + regional nodal XRT mastectomy breast + regional nodal XRT breast conserving surgery significantly reduce rate event distant recurrence-free interval ( DRFI ) patient present histologically positive axillary node convert histologically negative axillary node follow neoadjuvant chemotherapy . IV . To compare rate disease-free survival ( DFS ) -ductal carcinoma situ ( DCIS ) treatment arm . V. To compare rate second primary cancer ( SPC ) treatment arm . VI . To compare effect add XRT cosmetic outcome mastectomy patient reconstruction . VII . To compare effect add XRT quality life include arm problem , lymphedema , pain , fatigue . VIII . To evaluate toxicity associate radiation therapy regimen . IX . To determine whether computed tomography ( CT ) -based conformal method ( intensity-modulated radiation therapy [ IMRT ] 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy [ 3DCRT ] ) chestwall + regional nodal XRT post mastectomy regional nodal XRT breast XRT follow breast conserve surgery feasible multi-institutional set whether dose-volume analysis establish assess treatment adequacy develop normal tissue complication probability ( NTCP ) likelihood toxicity . X . To compare effect XRT patient receive mastectomy patient receive lumpectomy . XI . To examine role proliferation measure prognosticator patient residual disease neoadjuvant chemotherapy . XII . To develop predictor degree reduction local regional recurrence ( LRR ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM 1 : Patients assign 1 2 treatment group . GROUP 1A : Lumpectomy patient undergo whole breast radiation therapy use IMRT 3DCRT daily 5 day week 5 week follow radiation therapy boost lumpectomy cavity daily 5 day week 1-1/2 week . GROUP 1B : Mastectomy patient undergo radiation therapy . ARM 2 : Patients assign 1 2 treatment group . GROUP 2A : Lumpectomy patient undergo regional nodal radiation therapy whole breast radiation therapy use IMRT 3DCRT daily 5 day week 5 week follow radiation therapy boost lumpectomy cavity daily 5 day week 1-1/2 week . GROUP 2B : Mastectomy patient undergo regional nodal radiation therapy chestwall XRT use IMRT 3DCRT daily 5 day week 5 week . All patient also receive systemic therapy plan ( hormonal therapy patient hormone-receptor positive breast cancer trastuzumab anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 [ HER2 ] therapy patient breast cancer HER2-positive ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month yearly 8 year .</detailed_description>

clinical axillary nodal involvement assess palpation , ultrasound , CT scan , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan , PET/CT scan Patient must pathologic confirmation axillary nodal involvement presentation ( neoadjuvant therapy ) base either positive fine needle aspirate ( FNA ) ( demonstrate malignant cell ) positive core needle biopsy ( demonstrate invasive adenocarcinoma ) ; FNA core needle biopsy perform either palpation image guidance ; documentation axillary nodal positivity sentinel node biopsy ( neoadjuvant therapy ) permit Patients must estrogen receptor ( ER ) analysis perform primary breast tumor neoadjuvant therapy accord current American Society Clinical Oncology ( ASCO ) /College American Pathologists ( CAP ) guideline recommendation hormone receptor testing ; negative ER , assessment progesterone receptor ( PgR ) must also perform accord current ASCO/CAP guideline recommendation hormone receptor testing ( http : //www.asco.org ) Patients must HER2 test performed primary breast tumor neoadjuvant chemotherapy accord current ASCO/CAP guideline recommendation human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 test Breast Cancer ( http : //www.asco.org ) ; patient primary tumor either HER2positive HER2negative eligible Patient must complete minimum 12 week standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy consist anthracycline and/or taxanebased regimen For patient receive adjuvant chemotherapy surgery , maximum 12 week intend chemotherapy may administer must complete randomization ; ( treatment delay occur , chemotherapy must complete within 14 week ) ; dose schedule adjuvant chemotherapy investigator 's discretion ; Note : It prefer intend chemotherapy administer neoadjuvant setting Patients HER2positive tumor must receive neoadjuvant trastuzumab antiHER2 therapy ( either portion neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen ) , unless medically contraindicate At time definitive surgery , remove axillary node must histologically free cancer ; acceptable procedure assessment axillary nodal status time surgery include : Axillary node dissection Sentinel node biopsy alone Sentinel node biopsy follow axillary node dissection Note : Patients eligible whether residual invasive carcinoma surgical breast specimen whether evidence pathologic complete response ; patient find pathologically nodepositive time surgery , base sentinel node biopsy alone , candidate A011202 , study develop Alliance Oncology , NCI Cooperative Group ; A011202 open investigator 's institution , patient approach participate A011202 study Patients pathologic stag ypN0 ( i+ ) ypN0 ( mol+ ) eligible ( Note : Postneoadjuvant therapy designate `` yp '' prefix . ) Patient undergone either total mastectomy lumpectomy eligible For patient undergo lumpectomy , margin resect specimen reexcision must histologically free invasive tumor DCIS determine local pathologist ; additional operative procedure may perform obtain clear margin ; tumor still present resect margin reexcision ( ) , patient must undergo total mastectomy eligible ; ( patient margin positive lobular carcinoma situ [ LCIS ] eligible without additional resection ) For patient undergo mastectomy , margin must histologically free residual ( microscopic gross ) tumor The interval last surgery breast cancer ( include reexcision margin ) randomization must 56 day ; also , adjuvant chemotherapy administer , interval last chemotherapy treatment randomization must 56 day The patient must recover surgery incision completely heal sign infection If adjuvant chemotherapy administer , chemotherapyrelated toxicity may interfere delivery radiation therapy resolve Definitive clinical radiologic evidence metastatic disease T4 tumor include inflammatory breast cancer Documentation axillary nodal positivity neoadjuvant therapy sentinel node biopsy alone N2 N3 disease detect clinically image Patients histologically positive axillary node post neoadjuvant therapy Patients microscopic positive margin definitive surgery Synchronous previous contralateral invasive breast cancer DCIS ;
