	<detailed_description>Background : Hospitalized old adult 59.8 time likely develop disability hospitalize . No study examine effectiveness Home Health ( HH ) physical therapy improve function old adult multiple co-morbidities hospitalization . Our goal enable old adult multiple chronic condition recover function provide adequate content dose intervention hospitalization . This intervention design work within exist Medicare system potential immediate clinical impact . Purpose : The primary aim study determine progressive multi-component ( PMC ) intervention , initiate upon discharge acute care hospital , improve gait speed end one 60-day episode care , document usual care ( UC ) physical therapy . We hypothesize great improvement gait speed measure PMC group compare UC group follow one episode care . Benefits PMC apparent end usual care increase end 60 day episode care ( primary endpoint ) . Design : We propose conduct single blind randomized two arm clinical trial ( RCT ) old adult discharge acute care refer HH physical therapy . Both intervention ( PMC &amp; UC ) Medicare-reimbursed . All assessment intervention occur patient ' home . Methods : Twenty individual 65 year age old multiple co-morbid condition enrol .</detailed_description>
