	<detailed_description>HP-hMG , recombinant FSH ( r-hFSH ) combination r-hFSH/r-hLH , commonly use ovarian stimulation infertile woman undergo IVF/ICSI treatment . Several publication compare effectiveness compound , term clinical outcome . Most study perform woman undergo pituitary down-regulation GnRH agonist long protocol , focus outcome r-hFSH HP-hMG ovarian stimulation . Two meta-analyses show well outcome term live birth rate HP-hMG ovarian stimulation compare r-hFSH GnRH agonist long protocol . These study mainly compare different dose regimen two drug use clinical population , r-hFSH HP-hMG . Recently two clinical randomize study compare , non-inferiority design , dose regimen two drug . The result confirm non inferiority HP-hMG formulation term pregnancy rate compare r-hFSH formulation , significantly high drug consumption lower yield oocyte recovery . In clinical practice HP-hMG clinical favor treatment LH activity request ovarian stimulation success , due LH activity guarantee extractive hCG add formulation . Several study address issue need convenience add LH activity FSH ovarian stimulation IVF/ICSI-ET order increase clinical outcome IVF/ICSI cycle , able address role LH administration play follicular phase stimulate cycle IVF-ET pituitary suppression . In case r-hFSH administration , normo-gonadotrophic patient , low level endogenous LH persist despite pituitary down-regulation GnRH analogues . It know 1 % LH receptor need occupied drive adequate ovarian steroidogenesis reproduction . But potential benefit additional exogenous LH supplementation ART still controversial . Different meta-analyses demonstrate benefit r-hLH supplementation increase clinical outcome . However , patient advance age undergo ART , likely include large proportion poor responder , addition r-hLH seem beneficial . In previous study , investigator demonstrate r-hLH supplementation ovarian stimulation , significantly reduce apoptosis cumulus cell , improve oocyte competence necessary adequate fertilization consecutive embryogenesis end implantation . Given background , seem appropriate investigate effect three different ovarian stimulation protocol ( HP-hMG , r-hFSH r-hFSH/r-hLH ) , use routine ovarian stimulation therapy , pilot prospective observational study , evaluate effect recombinant LH extractive hCG ( LH like activity ) biological outcome well clinical outcome . The apoptosis rate cumulus cell , usually discard oocyte collection , use molecular biomarker ass oocyte quality , biological outcome . The clinical outcome estimate measure implantation ongoing pregnancy rate within three different ovarian stimulation protocol</detailed_description>
