	<brief_title>A Trial Assess Effect Safety C-Qur™ Film</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Adhesions fibrous band connect tissue surface anatomical connection normally exist . Adhesion tenacity appear related maturity , filmy heavily vascularize sensory nerve fiber . Adhesions form tissue surface injure ( abrasion , desiccation , lysis , etc . ) subsequent process fibrinolysis interrupt . Adhesions develop 90 % patient undergoing intra-abdominal surgical procedure . The clinically relevant symptom adhesion formation small bowel obstruction , secondary infertility pain . Other consequence complication postsurgical intra-abdominal adhesion formation include inadvertent enterotomy increase dissection time due adhesiolysis repeat surgery . The C-Qur™ Film offer reduction adhesion formation correspond potential reduction small bowel obstruction , secondary infertility , pain incidence enterotomy prolong dissection time subsequent abdominal surgery . Objective : The primary objective ass whether use C-Qur™ Film decrease incidence adhesion formation subject undergoing colorectal surgery temporary loop ileostomy loop/split colostomy . Treatment application C-Qur™ Film adhesion prevention barrier colorectal surgery compare control group second stage ostomy takedown procedure . The primary outcome evaluation assessment adhesion incision site . Safety objective ass number type post-operative complication . Study design : This prospective , physician initiate , randomize , control , multicenter trial . Eligible subject undergoing colorectal resection require temporary loop ileostomy loop/split colostomy laparotomy hand assist laparoscopy include trial . Before closure , patient randomize 1:1 either treatment arm ( C-Qur™ Film ) control arm ( adhesion barrier ) . Subjects return 8-16 week post-colorectal resection loop ileostomy colostomy surgically take . During loop ileostomy/colostomy takedown , adhesion evaluate incidence , extent , severity . Study population : Males females 18 year age old , undergoing elective open hand assist laparoscopic colorectal resection colorectal disease formation temporary loop ileostomy loop/split colostomy . Intervention : In subject assign treatment arm , C-Qur™ Film must apply incision . Preferably also apply area consider adhesiogenic , except anastomosis . The number C-Qur™ Film sheet place abdomen limited maximum area coverage 774cm2 ( Please refer Table 2 section 6.6 maximum number sheet size ) . Main study parameters/endpoints : The primary endpoint incidence adhesion incision site subject undergoing colorectal surgery temporary loop ileostomy loop/split colostomy . Secondary endpoint include : - Incidence adhesion loop ileostomy colostomy site - Extent severity adhesion incision site - Extent severity adhesion loop ileostomy colostomy sit - Duration ileostomy takedown start takedown time bowel reposition abdomen - Percentage ( % ) abdominal wall adhesion Safety : • Type frequency surgical medical complication , include type surgical site infection</detailed_description>
