	<brief_title>A Safety Effectiveness Study Golimumab Japanese Patients With Moderately Severely Active Ulcerative Colitis .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This double-blind ( neither physician participant know treatment participant receives ) , placebo-controlled ( study inactive substance give one group participant , study medication give another group ) , multicenter ( study conduct multiple site ) , 2-arm ( two group ) , parallel-group ( group participant treat time ) , randomized-withdrawal ( participant receive study medication specify time later randomize receive either study medication placebo . ) study , include open-label ( people know identity intervention ) induction phase . Approximately 200 participant participate study . This study consist induction phase , maintenance phase , follow-up phase . During induction phase ( last 6 week ) participant receive 200 mg subcutaneous ( SC ) ( skin ) golimumab Week 0 100 mg SC golimumab Week 2 . During maintenance phase ( Week 52 ) participant show clinical response ( measure therapeutic effect study medication ) golimumab induction phase randomly allocate 1:1 ratio receive either SC administration placebo ( Group 1 ) 100 mg golimumab ( Group 2 ) every 4 week Week 0 Week 52 . Participants show clinical response golimumab also receive 100 mg SC administration golimumab Week 4 , Week 8 maintenance phase , participant 's disease activity appear improving , participant discontinue study medication administration follow safety evaluation 16 week last administration study medication . However , disease activity participant improve Week 8 , continue receive golimumab ( 100 mg every 4 week ) Week 52 maintenance phase . The follow-up phase 16 week duration . During study , participant clinical response induction phase lose clinical response time eligible dose adjustment follow : 1 ) participant receive placebo ( Group 1 ) receive golimumab 100 mg ; 2 ) participant receive golimumab 100 mg ( Group 2 ) continue receive golimumab 100 mg. Safety evaluation include assessment adverse event , laboratory measurement , antinuclear antibodies/anti-double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid antibody , vital sign . The maximum study duration participant 68 week .</detailed_description>
