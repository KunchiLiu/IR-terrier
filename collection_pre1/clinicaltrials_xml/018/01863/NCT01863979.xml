	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common sustain cardiac arrhythmia prevalence increase age population . It reflect ECG record replacement regular P-waves undulate baseline irregular ventricular complex [ 2 ] . The uncoordinated atrial activity prevents effective atrial contraction , lead clot formation . Atrial fibrillation contribute significantly population morbidity mortality , presently available therapeutic approach major limitation , include limited efficacy potentially serious side effect . It classify one three follow category : 1 . Paroxysmal : self-termination within 7 day 2 . Persistent : require termination pharmacological direct-current electric cardioversion 3 . Permanent : restoration sinus rhythm impossible inadvisable It believe many case natural history AF involve evolution paroxysmal persistent permanent form influence atrial remodeling cause arrhythmia and/or progression underlie heart disease . As many underlying condition contribute development progression AF , full exact mechanism stand behind common arrhythmia completely sufficiently understood . Thromboembolism far important complication AF , common factor stroke elderly . The determinant Virchow triad , include stasis , endothelial damage , coagulation property , centrally involve AF- related thrombus formation . Hence , thorough search new possible cause contribute factor develop progression AF threaten complication , thromboembolism , mandatory The aim study look new possible cause atrial fibrillation complication .</brief_summary>
