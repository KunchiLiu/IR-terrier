	<brief_summary>Dysferlin protein important role repair muscle surface membrane . Mutations dysferlin cause different form muscular dystrophy . Dysferlinopathies inherit autosomal recessive manner , many patient disease harbor mis-sense mutation least one two pathogenic DYSF allele . These patient significantly reduce absent dysferlin level skeletal muscle , suggest dysferlin encode mis-sense allele rapidly degrade cell 's quality-control system . In series in-vitro experiment show mis-sense mutated dysferlin salvage degradation proteasomal inhibition . This result increase functional dysferlin protein subsequent repair plasma membrane culture patient-derived muscle cell . In proof-of-concept study would like test wether proteasomal inhibition salvage mis-sense mutate dysferlin patient harbor certain dysferlin mis-sense mutation .</brief_summary>
