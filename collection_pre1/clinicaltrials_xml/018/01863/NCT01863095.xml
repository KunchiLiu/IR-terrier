	<brief_summary>Currently , marijuana ( MJ ) popular illicit drug , effective intervention help young adult ( age 18 25 year ) reduce MJ intake . In study , develop initially test smart phone app design promote exercise/physical activity positive alternative MJ use . The app test efficacy study MJ user randomly either receive personalize feedback MJ use + use exercise app personalize feedback . The result contribute knowledge exercise/physical activity strategy reduce young adult ' MJ use problem .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Exercise App Reduce Young Adults ' MJ Use</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , marijuana ( MJ ) popular illicit drug , prevalence study indicate increase use among young adult ( Johnston et al. , 2011 ) . Even , effective intervention help MJ user reduce intake avoid negative consequence , include MJ dependence . The investigator propose Stage 1 efficacy study develop initially test innovative intervention reduce MJ use among young adult regularly use MJ ( &gt; 3 episodes/week ) . The intervention include element Marijuana Check-Up ( MCU ; Stephens et al. , 2007 ) , MI-based brief intervention show promise reduce MJ use . It also incorporate finding ongoing research , suggest exercise/physical activity ( PA ) potential positive alternative MJ use . The investigator research also show short ( i.e. , 10 minute ) bouts moderate intense exercise reduce craving/urges use MJ . Exercise intervention successfully reduce use licit substance , tobacco ( e.g. , Marcus et al. , 2005 ) alcohol ( e.g. , Brown et al. , 2009 ) , adequately test MJ use . The two aim R34 application : 1 ) To develop intervention consist four , 60-minute , in-person session compose MCU content ( e.g. , personalized feedback , MI ) well smart phone application ( app ) promote exercise/physical activity ( EA ) alternative MJ use . The EA , design specifically appeal young adult , provide readily-accessible , flexible , convenient platform personalize information reminder promote exercise/PA positive alternative MJ use ongoing daily life . 2 ) To conduct pilot/efficacy study 4-week MCU+EA intervention vs. MCU-only control condition . The investigator use urn randomization assign emerging/young-adult MJ user ( N = 40 ) two condition . During 1-week baseline , 4-week intervention phase , 1- , 3- , 6-month follow-up , participant use smart phone app provide real-time data MJ-related variable wear accelerometer provide PA data . Multilevel model use test hypothesis MCU+EA intervention , compare MCU-only control , produce great decrease quantity frequency MJ use ( related MJ problem ) post-intervention follow-up . Multilevel modeling also use explore real-time data examine role variable urge/craving MJ , social factor , dosage PA reduction quantity frequency MJ use . This Stage 1 study unique innovative development use smart phone app promote evaluate exercise/PA positive alternative MJ use daily life . It include cutting-edge technology ( e.g. , accelerometer , smart phone app ) real-time assessment . This research make significant contribution limit knowledge exercise/PA strategy reduce MJ use relate problem among emerge young adult .</detailed_description>
