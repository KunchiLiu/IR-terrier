	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Pharmacokinetics JNJ-38518168 Patients With Mild Moderate Hepatic Impairment Compared With Patients With Normal Hepatic Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( [ participant investigator ] know treatment participant receive ) multicenter study . The study consist 3 phase : screening phase ( approximately 3 week ) , treatment phase ( day -2 [ 2 day administration study medication ] Day 18 ) , end-of-study phase ( 7 10 day last dose study medication ) . Approximately 24 participant ( participant mild hepatic impairment , moderate hepatic impairment , normal liver function ) receive JNJ-38518168 14 day . Hepatic impairment evaluate accord Child-Pugh score . It consist 5 clinical measure ( amount ascites [ abnormal accumulation fluid abdomen ] , total bilirubin [ mg/dL ] , albumin [ g/dL ] , international normalize ratio , degree encephalopathy [ abnormal functioning brain ] ) . Each score 0 ( less severity ) 3 ( high severity ) . Total Child-Pugh score sum subscores grade : mild ( 5-6 point ) , moderate ( 7-9 point ) , severe ( 10-15 point ) . Safety evaluate assessment adverse event , clinical laboratory test , vital sign , body weight , physical examination , 12-lead electrocardiogram monitor various timepoints throughout study . The total duration study participation participant approximately 6 week .</detailed_description>
