	<brief_summary>The purpose study see cold liquid improve swallow mechanism premature infant swallow difficulty ( dysphagia ) . The way objectively diagnose dysphagia infant undergo Video Fluoroscopic Swallow Study ( VFSS ) , allow direct visualization liquid bolus ( barium ) real time . Infants suspect dysphagia refer VFSS recruit study . Once consent , infant undergo standard VFSS . If infant diagnose dysphagia , study protocol begin keep infant position feed cold liquid barium identical bottle . A total 5 swallow visualize , add approximately 5-10 second study . Both standard swallow study swallow record analysis comparison . It hypothesize study swallow less deficit standard swallow . If infant 's standard VFSS indicate dysphagia , infant longer eligible study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Cold Liquids Swallowing Mechanism Preterm Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Swallowing complex task take place mouth throat . It involve tiny receptor gather sensory information liquid . Those receptor send sensory message brain , process . The brain send back motor message muscle throat regard kind motor movement order swallow liquid safely . The motor movement must carefully time coordinate safely swallow liquid go near , lung . When liquid go wrong tube , lung , call aspiration . Some infant bear prematurely end swallowing problem drink bottle . This problem lead liquid , formula breastmilk , aspirate . This due infant 's poor coordination muscle need safely swallow . Researchers find change sensory characteristic liquid alters motor movement swallow . This sensory receptor respond differently different type liquid . Studies use adult swallow problem show swallow cold liquid improve swallow difficulty . Based observation , currently several therapy use Neonatal Intensive Care Units ( NICU ) nationwide use cold stimulation improve swallow prematurely born infant , although , research study prove actually work . The purpose study assess effect cold liquid swallow mechanism preterm infant swallow difficulty . A video x-ray procedure , call Videofluoroscopic Swallow Study ( VFSS ) , consider gold standard assess motor movement present throat swallowing . The standard procedure infant VFSS involve bottle feeding room temperature liquid barium look swallow movement obtain video x-ray image . After consent obtain , infant assume swallow difficulty undergo `` standard '' VFSS . If study find swallow problem , study protocol begin introduce cold liquid barium identical bottle . A total 5 swallow look record review later time . The standard procedure infant 's VFSS continue . The hypothesis cold liquid improve swallow movement premature infant swallow difficulty . Information gather support use cold liquid cold stimulation NICUs help benefit infant .</detailed_description>
