	<brief_summary>Concurrent chemotherapy external beam radiotherapy standard treatment bulky locally advanced cervical cancer , gastric cancer rectal cancer.Despite excellent therapeutic result , acute hematologic toxicity ( HT ) common regimen . Previous study found acute HT significantly associate volume pelvic ( PBM ) lumbosacral bone marrow ( LSBM ) receive 10 20 Gy radiation ( RT ) . Therefore , reduce volume BM receive low-dose RT might prevent HT . More one-half body 's bone marrow ( BM ) locate PBM , LSBM proximal , low dose RT patient gastric , rectal cervical cancer . Previous study demonstrate highly conformal IMRT treatment plan reduce volume PBM irradiate result less HT . We since assume even well BM spar possible BM enter separate constraint planning process . However , well know hematopoietically active ( red ) BM poorly visualize compute tomography ( CT ) . Consequently , entire content medullary canal must enter BM . Yet , considerable portion medullary canal comprise inactive ( yellow ) marrow , compose primarily fat . Contouring entire medullary canal CT thus overestimate volume active BM , unnecessarily constrain IMRT plan . An alternative approach incorporation functional BM image treatment planning process . One economical efficiency approach involve use T1-weighted magnetic resonance ( MR ) image . Therefore , design study test whether separate constraint active BM identify MR could reduce acute HT course concurrent chemoradiotherapy patient gastric rectal cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1、Simulation All patient underwent compute tomography ( CT ) simulation supine position gastric cancer patient The CT scan obtain T4 vertebral body L5 cm . Oral contrast intravenous contrast administer prior CT scan . All patient underwent compute tomography ( CT ) simulation prone position rectal cancer patient full bladder use belly board minimize exposure small bowel . Oral contrast intravenous contrast administer prior CT scan . A radio-opaque marker place anal margin . The superior inferior limit acquire transaxial data ( set topogram ) iliac crest 5 cm inferior anal marker , respectively . Intravenous contrast administer prior CT scan . 2.Radiotherapy chemotherapy For gastric cancer patient surgery chemotherapy , 4500 cGy radiation deliver 25 fraction , five day per week , tumor bed , regional node , 2 cm beyond proximal distal margin resection . The tumor bed defined preoperative compute tomographic ( CT ) imaging , barium roentgenography , instance , surgical clip . Perigastric , celiac , local paraaortic , splenic , hepatoduodenal hepatic-portal , pancreaticoduodenal lymph node include radiation field . In patient tumor gastroesophageal junction , paracardial paraesophageal lymph node include radiation field . Concurrent chemotherapy regimen monotherapy capecitabine 1600mg∙m2 twice day ( b.i.d. ) . For rectal cancer patient surgery , The rectum opacified barium order avoid contour artifact . The gross tumor volume ( GTV ) generate CT scan , MR scan endoscopic ultrasonography result . Only clinical target volume ( CTV ) delineate , encompass entire mesorectum , Pararectal nod also include , together presacral promontory node ( limit L5-S1 interspace ) , internal iliac node venous bifurcation . External iliac node include site recurrence experience . On contrary , internal pudendal node include CTV . Organs risk also contour : bladder ( intravenous contrast ) , small bowel ( oral contrast ) femoral head . The small bowel contour CT slice could visualize , highly variable among patient . IMRT give 5000 cGy 25 fraction ( 5 week ) . Concurrent chemotherapy consist oxaliplatin ( 50 mg/m2 ) intravenously 2 h day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 29 , capecitabine ( 825 mg/m2 twice day ) give orally day radiation . 3 . Active bone marrow definition All patient scan supine position 1.5 T MR scanner . For gastric cancer patient , image obtain T8 L4 gastric cancer patient . For rectal cancer patient , image obtain L3-4 interspace ischial tuberosity rectal cancer patient . The MR image subsequently fuse plan CT scan use commercially available image fusion software . The interactive mode fusion software use whereby user manually translate rotates MR scan produce best visual overlay two image set . A mutual information algorithm use perform fine adjustment . The CT MR image ( resliced along plane CT scan ) subsequently display side-by-side . BM region T1-weighted image show signal intensity equal slightly high muscle contour active BM . The range active BM 3cm beyond upper limit PTV 3cm low limit PTV .</detailed_description>
