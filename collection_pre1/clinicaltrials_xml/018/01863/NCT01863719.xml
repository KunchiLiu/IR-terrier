	<brief_summary>Colistin amphipathic , absorbed gastrointestinal tract administer intramuscularly , intravenously ( IV ) via inhalation . In case pneumonia , aerosolize route administration favorable presumably delivers high concentration drug directly infection site . Colistimethate sodium FDA approve drug , however , aerosolize use represent new method administration currently FDA-approved United States . In proposal , inactive prodrug colistimethate sodium select use aerosolization well tolerate colistin sulphate . It randomize , open-labeled Phase 1 trial aerosolize and/or IV formulation colistin multiple dos seven day . The primary objective trial evaluate safety tolerability multiple dos aerosolize intravenous colistimethate sodium separately combination healthy adult subject .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Aerosolized Intravenous Colistin Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>`` Colistin '' ( first breakdown product colistimethate sodium , also know polymyxin E ) comprise approximately 30 different polymyxin , colistin A ( polymyxin E1 ) colistin B ( polymyxin B ) accounting upwards 85 % mass . It amphipathic , absorbed gastrointestinal tract administer intramuscularly , intravenously ( IV ) via inhalation . While approved aerosolized use United Kingdom , use Europe decade , aerosolize colistin FDA-approved United States . The intravenous formulation approve use U.S. , due age drug , undergo rigorous study safety prior FDA-approval . Thus , detail pharmacokinetic data limit dose standardize , although maximum IV dose exceed 5mg/kg/day , divide two four equal dos . In United Kingdom , recommend dose nebulized colistin adult one million unit ( 1MIU ) twice daily . Despite paucity dose safety guideline , aerosolize colistin prescribe regularly necessity give emergence multi-drug resistant organism ( MDROs ) . MDROs strongly associate nosocomial pneumonia several strain susceptible old drug , thus urgent need clarification safe use colistin , include aerosolized form delivers high concentration drug directly infection site . This randomized , open-labeled Phase 1 trial aerosolize and/or IV formulation colistin multiple dos seven day . 39 healthy male female subject , 18-45 year age admit inpatient study outpatient follow-up . The primary objective trial evaluate safety tolerability multiple dos aerosolize intravenous colistimethate sodium separately combination healthy adult subject . The secondary objective trial determine pharmacokinetics multiple daily dos aerosolize intravenous colistimethate sodium separately combination healthy adult subject . Subjects participate 25 day plus screen follow-up appointment . The duration study shall two year , include screening , study conduct ( include schedule SMC review ) , study follow-up preparation report .</detailed_description>
