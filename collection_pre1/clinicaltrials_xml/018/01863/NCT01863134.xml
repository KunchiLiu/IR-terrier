	<brief_summary>1 . INTRODUCTION Through last couple year number patient treat acute coronary event without persistent ST segment elevation ECG grow . This probably effect improve diagnostics myocardial infraction without persistent ST segment elevation ECG , due routine Troponin serum level evaluation well primary prevention . This fact make search optimal treatment patient acute coronary event without persistent ST segment elevation ECG , include patient intended pharmacological invasive treatment percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) coronary artery byppass grafting ( CABG ) . Patients undergo invasive treatment acute coronary event , high risk rate , stabile angina pectoris . The author study want evaluate , whether proportional use platelet GP IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist - eptifibatide patient undergo CABG result improvement short- , long time result patient . Eptifibatide ( Integrilin ) cyclic heptapeptide antagonist GP IIb/IIIa integrin receptor , intravenous antagonist rapid onset short half-life . 2 . STUDY RATIONALE The notion acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) include several clinical situation , unstable coronary artery disease , non-Q wave myocardial infarction Q wave myocardial infarction . On basis 12-lead ECG , patient acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) divide two group : without ST segment elevation . Another stratification factor patient ACS , especially without ST elevation evaluation biochemical marker myocardial necrosis , Troponins ( TnI , TnT ) creatinine kinase isoenzymes ( CK-MB ) . Serum concentration marker allow distinguish myocardial infarction ( elevation marker ' concentration ) unstable coronary artery disease . All ACS common etiopathogenesis plaque rupture , thrombus formation lumen coronary artery . Platelets key factor process . Platelets mean collagen von Willebrand factor glycoprotein receptor bind damage artery wall . Simultaneously many factor cause platelet activation , lead change shape , release intraplatelet component activation fibrinogen-binding glycoprotein receptor IIb/IIIa ( GP IIb/IIIa ) . Activated form GP IIb/IIIa bind GP IIb/IIIa another platelet mean fibrinogen molecule . Fibrinogen molecules form stable bridge platelet . This process refer aggregation , lead clot formation , stabilize fibrine fibre . In way intravascular thrombus form , totally occlude arterial lumen cause acute ischemia relevant region myocardium subsequently infarction . The key role GP IIa/IIIb process platelet clot formation important therapeutic consequence . By several specific ( direct ) non-specific ( indirect ) antagonists GP IIb/IIIa develop . There indirect antagonist acetylsalicylic acid , ticlopidine clopidogrel direct antagonist abciximab , tirofiban eptifibatide Additionally also anticoagulants ( heparin , LMWH - low molecular weight heparin ) antiplatelet property inhibit thrombin production . Clinical study perform world proven efficacy safety three agent GP Iia/IIIb group : abciximab , tirofiban eptifibatide . In several big clinical study ( EPIC , EPILOG , EPISTENT , ESPRIT , CAPTURE , PURSUIT , PRISM-PLUS , TACTICS-TIMI 18 ) high efficacy drug show patient ACS without ST segment elevation undergo mainly percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography ( PTCA ) stenting . The use GP IIa/IIIb antagonist group patient significantly reduce death myocardial infarction ( MI ) rate early well late follow-up period . Moreover , last observation indicate , big benefit therapeutic strategy observe high risk patient ; diabetes , high troponin level ECG change . During last year , increase frequency ACS without ST segment elevation . This probably due improve diagnostics MI without ST elevation base routine troponin evaluation , also thank well primary prevention . Therefore determine optimal therapeutic strategy patient ACS without ST segment elevation remain crucial issue . It concern patient qualified medical treatment well qualified invasive procedure ( PTCA CABG ) .</brief_summary>
