	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effect transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) modify hyperphagia obese subject , non-obese subject , subject Prader-Willi syndrome ( PWS ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Startle-response Test Assess Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation-induced Modulation Hyperphagia Prader-Willi Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PWS characterize hypotonia , feed difficulty , developmental delay failure thrive infancy , insatiable appetite ( hyperphagia ) , rapid weight gain obesity early childhood . Hyperphagia one prominent debilitating feature PWS , currently pharmaceutical drug successful decrease appetite patient . tDCS safe , noninvasive method whereby weak electric current directly transmit brain via external electrode connect 9-volt radio battery . It base decades-old observation nerve cell fire alter low amplitude direct current ( DC ) . The researcher study believe tDCS may positive impact hyperphagia weight . In study , investigator intend assess whether effect tDCS differ obese subject , non-obese subject , subject Prader-Willi syndrome measure amplitude latency eyeblink startle response set food- non-food-related visual stimulus subject , various hyperphagia questionnaire , cognitive behavioral assessment . It hypothesize group , subject Prader-Willi syndrome demonstrate behavioral psychometric evidence abnormal food image processing , crave associate behavior relative control group , group may receive potentially beneficial effect tDCS session . Obese subject also predict decreased hyperphagia food craving result tDCS .</detailed_description>
