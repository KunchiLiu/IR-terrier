	<detailed_description>Pectus excavatum , common chest wall deformity , occur roughly one 1000 children.1 Operative repair anterior thoracic concavity transition minimally invasive approach substernal bar placement small axillary incision ( Nuss procedure multiple modification ) . These procedure quickly incorporate high volume center around world include own.2-7 The operation certainly quicker associate less blood loss open operation , oppose minimally invasive version operation , patient leave hospital sooner bar placement experience post-operative pain.6,7,8 Pain post-operative hospital stay dominant management issue bar placement . The sparse literature topic suggest thoracic epidural effective mean attenuate pain first post-operative days.10-12 Therefore ; center approach patient undergoing pectus deformity repair attempt epidural placement assumption provide effective strategy pain control.3-9 , 13 However , investigator conduct retrospective evaluation examine validity assumption investigate whether role prospective study determine optimum post-operative pain management patients.14 The investigator find length stay short PCA pain score similar . What investigator find certainly challenge assumption epidural optimum management patient , convincingly answer question whether role prospective randomize trial . The investigator conduct prospective , randomized trial 110 patients.15 The investigator find pain score well epidural first 2 day well PCA last 2 day . There difference length stay although trend favor PCA . Epidural group incur far great operation time charge . The pragmatic interpretation investigator use PCA . The anesthesia interpretation investigator need good epidural . Therefore , investigator develop good protocol transition try improve pain control last 2 day . Further , investigator recognize several flaw last study ; investigator include patient extremes age n't represent normal course . Second , investigator keep patient hospital bowel movement may prolong care unnecessarily PCA group . The investigator use sample size last time since difference length stay investigator design detect day clinically relevant .</detailed_description>
