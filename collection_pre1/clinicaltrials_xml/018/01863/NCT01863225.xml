	<criteria>Male female patient ≥ 18 ≤ 65 year age without documented coronary artery disease . Taking statin therapy least 30 day prior Screening ( Visit 1 ) . In opinion investigator , patient currently statin therapy atorvastatin 40 mg rosuvastatin 20 mg atorvastatin 80 mg rosuvastatin 40 mg could switch one regimens Visit 1 duration study . Clinically significant heart disease require coronary bypass , PCI , cardiac transplantation , surgical repair and/or replacement course study . Coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) procedure within past 90 day . Have body mass index ( BMI ) great 36 kg/m2 . Patients East Asian descent ( due pharmacological food effect note rosuvastatin ) . Previous current diagnosis severe heart failure ( NYHA Class IIIIV ) document left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 25 % determine contrast leave ventriculography , radionuclide ventriculography echocardiography . The absence LVEF measurement patient without previous current diagnosis heart failure prohibit entry study . Patients evidence cardiac electrophysiologic instability include history uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia , uncontrolled atrial fibrillation/flutter uncontrolled supraventricular tachycardia ventricular response heart rate &gt; 100 beat per minute rest within 4 week prior Visit 1 . Evidence renal impairment Have hypertension uncontrolled define 2 consecutive measurement sit blood pressure systolic &gt; 160 mmHg diastolic &gt; 95 mmHg Visit 1 . Women childbearing potential agree use two reliable method birth control study one month follow last dose study drug , pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman . Where pregnancy define state female conception termination gestation , confirm positive ßhCG laboratory test ( ≥ 5 IU/L ) time enrollment .
