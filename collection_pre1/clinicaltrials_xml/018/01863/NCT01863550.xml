	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study bortezomib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone see well work compare carfilzomib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone treat patient newly diagnose multiple myeloma . Bortezomib carfilzomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , lenalidomide dexamethasone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving bortezomib carfilzomib together lenalidomide dexamethasone may kill cancer cell</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare overall survival two strategy lenalidomide maintenance follow induction proteasome inhibitor-IMiD ( lenalidomide ) combination : limited duration maintenance ( 24 month ) versus indefinite maintenance therapy disease progression . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare progression-free survival two strategy lenalidomide maintenance follow induction proteasome inhibitor-IMiD combination : limited duration maintenance ( 24 month ) indefinite maintenance therapy disease progression . II . To compare progression-free survival bortezomib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone ( VRd ) carfilzomib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone ( CRd ) induction follow lenalidomide maintenance patient newly diagnose symptomatic multiple myeloma . III . To compare induction rate response VRd CRd arm . IV . To evaluate time progression , duration response overall survival VRd CRd induction therapy . V. To compare induction rate toxicity VRd CRd arm . VI . To evaluate toxicity lenalidomide maintenance . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare short long-term health-related quality life impact two strategy lenalidomide maintenance follow induction proteasome inhibitor-IMiD combination : limited duration maintenance ( 24 month ) versus indefinite maintenance therapy disease progression . II . To compare impact health-related quality life VRd CRd induction therapy . III . To evaluate association early induction response change health-related quality life . IV . To describe change health-related quality life induction , active maintenance observation phase . V. To evaluate correlation treatment adherence maintenance health-related quality life . VI . To compare induction minimal residual disease negativity rate VRd CRd arm . VII . To compare minimal residual disease negativity rate two strategy lenalidomide maintenance follow induction proteasome inhibitor-IMiD combination : limited duration maintenance ( 24 month ) versus indefinite maintenance therapy disease progression . VIII . To describe change minimal residual disease induction , active maintenance observation phase explore association response . IX . To evaluate gene expression profile tumor cell baseline among standard risk patient explore development prognostic gene expression signature standard risk myeloma . X . To evaluate change gene expression profile tumor cell follow treatment elucidate response resistance mechanism . OUTLINE : INDUCTION : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive bortezomib subcutaneously ( SC ) intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 course 1-8 day 1 8 course 9-12 ; lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily day 1-14 ; dexamethasone PO daily day 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 8 , 9 , 11 , 12 course 1-8 day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 course 9-12 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients receive carfilzomib IV 30 minute day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 ; lenalidomide PO daily day 1-21 ; dexamethasone PO day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 9 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE : After completion induction therapy , patient randomize 1 2 maintenance treatment arm . ARM C : Patients receive lenalidomide PO daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM D : Patients receive lenalidomide PO daily day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually 10 year .</detailed_description>
