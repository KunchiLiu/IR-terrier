	<brief_title>Impact Home Monitoring Decrease Treatment Burden Neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration ( AMD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Without frequent measurement vision monitor disease progression people may under-treated , others over-treated . Under-treatment lead severe irreversible disease progression associate loss vision . Over-treatment expensive , uncomfortable potentially increase risk complication . A self-monitoring device DigiSight help subject keep close control treatment , alleviate burden office monitoring visit . A decreased number office visit combination home self-monitoring may provide effective alternative dose regimen , allow physician subject closely track disease progression treatment effect without demand monthly frequent visit office .</detailed_description>
