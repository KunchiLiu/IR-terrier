	<brief_summary>Background study hypothesis : Many study include prospective study demonstrate long symptomatic prodromal phase exist prior onset full-brown bipolar disorder , last 9-12 year ( Egeland et al. , 2000 ) . During prodromal stage , three main cluster syndrome , include hypomania/mania symptom , depressive symptom , sign attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( Correll et al. , 2007 ; Tillman et al. , 2003 ; Mantere et al. , 2008 ) . Of hypomania/mania symptom , decrease sleep , elevate mood , irritability , mood lability , increase energy , psychomotor agitation present frequently . The prodromal depressive symptom report depressed mood , anhedonia , insomnia , feeling worthlessness . Among patient bipolar disorder , 22.5 % report comorbid pediatric ADHD . In addition , symptom consider non-specific decreased functioning , anger outburst , social isolation , anxiety ( Egeland et al. , 2000 ) . Offspring parent bipolar disorder much likely present prodromal symptom compare offspring healthy parent . In 10-year longitudinal study use 55 prodromal symptom checklist , , Egeland et al . ( 2002 ) find 38 % offspring parent bipolar disorder consider risk compare 17 % child healthy parent . In 15-year follow-up study , Duffy et al. , ( 2009 ) find 32.7 % offspring ( age 8-25 year old ) parent bipolar disorder meet criterion major mood episode . Objectives : One primary objective study prospectively identify prodromal stage bipolar disorder . Another primary objective conduct randomize , place-controlled trial aerobic exercise people suffer prodromal symptom extent significantly impaired function , attempt delay prevent onset full-blown bipolar disorder . Design study procedure : The study consist two phase : one-week screening period randomize , placebo-controlled , 3-month trial . During screen period , offspring parent bipolar disorder undergo systematically clinical evaluation . The offspring evaluate clinical symptom assess scale , neuropsychological test , magnetic resonance imaging . During 3-month trial period , offspring meet inclusion criterion randomly assign receive treatment aerobic exercise , placebo , wait-list group . Psychiatrists schedule assess mood , treatment outcome 3-month trial . Subjects treatment It expect 120 offspring parent bipolar disorder age 10—25 year , meet inclusion prodromal stage , include study . All offspring undertake Kiddie Sads Present Lifetime Version ( K-SADS-PL ) , 70 checklist item potential prodromal symptom suggest u well Dr. Correll et al . ( 2007 ) . The parent offspring DSM-IV ( Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders ) -defined bipolar disorder ( bipolar I II ) , confirm Chinese version Structured Clinical interview DSM-IV-TR Axis I Disorders patient edition ( SCID-I/P ) [ First et al. , 2002 ] . The offspring recruited referral parent receive psychiatric service Guangzhou psychiatric Hospital . The offspring randomly assign aerobic exercise placebo control group . The aerobic exercise would include cycling , jogging , table tennis , play badminton 40 min least 3 time week 3 month . In exercise , participant suppose exercise extent get sweaty . In placebo group , participant receive general psychoeducation , include deliver knowledge symptom , discussion suffer mental difficulty , general cop technique .

	<detailed_description>Background study hypothesis : Bipolar disorder one common recurrent mental illness , lifetime prevalence 3.9 % , cause physical well mental disability . Nearly 40 % people bipolar disorder experience least one attempt suicide , around 10 % end suicide complete . The mean age onset bipolar disorder 20 year old , peak age onset 15 19 year . Evidence show first symptom could present child early 3 year old , however , get proper diagnosis treatment bipolar disorder delay 16.3 year present first psychiatric symptom 3-15 year , 9.9 year present first psychiatric symptom 16-25 year . Such delay compromise largely treatment well functional outcome bipolar disorder . Many study include prospective study demonstrate long symptomatic prodromal phase exist prior onset full-brown bipolar disorder , last 9-12 year . During prodromal stage , three main cluster syndrome , include hypomania/mania symptom , depressive symptom , sign attention deficit hyperactivity disorder .
