	<brief_summary>The purpose study look efficacy safety lofexidine hydrochloride , alpha-2 adrenergic agonist development treatment acute withdrawal short-acting opioids . The study take place 2 part : 7-day inpatient double-blind treatment portion subject randomly assign one three dos study medication ( 2.4 mg total daily dose lofexidine , 3.2 mg total daily dose lofexidine , placebo ) follow optional open-label treatment period subject inpatient outpatient receive lofexidine variable dose additional 7 day . The Investigator hypothesize subject achieve maximum treatment effect tolerable side effect 3.2 mg total daily dose 3.2 mg 2.4 total daily dose show good efficacy placebo treat symptom acute opioid withdrawal .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy , Safety Dose-Response Study Followed Open-Label Study Lofexidine Treatment Opioid Withdrawal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3 , two-part , multicenter study evaluate dose-response , efficacy , safety lofexidine alleviation symptom subject undergoing total abrupt withdrawal short-acting opioids . Any subject dependent short-acting opioids ( primary project indication lofexidine ) undergo opioid withdrawal eligible . Subjects evaluate compliance protocol inclusion/exclusion criterion screen period , last 7 day . The first part study use inpatient , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled design ( Days 1-7 ) follow second part , open-label continuation treatment ( Days 8-14 ) . A total 600 subject randomize receive lofexidine 2.4 mg total daily dose ( 0.6 mg QID ) , lofexidine 3.2 mg total daily dose ( 0.8 mg QID ) , match placebo 3:3:2 ratio ( 225:225:150 ) 7 day ( i.e. , intense stage withdrawal ) . During second part study ( Days 8-14 ) , subject , regardless treatment assignment ( remain double-blinded ) , successfully meet definition `` completer '' base Days 1-7 ( i.e. , receive least one dose study medication Day 7 complete 3.5-hour post-dose SOWS-Gossop assessment Day 7 ) , eligible receive open-label , variable dose lofexidine treatment ( determine Site Investigator , exceed 3.2 mg/day ) additional 7 day either inpatient outpatient set depend wish investigator subject . No subject receive lofexidine 14 day total onset abstinence . There initial dose run-up mandate terminal dose taper . Efficacy safety assessment make daily throughout study . Safety assess evaluation adverse event , clinical lab , electrocardiogram ( special attention QTc ) , vital sign , physical exam data , Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale . Efficacy evaluate daily subject- observer-completed scale include Short Opiate Withdrawal Scale Gossop ( SOWS-G ) ( primary outcome measure SOWS-G score area curve Days 1-7 ) , Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scales ( COWS ) , Objective Opiate Withdrawal Scale ( OOWS-Handelsman ) , Visual Analog Scale Efficacy ( VAS-E ) , Modified Clinical Global Impressions scale efficacy side effect . Efficacy also evaluate study retention , completion rate , concomitant medication use , incidence withdrawal-related AEs , subject treatment status 30 day post last dose study medication . Qualitative urine drug screen do every day monitor contraband ( inpatient setting ) illicit ( outpatient set ) drug use . Upon subject 's exit study , Study Discontinuation/End Study assessments do . During study , study drug compliance document source daily . During first part study ( Days 1-7 ) , subject inpatient dose study medication administer study site personnel record source . Study medication dose QID 8 AM , 1 PM , 6 PM 11 PM . During second part study ( Days 8-14 ) , subject remain inpatient administer dose study medication study site personnel dose capture source . Subjects complete second part study outpatient basis return clinic daily study assessment . During open-label period , subject dispense 1-2 day worth study drug , need allow flexibility schedule daily visit , get suppose return follow day additional study assessment dose . Study medication hold vital sign meet follow criterion : Resting ( sit recumbent , require , treatment adverse event ) : Systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mmHg &gt; 20 % screen value ; Diastolic blood pressure &lt; 50 mmHg &gt; 20 % screen value ; Heart rate &lt; 50 bpm &gt; 20 % screen value ; Symptoms hypotension and/or bradycardia ( e.g. , lightheadedness , dizziness , syncope ) .Orthostatic ( stand 3 minute ) : Systolic blood pressure diastolic blood pressure , pulse &gt; 25 % recumbent value . A subject discontinue study follow criterion meet : Systolic blood pressure &lt; 70 mmHg &gt; 20 % screen value ; Diastolic blood pressure &lt; 40 mmHg &gt; 20 % screen value ; Heart rate &lt; 40 bpm &gt; 20 % screen value ; QTc &gt; 500 msec &gt; 25 % screen value male female ; Syncope ; Subject miss 2 dos 24 hour Days 1-7 prior meeting `` completer '' criterion ( i.e. , receive least one dose study medication Day 7 complete 3.5-hour post-dose SOWS-Gossop assessment Day 7 ) ; Subject miss total 6 dos Days 1-7 prior meeting `` completer '' criterion ( i.e. , receive least one dose study medication Day 7 complete 3.5-hour post-dose SOWS-Gossop assessment Day 7 ) ; Concomitant medication use ( alumina , magnesia , simethicone ) intolerable nausea emesis . Subjects discontinue study reason list , event record AE subject follow medically stabilize satisfaction attend physician : New onset clinically significant abnormal ECG ( e.g. , second third degree heart block uncontrolled arrhythmia , prolong QTcF interval ) ; Persistent symptomatic hypotension ( e.g. , hypotension respond bed rest fluid ) ; Single occurrence symptomatic bradycardia ( assessed Investigator , regardless blood pressure ) associate chest pain , shortness breath , decrease level consciousness ; Persistent hypertension - blood pressure ≥185/110 mmHg record 3 separate occasion take least 5 minute apart AND within 1-hour time period . If 3 reading ≥185/110 mmHg ( either systolic ≥185 mmHg diastolic ≥110 mmHg ) subject must terminate ; Medical Intervention Cardiovascular Event : Any medical intervention ( nonmedication medication inclusive ) use treatment cardiovascular event , exception positional intervention subject display hypotension ; Any clinically significant cardiovascular sign symptom would place subject risk .</detailed_description>
