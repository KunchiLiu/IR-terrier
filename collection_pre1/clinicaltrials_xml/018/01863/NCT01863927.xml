	<detailed_description>Ten young healthy civilian participant participate study . They go six day heat acclimation period heat chamber accord valid protocol . After heat acclimation participant randomly expose 4 condition four separate consecutive day : 1 ) walk treadmill two hour hot-wet condition ( 30OC , 70 % RH ) wear military uniform vest ( control group ) ; 2 ) walk treadmill two hour hot-dry condition ( 40OC , 30 % RH ) wear military uniform vest ( control group ) ; 3 ) walk treadmill two hour hot-wet condition ( 30OC , 70 % RH ) wear military uniform vest ventilator ( experimental group ) ; 4 ) walk treadmill two hour hot-dry condition ( 40OC , 30 % RH ) wear military uniform vest ventilator ( experimental group ) . During heat exposure , rectal temperature , skin temperature heart rate continuously monitor . Subjective comfort measure , heat strain index , sweat rate sweat evaporation also measured/calculated . The difference measure , exposure exercise heat ventilator ventilator analyze .</detailed_description>
