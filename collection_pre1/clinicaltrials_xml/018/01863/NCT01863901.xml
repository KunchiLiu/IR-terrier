	<brief_title>Study Evaluating Treatment Upper Limb Spasticity Using Cryo-Touch III Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Spasticity , common neurological disorder , part upper motor neuron syndrome displaying increase tone , clonus , spasm , spastic dystonia co- contraction . The impact spasticity patient varies subtle neurological sign severe spasticity cause pain contracture . Upper limb spasticity ( ULS ) rapid contraction shorten muscle arm cause abnormal muscle movement elbow , wrist finger . It report 1 million Americans traumatic injury brain spinal cord , stroke , multiple sclerosis cerebral palsy experience ULS . Tightly clenched fist , twisted wrist elbow joint , fix arm flexed position result extreme discomfort , pain spasm . A nonsurgical , minimally invasive , effective approach pain associate ULS desirable . Myoscience , Inc. ( Redwood City , CA ) develop pain management device - Cryo-Touch III - novel , minimally invasive procedure use focused cold therapy target sensory nerve tissue offer long-lasting pain relief cryoanalgesia . The device operate well-established cryobiology principle localize exposure control , moderately low temperature condition alter tissue function . The therapy treat nerve via probe form assembly small diameter needle , create highly localize , low temperature treatment zone around probe . This focused cold therapy create conduction block prevents nerve signal . Prior study Cryo-Touch , Cryo-Touch II , Cryo-Touch III ( a.k.a . PCP 1.0 ) device provide preliminary evidence effectiveness motor nerve show safe serious device-related adverse event .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male female , 18 year age old . 2 . Trial participant must confirm diagnosis result spasticity involve muscle innervate musculocutaneous nerve ( MCN ) . 3 . Any medication must maintain stable schedule least two week prior treatment . No washout period allow . 4 . Must average score Modified Ashworth Scale Spasticity â‰¥ 2 last 30 day elbow . 5 . Subject , Investigator 's opinion , expose unacceptable risk participation . 1 . Previous surgical intervention alter target neural anatomy upper limb . 2 . Any injection ( neurolytic , sclerosing , anesthetic , etc . ) upper limb within last 4 month . 3 . Current enrollment investigational drug device study specifically target spasticity management . 4 . Allergy intolerance local anesthesia . 5 . Any local skin condition treatment site investigator 's opinion would adversely affect treatment outcomes . 6 . Any chronic medication use ( prescription , overthecounter , etc . ) investigator 's opinion would affect study participation subject safety . 7 . Diagnosis cryoglobulinemia , paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria , cold urticaria , Raynaud 's disease , open and/or infect wound . 8 . Diagnosis progressive neurologic disease ALS . 9 . For reason , opinion investigator , subject may suitable candidate study participation ( i.e. , history noncompliance , drug dependency , relate upper limb injury , etc . ) .</criteria>
