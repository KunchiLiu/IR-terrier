	<brief_summary>The last decade witness important reduction mortality child 5 year reduction impact neonate . Mortality neonates contribute 40 % death occur child 5 year age . Severe bacterial disease among leading cause neonatal death . Bacterial disease follow bacterial infection . Individuals infect without develop disease ( carriage stage ) infection need subsequently develop disease . In sub-Saharan Africa , bacterial carriage ( i.e . birth canal and/or nasopharyngeal tract ) common age group , consequence occurrence bacterial disease one high world . Newborns infect labour - pass birth canal - first days/weeks life , consequence close physical contact mother , latter carry bacteria nasopharyngeal tract . If mother important source bacterial infection newborn , treat mother powerful antibiotic labour decrease bacterial carriage therefore diminish risk bacterial transmission newborn first days/weeks life , turn result low occurrence severe bacterial disease hence low mortality . The purpose trial evaluate impact single oral dose azithromycin give woman labour bacterial carriage newborn well woman first month delivery . The investigator select antibiotic ( azithromycin ) sub-Saharan Africa already show strong impact bacterial nasopharyngeal carriage all-cause mortality administer everybody community ( mass drug administration ) . This specific antibiotic several advantage deployable simple intervention rural Africa , i.e . require single oral administration , special storage requirement potential eliminate many bacteria commonly cause severe disease newborn . This clinical trial conduct peri-urban health facility Western Gambia . If impact show , next step would conduct large study aim establish intervention , implement low level care ( African woman deliver home assist traditional birth assistant ) , decrease occurrence neonatal bacterial disease</brief_summary>
