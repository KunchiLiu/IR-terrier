	<brief_title>Ultrasound Detection Peripheral IV Infiltration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral intravenous ( PIV ) therapy one common invasive procedure perform US hospital . A majority hospital patient require intravenous therapy year United States . Despite widespread use , number potential complication occur PIV therapy . One common cause IV complication IV infiltration extravasation . Infiltration leakage non-vesicant fluid like saline surround tissue . Extravasation leakage vesicant fluid , include cytotoxic drug , intravenous nutrition , calcium , potassium , bicarbonate solution . If detect correct early , infiltration extravasation lead significant complication severe inflammation , compartment syndrome , skin necrosis . ivWatch , LLC develop investigational device may detect IV infiltration extravasation occurrence use near infrared light sensor . Previous study evaluate performance ivWatch device compare nurse 's diagnosis . The nursing standard care relies tactile visual indicator diagnose infiltration event . The ivWatch product often signal infiltration event indicator apparent clinician . Consequently , comparison nurse 's diagnosis often lead questionable false positive ivWatch device . A good reference require evaluate performance ivWatch device . The purpose research study evaluate ability ultrasound detect PIV infiltration . Ultrasound depth-resolved imaging technique evaluate tissue microstructure . Researchers use ultrasound examine exogenous fluid inject cutaneous subcutaneous tissue . Ultrasound use detect small volume fluid cosmetic filler subcutaneous injection . These study suggest ultrasound may potential reference standard future evaluation ivWatch device .</detailed_description>
