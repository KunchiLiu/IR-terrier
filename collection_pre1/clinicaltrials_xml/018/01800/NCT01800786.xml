	<brief_summary>The overarch goal research propose test hypothesis ( ) pathophysiological mechanism OSA lead deterioration sleep-dependent memory consolidation across memory system , genetic marker APOε4 modulator , ( ii ) CPAP reverse measure memory deficit . In addition , explore aspect OSA ( e.g. , change sleep architecture , measure hypoxemia , EEG power spectrum ) likely impact sleep-dependent memory processing.To end , use specific cognitive task sleep-dependent memory consolidation process previously demonstrate group others . In addition , carry quantitative EEG power spectral analysis , delineate abnormal functioning brain region precision .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject selection General inclusion criterion : Men woman age 18 80 year old Good health determine medical psychiatric history physical examination An absence medical psychiatric disorder ( OSA treat hypertension ) could influence excessive daytime sleepiness The ability complete selfrating scale computerbased test Beck Depression Inventory score ≤16 Healthy control excluded Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) score &gt; 10/24 , OSA patient exclude randomization ESS score &gt; 18/24 . Subjects must agree abstain alcohol consumption day throughout Session 1 Session 2 . Criteria OSA patient : Newly diagnose OSA prior exposure CPAP Quantified apneahypopnea index great 5/hr ( AHI , define number apnea and/or hypopnea per hour sleep ) Subjects must agree limit alcohol use Session 1 Session 2 one few alcoholic drink daily 4 drink weekly Criteria Healthy control group : • Subjects match obstructive sleep apnea patient group age , race , body mass index , education intelligence ( WAIS full scale ) Subgroup selection : An additional subgroup OSA patient control , take antidepressant , recruit . Except current treatment antidepressant exclusion exclusion criterion apply . The following class antidepressant eligible : Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor Serotoninnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitor Noradrenergic specific serotonergic antidepressant Norepinephrinedopamine reuptake inhibitor Exclusion criterion ALL PARTICIPANTS : Potential participant ( OSA patient control ) exclude one follow condition find : Any history clinically significant , uncontrolled medical psychiatric condition ( treat untreated ) , OSA hypertension ( selfreport ) History serious heart disease renal failure ( selfreport ) History head injury ( selfreport ) Inability type ( e.g. , physical disability , arthritis ) exercise A lifetime history alcohol , narcotic drug abuse ( selfreport ) Use medication , overthe counter drug nutritional supplement know effect sleep , cognition and/or daytime vigilance ( selfreport ) Female subject pregnant take part study . If female subject becomes pregnant study , stop participation Presence follow sleep disorder : CheyneStokes breathe central sleep apnea ( &gt; 10 % event central ) ( screen sleep study ) Circadian rhythm disorder ( structure interview ) REM sleep without atonia REM behavior disorder ( structure interview screen sleep study ) Parasomnias ( structure interview ) PLMS index &gt; 15/h ( screen sleep study ) Insomnia ( structure interview 2 week sleep diary ) Narcolepsy ( structure interview ) Lefthandedness ( MSLT participant ) ( selfreport ) uncorrected vision impairment and/or visual field defect ( self report , screen examination )</criteria>
