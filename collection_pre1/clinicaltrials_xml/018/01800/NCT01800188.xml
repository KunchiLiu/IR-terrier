	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Disturbed glucose metabolism common feature patient end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) . Furthermore , prevalence diabetes mellitus ESRD population high result mark increased morbidity mortality . Several hormone responsible stable blood glucose include insulin , glucagon , gastrointestinal insulinotropic hormone Glucagon-like Peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) Glucose-dependent Insulinotropic Peptide ( GIP ) elevate dysregulated patient ESRD . Newly develop antidiabetic medication dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor ( DPP-4 inhibitor ) increase concentration hormone make effect treatment difficult predict patient ESRD . During history hemodialysis treatment refine increase removal various substance accumulate kidney function decline . The focus primary removal small molecule creatinine urea , recent decade focus move medium-sized molecule ( molecular weight 300 12,000 Da ) suspect cause various uremic complication amyloidosis neuropathy . The dialysis technique therefore optimize relatively large molecule remove , dialysis filter distinguish want unwanted substance . Thus , contrast functioning kidney risk remove important molecule include hormone , essential maintain normal glucose metabolism . Insulin , glucagon incretin hormone , GLP-1 GIP peptides molecular weight 3300 5800 Da . This mean theoretically size remove hemodialysis so-called high-flux filter hemodiafiltration , common standard care patient ESRD . It show insulin remove significant quantity hemodialysis , probably due adsorption filter filtration . Whether glucagon incretin hormone eliminate high effective hemodialysis hemodiafiltration never investigate . Previous study primarily observe unchanged glucagon GIP concentration blood conventional hemodialysis . One study show 30 % decrease GIP concentration hemodialysis , detect change probably reflect altered metabolism due treatment dialysis technique time inefficient remove peptide significantly . Assays analysis incretin hormone also become considerably specific differentiate active hormone inactive intermediate metabolite . In recent year grow development drug increase endogenous produce incretin hormone . Linagliptin , launch 2011 , one approve patient ESRD since clear renally therefore require change dosage . However , elimination incretin hormone dialysis patient sparingly studied dialysis treatment . This study determine effect high efficient dialysis treatment number hormone regulate blood glucose . Significant elimination hormone dialysis therapeutic implication treatment dialysis patient incretin base therapy . PURPOSE OF THE STUDY The purpose study determine whether several blood glucose-regulating hormone metabolite remove hemodialysis hemodiafiltration patient dialysis-dependent renal insufficiency . The hypothesis dialysis treatment result significant removal , thereby reduce plasma concentration hormone . METHODS 10 patient ESRD undergo either chronic hemodialysis chronic hemodiafiltration include . The study carry two separate day plan two day previous dialysis . On two study day participant treated 4 hour hemodialysis hemodiafiltration . Besides dialysis modality ( hemodialysis hemodiafiltration ) two study day alike . The participant examine morning 10 hour fast state ( include smoking ) without alcohol consumption within last 24 hour strenuous physical activity within last 2 hour . Weight , Height , blood pressure pulse measure dialysis access prepare . An initial blood sample analyze immediately sodium , bicarbonate ionized calcium dialysate dialyzer adjust match measure concentration close possible . The ultrafiltration set accord patient dry weight sodium ultrafiltration profile allow . The blood flow hold constant exceed half flow arteriovenous fistula . Each participant study day receive dialysis fast one hour standardize liquid meal 1.5 mg Paracetamol add administer . During dialysis blood sample measure repeatedly analyze insulin , glucagon , GLP-1 GIP . Blood sample draw dialysis filter calculate clearance sample spend dialysate collect determine amount adsorption hormone dialysis filter . Participants undergo optional third examination day receive standardize meal test without dialysis . Blood sample collect time interval examination day dialysis .</detailed_description>
