	<brief_title>Occupational Performance Coaching Stroke Survivors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Approximately 300,000 Canadians live effect stroke . Following hospital discharge , stroke survivor attempt return participation value activity quite challenge . In fact , majority stroke survivor , across disability level , report problem occupy time meaningful way . Current intervention enhance participation value activity limit study mixed result . This may due lack consideration important factor . As well , possible success limit yet efficient way provide kind long term , individualized support require successful return value activity . Effective efficient intervention must design build competence provide stroke survivor skills tool need allow plan manage return personally value activity several month recovery . Occupational Performance Coaching ( OPC ) new approach occupational therapy whereby individual guide solve problem critical achievement self-identified goal relate participation . OPC draw concept personal coaching , solution-focused therapy , problem solve intervention emotional support . A positive , strengths-based approach use promote patient self-efficacy self-management . This individualized approach provide time-limited intervention address current participation goal , allow individual develop skill address future participation goal . OPC test family child face challenge participate age appropriate activity test adult experience stroke . Following review literature , adaptation OPC stroke survivor ( OPC-Stroke ) develop emphasize individualized education metacognitive strategy goal set problem solving , broaden support consider beyond family . The purpose research explore effectiveness OPC-Stroke adult experience stroke examine feasibility acceptability research method preparation large randomize control trial ( RCT ) . This objective attain answer follow question : 1 . Do stroke survivor receive OPC-Stroke follow discharge community report increase participation compare receive standard care . 2 . Do stroke survivor receive OPC-Stroke follow discharge community report increase performance satisfaction individually identify participation goal , emotional wellbeing , goal self-efficacy , cognition mobility compare receive standard care ? 3 . What experience research participant receive OPC-Stroke ? 4 . Which components process OPC-Stroke promote achievement self-identified participation goal ? 5 . Are research procedure feasible implement acceptable participant therefore appropriate test OPC-Stroke large trial . Design This study use concurrent mixed method design pilot RCT embed qualitative study . The qualitative component study descriptive qualitative study goal explore experience participant receive OPC-Stroke provide insight component process OPC-Stroke promote goal achievement . Study Population Thirty-two stroke survivor discharge home acute stroke unit The Ottawa Hospital Bruyère in-patient stroke rehabilitation unit recruit study . Participants recruit time discharge hospital . The occupational therapist hospital screen potential participant refer potentially interested patient Research Assistant seek inform consent . Randomization Following consent participate research study completion initial outcome measure , participant allocate treatment control group use block randomization ( block size 4 ) . The randomization allocation process complete statistician contract Bruyère Research Institute ensure randomization adequate group allocation tamper . The OPC-Stroke intervention consist 10 face face visit occupational therapist train OPC 16 week period . Visits last approximately one hour . Since one secondary outcome change performance satisfaction individually-identified participation goal , participant receive first visit prior randomization . During visit coach use Personal Project Analysis tool combine Canadian Occupational Performance Measure ( COPM ) facilitate discussion reflection current participation activities/projects . Three personal project identify participant intervention goal , OPC-Stroke session focus project . Finally , first session participant score current performance satisfaction project use COPM ; well goal self-efficacy goal Intervention participant proceed directly receive OPC-Stroke intervention . As noted introduction , OPC-Stroke process goal-focussed problem solve collaborative performance analysis examine interaction person , environment task demand project/goal . Throughout process , coach provide emotional support promote exchange information . During final intervention visit , goal progress problem solve process review . Control Group The purpose control group study enhance internal validity include control change may occur passage time . This particularly relevant follow stroke course natural recovery adjustment may lead change participation . Therefore usual care option control group select . Usual care may consist limited outpatient therapy ( exclude occupational therapy ) and/or personal support service activity daily live .</detailed_description>
