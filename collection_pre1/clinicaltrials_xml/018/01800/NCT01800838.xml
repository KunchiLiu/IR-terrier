	<brief_title>Silicon Phthalocyanine 4 Photodynamic Therapy Stage IA-IIA Cutaneous T-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) utilize single treatment Pc 4-PDT ( silicon phthalocyanine 4 photo dynamic therapy ) subject mycosis fungoides ( MF ) /cutaneous T-cell lymphoma ( CTCL ) stage IA-IIA , evaluate accelerate dose escalation protocol consist single exposure PDT use topically-applied Pc 4 visible light wavelength 675 nm , follow assessment skin biopsy analyze cellular molecular change induced Pc 4-PDT . ( Cohort I ) II . Determine safety tolerability repeat light ( PDT ) exposures single application Pc 4 MF/CTCL plaque , use topically-applied Pc 4 visible light wavelength 675nm , follow assessment skin biopsy analyze cellular molecular change induced Pc 4-PDT . ( Cohort II ) III . Identification target assessment efficacy assist plan Phase II study . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive silicon phthalocyanine 4 topically undergo PDT . After completion study treatment , patient follow 24 hour , 1 week , 2 week , 30 day .</detailed_description>
