	<brief_summary>Activated prothrombin complex concentrate ( aPCC ) recombinant activate factor VII ( rFVIIa ) two drug available treat bleeds haemophilia A patient high titer inhibitor . However , management bleeds patient challenge due variation response lack standardized method monitor effect . We hypothesize significant increase whole blood clot stability could achieve tranexamic acid give concomitantly bypassing-agents thrombin generation remain unaffected . In prospective crossover study effect aPCC rFVIIa without TXA clot stability thrombin generation capacity ( ETP ) study , use thromboelastography ( ROTEM ) thrombin generation assay ( TGA ) , respectively . In addition , risk thrombosis disseminate intravascular coagulation ( DIC ) assess .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Study Bypassing Agent Therapy With Without Tranexamic Acid Haemophilia A Patients With Inhibitor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients receive first day aPCC ( 75IU/kg ) aPCC addition TXA ( 20mg/kg orally ) second day . After 14 day washout period crosse use rFVIIa ( 90 Âµg/kg ) otherwise experimental setup . Blood sample perform baseline , 15 , 30 , 60 , 120 , 180 240 minute post-treatment .</detailed_description>
