	<brief_summary>Leptin fat hormone act maintain energy balance . However , leptin level high obese subject indicate resistance action leptin . High leptin level associate increase cardiovascular metabolic risk , clear increase leptin leptin resistance contributes increase cardiovascular risk . Further , even though leptin receptor present fat tissue , leptin 's role fat tissue function completely investigated human . Based preliminary data investigator hypothesize resistance leptin action obese adipose tissue responsible alter expression adipose tissue protein contribute development cardiovascular metabolic dysfunction . To test hypothesis investigator propose novel study direct investigate leptin dependent change adipose tissue protein expression use adipose tissue obtain lean obese human subject</brief_summary>
