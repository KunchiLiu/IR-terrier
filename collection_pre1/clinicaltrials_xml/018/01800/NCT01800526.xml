	<brief_summary>Part 1 : A pilot study patient homozygous S ( HbSS ) hemoglobin S beta zero thalassemia ( HbS-βo thalassemia ) , aim examine effect intravenous NAC treatment plasma VWF parameter measure redox RBC function . Part 2 : A pilot study patient sickle cell disease admit hospital vaso-occlusive crisis determine effect NAC infusion plasma VWF parameter measure redox RBC function , measure pain hospital length stay .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study N-acetylcysteine Patients With Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two primary process dominate complication associate sickle cell disease ( SCD ) : vasoocclusion hemolysis . The plasma vessel wall adhesive protein von Willebrand factor ( VWF ) think involve process , strategy aim reduce secretion reactivity , could decrease complication patient SCD , test . Based prior study , N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) treatment may decrease VWF activity patient SCD may useful adjunctive treatment disorder . Part 1 enrolls stable outpatient homozygous S ( HbSS ) hemoglobin S beta zero thalassemia ( HbS-βo thalassemia ) , aim examine effect NAC treatment VWF parameter , measure oxidation RBC fragment . Patients receive IV NAC first 150 mg/kg 8 hour tolerate , later date 300 mg/kg 8 hour University Washington Clinical Research Center . Blood collect laboratory assessment . Subjects later offer enrollment oral phase . Part 2 , patient history vaso-occlusive crisis ( VOC ) approach outpatient set discus study . When admitted VOC , subject receive NAC IV infusion75 mg/kg every 6 hour 5 day . Blood laboratory assay collect morning pain assessment perform prior follow NAC infusion .</detailed_description>
