	<brief_summary>ASTHMA : Asthma chronic inflammatory disorder airways many different type cell , various cellular component . The chronic inflammation cause increase over-responsiveness airway , lead recurrent episode wheezing , breathlessness , chest tightness , cough , particularly night early morning hour . These episode , usually associate widespread variable block airway , usually reversible either spontaneously treatment . Asthma one common chronic disease worldwide , pose significant social burden child adult . It estimate 300 million people currently suffer asthma . The incidence asthma universal regardless level development country . There evidence last 20 year prevalence increase significantly , specially pediatric population . COPD : Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) major public health problem . It fourth lead cause chronic morbidity mortality United States heart disease , stroke acute respiratory infection , annual basis , disease robs live 3,000,000 people around u worldwide . The worrying impact steadily rise , dramatic increase frequency show 2020 disease third lead cause death . In Greece , 8.4 % population suffers COPD . Smoking lead cause COPD . However , smoker develop clinical picture COPD , suggest additional factor involve manifestation . Further investigation risk factor COPD , method reduce exposure agent molecular cellular mechanism involve pathogenesis remain major area research develop effective treatment reduce prevent development disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>ASTHMA TREATMENT : As regard pharmacological management asthma , inhaled corticosteroid ( eg budesonide , fluticasone beclomethasone ) underlie maintenance therapy , beta-2 agonist long-term preferred additional treatment . Other common medication systemic corticosteroid , beta-2-agonist short duration ( eg salbutamol ) oral beta2-agonists , long-lasting , methylxanthines , converter leukotrienes , color anticholinergic . The main clinical advantage transport deposition drug directly lungs associate safety efficacy : side effect associate systemic circulation zero , high concentration active substance directly attribute point action . Furthermore , onset action inhale beta2-agonist fast oral beta-2 agonist therapeutic response achieve faster . Finally , require low dos drug , due efficiency direct lung , reduce problem poor absorption metabolism liver . COPD TREATMENT : Effective management COPD involve four step : ( 1 ) assessment monitor disease , ( 2 ) minimize risk factor , ( 3 ) stabilization disease , ( 4 ) treatment exacerbation . ELPENHALER : A new multi-single dose inhale dry powder ( Elpenhaler Â® ) design , develop patent Elpen Pharmaceutical Co. Inc ( Pikermi , Greece ) . The new inhaler suitable performance range drug asthma , budesonide , formoterol fluticasone . OTHER TREATMENT APPROACHES : Most asthma medication administer form inhaler . There various form device facilitate administration inhale medication young child . The correct use inhaler drug important treatment asthma . If patient understand correct instruction , drug deposit satisfactorily lung , ie organ must act , remission . Furthermore inhaler incorrectly use much drug remain oral cavity pharynx therefore patient exposed adverse event drug treat properly asthma . Appropriate patient inhaler chosen attend physician , confirmation pilot demonstration site clinic , patient ( depend age ) understood apply device user . A new study conduct Center Capital allergies respiratory disease show 25 % asthmatic subject report inhaler empty asthma attack . The reason : `` There way someone see much medicine use inhaler continue blow air even empty , '' say Bradley Chips , lead author study . To save breath , look package leaflet number inhale dos contain .</detailed_description>
