	<brief_summary>The primary goal study examine impact vary supervision strategy clinician fidelity client outcomes community-based setting . Prior research establish training approach include period intervention-specific supervision consultation ineffective implementation effort include initial period supervision show eventual attenuation gain knowledge fidelity practice . Ongoing supervision may require effective sustained implementation evidence-based practice ( EBPs ) community-based setting . However , supervision one least investigated aspect train . `` Gold standard '' element supervision efficacy trial include review session , standardize procedure monitor client outcome model fidelity , ongoing skill-building ( e.g. , behavioral rehearsal ) . The degree ( e.g. , frequency , intensity ) strategy use community-based setting unknown . There grow number national statewide effort increase reach EBPs dissemination implementation initiative . There 18 statewide initiative implement Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ( TF-CBT ) , EBP child trauma exposure sequela . Many community base TF-CBT implementation effort , EBPs , include specific focus supervisor . However , limited scientific literature provide little guidance effort . Aims current trial include 1 ) study supervision exist implementation support ; particularly presence gold standard element ; 2 ) evaluate effect vary supervision strategy fidelity client outcome ; 3 ) test mediate effect treatment fidelity relationship supervision type client outcome . We propose two-phased , within-subjects subject design . In Phase I ( 9 month ) , examine supervision implementation support . In Phase II ( 30 month ) , examine two specific supervision condition , include vary EBP supervision element .</brief_summary>
