	<brief_title>Urinary NGF A Biomarker Acute Bacterial Cystitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recurrent UTI bothersome popular problem urogynecology clinical practice . According International Urogynecological Association ( IUGA ) /International Continence Society ( ICS ) joint report terminology female pelvic floor dysfunction , recurrent UTI define least three symptomatic medically diagnose UTI previous 12 month . The previous UTI ( ) resolve prior UTI diagnose . Recurrent UTI one common diagnose female pelvic floor dysfunction . Patients recurrent UTI might also bladder irritative symptom . Previous study reveal patient recurrent UTI elevate urinary NGF , suggest chronic inflammation present bladder patient resolution UTI . The investigator preliminary result show chronic inflammation , urothelial cell apoptosis impairment barrier function urothelial cell could underlie pathophysiology recurrent UTI woman . Chronic inflammation might reside bladder wall resolution UTI , might also cause urothelial dysfunction defective barrier function UTI easy recur patient . This evidence provide new focus clinical management future research recurrent urinary tract infection . Based knowledge , investigator hypothesize chronic inflammation might reside bladder wall , might also cause urothelial dysfunction defective barrier function . UTI might easy recur patient residual chronic bladder inflammation . If investigator determine complete resolution chronic inflammation acute cystitis episode , possible inhibit recurrent cystitis treat inflammation anti-inflammatory agent . Nerve growth factor ( NGF ) small secrete protein induces differentiation survival particular target neuron . NGF implicate chemical mediator pathology-induced change C-fiber afferent nerve excitability reflex bladder activity . The level neurotrophic factor include NGF increase bladder spinal cord injury ( SCI ) increase level NGF detect lumbosacral spinal cord dorsal root ganglion rat SCI . Chronic administration NGF bladder rat induces bladder hyperactivity increase fire frequency dissociate bladder afferent neuron . Increased level urinary NGF also detect BOO patient exhibit overactive bladder ( OAB ) symptom . Increased bladder tissue NGF note patient interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome ( IC/PBS ) . Recent research focus urinary NGF level detect OAB IC/PBS low urinary tract dysfunction ( LUTD ) . Evidences show urinary protein NGF prostaglandin E2 level increase patient OAB , sensory urgency detrusor overactivity ( DO ) . Patients OAB-dry OAB-wet significantly high urinary NGF level compare control group patient increase bladder sensation . The urinary NGF level increase physiologically small scale normal subject urge void increase pathologically large scale OAB patient small bladder volume urgency sensation . The urinary NGF level decrease antimuscarinic therapy decrease detrusor botulinum toxin injection refractory OAB . Put together , urinary NGF level seem potential biomarker diagnosis OAB underlie chronic inflammation . Several urological disease include bacterial cystitis , low ureteral stone urothelial cell carcinoma may develop storage symptom mimic OAB IC/PBS . The urinary NGF level also elevate disorder . In previous study investigator find UTI may increase NGF production urine associate urinary tract stone . Patients resolution UTI also persistent OAB may high urinary NGF level . These result provide evidence urinary NGF product inflammation urinary tract . Therefore , urinary NGF may consider second-line product follow urothelial damage change urothelial environment initiate sensory nerve excitation cause bladder hypersensitivity DO . Measuring urinary NGF non-invasive tool ass chronic inflammatory status longitudinal comparison treatment . It essential know whether urinary NGF level also increase acute cystitis episode production relation associate storage symptom different stage antibiotic treatment . This study design measure urinary NGF level patient acute cystitis different stage antibiotic treatment . If urinary NGF level association underlie inflammation bladder wall , investigator might use biomarker determine status resolution inflammation provide physician decide long investigator treat patient acute cystitis . Materials Methods This study enroll 30 female patient first time UTI 30 female patient recurrent UTI ( least two previous UTI episodes late 12 month ) recent acute episode . Ten age-matched woman ( 30 50 year old ) without prior history UTI urinary tract pathology invite serve control . Urine sample collect patient baseline , 7 day antibiotic treatment , 2 week , 4 week , 8 week , 12 week UTI episode . Urinalysis perform visit urine culture perform baseline 2 week 3 month visit . Urine sample baseline 3 month collect control comparison . All patient prove UTI detect pyuria urinalysis ( WBC &gt; 10 per high power field ) positive urine culture result . In addition , kidney , ureter , bladder ( KUB ) film , renal sonography perform exclude possibility urolithiasis urinary tract pathology . The one-day voiding diary request record visit determine functional bladder capacity ( FBC ) frequency episode per day . Bladder symptom record Overactive Bladder Symptom Score ( OABSS ) visual analog scale pain ( VAS ) . In addition , uroflowmetry , include maximum flow rate ( Qmax ) , void volume postvoid residual volume ( PVR ) also measure visit 2 . Urine sample baseline visit treatment collect comfortably full bladder send NGF measurement . Antibiotics ( Cephalexin 500mg Q6H ) 1 2 week start baseline urinalysis proven negative urine culture turn negative . Then antimicrobial agent ( Baktar 800mg h.s . ) anti-inflammatory agent ( Celecoxib 200mg QD ) randomly prescribe UTI prophylaxis 3 month complete resolution acute cystitis . All patient followed-up one year monitor whether occurrence recurrent UTI . All urine sample collect full bladder natural voiding . Measurement urinary NGF level perform ELISA method . Urine sample dilute . Voided urine put ice immediately centrifuge 3000 g 10 min 4 ◦C . The supernatant separate aliquot 1.5 mL tube preserve −80 ◦C freezer . At time , 3 mL urine take measure urinary creatinine level . Urinary NGF concentration determine use Emax ImmunoAssay System ( Promega , Madison , Wisconsin , USA ) specific highly sensitive ELISA kit , minimum sensitivity 7.8 pg/mL . The amount NGF urine sample fall detection limit NGF assay extract NGF standard curve . All sample run triplicate , urinary NGF level without consistent value three measure repeat value average . The total urinary NGF level normalize concentration urinary creatinine ( NGF/Cr level ) . The NGF/Cr level compare among subgroup . Statistical analysis perform paired t-test pair data consecutive time point . Mann-Whitney test use non-parametric analysis different subgroup . A P-value le 0.05 consider significant . Expected Results The investigator hypothesize patient recurrent UTI may persistently elevate urinary NGF level compare first time UTI . The urinary NGF level remain elevated patient persistent OAB symptom acute cystitis episode might persistently high control 3 month . Patients treat anti-inflammatory agent might lower urinary NGF level 3 month visit compare take antimicrobial . The incidence recurrent UTI follow one year might patient treat antimicrobial treat anti-inflammatory agent .</detailed_description>
