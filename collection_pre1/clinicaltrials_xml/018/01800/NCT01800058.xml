	<detailed_description>Prospective analysis biologic sample peripheral blood 65 patient localized high-risk PCa ( NCCN 2011 ) treat RTC-3D-IMRT combine AD . Following sign inform consent patient , blood sample analyze CTCs use immunomagnetic method base CellSearch system ( Veridex ) , 3 period time : 1. prior treatment ; 2. follow AD prior RT ; 3. follow end RT ( 1-3 month afterwards ) . Comparison expression CTCs peripheral blood follow AD RT perform . The quantification CTCs obtain phase treatment correlate treatment result term biochemical failure accord Phoenix definition , distant metastasis rate overall survival identify significant prognostic relationship determine potential effect treatment number CTCs Our work group include 65 patient amount base routine clinical activity safely enrol project development time participate center .</detailed_description>
