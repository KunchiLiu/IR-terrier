Research staff verify diagnosis ( MS , SCI , AMP , MD LBP ) prospective subject 'pre-verified ' one three way recruitment process : 1 . Research staff attempt determine whether subject University Washington Medical Center ( UWMC ) /Harborview Medical Center ( HMC ) medical record conduct simple search use secure application . If research staff unable locate medical record prospective subject recruitment strategy # 1 , individual part recruitment strategy # 4 ( i.e . individual see description study clinicaltrials.gov contact research staff ) , one two option pursue : 2 . Subjects ask initial screen process staff may review medical record receive service UWMC/HMC since diagnosis ; 3 . Subjects ask initial screen process staff may contact physician choice verify diagnosis ( ) receive service UWMC/HMC since diagnosis ; ( b ) refuse give staff permission review UWMC/HMC medical record ; ( c ) staff reason find UWMC/HMC medical record despite subject attest patient one time UWMC/HMC give staff permission review his/her record . Only individual whose diagnosis verify ( either via medical record review prior to/during screen verification via subject 's physician depend recruitment source ) proceed psychological screening assessment . Once prospective subject screen deem eligible participate , research staff arrange time date subject recruit study participate telephone psychological screening assessment one study 's licensed clinician ( Drs . Jensen , Ehde , Molton , Dillworth ) senior fellow ( Elena Mendoza , clinical psychologist ) . The study clinician ask potential subject question assess presence active suicidal ideation paranoid thought use assessment sheet . Individuals type thought eligible study . Individuals refer mental health professional need immediate attention . Research staff arrange time subject attend person call initial intake session . At begin initial intake session , research staff review consent form subject answer question he/she may . The subject complete sign consent form he/she would like participate . If subject decides enroll study , he/she ask complete set task test memory processing speed , participate relaxation hypnotic exercise , provide basic demographic information , well information diagnosis pain problem ( ) he/she experience . The initial intake session last 1.5 hour depend subject 's answer . The subject participate brain activity assessment Integrated Brain Imaging Center ( IBIC ) University Washington take one hour complete . The brain activity assessment consist electroencephalogram ( EEG ) , measure electrical activity brain electrode place scalp . There risk electrical shock . Research staff place damp electrode net subject 's head contain electrodes measure subject 's brain activity . EEG activity collect subject 's eye close . The research staff member collect data ask subject remain still possible assessment . A research staff member ask subject his/her pain intensity assessment .

The fourth longer assessment include question thing subject think pain , treatment pain subject receive , medication drug subject use , depressive symptom subject may experience . We also ask subject participate brain activity assessment follow end treatment .
