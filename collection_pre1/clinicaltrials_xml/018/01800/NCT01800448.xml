	<brief_summary>For critically ill patient , important know liberate mechanical ventilation ( removal breathe endotracheal tube extubation ) weaning ( progressive decrease amount support patient receive mechanical ventilation ) . It well recognize prolonged ventilation wean harm patient introduces significant increased cost health care system . The investigator objective improve safety removal life support critically ill patient harness information two new technology ; NM3 Nexus device . In particular , investigator interest pattern variation respiratory cardiac signal NM3 device , well monitor skin conductance Nexus device . The combination measure yet investigate date , could represent novel set measure use help physician well manage critically ill patient . The current standard care dictate patient consider candidate withdrawal ventilation , spontaneous breathe trial ( SBTs ) perform , degree ventilator support decrease , response observe help predict tolerate extubation . Health associate high degree variation physiologic parameter heart rate respiratory rate , illness &amp; stress associate loss variability . The analysis variability biological signal measure degree fluctuation present time . Previous study demonstrate change variability ( generally decrease ) observe illness state , degree change correlate illness severity . Several study report reduced heart respiratory rate variability ( HRV RRV ) SBTs associate extubation failure . Until recently , variability analysis traditionally do heart rate ( HRV ) , derive analyze beat-to-beat interval ubiquitous electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . The investigator aim apply variability analysis respiratory cardiac signal represent rich novel set muti-organ variability measure whose utility manage extubation ventilator wean investigated date .</brief_summary>
