	<brief_title>Optimal Vasopressor Titration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients admit intensive care unit ( ICU ) commonly suffer shock , condition cause life-threatening low blood pressure . Low blood pressure make difficult body deliver blood organ . The standard treatment doctor ICU use patient give medication help increase blood pressure . These medication call vasopressor . There side effect relate use vasopressor . The purpose research study determine well give vasopressor patient maintain high blood pressure target versus low blood pressure target . This study important information find help u know best administer vasopressor patient shock ICU .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1. Who receive vasopressor distributive shock 2. Who older 16 year age time eligibility . 3. Who direct care ICU team regardless location . 4. Who receive minimum 30 mL/kg intravenous fluid ( 2100 mL 70 kg patient ) enrolment OR responsible physician good reason believe fluid resuscitation longer require could harmful . 5. Who treat physician believe need vasopressor least 6 hour enrol . 1 . Have receive vasopressor 24 consecutive hour ; vasopressor discontinue &gt; = 2 hour restart vasopressor constitute distinct vasopressor episode clock reset . 2 . Are judged treat physician obvious cardiogenic shock acute myocardial infarction ( base new ST segment elevation ECG obvious echocardiographic finding ) . 3 . Have obvious haemorrhagic shock consequence clearly identify source blood loss . 4 . Require vasopressor cardiac surgery result cardiopulmonary bypassinduced hypotension . 5. Who specific indication catecholamine therapy shock ( i.e . angioedema intracranial hypertension ) . 6 . If attend team agree withhold withdraw life sustain care . 7 . Concurrent enrollment interventional trial meet guideline ( see ccctg.ca ) coenrollment ( coenrollment permissible potential interaction protocol ; address case case ) . 8 . Prior randomization study .</criteria>
