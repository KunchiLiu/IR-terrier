	<brief_summary>The goal proposal test implementation innovative approach improve health lower cost high risk population patient acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) immediately post-hospitalization . The investigator implement new service delivery approach provide foundation payment system reward keep high-risk patient healthy deploy technology health care workforce future implement prevention , care coordination , care process re-engineering , team-based care , use data support new care delivery model . This program focus coronary artery disease ( CAD ) , expect successful implementation model demonstrate sustainable pathway three-part aim CAD , many condition whose outcome highly sensitive post-discharge coordination . This proposal three main principle : 1 . Principles behavioral economics develop , refine , test past decade offer practical insight health behavior previously unavailable reflect exist care model . 2 . New technology , typically wireless device pill bottle , mobile telephone , make engagement patient substantially easy immediate ever . 3 . While randomized clinical intervention trial provide exceptional confidence comparative effectiveness narrow intervention , slow rigid dont reflect urgency health care transformation currently require . Principles rapid cycle innovation gain acceptance alternative supplement traditional method support evidence implementation success .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The specific aim study : 1 . Test effectiveness state-of-the-art web-based portal home-based wireless medication adherence device behavioral economic feedback mechanism prevent vascular event re-hospitalization 12 month follow hospital admission AMI 2 . Deploy new model evidence base evolutionary learning use rapid cycle innovation 3 successive planning cycle 36 month proposal Patients randomize 1 2 study group . 1 . The control group health insurance claim record analyze 12 month period comparison participant intervention arm . 2 . The intervention group : ( 1 ) use GlowCaps , remote monitor reminder pill bottle ; ( 2 ) assign engagement advisor study team ; ( 3 ) ask provide study team name contact information 3 family member friends support partner medication adherence ; ( 4 ) eligible daily sweepstakes-based engagement incentive eligibility win conditional medication adherence ; ( 5 ) choose modify preferences Way Health platform communication method study . The group receive program intervention also claim data analyze 12 month post-enrollment .</detailed_description>
