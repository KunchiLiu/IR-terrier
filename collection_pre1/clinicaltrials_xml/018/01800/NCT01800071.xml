	<brief_summary>This clinical study look vaccine call MVA-EBNA1/LMP2 . This new vaccine already study small number cancer patient . The vaccine design boost patient 's immunity common virus . The virus call Epstein Barr virus EBV . EBV sometimes find inside cancer cell commonly find nasopharyngeal cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase Ib Trial MVA-EBNA1/LMP2 Vaccine Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main aim clinical study find immune system respond vaccine , potential side effect vaccine effect give additional booster vaccination immune system . Approximately 18 patient EBV positive nasopharyngeal cancer ( NPC ) recruit trial . Patients receive four vaccination MVA-EBNA1/LMP2 vaccine . The first three vaccine give 3 weekly interval , follow fourth vaccine 12 week later . The vaccine give intradermal injection dose divide across multiple injection site arm , thigh . Patients participate study approximately 12 month first vaccination attend hospital approximately 11 time period . Standard safety assessment perform throughout trial clinic visit patient ask provide research blood sample . These sample use monitor effect vaccine patient 's immune system .</detailed_description>
