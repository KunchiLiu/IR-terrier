	<brief_summary>The prospect disease-modifying therapy pipeline Alzheimer 's Disease ( AD ) intensify effort use brain image effectively diagnosis monitoring dementing illness . There also emerge awareness destructive interplay AD Cerebrovascular Disease ( CVD ) age population ; disorder share common vascular risk factor may respond similar prevention treatment . Brain mapping technique capitalize fact different neurodegenerative disease target particular brain area . Brain shrinkage stroke disease quantify Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) use computerized analysis . This ongoing study applies advance MR image analysis , genetic test standardized cognitive functional assessment do yearly interval measure monitor longitudinal change patient AD , vascular neurodegenerative disease potentially measure modify effect emerge therapy . Over 1000 patient ( Mild Cognitive Impairment dementia AD , Vascular , Frontotemporal Lewy Body Disease ) 125 normal elderly already enrol , 150 autopsy . This study utilize specialize image analysis software package reliably quantify brain tissue volume small vessel disease , common type CVD . Results study help improve diagnosis , customize treatment , good monitor disease-modifying therapy currently investigation become applicable everyday practice .</brief_summary>
