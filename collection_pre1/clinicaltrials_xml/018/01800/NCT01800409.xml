	<brief_title>Abdominal Functional Electrical Stimulation Training Its Effect Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Respiratory infection lead cause morbidity mortality tetraplegic population . They often cause build secretion lung result unable generate effective cough . This inability cough lead many tetraplegic people require type intervention aid removal secretion . Manually assisted cough routine suction patient 's tracheostomy tube commonly use . Both technique associate problem : ( ) Tracheostomy suction uncomfortable often miss left bronchus , one contributing factor 80 % pneumonia occur leave lung spinal cord injure population . ( ii ) A manually assist cough safe effective procedure need provide trained care giver associate resource implication local health care provider . An alternative method help clear secretion improve ventilation Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation ( MI-E ) combination positive negative pressure apply user 's airway order induce cough . A number study show MI-E effective removing secretion reduce respiratory infection conventional suction manually assist cough technique , advantage secretion remove bronchi . MI-E also show significantly reduce length ICU stay reduce rate reintubation . Individuals tetraplegia reduce exhaled tidal volume ( VT ) reduce Cough Peak Flow ( CPF ) ( maximum air flow rate cough . The CPF value use ass risk respiratory infection , CPF &lt; 160 L/min associate functional cough high risk infection CPF &lt; 270 L/min suggest person able adequately clear secretion airway . The use MI-E therefore suggest anyone CPF &lt; 270 L/min . Functional Electrical Stimulation ( FES ) technique use make paralysed muscle contract . The effective contraction observe train electrical pulse apply close motor point paralyse muscle . When FES apply abdominal muscle call Abdominal Functional Electrical Stimulation ( AFES ) . AFES previously use increase VT CPF tetraplegic patient number study . MI-E routinely combine manually assist cough order loosen lung secretion increase user 's CPF . In way manually assist cough , AFES lead increase abdominal movement , result large CPF . During recent study investigator observe use AFES acute tetraplegic patient appear associate increase need secretion clearance , indicate AFES aid loosen lung secretion . Although abdominal movement achieve AFES typically significantly small achieve manually assist cough , may beneficial effect combination MI-E . In addition , AFES advantage apply consistently require less involvement caregiver . The investigator hypothesise ( ) maximal respiratory improvement due AFES training programme achieve 3 week training , ( ii ) combine use AFES MI-E may improve respiratory function ability clear secretion tetraplegic patient , result reduction number respiratory infection group . Methods Participants Ten tetraplegic participant recruit study . All participant inpatient Queen Elizabeth National Spinal Injuries Unit , Southern General Hospital , Glasgow . Experimental Procedures Each participant undergo pre study assessment . The study take form random crossover design involve four week control period eight week training period follow two week follow period . The order control training period randomise participant . If training period precedes control period follow period serve two week wash period avoid carryover acute effect train intervention . At pre study assessment , end every second week , participant take part assessment session . Pre study assessment Before study commences participant undergo pre study assessment also serve familiarisation session . Stimulation apply participant 's abdominal muscle test whether respond electrical stimulation . The optimum stimulation parameter ( electrode position/frequency/current pulsewidth ) require induce strong contraction abdominal muscle establish . These stimulation parameter use start point follow training assessment session . An assessment session , outline , conducted end pre study assessment . Training session Participants take part AFES training session five time per week ( Monday-Friday ) total 8 week . During session participant receive AFES 40 minute . Assessment session Each participant take part bi-weekly assessment session throughout study . At assessment session series Forced Vital Capacity ( FVC ) test perform without abdominal stimulation , provide measure participant 's Vital Capacity ( VC ) , Forced Exhaled Volume one second ( FEV1 ) Peak Expiratory Flow ( PEF ) . Respiratory flow volume measure use spirometer . To perform FVC manoeuver participant ask inhale Total Lung Capacity ( TLC ) exhale quickly fully . This repeated condition maximum 5 time , 3 attempt within 0.15L record . Many participant study FVC &lt; 1L . The ATS/ERS standard spirometry suggest FVC &lt; 1L range acceptable value plus minus 0.1L . All participant perform assessment sit upright position . The participant 's cough peak flow ( CPF ) also measure three condition : ( ) unassisted ( ii ) unassisted mechanical insufflation-exsufflation ( MI-E ) ( iii ) MI-E assist Abdominal Functional Electrical Stimulation ( AFES ) . To measure CPF , five cycle MI-E apply MI-E condition . The maximum CPF value record five attempt take participant 's CPF condition . During pre study assessment end training control period extend assessment session perform . The additional measurement ( ) MI-E manually assist cough , ( ii ) ultrasound measurement diaphragm movement without AFES . The CPF achieve use MI-E manually assist cough record manually assist cough apply patient 's regular caregiver , caregiver apply manually assist cough three session . The movement diaphragm measure FVC manoeuvre use ultrasound probe , without AFES assistance . This allow evaluation effect AFES diaphragm movement . Follow up/ Wash period After train period participant undergo two week follow period . If participant still complete control period follow also act wash . During wash period participant undergo training session . The aim wash period minimise effect acute response training period control period .</detailed_description>
