	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether medication block effect hormone progesterone ( CDB-4124 Proellex ) decrease growth rate breast cancer cell compare placebo . CDB-4124 ( also call Proellex ) medication work hormone , progesterone . The researcher study would like compare change breast cancer cell woman take CDB-4124 prior surgery woman take placebo pill prior surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Oral CDB-4124 v . Placebo Stage I-II Primary Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To test hypothesis treatment selective progesterone receptor modulator ( SPRM ) CDB-4124 ( telapristone acetate ) anti-tumor effect woman early-stage breast cancer , define significant decrease tumor proliferation ( Ki67 label index ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Measure change apoptosis use IHC ( cleave caspase 3 TUNEL ) . II . Measure change blood estradiol progesterone level . III . Compare breast tissue concentration CDB-4124 metabolite ( CDB4453 ) plasma concentration end therapy . IV . Assess adverse event . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Measure protein expression relate target ( include estrogen receptor alpha ( ERA ) , estrogen receptor beta ( ERB ) , progesterone receptor isoforms progesterone receptor alpha [ PRA ] , progesterone receptor beta [ PRB ] , tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily , member 11a , NFKB activator [ RANK ] , tumor necrosis factor ( ligand ) superfamily , member 11 [ RANKL ] , either cyclin-dependent kinase 2 [ cdk2 ] cyclin-dependent kinase 4 [ cdk4 ] , ) use IHC baseline treatment . II . Perform ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) microarray analysis compare tumor normal tissue intervention control group . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive telapristone acetate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 2-10 week undergo surgical resection . ARM II : Patients receive placebo orally daily 2-10 week undergo surgical resection . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 month .</detailed_description>
