	<brief_summary>Although half patient HF normal ejection fraction slightly alter ( HF-PEF ) prognosis differs little reduced ejection fraction , pathophysiology HF-PEF still poorly understood . Sodium restriction common measure self-care orient HF patient management congestive episode . The role orientation treatment patient preserve ejection fraction , however , still unclear . The evaluation effect sodium restriction neurohormonal activation episode decompensation HF-PEF promote well understanding pathophysiological progression complex syndrome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Dietary Sodium Restriction Management Patients With Heart Failure Diastolic Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , parallel trial blind outcome assessment . The sample include adult patient ( age â‰¥18 year ) diagnosis HF-PEF admit HF decompensation . The patient randomize receive diet sodium fluid intake restrict 0.8 g/day 800 mL/day respectively ( intervention group ) unrestricted diet , 4 g/day sodium unlimited fluid intake ( control group ) , follow 7 day hospital discharge . The primary outcome shall consist weight loss 7 day discharge . The secondary outcome include assessment clinical stability , neurohormonal activation , daily perception thirst readmission rate 30 day .</detailed_description>
