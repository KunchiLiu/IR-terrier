	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea hypertension well-known cardiovascular risk factor . Their control could reduce burden heart disease across population . There several drug control hypertension , consistently beneficial treatment reduce apneas continuous positive airway pressure . The demonstration one drug could improve sleep apnea hypertension would support novel approach treatment disease . The role fluid retention sleep apnea know several decade . The role diuretic well establish hypertension never appropriately tested sleep apnea . Besides test efficacy drug , study help understand mechanism link hypertension sleep apnea treatment .</brief_summary>
