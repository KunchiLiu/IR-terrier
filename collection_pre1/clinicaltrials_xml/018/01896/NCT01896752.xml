	<brief_title>Renal Hepatic Clearance Following High-Dose Methotrexate Childhood ALL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Due optimization dose intensity conventional anticancer drug combine early risk group classification clinical trial cure rate childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) beyond 80 % . Methotrexate ( MTX ) one important drug treatment ALL key component treatment phase . Infusions high-dose methotrexate ( HDMTX ) use many treatment protocol ALL optimal dose infusion time remain undefined . The systemic clearance MTX exhibit large inter- intra-individual variability cause several clinical problem . Fast MTX clearance associate increase risk relapse , whereas patient slow MTX clearance side effect . In situation extremely low MTX clearance necessary administer high dos leucovorin order minimize toxicity ; unfortunately treatment antidote potentially rescue cancer cell thereby increase risk relapse . Therapy high-dose MTX would improve substantially possible predict clearance MTX patient use tailor individualized dose drug . However , 3.7 , 0.2 , 2 % inter-individual variation MTX clearance explain age , gender ancestry , respectively . Genetic variation seem explain 10 % difference , SNPs gene encode transporter protein ( e.g . reduce folate carrier anion transporter 1B1 , OATP1B1 ) suggest particularly large impact . A serious limitation , however , SNPs difficult use prediction MTX pharmacokinetics intra-individual variation MTX clearance show six fold . In order use genetic variation clinically set necessary reduce large intra-individual clearance MTX . The intra-individual variation MTX clearance relate renal function large amount HDMTX dose also enter liver , metabolize 7-hydroxy MTX probably also undergoes enterohepatic circulation . Additionally , insignificant amount MTX degrade inactive metabolite 4-amino-4-deoxy-N-methylpteroic acid ( DAMPA ) . In order determine whether renal hepatic function responsible large intra-individual variation MTX clearance urinary excretion MTX liver metabolite 7-hydroxy MTX study , model apply predict individual time span complete MTX excretion reveal early pharmacogenetic/kinetic pattern predictive elimination MTX HDMTX course child ALL .</detailed_description>
