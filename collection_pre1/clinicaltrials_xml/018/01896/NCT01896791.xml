	<brief_summary>Climacteric Menopausal Transition define time period change non-reproductive reproductive life , extension variable length . During period , establishment Menopause non-functioning ovarian , appearance various symptom express depletion ovarian follicle common ; among symptom , frequently report woman vasomotor symptom hot flash . In addition hormonal therapy , medication employ attempt improve symptom ; although present good result placebo , yet little clinical impact reduce vasomotor symptom . Therefore , gap allow evaluation alternative therapy , Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) . The rationale study effect technique context possible autonomic modulatory effect . What reinforce choice technique fact demonstrate efficacy pathology depression , pain , Parkinson 's disease , among others . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) renew method non-invasive brain modulation . It base transcranial application weak direct current non-invasive , simple painless manner . Its use treatment vasomotor symptom study . The objective study evaluate improvement vasomotor symptom postmenopausal woman , application tDCS , compare control group . This Randomized Clinical Trial hold female postmenopausal patient , follow outpatient Menopause Clinic Obstetrics Gynecology Service , Hospital de Clinicas de Porto Alegre . From result , expect present new therapeutic option treatment vasomotor symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Outcome : evaluate effect tDCS vasomotor symptom postmenopausal woman treat tertiary hospital southern Brazil . Secondary Outcome : compare effect tDCS sham-tDCS postmenopausal woman vasomotor symptom , FSH ( Follicle Stimulating Hormone ) level , salivary cortisol , BDNF ( Brains derive neurotrophic factor ) level , depressive symptom quality life . Interventions : - Application tDCS period 10 consecutive day . - Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) : Active stimulation : anode electrode place area motor cortex M1 C3 C4 position dominant hemisphere ( International 10-20 EEG System ) . The cathode electrode place contralateral supraorbital region anode electrode . Treatment time intensity stimulus : 2 mili Ampere , 20min , 10 day . Placebo-sham : appliance entire period without active stimulation , position electrode sit active stimulation . The placebo group receive pharmacological treatment research . After treatment , patient reassess week , month three month new application questionnaire sample collection .</detailed_description>
