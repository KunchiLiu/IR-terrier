	<brief_summary>Background : - A small brain protein call metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 ( mGluR5 ) may affect several brain disease autism depression . Researchers use 2 radioactive chemical ( [ 11C ] SP203 [ 11C ] FPEB ) research drug ( STX107 ) attach receptor , figure best way use positron emission tomography ( PET ) see mGluR5 receptor . They use scan monitor radioactivity go . Objectives : - To find best way image mGluR5 receptor brain . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer age 18 55 . Design : - All participant screen medical exam visit 1 . In late visit , may PET scan , two small tube place skin lie scanner . They may MRI scan , lie scanner . - Part 1 participant 2 visit . They PET brain scan use [ 11C ] FPEB blood drawn . Then MRI brain scan . - Part 2 participant 1 visit , whole body PET scan use [ 11C ] FPEB blood drawn . - Part 3 participant 4 visit , include 1 overnight stay hospital . Over visit , 4 PET scan 1 MRI brain scan . They receive research drug injection chemical . Blood drawn scan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Multiple PET ligand exist image metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 ( mGluR5 ) . The selection best PET ligand image mGluR5 necessary large clinical study patient population choose ligand likely difficult radioligands evaluate different condition different subject population . The purpose study determine best PET ligand image mGluR5 receptor brain healthy subject . This accomplish measure mGluR5 receptor occupancy subject use two PET ligand high affinity mGluR5 [ ( 11 ) C ] SP203 [ ( 11 ) C ] FPEB , use STX107 , negative allosteric modulator mGluR5 receptor block radioligand brain uptake . The two radioligands choose among many base recommendation mGluR5 work group . Two serial PET scan use [ ( 11 ) C ] SP203 [ ( 11 ) C ] FPEB perform baseline condition one day receptor block condition another day . As [ ( 11 ) C ] FPEB evaluate human , plan acquire brain whole-body dosimetry scan measure receptor occupancy . Furthermore , wish compare FPEB label ( 11 ) C ( 18 ) F subject -two brain PET scan use [ ( 11 ) C ] FPEB [ ( 18 ) F ] FPEB do serially subject day . FPEB label ( 11 ) C structure FPEB label ( 18 ) F therefore expect yield similar binding measure . Study population : 55 healthy volunteer age 18 55 year . Design : To characterize brain uptake distribution radioligand , initial cohort healthy volunteer ( n = 10 ) undergo brain PET scan use [ ( 11 ) C ] FPEB . To estimate radiation absorb dos [ ( 11 ) C ] FPEB , cohort healthy volunteer ( n = 10 ) undergo whole-body PET PET/CT scan . A subsequent cohort healthy volunteer ( n = 15 ) two scan session : ) baseline i.e. , medication-free b ) block i.e . medication . Each scan session two serial PET scan : [ ( 11 ) C ] FPEB [ ( 11 ) C ] SP203 day ( scan morning afternoon ) . The block session administration STX107 , time also measure concentration STX107 plasma . Both scanning session would include arterial line measurement input function parent radioligand separate radiometabolites well plasma free fraction radioligand . We plan study two dos STX107 , three five subject dose . The blockade brain uptake [ ( 11 ) C ] FPEB [ ( 11 ) C ] SP203 plot function plasma concentration STX107 . A cohort healthy volunteer ( n = 15 ) undergo two serial brain PET scan [ ( 11 ) C ] FPEB [ ( 18 ) F ] FPEB day ( one scan morning , afternoon ) . Outcome measure : The radioligands evaluate three criterion : 1 . Peak brain uptake . Higher uptake well , provide robust signal image long time . 2 . Time-stability distribution volume . If measurement receptor binding ( i.e. , distribution volume ) stable increase lengths imaging , result good consistent lack radiometabolites brain . 3 . Ratio specific non-displaceable uptake brain . The receptor occupancy study analyzed so-called Lassen plot calculate non-displaceable ( free radioligand plus non-specifically bound ) uptake brain . The good radioligand well ratio signal noise , case ratio specific nondisplaceable uptake .</detailed_description>
