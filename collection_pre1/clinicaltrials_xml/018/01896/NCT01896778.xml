	<brief_title>Body Warming Improving Blood Flow Oxygen Delivery Tumors Patients With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility efficacy 2 different Body Warming Alter ( Thermo ) Regulation Microenvironment ( B-WARM ) regimens alter tumor blood flow patient variety malignancy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine duration thermal dose B-WARM change duration extent tumor blood flow change patient variety malignancy . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1of 2 arm . ARM I : Patients undergo B-WARM 39 degree Celsius ( C ) 30 minute . ARM II : Patients undergo B-WARM 39 degree C 2 hour . After completion study , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
