	<brief_summary>Early stage hormone receptor positive breast cancer typically treat adjuvant endocrine therapy order decrease risk breast cancer recurrence improve overall survival disease . Typical agent use treatment include tamoxifen aromatase inhibitor . In postmenopausal woman , aromatase inhibitor therapy increasingly common associate few long-term serious toxicity compare tamoxifen . However , aromatase inhibitor cause arthralgias 40-50 % patient , influence adherence therapy lead treatment discontinuation minority case . The mechanism underlie development toxicity remain unclear , predictor develop symptom remain undefined . Initial report suggest grip strength decrease aromatase inhibitor therapy , body-mass index may influence development symptom . Therefore , longitudinal study develop determine change grip strength time woman treat aromatase inhibitor tamoxifen , well identify potential association change grip strength BMI . Patient self-reported symptom also collect . A total 115 woman early stage breast cancer initiate therapy either aromatase inhibitor tamoxifen enrol .</brief_summary>
