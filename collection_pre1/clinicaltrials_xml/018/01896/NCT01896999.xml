	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) combination brentuximab vedotin ipilimumab , brentuximab vedotin nivolumab , brentuximab vedotin , ipilimumab , nivolumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate complete response ( CR ) rate , partial response ( PR ) rate overall response rate ( ORR ) , combination brentuximab vedotin ipilimumab , brentuximab vedotin nivolumab , brentuximab vedotin , ipilimumab , nivolumab . II . To evaluate duration remission ( DOR ) combination compare DOR achieve recent prior systemic therapy . III . To evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) patient receive combination brentuximab vedotin ipilimumab , brentuximab vedotin nivolumab , brentuximab vedotin , ipilimumab , nivolumab . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate ability combination alter tumor specific T cell immunity . II . To evaluate effect combination systemic immunity . III . To evaluate panel cytokine T cell specific biomarkers peripheral blood potential immune signature treatment response therapy combination patient relapsed/refractory Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) . IV . To evaluate use gene expression profile ( GEP ) signature response novel combination antibody drug conjugate immunomodulatory therapy . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study ipilimumab nivolumab . Patients assign 1 3 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously ( IV ) 90 minute day 1 course 1-4 , 8 , 12 , 16 brentuximab vedotin IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 16 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive brentuximab vedotin IV 90 minute nivolumab IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 16 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive nivolumab IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 30 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM III : Patients receive ipilimumab IV 30 minute day 1 course 1 every 12 week 9 dos . Patients receive brentuximab vedotin IV 90 minute day 1 nivolumab IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment brentuximab vedotin nivolumab repeat every 21 day 16 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients receive nivolumab IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 30 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically 3 year .</detailed_description>
