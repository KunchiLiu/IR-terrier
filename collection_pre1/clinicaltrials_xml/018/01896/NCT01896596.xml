	<brief_summary>In UK , infant currently receive 5-in-1 vaccine ( Pediacel ) 2 , 3 4 month age , protect diphtheria , tetanus , pertussis ( whooping cough ) , polio Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) . Infants also routinely receive meningococcal group C vaccine ( MenC ) 3 4 month 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine ( Prevenar13 ) 2 4 month age . This study aim offer infant 6-in-1 vaccine ( Infanrix-Hexa ) also help protect hepatitis B alongside routine vaccination UK infant immunisation schedule ass immune response different vaccine . Hepatitis B virus infects liver usually affect adult , child infect close contact carrier virus . Children hepatitis B infection may symptoms many year may go develop liver failure , cirrhosis cancer . Many country already use Infanrix-Hexa study undertaken help decide whether UK . Babies take part study receive Infanrix-Hexa instead Pediacel . All vaccine give routine schedule include one MenC vaccine instead 2 dos UK infant immunisation schedule soon go change baby receive one MenC vaccine 3 month age . There currently several license MenC vaccine give baby . In order check whether difference protection , baby take part randomly receive one 3 MenC-containing vaccine : NeisVacC , Menjugate Menitorix . Studies already show one dose Neis-Vac Menjugate give baby 3 month provide similar protection MenC infection two dos give 3 4 month . Menitorix protect Hib MenC , baby group receive MenitorixTM extra dose Hib also include Infanrix-Hexa might lower antibody response MenC compare two MenC vaccine , although infant well-protected 12-month booster vaccination , also contain Menitorix .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Infants United Kingdom routinely immunise diphtheria , tetanus , pertussis ( whooping cough ) , polio Haemophilus influenzae type b ( Hib ) single 5-in-1 ( DTaP5-IPV-Hib ) combination vaccine give 2-3-4 month schedule . They also receive vaccine Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C ( MenC ) 3 month 13 pneumococcal serotypes ( PCV13 ) 2-4 month . From 01 July 2013 , infant also receive oral rotavirus vaccine 2 3 month age . Combination vaccines reduce number injection administer infant , therefore , minimise number visit general practitioner , time , improve compliance , parental satisfaction cost-effectiveness vaccination programme . The development manufacture combination vaccine , however , complex possible interaction different antigen , carrier protein adjuvant use vaccine . Administration Hib conjugate vaccine part diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis ( DTP-Hib ) combination result much low Hib antibody concentration compare Hib conjugate vaccine administer separately ( Eskola et al. , 1996 ; Schmitt et al. , 1998 ; Schmitt et al. , 2000 ) . Similarly , immunogenicity Hib component combination vaccine contain acellular pertussis ( DTaP-Hib ) significantly low compare contain whole cell pertussis ( DTwP-Hib ) ( Bar-On et al. , 2009 ) . Interactions also occur vaccine give visit ( Dagan et al. , 2008 , Borrow et al , 2011 ) . Vaccines use diphtheria mutant toxin ( CRM197 ) primary carrier protein , example , show interfere immune response Hib component combination vaccine dose-dependent manner , even vaccine administer different limb . On hand , MenC vaccine use tetanus carrier protein ( e.g . NeisVac-C™ ) may enhance immune response Hib component combination vaccine . In UK , current acellular-pertussis-containing 5-in-1 combination vaccine ( DTaP5/Hib/IPV ; Pediacel™ ) extremely effective maintain control diseases aim prevent . In particular , control invasive Hib disease best achieve since introduction routine Hib vaccination almost 20 year ago ( HPR , 2011 ) . IMMUNISATION AGAINST HEPATITIS B Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection major global problem . HBV highly infectious transmit mainly sexual intercourse , perinatal transmission childbirth , inject drug use blood-to-blood contact ( National disease surveillance centre , 1988 ) . HBV cause acute chronic infection . Most burden HBV infection due chronic infection , may asymptomatic many year associate increase long-term risk cirrhosis hepatocellular carcinoma ( Beasley , 1988 ) . The risk chronic HBV infection inversely related age , 90 % infected childhood develop chronic infection compare &lt; 10 % among infected adult ( Edmunds et al. , 1993 ; Kane , 1995 ; McMahon et al. , 1985 ; Medley et al. , 2001 ) . Because high global burden chronic nature disease , WHO recommend country include hepatitis B vaccine national immunisation programme ( World Health Organization , 1992 ) . By 2008 , 177 country introduce routine neonatal , infant and/or adolescent vaccination national immunisation programme ( World Health Organization , 2009 ) . The UK , however , adopt selective HBV immunisation strategy target infant bear carrier mother &amp; close family member , individual change sexual partner frequently , inject drug user , prisoner , individual frequent exposure blood ( include healthcare worker ) certain high-risk patient group ( Department Health , 2006 ) . The recent data base national epidemiology laboratory surveillance acute HBV infection suggest risk acquire infection within UK low , 512 acute probable acute case report 2010 England ( rate 0.99 per 100,000 population ) , mainly adult ( Health Protection Agency , 2011 ) . A recent cost-effectiveness analysis estimate introduction HBV vaccine UK infant immunisation programme could prevent 81 % HBV-associated morbidity mortality cost £260,000 per QALY gain ( Siddiqui et al. , 2010 ) . An adolescent vaccination programme less effective , 45 % morbidity prevent cost £493,000 per QALY gain ( Siddiqui et al. , 2010 ) . For UK , threshold cost per vaccinate child universal infant vaccination programme would consider cost-effective less £4.09 , indicate clearly HBV vaccine could realistically consider cost-effective UK immunisation programme part combination vaccine ( Siddiqui et al. , 2010 ) . There concern , however , two Hepatitis B-containing combination vaccine - DTaP/Hib/IPV/HepB ( Infanrix- Hexa™ , GSK Biologicals , Rixensart , Belgium ) DTa3P-HBV-IPV ( Infanrix-Penta , GSK Biologicals , Rixensart , Belgium ) - currently license UK produce low Hib antibody level compare Pediacel™ could result another Hib resurgence observe UK decade ago ( see ) . THE INFANRIX-HIB™ VACCINE In UK , late 1999 mid-2002 , around 50 % infant receive previously license DTa3P-Hib ( Infanrix-Hib™ , GSK Biologicals , Rixensart , Belgium ) combination vaccine contain three-component acellular pertussis vaccine ( a3P ) supplement shortage DTwP-Hib supply . This vaccine know produce low Hib antibody concentration comparison DTwP-Hib vaccine , although difference consider clinically significant ( Goldblatt et al. , 1999 ; Eskola et al. , 1999 ) . In 2000 , however , number invasive Hib case UK increase , particularly among previously vaccinate toddler ( McVernon et al. , 2003 ) . Possible reason resurgence include great expect decline protective Hib antibody concentration primary infant immunisation without booster second year life wan herd protection offer initial catch-up campaign ( Ladhani et al. , 2008 ) . However , temporary use less immunogenic Infanrix-Hib™ vaccine also contribute observed increase case . A UK case-control study compare vaccine failure case period healthy child bear day find receipt dose Infanrix-Hib™ compare DTwP-Hib infant primary schedule result increase risk vaccine failure result invasive Hib disease ( trend per dose : 1.87 ; 95 % CI , 1.46- 2.40 ; P &lt; 0.001 ) ( McVernon et al. , 2003 ) . This observation subsequently confirm study ( Johnson et al. , 2006 ; McVernon et al. , 2008 ) . The response increase Hib case include suspend use Infanrix-Hib™ favour DTwP-Hib , 2003 , implementation Hib booster campaign child age &gt; 6 month &lt; 4 year , cohort would receive Infanrix-Hib™ infancy ( Ladhani et al. , 2008 ) . In September 2004 , combination vaccine use routine infant immunisation change DT-aP5/Hib/IPV ( Pediacel™ ) , include five acellular pertussis antigen ( aP5 ) , head-to-head comparison DTwP-Hib administer 2-3-4 month UK schedule show marginally low Hib antibody concentration Pediacel™ ( Kitchin et al. , 2007 ) . Moreover , September 2006 , routine Hib booster dose ( give combine Hib-MenC , Menitorix™ , GSK Biologicals , Rixensart , Belgium ) add childhood immunisation programme 12 month age . Since 2007 , Hib case start decline . In 2010 , 30 case invasive Hib disease , 6 case child age &lt; 5 year Hib-related death age group since 2007 ( HPR , 2011 ) . NEWER INFANRIX™ VACCINES Although Infanrix-Hib™ longer available , currently license Infanrix-Penta™ Infanrix-Hexa™ share antigens . Therefore , reasonable concern re-introduction Infanrix™-based combination vaccine might adversely impact current excellent control invasive Hib disease UK . There , however , indirect data , yet , unpublished study conduct European country 3-4-5 3-5 month immunisation schedule suggest inclusion IPV Infanrix-Hib® improve immunogenicity Hib component , addition HepB appear significant impact Hib immunogenicity ( Dagan et al. , 2008 ) . On hand , immunogenicity data Infanrix™-based Hib combination vaccine consistently low UK study compare country . It likely multiple factor , include accelerate infant schedule ( 2-3-4 month ) absence booster dose Hib second year life , contribute loss control Hib disease UK . In Republic Ireland , use Infanrix-Hib-IPV™ 2-4-6 month schedule without booster dose may also contribute increase invasive Hib disease ( Fitzgerald et al. , 2005 ; Fitzgerald &amp; Cotter , 2007 ) . More recent manufacturer-sponsored study suggest Infanrix-Hexa™ may provide adequate Hib response 2-3-4 month schedule , although none study take place UK . In two reported study , however , immunogenicity Infanrix™-based Hib vaccine half Pediacel . Other EU country use Infanrix™-based vaccine experience major increase Hib incidence . In Germany , Infanrix™-based vaccine use 2-3-4 month schedule booster dose 11-14 month decade , control invasive Hib disease remain good . Studies vaccine effectiveness period August 2000 December 2004 estimate protection 90.4 % ( 95 % CI : 70.6-96.8 ) full primary series ( Kalies et al. , 2008 ) . However , infant Germany rarely receive immunisation schedule . The median age first dose , third dose booster immunisation 3.3 , 6.0 14.4 month respectively , year Infanrix-Hexa™ routinely use ( Kalies et al. , 2006 ) . Such difference vaccination schedule , along difference Hib epidemiology different surveillance method use mean German experience may applicable UK . CHOICE OF MENC VACCINE The UK Joint Committee Vaccination Immunisation ( JCVI ) recently recommend reduce infant MCC schedule single dose infancy add extra MCC dose adolescent immunisation schedule ( JCVI , 2011 ) . There currently two MCC conjugate vaccine use UK - NeisVac-C™ ( use tetanus toxoid carrier protein ) Menjugate™ ( use CRM carrier protein ) suitable use single dose prim schedule ( Findlow et al. , 2012 ) . Tetanus-based MCC vaccine ( MCC-TT ) improve immunogenicity Hib component combination vaccine ( Tables 2 &amp; 3 ) , also result high MenC primary booster response compare MCC-CRM vaccine UK accelerate immunisation schedule ( Southern et al. , 2009 ; Kitchin et al. , 2007 ) . If give concomitant MCC-TT containing vaccine , therefore , Infanrix-Hexa™ may provide good Hib antibody response UK 2-3-4 month schedule . NeisVac-C™ available MCC-TT vaccine show adequately immunogenic give single dose 3 month age Pediacel™ ( DTaP5/Hib/IPV ) vaccine ( Findlow et al. , 2009 ) . Use single dose combine MCC-TT/Hib-TT vaccine ( Menitorix™ ) currently use routine 12-month booster UK , would attractive alternative . Although Menitorix™ contain less MenC antigen vaccine , therefore , may induce good post-primary antibody response single dose NeisVac-C™ possibly even Menjugate™ , antibody response routine 12-month booster dose Menitorix™ likely satisfactory may better booster response prim Menjugate™ ( Findlow et al. , 2012 ) . The aim study , therefore , evaluate immunogenicity Infanrix-Hexa™ give 2-3-4 month schedule PCV13 2-4 month incorporate random study three different MCC vaccine ( Menjugate™ , NeisVac-C™ Menitorix™ ) give 3 month age .</detailed_description>
