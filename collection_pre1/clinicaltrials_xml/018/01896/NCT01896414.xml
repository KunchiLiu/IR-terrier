	<brief_summary>The metabolic syndrome raise risk heart disease currently epidemic proportion U.S . It consist 3 follow component : central obesity , high triglyceride , low HDL , abnormal blood pressure impair fast glucose level . Previous study suggest omega-3 fish oil may influence component mechanisms involve well understood . Therefore , proposal investigate omega-3 fish oil affect inflammation , lipid fat breakdown compare placebo . Favorable outcome study could translate new approach improve heart disease risk men woman metabolic syndrome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Metabolic Actions Omega-3 Fatty Acids Inflammation Adipocyte Lipolysis Metabolic Syndrome Epidemiological study identify metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) biomarker cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk , recent AHA scientific statement recommend intensive lifestyle diet exercise measure reduce risk . Marine-derived omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid , eicosapentanoic acid ( EPA ) improve many constituent metabolic syndrome lower fast TG glucose level , inflammation , insulin resistance blood pressure . These improvement may mediate increase fat cell storage metabolism lipid , reduce inflammation ectopic fat deposition visceral abdominal tissue , muscle liver result excessive pro-inflammatory intra-abdominal fat ( IAF ) , insulin resistance reduce level HDL cholesterol , hallmark characteristic MetS . The anti-inflammatory action EPA low acute phase reactant ( APRs ) proinflammatory mediator mechanisms lipid lower insulin sensitize effect reduce CVD risk . The systematic investigation marine-derived omega-3 PUFAs inflammatory , metabolic physiological parameter provide new mechanistic insight therapeutic use potentially beneficial , safe nutraceutical , EPA patient MetS . Thus , hypothesis supplementation marine-derived omega-3 PUFAs , reduce constituent MetS well systemic tissue inflammation , insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) , adipocyte lipolysis cytokine release AT enhance TG storage capacity subcutaneous AT . The reduction inflammation increase insulin sensitivity remodel adipose tissue function efficiently TG uptake storage ; thus , reduce circulate FFAs cytokine . We postulate metabolic effect may decrease ectopic fat deposition viscera ( IAF muscle ) , intrigue , novel outcome provide rationale 9 month treatment . The Specific Aims conduct pilot 9 month randomize trial adult high Tg least one component MetS compare effect EPA vs. placebo : Aim 1 : Metabolic ( e.g. , lipoproteins , inflammatory cytokine , acute phase reactant , glucose tolerance/insulin resistance ) adipose tissue response ( basal insulin suppression lipolysis ( ED50 ) , LPL activity , cytokine release lipogenesis ) . Aim 2 : Regional fat distribution quantify anthropometrically waist hip circumference , visceral subcutaneous adipose volume muscle lipid accumulation CT-scan body composition ( total regional fat mass ) dual energy absorptiometry ( DXA ) . These outcome potentially intrigue therapeutic implication marine derive omega-3 PUFA supplementation part lifestyle program patient increase cardiometabolic risk .</detailed_description>
