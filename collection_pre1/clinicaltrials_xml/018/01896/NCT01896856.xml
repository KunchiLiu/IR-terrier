	<brief_summary>This phase I/randomized phase II study combination SGI-110 previously treat metastatic colorectal cancer patient . This study conduct two component . First , patient enrol phase I study SGI-110 combine irinotecan standard 3+3 design . After maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine , patient subsequently enrol 2:1 randomized phase II study SGI-110 irinotecan versus standard care regorafenib TAS-102 .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Participants must histologically cytologically confirm adenocarcinoma colon rectum Patients phase II cohort must amenable two research biopsy . This apply first 36 patient enrol Arm A , biopsiable disease randomize SGI110 + Irinotecan . Archival tissue must procure available Participants must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) &gt; 20 mm conventional technique &gt; 10 mm spiral CT scan . See section 10 evaluation measureable disease . Patients phase II cohort must progress receive irinotecan therapy metastatic setting . There limitation number prior therapy metastatic setting . Age minimum 18 year . Life expectancy great 12 week . ECOG performance status &lt; 1 Participants must normal organ marrow function The effect SGI110 develop human fetus unknown . For reason oncological agent know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation , 3 month completion study . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participate study within 30 day last dose , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Participants chemotherapy radiotherapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enrol study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Participants may receive study agent . Participants know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition irinotecan , decitabine SGI110 . Subjects receive prior therapy hypomethylating agent . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study SGI110 a/an hypomethylating agent potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother SGI110 , breastfeed discontinue . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . Individuals history different malignancy ineligible except follow circumstance : Individuals history malignancy diseasefree least 5 year deem investigator low risk recurrence malignancy . Individuals follow cancer eligible diagnose treat within past 5 year : cervical cancer situ , definitively treat early stage prostate cancer ( confine prostate Gleason 6 ) , definitely treat breast ductal lobular carcinoma situ , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin . HIVpositive individual combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction SGI110 . In addition , individual increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake participant receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate . Previous treatment regorafenib TAS102 ( This apply phase II . ) If patient previously receive either regorafenib OR TAS102 , must able receive alternate regimen randomize standard care arm ) . Hospitalization acute medical issue within 4 week prior screen visit would otherwise manage infusion center outpatient clinic setting ( e.g. , patient admit complete transfusion would ineligible. ) . Symptomatic bowel obstruction within 6 month prior enrollment , Patients undergo surgical correction obstruct lesion eligible within 6 month .</criteria>
