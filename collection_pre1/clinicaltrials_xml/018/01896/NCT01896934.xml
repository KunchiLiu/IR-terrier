	<brief_title>Frontal Hypoperfusion Effects Antidepressant Outcomes Late-Life Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The long-term goal line research determine late-life depression ( LLD ) , cerebrovascular dysregulation predictive antidepressant outcome . The investigator hypothesize vascular pathology result reduce cerebrovascular reactivity contributes frontocingulate hypoperfusion . Such pathology would impair neurovascular couple reduce ability vasculature improve frontocingulate perfusion antidepressant treatment . Thus decreased cerebrovascular reactivity perfusion may biomarker antidepressant nonresponse . As initial step research , current study utilize MRI arterial spin labeling ( ASL ) examine cerebrovascular reactivity deficit rest cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) deficits predict antidepressant nonremission LLD . The rationale proposal identify mechanism vascular pathology may contribute LLD . If study hypothesis correct , crucial next step support study examine antidepressant property cardiovascular drug may reverse vascular pathology improve perfusion . The investigator pursue initial goal examine ASL predictor nonremission 12-week trial sertraline . Forty LLD subject complete MRI , cognitive testing , hyperintensity assessment . ASL measure CBF obtain hypercapnia challenge rest room air . This help determine deficit cerebrovascular reactivity ( CVR ) and/or rest on-demand CBF measure predict nonremission . AIM : To test difference CVR CBF dorsal frontal cognitive control region individual remit 12-week course sertraline ( define MADRS ≤ 7 ) . Hypothesis 1 : Compared remitters , hypercapnia challenge nonremitters exhibit less CVR dlPFC dAC . Hypothesis 2 : Compared remitters , breathe room air nonremitters exhibit low rest CBF dorsal anterior cingulate ( dAC ) dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( dlPFC ) . Exploratory Aim : To examine relationship ASL measure ( CVR hypercapnia rest CBF normoxia ) performance cognitive domain implicate LLD treatment outcome . For Aim , focus function involve dlPFC dAC , specifically executive function process speed . The study enroll patient clinical referral response advertisement . In case , potential participant call study contact number . Study staff describe study , include description study entry criterion . Those continue interested scheduled evaluation . After schedule , study physician review electronic medical record assure potential subject meet entry criterion . Following policy Vanderbilt University Health System Institutional Review Board , write informed consent obtain document study 's Research Coordinator study-related procedure perform . The study coordinator review study procedure consent form potential participant . Each individual may take much time like decide wish participate . There randomization . All participant receive open-label sertraline . An initial evaluation determine eligibility , depression severity , evaluate medical psychiatric history . Participants also complete detailed battery assess cognitive function . During time also complete one-hour MRI session , include measurement cerebral perfusion vascular reactivity . They begin 12-week trial open-label sertraline , allow titration maximum dose 200mg daily . At end study participant refer ongoing clinical treatment .</detailed_description>
