	<brief_title>A Phase 3 Single Center Study Islet Transplantation Non-uremic Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>( T1D ) Type 1 diabetes afflicts nearly 2 million people United States , child young adult ( 1 ) . Untreated , fatal disease . Exogenous insulin , administer multiple injection continuous subcutaneous ( SC ) infusion wearable pump , allow long term survival develop disease , treated way good health-related quality life ( 2 ) . However , insulin therapy provide normal glycemic control , long term survivor commonly develop vascular complication diabetic retinopathy ( common cause adult blindness ) diabetic nephropathy ( common indication adult kidney transplantation ) ( 3 ) . The Diabetes Control Complications Trial ( DCCT ) establish microvascular complication diabetes prevent maintain near-normal glucose control patient T1D ( 4 ) . However , degree control always achievable despite modern insulin analogs delivery system ( 5 ) , achieve , invariably associate episode insulin-induced hypoglycemia life-threatening ( 6 ) . A small minority individual T1D develop hypoglycemia unawareness , condition life-threatening , associate severe deterioration quality life activity restriction , amenable medical therapy ( 6 , 7 ) . The hope achieve near-normal glucose control without hypoglycemia T1D provide impetus develop effective strategy β-cell replacement via pancreas isolated islet transplantation . When successful , pancreas transplantation normalize blood glucose ( BG ) diabetic recipient , associate stabilization even reversal microvascular complication ( 8 ) . However , risk procedure ( almost 10 % early failure rate due technical complication , anastomotic leak , bleeding , infection ) need lifelong immunosuppression center limit target population therapy diabetic &lt; 50 year age minimal coronary artery disease , center pancreas transplant offer concomitant kidney transplant ( 9 ) . As result , T1D patient need β-cell replacement often exclude whole pancreas transplantation . Islet transplantation , contrast , accomplish much simple procedure islet infuse portal vein ( 10 ) . While procedure without risk , procedural morbidity much less whole pancreas transplantation ( 11 ) . On hand , whereas 80 % whole pancreas transplant recipient insulin independent one year transplant , &lt; 10 % 447 islet recipient transplant 1990 1999 achieve one year insulin independence ( 12 ) . This attribute low engrafted islet mass combine high metabolic demand impose glucocorticoid use prevent rejection . In year 2000 , group Edmonton report series 7 consecutive islet transplant recipient treat islet multiple donor glucocorticoid-free immunosuppressive regimen ( 13 ) . These islet recipient insulin free follow-up range 4.5 15 month . All recipient experience severe hypoglycemic episode prior transplant , afterwards , none . The efficacy Edmonton approach confirm several center , represent major breakthrough field ( 14 ) . However , also become clear , islet recipient , loss graft function time ; Edmonton , insulin-independence rate decline 72 % one year 28 % three year ( 15 ) . A multicenter trial use Edmonton protocol confirm result initial experience raise question relate expansion procedure multiple center , toxicity immunosuppressive regimen , evaluation islet product ( 14 ) . In 2006 , NIH initiate several multi-center ( Clinical Islet Transplantation Consortium ) clinical trial islet transplantation primary goal establish islet transplantation therapeutic treatment option patient type 1 diabetes either already successful kidney transplant severe hypoglycemic event good native renal function . The clinical protocol utilized trial improve Edmonton protocol incorporates ( 1 ) T cell depletion anti-thymocyte antibody ( 16 , 17 ) ; ( 2 ) peri-transplant anti-inflammatory therapy use Tumor Necrosis Factor ( TNF ) -a blockade ( 16 ) ; ( 3 ) aggressive control glucose homeostasis transplant continue , albeit reduce , insulin therapy ( 18 ) ; ( 4 ) short-term anticoagulation therapy peri-intraportal islet infusion ( 18 , 19 ) . Northwestern one clinical center Consortium successfully transplant total eighteen patient twenty-six islet preparation use protocol past two half year . The current study protocol modifies protocol ( CIT ) Clinical Islet Transplantation consortium substitute anti-thymocyte polyclonal antibody alemtuzumab show efficacy pre-clinical model well clinical trial allogeneic islet transplantation .</detailed_description>
