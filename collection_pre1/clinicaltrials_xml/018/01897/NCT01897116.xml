At discretion Investigator , acceptable method contraception may include total abstinence case lifestyle patient ensures compliance . ( Periodic abstinence ( e.g . calendar , ovulation , sympothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception . ) Patients treat brain metastasis stable 1 month eligible ; patient must steroids 1 week prior start study treatment . Any number type prior anticancer therapy except BRAF MEK inhibitor . Patients must discontinue active immunotherapy ( IL2 , interferon , CTLA4 , etc . ) chemotherapy least 4 week prior enter study oral target therapy least 2 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent . Patients must receive investigational anticancer therapy period study four week prior entry , exception vaccine . Patients serious concurrent infection medical illness , would jeopardize ability patient receive treatment outline protocol reasonable safety . Patients pregnant breastfeeding . Patients receive concurrent therapy tumor ( i.e.chemotherapeutics investigational agent ) . Patients leptomeningeal disease . Patients concurrent prior malignancy within last 2 year , unless patient curatively treat carcinomainsitu , basal cell carcinoma squamous cell carcinoma skin . Patients treated prostate cancer breast cancer concurrent therapy indicate eligible study . Patients free disease ( prior malignancy ) ≥ five year eligible study . Due risk disease exacerbation patient porphyria eligible . Due risk disease exacerbation patient psoriasis ineligible unless disease well control care specialist disorder agree monitor patient exacerbation .
