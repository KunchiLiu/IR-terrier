	<brief_summary>Stroke common cause adult disability . Current treatment functional loss upper extremity post-stroke remain limited efficacy , particularly moderate severe impairment . Previous study demonstrate efficacy transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) motor recovery post-stroke , technique neuromodulation . Motor imagery effective enhance motor recovery , activation neural pathway similar motor execution . This treatment accessible severely impaired stroke survivor . Our previous study demonstrate feasibility efficacy motor imagery-based brain computer interface ( MI-BCI ) post-stroke motor impairment , motor imagery detect surface EEG translate execution target movement aid arm robot ( MIT-Manus ) . In study , investigate feasibility combine robot-assisted MI-BCI training , tDCS facilitate post-stroke motor recovery moderate severe impairment upper extremity function . We hypothesise tDCS-BCI sham-BCI improve motor function stroke-affected arm ; tDCS-BCI effective sham-BCI . Our secondary aim gain insight neurophysiological mechanism compare cortical excitability change follow sham-BCI vs tDCS-BCI , use transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . We conduct randomize , double-blinded study MI-BCI combine tDCS ( tDCS-BCI ) v MI-BCI combine sham-tDCS ( sham tDCS-BCI ) . Subjects undergo 10 session tDCS last 20 minute , follow 40 minute robot-assisted MI-BCI training session . Primary outcome functional ability measure upper extremity component Fugl-Meyer Assessment . Secondary outcome measure Box &amp; Block Test , Modified Ashworth Score ( measure spasticity ) , grip strength measure brain activity include transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) measure magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) measure include functional MRI diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) . This study important develop new effective treatment ( tDCS-BCI ) post-stroke motor impairment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomise control trial 32 subject sustain first ever subcortical stroke 9 month prior study enrollment , upper extremity impairment 11-45 maximum score 66 Fugl-Meyer assessment scale . Subjects randomly allocate one follow 2 group use computer-generated random sequence : 1 . 10 session 2 week MI-BCI training 20 minute tDCS precede training . 2 . 10 session 2 week MI-BCI training 20 minute sham-tDCS precede training . tDCS-BCI protocol Each 10 session tDCS-BCI sham-BCI conduct follow : tDCS perform 20 minute immediately prior session motor training . The anode place M1 motor cortex affect hemisphere cathode place unaffected M1 . After initial calibration , MI-BCI training involve MI reach task use clock game interface MIT-Manus robotic system perform multi-directional reach movement . Upon detection intention move towards target BCI , robotic arm complete reach movement towards target . Each training session last 40 minute exclude set-up time undertaken research assistant blind condition tDCS . Outcome measure Improvement motor functional ability main outcome study . Outcome measure assess follow time point : prior treatment initiation , week 2 ( immediate post-training period ) week 6 ( 4 week completion training ) . A clinician blind treatment condition ass effect intervention . Our primary outcome measure upper extremity score Fugl-Meyer Assessment ( FMA ) . This instrument measure upper extremity motor impairment include balance , coordination speed . Secondary outcome measure motor function include ( 1 ) Box Block Test : time test subject require transfer 1-inch wooden block one side box another . It measure upper extremity manual dexterity gross motor coordination . ( 2 ) Modified Ashworth Scale : 6-point measure spasticity . We assess severity spasticity shoulder , elbow , wrist finger . ( 3 ) Grip strength : measure use hand-held dynamometer.In addition , monitor adverse effect questionnaire document pain discomfort stimulation site , mood change ( use Beck Depression Inventory ) , fatigue ( use Fatigue Severity Scale ) , cognitive change ( use forward backward digit span ) .Assessment cortical excitability ? single pair pulse TMS Another aim study investigate mechanism combine treatment cortical plasticity indexed cortical excitability change - assess single paired pulse TMS . We investigate rest motor threshold , measure accord technique Rossini et al. , 1994 , treatment , accord schedule outcome measure ; paired-pulse stimulation , measure change intracortical facilitation inhibition . MRI protocol Patients scan -2 , 0 4 week investigate short-term medium-term change fMRI DTI parameter follow tDCS/BCI sham/BCI treatment . A T1-weighted high-resolution scan set axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image acquire . T1-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery image realign spatially normalized image isotropic voxel size implement Matlab.The data analysis include image registration , estimation diffusion tensor parameter include Apparent Diffusion Coefficient , Fractional Anisotropy , axial radial diffusivities tractography use Camino . Reversed phase encode EPI distortion correction , regression analysis DTI , TMS clinical finding perform use Matlab.For fMRI , image obtain rest state , active/passive hand movement imagine arm movement . For imagined arm movement , subject ask watch video screen guide performance imagine movement .</detailed_description>
