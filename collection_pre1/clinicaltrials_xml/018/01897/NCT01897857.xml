	<brief_summary>In atherosclerotic patient undergo kidney transplantation , arterial cannulation commonly perform continuous monitoring systemic blood pressure intermittent assessment arterial blood gas . The radial artery preferred artery , well-documented low complication rate easy access , , radial artery cannulation may associate complication . Atherosclerosis systemic phenomenon , structural change attributable atherosclerosis , luminal narrowing , intimal hyperplasia , reduction distensibility occur frequently throughout arterial tree . Especially patient diabetes mellitus ( DM ) , radial artery prone atherosclerosis perhaps calcification . In recent study , find radial artery flow decrease immediately cannulation , recover pre-cannulation value 5min , whereas compensatory increase blood flow ulnar artery occur immediately cannulation , persist 5 min . This study enrol patient ASA physical status 1-2 . In patient schedule elective kidney transplantation , compensatory increase blood flow ulnar artery may occur , atherosclerosis , particularly patient DM . In study , find whether appropriate compensatory increase blood flow ulnar artery radial artery cannulation two group , patient DM ( group DM ) without DM ( group nonDM ) , undergo elective kidney transplantation .</brief_summary>
