	<brief_summary>This multicenter , open-label , Phase 1/2 study conduct two part . The Phase 1 part ( closed accrual January 25 , 2016 ) comprise dose escalation expansion part establish MTD and/or recommend Phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) tazemetostat give BID ( twice daily ) orally continuous basis . Additionally , separate cohort Phase 1 , effect food bioavailability tazemetostat well drug-drug interaction ( DDI ) potential tazemetostat evaluate . The Phase 2 part initiate MTD /or RP2D establish . Phase 2 enrolls subject DLBCL ( Cohorts 1-3 6 ) FL ( Cohorts 4 5 ) determination efficacy safety tazemetostat monotherapy ( Cohorts 1-5 ) tazemetostat combination prednisolone ( Cohort 6 ) placement determine centrally confirm histology , cell origin ( COO ) , EZH2 mutation status .</brief_summary>
