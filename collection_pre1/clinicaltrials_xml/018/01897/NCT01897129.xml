	<detailed_description>Background Studies show significantly high prevalence HPV tissue miscarriage ( 60 % ) induce abortion ( 20 % ) . HPV-infection extravillous trophoblast placenta furthermore show induce cell death cause dysfunction placenta , lead adverse outcome pregnancy , e.g . preterm birth hereby related neonatal mortality morbidity . Spontaneous abortion preterm birth adverse event pregnancy , big part unknown aetilogy , area worth try elucidate mean research . Method 6 group 91 woman include : - A group early pregnant woman nuchal translucency scan around gestational week 12 similar group undergo chorion villous sample relation prenatal diagnostics fetus - A group woman spontaneous abortion gestational week 22 group preterm birth gestational week 22-32 - A group deliver spontaneously term group undergo elective cesarean term The woman examine cervical swab analyze genotyping HPV present . A vaginal swab do purpose vaginal microbiome examination later . Furthermore analysis HPV placental tissue chorion villous sample evacuation uterus miscarriage . Cervical swab placental tissue analyze mean PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ) 35 type HPV frequently find anogenital area . Blood sample collect patient analyzed HPV-antibodies .</detailed_description>
