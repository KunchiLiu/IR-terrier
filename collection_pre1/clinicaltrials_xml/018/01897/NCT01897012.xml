	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose alisertib romidepsin treat patient B-cell T-cell lymphoma return period improvement ( relapse ) respond treatment ( refractory ) . Alisertib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , romidepsin , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving alisertib romidepsin may better treatment relapsed refractory B-cell T-cell lymphoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety profile MLN8237 ( alisertib ) plus romidepsin . II . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) , reach , MLN8237 administer combination romidepsin . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate objective response rate ( ORR ) complete response ( CR ) combine regimen . II . To assess whether high level expression aurora kinase A correlate outcome . III . To determine combination result downregulation target v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog ( avian ) ( C-Myc ) C-Myc positive patient , induces mitotic catastrophe , change immune system host response , upregulates marker apoptosis . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive alisertib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-7 ( dose level 1-4 ) day 1-3 , 8-10 , 15-17 ( dose level 5-8 ) . Patients also receive romidepsin intravenously ( IV ) 4 hour day 1 8 ( dose level 1-4 ) 2 , 9 , 16 ( dose level 5-8 ) . Treatment repeat every 21 day ( dose level 1-4 ) 28 day ( dose level 5-8 ) 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
