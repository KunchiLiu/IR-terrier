	<brief_summary>This randomize pilot clinical trial study chemotherapy surgery tissue sample collection patient stage IIA-IIIC breast cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , doxorubicin hydrochloride , cyclophosphamide , paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Giving doxorubicin hydrochloride , cyclophosphamide , paclitaxel trastuzumab may kill tumor cell . Collecting store sample tissue patient breast cancer study laboratory may help doctor learn well patient respond treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy Before Surgery Tissue Sample Collection Patients With Stage IIA-IIIC Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect preoperative neoadjuvant paclitaxel doxorubicin ( doxorubicin hydrochloride ) /cyclophosphamide ( AC ) : senescence ; invasion/motility ( tumor microenvironment metastasis [ TMEM ] 67 kDa laminin receptor [ 67LR ] ) . II . To create biospecimen repository future study derive patient breast cancer receive standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy . OUTLINE : Patients human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -positive disease assign Stratum A , patient HER2-negative disease randomize Stratum B C. STRATUM A : Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour trastuzumab IV 30-90 minute weekly 12 week . Beginning 2-3 week later , patient receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 5-10 minute cyclophosphamide IV 30-60 minute every 2 week 8 week STRATUM B : Patients receive paclitaxel , doxorubicin hydrochloride , cyclophosphamide Stratum A. STRATUM C : Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV 5-10 minute cyclophosphamide IV 30-60 minute every 2 week 8 week . Patients receive paclitaxel IV 1 hour weekly 12 week . Patients undergo surgery 2-6 week last chemotherapy dose . In arm , treatment continue absence unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
