	<brief_title>Autologous Redirected RNA Meso CAR T Cells Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I study conducted establish safety feasibility intravenous ( IV ) RNA mesothelin re-directed autologous T cell administration patient chemotherapy-refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer . Subjects enrol serially . For subject safety , precede subject must complete therapy 28 day last infusion next subject treated.. Subjects treat IV administration 1 3e8/m2 RNA CAR T cell three time weekly ( M-W-F ) three week . Main eligibility criterion : Subjects metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ( PDA ) chemotherapy-refractory disease . Inclusion criterion include patient old 18 year age diagnose metastatic PDA ECOG 0-1 performance status 3 month expect survival . Exclusion criterion include pericardial effusion , active autoimmune disease require immunosuppressive therapy , active anti-coagulation therapy , know HIV HTLV I/II positivity , prior treatment murine monoclonal antibody history allergy murine protein .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma . Patients great equal 18 year age . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 . Life expectancy great 3 month . Evidence metastatic disease failure least 1 prior chemotherapy metastatic disease . Subjects must measureable disease define RECIST 1.1 criterion . Satisfactory organ bone marrow function Blood coagulation parameter : PT international normalize ratio ( INR ) less equal 1.5 ( inrange INR , usually 2 3 , subject stable dose therapeutic warfarin management venous thrombosis include pulmonary thromboembolus ) PTT le equal 1.2 time upper limit normal . Subjects must adequate venous peripheral access apheresis . Patients must also adequate venous access subsequent modify CAR T cell administration do central venous access ( e.g . port systemic chemotherapy ) Ability understand willingness provide write informed consent . Shortterm therapy acute condition specifically relate pancreatic cancer allow therapy include immune modulate agent . Male Female subject agree use approve contraceptive method ( e.g . birth control pill , barrier device , intrauterine device , abstinence ) study 3 month follow last dose study cell infusion . Subject must understand sign studyspecific inform consent . Participated trial receipt investigational study drug occur within 28 day ( 42 day nonmurine monoclonal antibody ) prior entry study . Received anticancer medication 2 week ( i.e . 14 day ) prior receive first dose study treatment concurrent chemotherapy immunotherapy ( e.g . monoclonal antibody ) Active invasive cancer pancreatic adenocarcinoma . Patients active noninvasive cancer ( nonmelanoma skin cancer , superficial cervical bladder prostate cancer PSA level le 1.0 ) exclude . Known HIV , HCV , HBV positive Active autoimmune disease ( include limit : systemic lupus erythromatosis , Sjogrens syndrome , rheumatoid arthritis , psoriasis , multiple sclerosis , inflammatory bowel disease , etc . ) require immunosuppressive therapy within past 4 week , exception thyroid replacement . Patients ongoing active infection . Planned concurrent treatment systemic high dose corticosteroid . Prior gene therapy therapy murine monoclonal antibody product murine origin . Concurrent treatment anticancer agent . History allergy murine proteins History allergy hypersensitivity study product excipients ( human serum albumin , DMSO , Dextran 40 ) Any clinically significant pericardial effusion ; CHF ( NY Heart Association Grade IIIV ) cardiovascular condition would preclude assessment mesothelin induce pericarditis . Subjects active anticoagulation therapy . Pregnant woman exclude study autologous transduce T cell may potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant , secondary treatment mother autologous transduce T cell , breastfeed discontinue mother treat . Feasibility assessment demonstrate less 20 % transfection target lymphocytes insufficient expansion modify CAR T cell complete 9 infusion .</criteria>
