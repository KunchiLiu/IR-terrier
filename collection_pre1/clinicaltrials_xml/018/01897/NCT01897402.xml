	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate production antibody new conjugate vaccine , NmVac4-A/C/Y/W-135-DT , measure vaccine effectiveness , compare production antibody similar , licensed meningococcal ( Groups A , C , Y , W-135 ) polysaccharide diphtheria toxoid ( DT ) conjugate vaccine . The investigator also evaluate safety NmVac4-A/C/Y/W-135-DT™ conjugate vaccine compare licensed vaccine . The hypothesis test vaccine comparable license active control vaccine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Meningococcal disease potentially life-threatening bacterial infection . The disease commonly express either meningococcal meningitis , inflammation membrane surround brain spinal cord , meningococcemia , presence bacteria blood . The common symptom include high fever , headache , neck stiffness , confusion , nausea , vomit , lethargy , rash . If treated disease progress rapidly lead shock death , often within hour onset symptom . The disease fatal rate 10 % . Of patient recover , 10 % permanent hearing loss serious sequela . Neisseria meningitidis capsular polysaccharide poor immunogen . However , conjugation bacterial polysaccharide immunogenic carrier protein generally result conjugate induce strong anti-polysaccharide T-helper cell dependent immune response , create longer-lasting immune response thus protection meningococcal infection . The sponsor 's small size Phase 1 clinical trial comprise 60 subject . Therefore , additional data need confirm previous data statistically power Phase 2 clinical trial . The present study aim evaluate subject response single dos , administer adult subject , determine safety immunogenicity vaccine . This study compare safety antibody production induce one intramuscular injection either NmVac4-A/C/Y/W-135-DT license meningococcal ( Groups A , C , Y , W-135 ) polysaccharide diphtheria toxoid conjugate vaccine . The primary immunogenicity endpoint seroresponse , base antibody titer ≥1:8 subject titer &lt; 1:8 baseline 4-fold rise antibody level , 4 week single injection . The number proportion subject achieve seroresponse tabulate serogroup vaccine group . A non-inferiority test use determine immune response elicit NmVac4 A/C/Y/W-135-DT™ less specified difference percent seroconversion license control vaccine . Participants attend screen visit 6 week prior vaccination ( day 0 ) , attend study visit 4 week . There study phone call day 2-3 , post-study call subject assess safety 26 week .</detailed_description>
