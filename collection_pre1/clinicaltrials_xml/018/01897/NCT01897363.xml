	<detailed_description>This study include outpatient admission clinical research center IV placement , blood draw IV , poke participant finger obtain small amount blood monitor 6 hour fast . A fast person go without food certain period time . The participant fast long 6 hour . The participant arrive outpatient clinical research center approximately 7am . A parent expect stay participant time . The participant 's finger poke blood ( require approximately one drop blood ) soon arrival make sure blood sugar already low . If participant 's blood sugar low arrival Clinical Research Center , additional blood drawn vein ( little half teaspoon ) complete rest study . If blood glucose 60 mg/dl , participant give opportunity eat prior start fast . A small tube place participant 's vein begin fast make additional blood draw easier . 1/10th teaspoon blood send cortisol test IV place . Cortisol hormone important control blood sugar . In addition , participant 's finger prick every hour blood monitor blood sugar bedside meter . Each finger prick require approximately one two drop blood . A test look fat breakdown ( ketone ) sometimes check use blood obtain prick finger check blood sugar . If blood sugar le 70 mg/dl find , blood sugar check finger prick every 30 minute instead every hour . If finger prick blood glucose le 65 mg/dl , blood collect sent clinical research center lab make sure true blood sugar read low see bedside meter ( require approximately 1/10 teaspoon blood ) . If blood sugar le 60 mg/dl find , fast end blood collect IV line ( small tube place vein ) . The participant monitor nurse fast . She check blood pressure , pulse respiratory rate periodically make sure comfortable . After final blood collection , participant allow fee normally IV remove . During entire study , expect collect least Â¾ teaspoon blood participant . No 1.2 teaspoon blood collect participant entire study . If blood sugar le 60 mg/dl find time , blood drawn vein participant 's arm study end . He allow eat . If low blood sugar unable feed way normally , sugar water/gel may give mouth sugar water may give tube place vein . If participant normally feed tube place stomach , sugar water may give tube .</detailed_description>
