	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well combination chemotherapy , gemcitabine hydrochloride , radiation therapy surgery work treat patient pancreatic cancer spread place body remove surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil , leucovorin calcium , irinotecan hydrochloride , oxaliplatin , gemcitabine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Fluorouracil , irinotecan hydrochloride , gemcitabine hydrochloride may also stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving combination chemotherapy gemcitabine hydrochloride radiation therapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess efficacy , measure proportion R0 resection , fluorouracil-leucovorin calcium-irinotecan hydrochloride-oxaliplatin ( FOLFIRINOX ) chemotherapy regimen follow gemcitabine base chemoradiotherapy use preoperative therapy patient borderline resectable adenocarcinoma pancreas . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To measure overall response rate ( ORR ) . II . To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) . III . To evaluate progression free survival ( PFS ) . IV . To evaluate safety toxicity associate chemotherapy radiotherapy . V. To assess adverse event relate surgery . VI . To assess proportion patient able undergo resection . VII . To assess proportion patient require vascular reconstruction . OUTLINE : CHEMOTHERAPY REGIMEN : Patients receive oxaliplatin intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , irinotecan hydrochloride IV 90 minute day 1 , fluorouracil IV 46 hour day 1-3 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve disease progression proceed chemoradiotherapy . CHEMORADIOTHERAPY REGIMEN : Beginning 4-6 week completion chemotherapy , patient undergo intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) 5 consecutive day per week total 28 fraction receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 30 month .</detailed_description>
