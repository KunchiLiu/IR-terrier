One novel technique , `` loop drainage '' , report case reports/case series management variety type abscesses surgical subspecialty literature . We propose conduct randomize prospective study compare efficacy loop drainage technique traditional incision drainage technique abscess management . Patients present main urgent care area Emergency Department Boston Medical Center treatment abscess consider enrollment potential subject . After treat clinician identifies patient appropriate subject , Research Associate ( RA ) approach patient obtain write informed consent enroll study . The subject randomize management arm either loop drainage traditional I &amp; D . The clinician fill data sheet describe abscess characteristic , perform either loop drainage incision drainage , depend randomization subject fill satisfaction survey . Fourteen day initial visit , subject return follow-up . The subject fill satisfaction survey , study investigator blind treatment group ass subject abscess resolution , cosmetic outcome , number follow-up visit , complication .
