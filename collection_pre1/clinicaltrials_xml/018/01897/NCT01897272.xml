	<detailed_description>Your participation study last five office visit approximately 30 minute . If decide participate study , would first come clinic would undergo standard measurement . This include measure grip key pinch strength complete patient questionnaire . During visit scan cross-sectional area median nerve pisiform bone level determine level CTS Ultrasound Biomiscroscopy machine ( Vevo 2100 ) . This new technique machine similar regular ultrasound machine . The primary difference frequency soundwaves high standard ultrasound machine . There know significant risk associate use machine . At time machine experimental , currently approve FDA clinical use . However , device consider pose significant risk . Candidates study must diagnose single carpal tunnel syndrome go receive nerve decompression short incision , age 18 , able give inform consent participate research study .</detailed_description>
