	<detailed_description>Since early 1960 cognitive test perform conjunction BLSA visit . Prior mid-1980 , primary focus investigation natural history age associate change memory cognitive function . While portion work Cognition Section still involve descriptive study cross-sectional longitudinal effect age specific cognitive ability , cognitive test program refocus mid-1980 investigate early predictor cognitive change , include risk protective factor cognitive impairment Alzheimer disease . In collaboration Dr. Claudia Kawas , recently Dr. Richard O Brien Johns Hopkins Department Neurology , research program Cognition Section expand ascertain incident case cognitive impairment dementia , include home visit assessment inactive participant . In addition , autopsy program collaboration Alzheimer Disease Research Center ( ADRC ) Johns Hopkins University initiate . This collaboration yield number important finding include information incidence Alzheimer disease , demonstration use hormone replacement therapy postmenopausal woman non-steroidal antiinflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) old adults6 associate reduction risk Alzheimer disease community-dwelling BLSA participant sample .</detailed_description>
