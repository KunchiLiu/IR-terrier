	<brief_summary>Small bowel obstruction common reason surgical admission . Most common reason small bowel obstruction adhesion , account 70-80 % small bowel obstruction . Large proportion adhesive small bowel obstruction may treat nonoperatively , 50-60 % may need surgical intervention . Current golden standard surgical intervention open adhesiolysis . Recently , retrospective study provide encouraging result laparoscopic adhesiolysis small bowel obstruction . However , prospective randomize trial carry retrospective series carry high risk patient selection bias . Although general laparoscopy associate shorten hospital stay , less pain reduced mortality , laparoscopic adhesiolysis small bowel obstruction report cause iatrogenic small bowel lesion 7 % patient . Aim study compare open adhesiolysis laparoscopic adhesiolysis . The investigator hypothesis laparoscopic adhesiolysis safe , shorten hospital stay , reduce mortality compare open approach .</brief_summary>
