	<brief_summary>Background : - Participants Baltimore Longitudinal Study Aging study examine change brain structure function time , determine change predict likelihood individual develop think memory impairment Alzheimer disease later life . Imaging study neuropsychological test conduct current participant , new participant recruit study . To develop good treatment therapy aging-related memory loss disorder , researcher interest determine whether early prediction think memory impairment accurate evaluate factor affect prediction . Objectives : - To use imaging study test think memory determine early marker Alzheimer disease cognitive impairment . Eligibility : - Current participant new recruit Baltimore Longitudinal Study Aging . Design : - Participants screen full medical history physical examination , well blood urine test . - Participants test visit direct study researcher . All participant test part initial enrollment study , may ask return yearly , 2 year later , 4 year later repeat test . - At visit , participant brain imaging scan ( include magnetic resonance image and/or magnetic resonance spectroscopy measure brain structure function , positron emission tomography study blood flow brain ) evaluate brain structure function . Participants also take test memory problem-solving skill . - Treatment provide part protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We examine change brain structure function predictor cognitive decline impairment longitudinal neuroimaging assessment select Baltimore Longitudinal Study Aging ( BLSA ) participant . The hypothesis driving study accelerate preclinical change brain structure function specific region , include mesial temporal cortex , cingulate cortex , inferior parietal cortex , predict individual subsequently develop cognitive impairment Alzheimer disease . Since 1994 , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , positron emission tomography ( PET ) , neuropsychological testing perform neuroimaging participant , age 55 older . In next phase study , continue longitudinal test old participant continue enrol additional participant . We continue MRI study brain structure , enhance measure vascular change , perform PET study cerebral blood flow , amyloid distribution brain , , subset participant , cerebral glucose metabolism . We also extend MRI neuropsychological evaluation additional 60 BLSA participant age 20 54 . Our initial data indicate substantial change brain volume tissue composition 5th evaluation , despite minimal cognitive change generally healthy sample . We continue follow individual examine modifier structural functional brain change association cognitive decline . Potential modulators include genetic factor , hormonal status therapy , medication , dietary supplement , health-related factor . We already observe acceleration hippocampal volume loss individual increase genetic risk Alzheimer disease , carrier apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele , modulation memory regional cerebral blood flow activation pattern function postmenopausal hormone therapy woman endogenous testosterone concentration men . We continue examine modifier brain-behavior association . Early prediction cognitive impairment factor alter incidence progression disease essential new therapy horizon .</detailed_description>
