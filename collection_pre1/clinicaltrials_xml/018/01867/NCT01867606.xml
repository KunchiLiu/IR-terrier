	<brief_summary>This randomize pilot phase II trial study well serum bovine immunoglobulin protein isolate work improve quality life post-operative recovery patient cancer female reproductive tract undergo surgery . Serum bovine immunoglobulin may help provide nutrition patient able eat digest ordinary food . This may improve quality life patient gynecological cancer help recover quickly surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Serum Bovine Immunoglobulin Protein Isolate Improving Quality Life Post-Operative Recovery Patients With Gynecological Cancer After Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare time-to-quality life ( QOL ) improvement baseline postoperative gynecological cancer patient receive oral serum bovine immunoglobulin ( SBI ) vs. placebo . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare surgical complication rate oral SBI vs. placebo 1 month post-surgery ( safety endpoint ) . II . To compare QOL , derive previously-validated Symptom Distress Scale , Postoperative Quality Life questionnaire ( PQL ) , uniscale ( overall QOL item ) patient receive oral SBI vs. placebo . III . To compare grade 2 bad adverse event rate patient receive oral SBI vs. placebo . IV . To characterize adverse event profile oral SBI postoperative gynecological cancer patient ( safety endpoint ) . V. To compare supplement adherence patient receive oral SBI vs. placebo . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore whether candidate biomarkers modify SBI versus placebo . II . As part ongoing research , bank leftover blood sample future study . III . To explore quality life postoperative recovery gynecologic surgery , regardless whether patient take study intervention/placebo discontinue intervention/placebo early . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive SBI orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO BID day 1-28 . In arm , treatment repeat every 28 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
