	<brief_summary>Sepsis significant cause health care expenditure carry extremely high rate morbidity mortality treat appropriately . From 1979 2000 , sepsis result 10 million admission hospital United States mortality rate 17.9 27.8 percent . In Canada , estimate incidence sepsis 2008-2009 103.3 per 100,000 per year . Advances multifaceted management sepsis recent year result improved clinical outcome . However , cornerstone sepsis management relies prompt administration appropriate antibiotic . Current clinical practice suggest antibiotic administration delay 45 minute order obtain blood culture , whose result profound impact type duration antimicrobial therapy . Unfortunately , recommendation base little evidence investigator find potential life-saving treatment often delay order abide . Furthermore , recent data suggest mortality could increase approximately 5 % delay antibiotic administration time period . The investigator therefore wish organize prospective , multi-centre trial order identify effect antibiotic administration blood culture positivity patient present severe sepsis septic shock . Other objective elucidate patient factor , include age , co-morbid condition clinical presentation , well antibiotic choice affect blood culture result . This study conduct emergency department St. Paul 's Hospital ( SPH ) , Vancouver General Hospital ( VGH ) , Lion 's Gate Hospital ( LGH ) . Patients identify aforementioned condition treat per routine hospital protocol . If patient deem eligible study , second set blood blood culture subsequently draw ideally 30 60 minute administration antibiotic therapy . Subject demographic data collect pertaining age , comorbid immunocompromised condition , vital sign , laboratory test pertain end organ dysfunction , suspect source sepsis , type antibiotic administer time antimicrobial administration respect second set blood culture take . Our hypothesis blood culture positivity patient present severe sepsis septic shock alter significantly antibiotic therapy . If , study would strongly argue delay life-saving therapy would thus greatly improve patient care local emergency room . If incorrect , study would first demonstrate benefit obtain blood culture antibiotic therapy would strengthen current recommendation .</brief_summary>
