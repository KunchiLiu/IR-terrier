	<brief_summary>It hypothesize patient low pre-PCI serum level sRAGE receive DES implantation and/ procedure take increase serum level sRAGE and/ decrease serum level AGE . The purpose pilot study afford invasive cardiologist additional evidence base information guide decision patient receive BMS DES coronary implantation . The objective study determine whether : 1 . Patients low pre-PCI serum level sRAGE receive bare metal stent develop restenosis 2 . Patients high pre-PCI serum level sRAGE receive bare metal stent reduce risk development restenosis 3 . Patients low pre-PCI serum level sRAGE receive drug elute stent increase risk development restenosis</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Advanced glycation end product ( AGE ) irreversible adduct form non-enzymatic glycation oxidation protein , lipid nucleic acid . 1-4 AGE interacts three type cell receptor advance glycation end product ( RAGE ) namely full-length RAGE , N-truncated C-truncated soluble receptor AGE ( sRAGE ) . The interaction full-length RAGE AGE increase expression adhesion molecule , include soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( sVCAM-1 ) cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α ( TNF- α ) activation nuclear factor kappa B ( NFκB ) turn increase expression proinflammatory gene adhesion molecule cytokine , generation reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) . The function N-truncated RAGE poorly understood . sRAGE membrane bound circulate plasma . Acting decoy RAGE ligand ( AGE ) , sRAGE compete full-length RAGE ligand binding . Consequently , sRAGE play protective role prevent activation full-length RAGE . Adhesion molecule , cytokine , ROS involve development progression atherosclerosis lesion instability . The AGE RAGE axis involve development atherosclerosis diabetes . Balloon injury carotid artery endothelial denudation animal model increase level RAGE AGE arterial wall produce neointimal hyperplasia . Treatment sRAGE animal model reduce neointimal growth , decrease smooth muscle cell proliferation migration , expression extracellular matrix . sRAGE reduce atherosclerotic lesion Apo-E -/- mouse effect associate decrease aortic VCAM-1 tissue factor . Recently , demonstrate level serum sRAGE lower serum level AGE , sVCAM-1 TNF-α high subject NSTEMI compare healthy control 31 . Furthermore , show NSTEMI patient , underwent PCI BMS implantation develop post-PCI restenosis six-months , low serum level sRAGE compare 30 . In propose study expect find patient low level serum sRAGE receive either BMS develop post-PCI restenosis patient low serum level sRAGE receive DES increased rate post-PCI restenosis . In addition , patient high level sRAGE receive either BMS DES reduce rate restenosis . This study clinical significance previous study ( McNair et al , 2010 ) , demonstrate low serum level sRAGE associate 100 % restenosis follow BMS implantation . In situation DES implantation highly beneficial .</detailed_description>
