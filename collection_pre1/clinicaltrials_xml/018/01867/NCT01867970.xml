	<brief_summary>Rationale : Physical activity important factor healthy lifestyle . Although physical activity delay complication decrease burden disease chronically ill person , level activity often far optimal . Many intervention develop stimulate physical activity , disappointing result . New field use technology . Human persuasion ( example guidance practice nurse ) enhance technological persuasion . Therefore monitor feedback tool , consist accelerometer link smart phone webserver , develop test . Objective : The main objective study measure effect monitor feedback tool embed Self-management Support Program physical activity . The secondary objective measure effect self-efficacy , quality life health status . In addition process evaluation conduct . Study design : A three-armed cluster randomise control trial conduct 240 patient 24 general practice . Randomisation level practice . The following condition compare : 1 ) Tool Self-management Support Program ; 2 ) Self-management Support Program ; 3 ) Care usual . Outcome measure measure t0 ( start intervention ) , t1 ( 6 month , end intervention ) t2 ( 9 month ) . Study population : 120 People COPD 120 people Diabetes type 2 ( age 40-70 ) treat primary care include 24 GP practice . Intervention : Spread period six month patient condition 1 2 visit practice nurse 3-4 time physical activity counselling . Specific activity goal set tailor individual patient 's preference need . On top , patient condition 1 instruct use monitor feedback tool daily life . Patients condition 3 expose intervention . Main study parameters/endpoints : Primary outcome : physical activity measure physical activity monitor ( PAM ) . Secondary outcome : quality life , general self-efficacy , exercise self-efficacy health status .</brief_summary>
