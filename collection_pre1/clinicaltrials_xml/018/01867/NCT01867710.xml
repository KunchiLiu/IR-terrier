	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine safety clinical benefit combination abiraterone acetate prednisone abiraterone dexamethasone prostate cancer patient . Prednisone give one three different dose schedule . Dexamethasone give one dose schedule . This include look side effect occur often occur . In addition impact study drug quality life pain evaluate . The study also collect data subsequent treatment patient come study drug ( maximum 5 year study start ) . By analyze blood sample , study aim identify marker could help understand treatment abiraterone effective also help understand patient become resistant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize ( study drug assign chance ) , open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , parallel-arm , multicenter , phase 2 study treatment abiraterone acetate ( AA ) 4 alternative steroid treatment strategy asymptomatic , chemotherapy-naïve , mCRPC patient . A target 144 patient enrol study 36 patient plan per treatment arm . All patient participate study receive abiraterone acetate . All patient also take either prednisone dexamethasone . Patients receive abiraterone acetate along either prednisone one three different dose schedule dexamethasone one dose schedule . Patients may also ask take medication protect osteoporosis increase long term use corticosteroid . There 4 treatment group study : ( ) Four 250mg tablet abiraterone acetate take together daily one 2.5 mg tablet prednisone take twice daily ; ( b ) Four 250mg tablet abiraterone acetate take together daily one 5 mg tablet prednisone take daily ; ( c ) Four 250mg tablet abiraterone acetate take together daily one 5 mg tablet prednisone take twice daily ; ( ) Four 250mg tablet abiraterone acetate take together daily one 0.5 mg tablet dexamethasone take daily . The chance patient get prednisone 3 4 patient . The chance get dexamethasone 1 4 patient . Abiraterone acetate , prednisone dexamethasone consider study drug . The main study consist screen phase 4 week follow open-label treatment period maximum 39 treatment cycle ( 156 week approximately 3 year ) . The main study treatment period cut-off date 156 week start study treatment first patient participate study . Patients participate main study treatment period cut-off date , receive study treatment radiographic disease progression and/or unequivocal clinical progression and/or specific reason discontinuation treatment . Patients ask would willing participate follow-up extension phase study maximum 5 year study start . The amount time patient study vary depend join study time remain study end date response treatment . Patients may come study drug cancer worsens , unable tolerate study treatment , doctor determines begin another cancer treatment , decide withdraw consent . A treatment `` cycle '' study amount time patient ask take study medication , regularly pre-scheduled checkup laboratory assessment . Each treatment-cycle last 28 day . There maximum 39 treatment cycle study ( period 156 week ) . If patient enter extension phase , ask attend hospital every 12 week remain time stay study . Other anticancer therapy immunotherapy must end participate clinical study abiraterone acetate . Also medication allow study . For example , patient receive steroid prednisone , necessary switch prednisone dexamethasone , depend treatment group patient assign , duration study . If need , study doctor may slowly decrease stop current medicine study treatment start . This call washout . Do stop take current medicine unless study doctor tell patient . At screen study doctor first check patient qualify . Screening procedure conduct within 4 week randomization . During main study treatment phase patient come study clinic Study Visits 21 time total ( include screen ) stay treatment 39 cycle . During Cycle 1 study , patient ask come clinic three time assessment : Day 1 also usually first day treatment , Day 15 two week later . After patient need return clinic every four week first 6 month . After , visit every 3 month assessment . In addition , patient need visit either clinic Outpatients every 2 week first 3 month every 4 week end treatment provide small quantity blood testing . If patient either continue study treatment 39 cycle , patient discontinue study 39 treatment cycle , last visit drug dispense call End-of-main-study-treatment ( EOMT ) visit . EOMT assessment perform patient start study treatment , either cut-off date discontinue cut-off date . Additionally , patient discontinue study treatment cut-off date , end-of-main-study ( EOMS ) visit perform 4 week study medication stop . Patients also require return study site 4 week last treatment `` End Main Study '' visit . This visit routine study assessment . During extension phase , patient provide study drug outside main study maximum 5 year study start . During phase , patient receive study drug 12 weekly visit doctor check health status time . Patients require provide blood urine sample phase . Patients likely eligible join extension phase patient respond well study drug discontinue main study . Also even discontinue main study , disease progression doctor may advise eligible join phase . Their last visit call End Extension visit . For visit , patient require return study site 4 week last treatment final assessment . Follow-Up : Following discontinuation study treatment time study , reason withdrawal consent , survival subsequent prostate cancer therapy monitor 5 year start study treatment first patient participate study . This information obtain 6-monthly telephone contact and/or chart review , source data verification visit schedule death patient end study . Their doctor may phone family ask health status 5 year period he/she feel chart record may need update . A Scientific Advisory Committee commission ensure scientific validity study , identify scientifically relevant trend , provide recommendation sponsor .</detailed_description>
