	<brief_summary>Background : - RM-493 drug stimulates part brain control eat metabolism . It help reduce body weight improve insulin sensitivity lab test . However , fully know whether RM-493 cause weight loss decrease appetite increase metabolism . Researchers want see RM-493 affect metabolism hormone affect metabolic rate . They also want see RM-493 affect appetite assessing feeling hunger fullness . They study drug people obese otherwise good health . Objectives : - To see RM-493 affect metabolic rate appetite obese otherwise healthy individual . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 50 year old obese ( body mass index 30 40 kg/m2 ) otherwise healthy . Design : - The study consist three phase . The first phase screen visit . The second phase 8-day inpatient stay . The final phase follow-up phone call one week end second phase . - Participants divide two group . One group receive study drug first , follow placebo . The group receive placebo follow study drug . The study drug placebo give skin 3 day small device ( OmniPod ) normally use give insulin people diabetes . - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . They also meet dietitian . The OmniPod device demonstrate use . - Participants follow procedure 8-day inpatient stay : - Daily exercise routine ( walk treadmill ) set comfortable pace ( mile per hour ) exercise test - Wear physical activity monitor - Body composition study measure amount fat muscle - Calorie control study diet - Study drug/placebo dose OmniPod ( Days 2 4 5 7 ) - Metabolic rate study use cart metabolic chamber - Daily blood sample - Urine collection 24 hour - Questions weight history appetite - About week inpatient stay , participant followup phone call ask side effect study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity chronic relapse health problem strong risk factor type 2 diabetes , hypertension , heart disease stroke . Life expectancy short obese individual often suffer costly relate co-morbidities certain cancer , liver disease , osteoarthritis , sleep apnea depression . Weight loss improve co-morbidities . Diet exercise effective short term , rarely effective span year . New therapy need especially patient obesity . The melanocortin system , specifically , melanocortin 4 receptor ( MC4R ) involve regulation energy homeostasis body weight . This role validate human genetic mutation , animal model obesity , stimulation MC4R reduce food intake increase metabolic rate , cause reduction body weight . RM-493 potent , selective peptide agonist MC4R suppress food intake reduce body weight preclinical study . RM-493 study single dose multiple ascend dose clinical study obese volunteer . This study randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multiple-dose , 2-period , crossover study assess effect RM-493 rest energy expenditure measure room calorimeter . Twelve obese otherwise healthy adult subject age 18 50 inclusive , enrol randomize one 2 treatment sequence ( RM-493 placebo ; placebo RM-493 ) 8-day study interval . Components 24-hour energy expenditure , exercise induce energy expenditure , spontaneous physical activity , respiratory quotient , safety pharmacokinetic data collect .</detailed_description>
