	<brief_summary>Background : - Diesel fuel commonly use fuel power car truck worldwide . However , diesel exhaust fume harmful effect body . Researchers interested study diesel exhaust exposure affect lung health . To study effect , researcher look employee diesel truck engine test facility China . Some worker facility expose high level diesel exhaust . This study compare test monitor information group highly expose worker similar group unexposed comparable control . Objectives : - To study effect diesel exhaust lung health . Eligibility : - Participants draw diesel truck engine test facility workplace China . - Individuals least 18 year age work workshop diesel fuel . - Individuals least 18 year age work workshop use diesel fuel . Design : - Depending type factory study subject work , participant wear personal air pump small badge clothe one day . This equipment measure particles , chemical , compound air . This information plus information collect study include workplace practice use estimate exposure diesel exhaust among study subject . - Participants provide number study sample . These sample include blood , urine , sputum . To collect sample , participant also mouth rinse , cheek cell scrape , nasal cell scrape . They also physical exam . - Treatment provide part study . Participants receive financial compensation participation study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Occupational Environmental Epidemiology Branch long history conduct research carcinogenicity diesel exhaust exposure . Most recently , 20 year effort collaboration NIOSH result seminal publication show dose-response relationship air level elemental carbon , surrogate diesel exhaust , risk lung cancer underground miner ( Silverman et al . 2012 ) . This study make critically important contribution recent IARC decision categorize diesel exhaust Group I carcinogen . Despite year experimental study , small limit workplace biomarker study , still major uncertainty mechanism diesel exhaust cause lung cancer human . To address gap knowledge , identify diesel truck engine test facility China , worker expose high level diesel exhaust , provide believe best opportunity conduct study provide new insight diesel exhaust carcinogenesis . We propose carry cross-sectional molecular epidemiology study 50 highly exposed worker facility 50 unexposed comparable control study potential mechanism action diesel exhaust exposure . These include upper-airway nitro-PAH-DNA adduct ; inflammatory effect determine alteration cytokine related marker link prospectively risk lung cancer ; alteration gene expression wide range potentially relevant pathway .</detailed_description>
