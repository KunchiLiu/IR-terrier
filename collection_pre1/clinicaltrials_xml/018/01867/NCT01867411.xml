	<brief_summary>Background : - Smoking difficult habit quit , people find difficult quit others . Nicotine substance cigarette make smoke addictive . Nicotine change pattern brain activity , smoker difference brain activity compare non-smokers . Some gene make likely person become addicted smoking . Researchers want study nicotine interacts gene brain activity . This may help develop good treatment help people quit smoke . Objectives : - To develop test nicotine dependence , use brain activity genetic analysis , may useful predict success smoke cessation development new smoke cessation treatment target . Eligibility : - Main group : Current smoker 18 55 year age seek treatment quit . - Comparison group : Current smoker 18 55 year age seek quit . - Comparison group : Healthy former smoker 18 55 year age . - Comparison group : Healthy nonsmoking volunteer 18 55 year age . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood sample collect . - The three comparison group one magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan session . They test think , concentration , memory inside scanner , sit front computer . - Current smoker try quit must willing undergo course nicotine treatment include weekly counseling ( 12 week ) e-cigarettes . Participants attempt smoke abstinence total 6 MRI scanning session . They think , concentration , memory task inside outside scanner . - For smoker , first scan session take place attempt quit . This baseline scan . The second scanning session take place 48 hour last real cigarette . After scan , use electronic cigarette help quit habit . - After use e-cigarettes two week , smoker third scan session.. They gradually taper use electronic cigarette course three week , point nicotine abstinent . - After 5 week abstinence , fourth scan . The fifth scan approximately 6 month start study , final scan take place 1 year study start . - Smokers continue receive support quit smoke study end 1 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To develop neuroimaging/genetic/epigenetic biomarker nicotine dependence severity may useful predict success smoke cessation development new smoke cessation treatment target . Study population : Four group study : target group treatment seek smoker ; nontreatment seek current smoker ; never smoker former smoker . We estimate need n=50/group completers sufficient power develop brain/genetics biomarkers . Design : This study consist 4 group between/within subject design . The experimental group proceed 4 phase : Baseline ( scan 1 ) , peak withdrawal ( scan 2 ) , stable e-cigarettes ( scan 3 ) , complete abstinence ( scans 4-6 ) . Counseling start first scan session generally continue weekly scan 4 ( 12 week ) . After scan 4 , therapeutic support provide least monthly via phone completion protocol . The non-treatment seek smoker comparison group scan twice ; baseline ( scan 1 ) peak withdrawal ( scan 2 ) . Each non-smoking comparison group ( non- Ex-smokers ) scan baseline ( scan 1 ) . Genetic epigenetic marker obtain group . Outcome measure : Network multivariate pattern analysis , behavior decision make task task base rest state blood oxygen level-dependent ( BOLD ) activation neural circuit relevant nicotine addiction fMRI scan . Secondary outcome include BOLD response comparison e-cigarettes smoke genetic marker nicotine addiction relapse susceptibility .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : All participant must : 1 . Be ages 1860 . Be righthanded . 2 . Be good health . 3 . Be free active DSMIV abuse/dependence , dependence partial remission , alcohol drug except nicotine . Past active dependence acceptable provide least five year past . Those past dependence substance alcohol marijuana may current use ( past 6 month ) substance dependent . Individuals past dependence either alcohol marijuana report current use previously dependent substance may include , provide currently meet criterion dependence , exception tolerance . 4 . Be able abstain alcohol 24hrs imaging session able abstain caffeine 24hrs session . 5 . For treatment nontreatment seek smoker group , must urine cotinine level great equal 4 smoke consistently least one year . For light smoker ( less 10 cpd ) , define smoke current level least past year ( exclude quit attempt last year ) . For heavy smoker ( 10 cpd ) , must smoke least average 10 cpd least past year ( exclude quit attempt ) . Based correlation selfreported cpd/FTND urine cotinine level [ 85a , 85b ] , single inclusion criterion easy manage provide adequate characterization dependent smoker . Urine cotinine level provide biomarker rely selfreport/memory . Quit attempt assess via clinical interview judgment . 6 . For treatment seek group , actively seek treatment smoke cessation willing engage 12weeks treatment involve nicotine substitution ( ecigarettes ) weekly counsel session , well followup image behavioral assessment follow treatment onset . 7 . For treatment seek group , follow discontinuaiton regular cigarette smoking , willing attempt use ecigarette approximately 5 week prior abstinence nicotine product . 8 . For nonsmoking control group , less 20 cigarette lifetime , none past year history daily smoking . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1. suitable undergo fMRI experiment due certain implanted device ( cardiac pacemaker neurostimulator , artificial joint , metal pin , surgical clip implant metal part ) , body morphology , claustrophobia . 2. coagulopathies , history , current superficial , deep vein thrombosis , musculoskeletal abnormality restrict individual ability lie flat extend period time . 3. HIV Syphilis . 4. regularly use prescription ( e.g. , antidepressant , benzodiazepine , antipsychotic , anticonvulsant , barbiturate ) , overthecounter ( e.g. , cold medicine ) herbal medication ( e.g. , Kava , Gingko biloba , St. John wort ) may alter CNS function , cardiovascular function , neuronalvascular coupling . 5. current neurological illness include , limited , seizure disorder , frequent migraine prophylaxis , multiple sclerosis , movement disorder , history significant head trauma , CNS tumor . 6. current major psychiatric disorder include , limited , mood , anxiety , psychotic disorder , substanceinduced psychiatric disorder , current suicidal ideation currently antidepressant antipsychotic medication treatment . The MAI reserve right exclude basis psychiatric history explicitly describe criterion . 7 . Are cognitively impair learn disable . 8. significant cardiovascular cerebrovascular condition . 9. major medical condition view investigator would compromise safety individual participation . The following lab value result exclusion study : Hemoglobin le 10 g/dl White Blood Cell Count less 2400/microl Liver Function Tests great 3X normal Serum glucose great 200 mg/dl Urine protein great 2 plus Serum creatinine great 2 mg/dl Estimated creatinine clearance less 60ml/min 10. pregnant , plan become pregnant , breastfeed . Females instruct consent use effective form birth control study period .</criteria>
