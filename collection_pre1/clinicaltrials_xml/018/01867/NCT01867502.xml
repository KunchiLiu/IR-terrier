	<brief_summary>Exercise consider way benefit health unhealthy healthy individual . This confirm different scientific research , people participate improve health . The present study conduct test hypothesis vildagliptin associate metformin may impact improve glucose variability sub-maximal exercise test , compare glibenclamide . Our general aim evaluate glucose variability submaximal exercise test treatment vildagliptin glibenclamide . The specific aim study evaluate oxidative stress , endothelial function , metabolic cardiovascular response exercise treatment vildagliptin glibenclamide . All response important patient Diabetes Mellitus type II . Allied patient 's routine treatment ( metformin ) , receive orally second drug , take 12 week . The patient raffle take one two drug act glycemia , call vildagliptin ( 50 mg drug twice day ) glibenclamide ( 5 mg day first week later increase 5 mg twice day ) . The metformin drug continue use . Patients meet eligible criterion study first make test maximum effort , determination peak oxygen consumption ( VO2peak ) ventilatory threshold . Forty eight hour test , patient allow pre-drugs protocol give three consecutive day explain . - Day 1 : Begin 24-hour urinary collection , perform vascular doppler ultrasound evaluate endothelial function glucose sensor insert subcutaneously ( begin continuous glucose monitoring system - CGMS evaluation ) ; - Day 2 : End 24-hour urinary collection , submit submaximal test ( blood collection baseline , 15 30 min session , 60 min recovery ) . On day , patient begin 24h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring ( 24h-ABPM ) . - Day 3 : Removal glucose sensor ; end 24h ABPM , randomization . This protocol , except randomization repeat end 12 week treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Vildagliptin Versus Glibenclamide Glycemia After Exercise Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main procedure occur three consecutive day , randomization 3 day 12 week . In first day , patient begin 24hour urinary collection ; ultrasonography make fast state place sensor ( CGMS MAPA ) . In second day , blood sample collect patient undergo sub-maximal exercise test ; third day sensor remove . The sub-maximal exercise test occur day 2 standard breakfast ( 500 kcal ; 60 % carbohydrate , 30 % fat 10 % protein ) 8 hour overnight fast . After three day first assessment , select patient divide two group , group 1 receive vildagliptin group 2 receive glibenclamide 12 week . There follow visit week 4 8 . The variable response exercise ( sub-maximal test ) compare group 12 week . The sample estimate 20 patient ( 10 % drop include ) DM2 , outpatient clinic Serviço de Endocrinologia Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre ( HCPA ) public health . Patients randomize metformin plus vildagliptin ( MET + vilda ) , receive additional vidagliptin dose 50 mg twice day metformin plus glibenclamide group ( MET + gliben ) receive additional glibenclamide dose 5 - 20 mg day . Based Marfella et al ( 13 ) study evaluation efficacy treatment Vildagliptin Sitagliptin blood glucose patient DM2 inadequately control Metformin , sample size 90 % power one alpha ( α ) 0 , 01 calculate . Vidagliptin serious effect ( 51 % reduction MAGE ) , since average difference 25mg/dl 16 7mg/dl SD . After 20 subject analyze , calculated sample redone confirm sample efficacy evidence expect effect evidence . Adverse event , include serious adverse event pregnancy collect report medical report study ( Annex IV ) . The report contain serious adverse event pregnancy forward respective manufacturer laboratory within 24 hr knowledge , health authority accord local law .</detailed_description>
