	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers interested learn dementia cause . They want look genetic basis dementia . Identifying genetic aspect dementia may help provide good test treatment . It may also show rare gene variant cause alter person 's risk develop dementia . This study look people dementia , family member , healthy volunteer . Objectives : - To study genetic influence dementia . Eligibility : - Individuals diagnose dementia . - Family member individual diagnose dementia . - Healthy volunteer least 18 year age . Design : - Participants interview answer question medical history . They also provide general information relative ' medical history . - Participants provide blood sample genetic testing . - Participants remain study 10 year . They regular visit monitor brain health function . - Treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dementia condition decline mental ability , especially memory . Dementia occur age become frequent age , prevalence 5 % -10 % people 65 20 % people 80 . Dementia affect rate information processing , short term memory affect long term memory . It difficult diagnose even three common type : Alzheimers disease , Lewy Body disease multi infarct dementia . Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) genetically complex heterogeneous disorder . It common form dementia , account 50-70 % typical , late onset case dementia . To date , mutation three gene ( APP , PSEN1 , PSEN2 ) describe cause familial early-onset AD . In addition , common polymorphism gene encode apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) associate common late-onset form disease . Genetic variability APOE locus major determinant late onset Alzheimer disease . Recent estimate suggest four establish gene account less 30 % genetic variance age onset AD predict numerous AD gene may exist . Lewy Body Disease include range disorder : Parkinson Disease , Dementia Lewy body , Parkinson dementia , among others . Dementia Lewy body ( DLB ) account 20 % case dementia old age . Clinically DLB characterize cognitive impairment , visual hallucination , parkinsonism . Lewy body neuronal inclusion comprise abnormally truncate phosphorylated neurofilament protein , alpha-synuclein , ubiquitin associate enzyme . Mutations alpha synuclein gene first discover 1996 family autosomal dominant Lewy body parkinsonism . However , lewy body parkinsonism due variant alpha-synuclein gene . The importance alpha-synuclein attribute finding antibody alpha -synuclein stain Lewy body brain Lewy body disease case . The ability identify underlying genetic influence result different synuclein pathology key understand disorder . The first aim protocol collect family history dementia attempt clone causative gene defect ( ) via linkage positional cloning . Our experience clone Amyloid Precursor Protein mutation Alzheimer disease show approach lead well understand biochemical physiological process underlie disease . It clear numerous form dementia disease appear inherit Mendelian manner . Whilst may cause environmental effect also reasonable hypothesize disease may cause complex genetic interaction . Furthermore , susceptibility environmental influence may affect genetic predisposition . As second aim protocol , investigate association genetic polymorphism dementia . This performed candidate gene approach , assess contribution gene already associate familial form disease , likely candidate ( example involve cholinergic system , cell survival Beta Amyloid processing ) gene within genetic region previously link disease . Although significant association imply causal relationship presence variant disease , pathophysiologic significance study . The inevitable problem false positive within type analysis real one , may address independent replication tightly control experiment . Undeniably analytical effort need differentiate positive false positive considerable , readily see Alzheimer disease , literature scatter positive association subsequent refutation . However , important research group continue identify replicate study .</detailed_description>
