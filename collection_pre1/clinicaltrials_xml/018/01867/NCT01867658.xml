	<brief_title>Progel® Pleural Air Leak Sealant ( PALS ) Video Robotic Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , open label , multi-center clinical study design ass safety Progel® PALS product , include Extended Applicator Spray Tip , use Video Assisted Robotic Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery . The study treat approximately 105 evaluable subject 15 U.S. site . All subject provide inform consent prior enrollment study . Patients meet initial screen criterion visible pleural air leak require treatment sealant , standard closure technique use ( standard suture , staple device supply hospital thoracoscopic surgery ) eligible study participation . If subject treat , surgeon utilize Progel® PALS sit originally treat standard technique .</detailed_description>
