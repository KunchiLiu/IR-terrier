	<detailed_description>The dosage Temozolomide Thalidomide fix , dose Lomustine phase I MTD high dose study MTD attain . All 3 drug take mouth home . Each treatment cycle last 8 week . Temozolomide take day 6 week follow two week . You take thalidomide every day entire 8-week cycle . Thalidomide also take near bedtime , usually 30 45 minute temozolomide dose . You take 2 dos lomustine every 8 week . You take first dose lomustine Day 1 8-week cycle . You take second dose , half big first dose , Day 29 ( day first 4 week ) 8-week cycle . The dose lomustine also base height weight . Lomustine swallow chew . A maximum 30 patient enrol ,</detailed_description>

Pts must brain lesion =/ &gt; 1.0cm long dimension magnetic resonance ( MRI ) spiral compute tomography ( CT ) , MRI feasible &gt; 0.5cm MRI 3D image . Patients with/without extracranial disease eligible . Measurable extracranial disease require . Lesions consider nonmeasurable include : &lt; 1.0 cm MRI Spiral CT , Bone lesion , Leptomeningeal disease , Ascites , Pleural/pericardial effusion , Lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis , Abdominal mass confirm follow image technique , Cystic lesion , lesion previously irradiate area , unless new growth document . 3 . Age &gt; /= 18 year age . 4 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status : 0 1 5 . No 1 prior chemotherapy regimen prior chemotherapy brain metastasis . No prior treatment continuous daily dose temozolomide ; prior immunotherapy surgical resection permit . Patients prior history whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) permit provide measurable lesion document growth post radiation new disease . 6 . ( # 5 continue ) Progression lesion treat WBRT must show 2 post treatment brain image least 3 week apart . Progression disease also consider patient increase lesion per MRI brain obtain 4 week WBRT complete compare baseline MRI obtain less 1 week prior start radiation . Lesions treat SRS must respond progress . 7 . The following time period must elapse since prior therapy : 3 week since surgical resection stereotactic radiosurgery ; 4weeks since prior whole brain radiation therapy ; 6 week since prior nitrosureas mitomycin C. Biologic agent use adjuvant vaccine cellular therapy require 4week wash period patient meet eligibility criterion . 8 .
