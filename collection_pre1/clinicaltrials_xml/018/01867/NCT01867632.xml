	<brief_summary>The goal present study definitely determine whether use acellular dermal matrix ( ADM ) primary cleft palate repair decrease rate fistula formation . Although individual study describe promising advantage use cleft palate surgery , consensus currently exist . Without concrete evidence , one must question whether increased cost , time potential patient risk ( human derive tissue ) patient justifies use primary cleft palate repair .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Observational study compose prospective cohort group receive ADM compare retrospective historical cohort group without ADM . Objectives study : Primary objective : The primary objective study determine whether ADM would lower incidence palatal fistula patient undergoing primary cleft palate repair .

	<criteria>Children diagnose Veau class II IV cleft palates undergo Furlow palatoplasty ADM age 3 month 3 year include study . Selection base parent 's willingness allow child participate study . Children diagnose craniofacial syndrome exclude study due high usual incidence palatal fistula . Children know wound healing defect , Ehler Danlos syndrome , Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum , exclude study due inherent collagen defect consequently incidence palatal fistula . Children Veau class I cleave palate need/needed surgical technique Furlow palatoplasty exclude study .</criteria>
