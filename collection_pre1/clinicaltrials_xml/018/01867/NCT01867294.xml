	<brief_title>Spironolactone Preventing Rash Patients With Advanced Cancer Receiving Panitumumab Cetuximab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility administration topical spironolactone versus placebo patient population . ( Study I ) II . To explore efficacy topical spironolactone prevent/attenuate rash EGFR inhibitor . ( Study II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore efficacy spironolactone versus placebo . ( Study I ) II . To describe efficacy Modified Preemptive Therapy Regimen intervention . ( Study II ) III . To explore adverse event profile spironolactone Modified Preemptive Therapy Regimen intervention . ( Study II ) IV . To explore patient report outcomes patient use spironolactone Modified Preemptive Therapy Regimen intervention . ( Study II ) V. To explore long term ( 8 week ) effect 4 week treatment spironolactone Modified Preemptive Therapy Regimen intervention EFGR induce rash . ( Study II ) OUTLINE : STUDY I : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients apply spironolactone topically face twice daily ( BID ) 4 week . ARM II : Patients apply placebo topically face BID 4 week . STUDY II : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients apply spironolactone topically face body BID 4 week ARM II : Patients undergo modify preemptive therapy regimen consist skin moisturizer topically BID , sunscreen topically go outside , hydrocortisone topically daily ( QD ) , doxycycline orally ( PO ) BID 4 week .</detailed_description>
