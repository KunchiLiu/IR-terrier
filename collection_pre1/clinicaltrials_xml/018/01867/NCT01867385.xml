	<brief_summary>Background : - Fatigue common often disable symptom people chronic liver disease . Its cause well understood . Sleep disturbance may play role people cirrhosis , factor study people stage liver disease . This study look body 's circadian rhythm ( internal clock ) see problem rhythms contribute fatigue . It look cause mechanisms fatigue people chronic liver disease compare people without fatigue . Objectives : - To study reason fatigue people chronic liver disease . Eligibility : - &lt; TAB &gt; Individuals least 18 year age chronic liver disease . - &lt; TAB &gt; Participants without fatigue may enroll . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They 2-day inpatient stay study . - For 7 day inpatient stay , participant keep sleep diary . They record caffeine alcohol consumption , medicine , exercise , sleep nap . They also wear actigraph measure activity level . - During inpatient stay , participant answer question fatigue sleep habit . They regular blood test 24 hour . Their body temperature also monitor . During night , sleep study look well poorly sleep . - Treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fatigue common symptom patient chronic liver disease , severely impact quality life . Thus far , scant knowledge cause fatigue population , almost specific treatment fatigue find effective clinical trial . Sleep disturbance alteration plasma melatonin profile document patient cirrhosis , remain largely unstudied patient earlier stage liver disease . Up 50 patient enrol case-control study physiology fatigue patient chronic liver disease . This descriptive study , explore concept fatigue may result circadian rhythms central nervous system sync circadian rhythm peripheral organ , i.e . unsynchronized central peripheral clock .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Adults ( age &gt; 18 ) chronic liver disease etiology EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Treatment medication supplement frequently associate fatigue , interferon ( within last four month ) , betablockers , calcium channel blocker , benzodiazepine , sedate antihistamine , antidepressant , antipsychotic , melatonin . In select instance , patient use medication may enrol , opinion investigator , fatigue clearly unrelated medication . Untreated uncontrolled comorbidities influence fatigue , include thyroid disorder ( TSH &gt; 5 mcIU/mL ) , anemia ( Hemoglobin &lt; 11 g/dL ) , major depression , active substance abuse condition determine enrol physician . Comorbidities adequately control exclude patient . Untreated sleep disorder obstructive sleep apnea restless leg syndrome Decompensated cirrhosis ( encephalopathy , gastrointestinal bleeding , ascites , bilirubin &gt; 2 ) within last six month Patients plan travel outside time zone study period Known suspect significant gastrointestinal motility disorder , obstruction , structure disease Pregnancy , breastfeeding , intention become pregnant Inability provide inform consent</criteria>
