	<brief_summary>Background : - Malaria disease spread mosquito . Researchers look vaccine prevent mosquito transmit malaria people . They want test vaccine call Pfs25-EPA/Alhydrogel may help stop malaria parasite develop mosquito . When mosquito bite vaccinate person , vaccine prevent parasites develop mosquito . As result , mosquito spread malaria next person bite . However , vaccine directly prevent people vaccinate get sick malaria . Researchers want test vaccine people live rural Mali . To , study compare symptom blood test participant receive either study vaccine regular hepatitis B/meningococcal vaccine . Objectives : - To see Pfs25-EPA/Alhydrogel safe effective malaria vaccine . Eligibility : - Healthy volunteer 18 45 year age live Bancoumana , Mali . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood test . - Participants separate two group . One group Pfs25-EPA/Alhydrogel test study vaccine . The group regular Hepatitis B vaccine series , meningococcal vaccine . - In study vaccine group , participant either low dose high dose . For low dose , two vaccine shot 1 year . For high dose , four vaccine shot 14 month . - In vaccine group , participant Hepatitis B vaccine series , meningococcal vaccine accord standard dose schedule . - All participant provide regular blood sample test study . - Participants develop malaria study participate evaluation transmission parasite development malaria parasite person mosquito via transmission assay . They allow mosquito ( disease ) bite control clinic setting . This let researcher see vaccine stop mosquito carry malaria people .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A vaccine interrupt malaria transmission would valuable tool local elimination eradication disease . Pfs25 , surface antigen ookinetes mosquito stage P. falciparum , lead candidate malaria transmission block vaccine . Recombinant Pfs25 conjugate Pseudomonas aeruginosa ExoProtein A ( EPA ) , adjuvanted Alhydrogel . This dose escalating , double-blind , randomize control trial determine safety immunogenicity vaccine malaria expose adult . One hundred twenty ( 120 ) subject enrol randomized receive low dose ( 16 g conjugate Pfs25 , n=10 ) , high dose ( 47 g conjugate Pfs25 , n=50 ) , comparator vaccine ( Euvax B first 3 vaccination , Menactra vaccine fourth vaccination , n=10 2 vaccination , n=50 4 vaccination ) . Enrollment within high dose group stagger additional safety . The low dose match comparator cohort ( Group 1 ) receive 2 vaccine dos give 0 2 month . For rest subject , 3 dos give 0 , 2 , 4 month dosing interval , fourth ( booster ) dose give 12 month follow third dose start subsequent transmission season . Subjects follow 12 month follow last vaccination . Safety outcomes local systemic adverse event ( AEs ) serious adverse event ( SAEs ) . Immunogenicity outcomes antibody response measure ELISA recombinant Pfs25 EPA , B cell response . Functional activity induce antibody assessed direct transmission block assay ( direct skin feed , direct membrane feeding assay ) conduct Malaria Research Training Center ( MRTC ) Mali standard membrane feed assay conduct National Institute Allergy Infectious Diseases ( NIAID ) United States .</detailed_description>
