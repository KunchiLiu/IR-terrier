A major limitation previous study symptoms patient undergoing cancer treatment evaluate symptom change time change one symptom influence patient QoL . Furthermore , compel evidence exist cancer patient receive adequate symptom management palliative care course illness [ 2-4 ] . A barrier appropriate symptom management lack intervention support patient effectively symptom management self-management . Within current health system , patient get limited help symptom health problem . This problem accentuate short hospital stay consultation . Side-effects treatment usually bad discharge hospital , patient spend time home , leave considerable symptom distress without much assistance .

Therefore , important next step aim study expand test Connect follow , benefit large group patient . Research repeatedly show FCs cancer patient experience many problem , symptom burden [ 8 ] . However , relationship patient FCs symptom problem yet sufficiently understood . Affecting one may also affect , intervention support FCs could also support patient vice versa , reduce symptom distress [ 9 ] . Therefore , extend Connect support cancer patient FCs , test effect patient FC outcome . Thus specific aim Phase II project : 1 . Develop test effect extend Connect module support ( 1 ) cancer patient ( 2 ) FCs patient FC outcome . Research Questions : Following cancer patient FCs 3 repeat measure 6 month , study test main interaction effect provide Connect patient , FCs simultaneously : - Primary patient outcome term symptom distress , HRQoL , depression , fatigue sleep . - Primary FC outcomes term symptom distress , QoL , depression , fatigue , sleep care giver burden . - Secondary , intermediate , patient FC outcome term self-efficacy , social support , self-reported health care utilization . - To good understand effect may occur , explore relationship primary patient FC outcome ; primary secondary outcome vary co-vary across experimental condition . Additional research question : - How patient FCs use Connect ? What frequency use component use ? - What patient ' FCs perception usefulness ease use Connect ?</detailed_description>
