	<brief_summary>Background : - Enzalutamide hormone therapy use treat advanced prostate cancer . It give chemotherapy surgery help body destroy cancer cell . A new possible way treat prostate cancer use vaccine may help stimulate immune system . It help white blood cell recognize kill cancer cell around prostate . Researchers want see whether vaccine , give enzalutamide , effective treating advance prostate cancer enzalutamide alone . Objectives : - To compare safety effectiveness enzalutamide without vaccine therapy advance prostate cancer . Eligibility : - Men least 18 year age advance castration-resistant prostate cancer . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . Imaging study use monitor cancer treatment . - Participants separate two group . One group enzalutamide study vaccine . The group enzalutamide alone . - All participant take enzalutamide day . They take drug 4-week cycle treatment . - Treatment monitor frequent blood test image study . Participants continue take study drug long cancer grow side effect severe . - The vaccine group participant also new study vaccine . They single injection first day first study cycle . There regular booster injection afterward . There one day 15 first cycle , first day second cycle . The vaccine give every 4 week next four cycle , every 12 week ( every 3 cycle ) thereafter . Participants continue study vaccine long cancer grow side effect severe .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enzalutamide With Without Vaccine Therapy Advanced Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Enzalutamide well-tolerated , modern androgen receptor antagonist ( ARA ) enhance anti-tumor activity compare previous ARAs . Phase III trial demonstrate 4.8 month improvement survival 37 % risk reduction death metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer ( mCRPC ) patient previous docetaxel . - PROSTVAC therapeutic cancer vaccine design induce anti-tumor immune response . In randomized control Phase 2 trial , PROSTVAC therapy associate prolongation survival 8.5 month men metastatic castrateresistant prostate cancer . An international Phase 3 trial on-going . - Preclinical data demonstrate hormonal therapy ARAs enhance immune response multiple mechanism . Specifically , group show enzalutamide increase thymic production na ( SqrRoot ) T-cells , could activate cancer vaccine . Together , data provide important rationale combine enzalutamide PSA-TRICOM mCRPC . - Data clinical trial therapy suggest well tolerate without overlap toxicity . Objective : -Determine PSA-TRICOM combine enzalutamide increase time progression ( defined Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group 2 criterion , incorporate section 5.2 ) chemotherapy-naive metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer patient compare enzalutamide alone . Design : - The study randomize chemotherapy-naive , mCRPC patient either enzalutamide alone enzalutamide PSA-TRICOM . Enzalutamide give standard dose 160 mg daily . - PSA-TRICOM administered identical Phase III dose vaccine give week 1 ( vaccinia-PSA-TRICOM , 2x10 ( 8 ) unit subcutaneously ) week 3 , 5 monthly fowlpox-vaccine ( 1x10 ( 9 ) unit subcutaneously ) . - After complete 6 month vaccine , fowlpox-vaccine ( 1x10 ( 9 ) unit subcutaneously administer every 3 month . Patients treat radiographic progression scan use Prostate Cancer Working Group Criteria . Eligibility : - mCRPC patient rise PSA progressive disease despite castration level testosterone . - Chemotherapy-na ( SqrRoot ) minimal symptom related prostate cancer . - Patients history autoimmune disease , brain/leptomeningeal metastasis , second malignancy within 3 year enrollment , severe co-morbid condition exclude . - Patients receive abiraterone exclude - Patients stratify base previous immunotherapy use cancer treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients must histologically cytologically confirm prostate cancer confirm either Laboratory Pathology NIH Clinical Center Walter Reed National Military Medical Center Bethesda prior start study . If pathologic specimen available , patient may enroll pathologist report show histological diagnosis prostate cancer clinical course consistent disease . Castrate testosterone level ( &lt; 50ng/dl 1.7nmol /L ) Metastatic disease document one following : Metastatic bone disease image study , Soft tissue disease document CT/MRI , Progressive disease study entry define one follow criterion occur set castrate level testosterone : i. Radiographic progression define new enlarge bone lesion grow lymph node disease , consistent prostate cancer OR ii . PSA progression define sequence rise value separate &gt; 1 week ( 2 separate increase value minimum 2ng/ml ( PCWG2 PSA eligibility criterion ) If patient flutamide , PSA progression document 4 week withdrawal . The requirement 46 week withdrawal period follow discontinuation flutamide , nilutamide bicalutamide applies patient drug least prior 6 month . For patient must stop bicalutamide , nilutamide flutamide day prior enrollment . Asymptomatic mildly symptomatic prostate cancer ; use regularly schedule opiate analgesic prostate cancerrelated pain Patients must agree continue continuation androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) gonadotropinreleasing hormone analogue/antagonist bilateral orchiectomy Age great equal 18 year . ECOG performance status less equal 1 ( Karnofsky great equal 80 % ) . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/mcL platelet great equal 100,000/mcL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit ; patient Gilbert syndrome , total bilirubin less equal 3.0mg/dL AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) less equal 2.5 time institutional upper limit normal creatinine within 1.5 X normal institutional limit , OR creatinine clearance great equal 60 mL/min/1.73 ( 2 ) patient creatinine level institutional normal CockcroftGault Equation The effect enzalutamide alone combination PSATRICOM develop human fetus unknown .
