	<brief_summary>Background : - Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis ( HAM/TSP ) infection spinal cord . The infection cause virus know cause cancer like leukemia lymphoma . It cause weaken leg . Researchers want see raltegravir , drug treat human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , use treat HAM/TSP . They see drug reduce amount virus blood people HAM/TSP . Objectives : - To see raltegravir reduce viral load people HAM/TSP . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age HAM/TSP . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood sample collect . Imaging study perform . A lumbar puncture also take . - Participants take study drug twice day 6 month . They note dose study diary , well side effect . - At 6-month visit , participant stop take study drug . They physical exam blood sample , well test . - Participants two exams 9 month 15 month start study drug . They physical exam blood sample , well test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : In pilot study , wish determine effect Raltegravir , clinically approve HIV-1 integrase inhibitor , HTLV-1 proviral load ( PVL ) patient HTLV-1 associate myelopathy / tropical spastic paraparesis ( HAM/TSP ) . We also provide safety tolerability information Raltegravir use condition examine correlation immune activation marker HAM/TSP effect Raltegravir PVL . Study population : HAM/TSP , relentlessly progressive disable myelopathy , occur 3 % HTLV-1 infected subject . It result immune-mediated bystander damage neural tissue association elevate PVL . In fact , high PVL consider main risk factor develop HAM/TSP risk disease rise exponentially PVL exceed 1 % . Currently effective treatment HAM/TSP . There evidence active HTLV-1 replication , retroviral life cycle new virus integration , occur vivo contributes total HTLV-1 PVL infected subject . Recently show Raltegravir could inhibit cell-free cell-to-cell transmission HTLV-1 vitro . Given substantial clinical experience use HIV-1 infection particularly excellent safety profile , agent attractive therapeutic option patient HAM/TSP , either alone combination immunomodulatory treatment . In pilot study wish determine effect Raltegravir vivo HTLV-1 PVL immune activation marker patient HAM/TSP . Design : In 15 month single center , single arm , open label , baseline versus treatment pilot clinical trial , sixteen subject HAM/TSP receive Raltegravir 400mg mouth twice daily initial 6 month treatment phase , follow additional 9 month post treatment phase . Outcome measure collect every 3 month duration study . Outcome measure : The primary outcome measure HTLV-1 proviral load , measure quantitative PCR . Secondary outcome measure include safety tolerability Raltegravir , assess clinical exam standardize neurological disability scale well clinical laboratory study . In addition , viral immunologic outcome measure investigate impact Raltegravir HTLV-1 biology effect immune function measure include HTLV-1 proviral load different lymphocyte population , number long terminal repeat ( LTR ) circle HTLV-1 mRNA expression level freshly isolate PBMC , assay spontaneous lymphoproliferation T-cell phenotype analysis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 18 year old Diagnosis HAM/TSP define WHO criterion , include positive HTLV1 EIA confirmatory Western Blot . Patient must willing able comply aspects trial design followup . Patients must able provide inform consent If able become pregnant father child , agree commit use reliable/accepted method birth control ( i.e . hormonal contraception ( birth control pill , inject hormone , vaginal ring ) , intrauterine device , barrier method spermicide ( diaphragm spermicide , condom spermicide ) surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , tubal ligation , vasectomy ) duration treatment arm study EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Alternative diagnosis explain neurological disability Clinically significant medical disorder , judgment investigator might expose patient undue risk harm confound study outcomes prevent patient complete study . Examples condition include limited poorly control cardiopulmonary condition congestive heart failure , asthma uncontrolled hypertension . Patient receive immunomodulatory/immunosuppressive therapy ( include steroid ) precede 6 month . Patient know myopathy risk factor CK elevation include drug know cause myopathy rhabdomyolysis . Pregnant lactating woman . Patient receive investigational drug within 6 month enrollment Positive serological evidence HIV , HTLVII , Hepatitis B C. Abnormal screening/baseline blood test exceed limit define : Serum alanine transaminase ( ALT ) aspartate transaminase ( AST ) level great 3 time upper limit normal value ; total bilirubin &gt; 2.0mg/dl ; Serum amylase lipase level great twice upper limit normal value ; serum creatine phosphokinase ( CK ) level exceed 3 xULN confirm repeat test 2 week . Platelet count &lt; 75,000/mm ( 3 ) Serum creatinine level &gt; 2.0 mg/dl</criteria>
