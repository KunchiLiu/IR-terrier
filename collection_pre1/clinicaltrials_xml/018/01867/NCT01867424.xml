	<brief_summary>Background : - Prostate cancer common cancer type among men . Some prostate cancer respond hormonal therapy . However , cell characteristic prostate cancer cause respond well therapy . Researchers want see gadoxetate , contrast agent use help identify damage liver tissue , help tell type prostate cancer apart . It may able identify man type prostate cancer hormone therapy may work well . Objectives : - To see gadoxetate help identify different type prostate cancer image study . Eligibility : - Men least 18 year age prostate cancer . Participants surgery either remove prostate take tumor tissue sample . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood sample collect . - Participants magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan low torso . They receive gadoxetate MRI scan . - Participants surgery sample tumor cell collect . Those biopsy provide cell biopsy study . - Treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - Prostate cancer common non-cutaneous malignancy among men western world . Prognostic biomarkers would useful stratify patient different treatment . - The expression testosterone membrane transporter , OATP1B3 , associate short time progression hormonal ablation therapy shorter overall survival prostate cancer patient . 52 % localized prostate cancer lesion express OATP1B3 , 92 % prostate cancer metastases require hormonal ablation treatment , express OATP1B3 soft tissue lesion . Expression OATP1B3 also correlate Gleason grade . - Current imaging method predict treatment failure resistance . - Gadoxetate disodium ( Gd-EOB-DTPA ) ( Eovist , Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals Inc. Pittsburgh , PA ) MR image agent FDA-approved gadolinium chelate detect hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , normal hepatocytes express OATP1B3 hepatocellular carcinoma . However , HCC take Eovist show express OATP1B3 . - Eovist may useful evaluate OATP1B3 status patient prostate cancer may therefore serve prognostic treatment biomarker . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : -Evaluate uptake retention Eovist prostate cancer . ELIGIBILTY : - Male subject great equal 18 year old - ECOG Performance score 0 2 - Subjects clinically localized prostate cancer must image guide biopsy confirm prostate cancer sufficient tissue available OATP1B3 IHC . - Subjects advanced disease fail hormone therapy sufficient tissue soft tissue metastatic bone lesion ( measure great equal to1.5cm diameter CT MRI scan ) available OATP1B3 IHC . -Subjects , tissue available , must soft tissue metastatic bone lesion biopsied willing undergo percutaneous biopsy obtain tissue OATP1B3 expression . DESIGN : - This pilot study accrue 25 subject divide two arm : 10 evaluable subject localize prostate cancer 15 evaluable subject advance disease - Each subject receive single IV dose Eovist bolus injection - All subject undergo MRI prior immediately , 10 , 20 60 minute post-Eovist injection</detailed_description>
