	<brief_summary>The purpose program research understand perception dynamic spectral property speech hearing-impaired listener , long-term goal improve speech understanding individual adverse listening condition . The propose research compare performance normally-hearing hearing-impaired listener measure speech understand presence different type signal distortion speech understanding signal enhance spectral dynamic . A computational model base amount potential information available speech use quantify difference speech intelligibility due hearing status stimulus characteristic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This behavioral study human auditory perception . Each experiment study involve prospective data collection three type listener . The experimental listener people sensorineural hearing loss control listeners either subject normal hear normal-hearing listener hear loss simulate use spectrally-shaped broadband noise . The tasks subject study involve either listen synthesized sound earphone seat comfortably sound-treated booth , make response indicate subject 's auditory perception sound touch specific area touch-screen terminal ; , listen record , acoustically modify syllable , word , sentence earphones make response indicate subject 's identification .</detailed_description>
