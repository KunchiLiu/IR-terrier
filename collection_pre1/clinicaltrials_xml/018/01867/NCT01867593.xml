	<brief_summary>This research study prospective pilot study . The purpose pilot clinical study obtain preliminary data support reason large clinical trial test clinical effectiveness investigational intervention . `` Investigational '' mean role MET-PET scan still study research doctor try find . It also mean FDA approve intervention type cancer . In research study , investigator evaluate whether MET-PET scan value predict response standard chemoradiation therapy participant newly-diagnosed glioblastoma . A standard treatment glioblastoma treatment combination radiation therapy chemotherapy drug temozolomide . In PET scan , radioactive substance inject body . The scan machine find radioactive substance , tend go cancer cell . With standard PET scan , radioactive substance use FDG . FDG go many area normal brain make difficult use distinguish brain tumor normal tissue . For PET scan research study , investigator use radioactive substance call MET , instead standard substance FDG . MET get absorbed cancer cell normal brain therefore may better FDG evaluate brain tumor therefore may better FDG evaluate brain tumor response treatment . In research study , participant receive standard chemotherapy radiation therapy glioblastoma well standard MRI scan . In addition , participant undergo L- [ Methyl ] -11C Methionine Positron Emission Tomography ( MET-PET ) scan twice . The first MET-PET scan occur enrollment prior radiation therapy . The second MET-PET scan occur approximately one month completion radiation therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After agree take part research study ask undergo screening test procedure confirm eligible . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn take part research study . If test procedure recently , may may repeat . The screening process include follow : A medical history , performance status , physical exam , routine blood test , assessment tumor , diagnosis confirmation pregnancy test . If test show eligible participate research study , begin study treatment . If meet eligibility criterion , able participate research study . Within 3 week surgery undergo MET-PET scan define residual metabolic activity . After completion radiation therapy 1,3,5,7,9 11 month follow radiation therapy undergo : medical history , physical exam , assessment tumor MRI , documentation current dose steroid , blood test evaluation side effect . At one month completion radiation therapy undergo second final MET-PET scan ass response therapy . After 11 month follow-up visit , would like keep track medical condition rest life part routine care . If long see person clinic , would like call telephone year see . Keeping touch checking condition every year help u look long-term effect research study .</detailed_description>
