	<brief_summary>Background : - Some child teenager condition know conduct disorder . They often long-term chronic behavior problem , defiant behavior violence . Conduct disorder often treat antipsychotic medication . Researchers want study two type newer antipsychotic ( aripiprizole risperidone ) child adolescent conduct disorder . They look drug affect brain activity . To , give brain activity test use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . The test compare result healthy volunteer child teens others behavior problem . Objectives : - To see atypical antipsychotic affect brain activity child teenager conduct disorder . Eligibility : - Children teenager 10 18 year age conduct disorder take aripiprizole . - Children teenager 10 18 year age conduct disorder take risperidone . - Children teenager 10 18 year age conduct disorder take atypical antipsychotic . - Healthy volunteer 10 18 year age . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Parents/guardians ask question child feeling , experience , behavior . Participants also answer question feeling mood . - This study involve two visit . Each visit involve MRI scanning . - At first visit , participant memory thinking test . The test involve make decision play game . Some test use MRI scan look brain activity . - The second visit 3 5 month first visit . The test first visit repeat .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : To determine impact , indexed BOLD response , administration aripiprazole risperidone treatment Conduct Disorder ( CD ) pathophysiology CD . Study Population : Youth CD receive aripiprazole admission Boys Town Omaha , youth CD receive risperidone admission Boys Town Omaha , youth CD receive antipsychotic admission Boys Town Omaha , typically develop youth . Design : The study involve 4 ( Group : CD receive aripiprazole admission , CD receive risperidone admission , CD receive antipsychotic admission , typically develop youth ) x 2 ( Time : At admission vs. four month subsequent admission [ treatment antipsychotic group taper ] ) design . Principle dependent measure relate BOLD response index pathophysiology CD . Outcome Measures : Principle dependent measure relate BOLD response index pathophysiology CD . In addition , assessment symptom severity collect , measurement cognitive function .</detailed_description>
