	<brief_summary>Phase IV , open-label , randomize , two-arm , multi-center study patient metastatic melanoma treatment naïve previously receive single non-immunologic therapy . Treatment Arm 1 : Patients receive two course ( four cycle ) High Dose Interleukin-2 ( HD IL-2 ) follow one course ( four dos ) ipilimumab . Treatment Arm 2 : Patients receive one course ( four dos ) ipilimumab follow two course ( four cycle ) HD IL-2 . HD IL-2 ipilimumab dose regimen comply instruction current package insert , institutional guideline , medical expertise treat physician . However , neither ipilimumab HD IL-2 dose reduce . If necessary , dose either hold permanently discontinue ( per package insert instruction ) . Protocol specific dose guidance include 12PLK02 Work Instructions . Patients schedule four response assessment . Response assessment timing target fall within follow time point : 5-11 week , 13-19 week , 24-30 week one year initiate therapy either treatment arm . Timing response assessment may adjust facilitate clinical procedure treatment decision . Patient treatment tolerability safety event monitor manage enrol 12PLK02 study . Patients receive HD IL-2 12PLK02 study enrol PROCLAIM study ( Registry Protocol 10PLK13 ) collection long-term assessment data , include response disease status treatment decision . Patient treatment data enter PROCLAIM database , minimum target 2 year potentially 5 year , patient complete 12PLK02 study .</brief_summary>
