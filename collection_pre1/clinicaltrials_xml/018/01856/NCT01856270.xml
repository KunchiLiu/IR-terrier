	<detailed_description>Research Hypothesis Aims : The ultimate aim research determine whether early treatment use amitriptyline prevent development chronic headache TBI . This proposal preliminary work give indication effect amitriptyline provide information need design definitive study efficacy amitriptyline prevention chronic post-traumatic headache . Specific Aim 1 conduct two-arm open-label study examine effect preventive treatment amitriptyline frequency severity headache mild TBI compare see observational study natural history headache mild TBI . Specific Aim 2 collect data need design Phase III study , include estimate effect size , variability number headache day mild TBI , determine desirable initiation date preventive treatment ( e.g. , week 1 month 1 injury ) . Specific Aim 3 examine feasibility headache diary use individual mild TBI . Specific Aim 4 establish safety tolerability amitriptyline prevention headache mild TBI . Hypothesis : Preventive treatment early headache amitriptyline mild TBI result decrease prevalence recurrent headache ( percent participant least 1 headache/week ) severe headache ( percent participant headache average pain 5 high ) three month compare frequency severity headache follow natural history study receive usual care . Data Collection Measures : Data collection occur enrollment , clinic visit , Day 180 . An examiner blind group assignment administer measure Clinic Visit 1 cognition compare group time point ; assessment point unblinded . Primary Outcome Measure : Frequency severity headaches 90 day study initiation . Secondary Measures : Secondary measure Brief Pain Inventory , Analog Pain Scale , Pain Sites , Headache Impact Test-6 ( HIT-6 ) , Insomnia Severity Index ( ISI ) , Patient Health Questionnaire-9 ( PHQ-9 ) , General Anxiety Disorder - 7 Item Scale ( GAD-7 ) , Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test—Consumption ( AUDIT-C ) , Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire ( RPQ ) , EuroQol , Health Survey Short Form-12® ( SF-12 ) , Satisfaction Life Scale . Caffeine use drug use question ask model AUDIT question . Additional measure obtain baseline characterize injury type severity , medication use , accompany disorder . Headache Diary : The subject ask fill headache diary day study rate frequency severity headache well simple headache characterization . Enrollment Randomization : Informed consent obtain participant approve Human Subjects Division University Washington . Subjects randomize one two group ( Group 1 : early start vs. Group 2 : delayed start ) use computerize blocked randomization , stratify headache severity ( average severity &lt; 4 vs. &gt; 5 ) . Medication administration dose adjustment : The study drug , amitriptyline , dispense medication container clearly mark dosage instruction take bedtime daily ( separate container 10 mg , 25 mg , 50 mg ) . Once randomized , Group 1 participant start one 10 mg capsule evening . The dosage adjust upwards 25 mg daily Week 2 maximum 50 mg daily Week 3 . Group 2 participant assess Clinic Visit 1 ( Day 30 ) current headache . If participant continue headache ( new bad pre-injury ) , he/she ramp-up schedule study drug start Day 30 . Those group 2 headache day 30 follow phone headache diary throughout study include outcome . If perceive side effect study drug intolerable time study , subject ask decrease dosage half pill new prescription arrive . If side effect remain intolerable 3 day low dose , subject discontinue study drug follow study . Regardless dose , schedule visit test continue . Participants allow use rescue medication need headache . Compliance : Each dosage separate pill container clearly mark . Compliance assess weekly telephone follow-up call follow-up clinic visit . Pill count perform visit . Adequate compliance consider 80 % medication consumption . Schedule Visits : Baseline Hospital Visit . Measures administer include interim medical history form ( diagnosis , current medication ) , headache survey , pain measure , HIT-6 , PHQ-9 , ISI , RPQ , SF-12 . After completion baseline assessment , research assistant instruct participant use daily headache diary . The research assistant distribute label study drug Group 1 participant instruct use . Participants give schedule increase dose weekly . Subjects ask keep pill container turn next clinic visit . Telephone Follow-Up Calls 1-9 ( clinic visit ) . The research assistant contact participant weekly ( Telephone Follow-Up Calls 1 , 2 , 3 ) enrollment check completion headache diary confirm frequency severity headache precede week , study drug use , use rescue medication . In case adverse effect bothersome patient ( e.g. , mild sedation , dry mouth , constipation ) , dosage decrease one dosage level ½ pill per day . Clinic Visit 1 ( Day 30 ) . For participant visit , vital sign obtain . Drug container collect Group 1 headache diary collect subject . Measures administer visit include interim medical history form ( new diagnosis , change medication ) , headache survey , pain measure , HIT-6 , PHQ-9 , ISI , RPQ , SF-12 . Neuropsychological test give visit . For Group 1 , dosage decrease secondary minor adverse event interim , one study physicians meet participant decide whether maintain low dose second trial return high dose study drug . The second month 's supply study drug dispense visit . For Group 2 participant headache , medication first month treatment distribute along ramp-up schedule . Clinic Visit 2 ( Day 60 ) . Vital sign obtain . Drug container headache diary collect subject . Measures administer visit include interim medical history form ( new diagnosis , change medication ) , headache survey , pain measure , HIT-6 , PHQ-9 , ISI , RPQ , SF-12 . If dosage decrease secondary minor adverse event interim , one study physicians meet participant decide whether maintain low dose second trial return high dose study drug . The final month 's supply study drug dispense visit . Clinic Visit 3 ( Day 90 ) . This final visit subject . Vital sign obtain . Drug container headache diary collect subject . Measures administer visit include interim medical history form ( new diagnosis , change medication ) , headache survey , pain measure , HIT-6 , PHQ-9 , ISI , RPQ , SF-12 . Telephone Follow-Up Call 10 . The research assistant call subject Day 180 administer headache survey ( include HIT-6 ) record current medication . Subject Withdrawal : Subjects may discontinue study drug request subject experience adverse effect sufficient warrant withdrawal study drug , In case discontinuation , reason withdrawal record subject ask continue monitor headache use headache diary . Data Analysis Study Sample Size Rationale : In recent observational study , investigator observe people new bad headache baseline assessment mild TBI , 35 % 1 headache per week 3 month similar fraction average headache pain severity 6 0 ( pain ) 10 ( bad pain imaginable ) scale . The study 's two end point : 1 ) reduction percent people baseline headaches one headache per week 3 month ; 2 ) reduction percent people baseline headache experience headache severity 6 scale 0 10 3 month . It necessary 65 case follow 3 month order 80 % power reject null hypothesis 35 % headache rate amitriptyline take preventive yield 21 % subject 1 headache per week ( 40 % reduction percentage people frequent headache 3 month ) . Similar number need confirm like reduction percent participant severe headache ( average pain 6 great ) . These base 1-sided significance level 0.05 . Allowing 10 % attrition ( 7 subject ) , investigator recruit randomize 72 participant . Based previous natural history study , investigator expect 104 case per year new bad headache baseline assessment . The investigator expect 60 % meet eligibility criteria 60 % consent participate , yield 37 case per year randomize . Aim 1 . The primary intent-to-treat analysis determine proportion participant frequent ( 1 headache per week ) severe ( average pain 6 high ) headache combine arm 3 month . Each proportion compare rate record observational study use normal approximation binomial ( one-sided chi-squared test ) . In previous observational study , investigator observe 35 % least 1 headache per week 36 % headaches average pain least 6 scale 0 10 . A one-sided significance level 0.05 use . The investigator also examine evidence differential benefit amitriptyline start baseline 1 month help decide use Phase III trial pilot suggest worthwhile . Aim 2 . Descriptive statistic use ( mean , standard deviation , proportion ) help plan Phase II trial . Aim 3 ( feasibility use headache diary ) . This address examine number participant use diary , 10 % miss data , report different value phone call show diary . Different modes complete diary ( paper , smart phone web application ) study see user friendly population . Aim 4 . Descriptive statistic use summarize occurrence adverse event . The investigator estimate impact amitriptyline cognition compare neuropsychological performance 1 month start drug baseline start drug 1-month assessment . The mean difference test calculate 95 % confidence interval .</detailed_description>
