	<brief_summary>AVMs abnormal collection blood vessel occur part body include lung . These blood vessel weaken rupture anytime cause bleed massive , leading life-threatening condition . Pulmonary AVMs occur 40 % patient HHT . Each patient may average 5 AVMs .Rupture AVM lead massive bleeding lung , stroke infection brain . In order prevent complication , patient HHT routinely examine pulmonary AVMs treatment embolization recommend . AVMs main blood vessel artery supply blood collection blood vessel . The way treat AVMs cut blood supply process call embolization . Embolization standard medical procedure do stop prevent hemorrhage ( bleed ) AVM . It involve block artery supply blood AVM insert foreign body , blood vessel supply blood AVM . Standard device use embolization include coil ( make stainless steel platinum ) . These device usually good success rate block artery supply blood AVM . However , AVMs embolized standard device may reopen time . This call reperfusion require repeat embolization procedure . For embolization pulmonary AVMs St. Michael 's Hospital , Nester coil use . In study , would like compare Nester coil new coil device call Interlock Fibered IDC Occlusion System . Both coil approve use Canada , however cost IDC coil limit use hospital . Compared Nester coil , IDC coil make remove repositioned place correctly . The coil also allow tight pack helps prevent reperfusion . This study compare success rate embolization Interlock™ Fibered IDC™ Occlusion System ( IDC coil ) Nester coil .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reperfusion Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformations After Embolotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation ( AVMs ) lead life-threatening complication . These complication prevent pre-symptomatic embolization . The Interlock™ Fibered IDC™ Occlusion System coil ( IDC ) new device might effective embolizing pulmonary AVMs . This study investigate efficacy Interlock™ Fibered IDC™ Occlusion System compare rate reperfusion use Nestor coil ( standard coil use participate centre ) versus Interlock™ Fibered IDC™ Occlusion , randomize AVM . Rationale Reperfused AVMs put patient risk pulmonary AVM complication . As , AVMs require repeat embolotherapy therefore patient subject radiation , contrast hospitalization . A number device study currently use embolization pulmonary AVMs include coil ( stainless steel , platinum ) plug ( Amplatzer plug ) . The immediate technical success rate nearly 100 % , long-term reperfusion occurrence approximately 15 % treat AVMs 30 % patient . The IDC coil characteristic may lead reduce reperfusion rate . No study IDC coil report date management pulmonary AVMs . Safety IDC coil demonstrate organ . Embolization procedure IDC coil similar embolization device , term fluoroscopy time use contrast load , procedural complication rate . Background Pulmonary AVMs present approximately 40 % patient hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia ( HHT ) , mean five pulmonary AVMs per patient . Pulmonary AVMs lead life-threatening debilitating complication , massive haemoptysis , spontaneous haemothorax , stroke cerebral abscess . Fortunately , complication preventable , screen HHT patient preventative treatment pulmonary AVMs , summarize recent decision analysis . The International HHT Guidelines recommend routine screen HHT patient pulmonary AVMs , preventative transcatheter embolotherapy significant pulmonary AVMs . Most publish data report outcomes stainless steel platinum coil , few detachable balloon Amplatzer plug . Even good success rate , reperfusion generally report range 15 % embolized AVMs routine embolization use stainless steel platinum coil . To date , comparative study stainless steel platinum coil show significant difference outcomes . PLAN OF INVESTIGATION Study Hypothesis The device interest local characteristic include well positioning controlled release , together tight packing , may lead superior outcome reduce cost well radiation time . Therefore hypothesized IDC coil associate less reperfusion standard Nestor coil , present therapeutic advantage Nestor coil . Objectives Primary Objective Reperfusion AVM assess 1-year follow-up post-embolization . If insufficient involution ( &lt; 70 % volume ) lesion , AVM consider reperfused care accord best clinical practice . Follow image per usual practice/guidelines . If participant develops complication suspect due pulmonary AVMs first year follow-up period , reassessment arrange accord current clinical practice protocol . If evidence early follow-up ongoing AVM perfusion lack aneurismal involution , AVM consider `` reperfused '' . Secondary Objective Reported secondary outcome include fluoroscopy time , contrast volume require , procedural time complication rate . STUDY DESIGN Study Population All adult patient attend Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia ( HHT ) clinic , require embolization procedure pulmonary AVMs , meet inclusion exclusion criterion consider eligible study . The Toronto HHT Centre large well-characterized HHT population ( approximately 1000 patient ) , large population Canada , allow feasible recruitment . It estimate approximately 30 new patient undergo embolization per year , comprise approximately 150 AVMs . Enrollment Potential study participant identify Toronto HHT Centre Database , IRB approve comprehensive database capture clinical information patient express interest participate HHT relate research study and/or HHT Clinic . Potential participant pre- screened eligibility upon determination approach study participation . The study initially present eligible patient treat physician member HHT clinic team , introduce study personnel patient order give additional information include obtain informed consent . Randomization Each participant receive unique randomization list . The Investigators first determine number pulmonary AVMs embolotherapy require per participant . Each treatable AVM reference anatomically assign number start one continue sequential order . The Study Coordinator match list pre determine randomization list . Each AVM randomize one two follow treatment allocation : 1 . AVM Allocation I : Standard embolization procedure Nestor Coil 2 . AVM Allocation II : Standard embolization procedure The Interlock™ Fibered IDC™ Occlusion System coil Unused randomization discard carried subsequent enrol participant . The Investigators access randomization list inform Study Coordinator AVM acquire allocate treatment device . Blinding Blinding Principal Investigator possible since Primary Investigator also treat Interventional Radiologist responsible embolotherapy procedure . Participants blind type coil receive ( Group Allocation ) particular treatable aneurysm . Outcome ascertainment bias minimize following : 1 . Coil allocation perform Study Coordinator randomization 2 . Final analysis result non-subjective obtained concrete value acquire image data reperfusion rate per coil aneurysm STUDY VISITS Visit I - Screening Baseline The study explain detail eligible participant . They give much time need review informed consent form ( ICF ) ask question may regard study . It ensure question regard study answer satisfaction eligible participant . Once satisfied prior commencement study related procedure , participant ask sign Research Ethics Board-approved write consent form study . A copy inform consent form provide patient take look leisure . After informed consent obtain , Study Coordinator screen patient study eligibility use inclusion/exclusion criterion define protocol document screen log . Reasons non-participation identify base inclusion exclusion criterion . Visit II - Procedure Pulmonary angiography embolotherapy perform use standard clinical technique . Using standard aseptic technique right common femoral vein puncture direct sonographic guidance . A 7 French sheath place connect continuous saline irrigation . The right heart pulmonary artery cannulate use 7 French Van Aman catheter . Pulmonary artery pressure obtain ; follow pulmonary angiography , either unilateral bilateral depend site PAVMs . Once confirm feed artery cannulate use Lumax catheter . After confirm position coil deploy complete occlusion feed artery achieve . Similar procedure repeat PAVMs . The catheter sheath remove haemostasis obtain . The participant sent ward monitoring . Visit III - Post Procedure Post procedure , participant follow standard clinical practice recommendation . The participant admit overnight undergo routine chest X-Ray 1-day post embolization , discharge hospital . The participant assess presence post-procedure complication . Visit IV - Month 1-3 Follow-Up As per standard clinical practice , participant require visit Dr. Faughnan HHT Clinic 1-3 month post-procedure . This visit also include single view chest X-Ray standard oxygen shunt test . If suspicion reopen embolized artery , manage per usual clinical practice . Visit V - Month 10-14 Follow-Up As per usual clinical practice , participant re-assessed 10-14 month post-procedure unenhanced low-dose CT scan chest . If suspicion reopen embolized artery , manage per usual clinical practice .</detailed_description>
