	<brief_summary>The primary objective evaluate NULOJIX® ( belatacept ) base regimen mean improve long-term graft function without increase risk immunologic graft injury avoid calcineurin inhibitor ( CNIs ) corticosteroid .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Open-Label Phase 2 Trial Steroid-Free , CNI-Free , Belatacept-Based Immunosuppressive Regimen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Taking standard anti-rejection medication long time cause serious side effect , include kidney damage . Transplant recipient take anti-rejection medication prevent immune system ( body 's natural defense system illness ) reject new kidney . Most patient receive kidney transplant must take anti-rejection medication rest life , long kidney continue work . The purpose study determine NULOJIX® ( belatacept ) , minimize serious long term side effect see anti-rejection medication still protect transplant kidney damage . The researcher also want learn safety treatment long term health transplant kidney .</detailed_description>
