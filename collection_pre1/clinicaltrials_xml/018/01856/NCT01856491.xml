	<detailed_description>The RELIANCE 4-FRONT Passive Fixation Defibrillation Lead Post Market Clinical Follow-Up Study prospective , non-randomized , multi-center , single-group , post market clinical study establish chronic safety , performance effectiveness RELIANCE 4-FRONT passive fixation defibrillation lead . A total 167 patient ( include 10 % attrition ) require evaluate Primary Endpoint . Up 10 Investigational center locate Europe Israel . Lead-related Complication-Free Rate ( CFR ) Implant 3 Months Post-Implant . Lead-related complication associate RELIANCE 4-FRONT passive fixation lead count toward endpoint . Lead-related Complication-Free Rate 3 Months 15 Months Post-Implant . Lead-related complication associate RELIANCE 4-FRONT passive fixation lead count toward endpoint . - Lead-related Complication-Free Rate 3 Months 24 Months Post-Implant - Pacing Threshold 0.5 m pulse width 3 Months Post-Implant - Sensed Amplitude 3 Months Post-Implant - Pacing Impedance 3 Months Post-Implant All endpoint assess RELIANCE 4-FRONT passive fixation lead . Clinic visit occur : - Enrollment Visit ( later 30 day prior implant procedure ) - Implant Procedure ( Day 0 ; future follow ups base date ) - Pre-Discharge Clinic Visit ( 3 - 72 hour post-implant ) - One Month Clinic Visit ( 30±7 day ) - 3 Month Clinic Visit ( 91 ± 21 day ) - 6 Month Clinic Visit ( 180 ± 30 day ) - 12 Month Clinic Visit ( 365 ± 45 day ) - 18 Month Clinic Visit ( 545± 45 day ) - 24 Month Clinic Visit ( 730 ± 45 day ) The study consider complete subject complete 24 Month follow-up study completion anticipate 2015 . Primary endpoint completion anticipate subject complete 3 Month follow-up visit . All study require visit complete clinic visit . Hypotheses test RELIANCE 4-FRONT passive fixation PMCF Study use standard statistical methodology specify detail protocol .</detailed_description>
