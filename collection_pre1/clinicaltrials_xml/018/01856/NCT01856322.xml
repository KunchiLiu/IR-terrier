	<brief_summary>Background : - Some type inflammation may increase risk cancer intestinal track . Because possibility , anti-inflammatory drug may able prevent tumor growth spread . One drug , sulindac , may helpful study . Researchers want see people surgery remove intestinal tumor advance colorectal cancer benefit sulindac . It test placebo . Objectives : - To see sulindac improve treatment outcomes people surgery advanced colorectal cancer . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age surgery advance colorectal cancer . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood sample collect . Imaging study heart lung function test may also give . - Participants separate two group . One group take sulindac . The take placebo . - Participants take sulindac placebo twice daily 2 3 week schedule surgery . Seven day surgery , stop take pill . - Participants surgery remove tumor . The surgery also remove affect organ tissue . - Participants start take pill recover surgery . They continue take sulindac placebo twice day 3 year , long tumor return .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Despite strong evidence causative role inflammatory mediator intestinal cancer , underlie mechanism remain obscure . Established evidence indicate activation Wnt/beta-catenin pathway early step malignant transformation colorectal adenoma persistent activation 90 % colorectal cancer . Activation pathway ultimately effect transcription S100A4 gene . - S100A4 transcript serum level show correlate risk recurrence colorectal cancer patient systemic metastasis find increase S100A4 transcript expression . - S100A4 may novel prognostic biomarker colorectal cancer . - Cyclooxygenase-2 key enzyme involve inflammatory response key target molecular chemoprevention colorectal adenoma prevention trial . - Recent study demonstrate mitigation Wnt/beta-catenin signal COX-2 inhibition via administration non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAID ) sulindac use vitro vivo animal model . - We hypothesize sulindac administration abrogate Wnt/beta-catenin mediate signal thus decrease S100A4 activity patient colorectal metastasis . - We propose define benefit sulindac administration patient colorectal metastasis follow resection validate use circulate S100A4 transcript novel biomarker disease recurrence .</detailed_description>
