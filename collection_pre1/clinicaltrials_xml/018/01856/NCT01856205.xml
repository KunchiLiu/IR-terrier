	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Intravenous Immunoglobulin Treat Japanese Encephalitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Japanese encephalitis ( JE ) important epidemic encephalitis worldwide , cause approximately 35-50,000 case 10-15,000 death annually . Half survivor severe neuropsychiatric sequela , pose large socio-economic burden community ill afford . JE virus ( JEV , genus flavivirus , family Flaviviridae ) 50 nm lipoprotein envelope surround nucleocapsid comprise core protein 11 KB single-stranded positive-sense RNA . The genome 5 ' 3 ' untranslated region ( UTR ) , single open reading frame encode gene three structural protein ( core - C , pre-membrane - prM envelope - E ) 7 non-structural ( NS ) proteins . The E protein critical viral attachment entry cell , along NS1 NS3 major target immune response . JEV arthropod-borne virus ( arbovirus ) , transmit enzootic cycle bird , pig vertebrate mosquito , especially Culex specie . Almost population affect part Asia infect early adulthood , small proportion ( 1 300 ) develop clinical feature . These may range non-specific febrile illness severe meningoencephalitis , seizures clinical sign raise intracranial pressure common , carry poor prognosis . In addition JEV cause poliomyelitis-like flaccid paralysis . The distribution four genotype JEV across Asia think explain clinical epidemiology , think reflection virus ' origin Southeast Asia , spread . However subtle difference genome may important determine neurological presentation flavivirus . Although vaccine JEV , available many people need , issue cost production . Progress make overcome difficulty , new vaccine use increasingly . In fact Nepal forefront use single dose live attenuate SA14-14-2 vaccine JE . However , continue spread across Asia , treatment . Interferon-α ( IFN-α ) , produce part innate response JEV infection , antiviral activity virus , think promising treatment . However , randomize placebo-controlled trial show recombinant IFN-α2a 10 million units/m2/day improve outcome . The pathogenesis JE incompletely understand , comparison positive sense RNA viral encephalitis , likely involve mixture viral cytopathology immunopathology .The role steroid JEV examine one randomized-placebo control trial Thailand , fail show benefit . IVIG currently offer one best possibility improve outcome JE . It use presumptively patient flavivirus encephalitis , include JE , postulate act two way : IVIG produce country flaviviruses endemic contains high titer specific neutralize antibody , population expose virus , thus antibody . In addition IVIG non-specific anti-inflammatory property , particularly suppression pro-inflammatory cytokine ( e.g . Kawasaki disease ) . We aim examine role IVIG JE , also look effect pro-inflammatory cytokine . The role antibody protection severe disease Japanese encephalitis : The humoral immune response JE well characterized . When disease due primary infection ( i.e . JEV first flavivirus individual infect ) rapid potent IgM response occur serum CSF within day infection . By day 7 patient elevated titer . Attempts isolate virus usually negative patient . However , failure mount IgM response associate positive virus isolation fatal outcome . Antibody JEV probably protect host restrict viral replication viraemic phase , virus cross blood brain barrier . Evidence flavivirus suggest may also limit damage establish encephalitis neutralize extracellular virus facilitate lysis infect cell antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity . In survive patient immunoglobulin class switching occur , within 30 day IgG serum CSF . Asymptomatic infection JEV also associate elevated IgM serum , CSF . In patient secondary infection ( i.e . previously infect different flavivirus , example dengue infection , yellow fever vaccination ) anamnastic response flavivirus group common antigens . This secondary pattern antibody activation characterize early rise IgG subsequent slow rise IgM . Inflammation Japanese encephalitis : At autopsy JE , brain usually edematous , congestion parenchyma . Cerebellar uncal herniation common . Histopathologically JE characterize perivascular inflammation recruitment macrophage , neutrophil lymphocyte . The basal ganglia anterior horn cell spinal cord particularly affect , provide pathological correlate Parkinsonism , poliomyelitis-like flaccid paralysis , may see . Viral antigen predominantly neuron although microglial cell , astrocytes vascular endothelial cell also infect . When survival prolong beyond 7 day acellular necrotic zone see , usually region small medium size artery surround edema . Immunopathology Japanese encephalitis : The pathogenesis JE incompletely understand , available evidence indicates , number positive sense RNA viral encephalitis include lymohoctyic chorio meningitis virus ( LCMV ) mouse Sindbis virus , dengue virus , yellow fever virus West Nile virus , immune-mediated damage well viral cytopathology . Pro-inflammatory cytokine responses Japanese encephalitis : As detailed Preliminary Studies , accumulate evidence pro-inflammatory cytokine response may make important contribution immunopathology JE . Among cytokine study , interleukin ( IL ) -6 , IL-8 chemokine ( CXC motif ) ligand ( CXCL-8 ) , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) - α appear associate fatal outcome . There also new evidence importance cytokine chemokines encephalitis cause flavivirus , particularly West Nile virus . There several mechanism pro-inflammatory response may deleterious . Recent study show IL-6 , produce neuron , microglia , astrocyte recruit macrophage response viral CNS infection , cause increased permeability blood brain barrier ( BBB ) , lead interstitial cerebral edema , raise intracranial pressure . TNF-α produce microglia , astrocyte macrophage . Its multiple pro-inflammatory property include upregulation class I II MHC expression , upregulation cellular adhesion molecule , increase permeability BBB , upregulation inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) , lead production nitric oxide ( NO ) . At high concentration NO directly toxic CNS cell , cause oxidative damage , apoptosis . Recent evidence suggest early cytokine chemokines response may also important determine whether virus even gain entry across blood brain barrier enter CNS . In one study West Nile virus infection , mice deficient Toll-like receptor 3 ( Tlr3 ) , recognize viral double stranded RNA , relatively resistant lethal infection . This associate reduced cytokine production ( particularly TNF-α IL-6 ) , increase viral load periphery , compare wild type mouse . TNF-α receptor 1 signal find vital blood brain barrier compromise upon Tlr3 stimulation virus . In addition affect virally-infected cell , inflammatory response CNS may also damage non-infected cell cause bystander cell death . The importance chemokine receptor CCR5 , ligand CCL5 ( also know RANTES , regulate activation , normally T cell express secrete ) CNS inflammation cause flavivirus show recently prominent up-regulation mouse model West Nile virus infection . This associated CNS infiltration CD4+ CD8+ T cell , Natural killer ( NK ) 1.1+ cell macrophage express receptor . The significance CCR5 pathogenesis establish mortality study infection CCR5-/- mouse rapidly uniformly fatal . Importantly , recent study ( see ) find CCL5 also elevate plasma human JE , high level associate fatal outcome . Although clinical study human JE , parallel study animal model flavivirus encephalitis suggest elevate pro-inflammatory cytokine appear important associate bad outcome JE , clear whether control strong pro-inflammatory response improve outcome . We conduct pilot double-blind placebo-controlled study safety , tolerability immunological marker efficacy IVIG child JE Nepal , follow large efficacy study . Preliminary study : Professor Solomon study JE related flavivirus since 1994 . With support group collaborator , show JEV important cause viral encephalitis Vietnam , South Southeast Asia . He show seizure raise intracranial pressure common clinical manifestation infection . In collaboration colleague Malaysia develop field-tested simple rapid diagnostic test diagnose JE rural setting occurs . This test also able distinguish JE dengue - related flavivirus circulates Asia . Although dengue good know cause hemorrhagic disease , Prof Solomon team show also important cause neurological disease . Prof Solomon also show well present encephalitis , JEV present poliomyelitis-like acute flaccid paralysis , also recently recognize adult infect West Nile virus . Based vitro vivo data , together phase I/II study human , Prof Solomon conduct randomize placebo control trial interferon α-2b child JE ( antiviral trial ever conduct JE ) . However study show improve outcome . To begin explore possible contribution viral genetic diversity clinical epidemiology JE , Prof Solomon examine molecular evolution virus across Asia , show virus probably originate Indonesia Malaysia region , evolve different genotype , recent subsequently spread across Asia . The Liverpool group recently begin examine inflammation JE . A recent pathological study human mouse model confirms importance inflammatory response , suggest may damage vascular endothelium . A study pro-inflammatory anti-inflammatory cytokine human JE show CSF level interleukin ( IL ) -6 , tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -α , interferon ( IFN ) -α chemokine CXCL8 ( IL-8 ) high patient die survive . IFN-γ nitric oxide ( NO ) also detect CSF fatal case survivor . These finding extend observation investigator TNF-α CXCL8 indicate strong pro-inflammatory response JE associate poor outcome . It also show CCL5 ( RANTES ) express plasma human JE , high plasma level associate fatal disease . Clinical data flavivirus encephalitides support concept inflammation may contribute pathogenesis . For example , immunosuppressed transplant patient infected West Nile virus develop CNS disease later immunocompetent patient . Cytokines act isolation , indeed pluripotency redundancy biological response one characteristic feature . Recent microarray experiment show wide range molecule upregulated CNS inflammatory condition . In addition Liverpool group study relationship antibody responses outcome . Along investigator , show presence antibody serum CSF associate survival . JE Nepal : Japanese encephalitis first record Nepal 1978 currently endemic 24 district . Since first appearance 26,667 case 5381 death . The early mortality figure quote 60 % , recently improve approximately 20 % 15 year . The morbidity think around 50 % . As result concern disease , immunization JE 1999 3 district , extend cover majority affected district . In addition Government vaccinate around 200 000 pig Terai zone 2001 . Despite success still ongoing case JE . In 2006 292 confirm case 1481 AES case unknown etiology . These figure may represent actual number case due logistical issue , death hospital admission , difficulty confirm diagnosis JE pair serum CSF sample . Recent serosurveillance animal host JE Nepal clearly show virus still present wild likely remain . Seroprevalence 48 % ( 102/212 ) , pig , 27 % ( 15/56 ) duck 50 % ( 6/12 ) horse total 280 serum collect 10 district 44 % positive overall . Hence , JE still major public health problem Nepal , press need develop good treatment . Currently IVIG use Nepal treat range pediatric condition , include Guillain-Barré syndrome , idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura . Rationale use IVIG JE : There currently antiviral immunomodulatory treatment JE indeed flavivirus encephalitis . As outlined , trial conduct , use interferon alpha , use dexamethasone , fail show benefit . Based data preclinical study , observational study human ( see ) , IVIG currently offer best hope treatment , antiviral anti-inflammatory property . Established pediatric us IVIG : IVIG establish standard treatment number childhood immune mediate disease include Guillain-Barré syndrome , Kawasaki 's disease , immune thrombocytopenia Dermatomyositis . In Kawasaki disease , T cell B cell activation regulate IVIG . In thrombocytopenic purpura blockade FCγ receptor think important , may result regulation secretory cytokine . In Guillain-Barré syndrome dermatomyositis inhibition complement bind prevention membranolytic attack complex formation possible mechanism IVIG action . In addition , IVIG employ treatment prophylaxis number childhood viral infection neutralize antibody IVIG think important . IVIG use treat , later provide prophylaxis , child hypo- agammaglobulinamia chronic enteroviral meningoencephalitis . Importantly , child X-linked agammaglobulinaemia enteroviral meningoencephalitis treat intensive prolonged IVIG therapy achieve long-lasting clinical viral remission ( negative CSF viral culture PCR ) . However , patient relapse IVIG taper , indicate major beneficial role IVIG condition . IVIG infusion infant child AIDS treat zidovudine therapy show reduce risk serious bacterial infection ( 16.9 % IVIG group vs 24.3 % placebo group ( relative risk , 0.60 ; 95 percent confidence interval , 0.35 1.04 ; p = 0.07 ) . In respiratory syncytial virus ( RSV ) infection immunoglobulin therapy show safe generally well tolerate randomize control trial ( RCT ) involve 102 previously healthy child , though beneficial effect reduce hospitalization intensive care unit day marginal child severe disease . Other establish indication passive immunization IVIG include parvovirus B19 infection . Use IVIG flavivirus encephalitis : There strong evidence suggest JEV , like neurotropic flavivirus , may susceptible antibody-mediated , rather cell-mediated immune response . For JEV , neurotropic flavivirus , clearance virus dependent cytolytic T cell activity , contrast non-neurotropic virus . Neurons , terminally differentiated cell , express MHC-1 , would subject lysis CD8 T cell non-replacement . Animal data support importance antibody mediate immunity . In one study , Konishi et . al . immunized mouse plasmid DNAs encode JEV protein induce neutralize antibody response cytotoxic T lymphocyte response , challenge lethal intraperitoneal dos virus . They show neutralize antibody prevents virus dissemination peripheral site brain , antibody-mediated mechanism protection efficient cytotoxic T cell response . These finding support early work show anti-envelope protein antibody , critical protective component JEV challenge model , recent passive antibody transfer experiment . In vitro work mouse show protective role IVIG give prophylactically prevent flavivirus cause tick borne encephalitis protective effect use treatment . In work several different group , use IVIG contain specific anti West Nile Virus antibody viraemic phase , virus enter CNS , show dramatic 100 % survival . Similar work Tick borne encephalitis 100 % effect survival . There good data animal model flavivirus encephalitis , peripheral administration antibody neutralize virus even enter central nervous system . Clinical Data : Because preclinical data support role antibody treatment flavivirus encephalitis , antibody treatment ( form IVIG ) also use compassionate basis JE , West Nile encephalitis . In addition IVIG currently investigate West Nile encephalitis National Institutes Health ( NIH ) sponsor randomize placebo control trial United States ( Prof Solomon Scientific Steering Committee ) . IVIG use 49 year old traveler return Vietnam present JE Italian hospital . IVIG also use treat West Nile virus infection five patient Israel three United States . IVIG also assess placebo control trial West Nile virus infection United States serious adverse effect drug . Rationale Dose : The commonly use dose IVIG 2g/kg , either give single infusion , divide 400mg/kg five day . In Kawasaki disease 2g/kg single ten hour infusion well tolerate , show effective regime . In Guillain-Barré syndrome child adult drug often give 5 day , regime use patient flavivirus encephalitis , use study . Drug Intervention : Children meet entry criterion randomly assign receive IVIG , ( Reliance Biophamaceuticals Pvt . Ltd. ) dose 400mg/kg/day 5 day , equivalent volume 0.9 % normal saline , use establish technique give fluid treatment double blind manner . Drug Presentation : We use Immunorel™ intravenous immunoglobulin , produce Reliance Biophamaceuticals Pvt . Ltd. , manufacture China available Yetichem Pharmacy , Sundhara , Kathmandu Shriran Pharmacy , Maharajgunj , Kathmandu . This IVIG product currently use often Nepal . As part Asia , seroprevalence JE China high . By age 10 , approximately one third child neutralize antibody JEV , adulthood , majority population expose . There extensive data show IVIG area flaviviruses endemic contains significant amount neutralize antibody . For example IVIG Israel contain moderate high level neutralize antibody West Nile Virus . Even though West Nile virus circulate United States year , high level neutralize antibody find IVIG lot . Anti-JEV neutralize antibody IVIG Asia : We recently examine neutralize antibody titre range IVIG product India China , use plaque reduction neutralization assay ( PRNT ) 50 . In study find IVIG UK , contain antibody , serum laboratory worker vaccinate JEV contain small amount neutralize antibody . In contrast IVIG manufacture Bharrat , Hualan , Sichun Reliance company neutralize antibody titre great 1 400 , Reliance great titre , nearly 1 750 . Immunorel™ pack clear colorless vial come 2 pack size , contain IVIG dose 0.05g/ml ( ie 50mg/ml ) . The available vial , 50ml ( contain 2.5g ) , 100ml ( 5.0g ) . Children thus receive 400mg/kg/day IVIG equivalent 8mls/kg/day Immunorel™ solution , 8ml/kg/day 0.9 % normal saline . Pharmacokinetics : Distribution study do range IVIG preparation . In study patient develop aseptic meningitis ( complication infusion ) , receive 2 g/kg intravenously 2 divided dos , serum level increase fivefold decline 50 % next 72 hour extravascular redistribution take place . By 21- 28 day , pretreatment level reach . The half-life 18-32 day , similar native immunoglobulin . In first 48 hour infusion CSF concentration increase 1.5 7-fold return normal within week . CNS penetration may expect patient viral meningoencephalitis even encephalomyelitis break blood-brain-barrier . Metabolism IVIG take place cell reticuloendothelial system immunoglobulins immunoglobulin complex break . Studies Immunorel® normal subject show peak serum concentration occur immediately intravenous injection , dose relate . Within 24 hour 30 % dose may remove catabolism distribution . Data concern distribution suggest IVIg distribute throughout intravascular ( 60 % ) extravascular ( 40 % ) space . The serum half life immunoglobulin range 21 29 day . Reaction Associated Intravenous Immunoglobulin : Reactions intravenous immunoglobulin tend relate infusion rate likely occur first hour infusion . We monitor patient 's vital sign general status regularly throughout infusion . The type reaction report include abdominal pain , headache , chest-tightness , facial flushing pallor , hot sensation , dyspnoea , non-urticarial skin rash , itching , hypotension , nausea vomit . Should reactions develop infusion IVIG , infusion temporarily stop patient improves clinically ( 5 10 minute ) cautiously recommence slow rate . Some patient may develop delayed adverse reaction IVIG nausea , vomit , chest pain , rigor , dizziness ache leg . These adverse reaction occur infusion stop usually within 24 hour . True hypersensitivity reaction IVIG urticaria , angioedema , bronchospasm hypotension occur rarely . Should anaphylactic reaction develop IVIG , infusion stop treatment instituted adrenaline , oxygen , antihistamine steroid . Hemolytic anemia neutropenia report rare instance association IVIG treatment . Mild moderate elevation serum transaminase ( AST , ALT , gamma GT ) observe small number patient give IVIG . Such change transient associate transmission hepatitis . Rare complication aseptic meningitis syndrome ( AMS ) , thrombophlebitis , renal dysfunction acute renal failure occur patient receive IVIG . Liver renal function monitor study . Reactions Associated Immunorel™ : . Primary Immune Deficiency : In patient immunodeficiency syndrome receive IVIG monthly dose 400 mg/kg body weight , reaction report malaise , feel faintness , fever , chill , headache , nausea , vomit , chest tightness , dyspnoea chest , back hip pain .
