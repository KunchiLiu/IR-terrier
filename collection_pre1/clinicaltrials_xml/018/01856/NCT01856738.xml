	<brief_summary>Rationale : Visual hallucination ( VH ) common non-motor symptom Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . As independent predictor cognitive decline nursing home placement form important disability milestone course PD . According current clinical guideline minor VH require treatment per se . But minor VH precede stage major VH without insight PD associate psychosis ( PDP ) offer opportunity early intervention . Neuroleptic drug delay transition PDP unsuitable early treatment VH due side effect . We hypothesize cholinesterase inhibitor ( ChEI ) well-tolerated alternative early treatment minor VH delay progression PDP , brain network analysis suitable predict treatment response . Objective : Investigate whether early treatment ChEI delay progression minor VH major VH without insight PDP . In addition , measure motor control , psychotic symptom , cognitive impairment , mood disorder , daytime sleepiness , adverse event compliance , disability , caregiver burden care use . We assess cost-effectiveness early chronic treatment VH ChEI . Finally , analyse change functional brain network treatment . Study design : A randomized , double blind , placebo-controlled , multi-center trial economic evaluation . Study population : 168 patient PD VH fulfil in-and exclusion criterion . Intervention : Rivastigmine capsule 6 mg BID placebo BID 24 month . Main study parameters/endpoints : The primary outcome measure median time PD patient minor VH progress major VH without insight . The clinical endpoint define start antipsychotic treatment . Secondary outcome measure change motor control , psychotic symptom , cognitive impairment , mood disorder , daytime sleepiness , cholinergic deficiency , number adverse event , compliance , disability caregiver burden . The median time PD patient minor VH progress PD dementia measure mean change cognitive function . The secondary neurophysiological outcome measure peak frequency , functional connectivity , topological network organisation direction information flow . All relevant cost measure value . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : The burden participation consist total 5 clinical visit ( every 6 month ) , 5 telephone interview adverse event escalation phase 9 questionnaire health relate cost ( every 3 month ) . In subgroup 3 additional visit EEG record need . There risk adverse reaction rivastigmine treatment ; common nausea vomiting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study perform four regional study center : i.e . VUmc-AMC Amsterdam , Atrium MC Heerlen , UMC Groningen en Radboudumc Nijmegen . Each regional study center participate neurologist station research nurse â€” part-time . VUmc-AMC also national coordinate center research nurse also national trial manager . Because logistics complex assessment cumbersome , vital research nurse perform facilitate inclusion assure proper follow-up assessment . All research nurse train examined performing aspect Visits , i.e . explain study use questionnaire . Every twelve month , research nurse follow additional training keep expertise date minimize intra-rater inter-rater variability . In addition four study center , approximately 30 hospital request participate local recruitment center . Eligible patient recruit treat neurologist recruitment center regular follow-up appointment outpatient clinic . In addition , treat neurologist send recruitment letter select group potentially eligible patient base data patient file clinical database . The recruitment letter give short introduction topic visual hallucination underline importance participate study . Patients interested encourage contact research nurse information make appointment . The treat neurologist check inclusion -exclusion criterion . He ask patient permission send contact information research nurse . If patient eligible agrees , neurologist complete patient registration form name , gender , date birth , telephone number in- exclusion criterion . After registration , research nurse contact patient phone within 10 working day . She introduce study patient , inform patient gross outline trial discus possible benefit disadvantage . She answer additional question study . If patient agrees appointment make ( visit 1 ) . All study visit take place home outpatient clinic regional study center . The study medication prescribe participate neurologist one four regional study center . During Visit 1 Informed Consent obtain . The baseline characteristic record , well medication history , year type first PD symptom ( e.g . tremor , bradykinesia ) year PD diagnosis . Current medication note Levodopa Equivalent Daily Dose ( LEDD ) calculate . Visual acuity test digital version Snellen chart ( iPad ) . During Visit 1 patient undergo several assessment research nurse . During Visit 1 visit ( 2,3,4 5 ) two 6 mL EDTA blood sample DNA analysis drawn store future genetic research ; include possible genetic modifier response medication . At end visit research nurse randomize patient central web-based computer program . Medication send mail central pharmacy complete study period . The treatment start soon possible randomization least within 6 week baseline assessment . The research nurse inquire patient medication receive , medication intake side effect telephone 2,3,5,8 11 week treatment . The interview take accord schedule close possible . Only miss interview dose escalation step consider protocol violation . Four specified assessment visit take place Visit 1 : 6 month , 12 month , 18 month 24 month ( respectively Visits 2 , 3 , 4 5 ; see table 1 ) . The visit complete accord schedule close possible , least within 6 week plan date . The long term outcome measure unlikely change significantly within period time . The assessment Visit 1 repeat research nurse complete monitor side effect , change ( non-parkinsonian ) medication calculation LEDD . Patients ask bring remain number capsule . These counted measure compliance . Patients agree participate additional CHEVAL-in study visit outpatient clinic VU University Medical Center perform EEG within approximately 4-6 week baseline assessment start study medication . The EEG recording repeat 6 possible 12 month . The recording complete accord schedule close possible , least within 6 week plan date . If criterion PD psychosis ( primary outcome ) PD dementia ( secondary outcome ) meet , study medication assessment scheme alter . The treat neurologist report event local research coordinator one four main study center , use trial mutation form . This form include date primary outcome measure ; UPDRS-1 MDS score ( 3 4 hallucination item , indicate insight lose ) reason withdrawal study medication ( PD psychosis PD dementia ) . If condition PD psychosis reach ( primary endpoint ) , experimental treatment rivastigmine placebo discontinue . Because medical emergency , research nurse plan next clinical visit soon possible , subject 's condition allow participation later 6 week end treatment . During clinical visit ( visit ' 9 ' ) research nurse follow protocol regular visit . Planned visit cancel primary endpoint reach experimental treatment discontinue possible , patient visit 24 month . Costs continue measure every 3 month 24 month start treatment . If condition PD dementia reach ( secondary endpoint ) , treatment rivastigmine advise accord current PD treatment guideline . The patient instruct stop taking blind study medication start rivastigmine prescribe treat neurologist . Using trial mutation form , treat neurologist motivate decision switch open label rivastigmine . For safety , new dose escalation phase necessary . The consequence important event discuss participate neurologist regional study center necessary project coordinator project leader national coordinating center decide patient need withdraw study whether final clinical visit must complete . Both treat neurologist recruitment center participate neurologist participate center inform decision . Withdrawal individual subject : Subjects leave study time reason wish without consequence . Specific criterion withdrawal predefined . The investigator decide withdraw subject study treat neurologist point urgent medical reason , make necessary withdraw patient study . Subjects also withdraw case protocol violation . The datasets withdraw patient keep study database facilitate analysis accord intention-to-treat principle . Replacement individual subject withdrawal : Subjects replace . Drop account power calculation . Moreover analysis do accord intention-to-treat principle . Follow-up subject withdraw treatment : If patient violate study medication protocol register . All study procedures measurement conduct accord study protocol . Randomization , blind treatment allocation : After inclusion , patient randomize web base database . The server website operate VU University Medical Center . Eligible patient randomize computer 1:1 ratio rivastigmine group placebo group double-blind design . Until computerized randomization fully operational , patient randomize research nurse , absence , T.J.M . van Mierlo E.M.J . Foncke . Randomization stratify type hospital ( University Medical Center versus Non-University Medical Center ) , age ( 65 year 65 year old ) , disease duration ( &lt; 10 year , &gt; 10 year ) use variable permuted block . Code-breaking sheet emergency use keep safe . Study personnel , research nurse , neurologist , patient blind treatment allocation time . All data enter central database treatment cod break . The randomization code broken case emergency .</detailed_description>
