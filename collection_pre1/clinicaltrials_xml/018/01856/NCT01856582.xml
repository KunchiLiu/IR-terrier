	<brief_title>CD34+ Stem Cell Infusion Augment Graft Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate usefulness infuse purified CD34+ cell donor origin order augment graft function response decline chimerism initially perform allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) child primary immunodeficiency disease . This protocol utilized patient wan mixed donor chimerism inadequate correction clinical condition disease stem cell transplant perform , augmentation immune function . An infusion select CD34+ stem cell give without preparative regimen . As child eligible protocol reduce immune function pre-existing donor chimerism , hypothesize stem cell able engraft infusion augment graft function . This therapy serve alternative second stem cell transplant know associated significant morbidity mortality . CD34+ stem cell collect donor use initial stem cell transplant . Cells T-cell deplete ( TCD ) perform CD34 selection use CliniMACS device ( Miltenyi Biotec ) order prevent development new exacerbation exist graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) , avoidance GVHD nonmalignant diseases desirable . There sufficient data show mixed donor chimerism adequate reverting disease phenotype certain primary immunodeficiency . Observations Europe CCHMC show donor chimerism might boost CD34+ stem cell infusion alone without specific preparative regimen . This therapy likely associate low toxicity due absence preparative regimen lack exposure fresh donor cell capable initiate GVHD , offer potential significant benefit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To eligible protocol , patient must follow : 1 . Primary immunodeficiency ( e.g . SCID , WiskottAldrich and/or rare condition bone marrow failure syndrome ) prior allogeneic stem cell transplant . 2 . Waning donor chimerism immune function inadequate correct disease clinical condition , primary transplant give , determine attend physician . 3 . Available primary donor . 4 . Must organ dysfunction deem attend physician preclude procedure . 5 . Age &lt; 35 year time transplant 6 . One follow must true : Patients must evidence persistent recurrent immunodeficiency thrombocytopenia . OR • Primary immunodeficiency disease know potential progress malignant condition untreated . OR • Debilitating secondary disease know consequence inadequate immune response know agent pathogen , uncontrollable available medical therapy ( e.g . third patient describe page 5 ) . 1 . Absence available original donor 2 . Failure sign consent form , inability undergo inform consent process 3 . Pregnant lactate female 4 . Uncontrolled GVHD</criteria>
