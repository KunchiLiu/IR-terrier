	<brief_summary>`` Closed loop artificial pancreas '' system development control blood sugar live diabetes . These system consist continuous glucose sensor , send signal computer program automatically determine much insulin give . The computer program tell insulin pump deliver insulin . While system test number condition , post-meal blood sugar difficult control . This study design see liraglutide , glucagon like peptide receptor agonist , help minimize post meal blood sugar spike subject type 1 diabetes close loop system .</brief_summary>
