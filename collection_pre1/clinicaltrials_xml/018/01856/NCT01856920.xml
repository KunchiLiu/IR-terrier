	<brief_summary>Background : - GI-6207 experimental cancer vaccine make baker 's yeast . The yeast modify help immune system target protein call CEA . CEA find surface kind tumor cell , include thyroid cancer cell . Researchers want see GI-6207 encourage body 's immune system attack kill tumor cell contain CEA protein . They test see whether vaccine safe effective treatment medullary thyroid cancer respond early treatment . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness GI-6207 vaccine advance medullary thyroid cancer . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age medullary thyroid cancer respond early treatment . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They provide blood tumor sample image study neck chest . They also skin test make sure allergic yeast vaccine . - Participants divide two group . One group start take GI-6207 immediately 1 year . The second group 6 month monitor test vaccine , take GI-6207 1 year . - GI-6207 give every week first seven visit ( 3 month ) , monthly remain year treatment . It give injection beneath arm upper thigh . These location help vaccine enter lymph node reach immune system quickly . - Participants monitor frequent blood urine test image study . - Participants regular follow-up visit year study vaccine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : - CEA overexpressed multiple malignancy , include medullary thyroid cancer CEA universally express tumor cell . - There standard treatment patient asymptomatic minimally symptomatic , metastatic medullary thyroid cancer . The effective FDA-approved therapy ( vandetanib ) come significant toxicity , use patient symptomatic rapidly progress disease . - Preclinical study show GI-6207 induce strong immune response CEA well therapeutic anti-tumor response . - A previous Phase I GI-6207 study demonstrate safety enhance immune response patient . - Preliminary data suggests tumor growth rate calculate medullary thyroid cancer patient within 3 month - Retrospective data prostate cancer study suggest vaccine alter tumor growth rate within 3-4 month OBJECTIVES : Primary : -To determine effect GI-6207 calcitonin growth rate kinetics 6 month therapy patient medullary thyroid cancer ELIGIBILITY : - Patients evidence metastatic medullary thyroid cancer include disease evaluable bone CT scan . - Patients minimal disease related-symptoms ( minimal symptom include affect activity daily live pain require regularly schedule narcotic . ) - ECOG 0-1 - No previous chemotherapy - No previous vandetanib - Should autoimmune disease ; evidence immunocompromised ; serious inter-current medical illness ; cardiac disease ; prior splenectomy . ( History previous thyroid autoimmune disease allow patient total thyroidectomy . ) - No brain metastasis , history seizure , encephalitis , multiple sclerosis - No pericardial-based mass great 1 cm thoracic lesion large 2 cm Design : - Randomized , phase 2 study determine effect GI-6207 calcitonin growth rate 6 month GI-6207 - Patients randomize either initial GI-6207 therapy 6 month surveillance follow GI-6207 therapy . - GI-6207 administer subcutaneously 4 site dose 10 yeast unit per site , biweekly 7 visit ( day 1 , 15 , 29 , 43 , 57 , 71 , 85 ) , monthly 1 year treatment . ( For patient randomized surveillance GI-6207 , get full year GI-6207 6 month surveillance period . ) - Once patient complete one year therapy GI-6207 , patient without radiographic progression option receive vaccine every 3 month additional 12 month . Patients remain vaccine continue scan every 3 month . - Immune monitoring via apheresis do prior enrollment 6 month appropriate consenting patient . Patients evaluable immunologic response ELISPOT Assay ( HLA 02 , 03 24 ) apheresis start GI-6207 therapy every 3 month GI-6207 treatment feasible .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Participants must meet follow criterion participation : Diagnosis : Patients must histologically confirm medullary thyroid cancer Laboratory Pathology pathology report history consistent medullary thyroid cancer . It uncommon secondary , minor pathologic focus another form thyroid cancer coincidentally find 1520 % patient medullary thyroid cancer . In case , eligibility base discretion investigator . Patients must evidence metastatic medullary thyroid cancer include disease evaluable bone , CT scan MRI . ( Patients surgical candidate potentially render disease free surgical resection eligible . ) Patients must elevate calcitonin level , great 8 pg/mL female 16 pg/mL male Patients minimal disease relatedsymptoms ( Minimal symptom include affect activity daily live pain require regularly schedule narcotic . ) No brain metastasis , history seizure , encephalitis , multiple sclerosis . Age great equal 18 year ECOG performance status 01 study entry ( Karnofsky great equal 70 ) No systemic steroid use within 2 week prior initiation experimental therapy . Limited dos systemic steroid prevent IV contrast , allergic reaction anaphylaxis ( patient know contrast allergy ) allow . Hematological eligibility parameter Granulocyte count great equal 1,500/mm^3 Platelet count great equal 100,000/mm^3 Hemoglobin great equal 9 g/dL Biochemical eligibility parameter ( within 16 day start therapy ) Baseline renal function : Serum creatinine less equal 1.5 x upper limit normal OR creatinine clearance 24h urine collection great equal 60 mL/min . Hepatic function : Bilirubin le equal 1.5 mg/dl , patient Gilbert 's syndrome , total bilirubin less equal 3.0 mg/dL AST ALT &lt; 2.5 time upper limit normal No active malignancy within past 3 year ( exception nonmelanoma skin cancer , prostate cancer patient stable biochemical recurrence/not systemic therapy carcinoma situ bladder ) . Willing travel NIH followup visit Able understand sign inform consent . Must agree use effective birth control ( condom ) abstinence period 6 month last vaccination therapy . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients follow eligible participation study : Patients evidence immune dysfunction list . 1 Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positivity due potential decrease immune response vaccine . Active autoimmune disease require treatment recent history autoimmune disease require therapy , include , limited , inflammatory bowel disease , Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis , active diverticulitis . This requirement due potential risk exacerbate autoimmunity . However , patient vitiligo may enrol . ( Patients history autoimmune thyroid condition allow patient replacement medication . ) Concurrent use systemic steroid , except physiologic dos systemic steroid replacement local ( topical , nasal , eye drop inhale ) steroid use . Limited dos systemic steroid ( e.g. , patient exacerbation reactive airway disease prevent IV contrast allergic reaction anaphylaxis patient know contrast allergy ) allow . Pregnant breastfeed woman , due unknown effect GI6207 fetus infant . Serious intercurrent medical illness would interfere ability patient carry treatment program . Untreated brain metastasis ( local treatment brain metastasis within last 6 month ) due poor prognosis patient difficulty ascertain cause neurologic toxicity . Patients pericardial mass &gt; 1 cm thoracic lesion large 2 cm exclude . Concurrent chemotherapy . Chronic hepatitis infection , include B C , potential immune impairment cause disorder may diminish effectiveness immunologic therapy . Participation another interventional clinical trial time enrollment . Any significant disease , opinion investigator , may impair patient 's tolerance study treatment . Significant dementia , alter mental status , psychiatric condition would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent . Patients second malignancy within 3 year enrollment ; patient treat surgically curative intent , nonmelanoma skin cancer , localize kidney cancer carcinoma situ bladder , exclude . Patients MEN2 history pheochromocytoma also exclude . In addition patient prostate cancer require systemic therapy exclude . ( A secondary , minor pathologic focus another form thyroid cancer may coincidentally find 1520 % patient medullary thyroid cancer . In case , eligibility base discretion investigator .</criteria>
