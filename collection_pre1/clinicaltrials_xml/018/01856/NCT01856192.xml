	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well rituximab combination chemotherapy without lenalidomide work treat patient newly diagnose stage II-IV diffuse large B cell lymphoma . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , may interfere ability cancer cell grow spread . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin hydrochloride , vincristine sulfate , prednisone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Lenalidomide may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . It yet know whether rituximab combination chemotherapy effective give without lenalidomide treat patient diffuse large B cell lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab Combination Chemotherapy With Without Lenalidomide Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage II-IV Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Progression-free survival ( PFS ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Response rate ( RR ) . II . Complete remission ( CR ) rate define positron emission tomography ( PET ) -computed tomography ( CT ) criterion . III . Overall survival ( OS ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Impact diffuse large B cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) molecular subtype outcome . II . Interim PET scan result relation treatment outcome . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive rituximab intravenously ( IV ) , cyclophosphamide IV , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV , vincristine sulfate IV day 1 ; prednisone orally ( PO ) day 1-5 ; lenalidomide PO day 1-10 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients receive rituximab , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin hydrochloride , vincristine sulfate , prednisone Arm A . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 1 year , annually 7 year .</detailed_description>
