	<brief_summary>An open non-randomized study use biology drive selection therapy . WINTHER study explore match tumoral normal tissue biopsy use novel method predict efficacy drug . The aim provide rational personalize therapeutic choice ( 100 % ) patient enrol study , harbor oncogenic event ( mutations/ translocations/ amplification , etc . ) . The total number patient treat study two hundred across participate cancer center ( European country -France ; Spain- , Israel , USA Canada ) . All center realize study independently .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Informed consent Any histologic type metastatic cancer , ( except lung brain US sit ) , histologic normal counterpart obtain . Progression RECIST ( Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ) criteria least one prior regimen advance disease . Ability undergo biopsy surgical procedure obtain fresh tumor biopsy pair normal counterpart . Age 18 year Life expectancy least 3 month ECOG Performance status 0 1 Measurable evaluable disease accord RECIST 1.1 criterion For U.S. site , advance cancer patient exhaust effective therapy disease progress previous line therapy ( documented disease progression last treatment receive ) conventional method assign new therapy would expect increase survival 3 month . Any patient might require lung brain biopsy exclude ( US sit ) Alteration organ function hematopoietic function define follow criterion : 1 . Serum aspartate transaminase ( AST ) serum alanine transaminase ( ALT ) &gt; 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , except patient liver metastasis , AST ALT &gt; 5.0 ULN exclusion criterion . 2 . Bilirubin &gt; 2.0 ULN 3 . Polynuclear neutrophil &lt; 1.5 x 109/L 4 . Platelets &lt; 100 x 10 9/L 5 . Hemoglobin &lt; 90 g/L 6 . Creatinine &gt; 1.5 ULN 7 . Calcemia &gt; 1.5 ULN 8 . Phosphatemia &gt; 1.5 ULN Coagulation abnormality prohibit biopsy Symptomatic progressive brain metastasis detect radio imaging , meningeal Patient receive personalized therapeutic treatment base molecular anomaly treatment period prior WINTHER direct treatment ( define PFS1 ) . Hormonal therapy may continue WINTHER suggest therapy . The exclusion prior match target therapy include limited targeted therapeutic EMA approve genomically match patient . If question whether prior therapy match targeted treatment agree discussion PIs also Clinical Management Committee member ; resolution take place prior start WINTHER direct treatment .</criteria>
