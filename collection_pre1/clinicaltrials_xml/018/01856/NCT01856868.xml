	<brief_title>Use ( - ) -Epicatechin Treatment Becker Muscular Dystrophy ( Pilot Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This proof-of-concept phase 1/2a pilot endpoint development study design provide initial evidence biological activity ( - ) -epicatechin . Primary endpoint include initial assessment tissue-specific evidence efficacy muscle biopsy sample . Secondary endpoint include measure strength physical function , safety adverse event data . Pilot endpoint include assessment mRNA miRNA peripheral blood profile validation non-invasive near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) muscle perfusion study exercise recumbent cycle exercise test may employ endpoint future clinical trial . This single center open-label pilot study enroll 10 adult genetically-confirmed Becker muscular dystrophy , receive purify nutritional extract ( - ) -epicatechin 100mg/day orally 8 week . After screen visit , participant enrol study meet inclusion criterion . They evaluate baseline screening , day 1 , week 1 , 2 , 4 8 .</detailed_description>
