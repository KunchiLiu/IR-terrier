	<brief_summary>The over-arching goal propose project understand impact medication adherence upon engagement behavioral treatment alcohol use disorder . The propose project pilot feasibility study inpatient veteran problem alcohol use William S. Middleton VA Hospital ( Madison , WI ) . Participants randomize one two parallel study condition : ( 1 ) initial 50 mg oral dose naltrexone prior hospital discharge plus 30-day prescription oral naltrexone , ( 2 ) single 380 mg intramuscular injection naltrexone administer prior discharge second injection one month later . The central hypothesis hospital-administered injectable naltrexone , compare daily oral naltrexone take home , reduce alcohol use day immediately follow hospitalization . Injectable naltrexone efficacious vs. placebo addition behavioral treatment several study .

	<detailed_description>The propose project pilot feasibility study inpatient veteran problem alcohol use William S. Middleton VA Hospital . The over-arching goal understand impact medication adherence upon engagement behavioral treatment alcohol use disorder . Participants randomize one two parallel study condition : ( 1 ) initial 50 mg oral dose naltrexone prior hospital discharge plus 30-day prescription oral naltrexone , ( 2 ) single 380 mg intramuscular injection naltrexone ( duration action = 30 day ) administer prior discharge follow second injection one month later . The central hypothesis hospital-administered , long-acting injectable naltrexone , compare daily oral naltrexone , reduce alcohol use day immediately follow hospitalization . This reduced consumption , hypothesize , follow improved engagement substance abuse treatment . Primary Aim : Demonstrate feasibility propose recruitment method study design . This aim comprise two measure correspond goal : ( 1 ) Recruitment/enrollment—with recruitment goal 50 eligible consent subject 8 month time period , ( 2 ) Follow-up data collection goal post-hospitalization follow-up data less 70 % enrolled subject . Secondary Aims : As pilot feasibility study , may anticipate sufficient power attain statistical significance patient-oriented outcome measure . However , important u consider evaluate pertinent outcomes potential moderator order ( 1 ) develop fine-tune study design , ( 2 ) determine effect size primary outcome may calculate appropriate sample size future large study . As , secondary aim current study : 1 . To compare injectable naltrexone study oral naltrexone term attendance recommend outpatient substance abuse treatment . We hypothesize injectable naltrexone associate improved likelihood attend initial visit substance abuse treatment . 2 . To compare treatment attendance adherent vs. non-adherent patient oral naltrexone condition . Adherence define take ≥ 80 % daily naltrexone dos determine via pill count . We hypothesize , control addiction severity , mental illness measure , motivation change , adherence daily oral naltrexone predict treatment engagement follow hospital discharge . 3 . To compare study arm term ongoing alcohol consumption . We hypothesize ( 1 ) improve medication adherence oral naltrexone arm ( 2 ) assignment injectable naltrexone associate reduce alcohol consumption ( number heavy drinking day past 14 day ) follow hospital discharge . Exploratory Aims involve examination relationship study outcome ( 1 ) disorder prevalent veteran population ( post-traumatic stress disorder , anxiety , depression , traumatic brain injury ) ( 2 ) stigma relate alcohol dependence . If patient recruit VA Substance Abuse Residential Rehabilitation Treatment Program ( SARRTP ) examination outcomes associated factor hospital inpatient vs. residential treatment participant comprise exploratory aim .</detailed_description>
