	<brief_summary>Omega 3 form phospholipid main component nerve cell oral intake know positive impact behavior disorder depression bipolar disorder . Their consumption would improve brain function increase ability concentrate . The study aim determine effect increase Omega 3 form phospholipid process visual information brain particular attention perceptual-cognitive learning three dimension environment . Eighty subject ( 40 young ( 18-35 year ) 40 old ( 60-75 year ) ) divide four group , two Omega-3 ( 20 young 20 old ) two placebo ( 20 young 20 elderly ) , study , perform complex perceptual-cognitive task pursuit move object 3D space . This stimulus choose similar situation daily life , also involve mechanism perceptual-cognitive level . The main objective demonstrate positive effect Omega-3 phospholipid perceptual-cognitive training .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Improve visual skill train perceptual-cognitive learning could method aim repair partial neurophysiological deficit produce new brain network . Studies suggest mechanism attention cortical plasticity role play information retrieval . In addition , show Omega 3 form phospholipid main component nerve cell take orally make positive impact behavior disorder depression bipolar disorder . Their consumption would also help improve brain function increase ability concentrate . The perceptual-cognitive ability high level treatment complex visual information . However , ability brain seem driven fact brain great plasticity . This mean neuronal reorganization learn new capacity . 3D-MOT , 3-Dimensional Multiple Object Tracking technique allow study visual system track move target 3D . It task multifocal attentional pursuit assess ability keep position different move target similar object . Performance measure base number object successfully follow . Previous study also show young patient typically take four object simultaneously . In addition , track capability , speed use dependent variable seem drivable . Therefore , Faubert Sidebottom show young people could significantly increase speed threshold . Legault Faubert ( 2012 ) demonstrate train method 3D-MOT generates significant improvement visual-cognitive ability perception movement human body , crucial index avoid collision navigate dense crowd example . The purpose project evaluate impact take Omega-3 phospholipid form perceptual-cognitive ability , learn rate ( curve ) young old adult . The sample compose 40 young people ( 20 35 ) 40 old adult ( 60-75 ) divide two group . The stimulus task multiple object 3D-MOT consist simultaneously track multiple move object among distractors , present 3D television screen . The performance observer ( speed threshold ) evaluate base three element follow without error .</detailed_description>
