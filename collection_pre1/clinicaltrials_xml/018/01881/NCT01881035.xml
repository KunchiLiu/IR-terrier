	<brief_title>Treatment Resistant Hypertension Renal Sympathetic Denervation Patients Undergoing Dialysis Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Drug resistant hypertension common end stage renal disease treat dialysis . The prevalence hypertension evaluate 50 % 80 % . In patient group mortality figure high cardiovascular disease complication hypertension . Renal nerve denervation new intervention treat hypertension . By apply radiofrequency pulse renal artery , nerve vascular wall ( adventitia layer ) denervated . This cause reduction renal sympathetic afferent efferent activity blood pressure decrease . The technique efficacy end stage renal disease systematically study . There case report show promising response denervation . In present study 30 patient 18 year plan undergo renal denervation medical treatment ( three different drug include diuretic ) fail decrease blood pressure sufficiently ( 160/100mmHg ) . The failure medical treatment document ambulatory blood pressure measurement . After renal nerve denervation two year follow-up patient ambulatory blood pressure measurement organize . The blood pressure denervation compare quality life patient evaluate questionnaire .</detailed_description>
