	<brief_summary>The investigator undertake prospective , randomized trial compare recovery profile throughout first postoperative week patient receive continuous ( CISB ) interscalene brachial plexus block , single injection ( SISB ) , general anesthesia ( GA ) arthroscopic rotator cuff repair surgery . Specifically , effect three anesthetic technique use intraoperatively sole anesthesia modality study postoperative pain , time-to-first pain , analgesic consumption , fast-tracked PACU bypass rate , length PACU stay , time-to-discharge home , sleep duration , related adverse effect . The investigator hypothesize CISB result superior postoperative recovery profile compare SISB GA alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Continuous Interscalene Block Results Superior Recovery Throughout First Postoperative Week</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background The advantage single injection ( SISB ) continuous interscalene brachial plexus block ( CISB ) general anesthesia ( GA ) previously report . However , study extend observation beyond 48 postoperative hour , study compare effect SISB CISB sole anesthesia modality GA . We undertake randomize trial compare recovery profile patient receive SISB , CISB GA arthroscopic rotator cuff repair surgery first postoperative week . Our primary hypothesis high NRS pain rating ( bad pain score ) end study week low patient CISB group patient SISB GA group . Methods After Institutional Review Board approval inform consent obtain , 71 patient American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) physical status I-III , ≥18 year age , BMI≤35 kg/m2 , schedule elective outpatient arthroscopic rotator cuff repair , enrol . CISB patient receive 20 mL 0.5 % ropivacaine bolus catheter whereas SISB patient receive volume injection needle . CISB patient receive infusion 0.2 % ropivacaine 5mL/h patient control bolus 5 mL hourly . GA patient receive standardized general anesthetic . All patient prescribe acetaminophen ( 500mg ) hydrocodone ( 7.5mg ) every 4h need . CISB discontinue 48 h surgery . Postoperative high pain score ( NRS ) first postoperative week , time-to-first pain , analgesic consumption , fast-tracked postoperative care unit ( PACU ) bypass rate , length PACU stay , time-to-discharge home , sleep duration , related adverse effect record PACU home postoperative day 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 .</detailed_description>
