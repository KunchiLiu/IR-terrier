	<brief_summary>To test function safety Medtronic Overnight Closed Loop ( OCL ) System closely monitor 12 hour overnight inpatient study . Once safety device validate move study outpatient diabetes camp setting . The camp set allow u obtain pilot efficacy safety data `` real-life '' environment . We plan compare subject control night subject night OCL system assess percent sensor glucose reading target range 70-150 mg/dl . Based previous research , anticipate use OCL system contribute great percentage sensor glucose reading target range .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The step inpatient camp study , except inpatient study subject IV insert blood sample obtain every 1/2 hour overnight . They also 20-30 minute activity afternoon evening . After 16 subject enter inpatient study , data send DSMB ( Data Safety Monitoring Board ) review . If study show study meet predefined safety criterion , DSMB approve , conduct outpatient study . Step 1 : Subjects eligible study ( camp inpatient hospital ) contact phone email , study explain , write consent obtain , enrol study . They mail Bayer Next meter , control solution , glucose test strip . Step 2 : The perform quality control test meter use control solution , email result study coordinator . For week prior research center admission camp ask use Bayer meter obtain two fast glucose level 20 minute apart . They call study coordinator 3-5 day prior admission review blood glucose test requirement family . Subjects least 3 day data eligible study participation . Step 3 : On arrival hospital , camp bus stop subject bring original informed consent sign parent and/or guardian le 18 year old . This generally occur 10 AM noon camp , arrive lunch research center . Step 4 : The lunch , within first 3 hour lunch ( within 3 hour arrival camp research center ) history , limited physical exam A1c level pregnancy test female . They assign unique 5 digit identifier : The first digit camp session ; next two digit cabin number ; last two digit subject ID ( identification ) . Subject 30804 would camp session 3 , assign cabin 8 , subject 4 . All subject enrol assign subject ID progressively increase across camp session , i.e . summer one subject # 4 . Step 5 : Their Medtronic pump ( home ) Bayer meter upload . Two Enlite sensor use inpatient study . Only one Enlite sensor use camp phase study . All sensor insert 3pm subject give study pump , pump setting transfer study Revel 2.0 Medtronic Insulin Pump . They receive train study pump Enlite sensor . The CGM training do group session consist standard teaching develop JDRF ( Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation ) randomize clinical trial . Insulin dose give camp medical staff ( include correction dos ) , use predictive alarm . Alarm thresholds set 70 250 mg/dl day control night . When CLP active night , local alarm Revel 2.0 pump turn . There rate change alarm . There active insulin time set 6 hour . This probably different usual setting , explain set safety purpose study . The bolus wizard feature pump turn used insulin dos . They may use type meal bolus would routinely use meal home ( standard and/or dual wave square wave bolus ) . Step 6 : Data pump meter download use initialize CLP . These initialization parameter enter Android phone assign ( remain study staff ) . Their name tap onto phone , study pump , home pump meter use labeler . The date time enter device time synchronize near minute . Step 7 : At camp randomize cabin , equal number camper assign active closed-loop control first night control arm first night . Thereafter assign alternate arm study every night . Step 8 : The Enlite sensor ( ) calibrate 2 hour insertion , dinner 9 PM rate change arrows time first day . Thereafter calibration value enter meal 9 PM snack rate change arrows . These finger stick do supervision counselor make sure hand either wash finger clean alcohol allow dry finger prick . Step 9 : At camp even activity dinner , range `` capture-the-flag '' , scavenger hunt , dance , campfire , activity . During inpatient hospital stay activity dinner 7-8 PM subject wear heart rate monitor goal achieve elevated heart rate varies 100 140 bpm 20 - 30 minute . This may accomplish use exercise treadmill bicycle , aerobic activity ( jump jack , stair climbing , brief sprint , etc. ) . The goal evening activity mimic variable activity occur camp , sedentary dinner . Step 11 : On arrival cabin even activity assign closed-loop control CLP system activate . In hospital begin 9 PM . 1 . The OCL system parameter Android controller set value list subject-specific OCL parameter document . These verify two study personnel cross-checking . 2 . A fingerstick glucose obtain enter CLP . The meter glucose must 70 350 mg/dl OCL activate . At time serum ketone test obtain Precision Xtra meter NovaStat meter serum ketone must â‰¤ 0.6 mmol/L proceed study . 3 . The Translator , Revel 2.0 Insulin Pump MiniLink must within 6 foot . The OCL controller ( Android platform ) subject/campers room/cabin direct contact controller . 4 . The OCL activate . The system may activate sensor meter glucose reading show great 20 % difference . In case threshold alarm pump activate 70 250 mg/dl OCL use . Step 12 : The CLP ( Closed Loop Platform , Android phone ) establish communication intranet camp remote monitoring confirm view data iPAD connect camp intranet . In hospital CLP establish communication hospital intranet service , remote monitoring confirm computer outside patient room iPAD . Step 14 : Patient management decision base meter glucose reading ( possible ketone reading study ) .</detailed_description>
