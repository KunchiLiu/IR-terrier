	<brief_title>Periodontal Treatment Response Type II Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many study show relationship chronic inflammatory periodontal disease diabetes , disease influence . Research study show control inflammation gum improve level metabolic control ( i.e . blood glucose level ) patient diabetes . However , still clear periodontal treatment approach would best maintain control inflammation diabetic patient . Triclosan anti-plaque anti-inflammatory property decrease gum inflammation . The purpose study 1 ) determine effect triclosan contain toothpaste gum inflammation type II diabetic patient periodontal disease , 2 ) evaluate whether type II diabetic patient show improvement periodontal status blood glucose follow periodontal treatment without use triclosan contain toothpaste . Patients type II diabetes meet study criterion randomly assign either triclosan contain toothpaste placebo toothpaste . Dental cleaning oral exam perform baseline , 6 week , 3 , 6 , 9 12 month , sample collect baseline , 3 , 6 12 month . Samples may collect include blood , plaque , gingival crevicular fluid , saliva plaque . Women may also ask complete pregnancy test . Photographs x-rays patient mouth/teeth may take , requirement . The sample collect used ass effect triclosan contain toothpaste glycemic control local systemic inflammatory mediator course periodontal treatment .</detailed_description>
