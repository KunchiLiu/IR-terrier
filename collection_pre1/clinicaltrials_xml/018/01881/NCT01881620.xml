	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : We would like demonstrate diagnosis performance PET/CT scan without contrast agent ( COMBI TEP ) , equivalent good PET/ non enhance CT scan ( PET scan ) associate enhanced CT scan . This research project pilot study give available data concern image exam reproducibility . This study allow u assess feasibility large-scale study , also evaluate COMBI TEP performance . From estimate , consider comparative study evaluate performance COMBI PET . This study prospective single center study .</detailed_description>
