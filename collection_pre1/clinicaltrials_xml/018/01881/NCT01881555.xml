	<brief_summary>The objective trial compare clinical outcome cost-effectiveness 2 therapeutic strategy , one base coronary angiography guidance base coronary angiography fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) multivessel coronary artery disease patient . The trial prospective , multicenter , French , randomized clinical trial include men woman ≥ 18 year present significant multivessel disease define coronary angiography coronary narrowing &gt; 50 % diameter stenosis least 2 major epicardic vessel . The patient give informed consent randomly assign therapeutic strategy base upon coronary angiography angiography FFR testing . In FFR group , significant coronary stenosis define FFR ≤ 0.8 . Based upon multivessel evaluation ( angiography FFR ) , investigator choose best therapeutic strategy discretion ( medical optimal treatment , coronary stenting , coronary artery bypass graft surgery ) . The aim revascularization procedure obtain complete revascularization . In FFR group , stenosis FFR≤0.8 treat . The primary end point trial composite major cardiovascular event include death cause , myocardial infarction , hospitalization coronary revascularization perform addition initial treatment stroke 1 year follow-up . Secondary end point include adverse event , individual major cardiovascular event , stent thrombosis , bleed event , occlusion coronary artery bypass graft , patient 's quality life cost-effectiveness 30-day , 6 month , 2-year 5-year outcome .</brief_summary>
