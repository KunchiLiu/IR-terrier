	<brief_title>Anti TNF α Improves Endothelial Dysfunction IBD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crohn 's Disease ( CD ) life long disease mainly affect young adult . There evidence That gut tissue injury result abnormal immune response involve multiple non immune cellular system include intestinal microvascular endothelial cell . Moreover , clinical study show 1-7 % irritable bowel disease ( IBD ) patient suffer arterial venous thromboembolic complication . Chronic inflammation major role development propagation endothelial dysfunction , lead coronary artery disease . Endothelial dysfunction describe patient various diverse chronic inflammatory condition . Over last year , dysfunction vascular endothelium widely recognize first step development atherosclerosis . Several inflammatory mediator , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , Tumor Necrosis Factor α , ( TNF α ) , nitric oxide ( NO ) , vascular endothelial growth factor , CD-40 , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , up-regulated IBD , also know impact vascular impact . The normal endothelium produce vasodilatatory response ischemia refer u reactive hyperemia . Shear stress blood vessel wall lead production release vasodilatation . With endothelial dysfunction often either blunt vasodilatatory response ischemic event , chronic inflammation . The hypothesis study patient Crohn 's disease increase incidence endothelial dysfunction , correct improved treatment anti TNF α . The purpose study assess endothelial function patient Crohn 's Disease , treatment ( steroid , immunomodulators , anti TNF α ) . This study assess presence endothelial dysfunction patient Crohn 's disease evaluate possible role tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) -α pathophysiology abnormality . In study preform endothelial function test treatment Endopath device Itamar medical , FDA approve . Safety- Each subject screen clinical history , physical examination , electrocardiogram , chest X-ray , Mantoux test ( PPD ) , routine chemical analysis , biomarkers . The study protocol approve local institutional review board .</detailed_description>
