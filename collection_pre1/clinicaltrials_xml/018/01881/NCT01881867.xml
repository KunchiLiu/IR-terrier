	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 ( CYT107 ) vaccine therapy work treat patient hormone-resistant prostate cancer spread area body respond least one type treatment . Biological therapy , glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 , may stimulate immune system different way stop tumor cell grow . Vaccines make white blood cell mixed tumor protein may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell . It yet know whether glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 work well without vaccine therapy treat prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CYT107 After Vaccine Treatment ( Provenge ) Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether CYT107 administration increase vaccine-induced antigen-specific T-cell immune response sipuleucel-T fusion protein vaccine construct prostatic acid phosphatase-sargramostim ( PAP-GM-CSF ) ( PA2024 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether CYT107 administration increase vaccine-induced antigen-specific T-cell immune response PAP . II . To assess character T-cell immune response PAP PA2024 . III . To determine whether CYT107 administration increase vaccine-induced antigen-specific antibody immune response PAP PA2024 . IV . To quantify effect CYT107 T-cell repertoire diversity . V. To assess effect CYT107 immune competence patient advanced prostate cancer . VI . To assess clinical efficacy tolerability sipuleucel-T plus CYT107 compare sipuleucel-T alone . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . COHORT I : Patients receive treatment ( observation ) completion standard sipuleucel-T therapy . COHORT II : Patients receive glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 subcutaneously ( SC ) every week 4 week ( day 0 , 7 , 14 , 21 ) begin 3-7 day completion standard sipuleucel-T therapy . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 53 week .</detailed_description>
