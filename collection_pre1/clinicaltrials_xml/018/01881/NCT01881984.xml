	<brief_summary>This medical research study test medication adult patient disease call medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase ( MCAD ) deficiency cause least one copy 985A &gt; G mutation . The medication glycerol phenylbutyrate , call Ravicti , currently FDA approve treatment urea cycle disorder . Previous research suggest Ravicti may also effective treatment MCAD deficiency . This study investigate safety efficacy ( well work ) Ravicti patient MCAD deficiency cause least one copy 985A &gt; G mutation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Ravictiâ„¢ Patients With MCAD Deficiency With 985A &gt; G ( K304E ) Mutation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participation study require one overnight admission three outpatient visit Clinical Translational Research Center Children 's Hospital Pittsburgh UPMC ( also call PCTRC ) . The total length study 7 week . Subjects blood work intravenous access line ( IV ) place several blood draw visit . Subjects begin fast 8pm admission , mean may consume non-caloric fluid ( water , unsweetened black coffee tea , sugar-free beverage ) . The next morning , fast blood work obtain . The subject eat breakfast receive study drug , Ravicti . The total time fast 12 hour . Dosing study begin 2 grams/m2/day , one-fifth ( 1/5 ) dose use disorder . The reason start dose low MCAD patient Ravicti metabolize MCAD enzyme . Following initial dose , blood drawn IV every two hour 8 hour . These blood study check level Ravicti subject 's blood monitor subject 's body metabolize . The subject discharge 8 hour drug administration . Following discharge , subject take Ravicti every day two week . Visit 2 : After two week dose 2 grams/m2/day , subject fast 8 PM , come PCTRC follow morning IV place blood draw . If subject 's blood work first visit show concern , subject 's dose increase 4 grams/m2/day . The subject receive first dose level PCTRC breakfast , blood sample collect IV every 2 hour next 8 hour . The subject continue dose two week . Visit 3 : After two week dose 4 grams/m2/day , subject fast 8 PM , come PCTRC follow morning IV place blood draw . If subject 's blood work previous visit show concern , subject 's dose increase 6 grams/m2/day . The subject receive first dose level PCTRC breakfast , blood sample collect IV every 2 hour next 8 hour . The subject continue dose two week . Visit 4 ( final ) : After two week dose 6 grams/m2/day , subject fast 8 PM , come CTRC follow morning one blood draw . The subject return unused Ravicti , study participation complete . All study procedures do cost subject .</detailed_description>
