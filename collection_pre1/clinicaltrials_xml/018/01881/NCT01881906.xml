	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate effect twelve week physical psycho-social program consisting : supervise , structure exercise train group advance lung cancer patient ( cardio strength training , relaxation training ) twice weekly . Primary outcome ( VO2peak ) . The hypothesis patient undergo intervention increase maximal oxygen uptake ( VO2peak ) , strength ( 1RM ) , functional capacity ( 6MWD ) quality life ( HRQOL ) reduce level anxiety depression compare .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Control - usual care The patient randomize control group receive training offer chance participate supervise training complete antineoplastic treatment , least twelve week . Patients early 2nd line treatment ( `` switch maintenance '' ) offer train 12 week , although complete chemotherapy . Intervention The supervised training carry group 12-16 patient session duration 1.5 hour , administer twice weekly supervise research physiotherapist . The training comprise warm exercise , strength fitness training well stretch . Warm exercise consist 10 minute light , stationery cycling , adjust 60-90 % patient 's maximum HR . Strength train carry use 6 machine ( Technogym : Leg press , chest press , lateral machine , leg extension , abdominal crunch , low back ) . The practical aim strength train complete 3 series 5-8 set , 70-90 % 1RM . The exercise specifically select involve large possible number muscle group least number exercise . To ensure progression strength training , patient instruct carry 1RM test use above-mentioned strength training machine every second week , program would adjust . Cardiovascular training carry interval training stationery bike . Intensity equivalent 85-95 % patient 's maximum HR last approximately 10-15 minute . After train session , 5-10 minute dedicate stretch large muscle group order increase agility . Following training session , progressive relaxation 15-20 minute perform . Pre train screen Each Patient screen clinical nurse specialist prior participate physical training session physiological test ( 35 ) . If one follow criterion meet , patient prohibit exercising/being test day : diastolic blood pressure &lt; 45 &gt; 95 , heart rate ( HR ) rest &gt; 115/min , temperature &gt; 38 0C , respiratory rate rest &gt; 30/min , infection require treatment , fresh bleeding , total leucocyte count &lt; 1.0 109/L platelet &lt; 50 109/L . Physical test HRQOL evaluation perform baseline six week train . Statistical analysis Sample size The applied calculation perform 55 patient basis VO2peak ; six week train 55 patient achieved increase 0.85 ml / kg / min VO2peak ( SD = 2,48 ) . It assume control group current study reduction 0.5 ml / kg / min VO2peak ( SD = 2.48 ) . Assumptions calculation patient number follow : Type 1 error 0.05 , type 2 error 0.20 , success level 1.35 , SD 2.48 . This lead total number patient 108 ( 54 arm ) . This study expect drop-out rate 50 % therefore another 108 patient must include , give sample size 216 patient . Data entry carry Open Clinica analysis perform use computer program SAS . As regard choice statistical test apply data continuous difference , analyze pair t-test corresponding non-parametric test , categorical data analyze use Pearson Ï‡2 test . Other data ( e.g. , questionnaire ) analyze use logistic regression chi square Mantel Haenzel test . Significance level set 0.05 .</detailed_description>
