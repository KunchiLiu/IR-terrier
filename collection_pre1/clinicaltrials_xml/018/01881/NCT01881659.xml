	<brief_summary>HPV test primary cervical cancer screen woman 30 year age likely become standard care near future many area world . Its high sensitivity significantly improve effectiveness screen program prolong negative predictive value allow extension screen interval . However , single HPV test low positive predictive value lead unnecessary workup over-treatment generate unnecessary distress . This multi-centric study screen 50,000 woman HPV test compare several triage approach follow HPV test order make HPV-based screening programme efficient , affordable sustainable .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study conduct several Latin American country . Currently , study start one site Colombia soon another site Mexico start . In participate center , woman age 30-64 year attend clinic cervical screening invite participate study . Women agree participate sign correspond Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve consent form undergo pelvic examination , cervical cell primary screening triage collect . Recruitment specimen use primary screen establish HPV DNA test ( Food Drug Administration FDA approve ) . All woman HPV-positive recruitment test refer standardized colposcopy examination diagnosis . At colposcopy visit , colposcopy perform , risk factor interview administer participant undergo visual inspection cervix acetic acid ( VIA ) collection additional cervical cell blood specimen . The result VIA disclose colposcopist . During colposcopy , colposcopists obtain ( 2-4 ) biopsies abnormally-appearing area ascertain neoplastic outcome ( CIN3+ ) direct treatment require . All woman attend colposcopy second round HPV test approximately 18 month recruitment HPV-positive refer colposcopy final diagnosis . Data management study supervision responsibility International Agency Research Cancer ( IARC ) local Principal Investigators , experience HPV researcher . The combined number histologically-confirmed diagnosis CIN3+ , include CIN2 lesion positive p16 , ( estimate n=500 ) outcome primary interest evaluation performance various triage modality . Our initial analysis focus comparison triage strategy employ single method : VIA , conventional/liquid-based cytology , HPV DNA genotyping , HPV RNA detection , detection E6 proteins high risk HPV type , marker HPV-induced cell-cycle alteration ( e.g. , p16 , ki67 , etc ) . To extent possible , molecular test HPV triage carry recruitment specimen simulate 'reflex test ' approach wherein screening triage do specimen without additional visit . Subsequent analysis consider various alternative strategy employ one triage methodology ; e.g. , HPV DNA genotyping follow cytology . The effectiveness cost alternative strategy assess various scenario feasibility , cost , effectiveness .</detailed_description>
