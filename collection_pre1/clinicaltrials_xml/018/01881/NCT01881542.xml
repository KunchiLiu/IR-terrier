	<brief_summary>Background project rationale : Preeclampsia common complication pregnancy , affect 6-8 % pregnancy constitute lead cause maternal morbidity mortality . Preeclampsia liable endanger live gravida fetus , particularly treatment initiate inappropriately untimely fashion . Diagnosis preeclampsia dependent find proteinuria , determine 300mg protein 24 hour urine sample . However , urine collection span 24 hour sometimes constitute `` bottleneck '' , extend time diagnosis preeclampsia . Additionally , collection urine 24 hour entails degree discomfort , require woman proximity collection vessel , increase length hospital admission . The use abbreviate test may permit diagnosis treatment timely fashion . Similarly , ability exclude diagnosis rapidly could reduce length hospital stay consumption health system 's limited resource . Further , short test may reduce discomfort associate 24-hour test thus increase compliance . Previous research suggest briefer test correlate traditional 24 hour urine collection , however study base small study population . Research Objective : To validate brief rapid test diagnosis urinary protein excretion . To assess whether , woman suspect preeclampsia , difference exists protein excretion daytime night . Methods : Urine collection perform pregnant woman admit investigation suspect preeclampsia , volume record sample take 6 , 12 24 hour interval assessment urinary protein content . As , comparison make protein excretion 6 12 hour full 24 hour period ; addition , comparison make daytime nighttime urinary protein excretion . The result allow assessment whether short test substitute full 24 hour collection diagnosis preeclampsia ; result woman show suffer preeclampsia use ass whether short test rule disease . Additionally urine sample protein/creatinine ratio examine correlated result different collection period .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Literature review project rationale : Preeclampsia common complication pregnancy , affect 6-8 % pregnancy constitute lead cause maternal morbidity mortality . Preeclampsia liable endanger live gravida fetus , particularly treatment initiate inappropriately untimely fashion . The diagnosis preeclampsia base finding raise blood pressure ( 140/90mmHg ) presence proteinuria . The accepted mean measure proteinuria 24-hour urine collection , pathological value define 300mg great 24 hour period . When proteinuria great 5000mg 24 hour , pr-eclampsia classify severe endangers live expectant mother fetus often result early delivery . Diagnosis assessment severity preeclampsia require timely situation assessment . Urine collection span 24 hour sometimes constitute `` bottleneck '' , extend time diagnosis preeclampsia . Additionally , collection urine 24 hour entails degree discomfort , require woman proximity collection vessel , increase length hospital admission . The use abbreviate test may permit diagnosis treatment timely fashion . Similarly , ability exclude diagnosis rapidly could reduce length hospital stay consumption health system 's limited resource . Further , short test may reduce discomfort associate 24-hour test thus increase compliance . Previous research show 8-hour urine collection indeed produce result parallel 24-hour collection , recent research also demonstrate concordance 12-hour 24-hour urine collection . That say , study base small sample population , few 100 woman . Another study woman preeclampsia show good correlation result urinary protein sample collect 12 hour night collect 12 hour daytime . Research Assumptions : 1. urine collection period time le 24 hour reflect degree urinary protein excretion . 2. urine collection period time le 24 hour constitute alternative test 24-hour urine collection , accept diagnostic test today . Research Objective : To validate brief rapid test diagnosis urinary protein excretion . To assess whether , woman suspect preeclampsia , difference exists protein excretion daytime night . Methods : Urine collection perform every pregnant admit investigation suspect preeclampsia . After 6 , 12 24 hour sample collect urine take protein concentration assessment . Quantitative urinary protein establish accord urinary protein concentration collect urine volume . Results test 6 12 hour compare final result 24 hour , test choice diagnosis proteinuria preeclampsia thus test determine management ( accord department protocol ) . Women preeclampsia rule ( viz , underwent investigation follow raise BP without find proteinuria ) serve assess ability short urine collection rule proteinuria , , preeclampsia . So assess whether difference result daytime urinary protein excretion night , urine collection perform two vessel follow : 1 . 8:00am - begin urine collection 2 . 2:00pm , vessel 1 - recording collected urine volume , removal 10mL sample urine protein concentration test . 3 . 8:00pm , vessel 1 - recording total collected urine volume , removal 10mL sample urine protein concentration test . point urine collection continue second vessel 4 . 8:00am follow morning , vessel 2 - recording collected urine volume 8:00pm ( previous 12 hour ) , removal 10mL sample urine protein concentration test . 5. content two vessel mixed , 24 hour urine volume record 10mL sample take , sample establish result 24 hour urine collection . Additionally urine sample protein/creatinine ratio examine correlated result different collection period .</detailed_description>
