	<brief_summary>The study aim compare outcome Electroconvulsive Therapy ( ECT ) use ketamine versus methohexital anesthesia depress patient . The investigator hypothesize patient receive ketamine anesthesia ECT achieve remission status faster receive methohexital anesthesia . Also , end ECT course subject display few cognitive side effect compare treated methohexital anesthesia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ketamine Augmentation Strategy Electroconvulsive Therapy ( ECT ) Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite major advance treatment mood disorder , depression remain serious public health problem . Delayed onset response lack efficacy significant portion patient limitation pharmacotherapy . Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) show provide fast amelioration depressive symptom efficacy report 65 85 % . However , one main limit factor use cognitive impairment , directly relate number ECT session . There increased evidence mediation glutamate pathophysiology depression , suggest potential antidepressant effect drug modulate glutamate transmission . Open study recent case report demonstrate rapid antidepressant effect intravenous ketamine - non-competitive antagonist glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor . Ketamine general anesthetic use commonly procedural sedation . Ketamine anticonvulsant property . It use alternative methohexital - barbiturate anticonvulsant property - patient high seizure threshold . A recent open non-randomized trial Okamoto show fast response ECT give ketamine anesthesia . In recent review Gregory-Roberts et al suggest available evidence animal human support prediction ketamine could effectively prevent ECT -induced persistent retrograde amnesia improve hasten therapeutic response . We propose double-blind randomize control pilot study measure therapeutic efficacy cognitive side effect ECT use ketamine compare methohexital - gold standard anesthetic ECT - depressed patient . Thirty patient schedule receive acute course ECT major depressive episode . Inpatients outpatient screen ECT psychiatrist participate study . Patients able willing provide write informed consent randomly assign 1:1 ratio receive either course bifrontal ECT use ketamine 1-2 mg/kg methohexital anesthesia0.5-1.0 mg/kg . Subjects receive standard acute course ECT ( 3X/week . Raters subject mask group assignment . Parallel procedure also collect magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) data subject . The timeline neuroimaging relation ECT baseline MRI prior first ECT , follow MRI first ECT ( &lt; 36hrs ) , final MRI 9 ECTs patient remit . All subject receive structural ( i.e . diffusion tensor image spectroscopy ) functional MRI exam . In addition imaging procedure detail , also plan acquire image data healthy individual similar timeline . Healthy volunteer scan three time ; first second scan 24-48 hour apart , second third scan two week apart . The imaging session follow protocol patient . The collection control data necessary order demonstrate imaging finding due acclimatization scanner environment confound source . Compensation participate MRI component $ 75 per MRI .</detailed_description>
