	<brief_summary>Patients present painful procedure Emergency Department ( ED ) show frequently inadequate pain management . The incision drainage ( I &amp; D ) abscess common procedure view many emergency physician require localize anesthetic pain management . However , document previous research disconnect emergency medicine physician interpret painful patient experience pain . A trial conducted focus use intramuscular ( IM ) Fentanyl intervention help alleviate pain associate incision drainage abscess . This procedure rarely receive systemic opioids . This double blind protocol randomize total 50 patient patient abscess receive either combination Fentanyl IM follow subcutaneous ( SC ) local bupivicaine analgesia Normal Saline IM follow SC local bupivicaine analgesia . Only opiate naive patient enrol . The primary outcome study patient overall satisfaction procedure , patient level pain associated procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients present painful procedure Emergency Department ( ED ) show frequently inadequate pain management . The incision drainage abscess common procedure usually treat emergency physician localize anesthetic pain management . For abscess require incision drainage , physician usually inject local anesthetic help decrease sensation affected area prior incision drainage . Occasionally , physician administer systemic pain medication , addition localize anesthetic , method good help alleviate pain associate complex procedure . Wilson Pendleton ( 1989 ) write landmark study highlight problem physician undertreating patient pain ED , problem know oligoanalgesia . They find 50 % patient moderate severe pain receive narcotic . Since literature highlight number additional deficit use pain medication ED include amount time take patient receive medication , lack education medical personnel receive pain management , bias physician toward use pain medication , lack pain medication give painful procedure . Five area inadequate management painful condition ED include 1 ) failure acknowledge pain , 2 ) failure assess initial pain , 3 ) failure pain management guideline , 4 ) failure document pain assess treatment adequacy , 5 ) failure meet patient expectation . The use adequate pain medication painful procedure cover recent attempt fill gap one area contribute oligoanalgesia . Incision drainage procedure common condition emergency physician manage yet evidence suggest whether appropriately manage pain associate treatment . We propose trial determine whether intramuscular ( IM ) Fentanyl , give prior incision drainage abscess , decrease level pain during/after procedure increase patient overall satisfaction procedure . This double blind protocol randomize 50 patient abscesses receive either combination intramuscular injection Fentanyl follow subcutaneous ( SC ) local bupivacaine analgesia ( Fentanyl Group ) , combination intramuscular injection normal saline ( Control Group ) IM follow SC local bupivacaine analgesia . Patients receive questioner administer research assistant procedure ass outcomes study . Neither treat physician , nurse patient research assistant aware group patient randomize . Fentanyl chosen due rapidity onset ( 7-8 minute ) clearance ( 1-2 hour ) . The choice abscess make give ease make diagnosis , standard treatment incision drainage know association pain procedure . After appropriate identification , screening , consent , patient randomize receive intramuscular Fentanyl ( 1 ug/kg ) OR Normal Saline ( 1.5 ml ) 7-8 minute procedure begin . Patients either group still receive usual care local subcutaneous bupivacaine anesthetic . Patients liberty request local subcutaneous bupivacaine pain systemic pain medication treat provider may deliver discretion . Contamination may occur patient receive IM Normal Saline request systemic narcotic pain level control local bupivacaine alone . These patient may receive systemic narcotic discretion treat provider . However patient remain initial group assign data evaluate intention treat analysis basis .</detailed_description>
