	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess effect disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug ( DMARDs ) dose reduction patient rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . Remission treatment target RA , knowledge best way treat RA patient achieve sustain remission limit . DMARDs potential serious adverse event , biologic DMARDs costly society . The objective ARCTIC REWIND assess effect taper withdrawal DMARDs disease activity RA patient sustain remission , study predictor successful taper withdrawal DMARDs patient group , study cost-effectiveness different treatment option RA remission . ARCTIC REWIND randomize , open , control , parallel-group , multicenter , phase IV , non-inferiority strategy study . Patients less five year disease duration stable remission least 12 month randomize either continued stable treatment taper withdrawal DMARDs , include tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) inhibitor synthetic DMARDs . Patients assess clinical examination , patient report outcome measure , ultrasonography , MRI X-ray , monitor adverse event . The primary endpoint study proportion patient non-failures ( experienced flare ) 12 month . Secondary endpoint include composite disease activity score remission criterion , joint damage inflammation assess various image modality , work participation , health care resource use health relate quality life .</brief_summary>
