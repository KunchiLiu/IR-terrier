	<brief_title>Imaging Tumor Hypoxia With 18F-EF5 PET Recurrent Metastatic Clear Cell Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study involve one visit BCCA - Vancouver Centre undergo one EF5-PET/CT scan . The visit take 4 hour complete follow-up visit require . - Participants fill short medical questionnaire ask routine information ( treatment history , previous surgery , medication , allergy , etc . ) take 5-10 minute complete . - Next weighed vital sign measure ( blood pressure , heart rate blood oxygen saturation ) . - An IV insert vein participant 's arm . At , small amount blood take measure blood glucose level . - The participant receive IV dose 18F-EF5 . - Five minute injection , blood pressure heart rate check . - Participants free leave functional imaging department period 180 minute 18F-EF5 circulates throughout body . Participants free eat normal period . - Participants undergo 18F-EF5 PET scan , take 20 minute . The participant need lie still scanner bed entire scan . - The 18F-EF5 PET scan review BC Cancer Agency doctor specialized PET result send refer doctor . Optional Biopsy Procedure : Participants opportunity participate optional biopsy procedure purpose study contemporaneous tumour tissue ( contemporaneous EF5-PET ) marker hypoxia , apoptosis , angiogenesis etc . The tissue also compare archival material , allow researcher study evolve change tumours follow treatment . Patients consent undergo biopsy book Diagnostic Imaging Department Vancouver Centre . Ultrasound guidance use obtain 5 core biopsy accessible lesion ( ) . Up 2 distinct tumour area may sample . The standard procedure require core biopsy follow , include pre-biopsy lab test , sterile technique , need , post biopsy observation . The core biopsy formalin fix paraffin embed ( FFPE ) . A BCCA pathologist review representative slide paraffin block ensure presence tumour tissue . The FFPE block send laboratory immunohistochemistry stain interpretation .</detailed_description>
