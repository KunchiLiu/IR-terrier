	<brief_title>Acupuncture Prevent Chemotherapy Dose Reduction Due Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy Breast Colorectal Cancer Patients ( GCC1232 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-center , pilot ( phase IIb ) , randomize , standard care- placebo ( sham acupuncture ) -controlled clinical trial ( N=60 ) assess effect acupuncture prevent chemotherapy dose reduction due chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy ( CIPN ) elucidate mechanism action . Breast colorectal cancer patient receive neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy contain neurotoxic agent ( taxanes oxaliplatin ) University Maryland Marlene &amp; Stewart Greenebaum Cancer Center ( UMGCC ) screen CIPN . Once patient develop great equal National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria ( NCI-CTC ) grade 2 CIPN , recruit study . Severity CIPN define NCI-CTC list Appendix A . Patients stratify base cancer type ( breast cancer v colorectal cancer ) . The patient randomly assign one three arm : ( A ) real acupuncture , ( B ) sham acupuncture ( C ) standard care . All patient follow chemotherapy dose reduction algorithm ( Appendix B ) . No concomitant anti-neuropathy medication allow . Patients intervention arm randomly assign undergo weekly real sham acupuncture end chemotherapy . In two arm , patient , patient 's medical oncologist , pharmacist , research nurse , study coordinator blind treatment assignment . In standard care arm , patient receive additional therapy CIPN . Their CIPN manage accord standard chemotherapy dose reduction algorithm . In arm , chemotherapy dose document patient 's schedule chemotherapy session . The chemotherapy relative dose intensity ( RDI ) calculate end chemotherapy . Validated patient-reported outcome questionnaire : Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy/ Gynecologic Oncology Group-Neurotoxicity ( FACT/GOG-Ntx ) questionnaire Neuropathy Pain Scale ( NPS ) , describe later , use ass CIPN severity weekly patient end chemotherapy 4 week follow . Nerve conduction study perform neurologist baseline chemotherapy finish . Side effect real sham acupuncture record weekly . Approximately 4 ml blood drawn patient real sham acupuncture treatment , routine weekly blood work check ( standard care arm ) , end chemotherapy , 4 week follow measure change nerve growth factor neurotrophic factor brain-derived neurotrophic factor , neurotrophin-3 , insulin-like growth factor , vascular endothelial growth factor . They analyze cytokine lab University Maryland School Medicine ( UMSOM ) .</detailed_description>
