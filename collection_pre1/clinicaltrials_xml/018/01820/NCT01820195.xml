	<brief_summary>There many controversy role N-Acetyl Cystein prevent contrast nephropathy . These contradictory result may due different criterion patient ' selection , different end point , different type dose N-Acetyl Cystein administration finally different prophylactic measure N-Acetyl Cystein . The investigator try enroll double blind double dummy study good power compare effect drug form oral intravenous placebo prevent contrast nephropathy patient undergo coronary angiography/angioplasty .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Contrast Nephropathy third cause acute kidney injury hospitalize patient . The morbidity mortality disorder considerable . There treatment condition measure take account prevent complication . Among prophylactic measure hydration dose ant type contrast factor prove effective prevent contrast nephropathy . N-Acetyl Cystein antioxidant agent may effective different aspect medicine , , use condition controversial . While study show effective prevention contrast nephropathy , others show benefit . Different study use different dose route administration . So clinical trial good power need compare different oral Vs IV administration drug randomize double blind clinical trial . In study allocate eligible patient chronic kidney disease stag 2 4 three group . Oral N-Acetyl Cystein group , IV N-Acetyl Cystein group , placebo group . All group match accord stage chronic kidney disease , diabetes , anemia , heart failure , age sex .</detailed_description>
