	<brief_summary>The Phase Ib part study aim determine maximum tolerate dose/recommended Phase II dose ( MTD/RP2D ) daily buparlisib combination every-three-week carboplatin paclitaxel patient previously untreated metastatic squamous NSCLC . The purpose Phase II portion study ass treatment effect add buparlisib versus buparlisib-matching placebo every-three-week carboplatin paclitaxel progression free survival ( PFS ) patient previously untreated metastatic squamous NSCLC .</brief_summary>
