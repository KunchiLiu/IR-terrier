	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose tretinoin give together lithium carbonate treat patient relapsed refractory acute myeloid leukemia . Lithium carbonate may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Tretinoin may help [ type cancer ] cell become like normal cell , grow spread slowly . Giving lithium carbonate together tretinoin may kill cancer cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lithium Carbonate Tretinoin Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety maximum tolerate dose combination tretinoin lithium carbonate subject non promyelocytic acute myeloid leukemia . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe dose limit toxicity associate combination lithium ( lithium carbonate ) tretinoin . II . To determine ability lithium inhibit glycogen synthase kinase-3 ( GSK3 ) activity circulate acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) cell enhance retinoic acid receptor expression . III . To determine ability lithium tretinoin induce differentiation and/or growth inhibition AML cell . IV . To determine response rate acute myeloid treatment treatment combination Tretinoin Lithium . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study tretinoin . Patients receive tretinoin orally ( PO ) every 12 hour day 1-7 15-21 lithium carbonate PO three time daily ( TID ) day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
