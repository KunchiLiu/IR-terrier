	<brief_summary>Bacterial infection frequent complication liver cirrhosis bad prognosis . However , clinical outcome cirrhotic patient serious infection significantly improve last 30 year due early diagnosis use appropriate antibiotic therapy . As general population , empirical treatment initiate soon diagnosis , make necessary sampling base use antibiotic low toxicity broad spectrum antibacterial efficacy , take account local epidemiology prevalence antibiotic resistance . The third generation cephalosporin consider gold standard treatment infection cirrhotics due effectiveness enterobacteriaceae non-enterococcal streptococci due low toxicity . However , recommendation antibiotic therapy currently base result trial '80s '90s , proportion resistant pathogens low . Similarly nosocomial infection , increase rate infection due multidrug resistant ( MDR ) bacteria represent rational different choice empirical antibiotic therapy high resistance barrier . This change epidemiology community acquire infection mainly due increase contact healthcare system patient large use antibiotic prophylaxis . With regard , recently propose introduce third epidemiological class infection `` Health care-associated '' : Infections occur community patient contact health system shortly infection . This epidemiological class infection distinguish `` community-acquired '' similar '' nosocomial '' term sensitivity antibiotic . Therefore class take consideration use different empirical antibiotic therapy . The investigator aim evaluate prospectively effectiveness broad spectrum antibiotic treatment cohort cirrhotic patient `` healthcare-Associated '' infection Cirrhotic patient `` Healthcare Associated '' admit gastroenterology department Policlinico Umberto I Department Hepatology Hospital Marino consecutively enrol . Randomized control trial randomisation stratify epidemiological class infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Unblinded randomize controlled trial randomisation stratify epidemiological class infection . After obtain informed consent enrollment , participant undergo medical examination detail anamnesis begin collect data follow parameter : - Demographic characteristic ( age , sex , etiology cirrhosis , diagnosis make ) . - Severity liver disease ( define Child-Pugh classification , MELD score ) , indices renal function serum electrolytes . - APACHE score case development sepsis - Compensated cirrhosis / decompensated cirrhosis - If decompensated , list complication ( ascites , esophageal-gastric varix , hepatic encephalopathy , coagulopathy , Hepato-Renal Syndrome , variceal bleeding ) . - Treatment dosage ( eg Î²-blockers , diuretic ) - Hemodynamic parameter ( heart rate / blood pressure ) Patients enrol randomize treated conventional therapy provide community-acquired infection `` 2nd line antibiotic therapy '' , base use imipenem-cilastatin . The protocol antibiotic therapy choose category patient base antibiotic class recommend specific site infection international guideline treatment nosocomial infection / healthcare associate high safety profile already use investigator hospital . The cost empirical treatment imipenem / cilastatin roughly comparable currently use first-line antibiotic infection , frequently use drug forefront patient ineffective therefore necessary embark new antibiotic high cost also term day hospitalization . During hospitalization record type infection , empirical therapy , duration , side effect , isolate pathogen resistance , available , occurrence complication related infection mortality . The efficacy therapy assess base resolution infection attest normalization clinical , biochemical microbiological parameter instrumental tool .</detailed_description>
