	<brief_summary>Although contemporary cataract surgery make tremendous stride technological advancement , posterior capsular opacification ( PCO ) still frequent long-term complication lead decrease visual function thereby dissatisfy result . A great deal effort make develop new way prevent formation PCO . A key factor , widely discuss literature , material design intraocular lense ( IOL ) edge lead PCO prevention . It still clear whether sharp-edged IOL produce less PCO optic geometry alone whether biomaterial contributes inhibition PCO . With clinical introduction single‐piece acrylic hydrophobic IOLs optic haptic design difference compare three‐piece acrylic hydrophobic IOLs , become possible determine influence IOL material design PCO prevention . It well establish development PCO dynamic process longer follow-up time correlate high degree PCO . So far , prospective clinical study clinical result single three‐piece acrylic hydrophobic foldable IOLs . However , question whether PCO increase become stable regress long-term basis yet answer . Since paucity available literature prospectively evaluate development PCO implantation single-piece SN60AT hydrophobic acrylic IOL long-term basis , investigator decide observe degree development PCO 5 year cataract surgery .</brief_summary>
