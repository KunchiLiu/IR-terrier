	<brief_title>Diagnosis Patients With Low Intermediate Suspicion SAHS With Comorbidity : Standard Laboratory Polysomnography Compared With Three Nights Home Respiratory Polygraphy .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study subject The study population consist subject refer sleep unit Clínic Hospital , Barcelona , Spain , San Pedro de Alcantara Hospital , Cáceres , Spain , mild-moderate clinical suspicion OSA notorious co-morbidity induced frequent symptom mimic OSA could reduce sleep time . The inclusion criterion : ) Patients snore and/or observe apneas sleep . b ) Epworth scale le 15. c ) Subjects notorious co-morbidity . ) Age 18 75 year . The exclusion criterion follow : high suspicion sleep apnea ( heavy snoring , breathe pause somnolence make social life work difficult , without cause hypersomnia ) ; diagnosis OSA ; severe heart disease resistant systemic hypertension ; suspicion non-apneic sleep disorder , narcolepsy , REM behavior disorder , restless leg syndrome ; psychophysical disability would impede application home polygraphy device major co-morbidity ( unstable heart disease , unstable pulmonary disease disable stroke ) ; lack informed consent protocol approve ethic committee two centre . Protocol We compare 3N-HRP laboratory-standard PSG randomize patient meet inclusion exclusion criterion . The subject study random basis one night sleep lab ( standard PSG ) three consecutive night HRP . Once first test start , second test schedule within follow two day . PSG HRP score separately technician physician blind identify information patient , well previous result . Measurements Clinical data : Gender , age , weight , height , body mass index ( BMI ) , waist-hip ratio , neck circumference , systolic diastolic blood pressure , alcohol intake measure ≤ 60 gr/day &gt; 60 gr/day , tobacco consumption . Co-morbidity : Notable cardiovascular , metabolic lung disease , well diagnosis insomnia , anxiety , depression , fibromyalgia , chronic fatigue syndrome , psychiatric treatment . Symptoms related OSA : Episodes nocturnal choking , nocturia , morning headache , morning tiredness . These data collect four degree intensity ( never , sometimes , frequently , always ) . Sleepiness measure Epworth Sleepiness Scale American Sleep Disorders Association Sleepiness Scale ( ASDA ) . Other questionnaire : ) FOSQ ( Functional Outcomes Sleep Questionnaire ) , assess impact excessive sleepiness multiple activity everyday . b ) Euroqol-5D ( EQ-5D ) , standardized instrument use measure health outcome . Sleep study . Standard laboratory PSG ( Somté PSG , Compumedics Limited 2006 , Abbotsford , Victoria , Australia ) perform accord technical specification American Academy Sleep Medicine ( AASM ) . The recorded variable electroencephalogram ( EEG ) , derivation F4-M1 , C4-M1 , O2-M1 ; electro-oculogram ( EOG ) ; chin electromyogram ( EMG ) ; leg electromyogram ; electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . Respiratory variable measure linearized nasal pressure prong oronasal thermal flow waveform ; respiratory effort signal measure inductive band record rib-cage abdominal movement ; oxygen saturation ; body position snore . A type 3 portable sleep apnea test use perform HRP ( Sleep &amp; Go , Bitmed , Sibel S.A. Barcelona , Spain ) . Recorded variable : flow measure linearized nasal pressure prong , thermal flow , body position , rib-cage abdominal movement measure inductive band , oxygen saturation . After detailed explanation use HRP device ( set-up withdrawal ) hospital setting , take home return patient three home study . A valid PSG HRP least 180 recorded minute . Moreover , valid HRP least 3 hour flow band oximetry measurement score . The period consider `` awake '' erratic breathing consider scoring . Mean value obtain three night HRP . If one study consider valid , remove mean value obtain two night HRP . If two study patient consider valid , patient exclude . The PSG HRP score manually , separately , blind independent technician . Sleep stag perform use standardize AASM criterion . The respiratory variable obtain HRP PSG score accord AASM criterion : apnea define drop peak signal excursion ≈90 % pre-event baseline duration ≥ 10 second ; hypopnea define discernible reduction amplitude airflow signal ( ≈30 % pre-event baseline ) least 10 second duration , associate arousal and/or ≥ 3 % oxygen desaturation pre-event baseline . For HRP , hypopnea define discernible reduction amplitude airflow signal ( ≈30 % pre-event baseline ) least 10 second duration , associate ≥ 3 % oxygen desaturation . Therapeutic decision-making In addition real treatment decision physicians two sleep unit , 15 reviewer ( five sleep medicine specialist ; five respiratory physician ; five respiratory resident physician train least 3 month sleep lab ) 5 sleep laboratory Spain , via website show clinical data patient data sleep study , take therapeutic decision . The reviewer choose one two option : 1 ) CPAP treatment ; 2 ) CPAP treatment/other therapeutic measure . Each patient present twice ( PSG HRP information ) , blind non-consecutively . The criterion recommend CPAP AHI 5 30 significant symptom consequence AHI ≥30 , take less account symptom consequence , accord Spanish Sleep Network guideline . Statistics It estimate , accept alpha risk 0.05 beta risk 0.2 two-sided test , 55 subject need minimum difference AHI 7.0 unit recognize statistically significant . The standard deviation assume 18 . A dropout rate 5 % anticipate . Outcomes studied statistical analysis The mean data obtain 3N-HRP compare PSG data . Student 's t-test Bland-Altman plot use determine agreement AHI measurement obtain PSG HRP . ANOVA use assess variability night HRP . The efficacy diagnostic test evaluate use sensitivity specificity ; positive negative likelihood ratio [ LR ( + ) LR ( - ) ] ; percentage patient positive negative diagnosis . The post-test probability obtain true positive test positive negative calculate , base pre-test probability ( prevalence disease ) positive negative LRs . Receiver operate characteristic ( ROC ) curve plotted mean 3N-HRP different polysomnographic AHI cut-off point ( ≥5 , ≥10 , ≥15 , ≥ 30 ) OSA diagnosis determine best ROC curve base area curve ( AUC ) measurement . Therapeutic decision make The reviewer group sleep medicine specialist , respiratory medicine physician resident physician . A median therapeutic decision group obtain . Agreement level ( 100 minus sum false positives negative ) Cohen 's kappa coefficient use determine agreement therapeutic decision . All analyse develop `` Statistical Package Social Sciences '' ( SPSS , 21.0 Windows ; SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL ) . Cost analysis We consider cost diagnostic strategy analysis two equally effective alternative . Test , patient total cost PSG HRP The estimated test cost PSG HRP obtain financial department two hospital involve . These cost include follow : personnel involve , equipment depreciation , fungible material . Patient cost estimate accord average cost patient travel home hospital back taxi . We consider round trip hospital case PSG two round trip pick return HRP device . To estimate cost per patient , test patient cost divide number patient valid record . To obtain total cost PSG HRP add test patient cost . Test , patient total cost equal diagnostic efficacy PSG HRP For PSG , test cost equal diagnostic efficacy sum test cost cost repeat PSGs due invalid recording . For HRP , test cost equal diagnostic efficacy sum test cost following : cost PSG patient invalid HRP recording ; cost PSG patient indeterminate diagnostic result ( `` gray zone '' ) false positive false negative result . To calculate patient cost equal diagnostic efficacy , also consider transport cost due repetition test . To calculate cost per patient , cost divide number patient complete trial . Total PSG HRP cost equal diagnostic efficacy obtain add test patient cost .</detailed_description>
