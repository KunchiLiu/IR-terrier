	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate whether combination neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( chemotherapy surgery ) plus ipilimumab lung cancer increase number patient detectable circulate T cell specificities tumor associate antigen ( TAA ) zero percent ( 0 % ) patient prior therapy 20 % patient neoadjuvant chemotherapy plus ipilimumab . This open label Phase 2 trial . Patients clinical stage IB ( &gt; 4 cm ) , II , ( N0-2 ) non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) prior therapy current diagnosis lung cancer eligible study . Subjects receive 3 cycle neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( paclitaxel + cisplatin/carboplatin ) . Ipilimumab administer Cycles 2 3 standard chemotherapy 4 cycle alone surgery . Subjects undergo standard clinically indicated surgical resection lung cancer deem appropriate surgeon . Standard diagnostic staging work perform include : pathologic/histologic diagnosis NSCLC , Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) /Computed Tomography ( CT ) scan , brain imaging , mediastinoscopy . Three cycle neoadjuvant chemotherapy give . Ipilimumab add neoadjuvant chemotherapy cycle 2 3 . Standard surgical evaluation therapy perform follow completion neoadjuvant therapy . Two cycle single agent ipilimumab give surgery ( adjuvantly ) , follow 2 cycle maintenance therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator propose study cell mediate effect ipilimumab combination chemotherapy neoadjuvant setting NSCLC . The overall immune assessment strategy propose ipilimumab neoadjuvant trial base hypothesis 1 ) T cell specificities tumor associate antigen express patient 's progressing NSCLC present , functionally impaired , baseline , 2 ) immunomodulatory effect chemotherapy plus ipilimumab impact suppressive mechanism , restore functional reactivity important anti-tumor effector cell population . An important potential biomarker anti-tumor immune response proliferation stimulation circulate T cell specificities tumor associate antigen ( TAA ) . At baseline patient cancer population circulate T cell specificities TAA detectable level 0.05 % CD8 lymphocytes . The primary endpoint clinical trial determine addition ipilimumab neoadjuvant chemotherapy non-small cell lung cancer increase percentage patient circulate T cell specificities TAA . We also measure tumor infiltrating lymphocyte resect tumor . Study Interventions : The investigational agent , ipilimumab , add neoadjuvant chemotherapy cycle 2 3 . Standard surgical evaluation therapy perform follow completion neoadjuvant therapy . Two cycle single agent ipilimumab give surgery ( adjuvantly ) , follow 2 cycle maintenance therapy . Neoadjuvant : Cycle 1 : Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 IV 3 hour follow cisplatin 75 mg/m2 60 minute carboplatin AUC ( Area Under Curve ) 6 ( cap 900 mg ) 30-60 minute day 1 ( every 21 day x 1 cycle ) Cycles 2 3 : Ipilimumab 10mg/kg IV 90 minute , Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 3 hour follow cisplatin 75 mg/m2 carboplatin AUC 6 ( cap 900 mg ) IV 30-60 minute ( every 21 day x 2 cycle ) Surgery : Standard surgical evaluation occur least 21 day last dose ( Cycle 3 ) chemotherapy follow surgical therapy . Post-surgical Therapy : ( Total 4 dos ipilimumab give post-operatively ) : Adjuvant : Ipilimumab 10 mg/kg IV every 3 week x 2 dos , begin 4 week postoperative ( 10 week need recovery ) Maintenance : Ipilimumab 10 mg/kg IV every 12 week x 2 dos Correlative Science Measures : Study specific research blood tissue test ( ) conduct : Blood Specimens : •Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) isolate freshly draw anti-coagulated blood analyze circulate T cell specificities tumor-associated antigen ( TAA ) 4 time point , namely 1 ) Baseline prior treatment , 2 ) cycle 2 , prior ipilimumab therapy , 3 ) 21-36 day completion cycle 3 chemotherapy prior surgery , 4 ) 3-6 week adjuvant ipilimumab dose # 2 . Additionally , PBMC time point analyze presence circulating population regulatory T cell , myeloid-derived suppressor cell ( MDSC ) , well activate exhaust T cell . Tissue Specimens : •Tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TILs ) isolate patient 's resected tumor analyze infiltrate T cell specificities tumor-associated antigen . Additionally , TIL analyze presence infiltrating population regulatory T cell , myeloid-derived suppressor cell ( MDSC ) , well activate exhaust T cell .</detailed_description>
