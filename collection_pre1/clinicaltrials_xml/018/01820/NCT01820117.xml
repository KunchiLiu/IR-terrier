	<brief_summary>While thoracic radiation therapy ( TRT ) primary component successful treatment variety childhood adult cancer , exposure treatment associate significant cardiovascular pulmonary morbidity long-term survivor . Within non-cancer population , cardiovascular pulmonary morbidity associate increase risk cerebral vascular accident ( CVAs ) , accelerate brain atrophy neurocognitive impairment . Patients chronic heart disease demonstrate problem attention , process speed , memory , executive function . Chronic pulmonary disease also increase risk stroke , leukoencephalopathy , neurocognitive impairment non-cancer population . The investigator propose examine index brain integrity , include neurocognitive performance brain MRI/MRA , long-term adult survivor Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) treat thoracic radiation direct central nervous system therapy . OBJECTIVES : 1 . To evaluate brain integrity adult survivor childhood HL treat thoracic radiation therapy . 2 . To identify therapeutic factor associate brain integrity adult survivor childhood HL risk cardiac pulmonary morbidity . 3 . To examine association cardiac , vascular pulmonary health brain integrity adult survivor childhood HL treat thoracic radiation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This observational study collect health data long-term survivor Hodgkin lymphoma ( HL ) . Data collect participant enrollment . The long-term effect thoracic radiation therapy ( TRT ) give earlier part treatment HL examine long-term survivor compare health data collect normal volunteer . HL survivor treat St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital ( SJCRH ) TRT recruit complete comprehensive neurocognitive evaluation , brain MRI/MRA , clinical neurological exam , peripheral pulse contour analysis , non-invasive central blood pressure monitoring , cardiopulmonary exercise testing , serum biomarkers related cardiac disease . As part standard St. Jude LIFE protocol evaluation , also complete echocardiogram , pulmonary function test questionnaire design evaluate broad health , psychological , socioeconomic environmental factor impact everyday life . A comparison sample healthy individual , frequency-matched age , sex race also recruit . The comparison group complete comprehensive neurocognitive evaluation , brain MRI/MRA , clinical neurological exam , pulse contour analysis , non-invasive central blood pressure monitoring , cardiopulmonary exercise testing . Through St. Jude LIFE protocol , comparison sample also complete echocardiogram , pulmonary function test questionnaire design evaluate broad health , psychological , socioeconomic environmental factor impact everyday life .</detailed_description>
