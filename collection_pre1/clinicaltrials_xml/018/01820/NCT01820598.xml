	<brief_summary>The study design test follow hypothesis : In patient severe obesity , multisite electrostimulation session ( m-NMES ) induce high change metabolic , inflammatory cardiovascular parameter higher increase muscle strength stimulate contraction conventional unidirectional electrostimulation session ( c-NMES ) . In patient severe obesity , six-weeks m-NMES training program enhance cardiovascular , metabolic inflammatory parameter .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Neuromuscular Electrical Multisite System Cardiovascular Effects Severe Obese Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Physical activity know reduce cardiovascular risk far even minor change lifestyle could occur . In obesity , physical activity program remain challenge due multifactorial cause relate body mass shortness breath , traumatological pain psychosocial cause . Although neuromuscular electrical stimulation train presently ignore management obesity , technique may appropriate useful muscle deconditioning patient . Furthermore , direct effect electrostimulation train program vascular function previously report spinal cord injury chronic heart disease , suggest improvement cardiovascular function may expect . While promise new technique multisite electrical stimulation ( Kneehab® system ) recently commercialize , study investigate acute effect electrostimulation vascular function study report effect electrical stimulation obese patient . MAIN OUTCOME OF THE ACUTE PHASE STUDY ( 1st part ) : To study effect multisite electrical stimulation session ( m-NMES ) arterial stiffness compare conventional unidirectional electrical stimulation session ( c-NMES ) patient severe obesity . Secondary outcome observational study : 1/ To study effect m-NMES endothelial function , blood pressure , systemic inflammation metabolic status ( fast glucose insulin ) well electrically-induced muscle fatigue compare c-NMES patient morbid obesity . 2/ To study profile responder electrical stimulation accord body composition , 6-minute walking distance , spontaneous physical activity susceptibility tolerate electrical stimulation . Response electrical stimulation assess improvement arterial stiffness stimulation , . MAIN OUTCOME OF THE INTERVENTIONAL STUDY ( 2nd part ) : To study effect multisite electrical stimulation training program ( m-NMES ) ( 6 week , 30 session ) arterial stiffness patient severe obesity . Secondary outcome interventional study : To study effect m-NMES endothelial function , blood pressure , systemic inflammation metabolic status ( fast glucose insulin ) well muscle strength , body composition , functional capacity ( 6-minute walking distance ) spontaneous physical activity , 15 session ( 3 week ) 30 session ( 6 week ) train program . Evaluation dose-response m-NMES training term arterial stiffness functional capacity . Expected outcome : Acute change arterial stiffness and/or endothelial function expect one m-NMES session and/or c-NMES session . M-NMES session expect induce high change c-NMES stimulation session cardiovascular muscle parameter . Chronic change arterial stiffness and/or endothelial function expect 6 week m-NMES training .</detailed_description>
