	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether low-level laser therapy improve hearing threshold individual hear loss . Subjects randomly assign treatment , placebo , control group . The treatment group give three treatment low-level laser therapy , consist shin low-level laser beam onto ear head . The laser beam cool touch , cause discomfort . Each laser treatment last approximately 4 minute . Three treatment apply three time within course one week . Hearing test administer immediately treatment , immediately treatment , six week treatment . Results analyze determine effect laser treatment hearing .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Low-level laser therapy practice 20 year Europe begin practice US . Theoretically , laser energy red near infrared light spectrum capable penetrate 2-5 cm tissue stimulate mitochondrion cell produce energy ( production adenosine triphosphate ) , turn may help prevent repair tissue damage . The effect low-level laser therapy hear well study . It suggest laser therapy might help repair damage cochlea restore degree hearing loss . Studies low-level laser stimulation cochlea utilize microscopy , PET imaging , MRI suggest potential therapeutic benefit hearing . While preliminary study suggest possible improvement hearing threshold , carefully control study need verify result use valid battery audiological test .</detailed_description>
