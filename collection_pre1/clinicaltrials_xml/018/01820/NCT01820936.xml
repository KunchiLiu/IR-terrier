There approximately 52 ( least 25 % woman ) participant ( 11 sequence 4-way crossover 8 optional cohort ) . A screening phase follow open-label treatment phase consist 4 single-dose treatment period 420 mg PCI-32765 administer without food . Doses successive open-label treatment period separate washout period 7 day . Participants confine study center Day -1 treatment period ( least 10 hour study drug administration ) completion 72 hour pharmacokinetic blood sample collection Day 4 Period 4 . Blood sample pharmacokinetic analysis PCI-32765 metabolite PCI-45227 collect dose 72 hour dose treatment period . A follow-up visit approximately 10 day last dose make measure lymphocyte count capture additional adverse event . After completion 4-way crossover portion study , absence significant safety observation 420 mg PCI-32765 dose , additional separate cohort 8 participant may enrol participate one treatment period receive dose 840 mg combination high-fat breakfast .
