	<brief_summary>All trauma patient admit certain Intensive Care Units ( ICU ) Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) nasal swab perform determine MRSA colonization status . Only patient determine colonized MRSA admission include study . All patient must age 18 old , admit directly ICU either Emergency Department operate room trauma-related injury , must active recent know history MRSA infection . Once patient determine colonized MRSA , randomize receive `` decolonization '' treatment placebo . `` Decolonization '' treatment include Chlorhexidine bath Mupirocin ointment nares 5 day placebo entail `` routine '' soap bath Lubricating Jelly . Both group keep standard contact precaution throughout course study . Repeat nasal swab perform completion treatment regimen determine efficacy . Patients screen invasive MRSA infection dictate clinical course . The primary outcome measure invasive MRSA infection rate ( pneumonia , urinary tract infection , bacteremia soft tissue infection ) . Secondary endpoint include hospital length stay , ICU lengths stay , mechanical ventilatory support requirement , colonization status end treatment , death rate . As determined power analysis , aim enroll 75 patient arm course 12-24 month .</brief_summary>
