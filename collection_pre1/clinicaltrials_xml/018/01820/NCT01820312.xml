	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine low-dose radiation therapy chemotherapy drug paclitaxel effective treat head neck cancer return treatment standard radiation therapy alone , remove surgery . The overall total dose receive chemotherapy radiation therapy less typically give standard care ; however , Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) evaluate safety effectiveness combination therapy . In addition , study gather information effect radiation therapy chemotherapy subject 's overall quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Evaluate Low-Dose Fractionated Radiotherapy ( LDFRT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluate combination therapy paclitaxel LDFRT . The paclitaxel commercially available drug product dispense licensed pharmacist UAMS . Radiotherapy deliver use either TomoTherapy Treatment System ( TomoTherapy , Inc. ) Varian High Energy Linear Accelerator ( Varian Medical Systems ) . Subjects undergo CT imaging ( include neck , chest , abdomen pelvis ) part standard care approximately 7 21 day prior initiation therapy . Additional CT image do UAMS approximately 3 month completion protocol therapy every 3 month subsequently progression completion study whichever come first . These CT imaging 's obtain recurrent tumor evaluation determination presence absence distant metastasis , part standard care .</detailed_description>
