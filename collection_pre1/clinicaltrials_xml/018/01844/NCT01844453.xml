	<brief_summary>The application in-vitro fertilization ( IVF ) provide remarkable opportunity infertile couple conceive last four decade . Historically IVF perform patient bilateral tubal obstruction , use presently widespread . Although efficacy assist reproductive technology continue improve , endometrial implantation remain limiting step towards successful pregnancy . Reduced endometrial receptivity embryonic defect probable primary cause implantation failure IVF ( 1 ) . Patients repeat implantation failure despite transfer good-quality embryo continue major dilemma clinician topic great research interest . Barash et al . unintentionally discover initially report endometrial biopsy prior IVF woman one implantation failure associate increase clinical pregnancy ( 66.7 % vs 30.3 % , p &lt; 0.01 ) live birth rate 48.9 % vs 22.5 % , p=0.02 ) compare control group ( 2 ) . The mechanism local endometrial injury ( LEI ) may increase pregnancy rate still fully clear . Possible etiology include role promote beneficial local inflammatory response , induce endometrial decidualization , improve endometrial maturation synchrony ( 3-6 ) . Following Barash et al 's publication , several randomize controlled study confirm finding ( 7-11 ) . However , extensive heterogeneity among study , include number biopsy , biopsy perform select patient population . On hand study common endometrial biopsy perform prior start IVF cycle . The optimal timing endometrial biopsy respect IVF cycle unknown . There reason suspect endometrial biopsy follicular phase IVF stimulation cycle may improve pregnancy outcomes , although directly examine . We therefore propose randomize control study evaluate impact endometrial biopsy implantation pregnancy rate luteal phase prior IVF cycle well follicular phase concurrent IVF cycle .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>HYPOTHESIS 1 . Local endometrial injury improve implantation pregnancy rate 2 . Specifically , local endometrial injury follicular phase IVF cycle improve implantation pregnancy rate comparison luteal phase prior ovarian stimulation . OBJECTIVES Primary objective •To determine impact local endometrial injury implantation rate patient undergo fresh IVF cycle . Secondary objective - To determine impact local endometrial injury pregnancy outcome ( biochemical pregnancy rate , clinical pregnancy rate , miscarriage rate live birth rate ) patient undergo fresh IVF cycle . - To determine optimal time local endometrial injury ( mid-luteal phase prior ovarian stimulation early follicular phase ovarian stimulation ) improve pregnancy outcomes . - To determine correlation endometrial biopsy pathology IVF pregnancy outcome among patient randomize local endometrial injury . STUDY DESIGN The study randomize control study ( RCT ) consist patient undergoing fertility treatment second fresh IVF cycle , include ovarian stimulation gonadotropin hormone ( `` microdose flare protocol '' ) , oocyte collection procedure single embryo transfer . The patient population randomize use computer-generated random table three arm : - Luteal Phase Arm : LEI mid-luteal phase ( day 21-26 ) prior treatment cycle . - Proliferative Phase Arm : LEI early proliferative phase current treatment cycle ( day 2-3 ) . - Control Arm : No LEI perform . Patients undergo routine fresh IVF treatment cycle . Other local endometrial injury , patient receive treatment follow care per standard practice clinic . All patient study undergo `` microdose flare protocol '' fresh IVF cycle . As part protocol patient take oral contraception pill month duration prior start IVF cycle . Therefore possibility undocumented pregnancy time LEI luteal phase minimize . The LEI perform use standard technique use Pipelle sample catheter outpatient department . After speculum examination perform cervix well visualize , Pipelle insert gently cervical canal uterine cavity advance slowly resistance note . At point internal piston withdrawn create negative suction Pipelle gently maneuver alongside uterine cavity wall . The Pipelle catheter withdrawn gently obtain specimen ( uterine lining ) send histopathological examination . Both embryologist prepares embryo physician transfer embryo directly aware study arm patient allocate . However procedure perform clinic , include LEI , document patient chart therefore accessible . As per routine practice clinic , pregnancy test perform quantitative serum beta-hCG level 12 day embryo transfer . A clinical pregnancy confirm use transvaginal ultrasound 2 week positive pregnancy test ( serum BHCG ) .</detailed_description>
