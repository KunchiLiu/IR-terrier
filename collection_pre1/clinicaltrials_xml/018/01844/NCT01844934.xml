	<detailed_description>Recovery post Total Knee Replacement Surgery ( ( TKA ) subject interest . In study 379 patient hip knee replacement surgery , report 6 month post-surgery patient well baseline function superior functional ability less pain patient low function baseline . Another study 276 patient undergoing TKA report pre-operative joint function predictor joint function overall function 6 month post-surgery . These finding suggest prehabilitation increase functional ability prior TKA may positive effect recover post-surgery . In randomized control trial patient receive TKA , group receive Exercise Program ( prehabilitation ) make significant improvement performance baseline surgery , 1 3 month post surgery . For group receive Exercise Program pre-surgery , significant improvement occur 3 month post surgery . The overall objective propose single-blinded randomized control trial demonstrate well design prehabilitation program patient receive TKA surgery significantly improve outcomes related pain function may reduce utilization health care service post surgery . In randomized control trial hypothesize group participant receive prehabilitation Exercise Program recover quicker patient receive Exercise Program base several measure performance include pain , quadriceps strength , range motion quality life .</detailed_description>
