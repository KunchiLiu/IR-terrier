	<detailed_description>Clinical protocol OS440-3003 multicenter , open-label , non-randomized , uncontrolled , dose escalation study evaluate safety tolerability Arbaclofen Extended Release Tablets ( AERT ) 1 year MS subject spasticity . All subject study receive arbaclofen extend release tablet formulation . All subject begin treatment arbaclofen 20 milligram ( mg ) per day ( 2 X 10 mg ) two week , increase 30 mg per day ( 2 X 15 mg ) two week , increase 40 mg per day ( 2 X 20 mg ) base Dose Escalation Criteria . Once subject reach Maintenance Dose , remain dose approximately 1 year . The Maintenance Dose high tolerate dose , exceed 40 mg per day . In study , Up Titration Period begin Visit 2 end Maintenance Dose determine . The Maintenance Period time establishment Maintenance Dose down-titration visit . For subject complete study , Maintenance Period approximately 1 year duration . The Down Titration Period 2 week subject maintenance dose 40 mg per day 1 week subject maintenance dose 30 mg per day . There titration phase subject 20 mg per day maintenance dose . Subjects Maintenance Dose 20 mg per day ( i.e. , subject tolerate 30 mg/ day dose ) begin 1 year Maintenance Period Visit 4 complete study Visit 8 .
