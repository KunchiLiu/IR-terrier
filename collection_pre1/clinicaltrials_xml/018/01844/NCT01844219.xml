	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury cardiac surgery report increase morbidity mortality . Several risk score model prediction aortic kidney injury cardiac surgery develop . However , predictive accuracy model stil unclear . The aim study evaluate accuracy four pre-existing prediction model ( AKICS , Wijeysundera , Mehta , Thakar model ) use gray zone approach patient underwent aortic surgery institution . Based receiver operate characteristic ( ROC ) curve analysis , construct gray zone use cut-off value sensitivity &lt; 90 % , specificity &lt; 90 % ( diagnostic tolerance 10 % ) .</detailed_description>
