	<brief_summary>Purpose study evaluate , implantation drug elute stent ( DES ) , coverage stent strut new tissue . The evaluation perform mean intravascular image technology ( optical frequency domain imaging , OFDI ) . Renewed tissue coverage implant stent strut prevents direct contact blood metal/polymer , could lead adverse event : patient need take blood-thinning drug prevent event . Ous new stent drug polymer outside stent , polymer degrade body leave bare metal stent 3-4 month . This allow fast coverage strut , might allow reduce duration supportive medical treatment . Our hypothesis &lt; 20 % strut remain uncovered 3 month implantation , assess OFDI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Optical Frequency Domain Imaging ( OFDI ) Assessed Strut Coverage New Terumo DES</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We enroll patient multiple coronary lesion , , routine practice , treat new DES 2 session ( second one approximately 3-5 week first one ) . We assess lesion OFDI implantation time 3 month follow-up , ask patient undergo coronary angiography . Patients follow-up contact 1 year initial implantation .</detailed_description>
