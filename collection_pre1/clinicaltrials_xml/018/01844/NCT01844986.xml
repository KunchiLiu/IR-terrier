	<criteria>Female patient newly diagnose , histologically confirm , high risk advance ( FIGO stage III IV ) BRCA mutate high grade serous high grade endometrioid ovarian cancer , primary peritoneal cancer / fallopiantube cancer complete first line platinum base chemotherapy ( intravenous intraperitoneal ) . Stage III patient must one attempt optimal debulking surgery ( upfront interval debulking ) . Stage IV patient must either biopsy and/or upfront interval debulking surgery . Documented mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 predict deleterious suspect deleterious ( know predict detrimental/lead loss function ) . Patients complete first line platinum ( e.g . carboplatin cisplatin ) , contain therapy ( intravenous intraperitoneal ) prior randomisation : Patients must , opinion investigator , clinical complete response partial response clinical evidence disease progression post treatment scan rise CA125 level , follow completion chemotherapy course . Patients stable disease posttreatment scan completion first line platinumcontaining therapy eligible study . Patients must randomize within 8 week last dose chemotherapy BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutation consider non detrimental ( e.g . `` Variants uncertain clinical significance '' `` Variant unknown significance '' `` Variant , favor polymorphism '' `` benign polymorphism '' etc ) . Patients early stage disease ( FIGO Stage I , IIA , IIB IIC ) Stable disease progressive disease posttreatment scan clinical evidence progression end patient 's first line chemotherapy treatment . Patients one debulking surgery perform randomisation study . ( Patients , time diagnosis , deem unresectable undergo biopsy oophorectomy go receive chemotherapy interval debulking surgery eligible ) . Patients previously diagnose treat earlier stage ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer . Patients previously receive chemotherapy abdominal pelvic tumour , include treatment prior diagnosis earlier stage ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer . ( Patients receive prior adjuvant chemotherapy localise breast cancer may eligible , provide complete three year prior registration , patient remain free recurrent metastatic disease ) .
