Patients 10 day less lifetime antipsychotic exposure clinical need antipsychotic treatment pediatric psychiatric disorder FDA indication antipsychotic use , i.e. , bipolar mania , schizophrenia-spectrum disorder , irritability associate autistic disorder . In addition , also include youth fulfilling research diagnostic criterion severe mood dysregulation ( SMD ) . Randomization stratify high vs. low genetic risk antipsychotic-induced weight gain base MC4R genotype primary outcome weight change baseline endpoint ZIP UC antipsychotic treatment two genotype group . As detailed , metabolic cardiac safety parameter also measure compare across treatment genotype group .</brief_summary>
