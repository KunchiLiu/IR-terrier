	<detailed_description>Device Description : The Dynamic Foot Orthosis ( DFO ) design roll link mechanism distal 3rd . It design reduce slide friction torque metatarsal head addition decrease compressive force accomplish conventional multi-durometer FOs . The relative sliding motion two compliant surface allow deformation horizontally lower frictional resistance . The DFO address friction element accommodate normal slide roll motion distal 3rd foot gait . Additionally , DFO silicone layer metatarsal head remainder anterior section make 2 separated orthotic layer slide . This provide articulate surface provide relative motion orthotic segment transmit load . Study Objectives : In pilot study , first objective bench test novel shear reduce insole compare current standard insole shoe . The second objective study twenty-seven insensate diabetes patient pre-ulcerative foot callus examine change spatial temporal gait include gait initiation , risk fall , static dynamic balance , plantar temperature response walk consecutive plantar stress footwear condition . Study Design : This interventional study . For objective one , change compression stiffness static coefficient friction measure use force dynamometer lab Professor Albert Shih . A test platform build evaluate performance shear reduction shoe sole design characteristic force , two direction parallel ( shear ) perpendicular ground , associate deformation steady-state impulse condition . For objective two , diabetes patient present Michigan Orthotics Prosthetics Center fabrication dispense diabetic shoe innersole invited participate . Twenty-seven insensate diabetes patient pre-ulcerative foot callus enrol . Patients wear body worn sensor ( LegSys ) measure change spatial-temporal gait static dynamic balance parameter prior post usage insole . To reduce effect learn naïve use novel footwear , test sequence experimental standard footwear randomize . We examine increase foot temperature 200 step continuous walk use DFO use standard insole . We also examine thermal change mediate autonomic neuropathy measure sudomotor function . The footwear test sequence randomize acclimatization procedure follow effort minimize potential effect cumulative plantar temperature responses walk footwear condition . We also examine static balance measure center mass eye open eye close condition . Outcome Measures : For objective one , primary endpoint compression stiffness static coefficient friction . For objective two , plantar foot temperature change regions-of-interest response walk 200 step measure footwear condition compare baseline . Other outcome measure include gait analysis , include gait initiation , gait speed , double support time , medial lateral center mass displacement , inter-cycle variability single dual task condition . This measure footwear condition . Static balance also measure footwear condition . Using Romberg 's test , also assess center mass displacement reciprocal hip ankle motion eye open close condition . Sudomotor function measure electrical sweat conductance ( ESC ) , express microSiemens ( µS ) . Safety Evaluation : All subject sign inform consent form determine eligible treatment include analysis safety . Collection , classification summary analysis adverse event perform . Duration Participation : One visit last approximately 1 hour . Duration Study : One year Inclusion Criteria : Patients include diabetes refer diabetic shoe . They also insensate pre-ulcerative plantar callus previous plantar foot ulcer . Exclusion Criteria : Patients exclude unable independently walk 100 foot , low extremity prosthesis user , active cellulitis , foot ulcer , Charcot foot .</detailed_description>
