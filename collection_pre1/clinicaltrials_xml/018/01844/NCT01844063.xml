	<brief_summary>HBV-related liver failure ( HBV-LF ) , dramatic clinical syndrome , characterize massive necrosis liver cell . Liver transplantation might effective therapy HBV-LF . However , lot problem lack donor , surgical complication , transplant rejection , high cost , could limit application liver transplantation . It demonstrate mesenchymal stem cell could directionally differentiate hepatocytes cholangiocytes injure liver , well reduce inflammation liver immune regulation . In study , assess safety efficacy human bone marrow umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell transplantation patient HBV-LF .</brief_summary>
