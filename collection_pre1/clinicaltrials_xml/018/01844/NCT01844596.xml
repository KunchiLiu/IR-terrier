	<detailed_description>Hypertension awareness , treatment , control rate low region world . A critical component hypertension management facilitate sustain access affect individual effective clinical service . In partnership Government Kenya , Academic Model Providing Access Healthcare ( AMPATH ) Partnership expand clinical scope work rural western Kenya include hypertension chronic disease . However , link retain individual elevate blood pressure clinical care program difficult . To address challenge , propose develop evaluate innovative community-based strategy initiative support mobile technology . The objective application utilize multi-disciplinary implementation research approach address challenge link retain hypertensive individual hypertension management program . The central hypothesis : community health worker ( CHWs ) , equip tailored behavioral communication strategy smartphone-based tool link electronic health record , increase linkage retention hypertensive individual hypertension care program thereby significantly reduce blood pressure among patient . We hypothesize intervention cost-effective . This research generate innovative productive solution expand global problem hypertension , add exist knowledge scalable sustainable strategy effectively manage hypertension chronic diseases low- middle-income country .</detailed_description>
