	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare overall survival patient previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer receive gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel plus OGX-427 gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel plus placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Of Gemcitabine Plus Nab-Paclitaxel +/- OGX-427 In Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients pancreatic cancer usually present inoperable disease systemic therapy become primary form treatment . The combination gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel represent appropriate front-line standard care patient metastatic pancreatic cancer . However , poor outcome disease warrant exploration novel drug unique mechanisms action . Preclinical evidence suggest OGX-427 show promising activity pancreatic cancer . In trial , compare overall survival patient previously untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer use OGX-427 either gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel placebo gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel .</detailed_description>
