Abdominal pain flank pain ( without rebound tenderness ) , pain caused cIAI refer another anatomic area 5 . Able provide inform consent 6 . If male : must agree use effective barrier method contraception study 90 day follow last dose sexually active female childbearing potential 7 . If female , pregnant nursing , childbearing potential : either commit use least two medically accept , effective method birth control ( example , condom , oral contraceptive , indwell intrauterine device , hormonal implant /patch , injection , approve cervical ring ) study drug dose 90 day follow last study drug dose practice sexual abstinence 1 . Unlikely survive 68 week study period 2 . Renal failure 3 . Presence possible sign hepatic disease 4 . Immunocompromised condition , include know human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) positivity ( require antiretroviral therapy CD4 count &lt; 300 ) , acquire immune deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) , organ ( bone marrow ) transplant recipient , hematological malignancy .

Participation investigational drug device study within 30 day prior study entry 7 . Known suspected current Central Nervous System disorder may predispose seizure low seizure threshold 8 . Previously receive eravacycline clinical trial 9 . Antibioticrelated exclusion : 1 . Receipt effective antibacterial drug therapy cIAI continuous duration &gt; 24 hour 72hour precede enrollment ( however , participant document cIAI [ , know baseline pathogen ] receive least 72 hour antibiotic therapy consider treatment failure may enrol . Treatment failure define persistent fever and/or clinical symptom ; development new intraabdominal abscess ≥72 hour antibiotic therapy ) , 2 . Receipt ertapenem carbapenem , tigecycline current infection 3 . Need concomitant systemic antimicrobial agent study drug 10 .
