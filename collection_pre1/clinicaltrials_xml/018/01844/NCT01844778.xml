	<brief_summary>The purpose interventional Phase IV study explore ease use TIP prevalence microbial contamination T-326 Inhaler compare TIS colistimethate administer via nebuliser treatment Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) patient chronically infect P. aeruginosa . It anticipate data study would provide clinician guidance relative difference speed ease use treatment well useful information prevalence microbial contamination inhalation device `` real world '' use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ease Use Microbial Contamination Tobramycin Inhalation Powder ( TIP ) Versus Nebulised Tobramycin Inhalation Solution ( TIS ) Nebulised Colistimethate ( COLI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients colistimethate ( COLI ) , Tobramycin Inhalation Powder ( TIP ) Tobramycin Inhalation Solution ( TIS ) recruit study . They go one treatment cycle usual inhaled antibiotic treatment , transfer TIP second treatment cycle . The primary endpoint total administration time TIP v TIS v colistimethate , define total time take prepare delivery device drug , administer drug , clean disinfect delivery device .</detailed_description>
