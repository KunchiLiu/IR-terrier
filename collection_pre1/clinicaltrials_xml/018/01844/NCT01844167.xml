	<brief_title>The Effect Noxipoint Therapy Versus Physical Therapy With TENS Chronic Neck Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose To compare effect Noxipoint™ Therapy physical therapy subject chronic neck pain . Background There many intervention manage chronic neck pain . The approach include physical therapy , medication local corticoid injection , physical therapy ( PT ) prevalent treatment . Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) one regular treatment PT usually use chronic neck pain adjunct therapy . However , application TENS , include location , duration intensity stimulation , loosely define largely decided physical therapist thus vary substantially one application another . In spite long history TENS use , result exist study , include randomize controlled trial ( RCTs ) , inconclusive , show benefit TENS , others show none . Moreover , study cite positive effect TENS placebo also find effect last long run . The conclusion could draw TENS sometimes relieve pain short term . Noxipoint™ Therapy , particular combination precise location , intensity duration electrical stimulation , invent Charles Koo , Co-PI protocol , may relieve general muscular-skeletal pain recover muscle function permanently . Based observation clinical application Noxipoint Therapy neck shoulder pain , Noxipoint Therapy show rapid relief last effect several month treatment . However , large-scale randomize control study available yet . The key point Noxipoint Therapy location stimulation determine factor efficacy pain treatment . In addition , intensity , wave pattern duration stimulation also play important role . The patient 's compliance instruction avoid stress newly recover muscle/tissue `` rest period '' also mandatory . The purpose study compare effect Noxipoint Therapy physical therapy patient chronic neck pain . Study design 1 . Prospective , patient- assessor-blinded , stratified , randomize control trial . Stratification factor patient-reported primary measure ( pain scale ) describe . Patients assign two tier randomization . 2 . Outcome measure : ( 1 ) pain scale measure Brief Pain Index ( BPI ) 0 to10 ( 2 ) cervical Range Motion ( ROM ) , ( 3 ) Quality Life ( QoL ) use BPI Interference Function , ( 4 ) ultrasound elastogram . The primary outcome BPI-at-its-Worst . Cervical ROM use measure functional restoration , BPI Interference Functions use measure quality life , elastogram use evaluate myofascial condition . Subject enrollment 1 . Subject 's inclusion criterion : ( 1 ) 20 70 year age , ( 2 ) diagnose chronic cervical pain syndrome ( ICD9 : 723.1 ) ( 3 ) less 6 month pain history , ( 4 ) pain level &gt; ＝ 5 BPI ( 5 ) trigger point . 2 . Subject 's exclusion criterion : ( 1 ) cervical spondylosis , ( 2 ) local corticoid injection within last two week , ( 3 ) sign psychosomatic illness , ( 4 ) unwilling randomize , ( 5 ) pregnant woman . 3.80 subject recruit Rehabilitation Department Physical Therapy Department National Taiwan University Hospital ( NTUH ) . After initial evaluation , qualified subject stratify randomize follow two arm , 40 subject either arm : 1 . Physical Therapy group ( PT ) 2 . Noxipoint Therapy group ( NT ) Methods 1 . Intervention : 1 . Physical therapy arm ( PT ) : - The TENS device use : FDA K071951 - Patients treated standard physical therapy , include electrical stimulation . Manual therapy , cold/heat therapy exercise apply discretion physical therapist 60 minute session . Patient education self-care instruction provide . TENS also perform session 30 minute base typical PT guideline , serve part standard care placebo equivalent . It typically set Normal mode 120 Hertz rate . 2 . Noxipoint Therapy arm ( NT ) : Patients treat electrical stimulation follow Noxipoint Therapy guideline highlight : - The TENS device use PT . Each calibrate allow maximum range specification . - The pair electrode pad place skin surface location correspond pair Noxipoints injure muscle/soft tissue , 2- 5 minute application electrical stimulation . - The electrical stimulation set induce C-fiber response ( i.e. , dull pain , soreness , achiness ) base feedback patient stimulation . - If correspond pain eliminate least reduced couple application correct Noxipoints , apply ice pack 10-15 minute site next Noxipoint stimulation alleviate excessive inflammation . - For severe chronic neck pain patient , cervical brace recommend within first 2-3 day treatment session . The patient avoid use treated tissues/muscles `` Rest Period '' : Similar cell , muscle cell heal regeneration take time . Patients instructed use newly recover muscle/tissue `` Rest Period '' , three day forty young , plus one extra day every 10 additional year age . If patient extensive injured muscle , take two day rest . Ice pack may use soon session prevent Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness ( DOMS ) TENS stimulation . - Placebo effect consideration : TENS include arm obfuscate process . Using TENS PT arm serve sham-therapy-equivalent use NT arm neutralize placebo bias , meaningful therapeutic remedy . The subject thus blind . Placebo effect consideration : TENS include arm obfuscate process . Using TENS PT arm serve sham-therapy-equivalent use NT arm neutralize placebo bias , meaningful therapeutic remedy . The subject thus blind . 3 . Subjects either group treat 6 session within 3 week , 1.5 hour per session . The treatment terminate six session earlier patient show symptom . No additional treatment provide 6 session . 2 . Evaluation : Pain scale , ROM QoL measure first treatment 4 week 8 week first treatment . Pain scale QoL may measure session , 12 week ( phone ) first treatment . Elastogram take first treatment 4 week first treatment . See attached Time Table end . 3 . Statistics : The effect PT NT compare base two-sample hypothesis test method . The significant level set 0.05 . All estimate P-values two tail . Missing data treat use Last Observation Carried Forward ( LOCF ) method . 4 . Safety : Noxipoint Therapy safe TENS application , since use within general guideline TENS . 5 . Patient Data Security Measure : The principle investigator monitor data safety measure , keep study data separately medical data . The mapping table subject 's identity randomly assign identity maintain separately . 6 . Compensation : Each subject compensate NT $ 400 time/transportation cost ; half treatment half follow-up . Dropout subject pay pro rata .</detailed_description>
