	<brief_summary>Postoperative ileus remain significant medical problem colorectal surgery adversely influence patient ' recovery . The investigator previous study demonstrate electroacupuncture ( EA ) Zusanli , Sanyinjiao , Hegu , Zhigou reduce duration postoperative ileus hospital stay laparoscopic resection colonic upper rectal cancer . Patients mid/low rectal cancer undergo laparoscopic total mesorectal excision ( TME ) abdominoperineal resection ( APR ) exclude . However , complex case likely develop prolong ileus morbidity surgery , uncertain whether EA beneficial . The investigator therefore propose conduct prospective cohort study evaluate efficacy EA prevent prolonged ileus laparoscopic surgery mid/low rectal cancer . Fifty consecutive patient mid/low rectal cancer undergo laparoscopic TME APR without need conversion recruit . All patient undergo 1 session ( 20 minute ) EA daily postoperative day 1 till day 4 . These patient compare matched historical control group ( 1:2 ) underwent laparoscopic TME APR without EA . The primary outcome incidence prolong ileus , define inability tolerate fluid diet 4 day surgery , associate need nasogastric decompression and/or parenteral nutrition support . Secondary outcome include time defecation duration hospital stay . Results study help clarify efficacy EA prevent prolonged ileus laparoscopic rectal surgery , may provide basis planning large randomize control trial .</brief_summary>
