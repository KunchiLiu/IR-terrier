	<brief_title>Quinacrine-Capecitabine Combinatorial Therapy Advanced Stage Colorectal ADenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Because well publish safety profile quinacrine capecitabine , Phase I portion study aim determine tolerability agent combination use establish clinical dos . This portion study closely resemble pilot study feasibility study rather dose escalation Phase I trial . The objective determine toxicity adverse reaction , maximally tolerate dose . The investigator hypothesize toxic interaction pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic level , want know feasibility use quinacrine capecitabine respective recommend single agent dos . Because capecitabine already regarded standard treatment colorectal cancer , investigator begin study full dose capecitabine combine slightly low dose quinacrine . If safety-interim analysis detect excess toxicity , subsequent patient enrol use full dose drug .</detailed_description>
