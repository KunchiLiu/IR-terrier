	<brief_summary>This study examine effect , , use muscle stimulation quadriceps follow total knee replacement . Secondary objective evaluate compare pain level , qualitative outcome , impact NMES pain medication request group . It possible strengthen quadriceps muscle improve activation reduce postoperative pain help patient return activity sooner standard therapy alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Postoperative Compex Rehab NMES Use Total Knee Arthroplasty Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) muscle strengthen training use since 1970s , question still remain regard effectiveness different patient population , duration use specific regard stimulation , length type electrical impulse . NMES work pass electrical impulse muscle get contract . These impulse mimic body 's natural neural activity ( action potential ) cause contraction . The goal NMES strengthen muscle sooner use muscle re-education . The quadriceps weaken sometimes slow respond knee surgery . A weak quadriceps muscle surgery contribute factor dissatisfaction surgical result . When quadriceps weak fire properly , force transfer area knee joint place additional strain replace joint contribute knee pain , swell inflammation . If get patient ' quad fire well sooner , hope would also see good short-term long-term functional outcome long-term satisfaction presently report . Study Enrollment We look 60 patient participate . We randomly assign 30 participant receive standard therapy regimen 30 follow standard therapy regimen addition use NMES treatment twice day , every day , ten-week period . Patients therapy NMES treatment group keep track log use home turn unit 10-week appointment . The unit easy use participant give specific instruction use . All participant complete baseline muscle test surgery two-week , six-week , ten-week , one-year appointment . The muscle test consist battery functional measure assess quadriceps Timed Up Go test ( TUG ) , Six Minute Walk test ( 6MWT ) , Single Limb Stance ( SLS ) others . All test conduct Indiana Orthopaedic Hospital South 's physical therapy department . When design study work closely department make sure intend test appropriate study facility ; input staff continue integral study 's success . It early report finding still enrol patient . If effective , NMES treatment improve quadriceps activation function early surgery , hopefully allow patient experience less pain quicker functional recovery patient use NMES . Only time tell logical conclusion NMES standard postoperative therapy would beneficial patient . We anxiously await outcome study .</detailed_description>
