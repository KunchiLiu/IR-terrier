	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common cause cardioembolism lead cause ischemic stroke . The diagnosis AF cerebral ischemia difficult establish even treatment specialise stroke unit , paroxysmal episode may terminate spontaneously arrival hospital always show early recurrence . However , diagnosis AF particular clinical relevance since adaequate anticoagulation one effective secondary preventive treatment stroke . The detection rate AF stroke increase progressively extend duration intensity cardiac monitoring . For purpose innovative medical device implantable event recorder suggest . However , high socioeconomic expense , malcompliance invasiveness approach currently limit use minority affect patient , grow number stroke survivor lack access free simple screening tool . For primary prevention , measurement peripheral pulse ( MPP ) currently guideline-recommended screen method among individual age 65 year old . In contrast , MPP never apply set secondary stroke prevention , probably several factor expect interfere simple technique , include sensomotor neuropsychiologic handicap stroke patient 18 . This study investigate feasibility validity MPP cohort ( pilot phase ) compare daily MPP 6 month repeat holter-ECG patient ischemic stroke .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , single-center , observational trial enroll n=300 patient acute cerebral ischemia without detection AF standard stroke unit diagnostic procedure . During acute in-hospital phase stroke unit , patient , available , relative introduce trained peripheral pulse self measurement . Experiences educational process , include feasibility diagnostic accuracy already gain pilot phase study ( n=256 patient ) . Pulse rate subjective perception absolute pulse arrhythmia assess patient and/or relative least three time daily palpitation , result document patient diary . After hospital discharge , patient continue daily measurement ( min . 3 time per day ) 6 month . In parallel patient transmit ECGs use handheld mobile ECG-device control study center . This ECG review episode atrial fibrillation . If patient recognize new pulse arrhythmia excess pulse rate beyond upper low limit &gt; 120/min &lt; 45/min , resp. , patient request transmit additional ECG study center . In case , 12-lead ECG diagnostic test ( e.g . cardiac marker echocardiography ) initiate . As internal control group patient receive standard 72h holter ECG 3 6 month evaluate episode atrial fibrillation investigator blind clinical data well result pulse measurement . Detection rate ( pulse measurement , holter ECGs ) well time first diagnosis atrial fibrillation use different diagnostic approach important endpoint study .</detailed_description>
