	<detailed_description>Studies C1056 C1057 follow similar protocol , nearly identical design , common inclusion exclusion criterion , conducted time period . Nevertheless , give heterogeneous presentation SLE disease fact Phase III program run globally , variation patient population , within study ( e.g. , different centre ) study ( analogous difference centre within study ) expect . Since establish conduct study effectively , must determine whether relative treatment effect different one study compare study evaluate whether two study similar enough pool . Each Phase III study achieve statistical significance belimumab 10 mg/kg pre-specified primary endpoint SRI response Week 52 ; therefore , nearly identical study provide independent replication result . While pool necessary establish effectiveness belimumab , consider appropriate order evaluate treatment effect high disease activity subgroup interest , give individual study design provide sufficient power demonstrate effectiveness within subgroup . Thus , statistical evaluation pool study test treatment-by-study interaction undertaken . A significant treatment-by-study interaction would indicate relative treatment difference statistically different two study pool would justify . Conversely , lack treatment-by-study interaction would indicate study result similar treatment response pool would justify . When two Phase III study pool SRI analysis , treatment-by-study interaction &gt; 0.5 . Likewise , target population high disease activity , treatment-by-study interaction &gt; 0.7 suggest high disease activity subgroup may homogenous therefore similar treatment effect study population whole . Given consideration , reasonable valid pool two study allow good precision evaluation subgroup .</detailed_description>
