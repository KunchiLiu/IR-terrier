	<brief_summary>Gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM ) common complication pregnancy . Both mother offspring significantly increase future risk metabolic cardiovascular disease consequence GDM . Pathological insulin resistance pancreatic β-cell dysfunction may contribute development adverse outcome GDM . Recently , fibroblast growth factor 19 ( FGF19 ) FGF21 emerge key endocrine regulator glucose , lipid energy metabolism . Both factor activate FGFRs context co-receptor βKlotho ( KLB ) expression . After , proteins alter ERK phosphorylation stimulate glucose uptake . Furthermore , two factor ameliorate insulin resistance various way include up-regulating insulin mRNA , IRS-1 , GLUT-1 expression , down-regulating GH-IGF-1 level different tissue blood circulation also improve dyslipidemia . Our previous study show several factor involve insulin resistance FGF19/FGF21 signal pathway differential expression placenta GDM normal glucose tolerance pregnancy . Those lead u hypothesize FGF19/FGF21 signal pathway could play important role pathogenesis development insulin resistance state GDM . In present study , investigate whether maternal neonatal FGF19/FGF21 signal pathway alter associate insulin resistance , glucose intolerance , dyslipidemia adverse pregnancy outcome . Thus evaluate regulate action FGF19/FGF21 gestational insulin resistance . The aim study elucidate role FGF19/FGF21 insulin resistance metabolic disorder GDM .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>First，30 pregnant woman GDM 60 pregnant control woman normal glucose tolerance ( NGT ) match maternal gestational age enrol study . All subject underwent antepartum screen First Affiliated Hospital Sun Yat-sen University . Blood sample obtain overnight fasting time oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) . Serum FGF19 FGF21 level determine enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) correlate anthropometric , metabolic , endocrine parameter . Homeostasis model assessment ( HOMA-IR ) index calculate analyse . Second , sample measurement obtain 30 woman GDM 35 healthy pregnant control undergo caesarean section term . mRNA protein expression level FGF19/FGF21 co-receptor βKlotho（KLB）in placenta , rectus muscle subcutaneous fat tissue investigate real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( qRT-PCR ) , western-blot immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) , respectively . Clinical data collect analysed . Data analyze SPSS 20.0 database . The result express mean ± standard deviation median interquartile range . Differences group assess Student 's unpaired test , Mann-Whitney U test , Chi-square test appropriate . Correlation analysis perform use Spearman rank correlation method . To identify independent relationship adjust effect covariates , multiple linear regression analysis perform . P value &lt; 0.05 consider significant .</detailed_description>
