	<brief_summary>This project aim understand molecular biology underlie improvement surgical scar treat ablative fractional photothermolysis ( FP ) . Previous human study MGH show FP significantly improve appearance functionality surgical burn scar . At Wellman Center , conduct randomized , control study linear surgical scar demonstrate efficacy FP decrease volume hypertrophic scar , improve appearance texture scar . However , underlie mechanism therapeutic effect unknown . It clear FP induces wind heal remodel normal skin surround microthermal zone ( MTZs ) . Furthermore , researcher employ animal model use transgenic zebrafish mouse eye , find laser treatment induce change gene expression specific cell . We propose determine whether effect FP scar improvement occur via change pattern local gene expression within skin , specifically dermal fibroblast . By characterize change , may able identify molecular mechanism explain contribute beneficial effect FP surgical traumatic scar . The molecular insight therapeutic effect fractional laser photothermolysis may provide basis future therapeutic strategy improve scar remodeling .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gene Expression During Surgical Scar Remodeling Fractional Photothermolysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A prospective , open-label study 10 healthy adult , age 18-50 , abdominal scar pursue Clinical Research Unit Wellman Center Photomedicine ( MGH ) . A side-by-side comparison untreated vs. one topical treatment ablative fractional photothermolysis qualify subject make . Ten subject receive treatment randomly-assigned portion scar , addition non-treated control sit . The primary measure efficacy ( ) blind evaluation scar improvement standard digital photograph take treatment , ( b ) change scar volume ( measured 3D Image system ) and/or scar width , ( c ) quantitative characterization gene expression measure mRNA expression level treat untreated scar control sit . The primary measure side effect inflammatory pigmentary outcome assess blind evaluation digital photograph take treatment . Another study endpoint include histopathological examination comparison treat untreated scar . An FDA-approved 10600 nm Fractional laser source use laser exposure perform 2 month prior 2 skin biopsy ( 24 mm x 4 mm ) treat untreated scar site . A control site , treatment also leave clinical , histological molecular examination .</detailed_description>
