	<brief_summary>A natural form vitamin E call tocotrienol ( TCT ) blood thin cholesterol lower property , may benefit stroke survivor . This study conduct determine blood thin cholesterol lower property TCT stroke TIA ( transient ischemic attack , also refer `` mini-stroke '' ) survivor receive standard treatment prevention recurrent stroke . Study Hypothesis : Oral TCT decrease incidence aspirin clopidogrel nonresponders , increase extent inhibition platelet aggregation , decrease LDL without significant side effect stroke patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nutrition Blood Outcomes Following Tocotrienol N2B</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Phase IIB trial goal determine effect orally supplement TCT platelet function cholesterol well safety patient TIA ( transient ischemic attack ) stroke addition standard treatment stroke prevention . Recurrent cardiovascular event include stroke , TIA , heart attack , venous thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , systemic embolism also record . In patient recurrent stroke , severity stroke stroke size measure MR ( magnetic resonance ) CT ( compute tomography ) imaging also collect . We expect TCT inhibit blood clot low cholesterol current standard treatment without significantly increase bleed risk side effect . Future work plan large TIA/stroke population examine whether TCT add standard medical care term decrease incidence stroke improve outcomes follow stroke .</detailed_description>
