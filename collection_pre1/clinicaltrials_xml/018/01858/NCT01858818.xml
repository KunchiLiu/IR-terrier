	<brief_summary>This project aim investigate dysfunctional learn habitization affect acute alcohol exposure , whether individual difference alcohol effect predict later development Alcohol Use Disorders ( AUDs ) . Eighty 18-year-old healthy male subject test two day within-subjects design blind administration alcohol vs. placebo different behavioral learning task . The investigator investigate alcohol influence performance task , whether alcohol effect differ high- low-risk subject , whether task performance alcohol predict future AUDs .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Project 4 : Acute Effects Alcohol Learning Habitization Healthy Young Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project part large multi-center study Dresden Berlin Learning Alcohol Dependence ( LeAD ) . Project 4 aim investigate dysfunctional learn habitization affect acute alcohol exposure , whether individual difference alcohol effect predict later development AUDs . The project investigate eighty 18-year-old healthy male subject , subsample LeAD project 1 already test Dresden use fMRI ( Clinical Trials.govID : NCT01744834 ) . Participants test two day within-subjects design blind administration alcohol placebo . On 2 day participant perform three behavioral learn task measure : 1. condition money vs. drink stimulus 2. habitization vs. instrumental learn 3. approach avoidance behavior towards money drink stimulus . The investigator investigate alcohol influence performance task , whether alcohol effect differ high- low-risk subject , whether task performance alcohol predict future AUDs . Participants follow three year . The project investigate whether single dos alcohol affect conditioning monetary reward alcoholic stimulus , impair instrumental learning , enhance stimulus-response association . The investigator want test whether individual performance parameter relate risk factor AUDs , e.g . family history alcoholism impulsivity .</detailed_description>
