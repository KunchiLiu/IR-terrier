	<brief_summary>This research study Pilot Study . Pilot study conduct see practical type research ona large scale future . The pilot part study ass possibility use pencil beam proton radiation treat type cancer . Proton radiation use many type malignancy , use treatment anal cancer limit . The treatment still study research doctor try find use treatment anal cancer . Proton beam radiation therapy FDA approve radiation delivery system . You ask participate study cancer anal canal . Conventional radiation therapy photon combination 5-FU mitomycin-C use standard treatment many patient anal cancer . In research study look another type radiation call proton radiation , know spare surround tissue organ radiation . Proton radiation delivers radiation area require radiation delivers dose beyond region require treatment . There several technique use deliver proton radiation therapy . One new technique , call pencil beam scanning , allow accurate delivery radiation tumor reduce amount normal tissue expose radiation . Most proton patient treat number beam study doctor conform shape tumor . Pencil beam scan delivers radiation single , narrow proton beam sweep area tumor . This may reduce side effect patient would normally experience conventional radiation therapy mean deliver proton radiation therapy , also minimize treatment time . In research study , evaluate effectiveness use pencil beam proton radiation deliver reduce side effect associate radiation treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If agree participate study , ask undergo screening test procedure confirm eligible . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn take part research study . If test procedure recently , may may repeat . The screen include follow : medical history , physical examination , biopsy tumor , anal groin exam , archival tumor tissue , CT PET-CT , MRI , blood test serum pregnancy test . If test show eligible participate research study , begin study treatment . If meet eligibility criterion , able participate research study . Proton Radiation deliver daily 5-6 week , depend dose prescribed physician . Treatment deliver ( Monday-Friday ) 5 day ( weekend holiday ) . Each treatment require lie table 25-30 minute . You receive radiation therapy outpatient Massachusetts General Hospital . You start receive chemotherapy within 5 day start radiation treatment . The day start chemotherapy consider Day 1 . You receive Mitomycin-C Days 1 29 chemotherapy . Mitomycin-C delivered via IV infusion period 10-30 minute . You receive 5-fluorouracil Day 1 29 chemotherapy . You fit ambulatory infusion pump administer 5-FU via IV infusion continuously period 96 hour . The infusion pump size paperback book fit front-pack `` fanny-pack '' around waist . This pump connect body . The nurse infusion room start pump disconnect 4 day . At 6 12 week follow visit , physical examination test procedure receive tell study doctor whether disease gotten well , bad stay . If cancer get good , continue monitor follow visit . If cancer suspect gotten bad , need biopsy confirm . If biopsy negative , need come back re-evaluation 16 week ( 4 month ) complete radiation therapy . If biopsy confirms cancer get bad , doctor recommend surgery removal tumor . If cancer stay , doctor recommend additional procedure do develop plan treatment . After complete radiation therapy , follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
