	<brief_summary>Ocaratuzumab third-generation , fully humanize IgG1 monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) target CD20 surface marker normal malignant B lymphocytes . It optimize increase bind CD20 enhance antibody dependent cell medicate cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) effector function . A previous phase I/II study intravenously ( IV ) administer ocaratuzumab refractory/relapsed follicular lymphoma patient conclude ocaratuzumab safe well-tolerated dos 375mg/ m2 weekly four week . In proposed phase I study , ocaratuzumab administer subcutaneously patient previously treat CD20+ B-cell malignancy . Three dose level ( 40 mg weekly x 4 dos , 80 mg weekly x 4 dos , 80 mg weekly x 8 dos ) investigate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetic , pharmacodynamic analysis .</brief_summary>
