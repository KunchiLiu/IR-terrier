	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer 2nd lead cause mortality men develop country . For metastatic prostate cancer patient , 1st-line treatment relies hormone therapy . However , efficacy androgen deprivation therapy remain limited time patient eventually develop castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) , remain androgen-dependent . Docetaxel currently standard care metastatic CPRC . It show testosterone level within metastatic tumoral tissue men receive hormone therapy significantly higher primitive tumor untreated prostate cancer . Among mechanistic explanation observation , show CYP17A1 , key enzyme de novo steroid synthesis localize testis adrenal gland , up-regulated CRPC metastasis . The existence de novo CYP17A1-dependent androgen biosynthesis tumor level support development novel antiandrogens , include abiraterone acetate ( AA ) , irreversible CYP17A1 inhibitor . Based placebo-controlled phase III trial , demonstrate abiraterone prolong overall survival ( 14.8 vs 10.9 month ) increase PSA response rate ( 29 % vs 6 % ) patient metastatic CRPC previously receive docetaxel , AA recently approve FDA French Health Authorities . AA well-tolerated main toxicity urinary tract infection ( 2 % ) syndrome secondary mineralocorticoid excess characterize fluid overload , hypertension hypokaliema ( 1 % 4 % grade 3-4 ) . Almost concomitantly , novel taxane-class cytotoxic agent , cabazitaxel , proven efficacy CRPC treatment failure docetaxel , recently approve FDA French Health Authority . Although cabazitaxel exhibit less favorable toxicity profile , precise context creates need dispose objective individual criterion orientate patient treatment towards AA towards cabazitaxel . To purpose , several approach potential interest identify good candidate treatment AA : tumor-specific TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion measurement , circulate tumor cell analysis , tumoral CYP17A1 expression , analysis splice form androgen receptor . However , clinical relevance potential predictive factor remain established setting . Pharmacogenetics examine germinal gene polymorphism likely influence pharmacodynamics anticancer agent . Encouraging result recently report group irinotecan pharmacogenetics concrete possibility individual dose adaptation , recently investigator sunitinib pharmacogenetics . Concerning AA , one hypothesize tumor elevate CYP17A1 expression likely respond good AA . This hypothesis indirectly support observation CPRC patient receive AA , PSA-based response high patient elevate pre-treatment blood concentration DHEA androstenedione . The CYP17A1 gene present numerous single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) , whose frequency rare allele least 12 % . Their functional impact suggest nine , link either risk develop prostate cancer survival prostate cancer patient . So far , study examine link polymorphisms efficacy CYP17A1 inhibitor . Also , relationship efficacy androgen deprivation therapy recently report SNPs gene involve membrane-transport testosterone dehydroepiandrosterone , namely SLCO2B1 SLCO1B3 . One make hypothesis gene polymorphisms transporter may play role intratumoral concentration testosterone locally-produced mediation CYP17A1 activity . To resume , two second-line treatment metastatic CRPC cancer currently available , thus raise question practice treatment appropriate give patient . Herein , present study propose original pharmacogenetic approach order highlight relationship AA activity patient 's genetic profile . Ultimately , could reveal evidence genetic predisposition potentially good responder AA treatment .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 year . Histologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma . ECOG ≤ 2 . Evidence metastatic disease presence document locoregional distant metastasis CT scan abdomen and/or pelvis , bone scintigraphy . Patients disease progression prior docetaxel chemotherapy regimen , define : Progressive measurable disease : At least 20 % increase sum long diameter measurable lesion small sum observe appearance one new measurable lesion assess CT scan . Soft tissue disease progression define modified RECIST 1.1 criterion ( baseline lymph node size must ≥ 2.0 cm consider target evaluable lesion ) . OR Bone Scan Progression : appearance 2 new lesion bone scan . OR Increasing serum PSA level : Two consecutive increase PSA level document previous reference value obtain least one week apart require . If third PSA value less second , additional fourth test confirm rise PSA acceptable . A minimum start value 2.0 ng/mL require study entry . NOTE : Androgen ablative therapy may include either medical surgical castration . At least one prior chemotherapy regimen docetaxel . At least 28 day elapse withdrawal antiandrogens enrolment , except LHRH agonist therapy must continue throughout study patient already treat . Hormonal castration confirm biologically ( testosterone &lt; 0.5 ng/ml ) . Patient adequate organ function10 . Patient able swallow abiraterone acetate whole tablet . Information deliver patient inform consent sign patient legal representative . Patient affiliate health insurance system . Patients already treat abiraterone acetate . Known hypersensitivity allergy abiraterone excipients Patients suffer severe moderate hepatic impairment ( ChildPugh Class B C ) , active symptomatic viral hepatitis renal impairment . Any radiation within 28 day prior study entry . Patient central nervous system ( CNS ) metastasis history CNS metastasis . Patient treat cancer prostate cancer , exception basal cell carcinoma , within past 5 year . Treatment another therapeutic clinical trial within 28 day enrolment Prior treatment novel hormonal agent include enzalutamide , orteronel , ARN509 , EPI100 novel non hormonal treatment include cabozantinib , alpharadin . Patients uncontrolled hypertension , heart disease clinically significant ( myocardial infarction recent arterial thrombotic event , severe unstable angina , heart failure class IIIIV NYHA ( appendix 5 ) measurement cardiac ejection fraction &lt; 50 % ) , within 6 month randomization . Any significant concurrent medical illness opinion Investigator would preclude protocol therapy . Permanent contraindication corticosteroid . Patients partner childbearing potential willing use refuse 2 method birth control adequate barrier protection study 13 week last study drung administration . Patient history poor compliance current past psychiatric condition severe acute chronic medical condition would interfere ability comply study protocol . Patient enables give inform consent .</criteria>
