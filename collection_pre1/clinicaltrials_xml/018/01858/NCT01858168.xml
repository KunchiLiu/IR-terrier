	<brief_summary>This research study Two arm Phase I clinical trial , test safety investigational drug combination drug also try define appropriate dose combination investigational drug use study . `` Investigational '' mean combination drug study . It also mean FDA yet approve combination drug type cancer . Olaparib work block activity protein call poly ( ADP-ribose ) polymerase ( PARP ) involve DNA repair . Cancer cell rely PARP repair DNA enable continue divide . Olaparib use research study cancer . Information research study suggest drug may help treat patient Ewing 's sarcoma . The investigational drug olaparib approve use outside research study . Temozolomide ( Temodar ) approve FDA treatment type brain tumor , glioblastoma . It study Ewing sarcoma previous research study . While approved FDA Ewing sarcoma , consider part standard treatment relapse disease . Irinotecan approve FDA treatment gastrointestinal cancer . It study Ewing sarcoma previous research study . While approved FDA Ewing sarcoma , consider part standard treatment relapse disease . Laboratory study suggest combination olaparib temozolomide irinotecan may help kill Ewing sarcoma cell . In research study , investigator look high dose combination olaparib irinotecan and/or temozolomide give safely . The investigator also begin collect information effect combination Ewing sarcoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If patient agrees participate research study ask undergo screening test procedure confirm eligible . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn take part research study . If test procedure recently , may may repeat . These test procedure include : medical history , complete physical examination , performance status , tumor assessment , EKG , blood test , pregnancy test , confirmation pathology report obtain insurance approval receive temozolomide . If test show patient eligible participate research study , begin study drug administration . If meet eligibility criterion , able participate research study . Biomarkers substance gene protein important biological `` indicator '' measure tumor tissue . The investigator would like look biomarkers patient receive study drug administration . Comparing biomarkers tissue collect receive study treatment may help u find biomarkers associate response study treatment lack response study drug administration . Before patient start study drug administration , investigator determine patient healthy enough biopsy , patient undergo biopsy provide tumor tissue research test describe . ( If determine patient biopsy , still take part research study ) . The investigator look high dos olaparib temozolomide administer safely without severe unmanageable side effect participants Ewing 's sarcoma . Therefore , everyone participates research study receive dos olaparib temozolomide . The dos patient get depend number participant enrol study well tolerated dos . The investigator tell patient dose level receive compare dose give previously study . Olaparib irinotecan and/or temozolomide ge give cycle 21 day ( 3 week ) . Both olaparib temozolomide drug take mouth . Patients take olaparib temozolomide day 1-7 ( week 1 ) cycle . Irinotecan give IV , per day , day 1-7 cycle . Patients take olaparib twice per day temozolomide per day . The investigator give patient drug diary record dose olaparib temozolomide take day . The diary also include special instruction take olaparib temozolomide . A member study team show patient enter dos diary . During cycle 1 patient come clinic Days 1 8 ( week 1 2 ) . During cycle 2-6 come clinic Day 1 cycle . During cycle 8 beyond come clinic every 9 week . At study visit patient undergo follow procedure : physical exam , question health ( problem , medication , side effect ) , performance status blood test . Additionally , visit Cycle 1 , Day 8 patient EKG . 4-6 week start study drug administration blood test clotting ability Day 1 Cycle 2 . They also undergo biopsy provide tumor tissue biomarker research test . Every 9 week wil CT scan MRI measure tumor . Patients ask return clinic 30 day stop study drug . At visit follow do : physical exam , question health , performance status blood test . Patients ask return study drug bottle unused study drug visit . The investigator would like keep track patient ' medical condition long allow . The investigator would like either call patient telephone follow clinic visit every 3 month . Keeping touch patient check condition help investigator look long-term effect research study .</detailed_description>
