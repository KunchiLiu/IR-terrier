	<brief_summary>Abstract Research Proposal Radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) prove curative treatment minimal invasiveness high efficacy small hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) generally define maximal diameter large 3cm . RFA achieve rate complete necrosis 80-100 % small HCC . However , rate drop 71 % HCC 3.1-5cm 25 % HCC large 5cm。This due relative hypervascularity big tumor induce heat sink lead less effect ablation . Therefore , transcatheter chemoembolization ( TACE ) RFA may reduce vascularity enhance effect subsequent RFA . Moreover , pre-RF TACE reduce tumor size subsequent RFA effective RFA alone . In retrospective study , Kitamoto M et al show tumor necrosis diameter large TACE RFA combination therapy compare RFA mono-therapy ; Yamakado K et al show TACE RFA combination therapy HCC ( maximal diameter 12 cm ) achieve 100 % complete necrosis , 0 % local recurrence rate 93 % 2-year survival rate . Nevertheless , one randomize trial intermediate size HCC ( 3-5cm diameter ) show TACE RFA combination therapy achieve significant high rate complete necrosis , technique success , few treatment session achieve complete necrosis lower local recurrence non-significant difference 3-year survival rate . Therefore , base limited study , combine TACE RFA may achieve good effect RFA mono-therapy HCC large 3cm . However , repeat TACE may induce complication HBV reactivation , hepatitis even liver decompensation . Moreover , novel RFA use simultaneous multiple RFA probe switch RF controller may achieve good effect short ablation time sequential RFA single electrode . Thus , still necessary use TACE RFA combination therapy HCC &gt; 3cm application novel switch RF controller ? The aim current study conduct RCT compare combine TACE RFA compare RFA mono-therapy use simultaneous multiple electrode switch RF controller uni-lobar HCC 3.1-7cm . The rate complete necrosis , technique success , session achieve CN , local tumor progression , survival rate major complication analyze . Investigators expect one good , safe achievement study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims : The aim current study compare TACE RFA combination therapy RFA mono-therapy use simultaneous multiple electrode switch RF controller treatment uni-lobar HCC 3.1 7cm . The rate complete necrosis ( CN ) , technique success , session achieve CN , local tumor progression , survival rate major complication analyze . Background : HCC 4th mostly common malignancy worldwide lead cause cancer-death Taiwan . Surveillance program detect HCC early stage . Surgical resection , liver transplantation local ablation currently consider curative treatment modality early stage HCC . However , 10-30 % early stage HCC suitable resection due poor liver reserve , co-morbidity shortage liver donor . Therefore , local ablation play important role treatment unresectable resectable early-stage HCC . Among various local ablative modality , radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) prove curative treatment minimal invasiveness high efficacy small HCC generally define maximal diameter large 3cm . RFA achieve rate complete necrosis 80-100 % small HCC . However , rate drop 71 % HCC 3.1-5cm 25 % HCC &gt; 5cm。 The difference due relative hypervascularity big tumor induce heat sink lead less effect ablation . Therefore , transcatheter chemoembolization ( TACE ) RFA may reduce vascularity enhance effect subsequent RFA . Moreover , pre-RF TACE reduce tumor size subsequent RFA unembolized viable tumor effective RFA alone . In retrospective study , Kitamoto M et al show tumor necrosis diameter large combine TACE RFA compare RFA monotherapy ; Yamakado K et al show combine TACE RFA HCC ( maximal diameter 12 cm ) achieve 100 % complete necrosis , 0 % local recurrence rate 93 % 2-year survival rate . Nevertheless , one randomize trial intermediate size HCC ( 3-5cm diameter ) show combine TACE RFA achieve significant high rate technique success , few treatment session low local recurrence non-significant 3-year survival rate . Therefore , base limited study , combine TACE RFA may achieve good effect RFA mono-therapy HCC large 3cm . However , repeat TACE may induce complication HBV reactivation , hepatitis even liver decompensation . Moreover , novel RFA use simultaneous multiple RFA probe switch RF controller may achieve good effect short ablation time sequential RFA single electrode . Thus , still necessary use TACE RFA combination therapy HCC &gt; 3cm application novel switch RF controller ? aim current study conduct RCT compare combine TACE RFA compare RFA mono-therapy use simultaneous multiple electrode switch RF controller uni-lobar HCC 3.1-7cm . The rate complete necrosis , session achieve CN , primary technique effectiveness ( i.e . achievement complete necrosis maximum 3 treatment session ) , local tumor progression , survival rate major complication analyze .</detailed_description>
