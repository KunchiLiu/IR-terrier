	<brief_summary>In United States , ~1 million elective hip knee replacement surgery perform annually . With estimate surgical site infection ( SSI ) rate high 2.5 % , represent ~25,000 patient risk potentially avoidable morbidity follow low extremity joint replacement surgery . Although SSIs account 20 % HAIs , major risk factor prosthetic joint infection ( PJIs ) . Furthermore , UTIs also identify independent risk factor infection implant hardware . In general , majority PJIs become apparent within 3 month hardware implantation , deep infection may evident one year surgery . Hardware infection result delay healing , repeat surgical intervention , long-term antibiotic therapy . PJIs associated average increase hospital LOS 14 day , additional expenditure $ 50,000 per infect joint , double mortality rate compare uninfected low extremity joint replacement . Recent work group suggest vitamin D insufficiency may risk factor perioperative HAIs . The prevalence vitamin D insufficiency approximately 40 % elective joint replacement surgery patient , perioperative 25 ( OH ) D level drop 30-40 % set surgical stress , remain 20 % baseline 3 month surgery . To date , perioperative vitamin D optimization strategy report . Therefore , goal study effect single ( pre-operative ) versus divide ( pre-operative post-operative day 1 ) dose cholecalciferol perioperative vitamin D status patient schedule elective hip knee joint replacement surgery .</brief_summary>
