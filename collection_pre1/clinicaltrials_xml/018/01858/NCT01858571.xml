	<detailed_description>Many pediatric malignancy curable progression front line 2nd line chemotherapy . Further therapy conventional drug impose many side effect decrease QOL . The usual therapy offer patient best supportive care . Metronomic chemotherapy induce tumor stabilization tumor responses patient cancer refractory relapse conventional chemotherapy . Whether metronomic therapy well best supportive care know . In order , study require may compare metronomic therapy placebo therapy PFS QOL relapse refractory case pediatric solid tumor fail least two line chemotherapy . It double blind randomized study . One group receive metronomic therapy along best supportive care receive placebo best supportive care . The treatment continue till progression document . Metronomic chemotherapy schedule : Alternating cycle Cycle A B ( Each cycle include 3 week drug administration ) drug round near tablet/capsule size . Cycle A - Daily oral Thalidomide ( 3mg/kg ) - Daily oral Celecoxib ( 100 mg BID patient &lt; 20 kg , 200 mg BID patient 20-50 kg , 400 mg BID patient &gt; 50 kg ) - Daily oral Etoposide ( 50 mg/m2/d ) Cycle B - Daily oral Thalidomide ( 3mg/kg ) - Daily oral Celecoxib ( 100 mg BID patient &lt; 20 kg , 200 mg BID patient 20-50 kg , 400 mg BID patient &gt; 50 kg ) - Daily oral Cyclophosphamide ( 2.5 mg/kg/d maximum 100 mg/d ) every 21 day Placebo : Alternating cycle Cycle A B ( Each cycle include 3 week drug administration ) - Capsules size color use metronomic therapy Best supportive care - Management pain per WHO standard pain management The dose medication capsule round near capsule size . Instead round daily dose , total dose week would calculate rounded divide 5-6 day week . This do prevent extra dosing . If grade 3-4 toxicity occur first course , dose chemotherapy would reduce subsequent course 20 % .</detailed_description>
