	<brief_summary>Some men newly diagnose prostate cancer require immediate treatment . Rather , follow closely regular physical exam , blood work repeat biopsy prostate . If prostate cancer become aggressive , curative treatment offer time . This strategy delay treatment necessary call active surveillance prostate cancer . Active surveillance way monitor prostate cancer aim avoid delay unnecessary treatment men less aggressive cancer . Prostate cancer slow grow , many men , disease may never progress cause symptom . In word , many men prostate cancer never need treatment . Treatments prostate cancer may cause side effect affect quality life . By monitor cancer regular test , avoid delay side effect . Active surveillance generally suitable men low risk early stage prostate cancer contain within prostate gland ( localized prostate cancer ) . If doctor better way identifying might best suit approach , would likely become appeal men . In study , investigator look accurate magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan identify high-risk prostate cancer , might make man poor candidate active surveillance . To , investigator collect data MRI scan men compare trans-rectal biopsy perform following scan . The result study help inform doctor accurate MRI identify men active surveillance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Before research start ( screen ) : After sign consent form , ask undergo screening test procedures find research study . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn take part research study . If test procedure recently , may may repeat . - A medical history , include question health , current medication , allergy evaluation whether safely MRI biopsy - Performance status , evaluate able carry usual activity . - Review initial diagnostic biopsy , diagnosed prostate cancer . - Routine Blood Tests ( PSA protein produce prostate gland . The PSA test widely use screen men prostate cancer . It also use monitor men diagnose prostate cancer see cancer respond therapy ) - Physical Exam - Health State Questionnaires - These questionnaire review : Your feeling cancer diagnosis , satisfaction cancer care receive , health symptom past four week , overall urinary function If test show eligible participate research study , begin study treatment . If meet eligibility criterion , able participate research study . After screen procedure confirm eligible participate research study : - You schedule MRI 2 14 month initial biopsy , show prostate cancer , assess grade extent prostate cancer since initial diagnosis . - You schedule repeat prostate biopsy 0-3 month MRI review . Based finding MRI , biopsy perform either urologist 's office ultrasound ( medical imaging technique use high frequency sound wave echo ) use anesthesia MRI guide biopsy take within prostate . If MRI show anything concern , another ultrasound-guided biopsy similar one initially diagnosed prostate cancer . In procedure twelve biopsy sample take prostate . Each biopsy length dime narrow toothpick . If MRI finding need evaluation , guide biopsy . In procedure , twelve sample take prostate similar biopsy diagnose prostate cancer . Additionally , several biopsy take area area concern note MRI . This procedure require anesthesia , may general anesthesia another type . You meet study physician prior biopsy procedure . The type anesthesia use decide study physician discussion . When undergo study MRI system , lie motionless inside device Occasionally machine produce loud banging noise , pound outside hammer . Earplugs available reduce sound level . While magnet , anesthetic , investigator biopsy . To investigator use 2 way help u reach correct part prostate , one robotic needle holder , show u put needle , line correct place outside skin rectal wall study physician push needle his/her hand . Second investigator use model best location ( ) , take image . The biopsy do needle put skin , scrotum rectal wall doctor . The entire length procedure approximately 3 hour . The result procedure biopsy communicate doctor soon available . The result also share research co-investigators . This do share pathology result biopsy matched location/place come gland . The study doctor share result biopsy end study visit . Medical Information The investigator collect medical information come Dana-Farber Cancer Institute link information specimen investigator may better understand test affect participant time . It important note follow : blood , tissue , data collect participant use research research perform sample , investigator conduct research access participant identification information , medical record number . End study visit : You end study visit approximately 30 day final biopsy perform . At visit , study staff : - Review current PSA lab value - Review result biopsy discuss option future treatment . - Ask complete several `` Health- State '' questionnaire already do - Review side effect may experience result recent biopsy .</detailed_description>
