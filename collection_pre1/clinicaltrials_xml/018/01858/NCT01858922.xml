	<brief_summary>Subjects type cancer call Hodgkin Disease ( HD ) , cancer lymph system . The lymph system make tissue throughout body make store infection-fighting cell . HD one treatable childhood cancer . The standard treatment HD involve chemotherapy ( treatment anti-cancer drug ) radiation therapy ( use high-dose x-ray get rid cancer cell ) . Although cured cancer , patient experience negative side effect treatment later life . These kind side effect often refer late effect . This include problem growth , problem organ function , sometimes second cancer . These type effect associate either chemotherapy radiation therapy . The investigator therefore design study minimize prevent late effect . It think patient successfully treat without radiation , patient might experience few late side effect . Some patient , however , respond well first stage treatment ( slow early responder ) . Slow early responder consider high risk relapse . This study also look whether kind patient benefit additional chemotherapy . The purpose study look immune system recovers certain T-cells blood behave receive chemotherapy without radiation . The investigator also want identify bio-markers ( special protein blood cancer ) relate response HD study treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chemotherapy With Without Radiation , Low Intermediate Risk Hodgkins Lymphoma , TXCH-HD-12A</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At first subject 2 cycle cancer drug ( Doxorubicin , Bleomycin , Vincristine , Etoposide , Prednisone , Cyclophosphamide ) . The doctor call combination cancer drug ABVE-PC short . A cycle equal 21 day . The cancer drug give intravenously ( IV ) . Those patient evaluate early response treatment put group Rapid Early Responders ( RERs ) . The RER group include patient whose disease reduce 60 % . The next step patient RERs 2 cycle ABVE-PC chemotherapy follow another evaluation response . Those determine complete response ( least 80 % disease reduction ) receive therapy . Those patient determine less complete response receive radiation therapy within 6 week last cycle blood count recover . Radiation therapy give involve area standard care hospital ( Texas Children 's Hospital ) . After radiation subject treatment . Patients disease reduction le 60 % put group Slow Early Responders ( SERs ) . The next step patient SER 2 cycle DECA ( Dexamethasone , Etoposide , Cytarabine , Cisplatin ) . On Days 1 2 , subject give dexamethasone IV first ; afterwards , receive Etoposide Cytarabine mixture . Cisplatin give IV Day 1 . BIOLOGY TESTS The doctor investigate molecule tumor blood may help good understand biology Hodgkin 's Disease . These study may also help understand difference patient ' response therapy . TISSUE FOR BIOMARKER STUDIES The doctor want study material show make-up cancer ( gene cancer tissue ) special `` marker '' tissue . Tissue subject 's cancer biopsy use study . They collect sample subject biopsy clinical reason . IMMUNE FUNCTION AND BIOMARKER BLOOD TESTS The doctor also want collect blood sample study subject 's immune system look biomarkers blood .</detailed_description>
