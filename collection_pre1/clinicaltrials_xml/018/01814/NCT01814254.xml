	<brief_summary>Estimation hydration state dialysis patient major challenge clinical practice . Although many method study , none establish yet clinical routine practice . The investigator develop method , use segmental calf bioimpedance spectroscopy ( cBIS ) techniques measure body hydration . The device use base FDA-approved Hydra 4200 ( Xitron Technologies , San Diego , CA ) . The Hydra 4200 initially developed measure whole body segmental body fluid volume Hydra approve measure healthy subject . The cBIS monitor hydration state continuously measure change resistance resistivity calf hemodialysis ( HD ) use simple measurement , dialysis . Preliminary result clinical study show optimal hydration state HD patient may determine calf method . This study aim compare Hydra 4200 two device : FDA approve ZOE ( 100 kHz ) Fluid Status Monitor ( Noninvasive Medical Technologies , Inc , Las Vegas ) modify version ZOE 5 kHz . The modified ZOE monitor ( ZOE ( 5 kHz ) ) deliver frequency 5 kHz 0.8 mA current instead 100 kHz 2 mA . The subject study include group hemodialysis patient group healthy control . The healthy control use identify normal range within healthy population method . Each hemodialysis patient study twice different hydration state . The study change procedure patient 's dialysis treatment . Since device base noninvasive bioimpedance technique , study minimal risk .</brief_summary>
