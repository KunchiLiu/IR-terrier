	<brief_summary>The overall objective propose research use innovative methodological framework , Multiphase Optimization Strategy ( MOST ) , design , first time , optimize , scalable version technology-supported intensive lifestyle intervention ( INLI ) obesity . MOST involves highly efficient randomize experimentation ass effect individual treatment component , thereby identify component component level make important contribution overall program effect weight loss . This information guide assembly optimize treatment package achieve target outcome least resource consumption participant burden . Because intervention strategy test minimize in-person coaching leverage technology participant already , new optimize intervention , call Opt-IN , scalable traditional INLIs . Opt-IN thus enjoy greatly increased reach , enable significant progress fight obesity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Opt-IN : Optimization Remotely Delivered Intensive Lifestyle Treatment Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal propose study determine optimal composition technology support intervention obesity minimize expense burden participant , achieve 6 month weight loss outcome comparable superior achieve current full cost , full burden form INLIs . All intervention component examine select base Opt-IN model 's prediction enhance behavioral adherence weight regulation via designate pathway . The five component test : ( 1 ) coaching intensity ( 12 vs. 24 phone session ) , ( 2 ) text messaging ( No v . Yes ) , ( 3 ) progress report participant 's primary care provider ( No v . Yes ) , ( 4 ) recommendation use meal replacement ( No v . Yes ) , ( 5 ) training participant ' self-selected buddy supportive ( No v . Yes ) .</detailed_description>
