	<brief_summary>The purpose research study compare effectiveness commonly use decolonization treatment ( application mupirocin antibiotic ointment nose bleach bath ) perform individual history skin soft tissue infection ( SSTI ) prior year ( individualized approach ) comparison decolonization household member ( household approach ) attempt prevent Staphylococcus aureus skin infection . The investigator hypothesize individualized decolonization approach equally effective household approach prevent SSTI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) uniformly associate hospital-acquired infection ; however , MRSA strain emerge thrive outside hospital environment , cause significant morbidity mortality among immunocompetent individual , lead designation community-acquired methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( CA-MRSA ) . There available vaccine S. aureus . Thus , preventive measure , include topical antimicrobial therapy , use attempt prevent staphylococcal infection . These therapy include mupirocin ( topical antibiotic activity MRSA ) dilute bleach water bath . The effectiveness measure direct patient colonized traditional MSSA HA-MRSA strain attempt prevent nosocomial infection varies across study , maintenance eradication diminishes time . With emergence CA-MRSA epidemic , measure extrapolate patient community setting . We aim find practical approach decolonization patient feasibly perform home reduce incidence skin soft tissue infection ( SSTI ) . Specific Aim : Compare effectiveness decolonization individual history SSTI prior year ( individualized approach ) decolonization household member ( household approach ) reduce incidence recurrent SSTI . Primary hypothesis : An individualized decolonization approach equally effective decolonization household member prevent SSTI . Secondary hypothesis : Application mupirocin anterior naris twice daily 5 day result high prevalence colonization mupirocin-resistant strain subsequent longitudinal sampling .</detailed_description>
