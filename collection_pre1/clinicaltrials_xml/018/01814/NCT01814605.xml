	<brief_summary>A new ultrasound-guided `` subgluteal space '' approach sciatic nerve block recently describe obviates need identify sciatic nerve . The investigator hypothesize use ultrasound-guided subgluteal space injection perform sciatic nerve block increase proportion patient experience complete sensory block terminal branch Sciatic nerve comparison proportion receive block via ultrasound-guided infragluteal approach circumferential injection patient schedule unilateral TKA ( total knee arthroplasty ) surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sciatic Nerve Block Using Subgluteal Space Approach : A Comparison With Infragluteal Approach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The subgluteal space technique perform inject local anesthetic space sandwich gluteus maximus biceps femoris muscle level great trochanter ischial tuberosity rather circumferentially around nerve . The bone landmarks particularly easy identify high acoustic mismatch attenuation bone . The end point technique distention subgluteal space injection block needle . This new approach may translate benefit include reduce block procedure time , reduce number needle pass , reduce side effect ( vascular complication ) , ultimately block success . The philosophy inject local anesthetic designate anatomic space fascial plane nerve travel , fascia iliaca block example , time test approach become popular introduction ultrasound ease visualize fascia bone comparison nerve ultrasound . The call injecting plane stay away nerve block found support evidence trial involve ultrasound-guided brachial plexus block interscalene level . One important potential advantage subgluteal space approach may increase safety margin create distance maintain inject needle target nerve , advantage seem make injection technique progressively popular expand variety single continuous nerve block . The investigator aim compare newly describe ultrasound-guided subgluteal space block technique sciatic nerve currently practice ultrasound-guided infragluteal sciatic nerve block circumferential perineural spread patient undergoing unilateral TKA surgery .</detailed_description>
