	<detailed_description>Plasmodium vivax malaria major cause morbidity recognise important contributor mortality endemic area . Unlike P. falciparum malaria , P. vivax infection form dormant liver stage ( hypnozoites ) cause relapse infection week month initial attack 2 year . Relapse rate South-East Asia commonly exceed 50 % , often make relapse main cause vivax illness . Repeated relapse particularly damaging health development child vivax endemic area . The first line treatment vivax malaria combination chloroquine ( provide blood schizontocidal activity ) , primaquine ( provide liver hypnozoitocidal activity ) . However chloroquine resistance increase many vivax endemic area adherence 14 day primaquine regimens poor . This major threat current malaria control elimination initiative . Primaquine , 8 aminoquinoline , currently license drug activity hypnozoites . An important constraint global deployment primaquine potential cause haemolysis patient glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency ( G6PDd ) , typically occur 2-15 % ( 40 % ) patient endemic zone . Individuals less 10 % normal enzyme activity risk life-threatening haemolysis whereas milder variant may negligible effect . In practice lack available robust diagnostics G6PDd , concern drug toxicity , misperceive benign nature P. vivax infection result healthcare provider rarely prescribe primaquine even recommend policy . The main determinant primaquine efficacy total dose primaquine administer , rather dose schedule . Previous trial demonstrate standard low dose regimen primaquine ( 3.5 mg/kg total ) fail prevent relapse many different endemic location . For reason 2010 WHO antimalarial guideline recommend high dose regimen 7 mg/kg ( equivalent adult dose 30mg per day ) , although many country still recommend low dos fear cause serious harm unscreened G6PDd patient . Shorter course high daily dos primaquine potential improve adherence thus effectiveness without compromise efficacy . Primaquine also relatively weak clinically relevant asexual stage activity P. vivax large daily dos may substantially augment chloroquine 's blood stage activity low level resistance . In Thailand directly observe primaquine ( 1mg/kg/day ) administer 7 day well tolerate reduced relapse day 28 4 % . This encouraging definitive since many relapse present one month . Longer follow-up need distinguish whether relapse prevent deferred . If efficacy , tolerability safety short-course , high-dose primaquine regimen assure across range endemic setting , along reliable point-of-care G6PDd diagnostics , new primaquine regimen would major advance malaria treatment improve adherence thus effectiveness anti-relapse therapy . The radical cure P. vivax patient know G6PDd challenge . Current WHO guideline recommend weekly dose 0.75 mg/kg 8 week mitigate primaquine-induced haemolysis whilst retain efficacy . The weekly dosing schedule derive study USA small number healthy adult mildly primaquine-sensitive African A- G6PDd variant . Since host vulnerability haemolysis vary 100 different G6PDd variant , available evidence inadequate ensure universal safety 0.75mg/kg dose either single dose , advocate reduce transmission falciparum malaria , weekly dose radical cure vivax malaria . Due long duration standard primaquine treatment regimen , course difficult supervise , poorly adhere lack effectiveness . This propose multicentre randomise clinical trial provide evidence across variety endemic setting safety efficacy high dose-short course primaquine G6PD normal patient . In parallel single arm study investigator also gather safety data use weekly primaquine patient G6PDd . This study aim generate evidence directly inform global public health policy radical cure P. vivax .
