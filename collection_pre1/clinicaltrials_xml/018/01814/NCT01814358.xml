	<brief_summary>Risk heart blood vessel disease increase blood sugar rise . Blood vessel dysfunction common disease . Elevated blood sugar eat promotes blood vessel dysfunction . Dietary factor carbohydrates influence rise fall blood sugar . Dietary protein associate improved blood sugar control . Whey protein effectively blunts rise blood sugar consume carbohydrate rich drink/meal normal weight obese adult . This study investigate efficacy drink whey protein beverage prior eat improve daily blood sugar control normal weight obese adult `` real world . '' Also , study test dietary approach reduce blood vessel dysfunction associate eat meal cause blood sugar rise . 24 normal weight 24 obese men premenopausal woman ( 18-50y ) participate . Subjects wear sensor monitor daily blood sugar change response typically consume diet 2 day . Subjects report UCLA CTRC morning monitoring period measurement blood vessel function eat breakfast cereal meal . Blood sample obtain meal measure relevant health marker . Subjects repeat 2-day diet breakfast cereal meal challenge week , consume either chocolate flavor 1 ) whey protein 2 ) gelatin protein ( control ) shake prior meal . Neither subject researcher know protein ( `` double blind '' ) . Subjects receive alternate protein intervention another week ( `` crossover '' ) . We think drink protein shake prior meal reduce daily blood sugar rise fall eat blunt blood vessel dysfunction result eat breakfast cereal .</brief_summary>
