	<brief_title>Preoperative Hyperfractionated Radiotherapy Radiochemotherapy Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overview randomize trial conduct patient advanced colorectal cancer use preoperative radiotherapy radiochemotherapy clearly show superiority combine therapy surgery alone . In study document significant reduction tumor mass result preoperative radiotherapy radiochemotherapy theoretically increase chance perform operation sphincter preservation , even case originally eligible abdomino - perineal resection . There question whether combination preoperative hyperfractionated radiotherapy concurrent chemotherapy may cause improvement treatment outcome patient locally advanced rectal cancer . Published 2012 Gerard et al . meta-analysis randomized trial dedicate treatment patient advance colorectal cancer , confirm high percentage sphincter preservation patient operate 5-week interval neoadjuvant therapy surgery . Analysis issue take current study . Comparison two treatment regimen preoperative phase III study stratification time interval end radiotherapy radiochemotherapy surgery may show difference see previously publish data .</detailed_description>
