	<brief_title>Revitalization Immature Permanent Teeth With Necrotic Pulps Using SHED Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Irreversible damage immature permanent teeth result noxious infection local trauma normal physiological closure apical structure represent real clinical challenge . The conventional therapeutic approach consider use synthetic biocompatible material , calcium hydroxide [ Ca ( OH ) 2 ] mineral trioxide aggregate ( MTA ) , induce apical closure , apexification , form hard tissue barrier across root apex . However , neither MTA calcium hydroxide currently able either induce stimulate pulp regeneration , ensure conventional root development continue damage take place , inherent risk root fracture remain . Millions teeth accidentally avulse year due serious trauma sport , motor vehicle accident , criminal assault , fist fight , among incident . The risk high child permanent teeth still immature may lead lot complication also challenge treatment . Generally , tooth reimplantation effective therapy tooth avulsion , As know , The success tooth reimplantation depend maintenance vitality periodontal ligament , need parent teacher act quickly ( e.g. , within 2 h ) avulse tooth preserved appropriate medium , milk physiological saline , viable cell remain periodontal ligament ( PDL ) root surface play crucial role recover avulse tooth function . Along development new regenerative protocol resolve clinical deficiency , continue advance discovery characterization stem cell dental origin—able differentiate multiple tissue types—have recently broaden possible therapeutic horizon towards pulp periodontal tissue regeneration . Some study suggest recent discovery characterization stem cell human exfoliate deciduous teeth ( SHED ) form cell source apexogenesis immature teeth periradicular periodontitis endodontic origin . The purpose clinical trial clarify efficiency autologous SHED regenerate pulp periodontal tissue patient immature permanent teeth pulp necrosis confirm safety use autologous stem cell clinical endodontic regenerative medicine . This single-centre , randomize , control study . This study approve ethical committee School Stomatology , Fourth Military Medical University . The study conduct accord Declaration Helsinki .</detailed_description>
