	<brief_summary>The primary objective study compare image quality two endoscopic ultrasound ( EUS ) processor use image pancreas . Processor image use make correct clinical diagnosis high quality image related accurate result . Patient care may improve due information collect part study . The quality image utmost importance diagnose early neoplasm pancreas diseases chronic pancreatitis . Image quality dictate two factor : image resolution depth penetration . Good imaging enables diagnosis early stage disease thereby facilitate early treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endoscopic Ultrasound ( EUS ) Processor Comparison</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The endoscope usually connect processor generates image view monitor . At FH , use processor call Aloka 10 . A new processor develop Olympus Corporation call EU-ME 2 . This new processor FDA approve , launch commercially yet . It loan FH evaluation . We would like evaluate processor objective manner hence request study approval . In study , endoscopy procedure attach two different processor image generate . The choice processor use first discretion Endoscopist . This require removal reintroduction endoscope patient two occasion . Only connector switch different processor . So negligible risk patient . The time require research activity 5-10 minute . Both processor set procedure room duration study . The physician document depth penetration image ( farthest structure see ) image resolution ( evaluate pancreas subtle abnormality ) . Both processor use patient . The score processor document procedure log , use primary endpoint describe . The CRF patient information . Images view physician time procedure save recorded part study.. EUS perform standard fashion one experience endosonographers unit . Once EUS complete , procedure stop echoendoscope withdrawn patient . Patients transported recovery area observation per standard policy . After appropriate observation deem satisfactory , patient discharge per unit policy .</detailed_description>
