	<brief_summary>The aim current study analyze whether 18F-labeled Fluoromisonidazole ( 1- ( 2-nitro-1-imidazolyl ) - 2-hydroxy-3-fluoropropane [ 18F-FMISO ] ) PET/CT expression HIF-1-alpha could predict response primary endocrine therapy ER-positive breast cancer</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Approximately 30 % ER-positive breast cancer unfortunately display primary resistance hormonal therapy , may develop acquire resistance therapy initial treatment . Hypoxia normal phenomenon solid tumor arises , part , uncontrolled proliferation immature blood vessel . Previous study demonstrate hypoxia significantly reduce growth-promoting effect estradiol ( E2 ) growth-inhibitory effect antiestrogen ER-positive breast cancer cell line . A recent study compare neoadjuvant letrozole letrozole plus metronomic cyclophosphamide find increased level HIF-1a significantly associate resistance treatment . Taken together , data indicate hypoxia might associate endocrine resistance breast cancer . With PET/CT , radiolabeled hypoxia-avid compound apply evaluate oxygenation status experimental human tumor . 18F-labeled fluoromisonidazole ( 1- [ 2-nitro- 1-imidazolyl ] -2-hydroxy-3-fluoropropane [ 18F-FMISO ] ) PET/CT widely use one clinic . Studies demonstrate excellent correlation 18F-FMISO uptake oxygenation status several cancer include breast cancer . The major aim study analyze uptake 18FFMISO well IHC expression HIF-1-alpha ER-positive breast cancer , predict clinical , pathological biological response primary endocrine therapy .</detailed_description>
