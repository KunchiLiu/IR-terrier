	<brief_title>High Dose Omega-3 Fatty Acids Treatment Sport Related Concussions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In United States , estimate 1.7 million people sustain traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) annually ; associate 1.365 million emergency room visit 275,000 hospitalization annually associate direct indirect cost estimate 4 billion United States 2000 . Furthermore , US Center Disease Control Prevention estimate 1.6 3.8 million concussion occur sport recreational activity annually.3 However , figure grossly underestimate total burden traumatic brain injury ( TBIs ) concussion , many individual suffer mild moderate TBIs seek medical attention . Even though concussion type TBI frequently use interchangeably mild TBI medical literature ; mild refers initial impact rather long-term sequelae injury . Historically , definition concussion well define , 3rd International Conference Concussion Sport ( Zurich 2008 ) define concussion complex pathophysiological process affect brain , induce traumatic biomechanical force . Several common feature incorporate clinical , pathological biomechanical injury construct may utilize define nature concussive head injury include : Concussion may cause either direct blow head , face , neck elsewhere body `` impulsive '' force transmit head . This injury typically result rapid onset short-lived impairment neurologic function resolve spontaneously . It may result neuropathological change , acute clinical symptom largely reflect functional disturbance rather structural injury . It result grade set clinical sign symptom may may involve loss consciousness . Resolution clinical cognitive symptom typically follow sequential course ; however , important note , small percentage case , post-concussive symptom may prolong . No abnormality standard structural neuro-imaging study see concussion . Current data show average 91 % athlete sustain concussion symptom cognitive impairment resolve 7 ± 1.5 day balance deficit resolve day 5.13 Currently main treatment concussion cognitive physical rest symptom resolve graduated return activity . The neuropathological change concussion result functional disturbance clinical syndrome result depolarization potassium efflux neuron trigger release excitatory amino-acids like glutamine , turn activate N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor form pore calcium enters neuron . A large influx calcium cell trigger lysis arachidonic acid , calpain activation initiation apoptosis , formation reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) . Studies show incorporation omega-3 fatty acid cell membrane associate decreased generation intracellular ROS consequent diminish activation redox-sensitive transcription factor , nuclear factor- κβ system , modify expression pro-inflammatory gene . Incorporation omega-3 fatty acid also appear alter property lipid raft caveolae , contribute membrane fluidity , hormone-receptor binding function membrane associate protein affect . Omega-3 fatty acid also associate decreased level marker mediator inflammation cytokine interleukin-1β tumor necrosis factor ( TNF-α ) . Mills et al look effect omega-3 fatty acid supplementation head injury model rat . Docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) start approximately 24 hour injury , follow dos : 10 mg/kg/day group 1 40 mg/kg/day group 2 . The number beta-amyloid precursor protein ( APP ) -positive axon use measure level injury . There significant quantitative difference 182 ± 44.6 APP-positive axon un-supplemented animal versus sham-injured animal ( control animal ) , 4.1 ± 1.3 APP-positive axon per square millimeter . Group 1 show 26.1 ± 5.3 group 2 show 19.6 ± 4.7 , APP-positive axon . It notable omega-3 fatty acid supplementation group significantly reduce number APP-positive axon 30 day injury level similar uninjured animal . This study show pathologic improvement high dose omega-3 fatty acid supplementation , specifically DHA , head injury rat model . However , current human study medical literature look omega-3 fatty acid supplementation treatment concussion . Does high dose omega-3 fatty acid supplementation Division I NCAA athlete sustain concussion improve time symptom resolution , neurocognition postural stability thus decrease number day competitive sport ? Protocol : Once athlete qualifies study he/she randomly assign either high dose omega-3 fatty acid/DHA supplementation placebo . Demographics athlete obtain include : age , gender , sport , academic year , height , weight , BMI , history prior concussion , migraine , learn disability , psychiatric diagnosis . Both group undergo standard usual care concuss athlete East Carolina University . The physician athletic training staff evaluate clear athlete return activity blind . Currently East Carolina University employ regimented return-to-play protocol every student-athlete sustained concussion . As part pre-participation physical , student-athletes baseline computerize postural stability test use Biodex BioSway computerize neurocognitive test use ImPact . At time injury Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 2 ( SCAT2 ) administer certified athletic trainer , student-athlete withdrawn participation symptomatic and/or deficit note . The day concussion suspect repeat Biodex postural stability test also administer student-athlete give detailed information sheet instruction monitor follow-up . A repeat Impact neurocognitive test administer within 24 hour injury . The student-athlete see examined sport medicine physician review result , perform clinical exam confirm diagnosis . The student-athlete evaluated daily modify Symptom Evaluation Questionnaire find SCAT2 athletic trainer . When student-athlete asymptomatic activity daily live ( ADLs ) 24 hour , he/she begin non-contact return play protocol resemble Zurich 's beginning supervise cardiovascular challenge . This include 30 minute supervise light aerobic activity treadmill stationary bike . If athlete asymptomatic cardiovascular challenge he/she progress noncontact sport specific drill subsequent day . If athlete still well he/she progress non-contact training drill start light resistance training follow day . If student-athlete remain asymptomatic non-contact activity progression , he/she re-takes computerized neurocognitive test , postural stability assessment re-evaluated physician . If postural stability assessment neurocognitive test back baseline athlete clear discretion treat sport medicine physician return full unrestricted activity . However , student-athlete 's symptom continue day 7 Impact Biodex BioSway evaluation re-administered . This repeat 14 day 30 day post-injury student-athlete continue symptomatic .</detailed_description>
