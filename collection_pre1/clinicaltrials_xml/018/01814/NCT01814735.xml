	<brief_title>Substituting Brown Rice For White Rice : Effect On Diabetes Risk Factors In India</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , India large absolute number people diabetes world escalation diabetes incidence occur global free trade continue fuel rapid economic nutrition transition , especially urban setting . These transition accompany shift dietary consumption towards highly refine carbohydrate , fat , animal product . Evidence indicate consumption whole-grains decrease diabetes improve glycemic control . The propose proof-of-concept trial herein evaluate efficacy substitute brown rice , whole-grain , white rice Chennai , India , biomarkers diabetes risk also obtain glycemic index value local rice staple . The long-term goal develop multi-center nutritional-intervention India , China , Africa Latin America create sustainable diabetes prevention strategy improve carbohydrate quality . The investigator propose conduct 4-month randomized parallel-group intervention trial evaluate effect substitution brown rice white rice two meal per day six day per week biomarkers diabetes risk among adult Chennai , India high risk development diabetes . The first aim research determine glycemic index different local rice variety ( brown , red , fully polish white ) preparation ( regular parboil ) . The second aim determine effect brown rice substitution fast biomarker measurement glucose metabolism ( i.e. , glucose , insulin , hemoglobin A1c , homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance ) , dyslipidemia ( i.e. , triglyceride , total cholesterol , LDL- cholesterol , HDL-cholesterol ) , inflammation ( i.e. , C-reactive protein ) . This trial also demonstrate feasibility cultural appropriateness type intervention local environment result may translate future . This study important implication policy help local government develop national nutrition strategy diabetes prevention wide- spread education campaign health benefit whole-grains , school lunch program serve whole-grains . Such policy could also encourage ministry agriculture support production whole grain , thereby improve accessibility regulate cost . This work intend part large global initiative identify local , feasible sustainable dietary intervention reduce diabetes risk country experience epidemiologic transition improve carbohydrate quality staple food . Initiatives already launch group China , plan Tanzania , Nigeria , Puerto Rico Mexico . PUBLIC HEALTH RELEVANCE : Currently , India large absolute number people diabetes world , evidence indicate consumption whole-grains decrease diabetes improve glycemic control . Our study evaluate efficacy substitute brown rice , whole-grain , white rice Chennai , India , biomarkers diabetes risk . The ultimate goal research provide data use design global dietary intervention study aim reduce diabetes risk simple , culturally appropriate , feasible sustainable dietary change .</detailed_description>
