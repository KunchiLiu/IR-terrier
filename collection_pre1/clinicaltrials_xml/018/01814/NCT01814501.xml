	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well panitumumab combination chemotherapy work treat patient metastatic colorectal cancer previously treat combination chemotherapy bevacizumab . Monoclonal antibody , panitumumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , irinotecan hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving panitumumab combination chemotherapy together may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Panitumumab Chemotherapy Patients With Advanced Colorectal Cancer After Prior Therapy With Bevacizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine median progression-free survival patient treat leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , irinotecan hydrochloride ( FOLFIRI ) panitumumab K-ras NRAS wild-type , metastatic colorectal carcinoma already progress FOLFIRI + Bevacizumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine frequency severity toxicity regimens . II . To determine overall response rate . III . To determine median overall survival overall survival rate 1 year . OUTLINE : Patients receive panitumumab intravenously ( IV ) 60-90 minute , leucovorin calcium IV 90 minute , fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour , irinotecan hydrochloride IV 90 minute day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
