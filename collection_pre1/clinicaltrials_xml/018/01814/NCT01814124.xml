	<brief_summary>Femoroacetabular impingement ( FAI ) recognize formal source hip pain disability typically affect young adult , active population identify precursor hip osteoarthritis ( OA ) . Common impairment include sharp , anterior groin pain position hip flexion limit patient ' ability tolerate prolong sitting , squat , stair climbing , etc . result work limitation decrease social participation . Manual therapy exercise know effective reduce pain increase physical function management hip OA . To extent FAI often precursor develop hip OA , logic would seem dictate manual therapy plus exercise approach decrease pain disability potentially prevent delay osteoarthritis relate surgery . Currently , surgery consider first line treatment respect FAI . However , lack evidence support refute use conservative treatment intervention patient population . This study design investigate benefit physical therapy intervention ( manual therapy exercise ) usual care improve pain physical function patient FAI hip . For study , 52 participant recruit Department Orthopaedic Surgery , Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center , outpatient consultation consideration hip arthroscopy surgery . Participants include patient meet clinical radiological criterion formal diagnosis FAI . Participants randomize two treatment group . Participants one group receive usual care plus manual therapy direct hip well supervised exercise program home exercise program twice weekly six week . Participants usual care group receive usual care prescribe physician . Changes pain , physical function benefit intervention assess six week . Should research study demonstrate treatment effectiveness physical therapy intervention patient diagnose FAI hip , manual therapy plus exercise may potential delay prevent surgery patient population . Further , extent FAI show lead later development hip OA , effective treatment intervention may help delay prevent secondary osteoarthritis relate change well total joint replacement surgery associate hip OA . This study provide preliminary data use prepare grant application design determine safest , effective treatment patient FAI .</brief_summary>
