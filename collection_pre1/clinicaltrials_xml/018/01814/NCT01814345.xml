	<brief_summary>Gastric cancer remain major health issue lead cause cancer death worldwide , although prevalence mortality disease gradually decrease . The investigator option patient advanced disease . The trastuzumab Gastric Cancer ( ToGA ) trial , pivotal randomize clinical trial patient HER-2 positive advance , mostly metastatic , gastric cancer , prove efficacy trastuzumab ( anti-Her 2 therapy ) combination chemotherapy . The median overall survival significantly prolong trastuzumab-containing arm ( 13.8 vs. 11.1 month ; HR 0.74 ; p=0.0046 ) without unexpected toxicity include cardiac event . The survival benefit pronounce subgroup high HER-2/neu protein overexpression ( median overall survival 16 month ) . Only 20 % patient screen subsequently enrol study find HER2-positive utilizing immunohistochemistry FISH . Her2 test recommend patient advanced gastric cancer type III oesophageal adenocarcinoma . Data Indian patient lack . Hence , investigator plan test Her 2 100 patient IHC FISH 2+ 3+ patient .</brief_summary>
