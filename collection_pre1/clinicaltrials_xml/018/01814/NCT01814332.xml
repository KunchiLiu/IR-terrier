	<detailed_description>A grow body literature suggest stress-related disorder PTSD associate chronically increase activity CNS circuit utilize corticotropin-releasing factor ( CRF ) , neuropeptide involved mediate neuroendocrine , immune , autonomic , behavioral response stress . CRF1 receptor antagonist exert significant dampening effect system , never investigate patient PTSD . The investigator Mount Sinai School Medicine ( MSSM ) National Institute Mental Health ( NIMH ) Intramural Research Program conduct Phase II proof-of-concept clinical trial neurokinin-1 antagonist provide GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) . In investigation , conduct 2-site ( Emory MSSM ) , 6-week , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel-arm , fix dose trial evaluate efficacy , safety , tolerability GSK561679 154 female adult outpatient PTSD . The San Francisco Department Veterans Affairs Medical Center ( SFVAMC ) add site July 2012 . SFVAMC enroll 40 female adult outpatient PTSD . We propose investigate efficacy highly specific CRF1 antagonist GSK561679 PTSD placebo-controlled clinical trial . GSK561679 approve Food Drug Administration treatment condition . Furthermore , propose longitudinally investigate whether certain biological surrogate marker ( neuroendocrine , neurophysiology , genotyping ) predictive treatment response . If patient already take medication PTSD achieve therapeutic response , taper effective medication ( ) participate study , eligible study . Taper discontinuation medication preparation study occur patient respond medication treatment PTSD . Preclinical clinical literature also exist implicates hypothalamic extra hypothalamic CRF stress-related insomnia regulation non-rapid eye movement delta sleep . There preliminary evidence block CRF signal result immediate improvement stress-related sleep disturbance . Disturbed sleep prevalent symptom endorse PTSD patient . It potentially debilitate many domain function , outcome objectively precisely measure sleep EEG . Therefore , exploratory aim study investigate impact GSK561679 objective measure sleep continuity quantitative sleep EEG use ambulatory polysomnography . All subject enrol SFVAMC meet inclusion exclusion criterion study give option sleep monitor throughout study</detailed_description>
