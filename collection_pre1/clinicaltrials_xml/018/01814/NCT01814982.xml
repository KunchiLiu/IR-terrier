	<brief_title>An Efficacy , Safety , Pharmacokinetics , Pharmacodynamics Study JNJ-17299425 Participants With Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , multi-center ( conducted one center ) , exploratory study single repeat , escalate , intravenous ( injection substance vein ) dose JNJ-17299425 participant traumatic brain injury . The study consist 2 part ( Part 1 Part 2 ) , part 2 stage ( Stage 1 Stage 2 ) . In Stage 1 part standard care give , sedation , analgesia ventilation . If Intra cranial pressure ( ICP ) rise great 20 millimeter mercury ( mmHG ) ventricular drainage , participant enter Stage 2 part receive JNJ-17299425 ( single dose Part 1 repeat dose Part 2 ) . During Part 1 , safety efficacy JNJ-17299425 evaluate Part 2 , safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics repeat dos evaluate . Efficacy primarily evaluate reduction ICP . Blood sample collect pharmacokinetic evaluation pre post administration study treatment . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
