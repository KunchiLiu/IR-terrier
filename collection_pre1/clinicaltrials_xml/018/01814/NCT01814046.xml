	<brief_summary>Background : - The NCI Surgery Branch develop experimental therapy involve take white blood cell patient ' tumor , grow laboratory large number , give cell back patient . These cell call Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes , TIL give type treatment 200 patient melanoma . This study use chemotherapy prepare immune system white blood cell treatment . After receive cell , drug aldesleukin ( IL-2 ) may give help cell stay alive long . Objectives : - To see chemotherapy white blood cell therapy safe effective treatment advance ocular melanoma . Eligibility : - Individuals least great equal 16 year less equal 75 year advance ocular melanoma . Design : - Work stage : Patients see outpatient NIH clinical Center undergo history physical examination , scan , x-ray , lab test , test need . - Surgery : If patient meet requirement study undergo surgery remove tumor use grow TIL product . - Leukapheresis : Patients may undergo leukapheresis obtain additional white blood cell . { Leukapheresis common procedure , remove white blood cell patient . } - Treatment : Once cell grown , patient admit hospital conditioning chemotherapy , TIL cell aldesleukin . They stay hospital 4 week treatment . - Follow : Patients return clinic physical exam , review side effect , lab test , scan every 1-3 month first year , every 6 month 1 year long tumor shrink . Follow visit take 2 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunotherapy Using Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes Patients With Metastatic Ocular Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Metastatic ocular melanoma ( OM ) carry poor prognosis estimate survival 4-6 month . There know effective systemic therapy . Metastatic OM classify orphan disease currently clinical trial option patient . Thus , novel systemic approach desperately need . - Administration autologous tumor infiltrate lymphocyte ( TIL ) generate resect metastatic cutaneous melanoma induce objective long-term tumor response . - Minimally invasive , safe , effective surgical approach develop Surgery Branch procure liver tumor tissue TIL generation . Objectives : - To determine whether autologous Young TIL infuse without administration high-dose aldesleukin may result clinical tumor regression patient metastatic ocular melanoma receive non-myeloablative lymphoid deplete preparative regimen . - To study immunologic correlate associate Young TIL therapy ocular melanoma . - To determine toxicity treatment regimen . Eligibility : - Patients metastatic ocular melanoma great equal 16 year age , physically able tolerate non-myeloablative chemotherapy . Patients tolerate high-dose aldesleukin receive follow cell infusion ; tolerate high-dose aldesleukin due medical comorbidities refuse high dose aldesleukin receive cell infusion without aldesleukin . - There requirement prior systemic therapy , give lack know effective systemic treatment metastatic OM . Design : - Patients undergo biopsy resection obtain tumor generation autologous TIL culture autologous cancer cell line . - All patient receive non-myeloablative lymphocyte deplete preparative regimen cyclophosphamide fludarabine . - On day 0 patient receive 1x10 ( 9 ) 2x10 ( 11 ) young TIL begin high dose aldesleukin ( 720,000 IU/kg IV every 8 hour 15 dos ) aldesleukin medically eligible receive . - A complete evaluation evaluable lesion conduct 4-6 week last dose aldesleukin aldesleukin arm 4-6 week cell administration aldesleukin arm . - Patients enrol two cohort . The cohort receive high-dose aldesleukin ( cohort A ) conduct use small optimal two-stage Phase II design , initially 19 patient enrol , 4 first 19 patient clinical response ( PR CR ) , accrual continue 33 patient , target 35 % goal objective response . For cohort receive aldesleukin ( cohort B ) , study conduct Minimax two-stage phase II trial . Initially 12 evaluable patient enrol cohort , 1 first 12 response , accrual would continue total 21 patient , target 20 % goal objective response .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Measurable metastatic ocular melanoma . 2 . Confirmation diagnosis metastatic ocular melanoma Laboratory Pathology NCI . 3 . Patients 3 few brain metastasis less 1 cm diameter asymptomatic eligible . Lesions treat stereotactic radiosurgery must clinically stable 1 month treatment patient eligible . Patients surgically resect brain metastasis eligible . 4 . Greater equal 16 year age less equal age 75 . 5 . Able understand sign Informed Consent Document 6 . Willing sign durable power attorney 7 . Clinical performance status ECOG 0 1 8 . Life expectancy great three month 9 . Patients gender must willing practice birth control time enrollment study four month receive treatment . 10 . Serology : Seronegative HIV antibody . ( The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depends intact immune system . Patients HIV seropositive decrease immunecompetence thus less responsive experimental treatment susceptible toxicity . ) Seronegative hepatitis B antigen , seronegative hepatitis C antibody . If hepatitis C antibody test positive , patient must test presence antigen RTPCR HCV RNA negative . 11 . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test potentially dangerous effect treatment fetus . 12 . Hematology Absolute neutrophil count great 1000/mm3 without support filgrastim WBC great equal 3000/mm ( 3 ) Platelet count great equal 100,000/ mm ( 3 ) Hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 g/dl 13 . Chemistry : Serum ALT/AST less equal 3.5 time upper limit normal Serum creatinine less equal 1.6 mg/dl Total bilirubin less equal 2.0 mg/dl , except patient Gilbert Syndrome must total bilirubin less 3.0 mg/dl . 14 . More four week must elapse since prior systemic therapy time patient receives preparative regimen , patient toxicity must recover grade 1 less ( except toxicity alopecia vitiligo ) . Note : Patients may undergo minor surgical procedure within past 3 week , long toxicity recover grade 1 less specify eligibility criterion . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Women childbearing potential pregnant breastfeed potentially dangerous effect treatment fetus infant . 2 . Active systemic infection , coagulation disorder active major medical illness cardiovascular , respiratory immune system , evidence positive stress thallium comparable test , myocardial infarction , cardiac arrhythmia , obstructive restrictive pulmonary disease . 3 . Any form primary immunodeficiency ( Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease ) . 4 . Concurrent opportunistic infection ( The experimental treatment evaluate protocol depends intact immune system . Patients decrease immune competence may less responsive experimental treatment susceptible toxicity ) . 5 . Concurrent systemic steroid therapy . 6 . History severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction agent use study . 7 . The following patient exclude highdose aldesleukin arm ( may eligible cell alone arm ) : 1 . History coronary revascularization ischemic symptom 2 . Documented LVEF less equal 45 % . Testing required patient : Clinically significant atrial and/or ventricular arrhythmia include limited : atrial fibrillation , ventricular tachycardia , second third degree heart block Age great equal 60 year old 3 . Clinically significant patient history judgment Principal Investigator would compromise patient ability tolerate aldesleukin</criteria>
