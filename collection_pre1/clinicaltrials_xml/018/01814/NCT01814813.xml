	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well give vaccine therapy without bevacizumab work treat patient recurrent glioblastoma multiforme remove surgery . Vaccines consist heat shock protein-peptide complex make person 's tumor tissue may help body build effective immune response kill tumor cell may remain surgery . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill . It yet know whether give vaccine therapy effective without bevacizumab treat glioblastoma multiforme .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaccine Therapy With Bevacizumab Versus Bevacizumab Alone Treating Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study compare effect vaccine bevacizumab versus bevacizumab alone patient 's brain tumor . The vaccine call heat shock protein peptide complex 96 ( HSPPC-96 ) . HSPPC-96 experimental . Specifically , HSPPC-96 protein may work help body response remain brain tumor cell . Bevacizumab approve Food Drug administration treat brain tumor grow back . In study , patient either get HSPPC-96 vaccine time bevacizumab , HSPPC vaccine first bevacizumab tumor come back , bevacizumab alone . The use HSPPC-96 bevacizumab investigational . The primary objective study determine whether overall survival advantage HSPPC-96 administer bevacizumab , give concomitantly point progression , comparison bevacizumab alone patient surgically resectable recurrent glioblastoma multiforme . The secondary objective : 1. evaluate safety tolerability HSPPC-96 bevacizumab 2. evaluate progression free survival HSPPC-96 bevacizumab , give concomitantly point progression . Patients must undergo surgery within 28 day pre-registration . There must confirmation adequacy tissue vaccine manufacture , tumor tissue submit Agenus , confirmation ≥ 90 % resection central radiology review vaccine manufacture least six vial . Patients randomize one three treatment arm . Please see `` Arms '' section detail . Patients monitor approximately 5 year post-surgery .</detailed_description>
