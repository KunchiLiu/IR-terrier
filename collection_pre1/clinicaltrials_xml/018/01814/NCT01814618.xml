	<brief_title>Trial Directed High-dose Nasal Steroids Residual Smell Loss Sinus Patients After Sinus Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OVERVIEW : This prospective randomize cohort study assess use direct high-dose nasal steroid improve olfactory function endoscopic sinus surgery chronic rhinosinusitis . Up 70 subject prospectively enrol patient visit Department Otolaryngology-Head Neck Surgery clinic University North Carolina ( UNC ) Hospitals . VISIT 1/PRE-OPERATIVE VISIT Visit 1 day enrollment pre-operative visit . During encounter , subject complete Rhinosinusitis Disability Index ( RSDI ) , Rhinosinusitis Outcome Measure 31 ( RSOM-31 ) , Sinonasal Outcome Test 22 ( SNOT-22 ) , University Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test ( UPSIT ) , Phenyl-ethyl-alcohol ( PEA ) test also Lund-Kennedy score record . Additionally , subject undergo pre-operative ( standard care ) head CT score Lund-Mackay system . This standard care head CT bill subject 's insurance . VISIT 2/POST-OPERATIVE VISIT ( POV ) 1 Visit 2 occur `` post-operative visit 1 '' 4-6 week surgery . During encounter , subject complete RSDI , RSOM-31 , SNOT-22 , UPSIT , PEA test also Lund-Kennedy score record . Additionally , subject undergo post-operative ( standard care ) head CT . This standard care head CT bill subject 's insurance . Subjects quantitative improvement olfaction ( determine UPSIT category score ) consider part `` improved '' group simply follow without intervention . Subjects quantitative improvement olfaction randomize ( random number generator ) `` treatment '' `` observation '' group . Subjects within treatment group give 12-week course direct high-dose nasal steroid irrigation . Pharmacies bill subject ' insurance medication . Subjects instruct perform irrigation twice daily use Â½ budesonide respule , 0.5 mg/2mL , apply directly nasal mucosa describe previously . Subjects give write instruction perform nasal irrigation medication . Subjects randomize receive medication give medication diary ask document medication compliance side effect . PHONE INTERVIEW ( 1-2 WEEKS AFTER TREATMENT ) Subjects randomized treatment arm call 1-2 week initiation budesonide treatment assess medication compliance side effect . Subjects ask review medication diary answer question compliance side effect . As detailed data safety monitoring plan , PI alert subject experience moderate-severe adverse event unexpected side effect . VISIT 3/ '' SURVEILLANCE '' VISIT Visit 3 surveillance visit somewhere post-operative visit 1 ( 4-6 week ) post-operative visit 2 ( 3-4 month ) . Only patient treatment arm visit . During visit , subject ask medication compliance ask demonstrate irrigation technique nasal saline . Medication diaries review assessed compliance concern side effect . These diary collect future review independent data safety reviewer . VISIT 4/ POST-OPERATIVE VISIT ( POV ) 2 Visit 4 occur post-operative visit 2 3-4 month surgery . During encounter , subject complete RSDI , RSOM-31 , SNOT-22 , UPSIT , PEA test also Lund-Kennedy score record . Subjects `` non-improved '' arm ( regardless whether randomized receive nasal steroid ) additional ( research purpose ) head CT . This research head CT provide free charge Department Otolaryngology 's CT scanner . Medication diaries review assessed compliance concern side effect . These diary collect future review independent data safety reviewer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients otherwise healthy undergo surgery treatment chronic rhinosinusitis evaluate olfactory dysfunction , present , recruit study participation . The subject include without regard gender , race ethnicity . Subjects identify patient clinical practice Department Otolaryngology Head Neck Surgery University North Carolina . Only adult patient great 18 year old less 85 approach study , patient treatment algorithm outside range tend vary great frequency . Due limit resource , patient fluent English include , thus minimize confound variable hurdle patient communication , clinic interpret service . Also , quality life survey olfactory test non English version . Only patient health insurance include study order ensure participant access study drug . If patient premenopausal woman , ask pregnant breastfeeding . If either , exclude study . All remain woman receive urine pregnancy test . If urine pregnancy test positive , patient exclude study . Thus , premenopausal female patient , negative urine pregnancy test necessary inclusion study need repeat CTs possible systemic manifestation due steroid irrigation . Further exclusion criterion include follow : hypersensitivity cortisol , history pituitary disease , allergic disease subsequent anaphylaxis breathe difficulty . Additionally , patient history immunodeficiency , autoimmune disease , cystic fibrosis , previous sinus surgery exclude comorbidities might cloud relationship treatment outcome .</criteria>
