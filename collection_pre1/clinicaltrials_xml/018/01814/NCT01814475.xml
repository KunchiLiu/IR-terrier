	<brief_summary>This study perform prospective multicenter phase II trial compare busulfan-fludarabine reduced-intensity conditioning ( RIC ) thiotepa-fludarabine RIC regimen prior allogeneic transplantation hematopoietic cell treatment myelofibrosis . The primary endpoint study compare Progression Free Survival two different RIC regimens allogeneic stem cell transplantation myelofibrosis . Progression Free Survival define time date randomization date first document disease progression relapse ( accord International Working Group Consensus Criteria ) death due cause . Patients neither progress died time study completion lose follow-up censor data last follow progression disease study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This first study explore efficacy two different Reduced-intensity conditioning ( RIC ) regimens allogeneic stem cell transplantation myelofibrosis . The choice 60 patient base feasibility reason . GITMO data hand point estimate accrual twenty patient per year tree-year enrolment period . Criteria define sample size follow statistical power estimate order demonstrate difference lack two treatment . However , criterion reflect overall efficacy safety compare two treatment among patient require treatment within health system . This criterion offer best estimate power study . Myelofibrosis clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder clinically characterize progressive anemia , mark splenomegaly , extramedullary hematopoiesis , constitutional symptom significant risk evolution acute leukaemia myelofibrosis appear primitive idiopathic disorder , less frequently , secondary complication essential thrombocythemia polycythemia vera , clinical presentation course similar idiopathic form . The disease affect mainly elderly people , median age diagnosis 65 year . It heterogeneous disorder term presentation evolution , median overall survival ( OS ) vary 2 15 year , depend presence absence clinically define prognostic factor . Adverse prognostic factor survival include advanced age , mark anemia , leukocytosis leukopenia , abnormal karyotype , constitutional symptom presence circulate blast . Moreover , prognostic value cytogenetic abnormality , increase number circulate cluster differentiation 34 cell peripheral blood Janus kinase 2 mutational status also evaluate . The available prognostic score system mainly base clinical variable . The widely use 'Lille score ' ( Dupriez et al . ) base hemoglobin level leukocyte count . The Mayo Clinic Group try improve Lille score add thrombocytopenia monocytosis . The International Working Group Myelofibrosis Research Treatment recently propose new score system analyze large patient population recognize 5 main unfavourable variable : age &gt; 65 year , presence constitutional symptom , circulate blast cell ≥ 1 % , anemia leucocytosis . All prognostic system could clearly separate intermediate high risk patient ( median survival range 1 4 year ) patient favourable prognosis ( median survival 8-10 year ) . Kroger behalf European Group Blood Marrow Transplantation report data 104 patient mainly intermediate high risk score receive condition regimen base fludarabine 180 mg/mq busulfan 8 mg/kg i.v 10 mg/Kg p.o hematopoietic stem cell come sibling unrelated donor . Engraftment 99 % ; 1-year transplant-related mortality 16 % significantly increase patient old 50 year , case intermediate high-risk myelofibrosis transplant mismatch donor . Five-year overall survival 67 % 5 -year event-free-survival 51 % . Relapse rate high splenectomized patient disease duration prior transplant &gt; 24 month . Moreover , Kroger report condition regimen induce Janus kinase 2 negativity 78 % patient carry V617-JAK2 mutation transplant produce rapid regression bone marrow fibrosis 59 % patient al day +100 100 % patient day +360 . At present , busulfan-fludarabine regimen could consider Reduced-intensity condition regimen test large patient population demonstrate best result term feasibility clinical , molecular histological response . The Principal Investigator recently report data population 100 patient myelofibrosis underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 26 transplant center part GITMO 20-year period 1986 2006 retrospectively analyzed influence patient disease clinical feature stem cell transplantation transplant procedures transplant-related mortality ( TRM ) overall survival . We confirm myelofibrosis remain rare indication stem cell transplantation recruitment 15-17 case per year since 2002 observe great heterogeneity term condition regimen , Graft versus Host Disease prophylaxis supportive measure . Although observed significative progressive improvement transplant-related mortality 1996 , could n't recognize significative difference outcome either patient treat myeloablative versus reduced- intensity regimens among treated different Reduced-intensity conditioning regimen . The lack association intensity condition type drug include preparative regimen could part due great heterogeneity transplant procedure . However , show regimen include thiotepa administer 24 52 patient ( 46 % ) , whereas patient receive heterogeneous preparative regimen . The combination thiotepa cyclophosphamide originally describe autologous transplant ; thiotepa use 30 % dose reduction Reduced-intensity conditioning regimen association Cyclophosphamide and/or fludarabine follow haematopoietic stem cell elderly patient acute leukemia , heavily pretreated relapsed refractory lymphomas myelodysplastic syndrome , show highly feasible effective . Both protocol use Italy researcher physician participate GITMO . In conclusion , rational present study follow : - myelofibrosis rare indication allogeneic transplantation limit number patient recruitable whole Italian region . - At present time available sufficient data support standard condition regimen patient . - Italian hematologist group GITMO intend overcome general uncertainty choice condition regimen test prospectively control study uniform strategy transplant procedure rare condition . - Therefore , want compare two Reduced-intensity conditioning regimen , thiotepa-fludarabine regimen , common one use Italy last 5 year , busulfan-fludarabine one , report literature achieve best result term feasibility clinical response . A randomized comparison likely increase knowledge safety efficacy condition regimen consolidate assumption plan phase II trial .</detailed_description>
