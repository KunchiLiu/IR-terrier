	<detailed_description>This study randomize ( study drug assign chance ) , multicenter ( 1 hospital medical school team work medical research study ) , active-controlled , parallel group ( group participant treat time ) , double-blind ( neither physician participant know treatment participant receives ) study . The duration treatment 2 day conduct 4 period : screening period ( 33 2 day study drug administration first surgical incision ) , surgical period ( 1 day study drug administration ) , qualification period ( 1 day ) double-blind treatment period ( 1 2 day ) . Participants randomly assign 2 group : study drug treatment group ( ER ) comparator treatment group ( IR ) . Participants administer 2 tablet ER tramadol HCl ( 75 milligram [ mg ] ) /acetaminophen ( 650 mg ) along 2 tablet placebo match IR tramadol HCl/acetaminophen study drug treatment group ; 2 tablet IR tramadol HCl ( 37.5 mg ) /acetaminophen ( 325 mg ) along 2 tablet placebo match ER tramadol HCl/acetaminophen comparator treatment group respectively 0 , 12 , 24 36 hour . Participants also administer 2 tablet placebo match IR tramadol HCl/acetaminophen study drug treatment group ; 2 tablet IR tramadol HCl/acetaminophen comparator treatment group respectively 6 , 18 , 30 42 hour . Participants administer investigational product 6-hour interval time first investigational product administration 48 hour . Efficacy assess use 11-point numeric rating scale ( NRS ) . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
