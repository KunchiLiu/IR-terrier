	<brief_summary>Probenecid FDA approve drug treatment gout hyperuricemia . It use safely humans decade indication . The investigator recently discover drug also stimulate receptor heart therefore improve function . The hypothesis study probenecid use improve function heart therefore symptom patient heart failure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Repurposing Probenecid Positive Inotrope Treatment Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator test hypothesis oral administration probenecid result improve symptomatology heart function patient systolic heart failure . There three cohort . Cohort 1 enroll 50 subject double-blinded , randomize , placebo-control , cross-over study patient serve control . The subject stable HF , ejection fraction less equal 40 % NYHA II IV symptom . Each subject undergo 1 week investigational product ( IP ) , consist oral probenecid therapy 1 gram twice day placebo weekly follow . The subject undergo EKGs , laboratory analysis , physical exam ; dyspnea quality life questionnaires 6 minute walk test ( MWT ) baseline . There 2 optional sub-studies one echocardiographic data biomarkers . Cohort 2 enroll 50 subject double-blinded , randomize , placebo-control study include patient admitted hospital acute decompensated HF . Each subject also receive Investigational product consist either 1 gram orally twice daily probenecid placebo hospitalization . They daily follow-up EKG appropriate laboratory work . In addition EKG , laboratory analysis , physical exam , dyspnea quality life questionnaires 6 MWT data collect ; additional data length hospital stay , biomarkers , use inotropic therapy diuretic , rate diuresis also collect . Cohort 3 enroll 50 healthy subject double-blinded , randomize , placebo-control study . Each subject also receive Investigational product consist either 2 gram orally probenecid placebo . During 6 hour course subject laboratory analysis , physical exam , telemetry , EKG echocardiographic study perform measure safety effect compound .</detailed_description>
