	<detailed_description>As prevalence obesity United States rise , prevalence type 2 diabetes , disease typically associate adult . The American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) recommend screen child 10 year age older substantial risk presence development type 2 diabetes . They also recommend primary prevention effort , lifestyle modification , direct high-risk child whose glucose level elevate yet diagnostic diabetes . The choice screen methodology remain controversial implementation within pediatric primary care set far ideal . The purpose study implement ADA screen guideline type 2 diabetes within pediatric primary care practice use computer decision support system ( CDSS ) develop investigator research group - Child Health Improvement Computer Automation ( CHICA ) system . Using CHICA system investigator also implement clinical management prompt pediatrician care child risk factor type 2 diabetes , impair fast glucose ( IFG ) , fast glucose indicate possibility diabetes . One great strength CHICA system ability implement evidence-based recommendation authoritative source , case ADA , format integrates easily routine pediatric care ; system therefore overcome many barrier describe pediatrician screen type 2 diabetes child . While use CDSS new , application within pediatric population pervasive adult medicine . Moreover , application CDSS screening , diagnosis management type 2 diabetes child relatively unexplored . The specific aim study : ( 1 ) Expand modify exist computer-based decision support system ( CHICA ) , identify child 10 year age old increase risk type 2 diabetes , provide pediatric physician guideline screen type 2 diabetes , coordinate diagnosis long-term management condition ( 2 ) Demonstrate feasibility effectiveness CHICA Type 2 Diabetes Module recognize child need screen type 2 diabetes facilitate prompt diagnosis management condition . Phase one ( Aim 1 ) focus program enhancement CHICA system take 12 month complete . Phase two consist randomize controlled trial conduct four pediatric clinic order evaluate Aim 2 . Randomization clinic investigator hypothesize couple CDSS ADA guideline result great compliance ADA recommend screening procedure well well clinical management child identify pre-diabetes type 2 diabetes . Phase two begin year 2 continue quarter 2 year 4 . Phase three involve statistical analysis manuscript preparation .</detailed_description>
