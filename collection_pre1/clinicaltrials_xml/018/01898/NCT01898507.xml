	<brief_summary>This study examine effect smoke low nicotine cigarette different group smoker . The investigator focus difference smoker ' body break eliminate nicotine system . Some people fast metabolizers nicotine , mean break eliminate nicotine body quickly . Other people slower metabolizers mean break eliminate nicotine slowly . The investigator compare two group smoker response low nicotine cigarette . The investigator hypothesize individual smoke low nicotine cigarette may smoke intensely smoke day , thereby maintain desire nicotine level , result continue expose significant toxin level .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study examine effect smoke low nicotine cigarette smoke behavior toxin exposure fast slow nicotine metabolize smoker . We recruit current smoker ( split slow rapid nicotine metabolize smoker ) 35-day protocol . Participants smoke brand cigarette baseline 5 day period , follow 15-day period smoke low nicotine content cigarette level 1 : 0.25 mg nicotine content , follow 15-day period smoke low nicotine content cigarette level 2 : 0.08 mg nicotine content . This application design provide empirical science inform FDA effect smoke low nicotine content cigarette use pattern harm exposure .</detailed_description>
