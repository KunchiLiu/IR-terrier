	<brief_summary>The eye contain lens focus light . A clouding lens know cataract . Cataracts decrease vision . The treatment cataracts cataract surgery . Cataract surgery one commonly perform surgical procedure . Although rare , complication cataract surgery significant give number people surgery year serious complication may significant impact vision quality patient . Endophthalmitis infection eye one bad complication cataract surgery . Most infection cause bacteria patient 's skin conjunctiva , make clean skin eye surgery important . Before cataract surgery , patient receive umber eye drop ; many surgical center combination medication thick gel , medication remain eye long period time , may improve effect . Laboratory study suggest antibacterial effect clean solution may inhibit gel proven , many believe untrue . This study compare amount bacteria eye prior surgery patient receive gel formulation medication surgery compare receive medication eye drop ( liquid ) form .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Effectiveness Povidone-iodine Reducing Conjunctival Bacterial Load Prior Cataract Surgery Patients Treated With Lidocaine Gel Dilating Formulation Versus Eye Drops : A Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The human eye contains crystalline lens focus light onto retina . A clouding lens know cataract . Cataracts progressively decrease visual acuity contrast sensitivity . Cataracts lead cause blindness worldwide . The current standard practice treat cataract cataract extraction use phacoemulsification , ultrasound technology liquefy aspirate lens material , implantation intraocular lens ( IOL ) clearly refocus light onto retina . Cataract surgery one commonly perform surgical procedure . Although rare , complication cataract surgery significant give number people surgery year serious complication may significant impact vision quality life patient . Endophthalmitis intraocular inflammation involve anterior posterior segment eye attributable bacterial fungal pathogen . Postoperative endophthalmitis one devastating complication cataract surgery despite aggressive treatment , approximately half patient achieve good 20/40 vision many patient remain light perception ( NLP ) . The majority causative organisms patient 's skin conjunctival flora , make preoperative reduction conjunctival flora key component endophthalmitis prophylaxis . The Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study ( EVS ) reveal 70 % infection due coagulase-negative Staphylococcus , 9.9 % due Staphylococcus aureus , 2.2 % Enterococcus , 5.9 % Gram-negative bacteria . A recent systematic review evidence postoperative endophthalmitis rate 0.265 % 2000 2003 , compare 0.087 % previous decade . There numerous theory increase incidence , include move topical anaesthesia change wound construction technique . It difficult prospective study detect difference rate endophthalmitis incidence low . Currently , topical povidone-iodine intracameral antibiotic ( cefuroxime , vancomycin , moxifloxacin ) show decrease rate endophthalmitis . Prior cataract surgery preoperative area , patient receive number eye drop , frequently include antibiotic , corticosteroid , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( NSAIDs ) , anaesthetics mydriatics/cycloplegics . Many surgical centre , include Regional Eye Institute St. Joseph 's Centre Ambulatory Care pharmacy-prepared combination medication viscous gel , medication remain ocular surface prolong period time thus enhance efficacy . Topical lidocaine gel anaesthetic use prior cataract surgery many institutions.Studies demonstrate antiseptic effect topical povidone-iodine may inhibit topical lidocaine gel publish . Boden et al . perform basic science study inoculate culture medium bacteria expose topical lidocaine gel , topical povidone-iodine topical povidone-iodine lidocaine gel . Their result reveal antiseptic effect povidone-iodine inhibit previous treatment lidocaine gel . Moreover , retrospective observational case series find 2 7 case postoperative endophthalmitis occur topical lidocaine gel use . Most recently , Doshi et al . laboratory set confirmed inhibitory effect lidocaine gel prior povidone-iodine also reveal povidone-iodine applied prior lidocaine gel , iodine able act antiseptic usual . The previous study reveal may inhibition antiseptic effect povidone-iodine topical lidocaine gel apply first laboratory setting . This show clinically .</detailed_description>
