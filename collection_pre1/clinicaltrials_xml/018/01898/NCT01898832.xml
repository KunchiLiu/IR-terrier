	<brief_title>Il-17 Levels Intrahepatic Cholestasis Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intrahepatic cholestasis pregnancy ( ICP ) prevalent pregnancy-specific liver disease . It occur mainly second third trimester pregnancy . It typically resolve delivery spontaneously associate increase risk adverse fetal outcome . The cause ICP heterogeneous , pathophysiology poorly understood therapy empiric . Genetic predisposition , environmental influence , dietary factor hormonal influence study cited literature . Comparing placebo , ursodeoxycholic acid ( UDCA ) show improvement treatment pruritus previous study . S-adenosylmethionine , guar gum , activate charcoal , dexamethasone , cholestyramine , etc . effective treatment symptom . CD4+ T cell essential regulator immune response inflammatory disease . They also call chief orchestra cell immune system . The balance T helper- ( Th ) 1 , Th-2 Th-17 cell cytokinergic interaction crucial response organism . Th17 specific cytokine IL-17 responsible pathogenesis autoimmune diseases autoimmune uveitis , experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis animal model potentially also human autoimmune diseases multiple sclerosis , Crohn 's disease , rheumatoid arthritis , psoriasis , primary biliary cirrhosis . Recently , IL-17 target therapy ( secukinumab , ixekizumab brodalumab ) study Phase III clinical trial evaluate overall efficacy safety certain autoimmune disease . Th-17 level investigate normal abnormal pregnancy result incompatible . Some researcher say level IL-17 increase pregnancy others . Low serum IL-17 associated premature birth . Up-regulation IL-17 associate preeclampsia . K. Harada et . ( 2009 ) demonstrate IL-17-positive cell associate chronic inflammation bile duct primary biliary cirrhosis ( PBC ) . Also , author demonstrate Th-17-related cytokine increase significantly patient PBC . Maho Ichikawa et . present case male newborn infant show progressive severe cholestasis selectively high Levels Serum IL- 17 . Based information , decide investigate maternal fetal serum IL-17 level pregnants ICP effect UDCA therapy find Th-17 cell role progress ICP .</detailed_description>
