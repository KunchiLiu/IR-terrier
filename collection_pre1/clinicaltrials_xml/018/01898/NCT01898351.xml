	<detailed_description>Background Recent scientific evidence suggest diet largely base plant food , well-balanced vegetarian diet , potential improve health , contrast predominantly meat-based diet . However , many consumer may wish exclude meat diet , despite current advice reduce , particular , processed meat . One way achieve increase consumption plant-based protein component diet . Making comparison nutritional content high protein plant ( i.e . &gt; 20 g protein/100 g dry weight ) , several candidate source identify . In particular , belong Fabaceae family include pulse ( green pea , fava bean , lupin seed ) certain common bean specie . Species plant family Fabaceae generally less protein . An exception hemp seed ( Cannabaceae family ) , protein content around 40g protein /100g dry weight , source fibre , favourable fatty acid amino acid profile . Other family interest include Amaranthaceae specie ( Quinoa ) , Polygonaceae ( Buckwheat ) Poaceae ( Wheat , Barley Oats ) . Protein content pseudocereal cereal crop range 12-20 g protein /100 g dry weight . Although low protein content compare Fabaceae specie , generally rich fibre consequently impart additional benefit high-protein plant base diet . According Scottish Health Survey ( 2009 ) , nearly two-thirds men ( 66.3 % ) approximately half woman ( 58.4 % ) overweight . Obesity major risk factor metabolic syndrome , link condition type II diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . Having impair glucose tolerance double chance morbidity mortality cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . CVD lead cause death account nearly 30 % death worldwide year . Clinical study show regular consumption pulse reduce blood level total cholesterol low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) . The recent meta-analysis randomize controlled trial provide strong evidence date non-soya legume consumption lower serum total LDL cholesterol therefore , may lower risk CVD . Eating pulse regularly may also lower CVD risk via favorable effect blood pressure , blood glucose insulin level satisfy hunger help manage body weight . Higher legume intake associate low body mass index ( BMI ) , blood pressure , serum total cholesterol ( TC ) low incidence T2DM , compare low legume intake . In addition achieve energy balance improve overall diet , World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommend people increase consumption legume ( pulse ) , well vegetable , wholegrain nut prevent obesity . There seem differential effect pea-protein compare meat dairy proteins fed similar amount pre-load . Technically nut , hempseed typically contain 30 % oil 25 % protein , considerable amount dietary fibre , vitamins mineral . The two main protein hempseed edestin albumin ( high-quality storage protein easily digest contain nutritionally significant amount essential amino acid ) ; hempseed exceptionally high level amino acid arginine . Hempseed excellent source nutrition use treat various disorder thousand year traditional medicine . Animal study human study ( hemp seed oil ) agree well hempseed health promote property ; support result nutritional analysis seed , oil seed meal . Being rich source polyunsaturated fatty acid protein contain essential amino acid nutritionally sufficient amount detail FAO/WHO ( Food Agriculture Organization United Nations/World Health Organization ) suggest requirement infant child . Hemp proteins Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score ( PDCAAS ) equal great certain grain , nut , pulse . Hempseed , addition nutritional value , demonstrate positive health benefit , include lower cholesterol high blood pressure . Buckwheat attract increase attention food scientist potential beneficial effect chronic disease . In early 1970 's nutritional property buckwheat first demonstrate . The cholesterol lower effect buckwheat protein extract rat cholesterol-enriched diet report . There much research conduct functionality property buckwheat protein phytochemical buckwheat seed . Among , promise flavone , flavonoid , phytosterols , fagopyrins , thiamin-binding protein . Buckwheat proteins unique amino acid composition Experiments , animal model human study reveal buckwheat flour improve T2DM , obesity , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia constipation . For social science element project , propose study employ qualitative research method emphasise importance 'lay ' knowledge subjective experience research participant . Within field nutrition research , qualitative method technique still remain comparatively rare . This partly privilege status quantitative research , also length time amount effort go qualitative study small pool qualify researcher field .As qualitative research effort require researcher seek understand people social cultural context live participant ' point view , type knowledge much contribute understand people eat . For purpose study , qualitative method enhance understanding acceptability , consumer Scotland , food base sustainable , plant-based protein . It also tell u much barrier exist uptake food , consumer perspective . Planned work study From health perspective essential establish bioavailability metabolism plant proteins dietary constituent human . Certain metabolites absorb early gastrointestinal tract , whereas others transport colon extensively metabolize gut microbiota . In acute study , characterise bioactive metabolite present urine plasma sample obtain . This inform availability systemic circulation , well excretion profile . We employ targeted quantitative analysis use LC-MS GC-MS provide identity metabolites vivo concentration . We focus metabolite consider impact human health . The principal metabolite analyse produce phenylpropanoid pathway product protein carbohydrate metabolism . These include derivative metabolite simple phenol , benzoic acid , phenolic acid , phenylacetic acid , phenypropionic acid , phenylpyruvic acid , phenyllactic acid , mandellic acid , phenolic dimer , acetophenones , benzaldehydes , cinnamaldehydes , benzyl alcohol , cinnamyl alcohol , indoles , isoflavones , coumarins , chalcones , flavanones , flavone , flavonols , anthocyanidins . We also show many compound bioactive exhibit anti-oxidant anti-inflammatory activity vivo concentration . These study provide important information bioavailability metabolism , also allow u correlate index biomarkers health . In study also examine effect different protein source post-prandial effect , endocrine response ( e.g . PYY ( peptide YY ) level ) hunger rating . The energy intake volunteer measure lunch ( ad libitum ) intervention day . Volunteer view acceptability towards diet rich plant protein assess . Some component pulse may contribute weight control inhibit intestinal absorption carbohydrates energy yield nutrient protein . Correlating metabolic profile biomarkers health provide information feed back agricultural practice optimise crop breeding strategy benefit human health . With regard social science component project , in-depth semi-structured interview use . The term 'semi-structured ' reflect intrinsic flexibility qualitative interview approach , often use aide-memoire interview guide rather formal schedule . In addition , form content research question likely vary , response particular interview context . This type built-in design strengthen qualitative research attentiveness context . All interview digitally record fully transcribe . The qualitative analytical technique apply look examine theme pattern mean within kind data generate research mode . The interviews conversation take place part qualitative inquiry generate response , perception , opinion research participant . These understood constituting 'discourse ' ( set idea ) derive focus inquiry lend particularly well thematic analysis . Themes derive process know 'coding ' ( label ) specific chunk text accord idea seem represent . This interpretative work involve creation analytical theme researcher particularly useful bring together 'insider ' 'emic ' perspective derive research participant 's knowledge experience , 'outsider ' 'etic ' perspective researcher relevant literature . Patterns data thus identify intellectual work bring together component fragment idea , perception experience might meaningless consider isolation . The researcher engage thematic analysis seek understand different idea component fit together meaningful way , order produce coherent analytical account . The analysis validate refer back relevant literature , may support ( counter ) inference draw researcher . The interweave research finding extant research literature help strengthen interpretive account provide researcher . Research participant also engage process feedback emerge pattern seek . This process member check conduct course interview . Through analytical framework focus discourse acknowledges importance participant ' perspective experience , analysis present contextualised exploration way consumer perceive plant-based protein alternative supplement meat .</detailed_description>
