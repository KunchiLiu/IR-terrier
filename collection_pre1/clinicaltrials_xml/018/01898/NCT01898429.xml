	<brief_title>Deep Brain Stimulation ( DBS ) Treatment-Resistant Depression ( TRD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The U.S. lifetime prevalence major depressive disorder ( MDD ) 17 % . A number treatment available depression include medication , psychotherapy various somatic treatment . Unfortunately , two-thirds patient remain symptomatic follow first-line treatment third fail achieve remission ( define full resolution depressive symptom ) four establish treatment ; approximately 10 % -20 % depressed patient may show virtually improvement despite multiple , often aggressive treatment . Thus , conservative estimate place U.S. prevalence treatment-resistant depression ( TRD ) 1 % -3 % . TRD high risk suicide , major cause disability responsible double overall health care cost . For patient TRD limit evidence-based treatment option . Transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) may efficacy patient fail one antidepressant medication 10-12 , response remission rate relatively low ( 30 % 20 % respectively ) . Vagus nerve stimulation ( VNS ) may efficacy patient fail 4-6 antidepressant treatment long-term response remission rate low ( 20 % 10 % respectively ) . Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) effective TRD patient remission rate 50 % -60 % . However , 70 % TRD patient relapse within 6 month follow successful acute treatment course . For patient fail ECT , evidence-based treatment option . Therefore , great need novel treatment approach TRD . Prior clinical trial show SCC DBS potential valuable treatment option patient TRD . Further develop treatment involve confirm effectiveness identify way optimize use . In study intend test safety efficacy chronic SCC DBS treatment TRD compare safety efficacy left-sided versus right-sided stimulation use double-blind , randomize , cross-over design .</detailed_description>
