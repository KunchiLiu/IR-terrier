	<brief_summary>Craniosynostosis birth defect cause bone baby 's head fuse together earlier normal . This cause baby abnormally shape head . These child operate prevent treat increase pressure brain , allow normal development . There good evidence child craniosynostosis increase pressure brain . Up twenty patient craniofacial abnormality enrol pilot study . The investigator use magnetic resonance scanner obtain several measure brain metabolism . The investigator also obtain data marker developmental delay . The result also compare age gender match data child without craniofacial abnormality . There study hypothesis patient craniofacial abnormality associate intracranial pressure decrease metabolic activity compare control patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The incidence craniosynostosis report 1/2,000 birth . Craniosynostosis birth defect cause one suture baby 's head close earlier normal . The skull infant young child make bony plate allow growth skull . The border plate intersect call suture suture line . Early closing suture cause baby abnormally shape head . Original contribution Dr. Paul Tessier along technological advance ( improve pediatric anesthesia , rigid fixation , resorbable plate , endoscopic technique distraction ) significantly advanced surgical treatment patient past 40 year . Primary indication operative treatment patient craniosynostosis prevent treat increase intracranial pressure ( ICP ) avoid neurological impairment . Increased ICP think result restrict space brain growth cause decrease cranial vault volume . A secondary surgical indication normalization head shape cosmetic purpose . Literature limit relationship craniosynostosis ICP . The widely report study Renier colleague . In 75 patient preoperative ICP monitoring perform use epidural sensor . They identify ICP normal one-third case , obviously elevate one-third , borderline one-third . When counsel patient , practitioner report 13 % rate increase ICP single suture synostosis 42 % multiple suture synostosis . However , author use adult normative value ICP ( normal less 10mmHg elevate great 15mmHg ) . Normal ICP child infant identify closer 6 mmHg . Due invasiveness test , preoperative ICP monitoring routinely perform decide operative repair require . Other indirect sign increase intracranial pressure describe ( e.g. , copper beaten appearance skull plain film , papilledema , compare intracranial volume normative data ) , reliable . Currently , standard care surgically treat patient craniosynostosis . While currently feasible measure ICP directly , may able indirectly study effect growth restriction brain development . Metabolic consequence direct mechanical stress global cerebral ischemia craniosynostosis describe . We aim evaluate prevalence metabolic defect craniosynostosis patient use magnetic resonance ( MR ) image technique . Up twenty patient craniosynostosis abnormality hydrocephaly associate increased cranial pressure enrol pilot study . The investigator obtain several measure cerebral metabolism preoperatively . MR spectroscopy ( MRS ) use obtain concentration N-acetyl aspartate ( NAA ) lactate . NAA highly sensitive marker brain injury presence lactate indicate compromise metabolism . We measure whole-brain oxygen extraction ( OEF ) use magnetic field mapping approach . Elevated OEF key indicator compromise perfusion . Cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) measure use arterial spin labeling ( ASL ) sequence , allow direct measurement perfusion deficiency . We also obtain functional connectivity data use rfcMRI sequence , sensitive developmental delay . Finally , scanner sequence measure CSF flow marker intracranial pressure also perform . The result also compare deidentified age gender match normative data . These control recruit plastic surgery clinic and/or deidentified data normal subject another study use . The analysis OEF ASL data perform Dr. Dustin Ragan Dr. McKinstry Washington University St. Louis .</detailed_description>
