	<detailed_description>Clinical trial cell therapy PD patient first perform Lund late 1980s , follow number similar , small trial European North American centre . These initial study perform small group advance PD patient open label firmly establish safety procedure . The result obtain trial show grafted dopaminergic [ DA ] neuron survive function long-term , 10 year , patient show clear clinical benefit , especially respect bradykinesia rigidity , reduction L-dopa requirement . Using functional imaging also show graft DA neuron restore striatal DA release provide sustain re-activation motor cortical area , i.e . key area underactive prior grafting . Post-mortem study show excellent long-term survival graft DA neuron , notwithstanding observation long-term surviving transplant ( 12-15 year graft ) show contain sign PD-related pathology , i.e . neuronal Lewy-bodies alpha-synuclein positive inclusion graft . However , change observe patient see extent pathology limit small number graft DA cell clinical consequence , , know . However , outcomes two NIH sponsor double blind placebo control trial , publish main finding 2001 2003 , raise major concern . In trial graft patient show significant improvement overall compare sham-operated control 1 2 year post graft . Furthermore , significant number patient trial develop GIDs , case severe neurosurgery need remedy situation . The reason variable , overall poor , outcome trial , include generation GIDs , subject much debate recently centre three key element , additional possible fourth element : - The selection patient term clinical phenotype , disease stage pattern striatal dopaminergic denervation time graft ; - The difference immunosuppressive regime risk incomplete immunosuppression combination use solid graft method may lead development detrimental immune/inflammatory reaction graft site compromise graft dopamine cell function ; - The mode engraftment difference graft cell survival , risk inhomogeneous delivery dopaminergic neuron generation potentially dyskinesia-inducing `` patchy '' innervation host striatum ; - A final possible element composition graft tissue ratio serotoninergic dopaminergic neuron within graft . There emerge evidence serotoninergic neuron release dopamine relatively unregulated fashion give lack transporter , may use L-dopa false transmitter may underlie development L-dopa induce dyskinesia 's may also contribute GIDs . Failure NIH trial demonstrate overall clinical benefit graft patient , unexpected worrisome development GIDs significant number patient trial represent major hurdle future development cell base therapy PD relate area project seek move field forward go beyond current state art treatment approach . This project gather together available expertise area resolve reduce risk previous complication see VM transplant patient PD . We conduct new round clinical trial , involve step-by-step optimisation technical aspect graft procedure patient selection assessment , order improve clinical efficiency consistency , absence troublesome dyskinesia 's .</detailed_description>
