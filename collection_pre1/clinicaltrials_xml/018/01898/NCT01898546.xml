	<brief_summary>Objectives . We evaluate effect ischemic postconditioning ( PCON ) microvascular obstruction ( MVO ) patient first ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) treat primary angioplasty . Background . PCON appear potentially beneficial tool STEMI . Its impact MVO unknown . Methods . In multicenter study , 132 patient first STEMI randomize undergo primary angioplasty follow PCON primary angioplasty alone ( non-PCON ) . MVO infarct size ( IS ) quantify ( % leave ventricular mass ) core laboratory analyze late enhancement cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ischemic Postconditioning Microvascular Obstruction Reperfused Myocardial Infarction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION In ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) timely coronary reperfusion primary therapeutic goal improve patient ' outcome reduce leave ventricular ( LV ) infarct size ( IS ) . Unfortunately , despite successful reperfusion epicardial blood flow impairment microvascular perfusion persist significant number patient , phenomenon refer microvascular obstruction ( MVO ) . This multifactorial process cause , among factor , microembolization , vasospasm cell plug . Cell reperfusion injury relate inflammation well mitochondrial damage provoke rapid normalization acidotic myocardial environment play key role pathophysiology MVO . In recent year MVO demonstrate powerful independent predictor adverse outcome large IS . Cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging ( CMR ) become state art technique early non-invasive comprehensive assessment structural consequence STEMI , include MVO . Availability inexpensive easy-to-implement therapy could solidly reduce MVO subsequently optimize beneficial effect prompt primary percutaneous intervention would utmost importance . In recent year ischemic postconditioning ( PCON ) appear promising option . It permit progressive , rather brisk , restoration blood flow jeopardize myocardium mean consecutive cycle inflation deflation angioplasty balloon use open acute coronary occlusion . Previous experimental evidence preliminary clinical data suggest simple strategy exerts , comparison traditional rapid reperfusion use single balloon inflation , number protective myocardial effect . During last two year effect PCON CMR-derived infarct size STEMI patient evaluate result controversial . In routine practice , time window achieve additional reduction IS beyond derive timely coronary reperfusion extremely tight . To contrary , MVO owe pathophysiology progressive time course , seem suitable realistic objective explore impact complementary therapy . Nevertheless effect PCON MVO STEMI unknown far . In present study aim analyse effect PCON CMR-derived MVO randomize series patient first STEMI treat primary angioplasty . METHODS Study group patient : Patients age ≥18 year admit two university hospital first STEMI within first 12 h chest pain onset , ST-segment elevation &gt; 0.1 mV least 2 contiguous lead clinical decision treat percutaneous coronary intervention make , consider inclusion . The exclusion criterion follow : documented history previous infarction ; primary percutaneous revascularization attempt ; severe clinical hemodynamic deterioration ; leave main stem disease ; Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction ( TIMI ) 2-3 Rentrop collateral flow grade ≥1 upon patient arrival ; death , re-infarction , cardiac surgery severe clinical deterioration CMR study ; patient deny participation registry ; contraindication CMR . The institutional ethic committee participate institution approve research protocol write informed consent obtain subject . The study conduct accordance Declaration Helsinki . Reperfusion therapy patient : STEMI patient admit institution participate present study randomly allocate either PCON non-PCON group . Randomization perform use computer-generated randomization sequence . In summary , diagnostic coronary angiography carry decision undertake primary angioplasty make , operator acceed personal code web page specifically develop present study ( Universitat Politecnica , Valencia , Spain ) patient record , , study group assignment obtain . Baseline characteristic , clinical data TIMI risk score prospectively record case . The percentage sum ST-segment resolution 90 min reperfusion therapy determine . Times upper reference limit ( xURL ) creatine-kinase MB mass serially measure upon patient arrival 6 , 12 , 24 48 h reperfusion peak value record . CMR study patient : CMR ( 1.5-T , Sonata Magnetom , Siemens , Erlangen , Germany ) perform 1 week STEMI accord laboratory protocol . All image acquire phased-array body surface coil breath-holds ECG-triggered . CMR study analyze core lab ( INCLIVA , Valencia , Spain ) experience observer blind patient data use customized software ( QMASS MR , 6.1.5 , Medis , Leiden , The Netherlands ) . In cine imaging , LV ejection fraction ( % ) , end-diastolic end-systolic volume index ( ml/m2 ) mass ( g/m² ) calculate manual planimetry endocardial epicardial border short-axis view ( Figure 2 ) . MVO visually define lack contrast uptake core tissue show late gadolinium enhancement ( Figure 2 ) ; extent MVO manually define express percentage LV mass . In order avoid artifact base prognostic value previously demonstrate study group , significant MVO consider present detect one segment use 17-segment model . The intra-observer variability quantification expose CMR parameter core lab previously determine less 5 % . Endpoint : The primary endpoint present study assess effect PCON occurrence extent MVO STEMI patient treat primary angioplasty . The secondary endpoint explore , scenario , effect PCON IS . Statistical analysis : The target sample size calculate assess effect PCON occurrence MVO measure CMR image . The expected effect 50 % reduction occurrence MVO statistical power 80 % probability type I error 0.05 2-sided test . Assuming drop-out rate 25 % , total sample consist 98 patient randomize equally two group . For security reason randomize 132 patient . Continuous variable test normal distribution use one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test . Continuous normally distribute data express mean ± standard deviation compare use Student 's t-test . Non-parametric data express median interquartile range compare Mann-Whitney U-test . Group percentages compare use chi-square test Fisher 's exact test appropriate . Statistical significance consider two-tailed p &lt; 0.05 . SPSS 11.0 ( SPSS Inc , Chicago , Illinois , USA ) use throughout .</detailed_description>
