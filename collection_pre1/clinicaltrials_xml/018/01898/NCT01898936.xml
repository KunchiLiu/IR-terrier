	<detailed_description>Protocol study : `` A randomized half-side comparative trial fractional laser-assisted daylight photodynamic therapy versus daylight photodynamic therapy organ transplant recipient multiple actinic keratoses scalp forehead '' Organ transplant recipient ( OTR ) increase risk non-melanoma skin cancer , particular squamous cell carcinoma ( SCC ) , often develop area field cancerization , area multiple precancerous actinic keratoses . The risk develop SCC OTR 65-100-fold normal population ( Jensen 1999 , Lindeløf 2000 ) , cancer often run aggressive course metastasis report occur 5-8 % case ( Berg 2002 ) . The treatment option field cancerization limit . In Norway , register treatment alternative topical immune response modifier imiquimod photodynamic treatment . Neither treatment show long term beneficial effect . Photodynamic treatment ( PDT ) treatment selectively target abnormal cell , radical oxygen specie ( ROS ) generate photosensitizers activate visible light . Activation light perform lamp ( LED lamp ) daylight . Daylight-PDT show less painful PDT perform lamp ( Wiegell 2008 ) . The photosensitizer apply directly skin surface careful removal hyperkeratosis . PDT show effective treat epithelial dysplasia immunocompetent population , clearance rate 71-100 % facial scalp keratosis , 44-73 % acral site ( Morton 2002 ) . The less effectiveness extremity possibly due hyperkeratosis extremity le absorption cream . PDT show less effective transplant population compare non-immunosuppressed ( Dragieva 2004 , Morton 2008 ) . The reason likely multifactorial , thickness hyperkeratotic layer regard important factor . In animal model well human , show fluorescence measurement ablative fractional laser treatment facilitate delivery photosensitize cream deeply skin ( Haedersdal 2010 , Togsverd-Bo 2012 ) . The laser ablate columns skin , facilitate penetration thereby increase absorption drug deeper layer . In study , study effect pre-treating skin ablative , fractional carbondioxide laser PDT group OTR multiple actinic keratoses . Two symmetrical area scalp forehead randomize one side allocate receive fractional ablative carbondioxide laser treatment . Both symmetrical area receive daylight PDT . The primary endpoint comparison fraction lesion complete response treatment ( CR ) . Secondary endpoint grade treatment response adverse effect treatment ; acute ( pain ) long-term ( scar pigmentary change ) . The patient evaluate 4 12 month treatment procedure . For detailed description procedure , see . Study design : This randomize , two-treatment half-side comparative study daylight PDT without ablative fractional carbondioxide laser blind treatment assessment . The study compare efficacy tolerability one treatment fractional laser assist daylight-PDT versus daylight-PDT treat multiple actinic keratoses two symmetrical area scalp forehead organ transplant recipient . The patient pre-treated removal thick keratoses ( grade 2 3 ) side scalp forehead one week randomization treatment . After randomization , one side allocate treatment ablative fractional carbondioxide laser daylight PDT ; side receive daylight-PDT . Pain evaluate VAS score 2 hour daylight , patient instruct repeat score evaluate pain treatment area successive day treatment , report contact phone one week . Patient population : 15 OTR Randomization procedure : Randomization perform immediately fractional laser procedure computer generate list allocation conceal draw lot seal , opaque envelope Treatment procedure : After write informed consent patient offer removal superficial hyperkeratosis curettage and/or keratolytic cream one week inclusion study . Two symmetrical treatment area either scalp forehead mark pen , photograph long hair cut treatment area . Actinic keratoses register graded accord Olsen ( Olsen 1991 ) . Treatment area cover plastic mark area treat keratotic lesion ( grade ) . The plastic saved/transferred paper save . The treatment field treatment perform 30 W Lutronic carbondioxide laser ; cover one symmetrical treatment area allocate fractional carbondioxide laser . The laser setting follow : The fluence initially 10mJ/cm2 deliver 120 micron tip ( produce 120 micron ablative column ) 5 % density . The fluence increase patient experience pain ( pain indicate penetration dermis ) , reduce maximum fluence without pain . Allocation laser therapy blind future evaluator . The PDT procedure include application Metvix cream skin symmetrical area thickness approximately 1 mm , plastic cover 30 minute enter daylight 2 hour . The treatment procedure produce skin barrier defect , patient receive systemically administer antibiotic treatment day additional 4 day total 5 day prevent skin infection , take account systemic medication organ function . The patient return treatment site daylight exposure register immediate adverse event ( pain ) contact phone 1 week treatment procedure evaluate adverse effect day treatment . Blinded evaluation perform 4 12 month treatment procedure , include registration grade actinic keratoses treatment area ( treatment efficacy ) registration adverse event ( scar pigmentary change ) . Evaluation support pre-treatment photograph plastic drawing . Efficacy evaluation Patients evaluate 4 12 month investigator blind side allocate assisted ablative fractional laser treatment . Statistics Wilcoxon match pair sign rank test use compare pair data . This study investigator initiate independently finance Oslo University Hospital- Rikshospitalet</detailed_description>
