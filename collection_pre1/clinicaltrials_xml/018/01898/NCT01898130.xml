	<brief_summary>This study evaluate drug call bevacizumab patient cancer whose disease spread brain . This study evaluate effect bevacizumab systemic solid tumor cancer . Bevacizumab medication think bevacizumab may interfere growth new blood vessel ; therefore might stop tumor growth possibly shrink tumor keep receive nutrient oxygen supply blood vessel .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine radiographic response rate patient solid tumor brain metastasis treat bevacizumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate progression-free survival ( PFS ) rate 6 month . II . Determine time progression base magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) compute tomography ( CT ) scan . III . Determine time response base radiographic imaging . IV . Determine duration response base radiographic imaging . V. Determine overall survival . VI . Collect additional safety data . VII . Assess change quality life use Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Brain ( FACT-Br ) treatment . OUTLINE : Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute every 2 week . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 8 week .</detailed_description>
