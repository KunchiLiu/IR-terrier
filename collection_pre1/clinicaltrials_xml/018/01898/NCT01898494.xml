	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well transoral surgery follow low-dose standard-dose radiation therapy work treat patient human papilloma virus ( HPV ) positive stage III-IVA oropharyngeal cancer . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Drugs use chemotherapy work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving radiation therapy chemotherapy may kill tumor cell remain surgery . It yet know much extra treatment need give surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transoral Surgery Followed By Low-Dose Standard-Dose Radiation Therapy With Without Chemotherapy Treating Patients With HPV Positive Stage III-IVA Oropharyngeal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Accrual , risk distribution , surgical quality use determine feasibility prospective multi-institutional study transoral surgery HPV positive ( + ) oropharynx cancer follow risk-adjusted adjuvant therapy . II . To assess oncologic efficacy follow transoral resection adjuvant therapy patient determine `` intermediate risk '' surgical excision , 2-year progression free survival ( PFS ) rate examine . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate patient distribution various histologic risk feature . II . To assess compare early late toxicity associate transoral surgery ( TOS ) different dos adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy ( PORT ) . III . To evaluate swallow function TOS risk-adjusted adjuvant therapy . IV . To evaluate quality life ( QOL ) , swallow perception performance , voice outcome , head neck symptom . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To correlate tumor TP53 mutation associate mutation profile pathologic finding , PFS outcome parameter patient resectable HPV-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma ( OPSCC ) treatment . II . To evaluate radiation resistance marker , include excision repair cross complement 1 ( ERCC1 ) single nucleotide polymorphism protein expression , correlate treatment efficacy . III . To investigate usefulness biomarkers predict progression-free survival biomarkers , include tumor ERCC1 , epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) , plasma cytokine/chemokines , cellular immunity HPV , oral HPV deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) . OUTLINE : Patients classify risk status ( low risk , intermediate risk , high risk ) assign appropriate treatment group . Patients classified intermediate risk randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A ( low risk ) : Patients undergo transoral surgical resection oropharyngeal tumor . ARM B ( intermediate risk ) : Patients undergo transoral surgical resection oropharyngeal tumor . Patients undergo low-dose intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) daily ( QD ) five day week 5 week . ARM C ( intermediate risk ) : Patients undergo transoral surgical resection oropharyngeal tumor . Patients undergo standard-dose IMRT QD five day week 6 week . ARM D ( high risk ) : Patients undergo transoral surgical resection oropharyngeal tumor . Patients undergo standard-dose IMRT QD five day week 6-7 week . Patients also receive cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute carboplatin IV 30 minute day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 , 43 radiation therapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
