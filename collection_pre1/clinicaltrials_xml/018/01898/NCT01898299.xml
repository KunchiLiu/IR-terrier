	<brief_summary>The purpose present research test potential new treatment auditory verbal hallucination schizophrenia use transcranial Direct Current Stimulation ( tDCS ) , neurostimulation technique pass extremely weak electric current brain . During treatment , two electrode position scalp region brain implicate abnormal cortical activity associate auditory verbal hallucination schizophrenia . Due directional flow current , one electrode , term `` cathodal '' , inhibit cortical activity , , term `` anodal '' , increase cortical activity . These electrode place cathodal stimulation apply area associate hyperactivity anodal stimulation area associate hypoactivity . One preliminary study reveal form neurostimulation alleviate auditory verbal hallucination symptom immediately follow five day treatment three month final treatment . The goal study replicate effect explore mechanism may underpin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>45 patient persistent auditory verbal hallucination recruit study . Each individual participate behavioral assessment last 3 hour randomize receive series active vs. sham tDCS treatment . For active treatment , patient inhibitory ( cathodal ) tDCS electrode place left auditory cortex relative anodal place frontal cortex right side . tDCS treatment take place 20 min per day 5 consecutive day . For sham , procedures similar except sham ( inactive ) tDCS treatment use . Assessment battery repeat follow completion treatment 1 3 mo follow treatment . In addition , patient offer possibility participate concurrent magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) study aim evaluate effect tDCS activation auditory cortex auditory discrimination task well image parameter related rest brain activity metabolism . Patients agree participate MRI study scan active sham tDCS . In addition hallucinating patient , recruit 20 healthy control 20 non-hallucinating patient , similar assessment patient , receive tDCS . Overall , investigator hypothesize tDCS treatment lead reduction hallucination , improvement auditory function , change EEG MRI measurement patient closely resemble healthy volunteer non-hallucinating patient .</detailed_description>
