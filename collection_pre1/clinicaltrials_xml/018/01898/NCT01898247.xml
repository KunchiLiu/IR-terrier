	<brief_summary>The goal propose research investigate use medical simulation mastery learning ( learner must reach high standard completion training ) curriculum improve internal medicine resident ' skill perform thoracentesis procedure ( remove fluid around lung ) patient . Additionally , evaluate skill affect patient outcome compare thoracenteses perform simulator-trained resident `` traditional '' training . This project evaluate overall hypothesis : simulation-based training use mastery learn approach improve medicine resident 's thoracentesis skills improve patient outcome satisfaction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Simulation-Based Mastery Learning Thoracentesis Improve Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Given medical procedure second common cause complication afflict 3 % hospitalized patient , simulation-based mastery learn applied procedure do medical center . In academic hospital , bedside procedure thoracentesis procedure often perform unsupervised medical trainee . Traditionally , medical trainee learn procedure rely historic `` see one , one , teach one '' mentality . Unfortunately , approach subject patient procedure trainee competent . Through use medical simulation , medical educator increase essential knowledge skill trainees assure procedural competence reduce patient exposure undue risk . Medical simulation training use mastery learn model improve clinical skill reduce risk procedure-associated injury . Our research group pioneer use evidence-based approach teach medical trainee . Mastery learn require trainee demonstrate uniformly high level skill train completion . This ensure competence medical simulator actual patient encounter .</detailed_description>
