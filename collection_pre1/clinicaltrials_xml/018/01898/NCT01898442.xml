	<brief_title>High Ticagrelor Loading Dose STEMI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dual antiplatelet therapy consist aspirin P2Y12 receptor antagonist cornerstone treatment prevention thrombotic event patient acute coronary syndrome ( ACS ) . Ticagrelor reversible direct act P2Y12 antagonist , show superior clopidogrel , adjunct aspirin , prevent recurrent ischemic event , include cardiovascular mortality . Ticagrelor recently approve clinical use ACS patient , dose 180 mg load dose 90 mg twice/day maintenance dose . Ticagrelor consider first line therapy administer soon possible ACS patient , include present ST-elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI ) undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . However , discordant data onset antiplatelet effect particular set . In particular , pharmacodynamic effect ticagrelor recommend 180mg load dose delayed patient STEMI undergo primary PCI . The use high load dose regimen ticagrelor therefore advocate . However , administration high ticagrelor load dose may overcome limitation still unknown represent aim study . The propose investigation prospective , randomize , parallel design STEMI patient undergo primary PCI randomize receive three different load dose ticagrelor ( 180 mg , 270 mg 360 mg ) . Pharmacodynamic test perform several time point test study hypothesis high load dose regiment achieve promptly enhance platelet inhibitory effect . This study provide insight pharmacodynamic effect higher ticagrelor load dos help clinician choose appropriate treatment avoid complication related inadequate platelet inhibition early phase patient STEMI undergo primary PCI .</detailed_description>
