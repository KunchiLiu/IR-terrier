	<brief_summary>Smoking rate among individual live HIV/AIDS range 47 % 65 % , prevalence roughly three time rate general population . This elevated prevalence alarm give increase likelihood numerous adverse health outcome experience HIV-positive smoker . Cigarette smoking associate great level HIV-related symptom burden appear decrease effectiveness HAART assess viral load CD4 count ( Vidrine 2009 , Marshall 2009 , Vidrine 2007 , Miguez-Burbane 2005 ) . PLWHA smoke also increase risk infection noninfectious pulmonary complication AIDS-associated non-AIDS-associated malignancy compare nonsmoker . This study refine pilot test theory-driven smoking cessation intervention enhance exist behavioral approach test impact text message reminder take varenicline feasibility additional impact include adherence-focused behavioral cessation counseling . The investigator propose randomize 190 participant , recruit three HIV/AIDS clinic , three arm pilot study compare : 1 ) Standard Care ( SC ) , 2 ) SC + text message reminder , 3 ) SC + text message reminder + cell phone-delivered adherence-focused behavioral therapy ( ABT ) . Participants three arm receive varenicline 12 week .

	<detailed_description>To accomplish study 's aim investigator propose three phase study : PHASE 1 ) Formative phase ( n=40 ) pretest text message explore barrier cessation adherence cessation medication ; PHASE 2 ) Pretest phase ( n=10 ) test revise intervention component assess design issue may emerge , include associate contacting subject via cell phone , participant capacity view text message , time content text messaging , use eCAPs system ; PHASE 3 ) Pilot randomize control trial ( RCT ) investigator randomize 190 participant , recruit St. Luke 's Roosevelt Comprehensive Care Clinics , three-arm study compare : 1 ) Standard care ( SC ) , include receive varenicline brief counseling ; 2 ) SC + daily text message medication reminder ( TxT ) ; 3 ) SC + TxT + seven session cell-phone-delivered , adherence-focused behavioral therapy ( ABT ) . Text message include medication reminder motivational message relate adherence maintain abstinence . Participants three arm receive varenicline 12 week . To total sample 150 subject end treatment 12 week , 50 subject arm , investigator randomize 190 patient account 20 % attrition rate . Subjects survey six time point include baseline assessment . PHASE 1 : FORMATIVE EVALUATION Focus group patient . Focus group ( last 60 90 minute ) conduct HIV+ smoker . To recruit patient Phase 1 , research assistant approach individual within clinic set screen tobacco use . If current smoker ask wish participate schedule focus group convenient time . The research assistants recruit 80 patient expect complete 4 focus group 10 participant total 40 participant . The main aim focus group : 1 ) obtain feedback text message library determine message acceptable useful , often patient would like receive message ; 2 ) ass comfort use pre-paid phone receive send message ; 3 ) ass confidentiality concern regard receive text message patient may edit avoid loss confidentiality ; 4 ) explore attitude beliefs varenicline , previous experience use varenicline , potential challenge adhere varenicline , similarly explore experience past quit attempt barrier ( individual , social , structural ) quit . The focus group follow write guide . In addition pre-specified domain draw research question , group facilitator also listen explore emergent topic . Focus group audio-recorded two research assistant take note group discussion . All audio recording transcribe verbatim , transcript supplement note take focus group ensure accuracy . These transcript analyze pre-determined emergent theme . PHASE 2 : PRE TEST Prior start RCT investigator pre-test intervention component ( ARM 3 ) ass study design issue may emerge , include associate contacting subject via cell phone , participant capacity view text message , time content text messaging , use eCAPs system . Ten patient enrolled phase target sample 6 end-of-treatment . Quantitative data collection , describe , follow . The investigator also conduct post-intervention in-depth interview enrol subject obtain feedback component ' utility , acceptability , safety . The research team consultant meet pilot test make adjustment intervention component prior RCT . PHASE 3 : PILOT RCT Overview . This phase research compare three smoke cessation intervention test refined Phases 1 2 . A total 190 PLWHA patient CCC screen phase target sample 150 end-of-treatment . The investigator use randomize controlled trial design . This formal efficacy trial test intervention feasibility , safety , acceptability . Additionally study provide preliminary evidence efficacy intervention component respect study 's main endpoint : ) adherence varenicline b ) smoking abstinence 12 24 week . This data inform design large R01 . Intervention condition ARM 1 : Standard Care ( SC ) . All CCC patient screen tobacco use routine visit offer referral New York State ( NYS ) Quitline . As part current standard care , trial participant receive self-help information sheet , tailor HIV+ smoker frequently ask question use varenicline , wallet card State Quitline number . All subject offer varenicline 12 week . All study participant ask whether prefer receive phone call text message study staff via phone phone provide study , cost participant . If choose latter option , give pre-paid cell phone 3 month . Subjects SC arm receive phone facilitate ability call Quitline assistance enable u send follow-up appointment reminder via text message . Each pre-paid phone allowance 200 minute unlimited text message per month . The investigator instruct participant use minute toward tobacco treatment study related purpose . The investigator track minute use minute use , investigator add enough minute need contact subject . Varenicline therapy : All patient enrol study give 12-week supply varenicline . The dose 0.5 mg/day 3 day follow 0.5 mg BID next 4 day , 1 mg BID first 7 day . The research assistant explain use medication , review potential side effect , provide subject wallet size instruction card dose schedule information use medication . Subjects receive medication follow-up study visit one week consent . Subjects receive three-week supply varenicline return week 4 study ( time first week receive medication ) . At week 4 visit receive another 4 week medication ask return week 8 receive final 4 week medication . More one eCAP bottle distribute , depend dose medication week treatment . ARM 2 : SC + Text message ( TxT ) . Subjects randomize arm receive SC plus twice daily text messaging remind take medication . Participants begin receive text message day start take medication , text messaging continue 12 week . The text message design convey relevant information subject permit protective ambiguity . For example , none message transmit participant use term HIV AIDS . In addition , text message tag `` ACT '' ( Adherence Cessation Treatment ) indicate come study . Participants receive one medication adherence reminder message one motivational message regard tobacco cessation day . RTI staff monitor delivery text message . If participant receive text message two consecutive day , study research assistant call ass reason message failure . During study , participant may opt receive category message contact study research assistant inform him/her request . Requests decline specific message type fully withdraw study handle promptly subject stop receiving message within 48 hour submit request study research assistant . The investigator use symbol text accommodate low literacy level . ARM 3 : SC + TxT + adherence-focused motivational behavioral therapy ( ABT ) . In addition SC TxT , behavioral intervention group receive seven proactive cell-phone-delivered counseling session 6-week period . Drs . Shelley Krebs adapt telephone counsel manual develop test Dr. Sherman base Dr. David Kalman 's `` Treatment Manual Extended Counseling Treat Tobacco Addiction , '' . The draft manual review Drs . Sherman , Wolfe , Morgenstern revise prior Phase 2 pretest . The research team meet revise manual base finding Phase 2 post-intervention qualitative interview . The content manual combine principle Cognitive Behavioral Therapy ( CBT ) Motivational Interviewing ( MI ) technique , apply smoke cessation promising result .</detailed_description>
