	<detailed_description>A continuous peripheral nerve block—also term `` perineural local anesthetic infusion '' —involves percutaneous insertion catheter adjacent peripheral nerve , follow local anesthetic administration via catheter , provide anesthesia/analgesia . Continuous peripheral nerve block may provide hospital setting , use lightweight , portable pump permit ambulatory infusion well . This technique 's most-common application provide analgesia follow surgical procedure , enjoy explosive growth past decade due multiple factor , include simplicity ultrasound-guided catheter insertion , ability provide analgesia concurrent administration various anticoagulant ( unlike epidural infusion ) , relative lack complication associate technique . Importantly , ambulatory infusion experience logarithmic increase growth due fact oral analgesic often provide insufficient analgesia follow painful outpatient surgical procedure . The optimal local anesthetic ( predominantly ropivacaine United States ) concentration remain unknown , overwhelming percentage investigator use 0.2 % ( &gt; 98 % report ) . It concentration basal infusion rate 4-8 mL/h report . However , recent evidence suggest continuous femoral nerve block , local anesthetic dose determines infusion effect , concentration . This raise tantalize possibility basal infusion half standard rate ropivacaine twice standard concentration result equivalent analgesia , since total dose remain unchanged ( rate [ volume ] x concentration determines total dose ) . The study suggest dose , rate/concentration , determine perineural effect involve femoral catheter . However , femoral infusion rarely provide outpatient due induce thigh muscle weakness result high risk fall . In contrast , perineural catheter location popliteal-sciatic often provide outpatient less fall risk ( patient often avoid `` walk '' operative foot use crutch ) . If relationship hold true catheter location , would mean adequate postoperative analgesia could provide fraction basal infusion rate—and , therefore , fraction local anesthetic volume . In addition , one concentration/dose combination result less muscle weakness , least equivalent analgesia , risk fall might decrease well patient DO ambulate postoperatively operative foot . The result : portable infusion pump ' local anesthetic reservoir volume consume low rate , greatly increase duration post-operative analgesia provide ambulatory perineural infusion ; , risk postoperative fall might decrease . In fact , currently evidence low-rate , high-concentration continuous ropivacaine popliteal-sciatic block decrease incidence unwanted insensate extremity compare high-rate , low-concentration infusion . However , study outpatient power determine analgesia equivalence , criticize rely subjective endpoint . More importantly , subject self-administered bolus dos , make impossible determine total dose actually receive confounding result . The investigator therefore propose volunteer-based clinical trial test hypothesis provide ropivacaine different concentration rate ( 0.1 % 8 mL/hour vs. 0.4 % 2 mL/hour ) —but equivalent total basal dose ( 8 mg/hour ) —produces comparable effect infuse continuous popliteal-sciatic nerve block . The primary endpoint tolerance cutaneous electrical current apply plantar aspect foot . This objective endpoint validate multiple previous publication correlate intra- post-operative pain . Ethics Inclusion Volunteers : Currently , data investigate hypothesis popliteal-sciatic nerve block . The study do without volunteer model describe follow reason . Of note , study investigate principle whether local anesthetic concentration/rate/dose within continuous popliteal-sciatic nerve block affect sensory motor effect . To test hypothesis require include patient post-surgical acute pain . We need determine whether not—and extent—these local anesthetic factor affect sensory motor block . An acute pain model necessary case . We try ascertain concentrations/rates/doses local anesthetic optimize postoperative analgesia—which would require acute pain model . Rather , try determine factor affect result sensory and/or motor blockade . This theoretical question immense importance answer involve healthy volunteer ; , answer use acute pain model ( explanation ) . In post-surgical patient , surgical pain must treated—it unconscionable ( unethical ) NOT treat pain . Previous clinical study ( unpublished failures—the P.I . know discuss colleague ) attempt answer question propose volunteer study answer fail reason : surgical patient pain , analgesic MUST provide . This confound collect data . For example , perineural infusion provide basal dose 4 mL/h , patient surgical breakthrough pain , bolus local anesthetic must administer provide analgesia . Given try determine relative effect concentration dose upon block effect , extra bolus dos top basal infusion confound result : patient low pain score , intervention s/he treat discomfort additional bolus dose local anesthetic therefore high total dose local anesthetic combine basal infusion ? In propose volunteer model surgical pain , therefore treatment group receive basal infusion require bolus dos . Only way able discern relative effect concentration dose . This critical question answer give provide continuous popliteal-sciatic nerve block result degree muscle weakness ( well femoral nerve sensory deficit provide post-surgical analgesia ) ; muscle weakness increase risk fall ; 5 fall may result catastrophic post-operative complication . The problem many foot/ankle procedures—such bunionectomy—are painful require potent postoperative analgesia—and continuous femoral nerve block provide potent analgesia ( top oral intravenous analgesic COX-2 inhibitor opioids ) . Insurance company pay in-hospital stay nearly foot/ankle procedure , therefore patient choice return home either insufficient analgesia oral analgesic ; , receive perineural popliteal-sciatic nerve block use portable infusion pump . Unfortunately , relatively high rate currently use deliver local anesthetic , infusion pump reservoirs outlast moderate-to-severe surgical pain . So , must find way extend analgesia continuous popliteal-sciatic nerve block minimize result motor block . Answering vital question help healthcare provider administer continuous popliteal-sciatic nerve block ( well catheter anatomic location ) safer manner , yet still optimize postoperative analgesia . Only volunteer study critical question answer ; answer critically important maximize care literally hundreds-of-thousands patient receive annually United States , million across World ( continuous peripheral nerve block use Europe Australia even United States early adoption technique 1990s ) .
