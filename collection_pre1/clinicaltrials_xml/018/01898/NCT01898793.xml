	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose activated natural killer cell treat patient relapsed refractory acute myeloid leukemia myeloid dysplastic syndrome . Giving chemotherapy donor natural killer cell infusion help stop growth cancer cell . It may also stop patient 's immune system reject donor 's natural killer cell . Modified natural killer cell may help body build immune response kill cancer cell . Aldesleukin ( interleukin-2 ) may stimulate white blood cell ( include natural killer cell ) kill leukemia cell .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Refractory AML without complete remission ( CR ) induction therapy ( primary induction failure ) relapse AML obtain CR . OR Highrisk AML ( ELN criterion ; See Appendix C ) complete remission ( CR ) either refuse hematopoietic stem cell transplantation OR currently eligible hematopoietic stem cell transplantation OR hematopoietic stem cell transplantation reserve later relapse . This inclusive patient minimal residual disease evidence cytogenetics , molecular testing , and/or flow cytometry . OR Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) excess blast ( &gt; 5 % ) progressive disease ( see section 12.4 ) time initiation DNA hypomethylator treatment past 2 year , OR failure achieve complete partial response hematological improvement ( see section 12.4 ) least six cycle azacytidine four cycle decitabine administer past 2 year , OR intolerance azacytidine decitabine . MDS patient isolate 5q abnormality meet criterion lenalidomide therapy DNA hypomethylator therapy also eligible . At least 18 year age . Available HLAhaploidentical donor meet follow criterion : Related donor ( sibling , offspring , offspring sibling ) At least 18 year age HLAhaploidentical donor/recipient match least Class I serologic type A &amp; B locus . In general good health , medically able tolerate leukapheresis require harvest NK cell study . Negative hepatitis , HTLV , HIV donor viral screen Not pregnant Voluntary write consent participate study Patients know CNS involvement AML eligible provide treated CSF clear least 2 week prior enrollment study . CNS therapy ( chemotherapy radiation ) continue medically indicate study treatment . Karnofsky performance status ≥ 50 % Adequate organ function define : Total bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dl AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3.0 x IULN Creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min/1.73 m2 CockcroftGault Formula Oxygen saturation ≥90 % room air Ejection fraction ≥35 % Able corticosteroid immune suppressive medication begin Day 3 continue 30 day infusion CIML NK cell . However , use lowlevel corticosteroid permit deem medically necessary . Lowlevel corticosteroid use define 10mg less prednisone per day . .
