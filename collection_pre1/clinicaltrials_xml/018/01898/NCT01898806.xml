	<brief_summary>Alopecia areata common form hair loss reportedly occur 1.7 % population time life . Alopecia areata apparently trigger individual 's immune system attack hair follicle scalp body result hair loss range single patch scalp ( patch type alopecia areata ) loss every hair scalp body ( alopecia universalis ) . Currently , limit treatment option alopecia areata unfortunately , treatment utilize never rigorously test placebo control trial . Triamcinolone ( Kenalog ) steroid solution use treatment alopecia areata 50 year . It administer via injection scalp appear efficacy patient mild moderate alopecia areata . The investigator currently objective data frequency occurrence successful regrowth , duration response incidence side effect . In addition , disagreement clinician regard dose intralesional triamcinolone ( IL TAC ) consider effective . This study aim determine frequency response treatment 3 concentration IL TAC , 2.5mg/ml , 5mg/ml 10mg/ml well duration response incidence side effect compare treatment placebo ( sterile saline solution ) . After 1st 6 month non partial responder may treat 6 month open label triamcinolone dose deem appropriate investigator . The investigator also perform skin biopsy scalp draw blood select time point order examine immunohistochemical/pathological response scalp hair follicle systemic circulation treatment IL TAC alopecia areata .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Alopecia areata ( AA ) major medical problem prevalent autoimmune disease US . AA represent second common form hair loss , cause significant disfigurement psychological distress affect individual . AA affect individual autoimmune disease combine , include lupus erythematosus , type 1 diabetes , psoriasis , multiple sclerosis rheumatoid arthritis . In contrast condition , research pathogenesis development innovative therapy AA lag behind . Intralesional steroid ( IL TAC ) arguably commonly used treatment AA , especially patient less 50 % hair loss . Despite , adequately power , randomize control clinical trial ( RCTs ) examine efficacy , safety duration effect IL TAC . In addition , dosage strength use varies among practitioner efficacy safety alternate dos IL TAC never examine well design RCT . Quantitative biomarkers AA crucial step toward translational research aim clinical trial AA . The investigator evaluate efficacy treat patient moderate AA 6mths IL TAC strength 2.5mg/ml , 5mg/ml , IL TAC 10mg/ml versus intralesional saline ( placebo ) follow 6mth follow-up period evaluate relapse identify clinical correlation treatment outcome modulation key AA-associated immunohistopathological marker biomarkers treat skin ; include NKG2DL expression hair follicle , immune infiltration ( CD8+NKG2D+ cell ) expression interferon response gene . After 1st 6 month non partial responder may treat open label triamcinolone dose deem appropriate investigator .</detailed_description>
