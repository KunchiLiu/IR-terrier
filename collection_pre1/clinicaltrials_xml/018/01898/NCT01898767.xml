	<detailed_description>Theinvestigators others show airway epithelial cell infection human rhinovirus ( HRV ) major risk factor subsequent exacerbation . Additionally , investigator show nucleotide receptor , P2X7 , important host factor prevention exacerbation , data suggest may occur level alveolar macrophage . Alveolar macrophage facilitate resolution inflammation part generate eicosanoid metabolite arachidonic acid include prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) lipoxin A4 ( LXA4 ) . Patients severe asthma reduce capacity generate PGE2 LXA4 compare non-severe asthma , despite alveolar macrophage expression two key enzyme involve production . These data suggest pro-resolving eicosanoid metabolism efficient airway epithelial cell communication alveolar macrophage , pathway may defective patient severe asthma . Moreover , inoculation experiment human rhinovirus ( HRV ) demonstrate alveolar macrophage express cox-2 resolution . These data lead central hypothesis transcellular generation PGE2 lipoxins regulate P2X7-induced cox-2 expression alveolar macrophage , process facilitates resolution HRV-triggered exacerbation .</detailed_description>
