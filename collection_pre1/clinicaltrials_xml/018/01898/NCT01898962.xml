	<brief_summary>Patients metastatic cancer usually treat systemic therapy ( treat entire body ) assumption localize treatment clinically apparent metastasis would impact survival . In set increasingly effective systemic therapy limit metastatic disease , aggressive treatment clinically active site disease ( alone addition systemic therapy ) may improve survival .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Up recently assume set metastatic solid tumor , locoregional control clinically apparent metastasis substantially impact survival due undetectable micrometastic ( clinically visualize ) disease ultimately lead treatment failure/progression . However , advanced systemic therapy continue improve control micrometastatic disease , failures original site disease remain common . Furthermore , study show locoregional treatment limit clinical metastasis actually improve survival . Therefore , investigator hypothesize aggressive treatment clinically active site disease ( alone addition systemic therapy ) may improve survival alter course disease patient limited metastatic disease .</detailed_description>
