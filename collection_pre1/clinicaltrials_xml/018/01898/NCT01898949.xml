	<brief_summary>Human fat tissue essentially white fat , main function store excess energy intake , release necessary . Brown fat far less abundant present body burn fat ( thus energy ) generate heat maintain body temperature around 96 degree . This phenomenon call thermogenesis . When human expose cold chronic basis , brown fat expands becomes active , consequently burn energy . The amount brown fat high winter , daily short ( 20 minute ) exposure cold might sufficient induce activity . We hypothesize daily short term ( 20 minute ) exposure cold environment ( 4 °C ) four week increase adaptive BAT-mediated thermogenesis . CIT DIT increase proportionally ( increase CIT DIT correlate ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study 3 phase : Phase 1 : baseline test . This phase take place begin study establish several physical , physiological metabolic study include measure height , weight , body composition , sedentary rest metabolic rate metabolic chamber well metabolic cardiac response cold . Phase 2 : cold exposure ( treatment ) phase . This phase initiate immediately phase 1 last 4 week . Each work day ( Monday Friday ) subject spend 20 minute cold room wear light clothes . Phase 3 : post-treatment testing . The physiological metabolic study measure baseline repeat 3 day .</detailed_description>
