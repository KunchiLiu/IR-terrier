	<brief_title>Oligonucleotide Ligation Assay ( OLA ) Resistance Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Durable suppression HIV replication critical ( 1 ) improve health infected individual , ( 2 ) reduce HIV transmission sexual partner mother infant , ( 3 ) maintain effectiveness current 1st-line non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) - base ART . Across multiple trial , individual NNRTI-resistance , even low-concentrations , substantially great virologic failure treat NVP- vs PI-ART . A cost-effective strategy need detect manage ARV-resistant HIV infection . A simple low-cost innovative assay investigator develop successfully transfer Asian African country ( oligonucleotide ligation assay ( OLA ) ) detect NNRTI+lamivudine ( 3TC ) resistant HIV use reagent cost &lt; $ 7.00/person . Furthermore , detection NNRTI-resistance OLA highly ( P &lt; 0.001 ) associate virologic failure nevirapine ( NVP ) -ART two retrospective study ; one Thai woman previously randomize single-dose NVP second ARV-na√Øve Kenyan adult . The investigator hypothesize implementation OLA routine care allow Kenyan clinician appropriately target protease inhibitor ( PI ) -based ART improve rate durable suppression viral replication , thus improve CD4 cell gain individual ' health , reduce transmission ARV-resistant HIV within community , maintain utility NNRTI-ART . In addition , investigator hypothesize programmatically OLA-guided ART cost-efficient compare current strategy empiric use NNRTI-ART initial treatment .</detailed_description>
