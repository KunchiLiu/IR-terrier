	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : For Group 1 Group 2 : Male female patient confirm acid αglucosidase ( GAA ) enzyme deficiency tissue source and/or confirm GAA gene mutation without know cardiac hypertrophy . Patient willing able provide sign informed consent Patient able ambulate 50 meter ( approximately 160 foot ) without stop without assistive device . Use assistive device community ambulation appropriate . Patient force vital capacity ( FVC ) upright position ≥50 % predict . The patient , female childbearing potential , must negative pregnancy test [ urine betahuman chorionic gonadotropin ( βhCG ) ] baseline . Group 2 patient : The patient previously treat alglucosidase alfa least 9 month . Exclusion criterion : For Group 1 Group 2 : Patient wheelchair dependent . Patient require invasiveventilation ( noninvasive ventilation allow ) . Patient participate another clinical study use investigational treatment . Patient , opinion Investigator , unable adhere requirement study . Patient clinically significant organic disease ( exception symptom relate Pompe disease ) , include clinically significant cardiovascular , hepatic , pulmonary , neurologic , renal disease , medical condition , serious intercurrent illness , extenuate circumstance , opinion Investigator , preclude participation study potentially decrease survival . Patient submit MRI examination formal contraindication pacemaker , implant ferromagnetic metal , anxiety disorder , etc . Group 1 : Patient previous treatment alglucosidase alfa enzyme replacement therapy ( ERT ) Pompe disease . Group 2 : Patient high risk severe allergic reaction neoGAA ( i.e . previous moderate severe anaphylactic reaction alglucosidase alfa and/or patient immunoglobulin ( Ig ) E antibodies alglucosidase alfa , and/or history sustain high immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) antibody titer alglucosidase alfa opinion investigator suggest high risk allergic reaction neoGAA ) . The information intend contain consideration relevant patient 's potential participation clinical trial .</criteria>
