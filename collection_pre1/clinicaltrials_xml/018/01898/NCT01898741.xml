	<brief_summary>Pancreatic cancer poor survival , due late diagnosis lack sufficient treatment option locally advanced tumor metastasize patient . High dose radiotherapy small margin seem feasible current technical possibility , e.g . fiducial guide stereotactic radiotherapy . In study , want evaluate safety technical feasibility cone beam CT guide stereotactic radiotherapy locally advance pancreatic carcinoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cone-beam CT Guided Stereotactic Radiation Therapy Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective study : To determine safety technical feasibility stereotactic radiotherapy locally advance pancreatic carcinoma Study design : Pilot study determine safety feasibility Study population : Patients locally advance pancreatic carcinoma , without distant metastasis Intervention : Patients undergo endoscopic fiducial marker placement , patient get custom-made individual corset . Radiotherapy deliver three fraction 8 Gy outpatient basis . Primary study outcome : The main study endpoint safety procedure , express proportion patient experience treatment-induced toxicity grade 3 accord CTC-AE 4.0 due complete procedure within 90 day last radiation . Secondary study outcome : Other study parameter technical feasibility , treatment response , quality life , overall survival , progression free survival , rate possible secondary resection Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Increased severe toxicity may occur due intervention , treatment related toxicity limit due strict dose constraint organ risk ( e.g . duodenum , stomach ) . Potential benefit may pain relief , due local control tumor , prolong survival .</detailed_description>
