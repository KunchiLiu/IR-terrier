	<brief_summary>It hypothesize , base recent trial , early intervention reduce cardiovascular morbidity mortality individual type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) . This finding may imply atherosclerosis diabetes diagnose , either negligible , early , non-advanced , still modifiable disease stage . However , sparse information available regard atherosclerosis prevalence characteristic diabetes presentation . Furthermore , although cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) prevention major goal treatment T2DM , risk assessment tool , mostly base traditional CV risk factor , lack adequate specificity identify individual high risk . Therefore , non-invasive test , carotid ultrasound , recommend good define CV risk several group individual , include intermediate risk T2DM . This clinical study aim improve investigator knowledge cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) subject newly diagnose T2DM ( NEWDM ) . The investigator hypothesis carotid ultrasound ( carotid intima medium thickness [ CIMT ] carotid plaque [ CP ] ) show bad subclinical/preclinical CVD stage NEWDM compare non-diabetic ( CONTROL ) individual . Moreover , carotid ultrasound also identify T2DM individual high risk intervention intensive . Because individual T2DM high prevalence several CV risk factor , NEWDM match CONTROL individual , age sex ( main determinant atherosclerosis ) , also know , treat hypertension dyslipidemia , smoke habit . The investigator study NEWDM CONTROL individual without clinical CVD . This cross-sectional longitudinal ( 18 month follow-up ) case-control study . The main study variable carotid ultrasound derive variable . The main aim study : 1 ) investigate CIMT CP prevalence difference NEWDM CONTROL subject ; 2 ) characterize subset NEWDM subject high CIMT ( ≥ mean+1SD ≥ P75th ) CP presence ; 3 ) early characterize individual subclinical CVD worsens ( CIMT progression ≥ mean + 1SD ≥ P75th ) even standard ( accord clinical guideline ) diabetes treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : In Mediterranean population , investigator hypothesize CIMT presence carotid plaque ( CP ) : 1 . Are high patient newly diagnose T2DM control population adjust cardiovascular risk factor , 2 . Can identify subject T2DM increase cardiovascular risk begin disease , , 3 . Can identify subject subclinical cardiovascular disease progress despite treatment T2DM accord clinical practice . Aims : Primary objective : 1 . To investigate difference CIMT presence CP subject NEWDM control population . Cross-sectional study . 2 . To identify characterize subset NEWDM subject present increase CIMT ( great mean + 1SD ≥ P75th ) carotid plaque presence . Cross-sectional study 3 . To early characterize individual subclinical CVD worsens ( CIMT progression ≥ mean + 1SD ≥ P75th ) even multifactorial treatment diabetes accord guideline . Longitudinal study design repeat measure . Secondary objective : 1 . To study main determinant CIMT CP presence NEWDM subject control population . In addition cardiovascular risk factor study : 1. association Mediterranean diet biomarkers ( serum urine ) diet adherence ( semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire ) 2. genetic determinant CVD 2 . To investigate main determinant progression CIMT subject treat accord clinical practice guideline 3 . To investigate association baseline CIMT , progression , presence CP clinical score use estimate cardiovascular risk . These score : REGICOR ( Registre Gironí del Cor : Gerona Heart Register ) , calibrate Framingham Score Mediterranean population , low risk SCORE ( Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation ) , UKPDS ( United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study ) score ( specific T2DM ) . 4 . To identify carotid plaque biomarkers metabolomic approach</detailed_description>
