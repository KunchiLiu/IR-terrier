	<brief_summary>This randomize , open-label , sequential , single dose , 4-period crossover study . This study conduct measure relative bioavailability original gelatin capsule ( GC ) formulation two new formulation ( hydroxypropyl-methylcellulose [ HPMC ] capsule enteric coat tablet [ ECT ] ) afuresertib ( AFU ) , feed fasted state . The study compose Screening , Treatment , Follow-up Periods . Screening assessment determine subject eligibility perform within 3 week prior first dose study drug Treatment Period . Eligible subject randomize receive 4 6 possible study treatment ( A : AFU GC administer fasted state , B : AFU GC administer fed state , C : AFU HPMC capsule administer fasted state , D : AFU HPMC capsule administer fed state , E : AFU ECT administer fasted state , F : AFU ECT administer fed state ) 4 treatment period ( one per treatment period ) . Subjects receive single dose one six study treatment ( A , B , C , D , E , F ) Day 1 Dosing Period , accord one 6 treatment sequence ( CEDA , EFAB , ABFC , BDCE , FCBD , DAEF ) . There minimum 10 Day washout period dos administer Treatment Period . A Follow-up visit conduct within 10-14 day last dose . A subject 's total time involve study approximately 9 week . At least 36 subject enrol study , ensure least 6 subject randomize receive treatment sequence .</brief_summary>
