	<brief_title>Studying Erythropoietin Receptor Presence Function Human Cancer Specimens</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Erythropoietin , EPO , main regulator stimulator bone marrow erythropoiesis , responsible growth differentiation erythroid cell lineage . The clone gene , lead production recombinant product , rHuEPO . rHuEPO successfully serve last couple decade research clinical application . The product show improve anemia end-stage renal disease , cancer-related anemia , well type anemia and/or blood loss . Improved anemia rHuEPO characterize increase hemoglobin ( Hb ) hematocrit ( Hct ) level , reduce blood transfusion requirement improve quality life . Thus , use rHuEPO become routine daily practice hematology oncology , million cancer patient without anemia treat rHuEPO . Indeed , rHuEPO become blockbuster ( annual billion dollar sale ) common biological product market . In 2003 , report suggest breast cancer , Head Neck cancer patient , treat rHuEPO short survival patient treat hormone . These report follow several others . However , report , include , lead different conclusion . Meta-analysis also fail provide definitive answer . Three potential mechanism , none proven far , propose explain potential poor prognosis among rHuEPO-treated cancer patient : 1 . Stimulation EPO receptor ( EPO-R ) , exist surface tumor cell . 2 . High level Hb Hct , lead viscosity thrombotic-like complication . 3 . Increased angiogenesis induce rHuEPO promote tumor progression . As expect , conflict report elicit controversy among clinical hematologic-oncologic community , reduce use product lead FDA Oncology Drug Advisory Committee ( ODAC ) publish alert . The American Society Clinical Oncology ( ASCO ) American Society Hematology ( ASH ) , well European Organization Research Treatment Cancer ( EORTC ) , publish strict guideline , define patient circumstance rHuEPO administer . With long-time collaborator , Prof. D. Neumann , Sackler Faculty Medicine , TAU , establish European international consortium , top basic scientist clinical investigator , general aim study topic . Recently , consortium , lead Prof. Neumann notify EU recognise importance project decide fund prestigious FP7 research grant . Our team , collaboration partner ( see ) take responsibility study presence , function clinical significance EPO-R human cancer specimen . General Aim Proposed Project : To study EPO-R human cancer specimen . Specific Aims : To detect EPO-R tumor cell To test EPO-R function To follow patient study possible correlation presence function EPO-R tumor specimens clinical outcome prognosis . Methods : The Retrospective Project : ( A waiver inform consent request January 1990 till December 2011 ) - Prepared slide already take preparation ( specimen ) serve basis part work . - When require , additional slide pathological `` block '' prepare . - The required specimen : 1 . Breast cancer - 50 ( 50 patient ) 2 . Colon cancer - 50 3 . Lung cancer - 50 4 . Head &amp; Neck cancer - 50 5 . Lymph node biopsy ( positive lymphoma ) - 50 The sample cancer tissue bronchoscopy , endoscopy FNA/FNB , small amount tissue , use study . - The unstained , non-identified , slide transfer Prof. Drorit Neumann 's laboratory , Sackler Faculty medicine , analysis slide EPO-R content perform . Part slide transfer Queens University , Belfast , Ireland test perform lab prof. Makswell . - The slide stain anti-EPO-R antibody ( Abs ) . These Abs generate part European EPO-CAN project Dr. John Thompson team Aldevron , Freiburg , Germany . - In order prepare formalin-fixed paraffin wax-embedded ( FFPE ) material , tissue sample fix 10 % buffer formalin overnight room temperature process graded alcohol paraffin wax . Once embed , 3-5µm section cut onto activate slide place 37°C incubator overnight . These ready immunohistochemistry . This standard methodology single section . For Tissue Microarrays ( TMAs ) select case identify region interest mark use haematoxylin eosin stain slide . The region core original block re-embedded accord establish map . Between 50 100 core sit per block . Serial 3-5µm section cut treated . Screening stain parameter optimisation antibody perform single section preparation . Selected antibody suitable FFPE material use stain TMAs normal malignant tissue range tumour , prepared Northern Ireland Biobank . Note : The information collection sample conduct anonymous technique separate irreversible way patient 's identification detail . The Prospective Project : ( Patient inform consent require ) - A similar work perform fresh material sample , take biopsy operate room . - Patients identify , 2-3 year follow-up clinical course attempt correlate course clinical outcome presence function EPO-R tumor cell . Note : Only small ( tiny ) piece patient tissue require . Thus , interfere activity assay require decision make process patient . There remain enough patient tissue storage future medicine test therapeutic goal .</detailed_description>
