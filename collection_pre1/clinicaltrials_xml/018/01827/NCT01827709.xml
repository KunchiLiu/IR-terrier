	<brief_summary>Chemo-radiotherapy ( CRT ) currently cornerstone management locoregional advance head neck cancer ( HNC ) . Optimization quality RT therefore important issue , investigator want improve therapeutic index HNC . This could achieve accurate definition tumor volume identification radioresistant volume within tumor . Recent literature put regard incorporation functional imaging ( FI ) RT treatment plan forward promise tool . FI modality provide outstanding contrast tumor surround tissue . This contrast anatomical imaging . Using anatomical image RT treatment planning , sufficient margin need place around tumor volume order compensate geometric uncertainty . Consequently many surround functional structure receive high dos irradiation , result side effect . It expect , use FI RT treatment plan make margin small even unnecessary , result less irradiation surround tissue . So far one study report comparison tumor volume anatomical ( CT MRI ) FI ( PET-CT ) modalities pathological tumor volume . This study show indeed tumor volume delineate PET-CT correlate tumor volume define pathology significantly small . Furthermore , FI provide u deep insight tumor 's underlying biological activity microstructure . These technique thus help identify radioresistant subvolumes might benefit treatment intensification . A validation FI modality pathology necessary investigate true power tumor delineation identification radioresistant subvolumes .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . BACKGROUND AND SETTING 1.1 . INTRODUCTION Concurrent ( chemo- ) radiotherapy ( CRT ) current standard care patient locally advanced head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) . The proximity important functional structure tumour make treatment however highly complex . Treatment related toxicity severe xerostomia dysphagia gravely complicate patient 's quality life . The use alter fractionation schedule and/or concurrent chemotherapy result substantial gain loco-regional control , lead significant improvement overall survival . Although prognosis patient treat RT locally advance HNSCC continually improve , still high number locoregional failure . Using highly conformal radiotherapy investigator increase therapeutic index give high dos radio-resistant part tumour maintain even reduce dose surround tissue . Functional image help u define radio-resistant subvolumes help u delineate gross tumour volume ( GTV ) good future . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) , Diffusion weight magnetic resonance imaging ( DWI ) Dynamic contrast enhance MRI ( DCE-MRI ) give u insight tumour 's underlaying biological microstructural characteristic . However , moment investigator sure interpret different image parameter obtain functional imaging modality . Therefore , investigator want correlate imaging parameter pathological characteristic tumour . On hand investigator want correlate GTV define functional imaging modality pathological GTV , see modality help u delineate GTV accurately future . 1.2 . IMAGING MODALITIES 1.2.1 . FDG-Positron Emission Tomography ( FDG-PET ) Increased glucose metabolism fundamental characteristic many malignant tumour , include HNSCC . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) injection radioactively label 2 ' fluorodeoxyglucose ( 18F-FDG ) help u measure quantify metabolism tumour , use standardize uptake value ( SUV ) . Several study correlate high SUV prior treatment significantly bad outcome HNSCC . Furthermore appear local recurrence occur within FDG-PET define GTV . The molecular base completely understood . Proliferating tumour cell consume glucose high rate release lactate CO2 . This way omit mitochondrion driven oxidative phosphorylation glucose production ATP ( =Warburg-effect ) . Several molecular parameter associate glycolytic switch , activation hypoxia induce HIF1α increase presence GLUT glucose transport protein . So far clear correlation find presence hypoxia FDG-uptake . 1.2.2 . Diffusion-weighted Magnetic resonance imaging ( DWI ) Diffusion weight magnetic resonance imaging ( DWI ) characterize tissue base random displacement water molecule . In biological tissue displacement limit underlying tissue-specific barrier difference quantify visualized use apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) value . A study 165 patient centre HNSCC demonstrate pre-treatment ADC value strong independent prognostic factor outcome . Patients high ADC value respond bad ionize radiation patient low ADC value . There currently clear explanation tumours high cellular density radiosensitive tumour low density . A number microscopic feature effect water diffusivity tissue ( presence necrosis , cellular density , inflammation , integrity cellular membrane ) . Many also affect radio- chemosensitivity tumour . 1.2.3 . Dynamic contrast enhance Magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE-MRI ) Dynamic contrast enhance MRI ( DCE-MRI ) non-invasive image modality develop evaluated characterization vascular property tissue . Adequate oxygen supply essential effectivity ionize radiation . However tumor angiogenesis far perfect newly form vessel display permeability , tortuosity generally poor functionality . These vascular property could provide u insight aggressiveness radiosensitivity tumor . Dynamic compute tomography ( CT ) demonstrate perfusion measurement predict outcome head neck cancer radiotherapy . Similarly quantitative assessment DCE-MRI also correlate response ionize radiation patient HNSCC . A recent trial limit number patient correlate certain DCE-MRI parameter intratumoural hypoxia . However , far spatial correlation do . 2 . STUDY OBJECTIVES 2.1 . PRIMARY OBJECTIVES The main objective study correlate DWI , DCE-MRI FDG-PET spatial distribution hypoxia patient head neck cancer . 2.2 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES A . To correlate finding functional image intrinsic molecular parameter depict proliferation , hypoxia glucose metabolism . B . To validate use hypoxia marker 15-gene hypoxia gene expression classifier . C. To compare tumour volume derive pathology volume delineate several anatomical functional imaging modality . 3 . STUDY DESIGN The target group trial patient histologically proven squamous cell carcinoma larynx , eligible surgery , stag T3-4 . Prior treatment patient undergo FDG-PET/CT MRI DW DCE , dedicate optimal visualization primary tumor analysis . The imaging modality perform close surgery possible ( PET/CT one week surgery ; MRI one day surgery ) . Prior treatment , three slice image modality select radiologist base visual quality heterogeneity functional parameter . These region interest compare different histopathological parameter resection specimen . The radiologist also select region , base DWI DCE parameter , suspect hypoxic . From region biopsy take . After total laryngectomy , resection specimen orient , biopsy material obtain region tumour select imaging modality The rest specimen fix formaldehyde . To account shrinkage tumour due fixation , resection specimen place cardboard box agarose solution scan MRI T1w/T2 image . From shrinkage factor calculate compare delineate T1 T2 weight image . After fixation tumour cut macroslices thickness 5mm . On macroslice tumour volume delineate . Using , pathological tumour volume determine take account previously determine shrinkage factor . This pathological volume compare tumour volume delineate imaging modality . On different pre-surgery functional imaging modality , 4 separate observer delineate GTV . The different volume compare overlap calculate 3D specimen reconstruction registration . The GTV obtain functional imaging correlate pathological tumor volume resection specimen . This information give u insight true power investigate functional imaging technique determine tumour volume . This important ass role functional image modality treatment planning future . At three level , choose radiologist image modality , 4µm thick slice take . On level immunohistochemical staining carry ( GLUT-1 , CA-IX , HIF-1α , VEGF KI 67 stain perform ) . IHC score accord semiquantitative scoring system use field analysis field assigend score 1-4 accord approximate area immunostaining ( 0:0 % , 1:1-5 % , 2 : 5-15 % , 3 : 15-30 % 4 : &gt; 30 % . 4 . SAMPLE SIZE Twenty patient squamous cell carcinoma larynx , plan undergo total laryngectomy , include .</detailed_description>
