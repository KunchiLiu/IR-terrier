	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Squamous cell carcinoma antigen ( SCCA ) protein strong homology family protease inhibitor know serpins . SCCAs cytoplasmic protein : find normal squamous epithelium , elevate level serum patient squamous cell carcinoma , especially case uterine cervix carcinoma , lung carcinoma , head neck squamous cell carcinoma . SCCA clinically useful , especially stag uterine cervix carcinoma ( risk lymph node metastasis ) . It also useful marker monitor follow-up therapy , increase SCCA level may predict carcinoma relapse . Recent study show close relationship SCCA sinonasal invert papilloma ( IP ) . IP relatively infrequent , benign sinonasal tumour . Careful long-term follow-up radical surgery necessary treating IP , owe malignant potential high recurrence rate . Distinguishing inflammatory change recurrence IP sometimes difficult . The purpose study determine benefit SCCA serum level evaluation patient IP . MATERIAL AND METHODS Study design This prospective study perform accordance Declaration Helsinki , criteria good clinical practice , applicable regulatory requirement . Written inform consent obtain participant initiation procedure . Patients IP treat Department Otolaryngology , Faculty Medicine , University Ostrava include study . At least three year follow-up surgery require inclusion patient study . Blood sample enrol patient examined determine serum SCCA level surgery , day surgery , every 6 month follow-up . Preoperative postoperative SCCA level compare . The change SCCA level follow-up evaluate . Biochemical analysis Serum SCCA level assay use immunofluorescence assay monoclonal antibody ( B.R.A.H.M.S SCC KRYPTOR kit , Hennigsdorf , Germany ) . The normal serum level SCC antigen 0-1.5 Âµg/l . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis correlation preoperative postoperative serum SCCA level perform use Student 's t-test pair data . Differences p &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
