	<brief_title>Avoidance Delirium Older Patients After Major Non-cardiac Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Delirium common postoperative complication elderly . The incidence depend several factor like comorbidities patient type surgery . Mortality almost twofold increase two year patient suffer delirium surgery . Different study show multimodal strategy possible reduce risk delirium . As several different organ system involve development delirium patient 's hemodynamic state seem important target point intervention . Also sufficient perfusion oxygen delivery essential order avoid impairment brain . Recent study show goal direct hemodynamic management reduce kind postoperative complication improve outcome . However , whether use goal-directed hemodynamic management also improve neurological outcome reduces rate postoperative delirium study yet . Aim study investigate impact goal direct hemodynamic management use pulse contour analysis incidence delirium old patient undergo non-cardiac surgery , present intermediate high risk delirium . This risk assess preoperatively use score suggest Marcantonio . Patients randomize one two group , goal-directed therapy group control group . In goal-directed therapy ( GDT ) group hemodynamic management perform accord establish algorithm obtain pulse contour analysis . To prove theory goal-directed therapy influence brain increase oxygen supply use near infrared spectroscopy , safe non-invasive , patient . The hemodynamic management continue recovery room intensive care unit accord mention algorithm . The intervention terminate soon patient fulfil standard criterion discharge recovery room intensive care . In control group hemodynamic management perform accord heart rate blood pressure without use extended monitoring . As actual incidence significant impact number need per group , go perform interim analysis 100 include patient accord O'Brian-Fleming technique . Is difference delirium two group significant α &lt; 0,002 study finish . Otherwise , sample size need per group determine assume α = 0,048 , two-tailed test power 80 % . UPDATE 19-10-2016 : The interims-analysis incidence 100 patient reveal , 86 patient per group need ( α = 0,048 , power 80 % ) .</detailed_description>
