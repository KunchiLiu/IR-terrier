	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Intranasal Topical Mupirocin Eradicating Colonization With Staphylococcus Aureus ( SA ) Critically Ill Infants - Phase 2 , Multi-Center , Open Label , Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , open label , multi-center , randomize trial determine safety efficacy mupirocin eradicate colonization Staphylococcus aureus ( SA ) prevent occurrence invasive clinically significant SA infection among critically ill infant ICU . Infants hospitalize ICU one 6 participating center positive nasal culture SA eligible enroll . Infants stratify birth gestational age ( &lt; 28 week &lt; 8 week post-natal life &gt; /= 28 week / &lt; 28 week &gt; /=8 week post-natal life ) colonize strain methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( MRSA ) methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ( MSSA ) randomize 1:1 receive 5 day course mupirocin apply naris , umbilicus perianal ( NUP ) area every 8 hour ( +/= 2 hour ) vs. treatment . ( Stratification birth gestational age perform minimize bias could result high risk develop infection due prematurity prolong length stay due prematurity . ) The primary objective study 1 ) evaluate safety clinical acceptability 5-day course mupirocin apply every 8 hour ( ± 2 hour ) naris , umbilical perianal area infant reside ICU 2 ) examine efficacy mupirocin eradicate SA colonization infant ICU , define absence SA culture naris , umbilical , perianal area day 8 ( ± 2 ) ( primary decolonization ) 3 ) examine efficacy mupirocin achieve persistent eradication SA colonization among infant reside ICU , define absence SA culture naris , umbilical , perianal area day 8 ( ±2 ) 22 ( ±2 ) ( persistent decolonization ) . The secondary objective study 1 ) To examine efficacy mupirocin prevent clinical SA infection day 1-22 discharge , whichever occur first , among SA colonize infant reside ICU 2 ) To compare time SA decolonization mupirocin placebo group : Time Day 1 first NUP collection SA detect naris , umbilical , perianal area 3 ) To examine whether mupirocin affect frequency non-SA clinical infection compare frequency infection treatment control group 85 day observation period 4 ) To examine whether mupirocin affect frequency severe ( stage II-III ) necrotizing enterocolitis compare frequency occurrence treatment control group 85 day observation period . Each participant enrol 12 week ( Day 85 ) time discharge hospital , death withdrawal participation , whichever occur first . It anticipate take least 2 year enroll participant . Study duration 36 month . Enrolled infant continue receive medical care otherwise would enrol trial . The study power toward primary endpoint 126 participant . Enrollment may continue maximum 500 participant inform secondary exploratory endpoint help design subsequent study .</detailed_description>
