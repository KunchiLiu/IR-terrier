	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn combination ipilimumab ABI-007 ( abraxane ) help control metastatic melanoma . The safety drug combination also study . Ipilimumab design increase immune system 's ability fight cancer . Abraxane design stop cancer cell make new DNA ( genetic material cell ) . This may stop cancer cell divide new cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Abraxane Plus Ipilimumab Patients With Metastatic Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive ABI-007 vein 30 minute Days 1 , 8 , 15 28-day cycle . During first 3 month receive abraxane , also receive ipilimumab . You receive ipilimumab vein 90 minute . You receive 4 time , time 3 week apart . You give standard drug help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . Study Tests : Every week , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . Before cycle abraxane : - Your performance status record . - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn routine test . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon ) drawn test immune system ( first 3 cycle ) . - You ask drug may take side effect may . - If able become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine pregnancy test . Every 8 week ( +/- 7 day ) , chest x-ray CT scan MRI scan perform check status disease . Length Study : You may receive ipilimumab 3 month . You may continue take abraxane long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad intolerable side effect occur . If stop receiving study drug reason , End-of-Treatment Visit . End-of-Treatment Visit : Within 14 day stop study treatment , come clinic End-of-Treatment Visit . At visit , follow test perform : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - You ask drug may take side effect may . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If study doctor think best interest , CT scan MRI scan check side effect . Every 2 month 6 month , every 3 month 2 year , also contact telephone routine clinic visit see . If call , call last 5 minute . This investigational study . Ipilimumab FDA approve commercially available treatment metastatic melanoma . abraxane FDA approve commercially available treatment metastatic breast cancer . It investigational use abraxane , either alone combination ipilimumab , treatment metastatic melanoma . Up 64 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
