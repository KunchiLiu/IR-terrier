	<brief_title>Sutent Rechallenge In mRCC Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A sample size n = 40 patient allow estimate median PFS precision around 1.8 month ( base data Rini et al . ) This retrospective prospective study design estimate effect Sutent rechallenge . The PFS ( estimate Kaplan-Meier estimate ) primary endpoint . In addition , effect sunitinib 2 period treatment ( i.e . first line sunitinib vs. rechallenge ) compare Wilcoxon signed-rank test PFS value McNemar test overall response rate ( ORR ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically document metastatic RCC contain predominantly clear cell component . Previously receive sunitinib first line , 2 antitumor therapy subsequently receive sunitinib second time . At least 1 cycle sunitinib rechallenge ( 1 cycle= 4 week on/2 week ) . At least 1 measurable lesion accurately measure least 1 dimension long diameter ( LD ) ³ 10 mm measure spiral computerize tomography ( CT ) ( 5mm slice thickness contiguous ) ³ 20 mm measure conventional CT ( 10mm slice thickness contiguous ) . The lesion must ³ 2 time size slice thickness per RECIST criterion . Life expectancy least 3 month . Patient n't receive Sunitinib first line . Patient receive less one line treatment .</criteria>
