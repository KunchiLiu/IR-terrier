	<brief_title>Comparison Immune Responses Influenza Vaccine In Adults Different Ages</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>At initial study visit year , volunteer provide information current health health history . Vital sign assesed volunteer immunize current licensed seasonal influenza vaccine . Follow-up visit conduct Day 6-8 Day 28 , phone call 6 month post-immunization . A blood sample collect pre-immunization follow-up visit . Volunteers follow 8 year . Our main effort survey elderly young control subject response influenza vaccination use functional cellular array technology . We compare result serum antibody response day 28 blood sample measure hemagglutination inhibition ( HAI ) titer vaccination strain . This accepted standard determine whether effective antibody response influenza vaccine antigen . In addition , follow-up subject yearly phone ask whether experienced influenza-like illness episode serious adverse event follow immunization . In way , able correlate accept standard assay appropriate antibody response influenza vaccination new assay , also begin hope valuable longitudinal study immune responsiveness elderly . We also think T-cell array `` signature '' immune senescence term number respond cell cytokine profile allow rapid read-out condition ( day 6-8 vaccination ) give mechanistic clue regard phenomenon . In addition , want obtain much information possible sample thus propose follow assay : - Subject Analysis - We use fluorescence activate cell sort determine precise number white blood cell type give patient sample activation state ( B cell , T cell , NK cell , gamma-delta T cell , monocyte , dendritic cell ) . We particularly interest whether report increase CD8+CD28- T cell decrease gamma-delta T cell correlate immunosenescence . This subset analysis also important normalize gene expression data . - Gene Expression Analysis- We collect part blood sample PAX gene tube prepare probe mRNA gene expression analysis use Agilent microarrays survey global gene expression . This tell u particular `` gene expression signature '' correlate immune senescence . - Serum Cytokine Analysis - As report change serum cytokine repertoire old people , survey serum sample 26 different cytokine use Panomics/Luminex system run Human Immune Monitoring Center Stanford . - Monocyte Activation Potential - As antigen presentation capacity may also variable influence robustness adaptive immune response , Year 1 examine circulate monocyte source antigen present cell . We examine potential cell respond vitro activate stimulus ( cytokine LPS ) measure expression cell surface activation marker ( DR , CD86 , CD40 ) intracellular phosphoprotein ( eg . pp38 , pSTATs ) . Expression marker measure FACS analysis .</detailed_description>

Recent current use systemic immunosuppressive medication , include glucocorticoid ( corticosteroid nasal spray inhale steroid permissible ) . Use oral steroid ( &lt; 20mg prednisoneequivalent/day ) may acceptable review investigator . Autoimmune disease ( include rheumatoid arthritis treat immunosuppressive medication Plaquenil , methotrexate , prednisone , Enbrel ) , opinion investigator , might jeopardize volunteer safety compliance protocol . History blood dyscrasia hemoglobinopathy require regular medical follow hospitalization precede year Use anticoagulation medication Coumadin Lovenox , antiplatelet agent aspirin , Plavix , Aggrenox must review investigator determine would affect volunteer 's safety . Receipt blood blood product within past 6 month Medical psychiatric condition occupational responsibility preclude subject compliance protocol Receipt inactivate vaccine within 14 day prior vaccination Receipt live , attenuate vaccine within 60 day vaccination History GuillainBarr√© Syndrome Pregnant lactate woman Use investigational agent within 30 day prior enrollment Donation equivalent unit blood within 6 week prior enrollment Any condition , opinion investigator , might interfere volunteer safety , study objective ability participant understand comply study protocol .</criteria>
