	<brief_summary>The purpose clinical trial evaluate safety immunogenicity female volunteer EN41-UGR7C vaccine candidate adjuvanted Alum use IM administration . The objective immunisation induce mucosal systemic binding neutralize antibody HIV order block virus mucosal surface neutralise viral particle may eventually succeed cross mucosal barrier . This Phase 1 exploratory study . EN41-UGR7C administer first time human . Volunteers vaccinate EN41-UGR7C may develop immune response HIV , ability induce meaningful protection HIV know Phase 3 efficacy trial complete , correlate protection HIV yet clearly define . Consequently , direct benefit volunteer . They reimburse time travel .</brief_summary>
