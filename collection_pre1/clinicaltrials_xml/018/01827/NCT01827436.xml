	<brief_summary>The purpose pilot research study 1 . To begin test two different type physical therapy might different result child adolescent prior stroke , 2 . To determine either type physical therapy cause change brain signal control leg muscle . All participant receive physical therapy 3 time per week 8 week . Half participant receive typical physical therapy , walk practice , muscle strengthening , balance training . Half participant receive asymmetrical gait train physical therapy , use new technology train leg differently walk practice . After enrol , participant randomly assign type therapy . Measurements take , , 8 week physical therapy . These include walking test measure symmetry , walk speed daily step activity , brain test measure strength signal brain leg muscle . One blood test also take identify certain genetic factor affect child responds physical therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Effective rehabilitation acquire brain injury essential reduce impact lead cause pediatric disability United States . Neuroplastic change response physical therapy likely different child compare adult child continue experience developmental brain maturation also experience neural change associate injury rehabilitation . The interaction two process poorly understand presumably critical maximizing long term outcome . Using biomarkers measure predict rehabilitation-induced change improve rehabilitation prognosis facilitate development rehabilitation intervention optimize neuroplastic potential child . The objective pilot study investigate motor neural response two different rehabilitation program child adolescent chronic hemiplegia prior stroke . Participants randomly assign receive conventional physical therapy asymmetrical gait training program . Conventional physical therapy include activity gait balance training muscle strengthen . The asymmetrical gait training program use new technology train leg different speed walking practice . Measurements motor neural function occur five timepoints , treatment . Motor function measure include gait symmetry ratio , walk speed , community step activity , participant caregiver rating self-identified walking goal . Neural measure include motor response characteristic muscle contraction elicit two low extremity muscle transcranial magnetic stimulation injure cortex . We also establish genetic database identify presence absence two genetic variant [ Apolipoprotein E ( ApoE Ð„4 ) val66met Brain-derived neurotropic factor ( BDNF ) polymorphisms ] associate decreased potential neuroplasticity planning future investigation . The result use inform design large study evaluate physical therapy treatment maximize capacity child 's brain change neurological injury identify predictor rehabilitation-induced neuroplasticity child .</detailed_description>
