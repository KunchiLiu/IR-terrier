	<brief_title>ExAblate Transcranial MR Guided Focused Ultrasound Treatment Essential Tremors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluate new technique perform Thalamotomy tremor control . While current technique possible invasive radiation effect , use ExAblate totally non-invasive without radiation . After informed consent screening , eligible subject randomize either ExAblate treatment ExAblate Sham `` fake '' procedure . The chance randomization Sham one four . Subjects randomize Sham Control undergo procedure follow-up visit Month 3 visit . After Month 3 assessment complete , subject unblinded Sham treat group option actual ExAblate treatment unblinded fashion , long still qualify ExAblate treatment . All subject follow 6 12 month 5 year direct doctor .</detailed_description>
