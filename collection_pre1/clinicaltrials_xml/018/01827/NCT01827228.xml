	<brief_summary>Half HIV transmission event may occur within period high infectivity ( often high risk behavior ) last 11 month person initially infect . Unfortunately , neither test-and-treat intervention method Acute HIV Infection project find effective way intervene transmission risky `` recent infection '' period . The investigator seek develop effective intervention technique HIV transmission recent infection period use combination injection- , sexual- social-network-based contact trace method ; community alert network venue recent infectees ; logic go `` '' `` '' infection chain . The investigator first Aim develop evaluate way locate `` seed , '' define drug user people recently infect . The investigator second Aim target member seed ' network people attend venue . The investigator test acute recent infection , alert probability network contain highly-infectious member reduce risk transmission behavior next several month minimize chance get infect . This may also reduce transmission untested people recent infection . Community , network venue education need value support recent infection reduce stigma . The investigator third Aim reduce HIV transmission develop new way evaluate `` prevention positive '' generally well The investigator success reduce transmission . The investigator use combination follow-up interview test , include viral load ; phylogenetic technique ; discrete event simulation model ass The investigator effectiveness .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>TRIP Design This exploratory research project . It aim develop TRIP model preparation phase 3 clinical trial random assignment geographic area intervention versus control condition . Since TRIP exploratory , design element may vary . And multiple outcomes.. TRIP three arm : 1 . The Recent infection network trace ( primary ) arm ; 2. Contact trace HIV+ ' recently infect comparison arm ; 3. HIV negative comparison arm . Before investigator start main part intervention , intervention well , investigator use available mean educate at-risk community nature acute recent HIV infection reason stigmatize recently infect . 1 . The Recent infection network trace ( primary ) arm This primary arm intervention . It include index subject two kind : a. people test screened turn recent HIV infection ( LAg+ ) . b . People refer u clinicians recent acute HIV infection . It also include network/venue member index subject . These consist 1 . People social and/or risk network people recently become infected HIV ; 2 . People go `` venue '' —i.e. , place people recently become infected HIV say sometimes go order engage drug take sexual risk behavior meet people take risk . Network trace recruit direct contact Index Cases also network/venue member contact . ( The investigator may continue third network ring seem warrant part exploratory nature project ) . Network/venue member test recent acute HIV perhaps diseases . Each time network/venue member find recent acute HIV infection investigator ( network/venue tracing purpose ) treat index case sense investigator trace network/venue contact . Participants primary arm intervention test HIV+ refer medical evaluation treatment . People recent acute infection receive expedite schedule doctor appointment receive direct assistance get doctor 's office need . They also get extra assistance receive social assistance . Whenever investigator find acute recent infection , assistance investigator distribute oral write `` community alert '' warn people network venue super-careful behavior next 6 month social environment include people highly infectious ; tell safer ; repeat importance assist rather stigmatize anyone suspect recently become infected . 2 . Contact trace HIV+ people recently infect comparison arm This comparison arm start 50 subject city HIV test part screen process antibody positive LAg negative—and report learn HIV antibody status time . investigator recruit sexual injection partner , risk environment contact , two step , Arm 1 . If investigator get recent/acute set , investigator follow another two step . ( In analysis , investigator also study subset investigator would recruit via conventional contact tracing—i.e. , would recruit investigator stop follow network whenever investigator come someone uninfected . ) In case , one key comparison number recents &amp; acute find contact trace vs. network recent . In addition , investigator compare comparison group non-recent HIV+ network member TRIP group recently-infected people network behavior change adverse/supporting event . 3 . HIV negative comparison arm This comparison arm consist 150 uninfected people city investigator screen course test . The key comparison two central variable : adverse/supportive event behavior change . This comparison arm help mitigate social desirability effect lead inaccurate reporting and/or Hawthorne effect related process lead behavior change simply base interview . Participants arm match age ( within five year ) , risk group , gender Arm 1 member . Assays category subject Negative screenees ( HIV- ) : N=150 Baseline : They test HIV antibody Aristotle project ( HIV- ) . Follow : They test HIV antibody TRIP project . If HIV- , test . If HIV+ confirm WB ( seroconverters ) , also test use LAg HIV RNA TRIP . If HIV+ confirm WB ( seroconverters ) , investigator presume recently infect ( investigator look LAg HIV RNA change investigator treat . That , investigator treat seed find recent . However , analytically , possible first negative test negative error , investigator analyze later ) . Long-term positive screenees ( HIV+ , LAg- ) : N=50 Baseline : They test baseline HIV antibody ( HIV+ ) Aristotle project LAg ( negatives-LAg- ) TRIP . Follow-up : No test . HIV RNA data obtain clinical record , available . Contact tracing : All trace contact test HIV antibody TRIP . HIV positive ( HIV+ , confirm WB ) : They test LAg TRIP . HIV positive ( HIV+ , confirm WB ) also LAg positive ( LAg+ ) : They test HIV RNA TRIP . HIV positive ( HIV+ , confirm WB ) LAg negative ( LAg- ) : No test . HIV negative ( HIV- ) : No test ( store freezer possible HIV RNA test future ) . Follow-up network/venue member long-term positive screenees : Long-term positive baseline ( HIV+ confirm WB , LAg- ) : HIV RNA info collection clinical record . Recently infect baseline ( HIV+ confirm WB , LAg+ and/or HIV RNA+ ) : HIV RNA info collection clinical record . Negatives baseline ( HIV- ) : HIV test . If HIV positive ( HIV+ confirm WB ) , LAg test HIV RNA TRIP . If HIV- , investigator stop . If HIV+ confirm WB ( seroconverters ) , investigator presume recently infect ( investigator look LAg HIV RNA change investigator treat . That , investigator treat seed find recent . However , analytically , possible first negative test negative error , investigator analyze later ) . Recently infect screenees ( HIV+ , LAg+ ) : N=unknown Baseline : They test baseline HIV antibodies Aristotle project ( HIV+ ) , LAg ( positives-LAg+ ) ; know LAG+ , test HIV RNA ( + ) TRIP . Follow-up : HIV RNA TRIP collect info clinical record . Then investigator stop . Network/venue member : All test HIV antibody TRIP . HIV positive ( HIV+ confirm WB ) : They test LAg TRIP . HIV positive ( HIV+ confirm WB ) LAg positive ( LAg+ ) : They test HIV RNA TRIP . HIV positive ( HIV+ confirm WB ) LAg negative ( LAg- ) : No test . HIV negative ( HIV- ) : They test pool use HIV RNA ( batch test ) TRIP . Follow-up network/venue member : Long-term positive baseline ( HIV+ confirm WB , LAg- ) : HIV RNA info collection clinical record . Recently infect baseline ( HIV+ confirm WB , LAg+ and/or HIV RNA+ ) : HIV RNA info collection clinical record . Negatives baseline ( HIV- , LAg- , HIV RNA- ) : HIV test . If HIV positive follow-up ( HIV+ confirm WB ) , LAg test HIV RNA TRIP . If HIV- , investigator stop . If HIV+ confirm WB ( seroconverters ) , investigator presume recently infect ( investigator look LAg HIV RNA change investigator treat . That , investigator treat seed find recent . However , analytically , possible first negative test negative error , investigator analyze later ) .</detailed_description>
