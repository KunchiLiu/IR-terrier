WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 , everolimus , trametinib drug target specific variation tumor block different protein need cell growth . Veliparib block enzyme help repair deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) damage chemotherapy , may help chemotherapy drug work well .

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare response rate ( complete response [ CR ] plus partial response [ PR ] ) 4-month progression-free survival ( PFS ) treatment agent choose base presence specific mutation patient tumor response rate treatment agent choose complementary set agent identify target mutation interest . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients assign 1 4 treatment regimen correspond one mutation/amplification category . Patients may cross second mutation/amplification determine regimen within Arm A , one , upon disease progression . REGIMEN I : Patients receive veliparib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-7 temozolomide PO daily ( QD ) day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . REGIMEN II : Patients receive WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 PO BID 5 dos start day 1 carboplatin intravenously ( IV ) 30-60 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . REGIMEN III : Patients receive everolimus PO QD day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . REGIMEN IV : Patients receive trametinib PO QD day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients assign 1 4 treatment regimen Arm A complementary set ( correspond one mutation category ) . Patients may cross Arm A upon disease progression . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day . Patients unacceptable toxicity resolve day 30 follow biweekly stabilization resolution .</detailed_description>
