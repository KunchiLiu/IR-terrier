	<brief_summary>SUMMARY Rationale : Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) rapidly progressive disorder associate high mortality rate , despite medical intervention . With availability effective therapy , early disease detection important strategic objective improve treatment outcome . Resting echocardiography currently recommend screen modality high-risk population group . However , clear abnormality rest hemodynamics ( symptom ) late sequelae pathobiological process begin distal pulmonary artery . Exercise stress may unmask early pulmonary vascular dysfunction , however definition , clinical significance , natural history 'exercise PAH ' remain undefined . However , base clinical experience literature prevalence estimate ~ 20 % .Treatment endothelin receptor blocker show beneficial influence clinical performance patient exercise induced PAH due systemic sclerosis primary pulmonary hypertension . Whether endothelin receptor blocker decrease pulmonary pressure improve clinical outcome patient exercise induced pulmonary arterial hypertension due congenital heart disease unknown . Objective : Identify congenital heart disease patient exercise-induced pulmonary arterial hypertension . Analyze change pulmonary arterial pressure peak exercise patient exercise induce pulmonary arterial hypertension treatment bosentan , compare placebo . Study design : Randomized placebo control trial study period 26 week . Study population : Adult congenital heart disease patient exercise induced pulmonary arterial hypertension ( n=40 ) Academic Medical Centre , Amsterdam . Intervention : After randomization one group ( n=20 ) receive 125 mg tablet Bosentan twice daily 6 month . The group ( n=20 ) receive placebo 6 month . Main study parameters/endpoints : To determine wether bosentan ( endothelin receptor inhibitor ) decrease mean pulmonary arterial pressure peak exercise adult congenital heart disease patient exercise induced pulmonary arterial hypertension . Furthermore change cardiopulmonary exercise capacity right ventricular function investigate . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : All investigation , blood analysis except , non-invasive free risk . The burden patient mainly consist time consumed investigation , namely : history take + physical examination ( 15 min ) ; Quality-of-Life- score ( 15 min ) ; laboratory test ( electrolyte , creatinine , urea , albumin neurohormone , troponin T ) ; 12 lead electrocardiogram ( 10 min ) ; exercise echocardiography ( 30 min ) ; cardiovascular exercise testing ( 30 min ) . The trial medication potential risk liver damage , monitor regularly laboratory test liver transaminase .</brief_summary>
