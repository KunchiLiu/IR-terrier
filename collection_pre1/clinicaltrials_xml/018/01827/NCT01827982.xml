	<brief_title>A Study Investigate Safety , Tolerability Pharmacokinetics JNJ-54861911 Healthy Volunteers Compared With Placebo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study first-in-human , double-blind ( neither investigator participant know treatment participant receives ) , randomize ( participant assign different treatment base chance ) , placebo-controlled ( placebo inactive substance compare drug test whether drug real effect clinical trial ) , single-ascending dose study . The study design evaluate safety ( side effect ) , tolerability pharmacokinetics ( drug absorb body , distribute within body , remove body time , ie , body drug ) , pharmacodynamics ( drug body ) JNJ-54861911 currently develop treatment Alzheimer 's Disease . The study population consist approximately 64 healthy participant divide among approximately 8 cohort ( small group ) . Each cohort 8 participant . For participant study consist 3 phase : screening phase ( 28 2 day prior first dose administration ) , double-blind treatment phase , follow-up examination ( within 7 14 day last dose administration ) . Participants successfully complete screen examination consider eligible participate admit clinical unit Day -1 administration study drug remain unit evening Day 3 . The double-blind treatment phase consist three part : Part 1 ( Cohorts 1 3 ) single ascend dose part young healthy male participant , 18 54 year age . Part 2 ( Cohorts 4 7 ) single-ascending dose part elderly male female participant 55 75 year age include continuous cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) sampling . Within Parts 1 2 study , participant randomize ( assigned chance ) treatment JNJ-54861911 ( n=6/cohort ) match placebo ( n=2/cohort ) . Following dose level , observed safety tolerability profile evaluate . If side effect observe pharmacokinetic data roughly line predict safe value , dose escalate . Each participant next cohort give high dose JNJ-54861911 . As general safety precaution first-in-human study , dose administration Part 1 , Cohort 1 cohort stagger . Part 1 study primarily focus determine safety tolerability JNJ-54861911 single ascend dose administration understand primary pharmacokinetic characteristic JNJ-54861911 . In addition possible pharmacodynamic effect JNJ-54861911 plasma amyloid beta ( Aβ ) level explore . The primary focus Part 2 determine maximal tolerate dose level JNJ-54861911 determine safety tolerability maximum feasible exposure level , whichever reach first healthy elderly participant . In addition reduction CSF Aβ 36 hour post single dose administration JNJ-54861911 explore . Planned dose 1 mg , 3 mg , 9 mg , 27 mg , 81 mg , 160 mg JNJ- 54861911 match placebo , administer single oral dose . The start dose JNJ-54861911 Part 2 dose level test Part 1 find safe well tolerate , expect reduce CSF Aβ 20 percent . The initial dose test Part 2 high dos test Part 1 . Part 3 ( Cohort 8 ) study evaluate effect food JNJ-54861911 absorbed , distribute within body , remove body . One single dose JNJ-54861911 matching placebo test consumption high fat breakfast . The dose JNJ-54861911 test part derive result obtain Parts 1 2 . Part 3 may perform parallel Part 1 2 study . Depending pharmacokinetic property safety tolerability profile JNJ-54861911 , young elderly healthy participant may recruit part . In addition male participant enrol Part 1 Part 2 may also enrol Part 3 . Participants discharge clinical unit last study assessment Day 3 obtain . Participants discharge opinion investigator safe participant discharge . The participant return clinical unit Day 4 ( 72 h post dose ) Day 5 ( 96 h post dose ) plasma PK sampling . Safety assessment perform throughout study . The maximal study duration participant exceed 6 week .</detailed_description>
