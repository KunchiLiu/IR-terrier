	<brief_summary>This research study phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test effectiveness drug learn whether drug work treat specific cancer . Eribulin chemotherapy approve US FDA November 2010 treat patient metastatic breast cancer receive least two prior chemotherapy regimen . It work interfere cancer cell division , growth spread . In research study , investigator look see well Eribulin help participant metastatic breast cancer first-line second-line chemotherapy treatment . The investigator also would like learn side-effects participant experience medication , particular , neuropathy . Neuropathy condition nerve affect , lead numbness tingle finger toe . The investigator would like study effect Eribulin nerve regular questionnaire ask nerve-related symptom . The investigator also plan send blood sample determine gene marker may indicate increased sensitivity nerve effect Eribulin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If willing participate study ask undergo screening test procedure confirm eligibility . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn take part research study . If test procedure recently , may may repeat . The screening test procedure include : medical history , physical examination vital sign , performance status , assessment tumor , routine blood test , pregnancy test electrocardiogram . If test show eligible participate research study , begin study treatment . If meet eligibility criterion , able participate research . If take part research study , give Eribulin intravenous infusion ( vein ) . The time complete single treatment 60 minute . You receive Eribulin Day 1 Day 8 cycle . In third week ( Day 15 ) receive study medication . Each complete treatment cycle last 3 week . During cycle physical exam ask question general health specific question problem might medication may take . At begin cycle 1,2,3 every subsequent cycle , ask complete three online questionnaire use wireless tablet computer provide clinic see . This well establish method administer electronic questionnaire . No data store computer . The data transmit server data securely store . Your data submit use special identification number . You give username password . You give detailed instruction use computer enter data . If wireless tablet computer work , paper form provide . It take 15-30 minute complete . Some question ask answer may make feel uncomfortable . You may choose answer question make feel uncomfortable . We assess tumor appropriate imaging modality ( e.g. , CT scan MRI ) every 9 week . About 4 tablespoon blood drawn measure blood count , organ function , safety reason . Blood test do Day 1 Day 8 every treatment cycle ( every three week ) . One additional tube blood ( 1 teaspoon ) collect Day 1 use good understand nerve toxicity chemotherapy use future research breast cancer . You follow-up visit three week stop study treatment . During visit , physical exam , well assessment side effect current medication . If continue on-going side effect relate study treatment , continue follow side effect resolve . About 4 tablespoon blood drawn measure blood count organ function . If stop therapy side effect cancer control , continue follow scan every 9 week cancer growth observe .</detailed_description>
