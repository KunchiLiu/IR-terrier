	<detailed_description>The role vitamin D deficiency increase risk fall physical dysfunction unclear . It also unclear take vitamin D improve physical function reduces fall risk old adult . This study look potential effect take vitamin D regularly fall physical function older adult . A total 50 individual low vitamin D level ( i.e. , serum 25-hydroxy Vitamin D range 10 ng/mL 30 ng/mL ) recent fall history enrol six-month study . During 6 month study , participant receive capsule contain 800 IU vitamin D , non-childproof bottle , two 3-month period . Participants ask consume one capsule per day duration six-month study , well attend four study visit : Screening Visit , Baseline Visit , 3-Month Visit ( approximately 3 month baseline visit ) , 6-Month Visit ( approximately 6 month baseline visit ) . During screen visit , participant fill questionnaire , complete mini-mental status exam , blood pressure pulse take , small sample blood drawn vein . During baseline visit , participant fill questionnaire , blood pressure , pulse , height , weight , waist circumference take , perform several measure physical function . Finally , mouth swab perform staff member collect stool sample bring study visit . During 3-Month Visit , participant complete questionnaire blood pressure pulse take .
