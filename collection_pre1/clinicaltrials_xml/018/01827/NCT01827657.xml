	<brief_summary>This single-dose , open-label , two part , parallel group study . This study conduct determine pharmacokinetics , safety tolerability GSK2336805 subject vary degree hepatic impairment . Part 1 study enroll subject mild moderate hepatic impairment healthy control subject match subject moderate hepatic impairment category . The decision commence Part 2 base review preliminary safety pharmacokinetic data subject moderate hepatic impairment . Part 2 enroll subject severe hepatic impairment . Additionally , base emergent data Part 1 , match control severe hepatic group may enrol ( optional ) . Due potential difficulty identify eligible subject severe hepatic impairment , study may stop prior full enrollment Part 2 , provide minimum 4 evaluable subject severe hepatic impairment enrol . The study consist Screening visit , single dose Treatment Period Follow-up visit . Subjects screen eligibility criterion within 30 day enrolment . Subjects admit clinical unit Day -1 ; subject receive single dose GSK2336805 Day 1 remain clinical unit 5 day ( check-out Day 4 ) . The follow-up visit conduct within 7-10 day Day 1 dosing .</brief_summary>
