	<brief_summary>Total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) procedure associate perioperative blood loss , require blood transfusion patient . The major cause blood loss due surgical trauma induces clot cascade fibrinolysis . Several previous study meta-analyses show tranexamic acid effective antifibrinolytic agent reduces blood loss variety situation . Tranexamic acid give intravenous form extensively study show efficacious cardiothoracic , spine surgical procedure well total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) THA . Similarly , topical tranexamic acid associate decreased blood loss cardiac surgery well . Recently , result prospective randomize study topical use tranexamic acid total knee arthroplasty find effective reduce postoperative blood loss . Taking consideration propose study evaluate effect topical application tranexamic acid postoperative blood loss blood transfusion patient undergoing total hip arthroplasty . The aim study evaluate efficacy topical application tranexamic acid blood loss patient undergoing primary unilateral total hip arthroplasty .</brief_summary>
