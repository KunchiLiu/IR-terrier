	<brief_summary>Background : - Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) treatment control amount virus blood , provide cure . The reason HIV treatment cure infection well understood . HIV persist blood cell year , even people receive treatment . In addition , HIV infection lead activate immune system , cause problem . - One theory HIV infection cause immune activation involve intestinal tract . HIV infect immune cell intestine soon infection damage immune barrier . This damage let bacteria cross bloodstream , lead ongoing inflammation . Even person HIV feel well , chronic inflammation may affect immune system . Researchers want see antibiotic Rifaximin reduce inflammation . Rifaximin design stay inside digestive system , affect bacteria intestine . Objectives : - To see Rifaximin reduce bacteria-related inflammation people HIV . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age HIV infection take medication treat . Design : - Participants screen physical exam , blood test , medical history . - Participants take either Rifaximin placebo 4 week . They medication 4 6 week , take drug 4 week . - During study , participant frequent blood urine test . They also provide stool sample . Liver kidney function test perform . HIV viral load ( amount virus blood ) also study . - Participants final follow-up visit additional 4 week . - Two additional test optional study participant : - Two blood draw : one third day start Rifaximin , one third day start placebo . - Up three colonoscopy low intestine biopsy intestine . These study collect sample intestinal tract look effect Rifaximin study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The introduction antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) result dramatic reduction AIDSrelated morbidity mortality . Therapy curative , however , nature HIV replication therapy remain unclear . Understanding mechanism involve HIV persistence useful identify effective strategy HIV eradication . Immune activation ( IA ) play central role pathogenesis HIV-infection , may play critical role HIV persistence therapy . In comparison level detect HIV uninfected subject , cellular marker activation biomarkers inflammation elevate HIV-infected individual . Levels inflammatory cytokine cellular marker activation independently correlate disease progression HIV-infected subject . Chronic , persistent IA associate observed CD4 depletion untreated subject among ART- treat virologically suppress subject may contribute failure reconstitute CD4 count . IA also play role pathogenesis non-AIDS related complication chronic kidney coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . Although chronic persistent IA may play role HIV persistence , source immune activation unknown . Low level viremia may represent virologic stimulus IA . Viremia persist low level therapy , know whether HIV infection maintain ongoing cycle replication sanctuary site , production long-lived cell integrate provirus , . Using sensitive assay HIV-1 viremia , others detect presence persistent HIV viremia majority subject throughout prolonged antiretroviral therapy . Drug intensification study suggest little contribution active replication level persistent viremia , suggest factor complete cycle HIV replication may contribute HIV-1 persistence . Activation HIV-1 long-lived cell reservoir sit another potential source viremia , nature reservoir yet well understood . The mechanism immune activation HIV infection remain clarified likely multifactorial . Additional potential mechanism persistence include central role gastrointestinal tract . The gastrointestinal epithelium gut-associated lymphoid tissue ( GALT ) think represent important barrier microbial translocation , HIV infection result substantial destruction barrier . The reservoir bacteria gastrointestinal tract substantial , small amount bacterial product report translocate across gastrointestinal tract bloodstream ; microbial translocation across defective GALT important driver observe immune activation HIV infection . The precise effect ART gut microbial translocation remain uncertain ; study suggest ART incompletely reverse effect microbial translocation , others fail demonstrate effect , yet study demonstrate complete reversal ART . In study , examine potential role bacterial translocation IA study effect antibiotic rifaximin marker microbial translocation , immune activation , HIV viremia gut reservoir ART treat aviremic subject . Rifaximin orally administer antibiotic potent qualitative quantitative effect gut bacterial flora . Rifaximin systemically absorb , drug effect appear confine gastrointestinal tract . Rifaximin study maintenance therapy inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) hepatic encephalopathy ( HE ) , disease state endogenous gut flora play important role pathogenesis . It anticipate use rifaximin result alteration reduction gut bacterial flora . We hypothesize reduction gut bacterial flora result correspond reduction bacterial translocation reduction biologically active LPS level lead reduction immune aced person receive Ativation , HIV . In protocol , role gut microbial translocation pathogenesis HIV infection examine perform randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study rifaximin case cross-over design virologically-suppressed HIV-infected person receive ART .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>PARTICIPANT INCLUSION CRITERIA : Patients agree course research study record review following element evaluate exist record : age , history HIV infection , ART history viral load prior inform consent , else element assess informed consent . All blood draw assess eligibility complete obtain informed consent . To participate study criterion list need meet . 1 . Subjects must 18 year age old . 2 . Able willing provide write informed consent 3 . Must history document HIV infection . 4 . HIV infection previously document host institution need document plasma HIV RNA viral load , rapid HIV test license ELISA test confirm another test use different method rapid HIV test , Western Blot , HIV culture , HIV antigen , HIV proviral DNA time prior study entry . 5 . ART treat subject virologically suppress great equal 3 year ( 1095 day ) . To meet criterion document viral load 3 year ( 1095 day ) prior screen visit must lower limit detection [ LLD ] use FDAapproved standard assay ( i.e . &lt; 50 copies/mL ) follow clarification : In three prior year , subject experience single blip [ i.e . viral load low limit detection , LLD ] may include provide satisfy follow criterion : blip 200 copies/ml , blip surround ( i.e precede succeed viral load ) undetectable HIV1 RNA level measurement . That viral load must LLD EXCEPT one blip . In 12 month period . 6 . Viral RNA level &lt; 50 c/ml Screen 1 . 7 . A minimum 2 HIV1 RNA level low limit detection use standard assay require 12 month period prior screen visit . As assay characteristic across site vary , LLD assay use define whether subject suppress . 8 . Stable dose statin therapy 6 month receive statin therapy . 9 . No known allergy contraindication use rifamycin compound rifampin , rifabutin rifaximin . . 10 . The effect rifaximin develop human fetus unknown , therefore subject must willing use two method contraception ( one must barrier method ) study period . Adequate method birth control include : tubal ligation , hysterectomy , condom ( male female ) without spermicide ; diaphragm cervical cap spermicide ; intrauterine device ; method require prescription ( contraceptive pill patch , Norplant , DepoProvera , others ) male partner previously undergone vasectomy . The following element assess blood draw obtain informed consent . 1 . Absolute Neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal 750/mm ( 3 ) 2 . Hemoglobingreater equal 10.0 g/dL woman Hemoglobin 11.0 g/dl men 3 . Platelet count great equal 75,000/mm ( 3 ) 4 . Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate ( eGFR ) &gt; 60 mL/min , eGFR calculate use Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration ( CKDEPI ) equation 5 .
