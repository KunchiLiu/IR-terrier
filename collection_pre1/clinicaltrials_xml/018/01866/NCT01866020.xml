	<detailed_description>Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis ( IPA ) difficult diagnose remains cause high morbidity mortality critically ill patient ICU . The number patient positive Aspergillus culture galactomannan test respiratory fluid increase every year . In 2007 Department test 21 patient positive Aspergillus , 2009 49 last year ( 2011 ) investigator find 59 patient positive 10 multidisciplinary ICUs . Accepted diagnostic protocol haemato-oncological patient applicable critically ill patient ICUs . Halo sign , typical radiological indication IPA , find haematological patient , patient ICU sign likely mask pneumonic infiltration due ventilator induce lung injury pneumonia . Microbiological diagnostics , like quantification galactomannan bronchoalveolar lavage specimen , change upon antibiotic treatment . It false positive patient treat beta-lactam antibiotic . Definitive discrimination aspergillic colonisation IPA often depend clinical experience treat physician , evaluate clinical sign , co-morbidities , course disease . Life save treatment first line antimycotic Voriconazol ( Vfend® ) initiate diagnosis IPA . In prospective clinical trial investigator aim structure , optimize fast track diagnostic pathway IPA critically ill patient treat ICU-department . After successful diagnosis , primary endpoint study 28-day mortality duration ICU stay . Secondary endpoint include difference antimycotic treatment , ventilation time type ventilation , co - morbidity treatment cost patient colonisation IPA group . Adult patient treat one ten multidisciplinary ICUs either positive respiratory fluid culture Aspergillus specie positive galactomannan test prospectively enrol . During 18 month enrollment period ( January 2013 July 2014 ) investigator plan screen critically ill patient enroll minimum 60 patient , represent expect number patient diagnose IPA propose time frame . In agreement standard operate procedure , study patient routinely subject follow examination , test receive diagnostic intervention , investigator assign specific intervention patient study . A bronchoalveolar lavage , perform senior pulmonologist , identify typical Aspergillus plaque obtain sufficient material microbiological analysis ( galactomannan test + polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) ) . Blood sample galactomannan test drawn additionally . The galactomannan test repeat weekly long infection symptom persist . Furthermore , patient subject high-resolution computer tomography thorax . Clinical diagnostic data patient collect centralized database subsequent analysis study .</detailed_description>
