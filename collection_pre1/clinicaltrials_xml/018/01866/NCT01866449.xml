	<brief_summary>The propose study open-label , single-arm , Phase- II trial ass efficacy cabazitaxel GBM WHO grade IV patient progression within 6 month last temozolomide treatment ( Figure 1 ) . Cabazitaxel give dose 25mg/m² 1h infusion every 3 week standard concomitant medication ( outline ) : - On Day 1 cycle , patient receive cabazitaxel dose 25mg/m² , administer i.v . route 1 hour . - Cycle length cabazitaxel 3 week ( 21 day ) . - New cycle therapy may begin Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) ≥1500/mm3 , platelet count ≥75 000/mm3 , non-hematological toxicity ( except alopecia ) recover baseline . - A maximum 2 week ( 14 day ) delay allow 2 treatment cycle . - Patients come treatment treatment delay 2 week . At least 30 minute prior administration cabazitaxel , patient receive i.v . premedication include : - An antihistamine ( dexchlorpheniramine 5mg , diphenhydramine 25mg , equivalent ) . In case i.v . antihistamine promethazine available , local practice follow . - Corticosteroid ( dexamethasone 8mg equivalent ) - H2 antagonist ( ranitidine equivalent ) . - Antiemetic prophylaxis recommend give orally intravenously necessary . - Primary prophylaxis Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor ( G-CSF ) give day 4 treatment cycle per ASCO ESMO guideline .</brief_summary>
