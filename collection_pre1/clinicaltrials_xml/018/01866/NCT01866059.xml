	<brief_summary>This study involve fill teeth decay root three different fill material . Patients attend Cork University Dental School hospital clinical examination complete questionnaire describe feel comfort appearance teeth . Patients ask provide sample saliva spit tube . This saliva test see level bacteria present well saliva neutralises acid diet . This used ass high low patient 's risk dental decay . They also complete questionnaire amount sugar diet often clean teeth . If exam show teeth decay fill , patient offer extraction teeth . All treatment discuss patient . Patients randomly assign one three material material use filling . Patients know three material receive three material already use dentistry element treatment plan well recognise , routine dental procedure . After treatment complete , patient show best take care teeth manage sugar intake reduce risk decay . Patients give appointment return review 6 month , 12 month , 18 month 24 month treatment . This include dental examination dental impression take . These used measure restorative material wear time . Patients also ask complete two questionnaire complete first visit see answer change .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Randomized Clinical Trial This study prospective study old adult . It assess suitability BiodentineTM fill material Class V lesion compare 's performance Glass ionomer cement ( GIC ) Resin-modified glass ionomer cement ( RMGIC ) . Patients study attend Cork University Dental School Hospital . These patient represent sample population elderly generally well able care independently well adhere give maintenance programme . The general method outline . Ethical Approval Ethical approval obtain Research Ethics Committee Cork Teaching Hospitals ( CREC ) recruitment , sample , treatment elderly patient . Written inform consent obtain participant . Inclusion Criteria For inclusion research patient : - Be either male female age 65 - Present minimum 6 teeth one arch - Have sufficient manual dexterity undertake tooth-brushing - Have sufficient cognitive ability understand consent procedure able complete questionnaire Exclusion Criteria Patients eligible inclusion : - They medically frail ( ASA III IV ) - They pulpal involvement painful symptomology sensitivity - They severe periodontal disease - They require antibiotic prophylaxis invasive dental treatment Patient Recruitment ( Phase 1 ) Prospective patient approach whilst attend Cork University Dental School Hospital . General medical dental practitioner Cork also give information regard study distribute patient may suitable . A number social club also approach . They receive information write include inclusion criterion well consent form . If indicate willingness participate , offer examination appointment . Insurance provide Clinical Indemnity Scheme , University College Cork . Clinical Examination Procedure The clinical examination procedure determine extent dental disease confirm suitability patient enrolment study . Clinical data collect suitably trained examiner . This examiner also provide restorative treatment patient study . During course initial examination follow data collect : - Age - Gender - Number teeth - Visually decay , miss fill teeth ( VDMFT ) index - Visually decay fill root surface ( RDFT ) - Plaque score - Bleeding score - Community Periodontal Index ( CPI ) - Salivary flow rate - Salivary buffer capacity ( use CRT®buffer kit ) - Strep mutans count ( use CRT®bacteria kit ) - Lactobacilli count ( use CRT®bacteria kit ) - Denture wearing ( Acrylic/Co-Cr , age denture , abutment teeth ) - Fluoride exposure ( public/private water supply , toothpaste , mouthwash ) - Medications ( xerostomic potential , sucrose contain ) - Frequency sugar intake - Dental attendance pattern - Alcohol consumption - Smoking history - Medical History - Radiographs ( clinically indicate ) The patient give another appointment return accept trial . Treatment Intervention ( Phase 2 ) Each patient randomly assign ( use random number allocation ) fill one three filling material ; Glass Ionomer Cement ( GIC ) , Resin Modified Glass Ionomer Cement ( RMGIC ) BiodentineTM . Treatment group randomize adjust covariates age , gender caries experience . Once determine fill material place lesion treatment intervention stage proceed follow ; 1 . Scaling/prophylaxis remove plaque calculus 2 . Removal carious tissue Class V lesion hand rotary instrument restoration result cavity randomly assign fill material They give review appointment 6 month , one year , 18 month two year . They send appointment card date next appointment post phone call confirm . Review Appointment ( Phase 3 ) At review appointment follow data gather ; 1 . Survival integrity restoration ( accord USPHS Criteria ) 2 . Wear rate restoration ( mean dental impression contact profilometry ) Blinding A suitably train examiner assess survival integrity restoration place principal investigator eliminate potential bias .</detailed_description>
