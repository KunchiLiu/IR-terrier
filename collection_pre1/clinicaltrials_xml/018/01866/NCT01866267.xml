	<brief_summary>This pilot single arm , single site , open-labeled switch study seek enroll thirty ( 30 ) HIV positive patient infect CCR5 tropic virus achieve undetectable viral load non-Selzentry®-containing regimen [ Protease Inhibitor ( PI ) /Non-Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor ( NNRTI ) /Integrase Inhibitor plus 2 Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitor ( NRTI ) ] switch once-daily Selzentry® ( 600mg qd ) plus 2 NRTIs .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective study determine regimen tolerability/toxicity maintain improved maintaining virologic suppression follow switch once-daily Selzentry® . The study duration 48 week . Patients must HIV-1 RNA &lt; 100 copies/mL ≥3 month first HIV treatment regimen . Prior regimen modification reason virologic failure acceptable previously achieve virologic suppression maintain . A Trofile® DNA use document exclusive CCR5 tropism . Patients history dual/mixed CXCR4-tropic HIV-1 exclude participation . Patients prior exposure Selzentry® also exclude . Patients qualify participation discontinue PI , NNRTI , Integrase inhibitor portion regimen begin Selzentry® 600mg QD . Patients continue two ( 2 ) NRTIs previous treatment regimen . The primary endpoint : percentage HIV positive patient undetectable viral load ( HIV-1 RNA &lt; 100 copies/mL ) Week 24 . Secondary endpoint : safety tolerability once-daily Selzentry® Weeks 24 48 ( measure clinical laboratory adverse event regimen satisfaction questionnaire ) , percentage HIV positive patient undetectable viral load ( HIV-1 RNA &lt; 100 copies/mL ) Week 48 , change baseline CD4+ T-cell count Weeks 24 48 , change baseline inflammatory marker ( C-reactive protein ) Weeks 24 48 , assessment resistance-associated mutation viral tropism change baseline , , emerge virologic failure .</detailed_description>
