	<detailed_description>Objectives Among smoker wish quit time plan quit next month : Major Hypotheses Major Hypothesis 1 : A treatment reduce cigs/day include nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) increase incidence quit attempt ( yes/no outcome ) . Major Hypothesis 2 : A motivational treatment base USPHS 's 5 Rs increase incidence quit attempt ( yes/no outcome ) A comparison two active condition objective study . The current application focus new clinical intervention increase quit attempt . One recent method increase quit attempt ambivalent smoker reduction cigs/day . This method typically include teach way reduce cigs/day aid nicotine replacement therapy ( NRT ) . Recent review meta-analyses conclude reduction aid NRT among ambivalent smoker consistently increase probability future quit attempt abstinence . Another recent clinical method prompt quit attempt motivational treatment . The USPHS treatment guideline recommend smoker ready quit receive briefer , somewhat different motivational treatment focus `` 5 Rs ; '' i.e. , ) personal relevance smoking , b ) risk smoke , ) reward smoke cessation , ) roadblocks quit e ) repetition . Rationale Proposed Studies : We propose test efficacy non-pharmacological reduction treatment two reason . First , many smoker willing use NRT reduction . Another reason test non-pharmacological treatment reduction prior study NRT- aid reduction interpret indicate reduce cigs/day increase later quit ; however , since many ( ) recent study suggest pretreatment NRT alone improve quit , unclear whether reduction pretreatment cause increase quit prior study . We also propose replication test 5 Rs intervention , although counseling technique review Relevance , Risks , Rewards , Roadblocks , Repeat ( 5R 's ) part last two USPHS Guidelines ( recently update 2008 ) , search PubMed , PsychINFO , NIH RePorter ( database NIH grant ) clinicaltrials.gov 11/11 indicates publish current plan test 5 Rs , study ( Carpenter et al. , 2004 ) . Clearly , one test approach recommend &gt; 80 % smoker ready quit ( Wewers , Stillman , Hartman , &amp; Shopland , 2003 ) need . Another reason replication test prior Journal Consulting Clinical Psychology ( JCCP ) study 5 Rs use treatment control group ; thus , wish increase clinical relevance methodological rigor employ usual care comparison condition . Study Design Design Rationale Methodological Decisions : We use three-group ( n= 560 total ) Randomized Control Trial ( RCT ) test whether reduction 5 Rs motivational intervention increase incidence quit attempt ( Table 2 ) . The reduction 5 Rs intervention time-matched initial 15 min call baseline follow two 10 min call 2 4 week later ( total = 35 min ) . The usual care condition receive brief ( &lt; 5 min ) call mail information risk smoking , self-quitting treatment resource time-points . Monitoring cigs/day abstinence via weekly online questionnaire . Timing treatment measure Counseling call Usual care : baseline Reduction : baseline , Week 2 , Week 4 5Rs : baseline , Week 2 , Week 4 Measures 3 group -- ask weekly x 4 monthly x 5 cigs/day quit attempt abstinence mediator Subject Selection Subjects current smoker plan quit near future ; i.e. , 70 % smoker , purpose treatment prompt new quit attempt among ambivalent smoker . Vulnerable Populations Not applicable Number Subjects 560 current smoker . We consent 560 effort 516 complete least one counselor call .</detailed_description>
