	<brief_summary>This research last decade focus kinetics systemic local immune response parenteral influenza vaccine human . The investigator show normally high number influenza specific antibody secrete cell ( ASC ) present nasal mucosa healthy adult upon parenteral vaccination number remain stable . However , rapid transient increase specific ASC observe tonsils peripheral blood parenteral vaccination . In tonsil , associate significant decrease naïve/effector ( CD45RA+ ) memory ( CD45RO+ ) CD4+ cell upon vaccination . In study investigator extend work investigate characteristic influenza-specific T- B-cells induce locally systemically intranasal vaccination man .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The clinical trial open study . All subject eligible tonsillectomy Haukeland University Hospital within specify age range ( child : 2 less 18 year old adult &gt; 18-59 year old ) receive invitation join study . The primary endpoint trial evaluation systemic local immune response live attenuate influenza vaccine . The vaccine specific immune response assess induction specific local systemic antibody cellular immune response , analyse epitope response direct . Furthermore capacity vaccine elicit cross reactive long lasting immunity evaluate .</detailed_description>
