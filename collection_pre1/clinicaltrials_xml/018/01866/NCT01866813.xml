	<brief_title>Internet-Delivered Cognitive Training For Breast Cancer Survivors With Cognitive Complaints</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Studies within last decade indicate many cancer patient survivor experience cognitive deficit impaired memory concentration diagnosis treatment . The cognitive deficit see complication cancer treatment generally attribute chemotherapy , hence term `` chemo brain '' . However , recent research indicate chemotherapy probably cause cognitive deficit several cancer patient ( 23-33 % ) impair cognitive function even therapy initiate , finding suggest former cancer patient low level cognitive function regardless treatment status . The cognitive profile cancer patient indicate involvement frontal-subcortical dysfunction affect process speed , attention , work memory , learn recall , executive function . Cancer patient often report cognitive capacity daily life deteriorate . In qualitative interview , woman breast cancer describe experience memory problem work , whilst woman sick leave worry cognitive impairment issue return work . Among former breast cancer patient , report perceived cognitive limitation associate reduced work capacity . Cognitive rehabilitation former cancer patient important concern , since even mild cognitive dysfunction may significant impact return welfare work aspect everyday living . Although several cancer patient express interest intervention aim alleviate perceive cognitive deficit , two study far assessed effect cognitive intervention former cancer patient . Ferguson colleague devise cognitive training program focus relaxation technique compensatory strategy order improve everyday skill . The program consist four individual consultation total three phone consultation . The program test non-randomized design 29 breast cancer patient complete chemotherapy least 3 year earlier . They find improvement test attention , memory executive function , participant experience improvement daily cognitive functioning . In randomized controlled design , Poppelreuter colleague test two intervention improve attention memory group breast cancer patient . Both intervention consist four one-hour session per week . On average , 11.5 session per patient . The two intervention include group max 8 participant lead occupational therapist memory attention train relation activity daily live ( n = 33 ) group undergo individual computer-based training attention memory therapeutic supervision subsequent coaching ( n = 34 ) . The study find general improvement neuropsychological test score self-reported reduction cognitive impairment intervention group control group . Due limit result far , remain unclear extent intervention effect cognitive deficit experience cancer patient benefit cognitive intervention . Recent research show specific computerized brain training program improve cognitive function work memory individual congenital contract cognitive impairment measurable increase brain activity . Given widespread experience impair cognitive function among former cancer patient negative consequence problem could work capacity quality life , highly relevant examine whether similar computerized training program help former cancer patient . As likely cost-effective method relation time , effort cost , perspective relation implementation dissemination promising . OBJECTIVES The aim study investigate whether woman treat breast cancer experience cognitive difficulty profit Internet-based program Scientific Brain Training Pro respect : 1 ) attention , work memory , learn recall , executive function assess standardized neuropsychological test 2 , ) self-reported cognitive difficulty daily life measure questionnaire .</detailed_description>
