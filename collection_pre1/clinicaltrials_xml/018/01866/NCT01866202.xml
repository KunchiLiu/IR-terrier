	<brief_summary>Aims : To evaluate role monoclonal antibody detection cancer specific antigens blood tumor tissue , potential use antibody future evaluation therapy . Also , evaluate presence circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) study EMT ( epithelial-mesenchymal ) signature change chemotherapy . Methods : To take 20mls blood advance breast cancer patient new course anti-cancer therapy , another 20mls blood 3 week treatment . In addition , Consent obtain cut 10-15 tissue section archival tumor specimen . Whenever possible , blood taking time additional needle prick do specifically purpose study , coincide standard blood taking required patient 's treatment . Importance propose research science medicine : Detection tumor specific antigen blood may potentially reduce need invasive biopsy confirmation diagnosis cancer follow-up cancer future . The identification development antibody specific tumor antigens marker may offer future therapeutic option , vehicle deliver cytotoxic therapy . Identification CTCs well understanding change occur EMT signature circulate tumor cell may serve mean potential mean prognostication modification therapy future . Potential Benefits Risks : Potential risk patient include blood taking ( pain , feel faint , infection ) . Patients benefit directly study knowledge gain may help management future patient . Cancer biomarkers , antigen circulate tumor cell , may potential area develop new method diagnosis treatment cancer . Monoclonal antibiotic able identify isolated may specifically target progenitor breast cancer well CTCs . The change occur CTCs treatment may serve mean prognostication , well allow therapeutic modification . Clinical correlative study area ( MAbs CTCs ) serve determine role clinical application future .</brief_summary>
