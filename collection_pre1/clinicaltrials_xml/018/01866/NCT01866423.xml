	<brief_title>Orteronel Treating Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess relationship circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) -based androgen receptor ( AR ) expression level &gt; =-50 % prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) decline follow 12 week therapy TAK-700 ( orteronel ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess change PSA CTC level time PSA progression ( best response , decline 12 week continuous variable , etc . ) without prior docetaxel-based treatment . II . To assess measurable disease response time radiographic disease progression castration-resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) without prior docetaxel-based treatment . III . To explore relationship endocrine clinical response . IV . To confirm safety TAK-700 administer without prednisone patient metastatic CRPC . OUTLINE : Patients receive orteronel orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
