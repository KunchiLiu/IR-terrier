	<detailed_description>Background : Burn injury require mechanical ventilation affect high proportion 25,000 patient admit US Burn Centers every year . Patients burn injury acute respiratory failure ( ARF ) experience deconditioning , muscle weakness , joint contracture , dyspnea , depression , reduce health-related quality life . Delivery rehabilitative therapy ( physical therapy ) within Burn Intensive Care Unit ( BICU ) burn patient require mechanical ventilation uniform content , timing , acceptance safety . Our publish data indicate Standardized Rehabilitation Therapy , initiate ICU , feasible safe Medical ICU patient . Data show reduction hospital stay , improvement functional outcome . Mechanistically , understood patient burn concomitant ARF exhibit acute alteration metabolism , resultant loss muscle strength . This study demonstrate Standardized Rehabilitation Therapy burn patient ARF reduce hospital stay immediate improvement functional capacity functional performance . Our team comprise Burn Surgeons , Intensivists expertise Critical Care Trial design , Exercise Physiologists Outpatient Functional Outcome Assessment Experts . The design conceive US-Critical Illness Injury Trials Group allow investigator bring varied expertise problem face critically ill Burn patient . Objective/Hypotheses : 1 ) Standardized Rehabilitation Therapy ( SRT ) shorten hospital stay burn patient ARF . 2 ) SRT prevent loss muscle size loss architecture critical illness severe burn . 3 ) SRT improve objective functional measure quality life 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 month post-enrollment . Specific Aims : Aim 1 : To determine whether standardized rehabilitation therapy BICU patient require mechanical ventilation decrease hospital length stay . Aim 2 : To determine serial ultrasound strength assessment whether standardized rehabilitation therapy decrease loss biceps quadriceps size , architecture strength critical illness severe burn patient . Aim 3 : To determine whether standardized rehabilitation therapy improve functional capacity performance , quality life . Study Design : The investigator conduct two arm trial stratify randomization 150 burn patient concomitant ARF compare SRT , initiate mechanical ventilation ICU administer throughout hospitalization , vs. Usual Care ( control ) . Standardized Rehabilitation Therapy consist : passive range motion , physical therapy , progressive resistance exercise ( strength training ) . Our unique approach provide experience Mobility Team ( 7days/week ) consist critical care nurse , physical therapist , nursing assistant administer protocol 3 University Hospital site . The propose study natural extension prior work , multidisciplinary , support extensive preliminary study , innovative application strength train technique in-hospital strength assessment . Relevance : Burn patient ARF suffer month hospital discharge weakness decrease quality life . This study provide information prioritize budget rehabilitation need burn patient ARF demonstrate Standardized Rehabilitation Therapy , initiate ICU , reduce hospital length stay immediate sustain improvement function quality life burn patient ARF . Given military burn patient civilian burn patient utilize similar resource experience similar outcome , result study immediately transferable military burn patient concomitant ARF result improve outcome .</detailed_description>
