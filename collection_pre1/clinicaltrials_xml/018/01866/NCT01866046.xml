	<detailed_description>A . Specific Aims More one million Americans live HIV , 20 % unaware HIV status . Early detection HIV status crucial prevent transmission others link HIV positive medical care clinical service . Consistently , National HIV/AIDS strategy establish goal increase awareness HIV status Americans 79 % 90 % within next four year . Thus , strong need increase test effort , particularly among high risk , underserved population . To effective , test effort need address many barrier test linkage care face underserved population . Victims intimate partner violence ( IPV ) one underserved population high risk HIV infection face many barrier test linkage care . IPV pervasive public health problem 25 % woman report IPV lifetime . A grow body literature highlight association IPV HIV risk . IPV victim likely engage HIV risk behavior , include unprotected sex , sex risky partner ( e.g. , HIV-positive , injection drug user ) , sex one sex partner , trade sex , likely sexually transmit disease ( STI ) . Additionally , posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) substance use disorder ( SUD ) , highly prevalent IPV victim , associate high risk sexual behavior . Furthermore , woman IPV underutilize medical care often encounter numerous barrier health care ( e.g. , transportation , un-insured ) . Unfortunately , HIV prevention intervention develop test vulnerable underserved population woman . IPV Victims domestic shelter significant risk HIV ( i.e. , 69-87 % report unprotected sex 33 % report STI ) . Domestic violence shelter also present opportune set provide health care service woman . There approximately 2,000 community-based shelter program throughout US , provide emergency shelter approximately 300,000 woman child year . Considering number woman seek help facility IPV victim seek shelter already institute change life , prime time intervene may woman already seek help community base organization . Further , domestic shelter provide safe supportive environment ideal HIV test prevention . Thus incorporate HIV test prevention within domestic shelter provide access significant population woman overall high risk HIV infection significantly reduce many barrier test linkage care face IPV victim . Rapid HIV test allows provision HIV testing , counseling , test result one visit , eliminate problem client return test result . Thus , rapid test offer ideal option resident domestic shelter , give multiple compete demand barrier traditional HIV test prevention . RESPECT evidence-based CDC Diffusion Effective Behavioral Interventions ( DEBI ) , utilize client-focused , interactive HIV risk reduction counsel model deliver conjunction HIV test . RESPECT-2 , adapt use rapid testing , brief easily adaptable many clinical setting . IPV victim , however , face distinct HIV risk factor , difficulty negotiate condom use preventative sexual behavior , fear retaliation rap abusive partner . Hence , RESPECT-2 need tailored meet specific need target population . The Specific Aims R21 Exploratory/Developmental Research Proposal ( ) expand RESPECT-2 target population ( i.e. , RESPECT-IPV ) ( b ) collect preliminary data RESPECT-IPV + rapid test 's feasibility , acceptability , initial efficacy resident domestic shelter . To facilitate sustainability future dissemination RESPECT-IPV + rapid testing , intervention deliver trained personnel community-based CDC support counseling , test , referral ( CTC ) sit . The development aim R21 proposal develop manual RESPECT-IPV , incorporate information gather four focus group IPV victim two focus group shelter staff , literature IPV HIV risk , pre-pilot open trial increase acceptability RESPECT-IPV tailor intervention meet unique need target population . The pilot study aim R21 proposal : ( 1 ) Assess feasibility acceptability RESPECT-IPV + rapid test sample 100 high-risk shelter woman . Predictors acceptability ( e.g. , PTSD symptom , substance use , IPV severity , prior test history , HIV knowledge , HIV risk behavior , HIV anxiety , stage change ) also explore . ( 2 ) Conduct open trial RESPECT-IPV + rapid test sample 100 high-risk shelter woman examine preliminary evidence hypothesis RESPECT-IPV associate reduce unprotected vaginal anal sex occasion ( USOs ) 1-week 3-months leave shelter few case vaginal trichomoniasis 3-months leave shelter . Secondary outcome include HIV knowledge , risk intention , HIV risk behavior ( e.g . multiple partner , substance use ) . As result create novel test counsel intervention high-risk , underserved , shelter woman , provide groundwork test RESPECT-IPV 's efficacy future R01 clinical trial dissemination study .</detailed_description>
