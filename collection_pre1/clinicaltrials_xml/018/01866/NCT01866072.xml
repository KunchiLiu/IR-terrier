	<brief_summary>Transient elastography novel non-invasive method assessment hepatic fibrosis patient chronic liver disease , measure liver stiffness . Transient elastography user friendly technique easily perform bedside outpatient clinic immediate result good reproducibility . Liver stiffness value range 2.5 75 kPa low value &lt; 6kPa suggest fibrosis high value 14kPa suggests cirrhosis . In present study investigator hypothesis investigator differentiate ACLF acute severe viral hepatitis base fibroscan patient underlie fibrosis superadded inflammation would higher fibroscan value patient inflammation underlie fibrosis hence investigator avoid unnecessary test subgroup .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Role Transient Elastography ( Fibroscan ) Differentiating Patients Acute Severe Viral Hepatitis Acute Chronic Liver Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Transient elastography novel non-invasive method assessment hepatic fibrosis patient chronic liver disease , measure liver stiffness . Acute chronic liver failure : acute hepatic insult manifest jaundice coagulopathy , complicate within 4 week ascites and/or encephalopathy patient previously diagnose undiagnosed chronic liver disease . Acute severe hepatitis : Acute severe hepatitis characterize serum bilirubin &gt; = 10.0 mg/dL international normalize ratio ( INR ) &gt; = 1.5 . Patients acute severe viral hepatitis acute chronic liver failure enrol prospective study take informed write consent . All patient evaluate baseline per standard protocol include evaluation etiology disease test exclude underlie liver disease include ultrasound/computed tomography necessary upper gastrointestinal endoscopy liver biopsy imaging show sign underlie liver disease . patient follow 1 month , patient undergo Fibroscan time admission thereafter 1week 4th week .</detailed_description>
