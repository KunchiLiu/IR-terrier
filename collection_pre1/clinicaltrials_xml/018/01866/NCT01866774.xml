	<brief_summary>Triaging new pediatric gastroenterology consultation challenge inflammatory non-inflammatory gastrointestinal ( GI ) diseases present non-specific chronic abdominal pain and/or diarrhea . Examples inflammatory GI disease include Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis celiac disease non-inflammatory GI disease lactose intolerance , irritable bowel syndrome non-ulcer dyspepsia . Inflammatory GI diseases require different investigation treatment non-inflammatory GI diseases ideally , would identify early . Higher priority triage patient would allow timely organization investigation include pertinent laboratory testing , radiologic study gastrointestinal endoscopy . These invasive procedure need patient present non-specific gastrointestinal symptom . Therefore , investigator routinely ask screen laboratory test study child refer clinic . Non-invasive screening test GI disorder may aid appropriately triaging new consultation pediatric gastroenterology . Calprotectin protein find inflammatory cell call neutrophil . The concentration calprotectin stool reflect presence inflammatory process occur GI tract . Thus , test calprotectin propose potentially useful test detect inflammatory GI disease , notably Crohn 's disease ulcerative colitis . Alternatively , simple gastrointestinal questionnaire `` red flag '' symptom family history GI disorder may also benefit . The investigator hypothesize use fecal calprotectin screen GI questionnaire aid identify child high risk inflammatory GI disorder . Subsequently , high priority triaging patient decrease time diagnosis inflammatory GI disease . This single centre , stratify , randomize clinical trial conduct Kingston , Ontario , Canada . Patients refer pediatric gastroenterology service without know diagnosis non-specific chronic abdominal pain and/or diarrhea ask participate study . All patient meet inclusion criterion consent telephone standard form . Consenting patient mail GI questionnaire fecal calprotectin test kit . The fecal calprotectin test kid include instruction , stool collection kit return postage . All patient give next available appointment pediatric gastroenterologist . Patients randomize receive either usual care ( 50 % , 40 patient ) screen fecal calprotectin ( FC ) measurement ( 50 % , 40 patient ) . Patients FC group FC measure Quantum Blue® Rapid Calprotectin Assay . If calprotectin level high ( 50 μg/g ) , patient contact telephone give new appointment time ( within 14 work day ) . This study may positive impact demonstrate novel method decrease time diagnosis inflammatory GI disease .</brief_summary>
