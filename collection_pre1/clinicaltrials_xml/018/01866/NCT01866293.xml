	<criteria>MSKCC confirm diagnosis multiple myeloma relapse resistant therapy least one immunomodulatory drug ( i.e . lenalidomide , thalidomide ) least one proteasome inhibitor . Age ≥ 18 year old . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 02 . The subject organ marrow function follow : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500/mm3 ( GCSF allow ) . Platelets ≥ 50,000/mm3 30,000 ( marrow infiltrate myeloma ; platelet transfusion allow 7 day prior screen ) Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL ( transfusion ) . Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) . Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN calculate creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤ 3 × ULN liver involvement , ≤ 5 × ULN liver involvement . Lipase &lt; 1.5 x upper limit normal . Patient must able/willing undergo bone marrow aspirate biopsy . Subjects brain metastasis CNS disease consider eligible subject receive radiation therapy brain metastasis within 2 week enrollment stable dose steroid 2 week . Sexually active subject ( men woman ) must agree use medically accept barrier method contraception ( e.g . male condom , female condom , diaphragm spermicidal gel ) course study 4 month last dose study drug ( ) , even oral contraceptive also use . All subject reproductive potential must agree use barrier method second method birth control . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test screening . Women childbearing potential include woman experience menarche undergone successful surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal . Postmenopause define : Amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive month without another cause OR A documented serum folliclestimulating hormone ( FSH ) level &gt; 35 mIU/mL ( woman irregular menstrual period hormone replacement therapy ) The subject receive cytotoxic chemotherapy ( include investigational cytotoxic chemotherapy ) biologic agent ( e.g. , cytokine antibody ) within 2 week , nitrosoureas/ mitomycin C within 6 week first dose study treatment . The subject receive radiation therapy within 14 day first dose study treatment . The subject receive prior treatment small molecule kinase inhibitor hormonal therapy ( include investigational kinase inhibitor hormone ) within 14 day five halflives compound active metabolite , whichever longer , first dose study treatment . The subject recover toxicity due prior therapy ( i.e. , return pretherapy baseline Grade 0 1 ) . The subject prothrombin time ( PT ) / International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) test result screen ≥1.3 ×ULN . The subject uncontrolled significant intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , uncontrolled congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris within 6 month , stroke within 6 month , myocardial infarction within 6 month , uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia , uncontrolled hypertension . Corrected QTc great 500msec . The subject pregnant breastfeeding . The subject previously identify allergy hypersensitivity component study treatment formulation . The subject require concomitant treatment , therapeutic dos , anticoagulant warfarin warfarinrelated agent , heparin , thrombin Factor Xa inhibitor , antiplatelet agent ( e.g. , clopidogrel ) . Low dose aspirin ( ≤ 81 mg/day ) , lowdose warfarin ( ≤ 1 mg/day ) , prophylactic low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) permit . The subject experience follow within 6 month first dose study treatment : 1. clinicallysignificant hematemesis gastrointestinal bleeding 2. hemoptysis ≥ 0.5 teaspoon ( 2.5ml ) red blood 3. sign indicative pulmonary hemorrhage The subject radiographic evidence cavitating pulmonary lesion ( ) The subject tumor contact , invade encase major blood vessel Gastrointestinal disorder particularly associate high risk perforation fistula formation include : Any following time screen ) intraabdominal tumor/metastases invade GI mucosa ii ) active peptic ulcer disease , iii ) inflammatory bowel disease ( include ulcerative colitis Crohn 's disease ) , diverticulitis , cholecystitis , symptomatic cholangitis appendicitis iv ) malabsorption syndrome Any follow within 6 month first dose study treatment : ) history abdominal fistula ii ) gastrointestinal perforation iii ) bowel obstruction gastric outlet obstruction iv ) intraabdominal abscess . Note : Complete resolution intraabdominal abscess must confirm prior initiating treatment cabozantinib even abscess occur 6 month ago . History major surgery follow : 1 . Major surgery within 3 month first dose cabozantinib . Major surgery within 6 month first dose cabozantinib complication relate wound heal . 2 . Minor surgery within 1 month first dose cabozantinib wound heal complication within 3 month first dose cabozantinib wound complication ( particularly associate delayed incomplete healing ) within 28 day . Note : Complete heal follow abdominal surgery must confirm prior initiating treatment cabozantinib even surgery occur 28 day ago . Other disorder associate high risk fistula formation include PEG tube placement within 3 month first dose study therapy concurrent evidence intraluminal tumor involve trachea esophagus . Concurrent malignancy except treated nonmelanoma skin cancer cervical carcinoma situ . The subject require chronic concomitant treatment strong CYP3A4 inducer ( e.g. , dexamethasone , phenytoin , carbamazepine , rifampin , rifabutin , rifapentine , phenobarbital , St. John 's Wort ) .</criteria>
