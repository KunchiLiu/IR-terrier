	<brief_summary>To practice independently surgeon require competency surgical skill , encompass combination technical non-technical skill . Cognitive skill , aspects non-technical skill , represent integral component surgical competency . Cognitive skill comprise factual knowledge decision-making . Changing work pattern United Kingdom , specify European Working Time Directive ( EWTD ) , profound impact delivery surgical skill train . Surgical trainee increasingly remove normal working hour majority traditional operative training experience gain , leading net reduction trainee ' operative exposure . This reduction operative experience mean surgical competence longer assured basis experience alone . Although educational technology replace craft apprenticeship require train competent surgeon , reduction training hour lead rapid development educational tool augment surgical skill train outside operating room environment . These tool tend concentrate technical skill performance without emphasis cognitive skill . Trainees today 's era grow multimedia environment ; multimedia medium use combination text , voiceover , animation video . Multimedia underdevelop educational resource supplement cognitive skill train operative surgery . The purpose study design develop online multimedia educational tool common colorectal surgery procedure ( `` Anterior Resection '' ) determine effectiveness tool teach assessment cognitive skill . Study hypothesis : Multimedia learn equivalent conventional teach `` Study Day '' improve score cognitive surgical skill .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study involve two main objective : 1 . Develop design multimedia educational tool open laparoscopic anterior resection - The multimedia tool develop collaboration professional multimedia company ( Digimed ) . Initially 31 open 35 laparoscopic ( key-hole ) procedure film informed , write consent obtain patient . Key procedural steps/ subtasks identify integrated onto navigational interactive interface platform develop use Adobe® Flash® Professional CS5 10.1 . - Each subtask composited succinct video clip use Final Cut Pro® , supplement annotation , animation , text voiceover . Content address cognitive aspect include factual anatomical knowledge , decision-making point , instrumentation require , team positioning use assistance . The multimedia educational tool available online follow link http : //www.colorectaltraining.co.uk . The colorectal training website 1.24GB include 69 video clip open tool 67 video clip laparoscopic tool . 2 . Evaluate effectiveness multimedia teaching/assessment cognitive surgical skill - A randomised control study conduct evaluate effectiveness online multimedia comparison conventional `` Study day '' teach cognitive surgical skill acquisition . Enrolled participant randomly allocate either intervention ( Multimedia ) control ( Study Day ) Group . The methodology assessment online time ( write ) assessment test cognitive surgical skill . All trainee assess study period . - Following ethic approval , permission obtain surgical training programme director ( TPDs ) recruit trainee study . The study conduct 6th October 2011 23rd December 2011 . Trainees invite participate contact email . A study flyer attachment hyperlink ( http : //www.colorectaltraining.co.uk ) provide trainees access relevant study information 'Participation Information Sheet ' online consent form . After submission consent form , trainee direct separate web page secure web-based service contain Trainee Proforma ( obtain demographic participant information ) Pre-Assessment Test . - Participants multimedia group provide unrestricted access 30 day study day hold end period `` Study Day '' group . Multimedia group participant email individual login password access multimedia tool colorectal train website : http : //www.colorectaltraining.co.uk . The login detail request time website access . - The study day involve series detail interactive lecture cover step open laparoscopic anterior resection surgery . The content deliver identical multimedia tool . After period one week , study participant require complete online Post-Assessment test . Multimedia group participant email separate hyperlink complete online Evaluation form . All complete form store securely analysis . 3 . Sample size - Sample size calculated basis pilot study 50 surgical trainee take part anterior resection study day January 2009 . Trainees ask complete pre-study day write assessment , follow post-study day assessment immediately lecture complete . The mean ( SD ) pre- post-assessments score 12.4 ( 4.56 ) 26.8 ( 3.99 ) respectively . - The sample size calculate mean change assumption baseline ( pre-assessment ) score arm . Mean change score control 14.4 ( 4.9 ) expect mean change score 24.4 ( SD 4.9 ) intervention group assume . The sample size require test hypothesis type I error 5 % power 80 % calculate ( per group ) 10 . So total 20 trainee need recruit . If response rate 20 % assume drop rate 20 % ( ( 20/20 % ) / ( 1-20 % ) ) , total 125 trainee need approach . 4 . Statistical analysis - The baseline pre-assessment test ensure comparability knowledge base cognitive skill study group help assess construct validity assessment tool . Basic descriptive statistic include number percentage categorical data , mean standard deviation normally distribute continuous data ; median range skew data also include . All data analyse intention treat basis . - Differences assessment score multimedia control ( study day ) group compare use either unpaired Students ' t-test ( normally distribute data ) Mann Whitney U test ( skew data ) . To analyse post-scores versus pre-test score within group , pair t-test ( normally distribute data ) Mann Whitney U test ( skew data ) use . Data analyse use SPSS ( statistical package social science version 16.0 , Chicago IL ) . Significance level set P &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
