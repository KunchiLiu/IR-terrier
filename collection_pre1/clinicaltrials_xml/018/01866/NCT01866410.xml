	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well cabozantinib-s-malate erlotinib hydrochloride work treat patient previously treat metastatic non-small cell lung cancer . Cabozantinib-s-malate erlotinib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Cabozantinib-s-malate may also stop growth non-small cell lung cancer block blood flow tumor . Giving cabozantinib-s-malate together erlotinib hydrochloride may effective treatment non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cabozantinib-S-Malate Erlotinib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Previously Treated Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate efficacy response rate ( RR ) patient advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) harbor epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutation progress follow EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) therapy treat XL184 ( cabozantinib [ cabozantinib-s-malate ] ) erlotinib ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine progression free survival ( PFS ) combination XL184 ( cabozantinib ) erlotinib EGFR mutation positive patient follow progression erlotinib . II . Assess overall survival . III . Evaluate change tumor growth rate XL184 ( cabozantinib ) erlotinib . IV . Evaluate type , severity , duration outcome toxicity . V. Correlate outcome tumor biomarkers meet proto-oncogene ( MET ) amplification , T790M mutation , serum marker vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) MET pathways preliminary manner . OUTLINE : Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally ( PO ) daily erlotinib hydrochloride PO daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 12 week 1 year annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
