	<brief_title>Follow-Up Study Validating Blended Technique</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In 2012 , investigator Vidacare evaluate 4 technique commonly use identify proximal humerus IO insertion site determine one technique result consistent successful placement IO needle set high level confidence among device operator perform technique . Results suggest combination best feature 4 technique may lead optimal IO needle set placement consistently . This study need validate `` Blended '' proximal humerus IO insertion technique confirm use technique result proper site identification among device operator result increase confidence.To closely evaluate Blended proximal humerus insertion technique receive clinician perform procedure actual patient , device operator include licensed/certified clinician include , emergency medicine technicians/paramedics nurse .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Currently licensed/certified Emergency Medicine Technicians , paramedic , nurse Have formal training use proximal humerus IO insertion site Demonstrate proper use device technique train portion obtain approval device trainer participate Previous train establish proximal humerus intraosseous vascular access</criteria>
