	<detailed_description>Study Rationale The use bi-frontal , near infrared spectrophotometry ( NIRS ) base cerebral oximetry monitoring demonstrate result improved clinical outcome general surgery patient cardiac surgical patient use prospective , randomize control trial methodology . Elderly thoracic surgical patient undergoing procedure involve single lung ventilation may also stand benefit application intraoperative early postoperative NIRS cerebral oximetry monitoring . Cerebral oximetry establish standard care monitor modality patient population , thus permit application randomize , control test methodology assess potential impact monitoring modality upon patient . Hypothesis Objectives : The primary hypothesis pilot study elderly thoracic surgical patient undergoing procedure involve single lung ventilation ( SLV ) measurable significant clinical benefit ( assess broad range postoperative clinical outcome measure ) subject randomize intervention cohort ( open bi-frontal NIRS base cerebral oximetry monitor standardize intervention protocol ) vs. control cohort ( blind bi-frontal NIRS base cerebral oximetry monitoring ) . The primary objective pilot study identify relevant clinical outcome variable significantly diverge result randomize intervention cohort vs. control cohort large , multicenter , prospective , randomize control clinical trial design test primary hypothesis state preceding section . The subsequent large , multicenter trial conduct definitively demonstrate ability INVOS® 5100 guide NIRS-based bi-frontal monitoring improve clinical outcome surgical patient group potentially establish new U.S. Food Drug Administration clear indication monitoring modality . The clinical outcome variable assess primary objective many detailed list variable find OUTCOME MEASURES - Primary Outcome Measure Section submission . Secondary objective pilot study include follow : 1 . Assess frequency cerebral desaturations intervention control cohorts examine total number patient experience cerebral desaturation well total number event among patient experience cerebral desaturation ( least 5 % baseline progressively large desaturations ) . These analysis conduct entire study population well upon cohort . The Area Under Curve ( AUC ) analysis technique [ incremental desaturation category assess base upon 5 50 % decrease , measure 5 % increment , establish room air pre-incision baseline well oxygen supplement pre-incision baseline well desaturations absolute measure rSO2 value ] employ conduct analysis . 2 . Assess frequency adverse clinical event serious adverse event overall cohort . 3 . Perform comprehensive assessment frequency efficacy predefined rSO2 desaturation mitigation intervention collective ability affect observe cerebral oximetry value . 4 . Assess interventional cohort 's preoperative demographic collect covariates association ease difficulty mitigate observed cerebral desaturation event . Exploratory analysis include perform possible comparison two group base upon collect perioperative variable examine potentially significant relationship collect clinical variable represent surrogate organ perfusion/function cerebral oximetry desaturations ( AUCrSO2 ) . The following exploratory endpoint assess : 1 . Logistic regression analysis determine relevant AUCrSO2 desaturation value ( ) associate detrimental clinical outcome ( ) monitor study 2 . Logistic regression analysis determine relevant AUC blood pressure value associate detrimental clinical outcome ( ) monitor study 3 . Comparison baseline rSO2 value ( room air oxygen supplement ) collect clinical variable ass possibly significant association 4 . Explore potential impact rSO2 monitor change surgical conduct procedure Methodology : Single center , prospective , randomize , control clinical pilot study Number Subjects : 100 subject balance randomization ( 1:1 ) control ( blind NIRS data ) intervention ( open NIRS data ) cohorts Main Criteria Inclusion : Elderly patient ( &gt; 65 year age ) schedule thoracic surgical procedure UHCMC involve SLV . Duration Treatment : Cerebral oximetry monitor begin assessment room air oxygen supplement bi-frontal baseline NIRS value continue surgery either PACU discharge initial 12 hour post surgical ICU treatment . Mini Mental Status exam test Delirium test Confusion Assessment Method occur preoperatively postoperatively post-operative day ( POD ) # 3 ( discharge occur sooner POD # 3 ) . Enrolled subject follow index hospitalization undergo 30 day follow telephone interview ass progress follow hospital discharge . Criteria Evaluation : A large number intraoperative postoperative clinical variable include cerebral oximetry , pulse oximetry , blood pressure , composite outcome measure clinical variable represent organ function assess primary endpoint determination clinical variable improve , , result randomize open NIRS data monitoring predefined desaturation intervention algorithm guideline . The Mini Mental Status exam Confusion Assessment Method test use determine measure clinical variable effect upon neuropsychological outcome . The frequency effectiveness various cerebral desaturation mitigate intervention assess intervention cohort . Additional Safety Observations : The frequency severity adverse clinical event serious adverse clinical event assess determine use open NIRS data bi-frontal cerebral monitoring associate significant change observation event . Statistical Methods : Preoperative demographic clinical variable compare two group assess significant difference use independent t-test . Differences observe clinical data group determine Wilcoxon rank-sum test . Stepwise , forward , multivariable logistic regression analysis perform assess relationship cerebral desaturations measure clinical variable p value &lt; 0.05 consider significant</detailed_description>
