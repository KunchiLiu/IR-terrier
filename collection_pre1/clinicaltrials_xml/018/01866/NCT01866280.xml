	<brief_summary>The purpose study test effect sleep meal timing , independent sleep duration , glucose regulation metabolic hormonal control energy balance normal weight adult . This study 4-phase , randomize control study 5 day participant undergo 2 phase late sleep time differ meal timing ( normal late ) 2 phase normal sleep time differ meal timing ( normal late ) . The Aims Hypotheses study : Aim 1 : To compare hormonal regulation food intake metabolic risk marker response alter sleep meal timing . - Hypothesis 1 : There interaction sleep meal time glucose , insulin , glucose insulin area curve glucose tolerance test late sleep/late meal result bad metabolic profile , normal sleep/late meal late sleep/normal meal intermediate profile , normal sleep/normal meal result best metabolic profile . - Hypothesis 2 : There interaction sleep meal time leptin ghrelin concentration late sleep/late meal time phase result low leptin/high ghrelin , normal sleep/late meal time late sleep/normal meal intermediate profile , normal sleep/normal meal time result high leptin/low ghrelin . Aim 2 : To compare food intake 24-h period response alter sleep meal timing . â€¢ Hypothesis 3 : Energy fat intake great late sleep timing phase compare normal sleep timing .</brief_summary>
