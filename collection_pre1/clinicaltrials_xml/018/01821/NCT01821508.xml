	<brief_summary>This prospective , open , randomize study involve 72 patient microvascular complication type 2 diabetes mellitus obesity , undergo gastric bypass ( Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ARM A ) receive best medical treatment ( ARM B , control arm ) . The aim study evaluate effect Roux-en-Y gastric bypass control diabetic nephropathy diabetic patient BMI 30 35 kg/m2 . The medical community confront many different study use various methodology investigate best pharmacological treatment type 2 diabetes mellitus . The treatment algorithm offer several different option accord stage disease ( different study ) . In addition , new drug develop year , always guarantee effective type 2 diabetes mellitus control [ MENDES , 2010 ] . Furthermore , drug prevent development disease , consequently increase risk microvascular macrovascular complication . Conversely , considerable evidence surgery adequate tool promote type 2 diabetes mellitus remission patient unresponsive clinical treatment . Gastric bypass surgery one popular bariatric surgery world , effect microvascular macrovascular complication type 2 diabetes mellitus establish . Specialists suggest rapid uncontrollable decrease blood glucose add concern surgery may paradoxically cause exacerbation microvascular complication [ LEOW , 2005 ] , whereas gradual improvement blood glucose gastric bypass surgery may prevent paradoxical worsening , lead interruption process , even retinopathy , nephropathy , neuropathy remission . However , study compare result two type treatment ( clinical vs. surgical ) similar population assess development microvascular complication type 2 diabetes mellitus . Therefore , order clarify doubt , necessary extremely desirable conduct randomize control trial compare gastric bypass best modern clinical treatment . Its finding could direct impact hundred million diabetic allow inclusion surgical treatment safe feasible therapeutic option significant portion patient .</brief_summary>
