	<detailed_description>Cognitive impairment , commonly report difficulty memory executive function , widely recognize clinical challenge person &gt; 65 year old HF . Although degree cognitive impairment usually meet criterion dementia , affect individual 's ability process remember information , complex medication regimens [ 5 ] . Findings suggest brain region support memory ( i.e . temporal lobe ) executive function ( i.e . prefrontal cortex ) may alter old person HF ; suggest brain alteration related HF disease process normal age . Surprisingly , despite high prevalence cognitive impairment HF , relationships brain cognition well study . Little known relationship brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) cognitive impairment old person HF . A limited number study investigate brain MRI adult HF produce conflict result . Three study utilize structural MRI technique identify evidence atrophy temporal lobe , hippocampus , prefrontal cortex increase volume white matter hyperintensities [ 6-8 ] . Brain hypoperfusion , operationalized decrease global cerebral perfusion , identify two study [ 9 , 10 ] . Only one study examine relationship brain MRI cognitive impairment HF [ 6 ] . Vogels et al. , ( 2007 ) find atrophy medial temporal lobe associate decreased measure memory executive function . White matter hyperintensities correlate cognitive measure . Limited research finding indicate various brain alteration temporal lobe , hippocampus , prefrontal cortex contribute cognitive impairment HF . However , previous finding limit use low resolution scanner ( 1.5 Tesla ) , lack MRI technique ( i.e . structural perfusion scan ) recruitment mixed age sample . Based limitation , purpose research plan explore relationship brain MRI cognitive impairment old person HF use high resolution structural perfusion scan . To accomplish goal , investigator compare 40 adult HF &gt; 65 year old 40 healthy , gender , age , education match control . Investigators obtain neuropsychological measure multiple domain , well MRI measurement temporal lobe prefrontal cortex baseline 12-months . The follow specific aim investigate : Aim 1 : Compare brain MRI old person HF control baseline 12-months . Hypothesis 1a : Older person HF increase white matter hyperintensities , decrease grey matter volume , decreased perfusion temporal lobe prefrontal cortex compare control . Hypothesis 1b : Older person HF exhibit great decline grey matter volume temporal lobe prefrontal cortex 12-months compare control . Aim 2 : Compare cognitive function old person HF control baseline 12-months . Hypothesis 2a ) : Older person HF perform low measure memory executive function compare control . Hypothesis 2b ) : Older person HF exhibit great decline measure memory executive function 12-months compare control . Aim 3 : Examine relationship brain MRI cognitive function old person HF control baseline . Hypothesis 3a : Decreased grey matter perfusion temporal lobe increase volume white matter hyperintensities temporal lobe associate decreased memory score . Hypothesis 3b : Decreased grey matter perfusion prefrontal cortex increase volume white matter hyperintensities prefrontal cortex associate decreased executive function score .</detailed_description>
