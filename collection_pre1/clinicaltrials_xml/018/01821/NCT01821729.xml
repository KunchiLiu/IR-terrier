	<brief_summary>This Phase II clinical trial , test safety effectiveness investigational combination drug learn whether combination drug work treat specific cancer . `` Investigational '' mean combination drug study . It also mean FDA yet approve type cancer . Proton beam radiation therapy FDA approve radiation delivery system . Conventional radiation therapy use photon treat cancer patient undergo surgery remove tumor . In study use radiation proton , spare surround tissue organ radiation . Proton radiation delivers radiation area require radiation dose beyond treatment area . This may reduce side effect patient would normally experience conventional radiation therapy . Researchers laboratory discover pathway inside cancer cell contribute growth survival tumor . The FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy regimen combination drug 5-fluorouracil , leucovorin oxaliplatin . These chemotherapy drug , along chemotherapy drug capecitabine , work block pathway thereby prevent tumor growth . Capecitabine FDA approve use alone drug treat type advance cancer , pancreatic cancer . In past research study , FOLFIRINOX follow radiation therapy capecitabine identify effective active chemotherapy patient cancer spreading , use treat type cancer . Losartan classify angiotensin-receptor blocker ( ARB ) , FDA approve use people high blood pressure . Recent study people different type cancer , include pancreatic cancer , show combine chemotherapy drug ARB help reduce/stop tumor growth effectively chemotherapy alone . Losartan use previous research study , information research study suggest drug combination FOLFIRINOX capecitabine may better treat type cancer . In research study , seek determine whether combine FOLFIRINOX Losartan proton radiation therapy efficient control growth shrink tumor FOLFIRINOX alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If willing participate research study , ask undergo screening test procedure confirm eligible . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn take part research study . If test procedure recently , may may repeat . These test procedure include medical history , routine physical exam , performance status , assessment tumor , routine blood test , blood sample check kidney function serum urine pregnancy test applicable . If test show eligible participate research study , begin study treatment . If meet eligibility criterion , able participate research study . There two phase study . Phase I involve FOLFIRINOX Losartan . The treatment plant begin 8 cycle FOLFIRINOX . Each cycle 14 day , 2 week long . FOLFIRINOX comprise four drug : Oxaliplatin , irinotecan , fluorouracil leucovorin . On Day 1 14 day cycle , receive oxaliplatin via IV infusion period 2 hour . Irinotecan administer via IV infusion Day 1 cycle period 90 minute . You receive fluorouracil ( 5FU ) Day 1 cycle via IV infusion period 2-4 minute . You fit ambulatory infusion pump deliver continuously 46-48 hour . In addition infusion , FOLFIRINOX always administer along two hour IV infusion leucovorin , drug compose reduce folic acid , help enhance effect chemotherapy . You give leucovorin vein arm 2 hour day Day 1 cycle . You also receive injection Neulasta FOLFIRINOX treatment . Neulasta use reduce chance infection chemotherapy boost white blood cell count . It administer 24-48 hour FOLFIRINOX infusion ( Day 3 4 ) . You take one dose Losartan mouth every day Phase I 8 cycle FOLFIRINOX . If dose Losartan give first week give serious side effect , dose increase remainder Phase I . We provide drug diary instruction take tablet incase miss vomited dos . We monitor response treatment chest/abdominal CT four cycle FOLFIRINOX therapy ( 8 week ) . Phase II involve Restaging/Proton Beam Radiation Therapy Capecitabine . At time study doctor assess progress cancer FOLFIRINOX + Losartan treatment via CT scan . If cancer progress , remove study continue standard care treatment . If progress , continue proton radiation therapy capecitabine phase study . During phase receive proton beam radiation therapy Francis H. Burr Proton Therapy center 1 week , Monday Friday . Each visit expect take 30-45 minute . During week proton radiation therapy week , take capecitabine mouth Monday Friday , total ten day . You give drug diary instruction take capecitabine case miss vomit dose . You receive follow test procedures various time point portion study . These test procedure include : routine blood test , blood sample check kidney function , CA19-9 CEA blood test , Chest CT/Abdominal-Pelvic CT , assessment side effect , vital sign , performance status , routine physical exam blood pressure monitoring . After final dose study drug come clinic follow-up visit assessment every 3 month cancer progress . You undergo follow test : routine physical exam , vital sign , performance status , routine blood test , assessment side effect . In addition require chest abdominal/pelvic CT every 6 month first two year , yearly year 3-5 . We would like keep track medical condition rest life . We would like call telephone year see . Keeping touch checking condition every year help u look long term effect research study .</detailed_description>
