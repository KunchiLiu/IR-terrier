	<brief_title>Strength Strength-ratio Hip Rotator Muscles Soccer Players</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nontraumatic hip injury problem often see Soccer Players . A biomechanical formation mechanism probably . Little research focus measurement hip external internal rotation strength soccer player . The purpose study investigate influence soccer sport isometric force force ratio hip rotator muscle system . Two sample Athletes compare : Soccer Players ( N15 ) Non-soccer player ( N15 ) match sex , age level physical activity investigate hip rotator force 3 different angle hip flexion ( 0°/45°/90° ) . The measurement make handheld dynamometer .</detailed_description>
