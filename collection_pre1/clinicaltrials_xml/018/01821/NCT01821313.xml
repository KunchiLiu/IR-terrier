	<brief_summary>The purpose study examine effect high intensity interval exercise ( HIIE ) inflammation endothelial dysfunction find child obesity . Our work hypothesis , compare obese child prescribe moderate exercise , obese child prescribe HIIE demonstrate great improvement endothelial function inflammatory marker follow 6-week exercise intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity , even child , generally accompany state chronic inflammation . To combat childhood obesity , clinician scientist recommend lifestyle intervention include increased physical activity exercise attempt promote weight loss , consequently , decrease comorbidities associate excess adiposity . More importantly , appear influence regular exercise may offer child obesity multitude health benefit , independent weight loss . However , intensity exercise require elicit significant health benefit still unclear . Therefore , aim present project study influence high intensity interval exercise ( HIIE ) exist inflammatory state find obesity . Specifically , propose project examine endothelial function marker inflammation , TNFa , IL-6 , hsCRP , adiponectin , child obesity exercise intervention . The data use determine change value differ magnitude base intensity exercise . Children obesity randomize either moderate exercise HIIE group , attend session 3 time per week 6 week . The moderate group cycle continuously 30 minute 65 % -70 % maximal heart rate HIIE group perform ten , 2-minute bout 90 % -95 % maximal heart rate . Outcome measure body composition , aerobic capacity , blood lipid , glucose metabolism , endothelial function , inflammation measure pre- post-intervention . Results may help establish exercise protocol child obesity , also inflammatory disease diabetes , cancer , arthritis .</detailed_description>
