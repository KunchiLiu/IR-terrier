The duration subject 's illness whether treat untreated must ≥ 6 month . Subject PANSS total score ≥ 80 PANSS subscale score ≥ 4 ( moderate ) 2 follow PANSS subscale item : delusion , conceptual disorganization , hallucination , unusual thought content screen baseline . Subject CGIS score ≥ 4 screen baseline . Subject acute exacerbation psychotic symptom ( longer 2 month ) mark deterioration function baseline ( history ) subject hospitalize purpose treat acute psychotic exacerbation 2 consecutive week less immediately screen . Subjects hospitalize 2 week reason unrelated acute exacerbation include concurrence Medical Monitor hospitalization reason acute relapse . For example , subject long term hospital set acute exacerbation transfer acute unit eligible study entry . Subject pregnant ( must negative serum pregnancy test screening ) nursing ( must lactate ) planning pregnancy within project duration study . Female subject reproductive potential agrees remain abstinent use adequate reliable contraception throughout study least 30 day last dose lurasidone take . In Investigator 's judgment , subject adhere requirement . Adequate contraception define continuous use either two barrier method ( eg , condom spermicide diaphragm spermicide ) hormonal contraceptive . Acceptable hormonal contraceptive include follow : ) contraceptive implant ( Norplant® ) implant least 90 day prior screen ; b ) injectable contraception ( medroxyprogesterone acetate injection ) give least 14 day prior screen ; c ) oral contraception take direct least 30 day prior screen . Subjects nonreproductive potential , ie , subject surgically sterile , undergone tubal ligation , postmenopausal ( define least 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea 6 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) concentration within postmenopausal range determine laboratory analysis ) require remain abstinent use adequate contraception . Subject able agrees remain prior antipsychotic medication duration study Subject stable living arrangement time screen agrees return similar living arrangement discharge . This criterion mean exclude subject temporarily leave stable living arrangement ( eg , due psychosis ) . Such subject remain eligible participate protocol . Chronically homeless subject enrol . Subject good physical health basis medical history , physical examination , laboratory screening . Subject require concomitant medication treatment follow agent may include stable dos ( ie , minor adjustment ) specify time : 1 ) oral hypoglycemics must stable least 30 day prior screen , 2 ) antihypertensive agent must stable least 30 day prior screen , 3 ) thyroid hormone replacement must stable least 90 day prior screen .

Subject demonstrate evidence acute hepatitis , clinically significant chronic hepatitis , evidence clinically significant impaired hepatic function clinical laboratory evaluation . Note : Subjects serum alanine transaminase ( ALT ) aspartate transaminase ( AST ) level great equal 3 time upper limit reference range provide central laboratory require retesting . If retesting laboratory value remain great equal 3 time upper limit , subject exclude . Subject history stomach intestinal surgery condition could interfere judge Investigator interfere absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion study drug . Subject Type 1 Type 2 insulindependent diabetes . Subject newly diagnose Type 2 diabetes screen . Subject Type 2 diabetes eligible study inclusion follow condition meet screening : subject currently treat oral antidiabetic medication ( ) , dose must stable least 4 week prior screen . Such medication may adjust discontinue study , clinically indicate . Subject abnormal laboratory parameter screen indicates clinically significant medical condition determine Investigator . Subjects fast blood glucose screen ≥ 126 mg/dL ( 7.0 mmol/L ) HbA1c ≥ 6.5 % exclude . Note : Subjects random ( nonfasting ) blood glucose screen ≥ 200 mg/dL ( 11.1 mmol/L ) must retested fasted state . Subject prolactin concentration &gt; 100 ng/mL screen history pituitary adenoma . Subject history malignancy &lt; 5 year prior sign inform consent , except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer situ cervical cancer . Pituitary tumor duration exclude . Subject judge resistant antipsychotic treatment define one following : 1. failure respond &gt; 2 market antipsychotic agent , give adequate dose adequate duration ( within past 2 year ) 2. history treatment clozapine refractory psychosis Subject receive antipsychotic medication maximum recommend ( countryspecific ) dose prior screening , judgment Investigator , unlikely respond standard dose lurasidone . Subject receive depot antipsychotic unless last injection least one treatment cycle least 30 day ( whichever longer ) , prior screen phase .
