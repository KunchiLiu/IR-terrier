	<brief_summary>This study evaluate efficacy ultra low dose danazol ( Optina ) treatment diabetic macular edema versus placebo . Optina already grant 505 ( b ) 2 status FDA incorporate safety data prior FDA approval . Additional safety data collect specifically low dosage . This study identify population subject Optina demonstrate therapeutic effect . A portion 505 ( b ) 2 drug approve base single clinical trial .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Study Level 1 . Subject willing able provide inform consent study participation 2 . Male female 18 year old Type 1 2 diabetes mellitus [ define selfreport diabetes accompany treatment ( insulin diet ) history fast plasma glucose ≥ 7.0 mmo/l ( 126 mg/dl ) 2hr plasma glucose ≥ 11.1 mmo/l ( 200 mg/dl ) ] 3 . Female subject childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 7 day prior randomization must agree utilize reliable form effective contraception ( hormonal barrier method ; abstinence ) throughout study 90 day last dose study medication . Childbearing potential defined woman menses within past 12 month , tubal ligation bilateral oophorectomy [ Note : patient use contraceptive method contain progesterone ( include progesterone IUD ) 90 day prior randomization planning use progesterone contraceptive method ( include progesterone IUD ) study drug treatment period eligible enrollment . ] Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately 4 . Enrollment study contraindicate pregnant lactating woman . Thus , female patient postmenopausal without menstrual period ≥ 12 month , surgical sterility , pregnant breast feed 90 day prior randomization enrol 5 . At least one eye meet study eye criterion inclusion study ( see Study Eye Inclusion Criteria , ) 6 . Stable diabetic metabolic control ( major change diabetic lipid reduce medication 3 month prior start study determine Investigator ) Study Eye Inclusion Criteria ( eye meet criterion , eye study eye ) 1 . Change VA within previous 12 month reasonably believe associated DME opinion Investigator 2 . BCVA accordance ETDRS letter score ≥24 ( e.g. , 20/320 good ) ≤78 ( e.g. , 20/32 bad ) 3 . Definite retinal thickening ≥275 micron spectraldomain OCT due DME involve center macula clinical exam opinion Investigator 4 . Media clarity , pupillary dilation , patient cooperation sufficient adequate fundus photograph 5 . Assessment Investigator focal photocoagulation defer safely 16 week Study Level 1 . Known allergy danazol ( Cyclomen® Danocrine® ) nonmedicinal component danazol test drug ( cornstarch , lactose , magnesium stearate , gelatin , talc ) ( Note : Lactose intolerance contraindication ingest small amount lactose contain oral medication ) 2 . Known allergy component placebo test drug ( lactose , magnesium stearate , gelatin ) 3 . History systemic ( e.g. , oral , intravenous , intramuscular , subcutaneous , intrauterine , epidural , bursal , implant ) androgen , progesterone corticosteroid ( include topical ophthalmic corticosteroid preparation within 4 month prior randomization ( topical nonophthalmic corticosteroid exclude ) 4 . Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 mm Hg ( case either systolic diastolic limit exceed , blood pressure remeasured 10 minute rest period inclusion study ) 5 . HbA1c great 11 % consistent HbA1c value similar range last 6 month . 6 . Carcinoma breast 7 . Prostate cancer 8 . Androgendependent tumor 9 . Undiagnosed abnormal genital bleeding 10 . Genital neoplasia 11 . Currently take warfarin ( coumadin ) , carbamazepine , phenytoin , phenobarbital cyclosporin tacrolimus 12 . Females pregnant plan pregnancy 6month period randomization ( Note : Enrollment study contraindicate pregnant lactating woman ) 13 . Females breast feed breast feed 90 day prior randomization ( Note : Enrollment study contraindicate pregnant lactating woman ) 14 . Use hormonal therapy include hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) contraceptive medication contain progesterone within 3 month randomization ( Note : patient pure estrogen estradiol replacement therapy enrol study ) 15 . Unstable cardiovascular disease history significant heart disease ( include unstable angina , acute coronary syndrome , myocardial infarction , history coronary revascularization procedure ) within 6 month randomization 16 . Any condition , opinion Investigator , would preclude participation study ( e.g. , unstable medical status include blood pressure glycemic control ) . Patients poor glycemic control , within last 3 month , use new type insulin ( example , change add short act insulin longeracting insulin ) , increase daily dose ≥ 50 % , initiate intensive insulin treatment insulin pump additional daily injection plan next 3 month enrol . 17 . Significant hepatic disease ( defined aspartate aminotransferase , alanine aminotransferase alkaline phosphatase [ ALP ] , twice upper limit normal ) , opinion Investigator , danazol might contraindicate 18 . Significant renal disease ( define serum creatinine ≥ 2.5 mg/dl , history renal transplant , undergoing dialysis screening ) , opinion Investigator , danazol might contraindicate 19 . Changes antihypertensive medication within 3 month randomization ( except dosage adjustment consider minor opinion Investigator ) 20 . Major surgery ( e.g. , head neck , chest , abdomen , gastrointestinal , genitourinary central nervous system ) within past 28 day anticipate next 6 month 21 . History acute intermittent porphyria , thrombosis thromboembolic disease pseudotumor cerebri 22 . Participation investigational trial within 30 day study entry involve treatment drug receive regulatory approval time study entry 23 . Patient expect move area clinical center next 6 month Study Eye 1 . Macular edema consider due cause DME ; e.g. , cataract extraction , vitreoretinal interface disease ( taut posterior hyaloid epiretinal membrane ) 2 . An ocular condition present , opinion Investigator , VA would improve resolution macular edema ( e.g. , foveal atrophy , closure juxafoveal capillary , dense subfoveal hard exudate ) 3 . An ocular condition ( diabetic retinopathy ) , opinion Investigator , might affect macular edema alter VA course study , e.g. , vein occlusion , uveitis ocular inflammatory disease , IrvineGass Syndrome , etc . 4 . Substantial cataract , opinion Investigator , likely interfere ocular measurement evaluation study 5 . History treatment DME time past 8 week ( focal/grid macular photocoagulation , intravitreal peribulbar corticosteroid , antivascular endothelial growth factor [ VEGF drug ] , treatment ) . Note , 28day screening period allow subject screen 4 week post DME treatment baseline visit 28 day later . 6 . History panretinal scatter photocoagulation ( PRP ) within 4 month prior randomization anticipate need PRP 6 month follow randomization 7 . History major ocular surgery ( include cataract extraction , scleral buckle , intraocular surgery , etc . ) within prior 6 month anticipate within next 6 month follow randomization 8 . History YAG capsulotomy perform within 2 month prior randomization 9 . Uncontrolled glaucoma ( Investigator 's judgment ) study eye 10 . Aphakia</criteria>
