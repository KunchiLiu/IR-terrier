	<brief_summary>Paclitaxel , widely use chemotherapeutic agent , associate several well-known side effect include neuropathy ( weakness , numbness pain ) generalize body ache . The latter recently describe paclitaxel-associated acute pain syndrome ( P-APS ) often occur first three four day administration . It affect 58-90 % patient . Currently , mechanism P-APS unknown , standard care treat . However , intervention anti-inflammatory well neuroprotective property would ideal candidate test prevention P-APS subsequent development peripheral neuropathy . Previous study suggest omega-3 fatty acid may act neuroprotective agent , currently document safety concern combine use paclitaxel . Therefore , randomize pilot clinical trial determine whether omega-3 fatty acid treat pain patient breast ovarian cancer receive paclitaxel .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>One mechanism propose P-APS early inflammatory process characterize macrophage activation dorsal root ganglia peripheral nerve occur shortly paclitaxel therapy . Morphologic alteration DRG satellite cell note upregulation proinflammatory cytokine hypothesize early event development neuropathy . Therefore , possible paclitaxel-induced neuropathic pain may mediate pro-inflammatory cytokine . If P-APS chronic neuropathy indeed part continuum , inflammatory pathway would reasonable target therapy . While mechanism paclitaxel lead development neuropathy still understood , hypothesize microtubule-stabilizing effect disrupt axonal transport . Intervention agent anti-inflammatory well neuroprotective therefore worth explore . Long chain omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) , common dietary supplement . They well establish anti-inflammatory property serve basis use therapeutic trial inflammatory condition . Omega -3 fatty acid consumption attenuate production pro-inflammatory metabolite . In addition , generate local mediator facilitate resolution inflammation . Thus , P-APS indeed mediate inflammation , anti-inflammatory activity omega 3 fatty acid may one mechanism prevent P-APS . Additionally , give well establish safety profile , may attractive alternative NSAIDS . A dose least 2.7 g/day EPA DHA report analgesic effect inflammatory condition . The dose 4 g/day FDA-approved dose omega 3 fatty acid ( Lovaza ) treatment hypertriglyceridemia well-documented toxicity profile . On basis , dose 4 g/day select study . Lovaza ( omega-3-acid ethyl ester ) capsule use . Each 1-gram capsule contain approximately 465 mg EPA 375 mg DHA .</detailed_description>
