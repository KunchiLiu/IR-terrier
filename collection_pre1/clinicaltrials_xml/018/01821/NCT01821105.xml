	<brief_summary>This pilot phase II study well compute tomography ( CT ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) image work detect disease patient undergo surgery metastatic colorectal cancer . Diagnostic procedure , CT PET scan , do surgery may help find colorectal cancer help guide surgery</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>2 Phase Comparison Pre-operative CT PET Images Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility rigidly ( linearly ) register PET CT image apply fuse dataset guide surgery image-guided navigation system handheld positron probe order facilitate disease detection improve resection accuracy advance stage colorectal cancer . II . To complete development software nonlinear registration PET CT datasets . OUTLINE : Patients undergo preoperative whole-body PET scan CT scan abdomen pelvis . Patients receive 18 F fludeoxyglucose ( FDG ) intravenously ( IV ) 60-90 minute prior surgery undergo intraoperative CT scan use handheld probe computer navigation system .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients histologicallyconfirmed colorectal carcinoma preoperative PET scan evidence hypermetabolic lesion suspicious cancer eligible study . In case primary cancer , must tissueconfirmed diagnosis . In recurrent case , patient must clinical evidence CT MRI disease suitable resection . Patients must candidate clinically indicate surgery . Patients recurrent disease may prior surgery and/or chemotherapy limit number prior therapeutic procedure chemotherapeutic regimen . Patients must performance status 0 , 1 2 ECOG ( Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ) standard . Patients must give write informed consent include consent IV line place FDG administration . Patients must least 18 year age . Children age 18 exclude study due rarity colorectal cancer child . Because radiolabeled agent know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use acceptable form contraception prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Organ function requirement : Patients must organ marrow function adequate undergo laparotomy . Specifically : Serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dl Serum bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl AST ( aspartate aminotransferase , serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase , serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase , serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase ) [ SGOT ] /ALT [ SGPT ] &lt; 4 time institutional upper limit normal Total WBC ( white blood cell ) &gt; 4,000/mm3 ANC ( absolute neutrophil count ) &gt; 1,500/mm3 Platelets &gt; 100,000/mm3 Hgb &gt; 10g/dl Patient must clinically significant cardiac disease ( New York Heart Association Class III/IV ) ; serious infection require treatment antibiotic ; serious illness illness require use steroid ; clinically significant pulmonary disease illness would contraindicate increase risk complication surgery . Fasting blood sugar le 120 mg/dl Patients active CNS ( central nervous system ) tumor involvement ineligible . Any patient retain childbearing potential pregnant lactating must use adequate contraception assure avoidance conception . Body size prohibits use diagnostic equipment ( portable CT scanner ) . Tumor burden great ( determined preoperative PET scan intraoperative finding ) surgery advise . If lesion detect preoperative CT PET scan ( word , patient positive PET scan part inclusion criterion ) .</criteria>
