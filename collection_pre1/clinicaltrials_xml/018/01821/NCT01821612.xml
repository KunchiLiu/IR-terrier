	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study combination chemotherapy radiation therapy surgery follow gemcitabine hydrochloride treat patient pancreatic cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , oxaliplatin , irinotecan hydrochloride , leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , gemcitabine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Radiation therapy use high-energy x-ray kill tumor cell . Giving combination chemotherapy radiation therapy surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove . Giving chemotherapy surgery may kill tumor cell remain surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate new treatment program patient borderline resectable pancreas cancer order determine effect , good bad , chemotherapy chemoradiation cancer see allow safe surgery . Primary Objectives : - To assess accrual rate study . - To assess rate treatment-related toxicity treatment delay preoperative therapy . - To assess rate completion preoperative operative therapy . Secondary Objectives : - To assess macroscopic ( R0/R1 ) resection rate . - To estimate rate radiographic histopathologic response preoperative therapy . - To estimate time locoregional distant recurrence . - To assess overall survival ( OS ) . - To retrieve nucleic acid pretreatment pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma biopsy assess quality nucleic acid use sequencing-based assessment tumor DNA .</detailed_description>
