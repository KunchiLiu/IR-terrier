	<brief_title>A Study Intra-operative Autologous Retropubic Urethral Sling Urinary Control After Robot Assisted Radical Prostatectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 2 single blind study patient undergo robot assist radical prostatectomy randomize placement autologous retropubic urethral sling . Placement retropubic urethral sling involve dissection harvest right leave va deferens , take body bed side assistant suture two va deferens together side side fashion small two va deferens place middle large one . A single 3-0 V-lock suture CV23 needle place one end va sling pass body bed side assistant . The sling place rectum site vesicourethral anastamosis anastamosis complete . The sling place around vesicourethral anastomosis , suspend pubic symphysis tensioned allow elevation vesicourethral anastomosis . There four surgeon work trial site involve perform radical prostatectomy sling placement trial patient . All surgeon significant experience perform radical prostatectomy ( &gt; 100 case ) . To ensure sufficient experience placement urethral sling , surgeon ( principle investigator , place 200 sling ) undergo train period 5 patient sling placement proctor principal investigator prior accrual first trial patient individual surgeon . All patient characterize respect age , ethnicity , BMI , prostate size , amount nerve sparing , preoperative urinary function , surgeon , serum PSA , tumor characteristic . Prostate size tumor characteristic attain histological assessment prostate specimen pathology department . Preoperative urinary function assess EPIC IPSS questionnaires baseline . The amount nerve spar assess surgeon perform radical prostatectomy prostate dissection complete . Each side assess separately complete , partial nerve spar . Stratification base upon age enrollment ( &lt; 65 year vs. &gt; 65 year ) . For 2 stratum patient randomize placement sling , serve control group , one one basis assignment determine use computer software program . Randomization assignment plan procedure balance use fixed block design . Consecutively identified patient undergo RARP meeting eligibility criteria trial approach involvement trial . Patients study personnel blind patient received sling . Surgeons perform individual procedure blind procedure , know randomization assignment prostate dissection complete procedure reach stage sling placement . A sealed envelope contain randomization assignment patient sling non-sling group place operating room front desk research coordinator prior start surgery . This envelope open prostate remove . A unique identifying number , association randomization allocation , assign trial patient . These number place envelope match patient avoid confusion day multiple trial patient may undergo radical prostatectomy . Furthermore , surgeon involve attain outcome data patient therefore cause bias study outcome . Investigators expect accrual 5 patient every week ; therefore , investigator estimate take approximately 37 week complete study accrual 182 evaluable patient .</detailed_description>
