	<brief_summary>Managing pain patient abuse prescription opioids present many challenge , include development opioid-induced hyperalgesia ( OIH ) . Hyperalgesia condition something usually feel slightly painful perceive something painful .

	<detailed_description>The clinical management pain prescription opioid abuser present challenge health care professional . Investigators novel pilot data show GABA-agonist gabapentin ( GPN ) significantly decrease opioid-induced hyperalgesia ( OIH ) methadone patient ( Compton et al. , 2009 ) , provide first empirical evidence pharmacotherapy OIH opioid abuser . The work Gore colleague ( 2011 ) show pregabalin ( PGB ) , GABA analogue succeed GPN , show decrease opioid use patient neuropathic pain patient , suggest anti-hyperalgesia effect observe matched cohort receive GPN . The propose research comprehensively evaluate efficacy PGB treat opioid-induced hyperalgesia ( OIH ) well-described population prescription opioid abuser ( POAs ) chronic pain Suboxone ( buprenorphine ) methadone therapy . A press need investigation present rise number POAs present treatment ( SAMHSA , 2010 ; 2011 ) , , chronic pain common co-morbidity . The proposed work anticipate provide vital timely information efficacy PGB treatment OIH prescription opioid abuser Suboxone methadone therapy . Following recruitment screening , 75 subject assign active medication group receive pregabalin 400 mg/day , dose well-within publish guideline 300-600 mg/day treatment neuropathic pain ( http : //www.pfizerpro.com/hcp/lyrica/phndosing ) . During first week treatment , subject quickly titrate assigned daily PGB dose 400 mg/day PO ( 50mg BID x 2 day ; 100mg BID x 2 day ; 150mg BID x 2 day , full dosage 400mg administer day 7 ) , maximum dose tolerate ) six week . 75 subject assign receive match undergo identical titration study activity double-blind condition . Study staff evaluate subject daily phone titration ; thereafter see weekly study session . Tapering medication begin end week 6 . The severity chronic pain measure time point use two standardized self report tool report pain severity ( McGill Pain Questionnaire ) pain-related disability ( Brief Pain Inventory ) . Opioid-induced hyperalgesia measure time point use standardized cold pressor trial , performance baseline compare performance follow PGB/placebo administration time .</detailed_description>
