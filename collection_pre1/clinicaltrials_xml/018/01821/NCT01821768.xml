	<brief_summary>This randomize clinical trial study two different test currently use detect spread breast cancer lymph node arm candidate breast conservation therapy . The two test sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB ) axillary ultrasound . The current standard care sentinel lymph node biopsy , surgical procedure . Axillary ultrasound ( AUS ) may good SLNB detect spread cancer without surgical risk .</brief_summary>
