	<brief_summary>The purpose study find effect , good and/or bad , stereotactic radiosurgery ( Gamma knife ) brain metastasis ( e ) . Gamma knife radiosurgery way give radiation therapy brain focus way , nearby part brain receive little exposure radiation . No incision involve . Imaging technology use pinpoint location tumor . In study , investigator also try find tumor and/or treatment affect brain function time . The investigator perform series neurocognitive assessment , test memory , reason , high brain function , treatment regular interval treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Single Arm Study Neurocognitive Outcomes Patients With Brain Metastases Managed With Stereotactic Radiosurgery ( SRS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , multi-institution , non-randomized trial neurocognitive outcome patient multiple , newly-diagnosed brain metastasis manage primarily stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) , specifically Gamma Knife ( GK ) system . The goal study enroll 45 patient 1-10 newly-diagnosed brain metastasis vary primary cancer large intracranial tumor volume ≤10 cc , ≤15 cc total tumor volume , absence leptomeningeal disease MRI , Karnofsky performance status ( KPS ) score ≥70 ( unless due intracranial disease ) , KPS expect improve ≥70 treatment . The enrolled patient expect fairly good pre-treatment cognitive function , define online neurocognitive function ( oNCF ) assessment score ≥70 ( within 2 standard deviation mean , 100 ) . All study participant undergo standard , pre-treatment clinical evaluation include : complete clinical/neurologic exam , performance status assessment , systemic staging , diagnostic MRI brain . Upon enrollment , patient undergo high-resolution MRI , include track density imaging ( TDI ) . The baseline neurocognitive function ( NCF ) assess short ( 20-30 minute ) online test battery complete patient home , CogState assessment ( 22 minute ) , well comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation ( 2-3 hour ) . The eligible patient subsequently go receive radiosurgical treatment brain metastasis . All patient treatment response assessment every 10-12 week consist clinical/neurologic exam , performance status evaluation , disease re-staging ( indicate ) , diagnostic MRI brain . If progressive disease identify ( radiographic progression treat lesion new brain lesion ) , patient consider `` salvage '' therapy include repeat SRS , whole-brain radiation therapy ( WBRT ) , surgery without brachytherapy best supportive care ( e.g . steroid ) . The preferred salvage therapy SRS provide re-treatment criterion meet . Along regular clinical MRIs , TDI obtain . Mandatory comprehensive follow-up test neuropsychologist ( 1-2 hour ) occur every 10-12 week , start 4 week completion SRS , continue interval even salvage therapy administer intracranial recurrence . Online NCF test ( oNCF CogState ) take place office set day comprehensive cognitive assessment . Patients also option web-based oNCF assessment home frequently every 2 week . These optional assessment include data analysis . All study participant follow death withdrawal study . The primary aim study validate oNCF battery demonstrate feasibility use patient metastatic brain disease . The former accomplish correlate finding oNCF test comprehensive neurocognitive function ( cNCF ) assessment neuropsychologist . Every attempt make identify image correlate neurocognitive function derive high-resolution MRI , TDI . The aggregate data combination lesion location information ( correspond treatment ) provide unique insight mechanism underlie radiation therapy ( RT ) -related brain injury . Because salvage therapy WBRT also permit likely necessary subset patient , insight may also gain relative extent , specificity , temporal evolution post-treatment NCF dysfunction treatment modality . The data gain pilot study could form basis future trial NCF outcome cancer patient , especially oNCF test battery validate may provide cost-effective method include NCF outcomes clinical trial .</detailed_description>
