	<criteria>Patients must histologically cytologically confirm recurrent epithelial ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal carcinoma . Histologic documentation original primary tumor require via pathology report . All patient must measurable disease . Measurable disease define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long dimension record ) . Each lesion must &gt; 20mm measured conventional technique include CT , MRI , &gt; 10 mm measure spiral CT . Patients must least one `` target lesion '' use assess response define RECIST . Tumors within previously irradiate field designate `` nontarget '' lesion unless progression document biopsy obtain confirm persistence least 90 day follow completion radiation therapy . Patients must one prior platinumbased chemotherapeutic regimen management primary disease contain carboplatin , cisplatin , another organoplatinum compound . This initial treatment may include intraperitoneal therapy , highdose therapy , consolidation , noncytotoxic agent extend therapy administer surgical nonsurgical assessment . Patients required receive least one additional cytotoxic regimen management recurrent persistent disease . Patients allow receive , required receive , biologic ( noncytotoxic ) therapy either alone part cytotoxic regimens management recurrent persistent disease . Age &gt; 18 year . Women race ethnic group include . Patients ECOG performance status &lt; 2 . ( see APPENDIX A ) Patients must normal organ marrow function define : absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/uL platelet &gt; 100,000/uL hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal Alkaline Phosphatase within normal institutional limit creatinine &lt; 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal Neurologic function : Neuropathy ( sensory motor ) less equal CTCAE v4.0 grade 2 . ( see APPENDIX B ) Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 28 day prior enter study whose adverse event due agent administer 28 day earlier continue grade 3 great . Patients may receive investigational agent within past 28 day . Any hormonal therapy immunotherapy direct malignant tumor must discontinue least one week prior enrollment . Continuation hormone replacement therapy permit . Continuation establish medical treatment know medical condition permit . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition Abraxane Bevacizumab . Patients prior therapy Abraxane . Patients receive radiation 25 % marrowbearing area . ( see APPENDIX C ) Patients history invasive malignancy , exception nonmelanoma skin cancer , exclude evidence malignancy present within last five year . Patients receive prior radiotherapy portion abdominal cavity pelvis OTHER THAN treatment ovarian , fallopian tube , primary peritoneal cancer within last five year exclude . Prior radiation localize cancer breast , head neck , skin permit , provide complete five year prior registration , patient remain free recurrent metastatic disease . Patients know active liver disease hepatitis . Patients active bleed pathologic condition carry high risk bleeding , know bleed disorder , coagulopathy , tumor involve major vessel . Patients history evidence upon physical examination CNS disease , include primary brain tumor , seizures control standard medical therapy , brain metastasis , history cerebrovascular accident ( CVA , stroke ) , transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) subarachnoid hemorrhage within 6 month first date treatment study . Patients clinically significant cardiovascular disease , include : uncontrolled hypertension , myocardial infarction , unstable angina within 6 month enrollment , NYHA Grade II great heart failure , serious cardiac arrhythmia require medication , grade II great peripheral vascular disease . Patients clinically significant proteinuria . Patients urine protein 1+ dipstick undergo 24hour urine collection , must demonstrate &lt; 100 mg protein/24 hr allow participation study . Patients know hypersensitivity Chinese hamster ovary cell product recombinant human humanize antibody . Patients major surgical procedure , open biopsy , significant traumatic injury within 28 day prior enrollment study , anticipation need major surgical procedure course study . Patients receive commercial bevacizumab within 28 day prior enrollment study . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection ( exception uncomplicated UTI ) , chronic non heal wound , bone fracture , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant lactate woman exclude study possible risk fetus infant . Known HIVpositive patient exclude study possible risk lethal infection treat marrow suppressive therapy . Safety data regard Abraxane use patient ascites available ; therefore patient symptomatic ascites exclude participation study . Patients may asymptomatic ascites .</criteria>
