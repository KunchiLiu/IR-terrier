	<brief_title>Study Low Level Laser Therapy Reduce Body Circumference Obese Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The American Society Plastic Surgeons ( ASPS ) 2011 report state market cosmetic procedure show significant growth past two year , 13.8 million cosmetic plastic surgery procedure perform United States 2011 , 5 % since 2010 . While surgical cosmetic procedure increase significantly 2010 2011 , overall growth cosmetic procedure primarily drive substantial rise minimally-invasive procedure . Cosmetic minimally-invasive procedure increase 6 % , nearly 12.2 million cosmetic minimally-invasive procedure perform 2011 . This highlight grow consumer demand non- minimally-invasive cosmetic procedure involve surgical procedure liposuction associate risk , potential complication lengthy painful recovery process . Low level laser light therapy , provide application Erchonia® Obesity Laser clinical study protocol , offer simple , non-invasive , safe , effective side-effect free alternative achieve body circumference reduction . Justification assertion anticipate safety effectiveness application Erchonia® Obesity Laser reduction body circumference find three FDA clearance Erchonia® Low Level Laser device body circumference reduction indication , follow : K123237 ( 532 nm green light diode ) : Erchonia® Zerona™ 2.0 Laser : indicate use non-invasive dermatological aesthetic treatment adjunct individual intend undergo liposuction procedure reduction circumference hip , waist , thigh . K121695 &amp; K082609 ( 635 nm red light diode ) : Erchonia® ML Scanner ( MLS ) &amp; Erchonia® Zerona : indicate use non-invasive dermatological aesthetic treatment adjunct individual intend undergo liposuction procedure reduction circumference hip , waist , thigh . K121690 &amp; K120257 ( 635 nm red light diode ) : Erchonia® MLS , Zerona , Zerona-AD : indicate use non-invasive dermatological aesthetic treatment adjunct individual intend undergo liposuction procedure reduction circumference upper arm . Therefore , Erchonia low level laser determine safe effective FDA application body circumference reduction indication multiple body area , evaluation application Erchonia Obesity Laser reduce body circumference overweight individual natural extension proven accept application body circumference reduction purpose .</detailed_description>
