	<brief_summary>Background : Vascular graft increasingly implant due increase prevalence atherosclerosis diabetes , 1-6 % vascular procedure complicate infection . Mortality attributable prosthetic vascular graft infection ( PVGI ) high . However , almost data regard best treatment option complicate infection . Most recommendation base expert opinion clinical trial cohort observational data analysis . Evaluating infectious complication vascular surgery procedure important , additionally , study may offer insight quality improvement improve patient outcome . With first aim investigator establish infrastructure study PVGI Zurich . Investigators take advantage Swissvasc registry , central registry collect preoperative , operative discharge data regard index vascular surgical intervention . They create prospective observational cohort database patient receive vascular graft ( peripheral , aortic , vein ) University hospital Zurich ( VASGRA Cohort A ) . Patients PVGI include VASGRA Cohort B follow use flow chart focus course infectious complication . Additionally , investigator establish biobank collection tissue- blood sample patient PVGI . With second aim researcher investigate different diagnostic , clinical therapeutic research question nest VASGRA Cohort . Firstly , address epidemiological question , : determine incidence outcome complication vascular graft placement ; determine risk factor , best treatment strategy outcome PVGI , determine influence different antibiotic regimen outcome PVGI due different bacterial pathogen . Secondly , investigator determine accuracy different image technique ( PET/CT MRI ) diagnosis PVGI , individual role assessment treatment response . Thirdly , investigator evaluate bacterial diversity vascular wound infection use 16 r-Ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) amplification , investigator explore whether bacterial diversity predict disease progression . Here , investigator also study impact negative pressure wound therapy ( NPWT ) bacterial diversity treatment course PVGI . Fourthly , investigator look cut-off level relevant blood leucocyte count , C-reactive protein procalcitonin raise suspicion PVGI . Lastly , investigator look histopathological feature excise vascular graft . Expected value project : Results propose study important contribution field , base large sample size , longitudinal design unify clinical epidemiological science . The well characterized patient group close connection vascular surgeon , infectious disease specialist , specialist nuclear medicine microbiologist help investigate PVGI depth . Investigators hope able develop guideline regard best diagnostic modality treatment option case vascular graft infection . In future plan examine bacteria retrieve PVGI laboratory detail . The recovered bacteria examine antimicrobial susceptibility capability form biofilms . Furthermore investigator examine bacterial recovery form explanted graft could optimize .</brief_summary>
