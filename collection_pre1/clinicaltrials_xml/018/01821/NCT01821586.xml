	<brief_summary>Diarrhoea malnutrition common childhood illness responsible high death develop county . Physiologically , malnourish child excrete low amount salts water diarrhoeal stool , also unable handle excessive salt water load . Some time find hyponatraemic due shift sodium inside cell ( inefficient Na+ /K+ pump ) , fluid contain high amount sodium ( standard ORS ) may lead increase intracellular sodium , fluid overload heart failure . They also deplete potassium store body . Recently , WHO recommend special ORS formulation , know ReSoMal , management diarrhoea severely malnourish child contains low amount sodium ( 45mmol/L ) high amount potassium ( 40 mmol/L ) standard WHO-ORS . It felt ORS contain low sodium high potassium concentration may useful correct hypokalemia , lower risk excess sodium /or overhydration , severely malnourished child diarrhoea . The safety ReSoMaL , however , still question due risk hyponatraemia , include symptomatic hyponatraemia , especially treatment severe watery diarrhoea due Vibrio cholerae ETEC loss sodium stool exceeds contain ReSoMal . Thus ORS solution modest concentration sodium ( 75 mmol/L ) high concentration potassium ( 40 mmol/L ) suggest treatment diarrhoea child . To improve efficacy oral rehydration , term reduce severity purge diarrhoea duration , different approach ( change substrates/ reduce sodium glucose concentration osmolarity ) try limited success . Benefiber ( partially hydrolyse guar gum ) , soluble fiber add ORS solution expect fermented colon liberate short chain fatty acid ( SCFAs ) . SCFAs stimulate sodium water absorption colon , trophic effect , act fuel source colonocytes , antibacterial property stimulate production commensal flora , thereby may enhance recovery acute diarrhoea severely malnourish child . The aim propose study examine whether ORS solution modest concentration sodium prevent occurrence hyponatraemia include symptomatic hyponatraemia , also whether addition benefiber improve efficacy ORS solution . This randomized , double blind , control clinical trial 186 child severe malnutrition watery diarrhoea ( 62 three treatment group ) compare efficacy ( ) currently recommend ORS modofication ( Na+ 75 mmol/L K40 momol/L minerals-Zinc , copper magnesium ) , ( ii ) ReSoMal ( Na+ 45 mmol/L ) , ( iii ) Currently recommend ORS ( Na+ 75 mmol/L , K 40 momol/L added mineral ) add Benefiber ( 25 grams/L ) , treatment acute watery diarrhoea child severe malnutrition</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Modified ORS Solution Severely Malnourished Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design This randomize , double-blind , control clinical trial ass efficacy three different modify ORSs : ( ) Currently recommend ORS modification ( Na+ 75 , K 40 mmol/L added mineral ) ; ( ii ) Resomal ( Na+ 45 ) ; ( iii ) Currently recommend ORS ( Na+ 75 , K 40 mmol/L added mineral ) add benefiber ( 25 grams/L ) treatment acute watery diarrhoea child severe malnutrition . STUDY POPULATION Children either sex , age 6 month 3 year , present acute watery diarrhoea &lt; 7 day duration screen . Sample Size The sample size study determine base following : 1 . Persistence hyponatraemia : We anticipate 10 % child remain hyponatraemic Modified ORS-1 treatment group compare 30 % child Modified ORS-2 ( ReSoMal ) . Assuming 5 % level significance 80 % power , sample size group 60 . 2 . Recovery diarrhoea : In recent clinical trial33 ORS solution severely malnourish child acute watery diarrhoea , mean +SD duration diarrhoea 66 ( 32 ) h. We anticipate 25 % reduction diarrhoea duration child receive Benefiber-added ORS . Considering 5 % level significance 80 % power require sample size group 59 . 3 . Anticipating drop around 5 % need 62 child group . Randomization After enrolment study patient randomize receive one follow three solution : 4 . Case Management : Following standardize protocol management severely malnourish child use ICDDR , B hospital 20,23 . 5.1 Fluid therapy ( oral ) Dehydration assess accord WHO guideline , modify last multicentre clinical trial reduce osmolarity ORS adult cholera child watery diarrhoea ( 17 ) . In child dehydration , fluid deficit correct assigned ORS @ 10ml/kg/hr first two hour , 5ml /kg/hr deficit correct . In addition , go stool loos replace @ 5-10 ml/kg/hr watery stool . For high purging patient , ORS intake adjust accord ongoing stool loss . ORS therapy continue diarrhoea cease . Children severe dehydration , initial rehydration do IV fluid ( cholera saline ) patient shock disappearance sign severe dehydration rest rehydration do rehydration patient dehydration describe . 5.2 Management infection : Children without apparent extraintestinal infection receive Inj ampicillin 100 mg/kg.24 h 3 divided dos Inj . Gentamicin @ 5ml/kg.24 h 2 divide dos 5 day . Children low respiratory tract infection receive Inj . Ceftriaxone 75 mg /kg.day 5 day , cholera receive syrup Azithromycin 20 mg/kg within 20 minute randomization . 5.3 Diet : Mothers advise continue breastfeeding . Supplementary feed milk suji ( milk , rice powder mixture , energy 70 kcal/100ml ) give 10 ml/Kg.feed two hourly day 1 increase slowly 150 Kcal/Kg.day 7 day accord demand . If child poor appetite , weak , painful stomatitis glossitis , food deliver nasogastric tube able take food orally . Additionally , semisolid food ( Rice , lentil , vegetable etc . ) give old child convalescent rehabilitation phase . 5.4 Vitamin Mineral Supplements Children old one year without xeropthalmia give 200,000 unit vitamin A 6-12 month age give 100,000 unit vitamin A admission . Children xeropthalmia receive dose three occasion : admission , follow day , discharge . Folic acid 1.25 mg elemental zinc 2 mg/kg give discharge medicine supply patient continue upto 15 day . Children also receive multivitamin drop ( 1 ml contains Vit A palmitate 5000 IU , vitamin D 1000 IU , thiamine hydrochloride 1.6 mg , riboflavin 1 mg , pyridoxine hydrochloride 1 mg , nicotinamide 10 mg , calcium D- pantothenate 5 mg , ascorbic acid 50 mg ) dose 1 ml twice daily discharge medicine supply patient continue upto 15 day ( half dose infant , age &lt; 1 year ) . Hypoglycemia ( blood glucose &lt; 3.0 mmol/L ) manage 50 ml 10 % glucose orally nasogastric tube . Inj 25 % glucose 2 ml/kg give level blood glucose 1.5 mmol/L . Hyponatraemia ( serum sodium &lt; 115 mmol/L without symptom ) manage Inj . 3 % NaCl 12 ml/kg I/V slowly 4 hour . 5 . Measurements 6.1 Fluids intake ( IV , ORS water ) every 6 hour IV fluid infuse calibrated soluset , amount infuse note every 6 hour patient receiving ; ORS supply measure calibrate cylinder amount intake note every 6 hour , leave deduct previous offer . Water also measure similar way . 6.2 Output ( stool , urine vomit ) every 6 hour . Stool collect bucket know weight beneath cholera cot central hole measure every 6 hour electronic scale precision 1g . Urine collect pediatric urine collector bag measure calibrated cylinder ml . Vomit collect pre-weighed bowl measure electronic scale 6.3 Food intake every 6 hour The child offer define food know calorie measure electronic scale precision 1g . Any leave measure subtracted amount offer amount ingest record every 6 hour . The calorie intake estimate amount diet child consume . 6.4 Nude body weight measured admission , rehydration every 6 hour recovery diarrhoea end every 24 hour discharge</detailed_description>
