	<brief_summary>The goal TAOS study determine best procedure knee amputation . There two different procedure currently use surgeon around county : Erlt procedure Burgess procedure . Proponents Ertl procedure advocate surgical formation tibia fibula bone bridge provide stability , shape weight bear capability residual limb result less pain well prosthetic fit alignment . This procedure popular especially among military 's advantage Burgess procedure well support current research . This study aim compare two amputation procedure adequately power randomized trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transtibial Amputation Outcomes Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>High-energy open fracture , blast , gunshot wind crush injury distal tibia , ankle , hind foot midfoot common challenge military civilian trauma surgeon ( Brown , 2009 ; Covey , 2002 ; Ficke , 2007 ; McGuigan , 2007 ; Hansen , 2001 ) . Many surgeon believe early transtibial amputation provide well long term functional outcome limb salvage injury ( Hansen , 2001 ; Myerson , 1994 ; Sanders , 1992 ; Turchin,1999 ; Shawen , 2010 ; Ellington 2012 ) . If transtibial amputation select treatment patient , controversy remain regard appropriate amputation technique . Many surgeon advocate amputation tibia-fibula synostosis technique ( Ertl procedure ) young active patient , believe procedure provide well prosthetic interface , end bear capacity soft tissue stability improve performance functional outcome . ( Pinto 2004 ; Pinzur 2006 ; Commuri 2010 ) . Others strongly advocate standard posterior flap ( Burgess procedure ) without synostosis , argue patient similar outcome fewer complication low cost . ( Pinzur 2008 ; Tindle 2011 ) To date , outcomes transtibial amputation technique subject appropriately powered prospective randomize clinical trial . The primary study objective compare functional outcome number revision surgery amputate limb first amputation patient undergo transtibial amputation randomize receive tibia-fibula synostosis ( Ertl procedure ) versus standard posterior flap procedure ( Burgess procedure ) . The secondary study objective compare level impairment patient undergo transtibial amputation randomize receive tibia-fibula synostosis ( Ertl procedure ) versus standard posterior flap procedure ( Burgess procedure ) ; compare level pain patient undergo transtibial amputation randomize receive tibia-fibula synostosis ( Ertl procedure ) versus standard posterior flap procedure ( Burgess procedure ) ; compare initial hospitalization overall treatment cost ( 18 month follow-up ) patient undergo transtibial amputation randomize receive tibia-fibula synostosis ( Ertl procedure ) versus standard posterior flap procedure ( Burgess procedure ) . Patients refuse randomization option participate prospective observational study type amputation decide surgeon patient .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients require unilateral transtibial amputation follow major limb trauma regardless injury occur The injury treatment must meet following criterion : The residual fibula fracture fracture , stabilize internal fixation allow either Ertl Burgess procedure Proximal tibia/fibula joint stabilize Soft tissue coverage allow atypical closure skin graft &lt; 100 cm2 Amputation result residual limb â‰¥10 cm joint line end tibia Ages 18 60 inclusive At time consent , patient Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ) motor score 04 GCS motor score 5 significant traumatic brain injury ( define AIS code 5 6 ) Patients wound closure require free tissue transfer Fibula fracture proximal tibial bone cut stabilize Late amputation presence one follow condition : ( ) infection within zone injury ; ( ii ) chronic regional pain syndrome ; ( iii ) posttraumatic thrombophlebitis Patient spinal cord deficit Patient previous leg foot amputation nonambulatory preinjury Patient third degree burn &gt; 10 % total surface area affect study limb Patient document psychiatric disorder Patient unable speak either English Spanish Severe problem maintain followup ( e.g . patient prisoner homeless time injury intellectually challenge without adequate family support ) .
