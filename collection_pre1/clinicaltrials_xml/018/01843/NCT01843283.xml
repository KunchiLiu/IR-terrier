	<detailed_description>Mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) affect many 20 % old adult great risk develop Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . MCI involve functional decline may include decrement engagement meaningful activity one 's sense confidence/mastery , associate depressive symptom , poor satisfaction family communication , decline physical function . Existing intervention MCI patient caregiver often focus single problem , memory physical activity available multi-faceted supportive care intervention meet need MCI patient caregiver order prevent premature disengagement risk depressive symptom . The Daily Enhancement Meaningful Activity ( DEMA ) intervention use family dyadic , strengths-based , positive health approach build exist dyadic skill value accomplish meaningful activity engagement address priority need efficacious intervention prevent premature disengagement depressive symptom MCI patient . The DEMA build investigator ' previous descriptive work gerontology theory , model human occupation , component Problem-Solving Therapy . The investigator ' preliminary finding show intervention measure acceptable , suggestion solicit participant improve delivery . The purpose pilot study 1 ) evaluate feasibility satisfaction revise DEMA intervention ; 2 ) estimate effect size intervention incorporation comparison group . The MCI-caregiver dyad ( n = 36 dyad ) randomize DEMA informational support group ; group receive 6 bi-weekly session ( 2 face-to-face 4-phone deliver ) train intervener . The data MCI patient caregiver outcomes collect pre-intervention , immediately ( two week ) post-intervention , 3 month post-program evaluation . Descriptive statistic analysis use satisfaction perception DEMA informational support group general linear mixed model use estimate effect size intervention proximal distal outcome . Findings inform design subsequent R01 : 1 ) test efficacy DEMA MCI patient-caregiver dyad longitudinal randomized clinical trial ; 2 ) explore costs/benefits implementation . If find efficacious , DEMA potential slow rate disability progression MCI AD improve quality life outcomes patient caregiver .</detailed_description>
