	<brief_summary>This study demonstrate safety application autologous platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) gel follow excision autologous skin graft acute deep 2nd 3rd degree burn . The study randomize , double-blinded control safety study . Investigators expect PRP deliver improve hemostasis growth factor wound site thus increase effectiveness treatment wound site . This lead rapid production delivery autologous therapy minimize additional morbidity patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The goal study demonstrate safety application autologous platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) gel follow excision autologous skin graft acute deep 2nd 3rd degree burn . This treatment intend stimulate rapid heal improve outcome standard care treatment burn common active duty military personnel , broadly treatment acute burn . The care specific excision split thickness skin graft context burn study . The study enroll 42 patient receive surgical management acute 2nd 3rd degree burn require excision skin grafting . The patient 's total body surface area burn injury exceed 20 % . The study conduct 12 month . This study provide information development enhance treatment wound-deployable cellular therapy advance trauma care burn warrior .</detailed_description>
