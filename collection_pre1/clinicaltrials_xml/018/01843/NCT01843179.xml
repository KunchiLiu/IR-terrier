	<brief_summary>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test effectiveness investigational drug learn whether drug effective treating specific cancer . `` Investigational '' mean sulindac still study research doctor try find . It also mean FDA yet approve use sulindac type cancer . Participants study must undergone previous chemotherapy achieve complete remission , absence disease activity people chronic illness , case AML . Unfortunately , significant number patient AML achieve complete remission initial chemotherapy eventually experience relapse , often within month . Previous research study demonstrate type medication frequently use treat inflammation , call COX inhibitor , may suppress kill leukemia cell . COX inhibitor work block class protein call COX protein . Other commonly use COX inhibitor ibuprofen naproxen . For study , investigator use COX inhibitor call sulindac , FDA approve used treat pain inflammation many year , also study suppress certain tumor gastrointestinal system . The main goal study determine whether sulindac help participant remain state complete remission follow initial course chemotherapy AML , two cycle chemotherapy standard care cancer , call consolidation chemotherapy . During course study , investigator also attempt learn COX inhibition suppress emergence leukemia , molecular cellular level , study participant trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To determine eligible participate study ask undergo screening test procedure . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn take part research study . If test procedure recently , may may repeat . These procedure include medical history , performance status , medical record review , routine blood test , electrocardiogram , echocardiogram research blood sample . If test show eligible participate research study , begin study treatment . If meet eligibility criterion , able participate research study . You begin study two cycle chemotherapy accept approach treatment type leukemia . This call consolidation chemotherapy . If experience severe side effect , may give one cycle . You begin take sulindac complete consolidation therapy . The consolidation therapy commonly use type cancer chemotherapy drug call cytarabine . Each cycle consolidation chemotherapy 28 day , four week . You receive cytarabine via IV infusion Days 1-5 cycle , period 3 hour . You admit MGH approximately week cycle consolidation chemotherapy cytarabine . Before start sulindac , test procedure do screen visit list repeat . This visit `` Day 0 '' , mean take place prior study treatment sulindac . In addition , also sample bone marrow take research purpose . This sample relate study help u understand good activity study drug , sulindac , leukemia cell effect body sulindac . You take sulindac twice day . Sulindac come form tablet take home mouth . Your first day take sulindac call day 1 . The following test procedures one outpatient clinic Day 1 study : Blood sample take 3 point day 1 . These occur first dose sulindac , 1 hour first dose sulindac , 4 hour first dose sulindac . Approximately 3 teaspoon blood drawn time . These sample relate study help u understand good activity study drug , sulindac , leukemia cell effect body sulindac . You come clinic dosing day 2 ( Visit 3 ) study . Approximately 3 teaspoon blood drawn dose . 3 teaspoon blood also draw prior dose day 8 , 15 28 study treatment sulindac . These sample store long research ongoing currently end date . You continue sulindac twice daily duration study , 12 month . You monitor bleeding , since COX inhibitor also decrease platelet function affect clot ability , gastritis ulcer disease , COX inhibitor damage line stomach . These occur minority participant , monitor closely study unexpected effect . If develop toxicity therapy , dose sulindac may reduce symptom severe enough , may take sulindac . If whatever reason unable participate study adhere schedule study treatment , take study treatment discontinue study . You may choose stop treatment come study time . We would like keep track medical condition overall health follow 12 month study treatment study sulindac . This involve communication , occasional review medical record regard medical condition overall health .</detailed_description>
