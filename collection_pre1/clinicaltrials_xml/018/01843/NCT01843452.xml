	<brief_summary>There increase evidence role EGFR , treatment EGFR-inhibitors anal cancer synergy EGFR-inhibitors radiotherapy . Addition human anti-EGFR antibody Panitumumab chemoradiotherapy seem therefore solidly justified . This trial investigate concurrent panitumumab/capecitabine/mitomycin concurrent IMRT-radiotherapy . Treatment component use study select scientific rationale . The trial regimen feasible acceptable toxicity outcome similar historic series .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Concomitant Intensity-modulated Radiotherapy Combined Capecitabine , Mitomycin Panitumumab Patients With Stage II-IIIB Squamous-cell Carcinoma Anal Canal</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES : Primary : -To ass efficacy treatment regimen compose capecitabine , mitomycin , panitumumab , radiotherapy term locoregional control rate patient stage II-IIIB squamous-cell carcinoma anal canal . Secondary : - To assess efficacy regimen base complete response ( CR ) rate , colostomy-free survival , functional colostomy-free survival , overall survival ( OS ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) . - To assess tolerability safety profile regimen . - To assess role PET stag outcome prediction ( patient PET follow local standard ) .</detailed_description>
