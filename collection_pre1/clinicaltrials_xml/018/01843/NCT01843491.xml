	<detailed_description>This open label Phase 1 study Ad-PfCA vaccine design 1 ) provide reagent development refinement cell-mediated immunoassay measure human immune response candidate malaria vaccine ( especially protective malaria vaccine DNA/Ad-PfCA better assay need identify correlate protective immunity ) 2 ) provide repository antigen-specific PBMCs use positive negative control cell mediate immunoassay . The study group consist 35 healthy adult age 18 50 year screen meet inclusion exclusion criterion . Subjects eligible participation regardless baseline adenovirus 5 serostatus . At least 6 subject `` malaria naïve '' , mean 1 ) recipient malaria vaccine , 2 ) history malaria infection travel malaria endemic region within 6 month first leukapheresis procedure 60mL blood draw , 3 ) history long-term residence ( &gt; 5 year ) area know significant transmission P. falciparum , 4 ) negative P. falciparum circumsporozoite ( PfCSP ) ELISpot assay baseline . ( From herein , simplicity , refer PfCSP simply CSP ) . The remain subject restriction regard receipt malaria vaccine , travel history baseline CSP ELISpot result . Although difficult recruit `` malaria-naïve '' subject , inclusion least 6 subject provide varied array immune response ; may helpful assay development . Eligible subject receive single administration Ad-PfCA malaria candidate vaccine dose 2 x 1010 pu intramuscular injection . Approximately 1 month pre-immunization , study subject either large number PBMCs collect mean leukapheresis , simple 60 mL blood draw , dependent upon initial pre-screening . Pre-immunization sample designate repository require large volume sample PBMCs . Rather , 60 mL whole blood draw sufficient repository purpose . Thus , subject separate sub-groups , dependent upon initial pre-screening . Subjects whose sample designate repository undergo simple , 60 mL blood draw lieu leukapheresis # 1 ( sub-group A ) . Samples assign assay development obtain sub-group B . Approximately 1 month post-immunization , study subject sub-groups PBMCs collect mean leukapheresis . Consultation immunology expert post-immunization screen assist identify subject whose sample meet assay development repository need . In effort eliminate unnecessary procedure subject , individual undergo second leukapheresis , return safety visit day 84 . Prior leukapheresis/60 mL blood draw , sample test CSP-ELISpot AMA1 ELISpot ; result use categorize sample ( see ) . Follow visit occur 2 , 7 , 14 , 21 , 84 day follow immunization . Depending guidance FDA , subject follow annually phone , email , mailing five year time immunization per FDA recommendation .</detailed_description>
