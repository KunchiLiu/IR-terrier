	<brief_summary>Background : Due linger effect general anesthesia administration medication pain surgery , child recovery room risk breathe problem . While less data specific child , general 25 % patient recovery room experience complication anesthesia . The common complication involve patient 's airway ability breath adequately . Currently , check oxygenation pulse oximetry monitor respiration nursing assessment use detect breathing problem . However , believe adequate reliably recognize significant respiratory depression dangerous event develop cessation breathing , severe drop oxygen level , cardiac arrest . Capnography monitoring device measure amount carbon dioxide exhale ass adequacy respiration . A small plastic cannula sit base nose lip continuously monitor patient 's breathing . Most child tolerate device well staff consider easy use . While capnography routinely use operating room monitor breathing , use post-operative care patient still risk breathe problem . Objectives : To determine capnography detect problem breathe faster often traditional monitor . To determine addition capnography routine monitoring decrease number additional adverse event occur child undergo post-operative care allow nurse intervene care faster frequently . Methods : In first phase study , investigator apply capnography monitor child recover room determine often experience breathe difficulty measure device . In second phase , investigator educate staff use capnography value consider abnormal . Children capnography cannula place enter recovery room . They divide two group - one group nurse recovery room access capnography monitor patient , whereas group nurse able see readout monitor . The investigator determine child few breathe problem less additional adverse event nurse use capnography addition routine monitor already place recovery room compare nurse use standard monitoring alone . Potential Impact : If capnography detect breathe problem prior identify current monitoring device , staff may able intervene quickly serious event occur child receive post-operative care . This reduce adverse event , improve patient safety , avert harm child . The adoption device routine monitoring post-operative care potential save life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Site : Children enrol post-anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) Yale-New Haven Children 's Hospital , capnography currently utilize . The pediatric PACU 12-bed monitor unit 4-bed perioperative area patient receive one-on-one nursing care . Generally , 20-30 patient care PACU day typical length stay approximately 2 hour . Specific Aim 1b : To determine whether addition capnography lead decrease frequency oxygen desaturations measure pulse oximetry respiratory depression child recover general anesthesia . Study Design Setting : The investigator conduct randomize controlled trial Yale-New Haven Children 's PACU . The identical population , inclusion exclusion criterion recruitment procedure apply . A random number list generate guide recruitment . Investigators blind group designation prior consent enrollment . Study Intervention Data Collection : Prior onset study , PACU nursing staff receive focus training application interpretation capnography . Proper position nasal-oral cannula demonstrate . Capnography waveform review include normal respiratory pattern end-tidal CO2 ( ETCO2 ) level would indicate hypoventilation , apnea obstruction . Staff instruct provide intervention ETCO2 value great 50mmHg less 30mmHg obtain without concomitant increase respiratory rate . Simple noninvasive intervention may include reposition head , instruct patient take several deep breath , physical stimulation , place shoulder roll patient . Invasive intervention may include administration reversal medication , bag-valve mask assist ventilation , insertion oral nasal airway endotracheal intubation . Patients develop oxygen saturation less 93 % may receive increased amount supplemental oxygen discretion treat staff . Patients undergo routine care monitor PACU . As part study , duo-port nasal-oral cannula ETCO2 monitoring place nostril lip patient prior transfer operating room PACU ( Filterline Smart CapnoLine Plus ) attach portable capnography monitor ( Capnostream 20 Bedside Capnography Monitor Oridion ) . Subjects randomized 2 group : responsible nurse physician blind capnography monitor ( control ) , capnography monitor view treating staff recovery period ( case ) . The investigator control group represent current standard care PACU monitoring . Stratified block randomization take place . Patients stratify type surgery : otolaryngology ( ENT ) non-ENT . The randomization sequence place sequentially numbered opaque envelope stratum . Although patient his/her family consent study prior surgery , officially enrolled patient demonstrate he/she tolerate nasal-oral cannula upon arrival PACU . Thus , enrol subject arrives PACU successfully tolerate nasal-oral cannula study envelope contain group designation open research assistant ( RA ) principal investigator ( PI ) study data collection commence . All staff blind group designation time . For case subject , alarm setting program monitor alert provider ETCO2 level 30mmHg 50mmHg . The monitor position easily view treating staff RA/PI study . For control subject , portable capnography monitor position PI RA line sight treat staff . The alarm function turn alert staff abnormal reading monitor . Since investigator mandate staff intervene abnormal ETCO2 value , RA PI participant view capnography monitor control group inform treat staff abnormal value 2 minute length . The Yale Human Investigations committee consult regard ethic withhold information control arm study approve decision . Instances PI RA notify staff event record data form . Methodology : For purpose randomize controlled trial , heart rate , respiratory rate , oxygen saturation routinely monitor record data sheet every 30 second patient PACU PI RA otherwise involve patient care . ETCO2 value record capnography monitor every 30 second waveform continuously capture . These data download capnography monitor time discharge patient . Adverse respiratory event well nurse physician intervention relate airway ventilatory management document PI/RA . These describe previously . Additional pain sedative medication may administer nursing staff record study . Patient disposition total length stay PACU record . The investigator primary outcome frequency The investigator previously define respiratory event occur without use capnography . Sample size calculation : While investigator refine sample size base event rate find first cohort proposal , investigator plan enroll least 200 child pilot study order detect 30 % reduction adverse event rate . Statistical Analysis : Variable distribution first examine descriptive statistic , include box-plots histogram . Any miss data due artifact equipment malfunction explore group . The investigator describe two group patient , blind capnography reading vs. without , term age , gender , ethnicity , type condition sedation require , physician performing procedure . The investigator use Student 's t-test continuous variable chi-square/Fisher 's exact test categorical variable . Statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.05 ) clinically meaningful difference ( 10 % ) two randomize group add multivariate analysis primary outcome . Groups analyze strata - patient receive ENT procedure receive non-ENT procedure . The primary outcome , airway respiratory adverse event , summarize group term number percent patient group experience outcomes . Generalized estimate equation ( GEE ) approach use model probability outcome ( two separate model outcome interest ) randomization group ( blind vs. capnography reading ) main independent predictor . The investigator adjust model important predictor , especially one different two group . Odds ratio ( OR ) surround confidence interval report predictor . The investigator use adjust OR group variable calculate relative risk ( RR ) .37 Significance establish two-tailed alpha=0.05 . The investigator use data obtain funding large , randomize trial also include cost-effectiveness analysis .</detailed_description>
