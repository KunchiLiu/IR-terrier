	<brief_summary>The prevalence diabetes diabetes-associated complication still increase . Several major long-term complication diabetes cardiovascular disease , chronic renal failure , diabetic retinopathy others relate damage blood vessel . Given eye provide unique possibility human body directly visualize blood vessel , much interest direct towards study ocular circulation . Although data large epidemiological study indicate change retinal vessel caliber reflect diabetes related factor , fast glucose level , still conflict evidence blood flow alteration patient diabetes . This also relate fact , methodological difficulty aggravate assessment blood flow change retina large group patient . In present study propose overcome problem use technique call bi-directional Fourier Domain Doppler Optical Coherence Tomography ( FDOCT ) , develop recent year measure retinal blood velocity . This technique allow non-invasive investigation blood flow change human retina help u good understand diabetes relate vascular change . The present study use technique assess retinal blood flow change patient diabetes healthy subject .</brief_summary>
