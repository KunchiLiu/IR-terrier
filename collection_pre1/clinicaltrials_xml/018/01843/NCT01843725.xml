	<brief_title>Phase 1 Study Testing Combination Aflibercept Capecitabine Metastatic Digestive Breast Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aflibercept find active broad pharmacological index early advance stage disease variety preclinical solid tumor model include sarcoma , ovarian , prostate , mammary , colon , gastric carcinoma either single agent combination cytotoxic agent . Metronomic chemotherapy , namely administration continuous low-dose chemotherapy close , regular interval , prolong drug-free interruption , base rationale fact virtually class cancer chemotherapeutic drug design damage DNA disrupt microtubule divide cell . Endothelial cell division take place new blood vessel formation , include tumour angiogenesis . Frequent administration cytotoxic agent low dos think increase putative antiangiogenic activity . This strategy lower toxicity theoretically risk emergence drug-resistant tumour cell compare classic maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) -based chemotherapy .</detailed_description>

Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Signed write inform consent ( approved Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC ) ) obtain prior study specific baseline procedure . Patients malabsorption dysfunctional GI tract . Participants chemotherapy radiotherapy ( except limit radiotherapy bone metastasis instance ) within 4 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . Participants receive experimental agent . Participants know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . History cardiovascular ischemic disease cerebrovascular incident within last six month , NYHA class III IV congestive heart failure .

Major surgery within 6 week . Uncontrolled concurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman , lactation refusal use adequate contraceptive measure ( hormonal barrier method birth control , abstinence ) .</criteria>
