	<brief_summary>Breast cancer survival affect side effect related illness , treatment even behavioral factor ( e.g . inadequate diet , sedentary behavior ) create woman important quantity psychological physical disorder . Prior systematic review meta-analyses demonstrate supervise aerobic training safe , feasible , effective adjunct therapy improve broad range physiological psychological outcome woman early breast cancer . However vast majority study date focus efficacy exercise improve symptom control outcomes breast cancer patient either follow completion adjuvant therapy . Most relevant consequence find woman undergo surgery 16 % 43 % woman breast cancer suffer functional limitation shoulder , inflammation , pain strength flexibility reduction upper body limb one year surgery high prevalence rise . Weight gain associate decreased quality life increase risk several comorbid condition , cardiovascular disease diabetes . The cardiopulmonary problem induce chemotherapy radiotherapy , treatment effect heart consequences cardiorespiratory fitness woman . These side effect become important limitation allow woman return normal life style . These limitation severe effect decrease physical activity practice , visible consequence increase general fatigue calcium deficiency bone due age adjuvant treatment . Previous study find patient breast cancer gain modest amount weight significantly likely experience disease recurrence die breast cancer cause weight stable . In addition , two third study assess body composition change relation weight gain patient population observe net gain muscle mass loss muscle mass body weight adipose tissue increase . These change define sarcopenic obesity . This kind obesity characterize weight gain presence lean tissue loss absence lean tissue gain . In addition fat tissue gain related health disorder diabetes , functional limitation poor survival level . Treatment unique pattern weight gain exercise intervention , especially strength training . Psychological effect take account cancer produce important aftermath . Large scientific evidence show psycho-emotional alteration woman diagnose breast cancer point life . World Health Organization ( WHO ) define quality life `` individual perception position life context culture value system live relation goal , expectation , standard concern . It broad range concept affect complex way person 's physical health , psychological state , level independence , social relationship , personal belief relationship salient feature environment . '' Following definition number research develop , present interest physiological psychological change improvement , show different study . HYPOTHESIS The primary hypothesis study group exercise intervention , combine aerobic strength training , reduce lean mass body fat tissue breast cancer post treatment survival . Secondary hypothesis clinical trial follow : 1 . Combined exercise intervention increase maximal strength level chest press leg press . 2 . Combined exercise intervention increase maximal cardiopulmonary capacity , assess Peak Oxygen Consumption ( VO2peak ) , confirm important value survival . In addition , ACSM propose value Gold Standard ass fitness level . 3 . Combined exercise intervention increase global Isometric Strength Index , assess Grip Strength Dynamometer . 4 . Combined exercise intervention improve range motion upper-limbs . 5 . Patients Reported Outcomes ( PROs ) , quality life ( QoL ) , Health perception depression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study 3-month , two arm , randomize control exercise intervention trial , develop . After baseline measurement , participant randomize treatment control group use blocked randomization procedure . This study develop collaboration Technical University Madrid ( UPM ) Cancer Patients Spanish Group ( GEPAC ) . This project carry facility Physical Activity Sport Science ( FCCAFD-INEF ) approve Ethical Committee UPM . Women recruit hospital poster oncologist information diffusion project GEPAC member . Women present interest contact phone mail study flyer ask fill initial questionnaire The intervention perform social framework . It try provide different skill woman , order improve self-trust self-knowledge . Other important goal give woman space share experience help woman go situation . The exercise program design conduct qualified Physical Activity Sport Sciences . The exercise program consist combine two day per week supervise train program one day per week briskly walking , follow document , design specialist trainer , give begin program . The intervention duration 12 consecutive week . The intensity increase progressively 65 % 85 % heart rate . The intensity control heart rate monitor trademark POLAR FT7 . Prescription intensity do use Karvonen equation , recommend method work risk population . Every supervised session structure duration 60 minute . American College Sport Medicine ( ACSM ) Guidelines Cancer Patients follow session design . Participants divide group 15 per class provide individual attendance . The first 10 minute warm include joint mobilization , different kind movement , briskly walk run . Next part consist aerobic exercise principal goal practice activity increase cardiopulmonary fitness functional capacity participant . Practiced activity `` impact activity '' activity weight support leg . They activate bone regeneration prevent osteoporosis . Interval training perform part , 30 second high intensity 3 minute active recovery . Then , strength exercise elastic band activity woman support weight develop improve general strength increase lean mass . The intensity quantify number repetition ( 8 15 ) set ( 2 3 ) . The last part stretch exercise dedicate improve joint mobility muscle flexibility upper body limbs general muscle relax train . Women contact 3 month project know real effect adherence participant global strength . All adverse event could occur intervention time register project coordinator contact phone patient . These outcome assess baseline repeat 12 week . Lean body mass fat body mass Percentage fat mass percentage muscle ma assess bio impedance , use TANITA BC-601F machine . Demographics clinical data Age , marital status , profession , quantity physical activity disease , subtype tumor , type resection type endocrine medication record baseline measurement . Anthropometric assessment Weight , high , hip waist circumference waist-hips ratio . Arm volumetries do check arm swell increase . Strength It assessed use two type assessment . First type grip strength hand , legs back . Global strength assess Strength Index , obtain add grip strength value divide de result participant weight . Grip Strength dynamomyter T.K.K.5401 arm strength T.K.K.5402 legs back strength use . Other study use method order obtain strength level breast cancer woman demonstrate feasible safe method population . Second type strength test 8 RM protocol predict 1 Repetition Maximum ( RM ) , follow National Strength Conditioning Association guideline ( NCSA 2008 ) Mayhew formula use predict 1 RM . Test develop PANATA machine . Cardiovascular Capacity . It assess submaximal cardiopulmonary exercise test follow Prior start , woman complete PAR-Q test determine whether able perform grade exercise test . Cardio-respiratory exercise response assess participant use graded exercise test ( GXT ) treadmill . The test modification Bruce GXT design use clinical older population since submaximal portion test do walking begin reduce intensity . The ACSM guideline performance Cardio Pulmonary Exercise Test ( CPET ) follow develop stop , necessary . Patient Report Outcomes Quality Life It important outcome large definition relate different concept physical psychological health , individual independence social relationship . It assess FACT-B questionnaire suggest review use population . The questionnaire present 38 item patient choose 5 option ( 0 totally disagree 4 totally agree ) describe grade accordance specific item Depression Grade depression assess Center Epidemiology Studies - Depression ( CES.D ) . It use previous study order determine outcome breast cancer population . This test Likert scale , present 20 item . Patient identify many time felt way previous week ( 0 never 3 always ) . A score equal 16 regard mild depressive disorder Health Survey Short Form -36 Health Survey ( SF-36 ) test use ass Health Survey . Health status score abstraction , obtain mean knowledge score related variable already use cancer patient population . It present 36 item divide 7 dimension interpret together separately . Physical Activity Adherence physical activity woman practice program collect validate questionnaire Godin Leisure-Time Test register time per week intensity activity woman usually typical week . All statistical analysis do use SPSS Statistics 20.0 program . Confidential interval 95 % significance value 0.05 determine significance result . Baseline characteristic participant across intervention control group compare use Student t-test continuous outcome . Between woman comparison randomize treatment versus control change FACT-B , FACT-F , SF-36 CES-D , score across month 0-3 make use Student t-test , determine adjustment potential confounders alter result . Confounders examine include postmenopausal status , BMI status , baseline level sport leisure-time physical activity . Pearson correlation coefficient use evaluate association change body composition strength cardio-pulmonary status change PROs score . All probability value test 2-tailed test . Follow 4 month intervention compare baseline post intervention measure use ANOVA test .</detailed_description>
