	<detailed_description>Research Design Methods : This study utilize multi-phase mixed-methods approach develop test patient inventory facilitate patient-centered care delivery . In Phase I investigators identify factor consider inclusion patient inventory . This involve interview focus group provider patient , respectively ; review relevant literature . In Phase II investigator develop test inventory use Delphi panel assemble questionnaire repository . In Phase III investigator conduct randomize trial compare patient inventory control condition ( e.g. , healthy living video ) ass whether use inventory result care patient-centered decision collaborative . Phase I : To identify patient contextual factor preference , patient ' experience , awareness , resource , willingness use technology care delivery , investigator conduct focus group patient 2 facility 4 CBOCs Veterans Integrated Service Network 12 ( VISN 12 ) represent urban rural setting mix sociodemographic characteristic . In order capture perspective Veterans live rural area may represent broad range socio-demographic characteristic , investigator conduct focus group four CBOCs associate medical facility represent urban/rural ethnic diversity . The investigator plan recruit patient receive care technology ( e.g. , home telehealth ( HT ) , CVT ) little experience care deliver technology . The investigator conduct separate focus group patient receive care technology use technology health care . Focus group discussion transcribe verbatim analyze use constant comparative technique code data thematically . This information serve foundation develop inventory . A total 8-12 focus group conduct 5-8 Veteran participant per group ( n=40 96 patient ) . The investigator conduct 2 focus group VA facility , 1-2 focus group CBOC . Based prior experience conduct focus group Veterans , investigator believe number focus group provide sufficient data reach saturation , point new information uncover group discussion . Two member research team manage focus group . Patient Focus Group Questions . A discussion guide include open-ended item probes follow-up question use conduct focus group patient . The guide consist question design generate discussion among participant concern contextual factor , patient-centered care , technology use health care delivery . The first set question assist identify contextual factor affect patient ' ability manage care . The second set question explore patient ' understanding preference patient-centered care . The final set question describe patient ' awareness , available resource , willingness use health technology . Data analyze use constant comparative technique consistent grounded-theory approach Provider Interviews . Semi-structured interview conduct healthcare provider site . Providers consist PACT and/or primary care team member include nurse care manager physician . The investigator use semi-structured interview provider add flexibility afford method respect time schedule . The investigator develop semi-structured interview guide address research objective . The first set question design identify contextual factor understand provider attempt address . Data analyze use process detailed analysis focus group data ( i.e. , constant comparative technique consistent ground theory ) . Question Repository . In parallel focus group interview , investigator ' research assistant review available literature PubMed , psycINFO reference search engines surveys/questionnaires include item related area patient context . Initial search term include : assessment tool , assessment scale , risk assessment , contextual factor , patient questionnaire context specific term technology resource , social support patient-centered care . The investigator assemble repository question could use investigator ' inventory . If contextual area investigator unable find adequate question , investigator generate item consideration Delphi panel . Phase II : Creating Patient Inventory . Using findings focus group , information literature , input expert panel investigator draft patient inventory serve collaborative decision tool patient provider . The investigator work expert panel identify refine content area inventory use modify Delphi panel approach . The goal project develop instrument would take 10-15 minute patient complete . Participants/procedures . A heterogeneous panel choose base participant ' willingness participate knowledge relevant topic . Because patient key stakeholder patient-centered care , investigator assemble panel include Veteran representative , VA provider , researcher representative investigator ' operation partner . To maintain least 14 respondent ( 70 % ) , investigator initially recruit 20 panelist ( 5 stakeholder group ) . The investigator conduct Delphi process series email exchange . In first email round , list possible item context area distribute . Panelists ask rank importance area context identify , comment whether feel redundancy category , provide input relevance item within content area patient context , patient-centered care and/or collaborative decision-making . The investigator also ask open-ended question allow panel member identify area feel include . Responses enter without identification panelist . Each participant assign ID code . Categories item panelist agree fit redundant item well word , item rank low drop . A revised set category item send panelist second round review . At time , panelists repeat process use first round review . A final draft send panel one review . The investigator also include feedback qualitative comment make panelist round data specific item rating ( e.g. , median , low high rating per item , etc . ) The response last review use finalize patient inventory . The investigator anticipate process take approximately 4-5 month complete Inventory Template . Once patient inventory finalize , investigator integrate iPad application patient use . The iPad provide multiple advantage collect patient information , provide portable , touch-driven multimedia experience popular across different demographic stratum . The iPad inventory include skip pattern respondent jump non-relevant item , out-of-range checking validation respondent enter erroneous information , drop-down box , utilize example explanation clarity . Patients opportunity `` answer '' item , base personal comfort information share . The investigator perform iterative test iPad version inventory ensure acceptability patient . All information enter iPad kept private secure , patient access store data . As additional safeguard , iPad `` time '' use duration time prevent extraneous view others . The iPad use wait area patient prior encounter health care provider . Research staff maintain iPad , include charging , store securely use prevent theft , apply anti-bacterial cleaner , monitor device use . When patient use iPad inventory , application create brief report summarize patient preference contextual factor . This report available PACT point care facilitate patient/provider communication collaborative decision-making . For initial study , research staff facilitate communication report health care provider generate paper summary patient hand provider . However , design test consider future implementation strategy , include incorporation clinical workflow pattern adoption clinical staff . Phase III : Testing Patient Inventory . The investigator plan pilot patient inventory sample Veterans two set PACT clinic ; one Hines JBVA . The study design randomize controlled trial . The investigator randomize half patient complete patient inventory half control condition ( i.e. , health video ) . The investigator stratify Veterans Affairs Medical Center ( VAMC ) ensure equal sample . The randomization scheme develop use computer generate random assignment . Eligible patient identify recruit PACT clinic Hines Jesse Brown VAMCs . No subject exclude base gender , race , ethnicity . Eligibility criterion include : ( 1 ) adult , age 18 ; ( 2 ) assign primary care provider PACT clinic ; ( 3 ) history dementia ; ( 4 ) blindness ( unable view iPad app ) . Only patient participate provider eligible study , ensure patient provider consent audio-recordings study procedure . It possible provider discern visit patient involve use 'summary ' form visit audio-recorded . To address likelihood Hawthorne effect follow strategy undertaken . First , provider inform visit record include patient provide additional write information provider visit include information . Second , investigator undertake sensitivity analysis compare data first 10 % audio-recorded encounter 2nd 5th 10 % encounter . The investigator ass whether provider behavior significantly different point time . If first several visit result different behavior later visit , investigator eliminate first recording analysis . Thus , investigator over-recruit patient 10 % , patient evenly distribute intervention control arm . Intervention : The patient inventory develop focus group Delphi panel serve intervention . The inventory deploy use iPad . Patients provide copy summary provider begin visit . Control Condition . To address concern Hawthorne effect , investigator implement attention control . The control group use iPad view brief health video ( e.g. , 8-10 minute ) contain general health information . The VA National Center Health Promotion Disease Prevention ( NCP ) currently develop set video-based health living message . The investigator utilize one video control group . Alternatively , Agency Healthcare Research Quality ( AHRQ ) develop several video available cost 508 compliant . The 'Be involve health care - Questions answer ' 7 minute video focus talk provider ask question ( http : //www.ahr.gov/questions/video/waitroom/ ) . Control patient also ask audio-record encounter provider , reveal . Patients complete informed consent process , agree use iPad either complete inventory view video health , willingness encounter provider audio record , completion set questionnaire follow clinic visit . Consenting patient complete patient inventory view video iPad prior clinic visit . A research assistant instruct patient use iPad patient need complete questionnaire ( intervention condition ) . The RA available answer question provide additional instruction , need . After intervention patient complete questionnaire , RA hook iPad portable printer hard copy inventory generate patient immediately give provider . The patient proceed his/her visit provider . To ensure adequate use iPad patient inventory , RA available assist subject use necessary . The research team collect information frequently assistance need , form support provide . The investigator estimate inventory take approximately 10-15 minute complete . Patients opportunity complete inventory designate , private area reduce interruption distraction . In intervention control arm , patient ask conceal small record device pocket and/or bag order record conversation provider . The patient tell provider agree record patient visit provider know visit record . The RA turn device hand patient patient return recorder visit . Weiner successfully utilized strategy two HSR &amp; D fund study . Following clinic visit , patient ask complete set questionnaire . These item complete use paper pencil . The investigator also ask patient indicate whether use technology health care use checklist ( use home telehealth , CVT , secure messaging , prescription refill HealtheVet [ MHV ] , use mobile apps like PTSD coach , access VA Facebook twitter site ) whether future care plan include use technology . Providers . PACT provider also serve research subject study . The investigator ask provider consent encounter record one year period . The investigator explain provider interested examine effect provide provide additional patient-generated information provider time visit patient/provider interaction . Providers assure identifiable information record transcription ( e.g. , provider refer unique study ID number ) . The investigator also ask provider participate debrief interview end study ask value use pre-visit patient inventory encounter patient . Only patient provider consent participate approach study participation . Study Measures : To determine patient-centeredness investigator ask patient tell experience care extent care receive met preference address contextual factor . The investigator utilize measure patient-centeredness include Consultation Relational Empathy ( CARE ) measure Consultation Care Measure ( CCM ) . To objectively evaluate extent care provide patient-centered , investigator obtain audiotape patient/provider encounter code use Weiner 's 4C analysis measure Informed Decision Making ( IDM ) tool evaluate collaborative decision make patient/provider encounter . These measure describe : CARE . The Consultation Relational Empathy ( CARE ) Measure process measure empathy holistic care context therapeutic relationship . Mercer define empathy medical encounter ability provider understand patient 's situation , perspective feeling ; communicate patient understand check whether s/he correct interpretation , act way helpful therapeutic .This description fit many definition patient-centered care . The CARE measure 10 item specifically ask today 's consultation . To good fit definition care US , investigator change word consultation 'visit . ' For item , respondent rate response poor , fair , good , good , excellent , apply . Questions include : How provider 'making feel ease ' , 'letting tell `` story '' ' , 'being positive . ' The score item add maximum score 50 minimum 10 ; high score reflect great 'patient-centeredness ' . CCM . The Consultation Care Measure ( CCM ) measure patient 's perception patient-centered care last visit provider . There 5 subscales 21-item scale . CCM assess communication partnership ( 11 item ) , personal relationship ( 3 item ) , health promotion ( 2 item ) , positive clear approach problem ( 3 item ) , interest effect life ( 2 item ) . The item use 4-point Likert scale score 1= strongly agree 2= strongly agree 3=agree 4=neutral/disagree . Cronbach 's reliability range 0.84 0.96 subscales . A high level patient-centeredness base CCM ( low score ) associate short-term good health outcome . Informed Decision Making ( IDM ) measure extent decision make involve patient provider include 7 element complete decision . The 7 element include : discussion patient 's role decision making , clinic issue nature decision , alternative , pro con ( benefit risk ) , uncertainty , patient understanding , patient preference . For decision , score 0-7 assign base review audio-recorded encounter . A high score expect decision complex ( decision categorize basic , intermediate complex ) . For basic decision ( e.g. , refill medication ) , score 2-3 would indicate good IDM event , intermediate decision ( e.g. , prescribe use new piece equipment - CPAP ) result score 5-6 reflect informed decision ; complex decision ( e.g. , lifestyle counseling ) would receive score 7 element IDM note decision . Content Coding Contextualizing Care ( 4C ) . The 4C analysis methodology assess patient center clinical decision making . Specifically , 4C rate encounter base whether provider ( ) probe clinically relevant context ( b ) plan care accordingly . The analysis generate patient 's medical record audio record provider-patient visit . 4C may conduct two individual many five , additional personnel require verify inter-rater reliability source evidence validity . Coding do experienced coder work Dr. Weiner two prior study utilize 4C analysis . Sample size/power : The primary measure patient-centered care CARE measure . Normative data CARE indicate mean score 40.8 ( range 10-50 ) between-physician variance patient receive care physician , = 9.0247 , within-patient variance = 69.2149 , total variance = 78.2396 ( SD=8.85 ) ( Mercer 2005 ) . Without take account related patient CARE score patient treated physician , 64 patient control intervention group ( total n=128 ) adequate detect moderate effect size ( Cohen 's d=0.5 ) 0.05 level 0.8 power . Of course , patient receive care physician might respond similarly question regard empathy holistic care pertain physician , record CARE measure . The multiplicative effect standard error due cluster 1 + ( m-1 ) *ICC , represent size cluster ( patient per physician ) ICC intraclass correlation same-physician patient CARE outcomes . 25 doctor 11 patient , 24 doctor 12 patient sufficient detect moderate effect size ( Cohen 's d=0.5 ) 0.05 level 0.8 power . Accounting possibility patient may change mind , fatigue , and/or enough time complete post-visit question , deficiency physician attrition , investigator add additional 10 % ( 28 patients/25-26 physician ) total . The total study sample size 25-26 provider 300-308 ; 150-154 patient per group . Patients enrol PACT clinic Hines Jesse Brown serve patient subject pool provider PACT team serve provider subject . Only patient panels provider consent participate recruit study . Analysis : Descriptive statistic include frequency mean calculated characterize investigator ' patient sample , include demographic ( e.g. , mean age , gender , ethnicity/race ) . The investigator utilize t-tests make comparison intervention comparison group patient measure . The overall score subscale score CARE CCM compare use t-tests . They examine extent characteristic include study site ( Hines , JBVA ) patient characteristic ( age , race ) account difference rating patient-centered care use linear regression model . The investigator use standard formula Y = + b1X + b2X + . biX , 15 covariates ( use 1 covariate every 10 observation ) addition intervention effect ( b1 ) . As many patient may provider , could effect provider . They explore use multi-level modeling account provider effect . 4C Coding Analysis . 4C analysis rate encounter base whether provider probe clinically relevant context plan care accordingly . The analysis use patient 's medical record audio- record provider-patient visit . 4C cod include following : 1 . Contextual red flag identification : Following encounter , first step coder determine contextual red flag provider would need explored provide appropriate care . Red flag include thing like missed appointment , non-adherence medication receipt laboratory test deterioration chronic illness ( e.g. , uncontrolled blood pressure ) . A contextual red flag define anything patient say observe situation behavior suggest contextual factor address may contribute problem care . The search contextual red flag begin structured medical record review contextual red flag `` screener '' . If flag find medical record coder listen audio-recording determine patient make statement suggest underlie contextual issue essential care . For example : a. Contextual red flag identify chart review : Rising systolic blood pressure patient hypertension previously well control . b. Contextual red flag identify audio-recording : Visually impaired Veteran hypertension mention daughter , set medication daily pill box , relocate another city job . 2 . Coder ( ) formulate unambiguous direct probe red flag : The coder ( ) compose unambiguous provider probe identify contextual red flag , e.g . `` I notice hypertension use well control blood pressure high last couple month . What think go life might factor problem ? '' The probe always form question provider response red flag . The purpose exercise help coder identify s/he listen indicate provider notice pursue contextual red flag . 3 . Coder listen clinician probe : The coder listen whether provider pursue contextual red flag manner substantively approximate direct probe . 4 . Coder listen 'patient reveal ' response probe : If provider probed , coder determines whether patient reveal contextual information relevant care , `` It 's lot difficult remember take medication I 'm suppose since daughter leave . '' 5 . Coder formulates unambiguous direct response patient reveal : If patient reveals contextual issue response probe , coder formulates unambiguous response reveal indicate provider recognize need contextualize care plan , e.g . `` Let 's talk could change medication schedule help remember . '' 6 . Coder listen contextualization care plan : The coder listen whether provider recommend plan care substantively approximate direct probe . ( e.g. , switches medication morning ) Because cod quite nuanced , Weiner et al . develop comprehensive training manual , similar develop cod system , Debra Roter 's `` Roter Interaction Analysis System '' ( RIAS ) , utilized cod physician patient communication . RIAS cod interactional process behavior ( e.g . clinician patient ask open v close ended question , give instruction , ask understanding , paraphrase , etc . ) content . The 4C cod manual available Dr. Weiner , co-inv study . ( http : //dvn.iq.harvard.edu/dvn/dv/4C ) IDM Analysis . Reliability cod three coder establish least 85 % concurrence coder individually code encounter . The investigator recheck reliability every 25 encounter coder code encounter ensure cod similar manner . If concurrence 75 % , investigator review cod criterion re-establish concurrence use next 2-3 audiotaped encounter . Coders listen audiotapes identify number type decision occur encounter . Then select decision interest/concern patient code decision use IDM criterion . The investigator compare mean IDM score decision type intervention vs. control group determine whether use inventory facilitates informed decision make Cost impact : In study , investigator conduct cost-identification analysis ass cost provide intervention study . Additionally , conduct budget impact analysis assess impact cost VA medical center implement patient inventory . The cost intervention include cost equipment need intervention ( i.e. , iPad printer ) cost change clinic personnel time result intervention . The patient inventory may impact clinic personnel 's time due need train assist patient enter inventory well potentially change duration clinic visit due discussion facilitate patient inventory . The RA record 1 ) time take train patient use iPad , 2 ) time take patient complete patient inventory proportion time RA spend assist patient , 3 ) time take print inventory patient give provider . Additionally , RA record whether interferes time clinic visit . The RA also record length provider/patient encounter record time provider enter clinic room see patient leaf room/completes visit . In order make comparison usual care , RA also record length time usual encounter time encounter control patient randomize . The investigator also conduct budget impact analysis evaluate cost implement intervention VA medical center . The estimated budget impact medical center sum purchase price equipment , cost clerical personnel 's time , cost physician ' time ( estimate average physician 's wage multiply difference average time clinic visit intervention control patient ) . The investigator estimate total cost provide intervention patient alternative scenario regard number patient would complete inventory amount equipment would need purchase .</detailed_description>
