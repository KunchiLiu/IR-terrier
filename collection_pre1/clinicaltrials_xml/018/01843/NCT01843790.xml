	<brief_summary>The primary objective study compare change estimate glomerular filtration rate ( eGFR ) baseline Week 8 placebo GCS-100 treatment . The secondary objective determine safety tolerability GCS-100 administer 8 week relative placebo . In addition , study measure effect GCS-100 circulate galectin-3 marker disease activity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase 2a Study Weekly Doses GCS-100 Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Galectin-3 contributes fibrosis , elevate patient ESRD , correlate adverse outcome ( de Boer et . al. , 2011 , Dang et . al. , 2012 , Fernandes Bertocchi et . al. , 2008 , Henderson et . al. , 2008 ) . Animal model genetic knockout galectin-3 demonstrate reduction structural functional deficit kidney ( Dang et . al. , 2012 , Fernandes Bertocchi et . al. , 2008 , Henderson et . al. , 2008 ) . GCS-100 galectin- 3 antagonist show reduce fibrosis pre-clinically . Based role galectin-3 fibrosis kidney disease , Sponsor believe GCS-100 may effective treat patient CKD .</detailed_description>
