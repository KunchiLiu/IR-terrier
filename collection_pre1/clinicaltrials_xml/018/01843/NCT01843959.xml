	<detailed_description>Obesity Type 2 diabetes ( T2DM ) regard global epidemic develop country recently develop nation . Obesity ( T2DM risk factor ) T2DM present significant health risk individual disease substantial risk individual complication ( Deepa Nath , 2006 ) . The UAE USA similar prevalence obesity , 36 % 35.7 % respectively . Interestingly , percentage population T2DM two group differs significantly , 25 % 8.7 % respectively . The rate T2DM Emirati population 2.9 fold high US . This suggest alter inter relationship obesity T2DM . One hypothesis could explain variation difference body metabolism central adiposity two population . This assess measure cardiometabolic risk factor , central adiposity metabolomics . Analysis metabolomic profile may help define risk factor associate diabetes difference metabolic activity various ethnicity . Another area ample interest advance glycation end-products ( AGEs ) metabolic pathway ( Pietropaoli D , 2012 ) . AGEs form increased rate diabetes number detrimental effect retinopathy , nephropathy atherosclerosis ( Melpomeni Peppa , 2003 ) . As , determine core mechanism result metabolic cardiovascular dysfunction aid identify develop therapeutic target , may turn alleviate deleterious effect respective disorder diabetes . The aetiology diabetes complex . However , adenovirus 36 show play significant role obesity diabetes . As , analysis ADV-36 occurrence within Emirati population may provide insight novel obesity diabetes risk factor could clarify relationship obesity T2DM . This study may provide evidence clarifies obesity result T2DM , occurrence predominant Emirati population . In addition , assessment AGEs within population , range people diabetes obesity healthy individual , may provide insight potential therapeutic target , thereby improve overall heath population . Finally , data may improve knowledge new risk factor ADV-36 subsequent effect diabetes .</detailed_description>
