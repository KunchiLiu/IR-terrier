	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study image-guided adaptive radiotherapy detect tumor treatment patient head neck cancer . Image-guided adaptive radiotherapy use high quality image technology detect tumor normal organ treatment . It yet know imaging technique provide best image guidance treatment radiation therapy . Comparing result image procedure do , , radiotherapy may help doctor plan best treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>I . To conduct clinical imaging study utilize three novel in-room image system : Oblique Brainlab ExacTrac image , Orthogonal Varian kilovoltage ( kV ) On-board Imaging ( OBI ) image , Varian cone-beam compute tomography ( CBCT ) image assess performance reduce inter- intrafractional setup error , relative weekly megavoltage ( MV ) electronic portal imaging device ( EPID ) image , use bony landmark soft tissue change head neck cancer ( HNC ) patient undergoing external beam radiation therapy ( RT ) . II . To assess accuracy CBCT image measure systematic soft tissue change head neck ( HN ) area relative conventional high resolution contrast enhance fan-beam compute tomography ( CT ) ( FBCT ) standard . III . To assess systematic random soft tissue motion error use daily CBCT image relative bony-landmark alignment evaluate benefit soft tissue image radiotherapy . IV . To quantify soft tissue change entire course radiotherapy ( e.g . tumor shrinkage ) use daily CBCT imaging . V. To determine feasibility use measure set soft-tissue motion uncertainty conjunction volume change observe serial CBCT image , offline adaptive replanning HNC patient use available planning tool . VI . To quantify benefit adaptive image-guided radiotherapy ( IGRT ) HN patient term target coverage normal tissue avoidance . VII . To determine feasibility mount phase I/II trial ass clinical benefit image-guided adaptive radiotherapy ( IGART ) term acute late toxicity tumor control . VIII . To build HNC patient database future validation IGART process use deformable image registration Virtual Clinical Trials ( VCTs ) . OUTLINE : Patients undergo FBCT treatment weekly total 6-7 scan , dual CBCT 5 time weekly total 33-35 scan , 2-dimensional ( 2-D ) x-ray Varian kV OBI 5 time weekly total 33-35 scan , 2-D x-ray Brain Lab ExacTrac 5 time weekly total 33-35 scan , 2-D x-ray Varian MV OBI weekly total 6-7 scan , EPID image 5 time weekly total 33-35 scan undergoing IGART .</detailed_description>
