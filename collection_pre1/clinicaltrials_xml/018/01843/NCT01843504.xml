	<brief_summary>The goal study find effective treatment chronic patellar tendinopathy ( PT ) . Investigators conduct 32-week randomize controlled clinical trial determine whether platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) injection improve disease-specific clinical outcome correlation new method ultrasound ( US ) image assessment call Acoustoelastography ( AE ) . Positive finding PRP compare control would suggest future large scale study help establish optimal protocol nonsurgical management PT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Platelet-Rich Plasma ( PRP ) Injection Treatment Chronic Patellar Tendinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomize , single-blinded control trial . Adult subject , age 18-65 chronic patellar tendinopathy ( PT ) , recruit University Wisconsin ( UW ) Sports Medicine Clinics UW Physical Therapy Clinics . 44 subject randomize one two study arm ( 22 group ) . Subjects assessor blind subject group allocation . Subjects Group 1 ( PRP ) receive single US-guided injection 5 mL autologous platelet-rich plasma week 0 ( baseline ) . Subjects Group 2 ( saline control ) receive single injection 5 mL 0.9 % normal saline week 0 . Subjects group receive one session injection . Subjects invited participate study ask undergo knee evaluation examination . Tender area associate patellar tendon identify . This exam occur US Sports Medicine Clinic Research Park . If patient see PI routine clinic visit knee pain , patient may identify potential research participant . During clinic visit , patient undergo knee evaluation examination . If patient confirm patellar tendinopathy , PI introduce study . If interested , PI conduct brief in-person interview determine eligibility via self-reported inclusion exclusion criterion . Subjects qualify write consent obtain prior knee exam . Subjects report WIMR ultrasound-guided procedure follow-up diagnostic imaging conduct . The study coordinator greet subject , remind detail study procedure , potential benefit risk , answer question . Dr. Lee meet subject , answer question assess vital sign . The RN prepare 3 mL syringe 1 % lidocaine 30G , Â½ '' long needle pre-injection topical analgesia ( skin wheal ) . The RN perform blood draw 15 mL subject 's blood antecubital fossa elbow use 20 mL syringe 18G needle . There side preference . Control subject also undergo phlebotomy maintain blinding . This small amount blood ; Red Cross donations one unit whole blood typically 450 mL . The study coordinator place sample Platelet Separator System ( centrifuge ) spin blood sample use two-stage spinning : 1st separate red blood cell platelet , 2nd concentrate platelet . This spun centrifuge yield 6 mL concentrate autologous platelet . All blood equipment handle follow universal precaution . Ultrasound serve visual guidance injection . Dr. Lee perform ultrasound-guided injection . The injection technique identical subject two injection group . The skin cleanse chloraprep . Lidocaine skin wheal place local analgesia . The origin patellar tendon affect knee identify use ultrasound12MHz linear array transducer . Under continuous ultrasound evaluation , 1.0-2.0 mL prepare PRP saline solution inject onto origin patella tendon use 22G , 1.5 '' long needle . Then , 3.0 4.0 mL PRP saline solution pepper along short segment tendon area palpate tenderness US-documented pathology . Ultrasound guide PRP injection follow-up ultrasound perform WIMR 's Ultrasound Imaging Research Lab . The WIMR Ultrasound research program provide equipment ( Siemens S2000 ) , linear array probe , supply injection . The WIMR Ultrasound research program provide research sonographer ( Sarah Kohn ) . This important maintaining consistency image protocol , image acquisition , subject satisfaction , also influence outcome research study . After injection , subject rest 5 minute study coordinator obtain subject 's vital sign . Subjects ask complete outcome questionnaire . Participants give 20 tablet 500mg acetaminophen `` as-needed '' analgesia telephone 2 day enquire side effect adverse event outcome assessment procedure . The platelet concentration analyze sample ( whole blood compare PRP ) order verify concentration factor PRP . Platelet count whole blood vary individual . The optimal quantity platelet growth factor require tissue heal know , clinically effective concentration describe great 4 time baseline autologous whole blood platelet concentration . Therefore , platelet concentration yield may important implication clinical outcome correlation . Following procedure , approximately 1 mL autologous whole blood 1 mL unused PRP analyze use standard lab automate analyzer , Horiba ABX Micros 60 hematology cytometer , UW Health Research Park Clinic . Subjects complete outcome questionnaire week 0 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 32 week . The questionnaire week 4 , 8 , 12 16 , along self-addressed stamp envelope provide study participant time enrollment study folder . Questionnaires return time indicate due date top questionnaire . If subject return questionnaire , member study team contact subject phone reminder , participant invite complete survey phone . Ultrasound image perform baseline 32 week . On final visit , participant report schedule visit WIMR clinic 32 week ultrasound visit . Subjects complete 32 week questionnaire time subject already do .</detailed_description>
