	<brief_summary>Kidney transplant recipient usually lose graft rejection immunosuppressive drug toxicity . In kidney transplantation , calcineurin-inhibitors ( include cyclosporine A ) widely use . Their renal toxicity could divide acute toxicity ( toxic arteriolopathy toxic tubulopathy ) chronic toxicity ( hyaline arteriolopathy , interstitial fibrosis , tubular atrophy glomerulosclerosis ) . Several animal model show implication mineralocorticoid receptor ( MR ) activation toxic phenomenon . The use mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist useful regard renal function kidney histological damage . Several antagonist available France none indicate kidney transplantation . Eplerenone appear selective molecule mineralocorticoid receptor less adverse anti-androgenic effect others molecule . Its principal adverse event hyperkalemia orthostatic hypotension . Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist , especially eplerenone , could useful prevention nephrotoxicity induce calcineurin-inhibitors . Classically , eplerenone contra-indicated patient present impaired renal function , determine creatinine clearance 50mL/min . Moreover , France , warn especially notify association cyclosporine A due fact study do context . The investigator study first safety use eplerenone association cyclosporine A kidney transplant recipient . Then , safe , investigator study efficiency large randomize controlled trial .</brief_summary>
