	<brief_title>Uterine Artery Embolization ( UAE ) Versus High-Intensity-Focused-Ultrasound ( HIFU ) Treatment Uterine Fibroids</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The usual management symptomatic uterine fibroid surgery ( myomectomy hysterectomy ) , current study , uterine artery embolization ( UAE ) form non-surgical minimally invasive treatment , High-Intensity-Focused-Ultrasound ( HIFU ) form non-invasive treatment complete out-patient within hour . Embolization cause ischaemia shrinkage fibroid therefore symptomatic relieve . HIFU medical technology use cancer treatment . Energy deliver outside body non-invasive manner produce heat energy cause necrosis shrinkage uterine fibroid thereby relieve symptom due fibroid . It involve radiation . The clinical effectiveness HIFU uterine fibroid unknown , however , base knowledge clinical effectiveness HIFU liver cancer pancreatic cancer , reasonable ground believe HIFU effective uterine fibroid .</detailed_description>
