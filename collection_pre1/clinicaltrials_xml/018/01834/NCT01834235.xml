	<detailed_description>During Part 1 study , safe tolerable dose NPC-1C combination Gemcitabine determine . Upon completion phase I study 90 patient randomized one two arm : A : Patients receive NPC-1C ( NEO-102 ) infusion dose 1.5mg/kg IV nab-paclitaxel ( 125 mg/m2 30 minute infusion , maximum infusion time exceed 40 minute ) follow gemcitabine ( 1000 mg/m2 30 minute infusion ) 3 consecutive week ( Day 1 , 7 15 ) follow week rest ( 28 day cycle ) . OR B : Patients receive Day 1 , 7 15 nab-paclitaxel ( 125 mg/m2 30 minute infusion , maximum infusion time exceed 40 minute ) follow gemcitabine ( 1000 mg/m2 30 minute infusion ) 3 consecutive week ( Day 1 , 7 15 ) . NPC-1C ( NEO-102 ) infusion dose 1.5mg/kg IV 30 minute follow completion gemcitabine day 1 15 28 day cycle .</detailed_description>
