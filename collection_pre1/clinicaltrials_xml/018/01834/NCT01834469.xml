	<brief_title>Imaging Peritoneal Carcinomatosis From Ovarian Carcinoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective : Evaluation ability NIR image image detect `` viable `` gross tumoral mass and/or peritoneal metastatic `` implant `` woman operate ovarian carcinoma peritoneal carcinomatosis IV injection ICG ( approve human use ) day operation . Secondary objective : Definition histological distribution ( vessel , extravascular space , specific cell ) IV inject ICG normal pathological tissue ( , demonstrate pre-operatively , node patient find fluorescent remove ) . however goal project : - confirm dissect fluorescent tissue sample malignant histopathology . - study histological distribution ICG tumoral tissue . - investigate florescent tissue peritoneal area surgeon could detect visible tumor implant . - distinguish ICG distribution viable tumor tissue fibrosis necrosis cause chemotherapy normally difficult define scar routinely remove , could identify viable tumor tissue NIF imaging operation room , surgeon avoid dissect benign scar future . Hopefully ICG able help , firstly , score peritoneal cancer index ( PCI ) enhance detection small nodule undetected normal visualization allow 'complete ' surgical treatment disease secondarily , stag patient potential upgrade patient stage I/II stage III case fluoroscopy would allow detect unknown minimal peritoneal carcinomatosis . Methodology : The day operation : ICG 0.25 mg/kg give iv injection day operation . In operating room : When patient open , surgeon ( `` conventional '' video control ) search ( `` orderly fashion '' ) establish `` usual '' presence `` gross '' tumoral mass , metastatic deposit `` scar '' level peritoneal surface . NIR image acquire maneuver fluorescent structure and/or foci anatomically defined surgeon . The operation continue usual anatomical piece control `` ex vivo '' fluorescent character . All fluorescent foci anatomical piece identify mark and/or `` suture '' . If lymph node suspect metastatic ( instance basis PET-CT 18F-DG perform surgery ) , search , ( optionally control vivo visibility use NIR camera ) dissect .</detailed_description>
