	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect immune response DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 decitabine patient myelodysplastic syndrome acute myeloid leukemia . DEC-205-NY-ESO-1 fusion protein , call CDX-1401 , full length NY-ESO-1 protein sequence fuse monoclonal antibody DEC-205 , surface marker present many immune stimulatory cell . This drug give another substance call PolyICLC , act provoke immune stimulatory cell encounter NY-ESO-1-DEC-205 fusion protein produce immune response signal NY-ESO-1 . Immune cell thus prim react NY-ESO-1 may attack myelodysplastic leukemic cell express NY-ESO-1 exposure drug decitabine . The chemotherapy drug decitabine think act several different way , first , may directly kill cancer cell , secondly , drug cause cancer cell re-express gene turn cancer , include gene NY-ESO-1 . Giving DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein ( CDX-1401 ) polyICLC together decitabine may allow immune system effectively recognize cancer cell kill .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate safety Anti-DEC-205-NY-ESOI ( CDX-1401 ) fusion protein ( DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 ) give combination decitabine 20 mg/m^2 intravenously . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate NY-ESO-1 specific cellular humoral immunity determination NY-ESO-1 specific antibody , T-cell clone follow standard treatment 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine ( decitabine ) conjunction immune sensitization Anti-DEC 205-NY-ESO-I fusion protein ( CDX-1401 ) . II . To determine impact decitabine treatment peripheral blood cell patient treat manner NY-ESO-1 target gene expression , NY-ESO protein expression , NY-ESO-1 promoter methylation , global deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) methylation . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To record response rate ( complete response , partial response hematological improvement ) myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) low blast count acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) patient treat combination order provide descriptive characteristic . OUTLINE : Patients receive DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 subcutaneously ( SC ) intradermally ( ID ) poly-ICLC subcutaneously ( SC ) day -14 15 course 1 day 15 course 2-4 . Patients also receive decitabine intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 , 60 , 90 , 180 day .</detailed_description>
