	<brief_summary>In infancy , bronchiolitis common acute infection lower respiratory Tract . The current treatment bronchiolitis controversial . Bronchodilators corticosteroids widely use routinely recommended . Hypertonic saline currently drug recommend Spanish Association Pediatrics treatment guideline . The purpose study quantify whether epinephrine , dexamethasone , hypertonic saline effective decrease rate hospital admission seven day , also verify adverse effect patient submit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Infections remain leading cause death globally , 2010 7.6 million death child 5 year , 64 % attribute infectious cause , acute low respiratory tract include 14.1 % death , represent lead cause global mortality child . In Mexico child 15 year lead cause death condition originate perinatal period , congenital malformation deformity chromosomal abnormality third low airway infection . Bronchiolitis lead cause low respiratory tract infection infant , global load elevate , represent hospitalization rate 3 % total population child one year . Estimated United States America , annual cost hospitalization patient one year bronchiolitis exceed $ 700 million / year . Unfortunately , evidence hospital admission rate increase almost twice last 10-15 year United States Canada , occur impact develop country , befall 99 % death related Respiratory Syncytial Virus ( RSV ) , lead cause infection low airway . The etiology disease attribute 50 80 % case RSV worldwide , report Mexico RSV cause 80 % infection low airway require hospitalization . Given alarm morbidity figure , note mortality disease low , represent less 400 death annually , perhaps explain wide clinical spectrum present . Currently management guide recommend specific treatment bronchiolitis , particular , necessary mention national clinical practice guideline , emphasize consensus proper drug treatment disease . Until 2006 , American Academic Pediatrics guideline Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network recommend use systemic inhale drug management bronchiolitis , widely show include bronchodilator , corticosteroid , antiviral antitussive . Recent review Cochrane Acute Respiratory Infections Group benefit glucocorticoid acute viral bronchiolitis , conclude significantly reduce outpatient admission day 1 7 compare placebo benefit length stay inpatient ; however unadjusted result large factorial low risk bias Randomized Controlled Trial find combined high-dose systemic dexamethasone inhale epinephrine reduce admission 26 % difference short-term adverse effect . L. Hartling et al , 2011 review demonstrate superiority epinephrine compare placebo short-term outcome outpatient , particularly first 24 hour care . In Mexico evidence use dexamethasone combination inhale salbutamol management patient bronchiolitis decrease hospital stay 24hrs 96 % vs 75 % P &lt; 0.05 Furthermore , hypertonic saline ( HS ) proven effective minimal adverse effect thus , currently clinical practice guideline Spain 2010 , recommend method . A study conduct Ipek et al , comparative study four treatment group I Salbutamol + Normal Saline 0.9 % ( NS ) , Group II Salbutamol + HS , Group III HS Group IV NS , measurement variable heart rate , respiratory difficulty scale , oxygen saturation , find treatment group significant improvement breathlessness p &lt; 0.0001 . These finding demonstrate self-limiting nature disease , bring ethical basis use NS control group , per se , significantly reduce respiratory distress indicate clinical practice guideline part management symptomatic . Therefore research aim pilot study population Marina , first , get best treatment evidence , use treatment report well result order establish optimal treatment reduce rate hospital admission minimal adverse effect . Included study , patient mild moderate bronchiolitis , define first event wheeze infant two year history viral infection prodrome attend emergency department ( ED ) period January April 2013 . Supportive care include oxygen supplementation oxygen saturation le 92 % breathing ambient ; aspiration , temperature control hydration necessary provide patient . Infants 2 24 month age bronchiolitis see emergency department eligible study score 2 8 Clinical Bronchiolitis Severity Scores ( CBSS ) . The CBSS value respiratory distress respiratory rate , wheezing , general condition presence retraction scale 0 12 , high score indicate severe illness ; score 9 severe illness . All eligible patient randomly assign one three group accord consecutive order admission ED : group I receive first day one treatment nebulized dexamethasone two treatment epinephrine , follow three day one treatment nebulized dexamethasone ; Group II first day receive three nebulized HS follow treatment HS every 24 hour 3 day group 3 receive NS first day 3 treatment follow one treatment every 24hrs 3 day . The nebulized solution administer double-blind setting every 20 min 3 dos administer ( 0 , 20 40th min ) . The research record patient 's CBSS score , respiratory rate , heart rate , oxygen saturation ambient air baseline , three nebulizations , 60 90 minute ; rectal temperature baseline 90 minute ; blood pressure baseline 90 minute ; side effect throughout observation period emergency department . Followed patient record admission rate group 7 day study , measure efficacy treatment . Likewise measure potential adverse effect group , include hypertension , bronchospasm , tachycardia eventuality , security measure</detailed_description>
