	<brief_title>Pasos Hacia La Salud - Physical Activity Intervention Latinas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In U.S. , Latino woman ( Latinas ) report high rate inactivity non-Hispanic White male counterpart thus disproportionately burden related health condition ( e.g. , cancer , hypertension , heart disease , stroke , diabetes ) . Cultural factor , socioeconomic circumstance , language educational barrier limit Latinas access public health intervention promote physically active lifestyle . To address public health crisis , effective intervention leverage state-of-the-art theory method need reach at-risk population . Our research group 20 year experience develop evaluate individually-tailored , computer expert system-driven , physical activity intervention ( base Social Cognitive Theory Transtheoretical Model ) various channel setting . In recent pilot ( R21NR009864 ) , culturally linguistically adapt tailor intervention sedentary Latinas conduct small randomized trial modify program ( N=93 ) . A total 81 participant complete 6-month study ( 87 % retention ) increase physical activity mean 17 minute per week ( SD=25.76 ) baseline 147 minute ( SD=241.55 ) six month whereas contact control participant increase physical activity 12 minute per week ( SD=21.99 ) baseline 97 minute ( SD=118.49 ) six month . These observed improvement physical activity intervention group , along high retention rate , participant-reported desire Internet-delivered program , formative work develop program Internet format lend support test Internet intervention tailor need Latinas . Therefore , current proposal , build previous work conduct adequately power ( N=200 ) randomize control trial test efficacy culturally linguistically modify , individually tailored physical activity intervention deliver via Internet relative Internet wellness contact control condition ( include cardiovascular health information develop Latinos NHLBI ) . Data collect baseline , 6 month ( post-treatment ) , 12 month ( maintenance ) use well-established physical activity measure ( 7-Day PAR , Actigraphs ) , well comprehensive set psychosocial questionnaire . We hypothesize end treatment ( month six ) intervention participant report significantly minute moderate intensity physical activity per week wellness contact control participant . We also examine maintenance treatment effect 12 month , potential mediator moderator intervention-physical activity relationship , cost deliver tailored Internet program . In proposed study seek promote physical activity among underserved population use high-reach , low-cost , technology-based strategy , great potential adoption large scale thus high potential reduce health disparity U.S .</detailed_description>
