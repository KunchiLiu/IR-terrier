	<brief_summary>This research study PHase II clinical trial , test safety effectiveness investigational combination drug learn whether combination drug work treat specific cancer . `` Investigational '' mean combination drug study . It also mean FDA yet approve drug combination drug use participant , include people type cancer . Tivozanib anti-angiogenesis medicine fight cancer cut tumor 's blood supply get blood nutrient need grow . This drug use research study information research study suggest drug may help slow growth cancer cell . Gemcitabine chemotherapy drug approve FDA treatment pancreatic cancer several cancer . It approve treatment renal cell carcinoma . Previous research suggest combine gemcitabine tivozanib may effectiveness treat metastatic renal cell carcinoma . The purpose research study determine effectiveness tivozanib treatment renal cell carcinoma . The purpose research study also determine combination tivozanib gemcitabine effective treat type cancer cancer become unresponsive get bad tivozanib treatment alone . The safety combination tivozanib gemcitabine also wbe study . Another goal research study learn tivozanib alone combination tivozanib gemcitabine may work treat renal cell carcinoma . During research study perform blood test measure level substance blood protein ( biomarkers ) may predict respond treatment tivozanib gemcitabine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If agree participate study ask undergo screening test procedure confirm eligible . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn take part study . If test procedure recently , may may need repeat . The screening process include follow : medical history , physical examination , measurement vital sign , performance status assessment , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , echocardiogram ( ECHO ) , CT MRI , routine blood test , urine sample , blood pregnancy test . If test show eligible participate research study , begin study treatment . If meet eligibility criterion , able participate research study . This study break two segment . In first segment , receive tivozanib alone . Every 28 day study call study `` cycle '' . You come clinic every 28 day ( month ) , 'day 1 ' 28 day cycle . Tivozanib pill take mouth . You take per day , morning , glass water , without food . You take tivozanib day 1-21 ( first three week ) 28 day treatment cycle . You give Study Drug Administration Diary keep brief record date time take dose tivozanib . The study staff explain complete diary . This review yur visit doctor member study staff . This diary collect visit end cycle , new one give start next cycle . You also pre-dose research blood draw ( approximately 8 teaspoon blood drawn ) prior first dose tivozanib , first cycle tivozanib . Your sample personal information ( name address ) . On Day 1 every cycle : medical history , physical exam , measurement vital sign , performance status assessment , routine blood test monitor health , urine sample . Every cycle ( prior cycle 3 , 5 , 7 etc ) . CT MRI scan , EKG , ECHO . If cancer get bad receive tivozanib alone may eligible participate segment 2 study receive tivozanib combination gemcitabine . You come clinic day 1 8 28 day cycle . Gemcitabine give vein ( intravenously , IV ) period 30 minute study clinic . This call infusion . You receive gemcitabine day 1 8 treatment cycle . You also pre-dose research blood draw ( approximately 8 teaspoon blood drawn ) prior first cycle tivozanib gemcitabine combination , first 28 day cycle tivozanib gemcitabine combination , cancer get bad receive tivozanib gemcitabine combination . Your sample personal information ( name address ) . If doctor determines safe biopsy , undergo fresh tumor biopsy follow time point : Prior receive first 28 day cycle tivozanib gemcitabine combination ; two 28 day cycle ( roughly 2 month ) receive tivozanib gemcitabine combination . On Days 1 8 end study treatment undergo medical history , physical examination , measurement vital sign , performance status assessment , routine blood test urine sample . If unexpected unwanted event happen study , may ask extra test measurement . Some test measurement do study may repeat result usable abnormal . If additional visit require participation study , study doctor may perform follow procedure evaluation : medical history , vital sign measurement , physical exam , ECG , performance status , blood urine test and/or review study drug administration diary . We would like keep track medical condition indefinitely . If hear , would like call every three month see . Keeping touch check condition help u look long-term effect research .</detailed_description>
