	<brief_summary>Background/Justification : Regular physical activity ( PA ) substantial health benefit person type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) , include reduce risk complication cardiovascular mortality . Despite benefit , individual T1D remain significantly less active peer without diabetes . Two major factor likely explain low rate PA young people T1D : ( 1 ) fear post-exercise hypoglycaemia , particularly nocturnal hypoglycaemia , ( 2 ) lack empirical evidence efficacy PA achieve optimal glycaemic control . A number acute exercise trial recently demonstrate inclusion vigorous intensity PA conventional moderate intensity ( i.e . walk ) PA session may overcome limitation . No study test efficacy high intensity PA reduce risk exercise-related hypoglycaemia glycaemic variability randomize control trial ( RCT ) . Study Hypotheses : In person 15-35 year age living T1D , study test hypothesis ( 1 ) addition intermittent vigorous intensity PA moderate intensity intervention reduce time spend hypoglycaemia 12 hour period follow exercise ( 2 ) addition intermittent vigorous intensity PA moderate intensity PA intervention elicit significant improvement glycemic excursion , measure Mean Amplitude Glycaemic Excursions ( MAGE ) , 12-hour period follow exercise.We also explore hypothesis reduce risk hypoglycemia lead sustain increase physical activity one year randomization .</brief_summary>
