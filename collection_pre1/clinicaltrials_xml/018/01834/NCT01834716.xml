	<brief_summary>5.4 million Americans Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) cost $ 185 billion annually , 15 million caregiver look individual . AD sixth lead cause death , one top 10 cause prevent . This study may demonstrate exercise amount attainable many preventative asymptomatic individual include brain Abeta deposition already impend risk disease . Sperling colleague ( 1 ) coin research term AD-pathophysiological process ( abbreviate AD-P ) use study intervention proposal . Our long term goal ass whether exercise may preventative AD old age ( =73 , mean=75 ) , 40 % cognitively normal person A beta deposit , hallmark AD pathogenesis , brain . In NIH RO1 grant submission investigator propose conduct partially blind control preventative trial 150 cognitively normal individual , randomize 2:1 ratio 18 month moderate aerobic exercise versus 18 month tone stretch . All person would baseline 18 month brain Abeta PET study . The study design determine whether exercise intervention person mean age 75 would lead decreased brain Abeta accumulation , increase hippocampal volume , improved cognition , improve dementia-related biomarkers compare control group . The study would unique investigator would able examine aerobic exercise slow accumulation brain Abeta old population , time Abeta deposition common . If successful , would provide additional motivate reason recommend exercise elderly person .</brief_summary>
