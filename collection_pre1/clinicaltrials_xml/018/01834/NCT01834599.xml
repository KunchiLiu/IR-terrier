	<brief_title>Could Cerebral Oximetry Good Technology Measure Placental Oxygenation ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There general agreement among expert recommend use phenylephrine first line therapy treatment arterial hypotension induce spinal anaesthesia caesarean delivery . In study , trend toward low PaO2 value umbilical cord venous blood mother receive vasopressor . These finding may result vasoconstrictor effect phenylephrine utero-placental vessel , subsequent increase oxygen extraction fetus . The possibility extract oxygen would provide certain `` safety margin '' event compromise utero-placental blood flow normal pregnancy . However , `` safety margin '' take granted case sign fetal distress present , situation might influence choice vasopressor . It well establish physiological basis labour , utero-placental blood flow low contraction . This low blood flow could result low saturation value measure cerebral oximeter . Twenty patient labour include study . Patients recruit obstetric clinic pregnancy . Based second trimester ultrasound , patient anterior placenta include . During labour , functional epidural place , Invos oximeter install . Two sensor apply abdomen ( one placenta myometrium place without placenta ) . Two sensor also apply extremity ( forearm leg ) .Saturation value time contraction record sixty minute . Half record do oxygen mask . Vitals sign also register every five minute .</detailed_description>
