	<brief_summary>Pancreatic cancer 11th common type cancer fourth lead cause cancer death . The effective treatment pancreatic cancer include surgery . However , 20 % patient surgically treatable disease . Also , 5-year survival surgically treat patient 15 % . About 40 % patient present advanced disease distant metastasis , remain 40 % present locally advanced unresectable cancer tumor invade surround major vessel . For locally advanced disease , systemic chemotherapy without radiotherapy provide palliation symptom cure disorder . Systemic chemotherapy give peripheral vessel . The investigator hypothesize direct injection chemotherapeutic drug tumor may help boost effect systemic chemotherapy radiotherapy locally advanced pancreatic cancer .</brief_summary>
