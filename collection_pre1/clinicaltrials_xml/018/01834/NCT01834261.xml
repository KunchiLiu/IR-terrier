	<brief_summary>Oxytocin neuropeptide well know role social affiliative behavior human . Oxytocin receptor significantly lower autistic individual administration oxytocin show benefit enhance social recognition behavior autistic child . However , recent research refine behavioral effect oxytocin , move away notion neuropeptide blindly induces love trust , towards view actually increase social perception assess friend vs. foe : support cohesion 'insiders ' distrust aggression 'outsiders . ' Oxytocin responsible selective aggression show lactate female mammal protect young , effect demonstrate also human , show strengthen feeling ethnocentrism . However , neuroimaging study date investigate effect , consequence neurobiological basis still unknown . The general aim study determine meso-circuit brain dynamic underlie oxytocin 's amplification trust aggression ; specifically , use neuroimaging ( fMRI , magnetoencephalography , behavioral test ) whether oxytocin amplifies kinship bias attenuate social reward learning .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study understand oxytocin affect brain behavior . The study compare Syntocinon Nasal Spray placebo . The specific aim : 1 . Determine default circuitry oxytocin ( OT ) . 2 . Determine time-course gender difference default neural response OT . 3 . Using iterative version classical neuroeconomic game ( Trust Study ) , behaviorally test whether OT down-regulates reward learning , thereby enhance effect kinship bias , account polarize effect ( OT increase trust 'in-groups ' increase aggression 'out-groups ' ) . 4 . Identify down-regulation reward learn neurobiologically , via data-driven control system model reward circuit use MRI ( fMRI : time-series analysis orbitofrontal cortex , amygdala , anterior posterior cingulate , nucleus accumbens , magnetic resonance spectroscopy : focusing gamma-Aminobutyric acid neurotransmitter within nucleus accumbens ) magnetoencephalography ( focus dynamic within prefrontal cortex ) . FMRI MRS conduct MRI scan , MEG conduct separately . STUDY PROCEDURES : Nasal Obstruction/Anosmia Screening : All potential subject screen total partial anosmia nasal congestion use University Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test ( Psychological Assessment Resources , Lutz FL ) . Pregnancy Lactation Screening : Oxytocin often use clinically trigger labor late-stage pregnancy . Although none subject late-stage pregnancy subject receive dosage far small used trigger labor , safe potential female subject urine screened pregnancy immediately history physical . Lactation screen perform via self-report , conduct avoid confounds due endogenously produce OT milk-ejection reflex . Oxytocin/Placebo Procedures : Oxytocin intranasal spray manufacture Syntocinon Nasal Spray . The typical dose oxytocin short-term intranasal use 40IU , expect half-life 20 minute . Placebos , identical preparation except oxytocin component , administer manner double blind procedure . To avoid bleed-through condition control order effect , session mixed drug placebo condition : session , conduct separate day , either 'drug ' 'placebo . ' Scanning Procedures : Scanning procedure MRI include : structural scan ( 6 minute ) , fMRI MRS rest state ( 10 minute ) , neuroeconomic task scan ( 10 minute ) . Scanning procedure MEG include : rest state ( 10 minute ) , neuroeconomic task scan ( 20 minute ) . Behavioral Task : During scan , subject participate interactive neuroeconomic game , iterative version classical `` Trust Study '' . During game , subject ( 'investor ' ) first provide sum money . He choice term much invest fictional computer-generated trustee , forced-choice version , choose different trustee . The trustee send percentage back subject ( 'investor ' ) , game iterates many trial . Previous research show OT disrupt participant 's use optimal solution , elicit great `` trust '' trustee would expect Nash Equilibrium . To modulate reward learning , algorithms trustee behavior modulate towards great less generosity . To modulate kinship bias , trustee represent screen use face great less similarity subject , create use MorphMan video-editing software ( STOIK Imaging , Moscow Russia ) .</detailed_description>
