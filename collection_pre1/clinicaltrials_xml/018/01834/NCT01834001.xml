	<brief_summary>Background : - Radiation common treatment prostate cancer . It help damage tumor cell cause die . Radiation effective , tumor may harder treat radiation even surgery . This happen small number men either radiation surgery prostate cancer . Most men hard-to-treat tumor know tumor recur prostate spread another area . Also , men whose prostate cancer recur radiation may different treatment option . This study use improve imaging study well understand men respond well initial radiation treatment . Objectives : - To use detailed imaging study look result local radiation therapy prostate cancer . Eligibility : - Men least 18 year age schedule radiation prostate cancer . - Men least 18 year age whose prostate cancer return earlier treatment . Design : - All participant medical history physical exam . Blood urine sample collect . Imaging study use evaluate cancer start study . - All participant initial full magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan prostate . Tumor healthy tissue sample collect . - Those whose cancer recur treatment discus possible treatment option study doctor . - Participants schedule radiation radiation therapy . This give accord current standard treatment . - After radiation , participant regular follow-up test image study . They another full MRI scan 6 month end radiation treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Radiation therapy commonly use therapy prostate cancer . The majority men prostate cancer cure therapy ; however subset , typically men bulky high risk disease develop PSA failure definitive radiotherapy . Currently , men rise PSA radiotherapy may receive hormonal therapy may undergo evaluation local failure . It know many men rise PSA radiotherapy may local failure would benefit salvage local therapy . With availability grow number local salvage option , accurately define presence characteristic local failure critical . Objective : To determine rate local recurrence patient prostate cancer treat radiotherapy use multiparametric prostate MR guide standard biopsy Eligibility : Patients local therapy prostate cancer : Age great equal 18 year Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate Intermediate high risk prostate cancer ( clinical stage great equal T2b , Gleason score 7 high , PSA great than10 , extracapsular extension seminal vesicle invasion MRI ) . Patient treat radiotherapy prostate cancer . ECOG performance status less equal 2 Patients biochemical relapse radiotherapy prostate cancer : Evidence prostate cancer recurrence ( palpable abnormality radiotherapy , radiographic evidence local failure , biochemical relapse ) ECOG performance status less equal 2 Age great equal 18 year Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma prostate Design : Patients untreated prostate cancer : Participants screen physical examination , medical history , laboratory test ( CBC , chemistry , liver transaminase , PSA , PT/PTT ) , image study ( appropriate staging ) . Patients undergo multiparametric MR image MR guide prostate biopsy suspicious lesion ( diagnostic research ) Patients receive radiotherapy NIH outside facility . Patients return follow 3 month interval first 2 year every six month 5 year PSA measurement . Patients undergo multiparametric MR 6 month therapy . No biopsy obtain unless patient meet definition treatment failure . This study would allow future correlation early change may predict eventual outcome . Patients rise PSA meet criterion biochemical failure Phoenix definition undergo repeat multiparametric prostate MRI biopsy suspicious lesion ( diagnostic research ) . Patients recurrent prostate cancer : Participants screen physical examination , medical history , laboratory test ( CBC , chemistry , Liver transaminases , PSA , PT/PTT ) , image study . Patients undergo multiparametric MR image MR guide prostate biopsy suspicious lesion ( diagnostic research ) 120 patient untreated prostate cancer 70 patient biochemical recurrence radiotherapy accrue study .</detailed_description>
