The aim study assess effectiveness 'Living Successfully Low Vision ( LSLV ) ' program improving quality life ( QoL ) 160 elderly people LV attend Singapore National Eye Centre ( SNEC ) LV clinic . Of , 80 randomly allocate receive LSLV 4-week SM program remain 80 receive usual care . Comparisons make determine efficacy LSLV program . QoL , self-efficacy , emotional well , vision-specific distress assess 2 week training , six month 12 month post intervention . This study first evidenced-based RCT investigate effectiveness novel vision-specific self-management strategy improve QoL . It also adopt longitudinal design effectiveness intervention evaluate 12 months-the first follow-up assessment duration national international level . Furthermore first study characterize profile patient effect program demonstrate improvement primary secondary outcome six month completion . The future clinical implication study include potential implement successful model LV rehabilitation tertiary centre around country .</brief_summary>
