	<brief_summary>The goal study 1 ) examine feasibility acceptability one-day Acceptance Commitment Training + Illness Management ( ACT-IM ) intervention patient comorbid vascular disease risk factor depression anxiety ; 2 ) evaluate effectiveness brief group intervention ( ACT-IM ) , compare Treatment-As-Usual ( TAU ) mental health functioning patient co-morbid mood/anxiety vascular disease risk factor . Patients vascular disease risk factor identify physician Family Practice Internal Medicine , chart review , advertisement . Those vascular risk factor screen assessed symptom depression anxiety . Patients experience significant depressive anxiety symptom interested treatment arm study randomize ACT-IM intervention TAU . Assessments follow take place intervention : depression , anxiety , functioning , illness self-management , blood vessel health , blood .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>One-Day Acceptance Commitment Training Intervention Primary Care Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There difference recruitment , consent , enrollment process ACT-IM TAU group . Patients vascular disease risk factor identify physician Family Practice Internal Medicine , chart review , advertisement . Those respond advertisement refer physician invited complete screen phone call complete on-line screening measure . Potentially eligible patient identify chart review first send letter . This letter follow , least one week later , phone call ass interest study provide information screening . Participants eligible screen contact research team discus study answer question patient may . If patient interested participate treatment arm study , appointment schedule in-person assessment . At in-person baseline assessment , participant provide detailed description study , consent obtain , 90-120 minute assessment begin . Initial Assessment : - vitals ( height , weight , blood pressure , temperature , pules , respiration rate . - blood draw ( test blood fat , sugar , inflammation ( lipid panel ( LIPP ) , glucose ( GLU ) , hemoglobin A1C ( A1C ) , hsCRP ) . For blood draw ask participant consume alcohol 24 hour precede visit . We ask 12 hour fast blood draw . We also ask participant take medication day draw , prescription otherwise . Once blood draw complete , make take medication . - Noninvasive measure blood vessel health ( finger plethysmography ) use EndoPAT** . - Interview : Hamilton Rating Scale Depression Hamilton Rating Scale Anxiety - Self Report measure - Medical chart confirm diagnosis vascular disease , hypertension , diabetes , obesity chart . At end assessment , participant randomly assign , use 2:1 ratio , either ACT-IM TAU . Treatment : Patients ACT-IM group attend 1-day group workshop . Each ACT-IM group hold University Iowa Hospitals Clinics , include 8-12 patient , last 6 hour . The ACT-IM group conduct 2 psychologist IM portion complete physician expertise vascular disease-psychiatric comorbidity . Three broad area cover : 1 ) Illness Management cover importance physical psychological self-care management co-morbid depression/anxiety vascular problem ( e.g . fatigue , stress , poor nutrition management , inadequate physical activity ) ; 2 ) Behavioral Change Training involve ) teaching patient recognize ineffective pattern behavior habit , ii ) explore set life goal relate mental physical health , iii ) promote effective committed action achieve goal despite urge otherwise ; 3 ) Mindfulness Acceptance Training emphasize new way manage trouble thought , feeling , physical sensation ( e.g. , learn recognize , develop cognitive distance unhelpful thought `` I ca n't take anymore '' learn willingly face experience change ) . In-session exercise practice heavily emphasize group intervention . A manual information topic cover group distribute home use . Lunch provide break offer minimize fatigue . Two four week intervention , ACT-IM participant contact one PI 's ask provide qualitative feedback workshop . Follow assessment take place 2- , 6- , 12- , 24-weeks . The 2-week 6-week follow-up complete phone web take 45-60 minute . The 12-week follow-up include interview assessment depression anxiety complete phone . The 24-week assessment replicate baseline visit . Thus , in-person visit , last 90-120 minute . All interview intervention audio tap : 1 ) assessment treatment integrity ( i.e. , ensure therapist follow study procedure ) 2 ) inter-rater reliability interview measure . **At baseline 6 month follow-up , participant undergo non-invasive test endothelial cell function use Endothelial Peripheral Arterial Tone ( EndoPAT ) . The EndoPAT medical device base noninvasive Peripheral Arterial Tone ( PAT ) signal technology . It measure endothelium-mediated change vascular tone use unique bio-sensors place fingertip . These change arterial tone elicit create down-stream hyperemic response induced standard 5-minute occlusion feed artery ( use standard blood pressure cuff ) . When cuff release , surge blood flow cause endothelium-dependent Flow-Mediated Dilation ( FMD ) . The dilation reactive hyperemia capture EndoPAT increase PAT Signal amplitude . A post-occlusion pre-occlusion ratio automatically calculate EndoPAT software , thus provide EndoScore . Measurements opposite arm use control concurrent non-endothelial dependent change vascular tone . Participants ask clip index fingernail visit research assistant may clip fingernail study use sterilized clipper . Fingernails may need clipped long probe .</detailed_description>
