	<brief_title>The Bioequivalence Study Lamotrigine Dispersible/Chewable Tablets 5mg×5 Compared With Lamotrigine Compressed Tablet 25mg Chinese Healthy Male Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single dose , open-label , randomize , two-period crossover study demonstrate bioequivalence lamotrigine dispersible/chewable tablet ( 5mg×5 ) lamotrigine compress tablet ( 25mg ) healthy Chinese male subject fast condition . 24 healthy Chinese male subject enrol provide data least 22 evaluable subject . In Period 1 , subject randomize equal number dose either lamotrigine dispersible/chewable 5mg×5 tablet lamotrigine compress tablet 25mg×1 . Following washout least 14 day , subject cross Period 2 receive treatment receive Period 1 . Pharmacokinetic blood sample collect 168 hour post dose . Venous blood ( 2 ml ) take immediately dose ( pre-dose ) 0.5 , 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 2.5 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 72 , 96 , 120 , 144 168 hour post dose determine lamotrigine concentration serum . Drug concentration serum different time point determine subject validated bioanalytical method use LC/MS/MS method . The main pharmacokinetic parameter Cmax , tmax , AUC ( 0-inf ) , AUC ( 0-t ) , t1/2 , λz , CL/F Vd/F calculate subject use non-compartment analysis method . Physical examination , electrocardiogram clinical laboratory test conduct screen 168 hour administration dose ; vital sign measure scheduled time ; adverse event record throughout study . Clinically relevant safety measurement value tabulate evaluate safety tolerability lamotrigine dispersible/chewable tablet . Safety evaluation last 168 hour second oral administration .</detailed_description>
