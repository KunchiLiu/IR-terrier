	<brief_summary>Heart failure common condition , number people advanced disease continue increase . We need new treatment improve patient ' symptom extend life . Recently new CircuLite Synergy pump come use . It small pump manufacture date cover full work heart , instead provide `` partial '' support . One interesting thing take strain heart might allow muscle repair rebuild strength . This process call reverse remodelling , topic research . Our hypothesis `` partial '' support improve patient ' symptom cause improvement heart muscle function . We also want examine best technique assess , include new scan molecular test , study practical aspect pump blood clotting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The CircuLite Synergy pump new minimally-invasive partial support leave ventricular assist device ( LVAD ) pump blood leave atrium right subclavian artery . Ex vivo pilot data suggest Synergy pump induces structural reverse remodelling , propose Synergy device new disease-modifying therapy . We assess whether Synergy pump facilitate functional , structural molecular LV reverse remodelling vivo ; ass determine predict analysis circulate micro RNA profile specific echocardiographic parameter ; evaluate haematological abnormality associate new LVAD . We address question prospective , observational study compare patient implant Synergy device match heart failure control . The two study centre Royal Brompton &amp; Harefield NHS Foundation Trust ( Harefield Hospital ) University Hospitals Leuven , Belgium . We recruit total 64 patient . The primary outcome change peak VO2 6 month . Secondary outcome include functional parameter , profile circulate microRNA , multimodal echocardiographic assessment comprehensive assessment platelet activation coagulopathy . We quantify LV reverse remodelling associate partial support ; define new echo microRNA marker reverse remodelling clinical use , insight underlie pathophysiology ; describe haematological profile patient guide future antiplatelet anticoagulant therapy .</detailed_description>
