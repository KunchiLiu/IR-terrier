	<brief_summary>The scientific objective study systematically study problem create incise attachment temporalis muscle randomize group patient , determine whether another approach detach temporalis muscle result less post-operative morbidity . Cutting attachment temporalis muscle skull widely-accepted procedure use gain access skull prior drill use pterional craniotomy ( one frequent type surgery use neurosurgical practice ) . Despite frequent use maneuver know sequelae temporalis mobilization ( e.g . post-operative myofascial pain , temporalis weakness , pain mastication ) , little know true incidence post-operative symptom . Furthermore , little objective evidence present time support claim incidence severity post-operative phenomenon decrease use osteoplastic craniotomy ( procedure temporalis leave attached bony calvarium ) . The investigator would like evaluate whether slightly time-consuming technically demand approach less morbid respect contemporary pterional approach . Special note make osteoplastic approach use standard neurosurgical practice quite time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Craniotomy Temporalis Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In contemporary neurosurgery , perform pterional craniotomy , neurosurgeon teach cut detach temporalis drill skull `` turn bone flap '' . While way turn bone flap temporalis still attach ( i.e. , `` osteoplastic craniotomy '' ) , think slightly time-consuming use less often many center . Additionally , common misconception osteoplastic craniotomy allow equivalent view , although recent evidence suggest surgical exposure two approach different . Aside extra time involve , feel leave temporalis attach bony calvarium disadvantage patient fashion ( and—in fact—may result less post-operative morbidity ) . We interested project actually little objective data regard morbidity people experience temporalis muscle cut mobilize prior drill skull . If , study , find group randomize traditional pterional craniotomy experience significantly morbidity group randomize osteoplastic craniotomy , may justify conversion osteoplastic craniotomy many instance . We wish quantify morbidity associate specific method use detach temporalis muscle skull . Many variable regard way temporalis detach record assess group randomize traditional pterional craniotomy . Additionally , many method use measure post-operative temporalis atrophy and/or dysfunction two randomized group . After post-operative morbidity quantify , plan compare traditional pterional group osteoplastic group ass significance .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>The selection participant base solely future plan undergo pterional craniotomy resection tumor . Because patient feedback participation necessary , cognitively impaired patient exclude study . Also , generalize cachexia , prior history craniotomy , reason baseline temporalis asymmetry poor wound healing also reason exclusion study .</criteria>
