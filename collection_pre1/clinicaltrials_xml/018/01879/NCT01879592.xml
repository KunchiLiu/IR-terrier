	<brief_summary>Asthma sickle cell disease serious medical problem . People asthma difficulty breathing , wheeze ( whistle noise breathe ) , cough , produce sputum phlegm , inflammation ( swell , irritation , redness ) narrow bronchial tube . When person asthma sickle cell disease together , serious medical problem occur acute chest syndrome pain episode often . It sometimes hard diagnose asthma person sickle cell disease sickle cell disease also cause lung problem . The purpose study see investigator well understand asthma occurs person sickle cell disease . The investigator take blood , urine , saliva sample . The blood urine sample analyze chemical DNA ( gene ) . Certain gene cause patient sickle cell disease asthma . The investigator use saliva sample future study compare result blood test saliva . The investigator 's long-term goal make sure people asthma sickle cell disease get best asthma treatment . The investigator 's hypothesis analysis blood , urine saliva use method call , metabolomics , may identify unique asthma signature child sickle cell disease may lead targeted treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Molecular Phenotyping Asthma Sickle Cell Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Asthma recently describe disorder multiple subphenotypes despite common symptom presentation . These subphenotypes differ molecular pathway discover difference may lead good diagnosis strategy new treatment . Most study investigate asthma pathway drive scientist 's theory experience thus , consider bias . Metabolomics , excite innovative discipline , represent unbiased , hypothesis free approach define molecular phenotype asthma . Sickle cell disease common genetic disorder ample evidence asthma common co-morbidity asthma prevalence 2 % 45 % compare 12.8 % African American child without sickle cell disease . Acute chest syndrome ( ACS ) contribute cause death 60 % death sickle cell patient strong relationship asthma risk develop ACS increase risk death . Metabolomics study entire repertoire small molecule present cell , tissue , organ biological fluid comprise metabolome . Metabolomics measure downstream product protein , gene , environmental interaction importantly , come close express phenotype , provide opportunity explore gene environment gene gene interaction . A system biology approach use metabolomics advocate good understand pulmonary disease . Asthma sickle cell patient likely molecular fingerprint distinguish asthma non-sickle cell patient . The investigator 's specific aim compare urinary metabolomic profile child asthma sickle cell disease child without asthma sickle cell disease , cohort African American child asthma without sickle cell disease . The hypothesis child asthma sickle cell disease unique metabolomic profile discriminate patient child sickle cell disease respiratory dysfunction asthma , child asthma sickle cell disease . The investigator collect single saliva , urine blood specimen child asthma sickle cell disease , child sickle cell disease , African American child asthma metabolomic analysis . A single urine sample collect health African American child without chronic disease . Blood store future study compare metabolomic variability blood urine . The investigator 's goal use information correctly identify child asthma . These data enhance investigator 's understanding mechanism underlie molecular asthma phenotype sickle cell disease , lead target treatment asthma sickle cell disease . The investigator long-term goal reduce burden asthma child sickle cell disease ( pain , ACS , death ) use innovative system biology approach .</detailed_description>
