	<brief_summary>The study compare diagnostic efficacy VCC ( PillCam COLON 2 ) standard colonoscopy patient prior colorectal surgery . The hypothesis validate VCC mean screen colonic polyp resection , would avoid colonoscopy associate general anesthesia potential side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capsule Versus Conventional Colonoscopy Patient Following Colorectal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Standard care colorectal surgery colon surveillance standard colonoscopy benefit ( gold standard examination , resection lesion ) disadvantage ( acceptability , general anesthesia , availability qualify personnel , risk perforation associate gastrointestinal bleeding ) . Use video-capsule ( VCC ) new , non-invasive technique , allow visualize colon whole . This technique advantage require general anesthesia air insufflation . The examination perform outpatient procedure therefore require hospitalization . In previous study , PillCam COLON 2 show good sensitivity specificity detect colorectal lesion . However , use require excellent bowel preparation . To date , study conduct use VCC monitoring patient prior colorectal surgery , especially passage VCC surgical anastomosis . No information VCC capabilities view recognize surgical anastomosis VCC transit time surgically modify colon available . The possibility precisely locate colorectal lesion prior surgery , use VCC , also remain studied . The study require 2-month patient participation . The planned total study duration 2 year .</detailed_description>
