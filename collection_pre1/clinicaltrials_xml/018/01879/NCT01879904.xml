	<brief_summary>Superficial rectal tumor could remove ESD two major advantage show literature : high rate monobloc resection R0 resection . Hence , recurrence rate low ERM therapy . This technique actually perform routinely Japan experience limit Europe , data literature . This study suggest patient superficial medium distal rectal tumor . The lesion identify demarcated use white-light endoscopy , magnify endoscopy , chromoendoscopy . Then , mark around lesion perform . Local injection make use injection needle , mucosal incision perform around lesion use endo-knives . Submucosal dissection perform use endo-knives . Hemostasis vessel coagulation practice use primary hemostatic forceps procedure . Follow-up one year . For lesion invasive carcinoma ( vessel lymphatic involvement , undifferentiated , free margin le 1 mm ) , surgical resection perform . All patient endoscopic control 3 month ESD ( rectosigmoidoscopy biopsy ) : - For complete resection , endoscopic control perform 1 year . - For incomplete resection , another endoscopic therapy attempt ( EMR ) endoscopic control perform 1 year . At one year , patient incomplete resection surgical resection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Colorectal neoplasia prevalence 35 000 total number 278 000 cancer France 2000 . Treatment cancer base local extension especially digestive tract ( stade ) co-morbidities patient . There many advantage treat cancer early stade ( involve mucosa superficial submucosa ) , since associate well prognosis lower cost-effectivness ratio . Indeed , 2003 mean cost treatment colorectal cancer first year follow diagnosis 24 000 € , whereas 18 000 € early stade 36 000 € advance stade . Transversal ( 1 week ) national survey French society endoscopy ( SFED ) 8 year demonstrate among 1 million endoscopy ( 3/4 perform anesthesia ) , 8000 perform endosocpic treatment early digestive cancer endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) recently endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD ) . One problem diffuse endoscopic treatment multiple tool require endotherapy , fact treatment time-consuming , whereas simple ablation polyp ( polypectomy ) small 1.5 cm need 5 10 minute . For exemple , endotherapeutic tool polypectomy ( one needle one polypectomy loop ) cost 180 € occasionally required couple clip rare ( 1 % ) hemorrhage exceptional ( 1p1000 ) perforation occur . Conversely , endotherapy tool ESD early mucosal submucosal digestive cancer large 1.5 cm 4-5 cm , cost 1500 € , include needle , submucosal injected product , hook-knife , insulinated-knife coagulation rasper . So , recent T2A codification gather two kind endoscopic treatment code , whatever size lesion , whereas cost tool require treatment notably different especially perform inpatient hospitalize less 2 day charge 480 € add 192 € 53€ salary private exercise 914 € public hospital , national public healthcare system . Beside expertise require EMR ESD large early cancer , cost invite increase frequency EMR ESD , take account treatment well practise two simultaneous endoscopists , one manipulate endoscope en endotherapy tool .</detailed_description>
