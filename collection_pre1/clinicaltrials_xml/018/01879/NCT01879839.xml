	<brief_summary>The aim study assess effect diet prior administration contrast agent term preventive procedure lead attenuation contrast-induced nephropathy ( CIN ) . Patients know kidney disease especially risk . A potential beneficial effect diet prior intervention show investigation mammal , therefore study investigate pre-interventional diet patient know kidney disease schedule contrast agent examination attenuate prevent post-interventional loss kidney function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Pre-interventional Diet Renal Function After Administration Contrast Agent Patients Risk</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients contrast agent examination risk contrast-induced nephropathy ( CIN ) succession acute renal failure associate significant morbidity mortality . None currently use preventive procedure show benefit term CIN-prevention . Experimental data suggests , pre-interventional caloric restriction might provide kidney protection context . This clinical trial investigates phenomenon also applicable human . Patients increase risk post-interventional renal failure due know chronic kidney disease randomize 2 group . Patients diet group receive calorie restriction 60 % calculated daily energy rate day -4 day -1 ( include ) pre-intervention ( day 0 corresponds day intervention ) . Patients control group receive alimentation ad libitum . Primary objective increase serum creatinine mg/dl 48 h begin intervention comparison baseline value obtain morning day intervention ( day 0 ) order analyse pre-interventional calorie restriction preventive strategy lead attenuation post-interventioal kidney injury . Hypothesis : A four day calorie restriction reduces increase serum creatinine administration contrast agent patient know chronic kidney disease .</detailed_description>
