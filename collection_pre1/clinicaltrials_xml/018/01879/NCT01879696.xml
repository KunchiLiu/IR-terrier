	<brief_summary>The propose study double-blinded , randomized clinical trial tissue pressure monitoring ( Control group ) vs. tissue pressure monitoring plus tissue ultrafiltration ( Treatment group ) patient tibia fracture present trauma emergency department participate clinical site . Tissue ultrafiltration refers removal muscle interstitial fluid ECSPRESS PMFC . The primary objective study demonstrate whether removal interstitial fluid ECSPRESS PMFC/FC catheter decrease incidence fasciotomy Treatment group compare Control group . Fasciotomy chosen primary outcome clearly define clinically relevant ; reduction fasciotomy clear clinical benefit . Enrolled patient may isolate tibia fracture OR multiple trauma patient ( another major fracture different body region two distinct body system injury , exclude injury opposite leg would preclude complete required test ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Double Blinded , Randomized Clinical Trial Twin Star ECSPRESS Monitoring System Reduction Incidence Fasciotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible patient enrol study receive standard surgical stabilization within 72 hour injury . All Subjects receive Twin Star ECSPRESS catheter , inserted end surgical procedure stabilize tibia fracture connect pressure monitor operate room immediately upon arrival recovery room . The catheter use 24-hours surgical fixation affect low leg order ( 1 ) measure record muscle compartment pressure , ( 2 ) remove interstitial fluid subset subject randomize Treatment Group . Subjects follow closely 24 hour catheter insert gather muscle pressure data , occurrance fasciotomy , adverse event , etc . follow 2 week , 3 month , 6 month 12 month post study enrollment subject participation study complete . There interim data analysis study outcomes conduct study . Data analysis presentation data make study closure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>• Subject isolate tibial shaft fracture require intramedullary nailing , bicondylar tibial plateau fracture tibial plateau fractureknee dislocation require application kneespanning external fixator . OR Subject isolated tibial shaft fracture require intramedullary nailing , bicondylar tibial plateau fracture tibial plateau fractureknee dislocation require application kneespanning external fixator AND another major fracture different body region injuries one major organ system ( head , chest , abdomen , pelvis , genitourinary , spine ) exclude injury opposite leg would preclude complete required test ( see exclusion criterion ) . • Subject isolate tibial shaft fracture require intramedullary nailing , bicondylar tibial plateau fracture tibial plateau fractureknee dislocation require application kneespanning external fixator AND another major fracture different body region injuries one major organ system ( head , chest , abdomen , pelvis , genitourinary , spine ) exclude injury opposite leg would preclude complete required test ( see exclusion criterion ) . All Subjects Operative procedure ( nailing external fixation ) perform within 72 hour injury . The Subject least 18 year age old 44 year age . Subject legally acceptable representative must able understand he/she ask , willing/able understand sign Informed Consent return require followup visit 2 week , 3 month , 6 month , 12 month postsurgery . A legally acceptable representative may sign Informed Consent patient 's behalf . In study investigator opinion , patient 's comorbidity condition ( ) enrollment WILL allow patient return complete require test return visit duration 12month clinical study . • Current evidence CS prior decision regard enrollment . Surgical stabilization result presence bead pouch , VAC , negativepressure wound therapy device , dress would interfere placement four catheter anterior deep posterior compartment . The Subject medical condition ( ) preclude use catheter , dermatologic condition , immunological deficit , traumatic skin lesion interfere Catheter placement . An Injury ipsilateral knee , ankle , and/or foot would influence result muscle test . Opposite leg knee injury tibia , ankle , foot fracture , injury would preclude influence result mechanical muscle test . Incision anterior deep posterior compartment leg study would release fascia would constitute partial fasciotomy would affect leg pressure . The Subject currently enrol one clinical study . Likely problem , investigator 's judgment , maintain followup ( include developmental delay , address great 2 hour drive treat institution , substance abuse problem , intoxication , current pending incarceration , etc . ) .</criteria>
