	<detailed_description>Stroke major cause morbidity mortality among patient cardiovascular disease major cause long-term disability United States . Current image modality determine severity luminal stenosis result plaque , carotid artery . However , cerebrovascular accident ( CVAs ) often associate rupture unstable plaque locate region non-significant degree luminal stenosis . Thus 50 % high-risk atherosclerotic plaque may go undetected untreated . Plaque composition additional perhaps , important risk factor CVA rather stenosis severity alone . Accurate identification high-risk , rupture-prone plaque may potentially prevent CVAs significant number patient . The data collect study ( ultrasonic backscatter histologically process carotid plaque ) provide basis novel algorithm add plaque composition information plaque size location information currently provide standard ultrasound image . The input parameter algorithm derive two type non-invasive ultrasound data : quantitative ultrasound ( QUS ) acoustic radiation force impulse ( ARFI ) image data . QUS analyze frequency content backscatter diagnostic ultrasound signal . These signal currently use imaging , however , image relies solely strength signal form image ignore spectral information . Thus QUS approach use spectral information sensitive number nature scatterers . In contrast ARFI techniques provide information stiffness shear modulus tissue . Two ARFI technique use gather information carotid plaque relate tissue . ARFI base use ultrasonic push pulse slightly move tissue ( displacement order micron ) . From initial start two type ARFI data collect : image relative displacement tissue ( ARFI image ) measurement speed shear wave create tissue displacement ( shear wave speed ) . The ARFI derive data QUS derive data combine clinically available measure currently use diagnosis carotid stenosis form input parameter algorithm . In order train test algorithm plaque remove CEA procedure collect histology slide prepare plaque analyze region ARFI QUS data collect . This histology review provide 'gold ' standard train test algorithm . The majority match set ( 75 % ) use training algorithm . While remainder ( 25 % ) provide test accuracy algorithm type match data . The sensitivity specificity tissue type define histology review report .</detailed_description>
