	<brief_title>Effects tDCS Combined With mCIMT Mental Practice Poststroke Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eighty-four patient chronic post-stroke recruit participate study . After screen check eligibility criterion give informed consent , patient randomize seven distinct group ( 12 per group ) . All patient submit 12 therapeutic session occur frequency three time week . Before , immediately 1 month begin experimental session patient submit evaluation moment apply : ( ) Fugl- Meyer Scale , ( ii ) Motor Activity Log Scale , ( iii ) Jebsen-Taylor hand functional test , ( iv ) Independence Functional Measure ( v ) Box-Block Test , ( vi ) Dynamometry ( vii ) Berg Balance Scale . In experimental session , subject always receive physiotherapy treatment conventional technique , protocol follow guideline outline Clinical Practice Guideline physical therapy stroke patient Royal Dutch Society Physical Therapy ( 2004 ) . Besides physical therapy , patient may subject transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) associate technique modify constraint-induced movement therapy ( mCIMT ) mental practice ( MP ) . tDCS protocol During tDCS session , patient seat comfortable chair head arm rest . Continuous direct current apply clinical microcurrent stimulator ( Soterix , USA ) use pair saline-soaked surface sponge electrode ( surface 35 cm2 ) . For anodal sham stimulation ( polarity refers always motor cortical electrode ) , anode electrode place primary motor cortex ( M1 ; EEG 10/20 system ) affect hemisphere cathode contralateral orbit . For cathodal tDCS , cathode position M1 non-affected hemisphere anode place contralateral orbit . For bi-hemispheric tDCS anode electrode place M1 affect hemisphere cathode M1 healthy hemisphere . Transcranial direct current stimulation administer current strength 1 mA 13 ( anodal/bi-hemispheric tDCS ) 9 min ( cathodal tDCS ) . Sham tDCS perform current flow 30 , method show achieve good level blind mCIMT protocol The modify CIMT consist ( ) complete immobilization non-paretic upper limb ( ii ) intensive train paretic upper limb administer trained therapist , involve pre-post evaluation . Continuously six hour daily period four week , include weekend , patient remain complete immobilization non paretic upper limb . For , arm sling shoulder adduction internal rotation , elbow flexed 90º , wrist finger neutral position , make specifically patient use . They advise use restriction daily activity instruct remove every hour 10 minute perform stretching , previously teach researcher avoid functional deterioration cause disuse . All muscle group upper extremity stretch . A guide instruction stretch distributed patient . The patient instruct take immobilization every day hour tDCS session . In addition , patient allow take arm sling activity safety would compromise , toileting , dress , bath . For intensive training paretic upper limb , patient attend gross motor fine motor activity program perform 1 hour per day , three time per week . Each task perform 2-3 minute rest interval task determine subject order avoid fatigue excessive tiredness . The task progressively adapt increase speed accuracy allow improvement patient performance . All task do subject sit chair standard dimension perform support table . During training session , patient remain non-paretic arm immobilize . Mental practice protocol Prior experimental session , mental capacity subject learn imagery technique test Kinesthetic Visual Imagery Questionnaire chronometric test . The Kinesthetic Visual Imagery Questionnaire imagery assessment tool comprise 10 item , score five-point ordinal scale , include image clarity ( visual dimension ) sensation intensity ( kinesthetic dimension ) body movement . Each item describe action : ( ) neck flexion/extension , ( ii ) shoulder shrugging , ( iii ) forward trunk flexion , ( iv ) forward shoulder flexion , ( v ) elbow flexion , ( vi ) thumb finger tip , ( vii ) knee extension , ( viii ) hip abduction , ( ix ) foot external rotation , ( x ) foot tap . Subjects physically execute movement immediately afterwards imagine perform movement . A score 5 corresponds high clarity/intensity , score 1 corresponds low clarity/ intensity ( review , see Malouin et al. , 2007 ) . The Kinesthetic Visual Imagery Questionnaire score allow researcher assess participant 's ability decide whether subject suitable candidate MP . Comparing actual imagine movement time , chronometric test determine motor imagery ability participant . The mental practice consist motor imagination task . These task consist action patient imagine , great wealth detail possible , perform motor activity hemiparetic upper limb , movement touch thumb 's toe hand , even movement bring cup towards mouth . The technique mental practice apply time tDCS .</detailed_description>
