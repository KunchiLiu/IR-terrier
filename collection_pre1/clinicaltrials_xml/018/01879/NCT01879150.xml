	<brief_title>Pilot Study CyclaPlex Implant , Enhanced Suture Button Implant Device Hallux Valgus Deformity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>INVESTIGATIONAL THERAPY Cycla Orthopedics Ltd develop CYCLAPLEX , minimally invasive enhance type Suture Button implant . It intend : ( ) reduce intermetatarsal angle ( IMA ) 1MT 2MT without osteotomy osteotomy b ) reduce risk 2MT fracture ( ) perform implantation procedure easy safe way . The CYCLAPLEX predicate device `` Suture Button '' type MiniTightrope . It base Mini Tightrope clinical experience , however additional feature increase safety functionality . The CyclaPlex device comprise two bone holder ( 'Anchors ' ) connect metal cord . The cord connect button crimp method part surgery procedures The bone holder T shape screw screw bone drill hole across 2 metatarsal . The gap bone result drill fill enhanced T shape button ( screw ) . A nut reside internally part 1st meet anchor structure . The IMA reduce use specially design tensioning tool CyclaPlex device indicate reduce intermetatarsal angle case IMA le 200 eliminate need traditional 1st metatarsal osteotomy . It use conjunction traditional release lateral MTP joint capsular structure removal medial eminence well regular HVA reduction procedure AKIN . The 2nd Metatarsal fracture risk reduce due multiple/ accumulated factor : ( ) The hole drill 2nd metatarsal reduce significantly ( ii ) The hole fill conical screw head . This firm anchor method enable distribute horizontal force apply gate . ( iii ) The metal screw type device enables bone growth strengthen bone area . ( iv ) The connecting cord house inside screw direct touch bone , , 2nd 1st metatarsal . The device deliver sterilize ( steam sterilization ) double bag reside cardboard box . Dedicated assistive tool multiple use provide well house special tray intend surgery room steam sterilization . The tool comprise Aiming Drilling Guide , , screw driver anchor insertion , Tensioning tool reduction IMA , Crimping tool , cutter , single use drill bit</detailed_description>
