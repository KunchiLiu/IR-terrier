	<brief_summary>Following acute inflammation optic nerve region , commonly see multiple sclerosis patient , optic nerve often undergoes atrophy , thus represent permanent damage . Data animal study suggest amiloride may prevent process . The aim study assess potential neuroprotective effect amiloride acute autoimmune inflammation optic nerve region .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Amiloride Hydrochlorothiazide Treatment Acute Inflammation Optic Nerve</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent study show acid-sensing ion channel 1 ( ASIC1 ) contribute axonal degeneration CNS lesion Physiologically , ASIC1 describe postsynaptic proton receptor hippocampal neuron influence intracellular Ca2+ concentration . In MS , ASIC1 seem activate acidic condition predominate inflammatory CNS lesion lead Na+ Ca2+ overload consecutive damage apoptosis axon . Consecutively , MS mousemodel axonal damage significantly less pronounced administer amiloride , clinically safe blocker ASICs . So ASIC1 seem play major role axonal degeneration MS. To knowledge clinical study test promising vitro result human far . Only one retrospective registry-based cohort study perform . This study show difference risk incident MS hospitalization death among MS patient use amilorid compare use thiazide diuretic . However , study numerous limitation respect 's retrospective designone fact amilorid user vast majority old individual . Such late stage MS course seem best window opportunity intervention neuroprotective agent . Moreover , death may multifactorial parameter correspond axonal damage alone . Consequently , sensitive parameter axonal damage MS need test impact amiloride neuroprotection repair.Based finding describe intend assess potential neuroprotective effect amiloride hydrochlorothiazide ( Amilostad HCTÂ® ) patient optic neuritis ( ON ) , already demonstrate mouse model . ON one common manifestation MS already proven appropiate test neuroprotective agent .</detailed_description>
