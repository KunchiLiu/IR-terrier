	<detailed_description>The management oft fatigue comprises nonpharmacologic approach like exercise , cool procedure , nutrition , energy conservation programme . These strategy consider first-line option since add overall wellbeing , side effect increase patient 's autonomy . However , case strategy suffice keep patient symptom free long term . Also , patient overwhelm severe fatigue unlikely engage exercise . In case add pharmacologic therapy next step . Until , Amantadine , Modafinil , Pemoline use among others , success . Also antidepressants like buprione , fluoxetine , venlafaxine use although never systematically studied management MS-related fatigue . However , mood disorder present , appropriate treat pursue pharmacologic therapy fatigue . Nevertheless , response rate pharmacologic therapy MS-related fatigue totally convince make alternative pharmacologic therapy furthermore desirable . Methylphenidate antagonist dopamine norepinephrine transporter presynaptic neuronal cell membrane . Reduced reuptake result increase extracellular level neurotransmitter . Until , methylphenidate successfully use treat fatigue HIV parkinson´s disease , data efficacy MS available . The aim study determine efficacy methylphenidate treatment MS-associated fatigue . The treatment phase 6 week treatment efficacy measure validated questionnaire ( Fatigue Severity Scale FSS , modify Fatigue Impact Scale MFIS ) neuropsychological test ( Test Attentional Performance ) .</detailed_description>
