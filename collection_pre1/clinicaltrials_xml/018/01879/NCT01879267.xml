	<brief_summary>Huntington 's disease ( HD ) incurable fatal disorder characterise progressive degeneration basal ganglia cerebral cortex . Contrary earlier thinking , HD associate abnormality peripheral tissue might even contribute brain pathology include muscle wasting , mitochondrial abnormality , impaired muscle energy metabolism . Mitochondrial impairment muscle atrophy human HD patient murine model HD associate altered expression PGC-1a , transcriptional cofactor seem regulate many , adaptation muscle fibre chronic endurance training , induces improve exercise performance increase peak oxygen uptake . We aim investigate whether endurance exercise capability stabilize / reverse PGC-1a dependent alteration muscle function structure HD patient , whether muscle training ameliorate musculoskeletal cardiovascular function , well motor cognitive symptom HD patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Huntington disease ( HD ) incurable fatal disorder affect muscle function lead cognitive decline dementia . HD long consider brain disorder meanwhile show HD also affect tissue muscle , lead muscle wasting . Previous study suggest muscle disorder might cause impaired energy metabolism mitochondrial dysfunction , also might also contribute brain pathology . In muscle tissue healthy person , protein name PGC 1- α seem regulate many , adaptation muscle metabolism mitochondrial biogenesis chronic endurance training . It show PGC 1- α reduce muscle tissue human HD patient animal model HD . We aim investigate whether endurance exercise capability stabilize / reverse PGC-1α dependent decline muscle function structure HD patient , whether muscle training ameliorate muscular cardiovascular function , well coordination cognitive decline HD . To end , train 20 male HD patient use 6 month progressive endurance exercise program . In order compare size effect exercise HD patient healthy individual , 20 age-matched healthy male perform identical exercise regimen HD patient . Within one week training period start within one week end , assess metabolic functional data . In addition , analyze muscle tissue sample muscle fiber structure , metabolic phenotype cellular pathology . Finally , gene protein expression analysis perform muscle tissue extract gain insight molecular regulation training adaptation HD .</detailed_description>
