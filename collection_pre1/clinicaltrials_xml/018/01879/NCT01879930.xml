	<brief_title>Chronic Bladder Pain Syndrome Women : Can Doxycycline Help ? A Prospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Doxycycline use treat bacterial infection . Doxycycline class medication call tetracycline antibiotic . In addition general indication member tetracycline antibiotic group , doxycycline frequently use treat chronic prostatitis pelvic inflammatory disease . Especially intracellular agent , chlamydia , generally susceptible doxycycline . Assuming infection responsible chronic bladder pain syndrome woman , therapy perform accordance authorise indication dosage.Bacterial cystitis exclusion criterion diagnosis chronic bladder pain syndrome . However , detection microorganism Chlamydia trachomatis , Ureaplasma urealyticum Mycoplasma genitalium remain challenge organism may well involve pathogenesis chronic bladder pain syndrome . This supported finding retrospective study1 doxycycline orally 4 week include therapy sexual partner lead reduction symptom 71 % woman complain persistent urgency frequency , chronic urethral and/or bladder pain . Therefore , doxycycline therapy sensible , especially consider , costly often little effective symptomatic treatment option . Thus , aim investigate effectiveness doxycycline woman chronic bladder pain syndrome prospective , randomised , placebo-controlled , double-blind study . Chronic bladder pain syndrome chronic disable disorder characterize chronic pelvic pain , pressure discomfort perceive related urinary bladder accompany least one urinary symptom persistent urgency frequency absence identifiable cause2 . In Europe , prevalence rate woman range 306 450/100'0003,4 - much high previously estimate . Thus , chronic bladder pain syndrome serious economic problem every health care system . In addition , chronic bladder pain syndrome severely decrease individual 's quality life represent significant financial burden affect . Currently , multifactorial pathogenesis assume include endocrine-involvement , pelvic floor muscle irregularity , immunologic aspect chemical cause . Corresponding wide spectrum presumptive trigger , large number therapeutic approach propagate , however associate limited effectiveness . Thus , treatment BPS challenge ideal therapy remain elucidated . We hypothesise doxycycline orally 4 week , include therapy sexual partner , significantly relieve symptom woman chronic bladder pain syndrome . Objective To proof reject effectiveness doxycycline treatment chronic bladder pain syndrome Methods This prospective , randomised , placebo-controlled double-blind trial . Recruitment study participant perform urologic outpatient clinic University Hospital Inselspital Bern . The randomisation-list institute pharmacy University Hospital Inselspital Bern accessible unblinded employee . In case unblinding authorized member blind trial team contact 24-hours service-number pharmacist on-duty institute pharmacy . After disclosure patient-number , pharmacist on-duty performs unblinding informs authorize unblinded trial-member allocation . Finally unblinding register randomization list pharmacist on-duty . The unblinded trial-member record name person perform unblinding date reason unblinding patient 's medical record .</detailed_description>
