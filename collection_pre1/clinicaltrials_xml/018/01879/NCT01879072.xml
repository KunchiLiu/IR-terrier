	<detailed_description>The goal protocol establish cohort biologic sample collect prospectively patient treat BMT CTN center share bio specimen resource conduct future allogeneic HCT correlative study . This resource design allow genomic , proteomic transcriptional data integrate high quality clinical phenotype outcome data identify risk factor development severity acute GVHD , chronic GVHD , organ toxicity , relapse , mortality , infection clinically significant complication occur allogeneic HCT . To achieve goal , patient donor recruit consent obtain time enroll BMT CTN protocols enrollment occur transplantation prior start condition patient enrol non-BMT CTN study treat standard care . Samples collect : ( 1 ) patient donor pre-transplant ; , ( 2 ) patient post-transplant calendar schedule first 3 month post-HCT . For patient co-enrolled BMT CTN study , clinical data collect context primary transplant protocol . For patient enrolled BMT CTN protocol , clinical data early post-transplant event collect use data collection form system use BMT CTN trial . Additional clinical data BMT CTN non-BMT CTN patient available data submit Center International Blood Marrow Transplant Research ( CIBMTR ) use CIBMTR Comprehensive Report Forms . This protocol also leverage ongoing pre-transplant donor-recipient sample collection perform CIBMTR National Marrow Donor Program ( NMDP ) . Success establish share resource inspire future investigator initiate research proposal allow investigator take advantage National Institutes Health ( NIH ) funding initiative .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Recipients first allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant transplant U.S. center participate NMDP/CIBMTR 's `` Protocol Research Sample Repository Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Marrow Toxic Injuries '' receive cord blood graft receive bone marrow peripheral blood graft relate donor unrelated donor NMDPaffiliated Donor Center Registry participate protocol . This transplant donor center restriction allow linkage pretransplant donor specimen collect NMDP/CIBMTR protocol . Current data indicate &gt; 90 % donor approach protocol agree provide sample 2 . Patients malignant nonmalignant hematologic disorder eligible enrollment protocol . A subset 240 sequential patient acute leukemia first second remission also provide research sample gene expression study . 3 . Children may participate study must weigh least 20 kilogram give volume ( 100ml ) number blood draw study . Subjects must weigh least 30 kg provide research sample gene expression study ( additional 40 ml ) . 4 . All participant parent/legal guardian must sign informed consent study . Because study use resource require link clinical data collect CIBMTR , participant parent/legal guardian must also consent participate `` Protocol Research Database Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Marrow Toxic Injuries '' .</criteria>
