	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well erlotinib hydrochloride work surgery treat patient stage III non-small cell lung cancer . Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving erlotinib hydrochloride surgery may make tumor small reduce amount normal tissue need remove .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Hydrochloride Before Surgery Treating Patients With Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate rate mediastinal nodal clearance complete pathological response neoadjuvant erlotinib ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) patient epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutate stage III non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression free survival patient population EGFR mutate stage III NSCLC patient treat neoadjuvant erlotinib therapy . II . To determine overall survival . III . To estimate overall response rate neoadjuvant erlotinib . IV . To estimate surgical resection rate . V. To evaluate safety neoadjuvant erlotinib . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine several molecular cellular biomarkers tumor , skin serum predictive efficacy neoadjuvant erlotinib . OUTLINE : Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 2 month undergo thoracotomy . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
