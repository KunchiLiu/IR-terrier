	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether consume calcium carbonate micronized effective traditional form calcium carbonate maintain increase bone mineral density people currently take bisphosphonates bone-health medication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Changes Bone Mineral Density Function Consuming Two Different Forms Calcium Carbonate</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Addressing need form supplemental calcium could facilitate increase BMD without adverse effect often report limestone-based form calcium , patent technology developed increase calcium absorbability use Zet Mill/Ball Mill bottom-up pulverizing technology 4D top-down ebonite charge technology create novel form calcium refer micronized calcium carbonate ( MCC ) . In comparison technology use water high heat , result loss core nutrient decrease product efficacy , calcium produce unique pulverize technology micron-sized ( 0.03um - 10um ) therefore believe effective . While tiny size think increase absorption , belief intense activation zinc via patented ebonite charge process could maximize bioavailability calcium .</detailed_description>
