	<brief_summary>Neuroblastoma common extracranial solid tumor childhood , nearly 50 % patient present widespread metastatic disease . The current treatment group high-risk patient include intensive multi-agent chemotherapy ( induction ) follow myeloablative therapy stem-cell rescue ( consolidation ) treatment minimal residual disease ( MRD ) isotretinoin . Recently new standard care establish enhance treatment MRD addition monoclonal antibody ( ch14.18 ) target tumor-associated antigen , disialoganglioside GD2 , uniformly express neuroblast . Despite improvement 2-year event-free survival ( EFS ) 20 % , one-third child high-risk neuroblastoma ( HR define ) still cure approach . Therefore , novel therapeutic approach need subset patient . This study pilot Phase II study unique anti-disialoganglioside ( anti-GD2 ) monoclonal antibody ( mAb ) call hu14.18K322A , give induction chemotherapy . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : - To study efficacy [ response : complete remission + partial remission ( CR+PR ) ] two initial course cyclophosphamide topotecan combine hu14.18K322A ( 4 doses/course follow GM-CSF ) previously untreated child high-risk neuroblastoma . - To estimate event-free survival patient newly diagnose high-risk neuroblastoma treat addition hu14.18K322A treatment . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : - To study feasibility deliver hu14.18K322A 6 cycle induction chemotherapy describe antitumor activity ( CR+PR ) 6 course induction therapy . - To estimate local control pattern failure associate focal intensity modulate proton beam radiation therapy dose delivery high-risk abdominal neuroblastoma . - To describe tolerability four dos hu14.18K322A allogeneic natural killer ( NK ) cell acceptable parent , immediate post-transplant period [ day +2 - +5 peripheral blood stem cell ( PBSC ) infusion ] consent participant . - To describe tolerability hu14.18K322A interleukin-2 GM-CSF treatment minimal residual disease ( MRD ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The phase study : 1 . Screening phase : Tests evaluations do treatment start . 2 . Induction phase : Includes chemotherapy plus hu14.18K322A mAb . Participants also surgery part study remove much tumor possible . 3 . Consolidation/Intensification phase : Includes high dos chemotherapy blood stem cell transplantation additional , experimental `` minimal residual disease '' ( MRD ) treatment.. Participants also get radiation treatment sit tumor ( ) recovery stem cell transplant.5 . Maintenance/MRD treatment phase : With immune therapy addition standard treatment drug isotretinoin . 4 . Maintenance/MRD treatment phase : With immune therapy addition standard treatment drug isotretinoin .</detailed_description>
