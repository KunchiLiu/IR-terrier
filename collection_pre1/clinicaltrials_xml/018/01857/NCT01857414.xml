	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate whether Remote Ischaemic Conditioning ( RIC ) improve clinical outcome ( cardiac death hospitalisation heart failure ) one year patient present ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction undergo primary percutaneous coronary intervention . This do multinational investigator-driven , multi-centre , randomise , control , single-blind , parallel assignment , prospective clinical efficacy trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect RIC Clinical Outcomes STEMI Patients Undergoing pPCI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Coronary heart disease ( CHD ) lead cause death Denmark Europe , account 1.92 million death Europe per year : one five men ( 21 % ) one five woman ( 22 % ) die CHD . Patients present ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction ( STEMI ) despite advanced treatment primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( pPCI ) significant mortality morbidity one year 17.4 % patient die cardiovascular cause hospitalise heart failure . Remote Ischaemic Conditioning ( RIC ) apply time myocardial reperfusion reduce myocardial infarct size , confirm existence myocardial reperfusion injury . In respect , RIC show limit myocardial infarct size preserve cardiac function STEMI patient undergo pPCI . RIC perform ambulance transport PCI unit cycle inflation blood pressure cuff induce four 5-minute cycle limb ischaemia reperfusion . The method virtually cost-free non-pharmacological non-invasive therapeutic strategy . Hypothesis : RIC follow pPCI improves clinical outcome STEMI patient compare STEMI control undergoing standard pPCI evaluate one year post PCI . Trial Design aim : Multinational investigator-driven , multi-centre , randomize , control , single-blind ( Outcomes Assessor ) , parallel assignment , prospective clinical efficacy trial . A total 4300 patient include 36 month period . Overall primary objective To determine whether RIC improve clinical outcome ( Cardiac mortality hospitalisation heart failure ) one year 4300 STEMI patient undergo pPCI . Secondary objective : To determine , pre-specified subgroup , whether age , gender , diabetes , duration chest pain PCI influence response RIC . To determine whether RIC preserve leave ventricular function measure echocardiography three month post pPCI . Study progress The patient inform treat accord national international guideline Good Clinical Practice protect Act concern process personal data health law . The admit ambulance doctor doctor receive hospital orally inform patient hand approve short write information . After information give acute phase patient much time reflection signing informed consent form . Therefore full write information additional oral information give patient acute phase study nurse doctor perform pPCI . As well first second stage information emphasise patient right withdraw his/her inform consent time . After informed consent obtain patient randomise via secure web-site either pPCI without RIC doctor duty receive hospital . Computer-generated blocked randomisation list , stratify centre , prepare advance study . pPCI incl . use stent antithrombotic regimen perform accord standard procedure treat hospital . Blood sample ( acute , 6-8 , 24 48-72 hour pPCI draw acute phase treat hospital local hospital . Three day pPCI echocardiography ( ECCO ) perform hospital . Further three month pPCI ECCO perform hospital . Information regard re-hospitalisation death drawn electronic patient chart . Benefit study Potential benefit : Participating patient offer extra clinical patient control , incl . echocardiography three month pPCI . Disadvantage : In relation inflation blood pressure cuff temporary moderate pain treat arm might occur . Otherwise , RIC previously proven without side effect . An extra blood sample app . 15 ml draw 48-72 hour pPCI . A small insignificant risk local infection relation risk .</detailed_description>
