	<brief_summary>Laparoscopy become gold standard surgical treatment benign ovarian cyst usually perform strip ovarian cyst wall , follow bleed control ovarian wound ground use bipolar coagulation . However , hemostasis bipolar coagulation could result damage ovarian reserve decrease response ovaries hormonal stimulation assist reproductive technology . The possible mechanism may contribute thermal destruction ovarian follicle excessive use bipolar coagulation hemostasis purpose . To avoid additional ovarian tissue damage conventional bipolar coagulation potentially important ovarian reproductive function , hemostasis use various topical hemostatic agent introduce control post-cystectomy ovarian wound bleeding . Among , FloSeal ( Baxter Healthcare Corporation , Deerfield , IL , USA ) hemostatic matrix sealant compose gelatin-based matrix thrombin solution . On come contact blood application bleed site , gelatin particle swell tamponade bleeding . The bulk gelatin matrix-thrombin composite effect slow blood flow provide exposure high thrombin concentration , thus hasten clot formation . Therefore , may suitable use post-cystectomy ovarian wound bleeding , superficially pervasive focus bleeding . Ovarian reserve define functional potential ovary , reflect number quality antral follicle leave ovary , correlated response ovarian stimulation use exogenous gonadotropin . Serum anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone ( AMH ) accept reliable easily measurable marker postoperative assessment ovarian reserve . The investigator conduct multicenter , large-scale , randomize control trial investigate whether hemostasis Floseal superior bipolar coagulation preserve ovarian reserve assess serial AMH level patient undergo laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy benign ovarian cyst .</brief_summary>
