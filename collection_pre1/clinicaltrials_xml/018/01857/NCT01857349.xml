	<brief_summary>The goal study determine superiority surgical scrub preparation total knee arthroplasty base bacterial count present skin surface deep joint tissue . These count obtain culture skin prior scrub preparation , post preparation application sterile drape , deep joint tissue sample prior wound closure , immediately post wound closure . This study provide assessment management sterility compare quantitative qualitative culture immediately surgical scrub preparation maintenance sterility throughout procedure . This study enhance prior research effort contribute quantitative bacterial load bacterial load within surgical wound closure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Prospective randomize study commonly use surgical prep solution compare superiority Chloraprep Duraprep - Primary Outcome Measure : Quantitative qualitative bacterial load pre-surgical preparation , post-surgical preparation , post-wound closure obtain skin culture one deep joint tissue culture joint space prior wound closure . - Secondary Outcome Measure : Rates surgical site infection ChloraPrep DuraPrep group outline . Patient Population : Subjects recruit Dr. Brindley 's Dr. Jenkins clinic select primary total knee arthroplasty . Inclusion criterion : - &gt; 18 year old less 89 - Undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty - Not undergo surgical intervention infection Exclusion criterion : - Injury due trauma - Open wound incision site determine pre-op history physical - Abrasion vicinity plan incision site determine pre-op history physical - Active infection near surgical incision site determine pre-op history physical - Active infection somewhere else body determine pre-op labs history physical - Prior history surgical infection bacteremia determine pre-op history physical - History rheumatoid arthritis determine pre-op history physical - History autoimmune disorder determine pre-op history physical - Immunosuppressed patient determine pre-op history physical - Known allergy iodine , isopropyl alcohol Chlorhexidine Subject recruitment : A total 120 patient recruit participate study upon consent surgical intervention base calculation see statistical difference culture result duraprep chloraprep . Please see statistical analysis section detail justification recruit 120 patient . All patient undergoing total knee primary operation consider consecutively study . Patients receive undue influence incentive participate study . Study Procedure : Patients send OR randomize folder pre-made computer program ( Stata Version 12 College Station , TX ) provide randomization patient enrol study contain paper state surgical prep solution use . On cover folder sheet paper follow information fill return research coordinator . See Attachment - Patient randomize identification number - Check box Chloraprep Duraprep - check open seal folder - Start time prep - End time prep - Instructions , take 8 separate culture 1 tissue sample - Check box ensure culture finish send lab - Incision start time - Surgery end time Chloraprep vs. Duraprep A. Pre Operative standard Care : Perioperative Antibiotics : All patient receive Standard preoperative antibiotic per institution protocol type non-microbial drape use case accord Dr. Brindley 's standard protocol surgery . Patients receive 1 2g cefazolin ( base weight ) prior surgery unless allergy penicillin , case receive 900mg clindamycin . B . Skin Preparation 1 . Patients enrol study randomized time enrollment surgery treat one two widely use Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) -approved , surgical skin preparation solution : ChloraPrep ( 2 % chlorhexidine gluconate 70 % isopropyl alcohol ; Enturia , El Paso , Texas ) DuraPrep ( 0.7 % available iodine 74 % isopropyl alcohol ; 3MHealthcare , St. Paul , Minnesota ) . The agent use patient determine immediately prior skin preparation opening seal , randomly-assigned envelope state prep use . Due unique shape color scrub feasible cover label prep use randomization . The surgical site prepped usual sterile fashion use 2 stick either ChloraPrep DuraPrep . Each operating room contain enough 4 stick unforeseen error ( drop prep solution surgical site preparation patient ' body habitus , etc. ) . 2 . Randomization Folders label include : . Patient randomize ID ii . Check box Duraprep Chloraprep iii . Starting time prep end time prep iv . Time start surgery ( Each scrub solution set time dry 's label document scrub allow dry appropriate time start surgery . Chloraprep 3 min : : : :Duraprep 3 min ) C. Knee sit : 1 . Midline anterior patella 2 . Midline - popliteal area Please See Attachment - Flyer instruction culture sit 1 . First Culture native skin ( specimens sit 1 2 ) - To take time consent History Physical pre-surgery visit educate study include resident , research coordinator , hold room/pre-op nurses/ staff prior sterile agent use include alcohol wipe chlorhexidine bath . 2 . Second culture ( specimens sit 1 2 ) - take OR surgical prep solution apply , pre-op surgical scrub do . 3 . Third Culture ( specimens sit 1 2 ) - To take application Duraprep Chloraprep wait appropriate timing ( 3 minute ) application sterile drape Tissue Culture ( one specimen ) - To take tissue sample within 1 cm lateral side patella/patellar implant . Will excise use scalpel . This tissue sample weigh homogenized provide quantitative qualitative culture . 4 . Fourth Culture ( specimens sit 1 2 ) - To take final closure wound removal sterile drape . Culture must take within 1cm incision . Total 9 culture per participant Method Obtain Cultures - Primary surgeon , resident surgeon hold room nurse educate utilized obtain culture . Each culture take 17x17mm square area ( The length culture brush ) area skin site provide standardize area quantitative culture . A neutralizing solution use prior taking culture stop kill action chlorhexidine duraprep order provide accurate result time culture . The neutralizing solution formula base study Savage et al [ 10 ] outline . Cultures mark identification base site time culture , place envelope patient 's randomized ID . The culture folder deliver Dr. Hamood 's microbiology lab locate TTUHSC campus . Neutralizing solution quote Savage et al [ 10 ] - The swab place seal sterile transport container immediately bring microbiology laboratory institution . All culture monitor seven day . - The ChloraPrep sampling ( neutralize ) solution consist 0.04 % monobasic potassium phosphate , 1.01 % dibasic sodium phosphate , 0.1 % Triton X-100 , 1.0 % polyoxyethylene sorbitan monooleate ( Tween 80 ) , 0.3 % lecithin , 1.0 % Tamol . The DuraPrep sampling ( neutralize ) solution consist 0.04 % monobasic potassium phosphate , 1.01 % dibasic sodium phosphate , 0.1 % Triton X-100 , 0.2 % sodium thiosulfate . The pH solution adjust 7.9 Â± 0.1 prior dispense water dilution bottle steam sterilize twenty minute 121_C . An independent contract laboratory ( Microbiotest , Sterling , Virginia ) formulate tested neutralization solution find effective nontoxic . D. Culture Analysis Dr. Colmer-Hamood and/or student train Dr. Colmer-Hamood receive sample , prepare specimen quantitative culture , plate specimen quantitation aerobic anaerobic growth . Tissue sample grind 1 ml sterile broth evenly distribute microorganisms present allow quantitative culture . Cultures monitor 7 day post-inoculation , due average time require detection Propionibacterium acne first growth 5.1 day [ 1 ] . All colony count morphotype sub-cultured identification . Standard Total bacterial load colony form unit ( CFU ) calculate per mm2 skin swab gm tissue . CFU individual specie also calculate . Results document data collection form review . E. Data Reporting Data report Dr. Colmer-Hamood 's lab include quantitative qualitative bacteria connect patient 's randomized number . This data store password protect workstation Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center campus Lubbock , Texas . Data also take medical record base history physical preoperative postoperative evaluation . Patients monitor 3 month post operatively wound infection . These wound infection report study , incidence two surgical prep solution calculate due number patient required meet statistical power . We follow CDC 's definition surgical site infection ( SSIs ) report data [ 12 ] .</detailed_description>
