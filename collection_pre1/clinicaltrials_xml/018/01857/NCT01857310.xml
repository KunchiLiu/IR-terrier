	<brief_summary>The overarch goal trial determine intervention comprise folic acid zinc dietary supplementation improve semen quality indirectly fertility outcome ( i.e. , live birth rate ) among couple try conceive seek assisted reproduction . The follow study objective underlie successful attainment overarch research goal : 1 . To estimate effect folic acid zinc dietary supplementation semen quality parameter , include limited concentration , motility , morphology , sperm DNA integrity , relative placebo group . 2 . To estimate effect folic acid zinc dietary supplementation fertility treatment outcomes [ fertilization , embryo quality , implantation/human Chorionic Gonadotropin ( hCG ) confirm pregnancy , clinical pregnancy , live birth ] , relative placebo group . 3 . To estimate association semen quality parameter , sperm DNA integrity fertility treatment outcome ( fertilization , embryo quality , clinical pregnancy , live birth ) identify best combination semen quality parameter prediction clinical pregnancy live birth . 4 . To estimate effect folic acid zinc dietary supplementation fertilization rate among couple undergo assisted reproductive technology procedure , relative placebo group . 5 . To estimate effect folic acid zinc dietary supplementation embryonic quality among couple undergo assisted reproductive technology procedure , relative placebo group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Folic Acid Zinc Supplementation Trial ( FAZST )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two micronutrient fundamental process spermatogenesis , folic acid ( folate ) zinc , particular interest fertility low cost wide availability . Though evidence inconsistent , small randomize trial observational study show folate zinc biologically plausible effect spermatogenesis improve semen parameter . These result support potential benefit folate spermatogenesis suggest dietary supplementation folate zinc may help maintain improve semen quality , perhaps , fertility rate . The Epidemiology Branch Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute Child Health Human Development intend conduct multi-site double-blind , randomize control clinical trial evaluate effect folic acid zinc dietary supplementation semen quality conception rate among male partner couple seek assisted reproduction . Randomization stratify ( random sequence block size ) site assist reproduction technique ( IVF , non-IVF receive fertility treatment study site , non-IVF receive fertility treatment nonstudy site ) ensure balance treatment group maintain within site within fertility treatment type enrollment period . The study design sample size 2,400 randomize participant base obtain adequate power detect meaningful difference live birth rate cohort . Since comparison sperm parameter difference continuous assay measurement , sample size sufficient primary sperm parameter comparison . Additionally , calculation do demonstrate adequate statistical power stratify analysis perform ( i.e. , sample size distribution among strata correspond live birth RRs detect 80 % statistical power , alpha level 0.05 total sample size 2400 couple divide among folic acid/zinc placebo arm trial ) . Data collection include screen male female partner eligibility , administer baseline questionnaire , collect biospecimens partner couple , body measurement partner , daily journal report male partner , medical record abstraction relate required treatment outcome data , semen quality four sample collect baseline , two , four , six month follow study enrollment . A data coordinating center ( DCC ) support trial . The primary analysis plan base `` intention-to-treat '' ( ITT ) approach compare two cohort base randomized assignment , overall treatment stratum ( IVF , non-IVF receive fertility treatment study site , non-IVF receive fertility treatment nonstudy site ) .This approach apply two primary endpoint ( semen parameter live birth rate ) well designate secondary endpoint ( number follicle , number proportion oocytes fertilize ) . The DCC perform periodic safety analyse present interim report Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) request , recruitment phase trial . It anticipate safety analysis perform every 6-12 month . The final analysis perform upon completion data collection edit follow-up close-out phase trial . Also one full formal interim analysis plan power calculation consideration choice optimal time analysis conduct .</detailed_description>
