	<brief_summary>There currently experimental model accurately represent sarcoidosis . The lack useful research model significantly slow progress towards develop new treatment sarcoidosis . The investigator plan develop new model sarcoidosis research test model see help u understand sarcoidosis develop useful test new treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Novel Human In Vitro Sarcoidosis Model</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sarcoidosis systemic granulomatous disease unknown cause , commonly affect lung , tend afflict young adult prime life . Recent data indicating sarcoidosis mortality rate rise U.S. ( 1 ) Europe ( 2 ) highlight inadequacy current therapy . As noted recent NIH-sponsored sarcoidosis workshop , lack relevant animal , computer vitro model represent bottleneck progress towards understand disease mechanism develop highly effective sarcoidosis treatment ( 3 ) . The lack useful disease model likely contributes current lack ( zero ) investigator-initiated ( RO1 ) project support sarcoidosis research . The long-term goal proposal develop novel human sarcoidosis research model fill current void field , thereby expedite exploration basic disease mechanisms pre-clinical test novel therapy . The objective application , first step towards achieve long-term goal , develop novel vitro human granuloma model represent abnormal granuloma formation context sarcoidosis . In regard , grow body evidence indicate mycobacterial antigen commonly harbor sarcoidosis tissue , patient sensitize ( 4 , 5 ) . Our central hypothesis pathological mechanism sarcoidosis model vitro , represent abnormal granuloma formation response mycobacterial ubiquitous environmental antigen . The feasibility propose model support preliminary study show subject sensitized Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen ( latent TB tuberculosis positive TB skin test ) form well-organized granuloma readily response challenge TB antigens , compare healthy control . This project highly innovative feel excellent likelihood lead critical breakthrough field sarcoidosis research .</detailed_description>
