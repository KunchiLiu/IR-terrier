	<brief_title>Treatment Extraesophageal Reflux With Reza Band UES Assist Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine safety effectiveness non-invasive Reza Band UES Assist Device treatment esophagopharyngeal reflux extra-esophageal symptom ( chronic cough , choke , aspiration , chronic post nasal drip , globus , sore throat , throat clearing ) . Reza Band wear sleep . The patient put Reza Band bedtime take upon wake . This prospective , non-randomized , open label , multicenter study design ass safety effectiveness Reza Band . At 5 investigational site , 100 subject enrol . The primary effectiveness endpoint evaluate Reflux Symptom Index ( RSI ) . Success define &gt; 25 % reduction RSI last follow-up , compare baseline RSI . The RSI validate nine-item patient-administered outcome questionnaire design document symptom severity . Patients ask rate nine problem affect scale 0 ( problem ) 5 ( severe problem ) , maximum total score 45 . All adverse reaction report evaluated frequency percent subject reaction summarize severity relationship Reza Band . Since subject may report event several time ( e.g. , redness ) , first occurrence worst report case event use purpose analysis . The incidence site reaction , include laryngospasm , choke , pain , cough hoarseness summarize . Exact 95 % confidence interval incidence rate site reaction present .</detailed_description>
