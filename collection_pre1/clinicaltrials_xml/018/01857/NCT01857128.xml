	<brief_title>Pilonidal Disease Wound Healing Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study prospective randomize open-label study examine efficacy Drawtex速 Hydroconductive wound dress negative pressure wound therapy ( NPWT ) pilonidal cystectomy wound heal secondary intention . Pilonidal disease significant impact active duty demographic treatment disease result substantial cost military duty day lose medical care provide . This study examine Negative Pressure Wound Therapy ( NPWT ) Drawtex速 Hydroconductive Dressing treatment surgical wound result limited excision pilonidal disease . This clinical trial prospective , randomize open label examination two standard wound therapy modality goal determine treatment promotes rapid wound heal secondary intention . Secondary goal include determine treatment cost effective acceptable patient . Active duty , retire , dependent adult ( age 18-60 year ) schedule undergo limited surgical cyst excision recruit patient refer General Surgery Department Walter Reed National Military Medical Center ( WRNMMC ) . Health care provider General Surgery Department inform study request refer appropriate patient study Investigators evaluation potential inclusion study . The informed consent process occur WRNMMC , General Surgery Clinic pre-operative clinic visit ( ) . If patient consent screen inclusion study , assign subject number randomly assign study arm , either NPWT Drawtex速 , preoperatively . The subject undergo limited excision pilonidal cyst . If result wound post-surgery meet enrollment criterion , subject enrol study . At point , randomization arm reveal either NPWT Drawtex速 dress . Wound care do wound care clinic two time week ( biweekly ) approximately 4 week 75 % epithelialization , weekly monthly basis 100 % epithelialization wound 270 day follow reach . Wound heal progress evaluate objectively use digital planimetry analysis system blind evaluator . Secondary objective include adverse event , bacterial load , expression inflammatory marker , cost military patient satisfaction assessment ,</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Healthy adult male nonlactating female age 18 60 year inclusive . 2 . Diagnosis pilonidal disease cyst require surgery , undermine remove cyst require limited excision heal secondary intension . 3 . Presence chronic symptomatic pilonidal disease define least one pilonidal sinus history least two acute pilonidal abscesses persistent symptom alter patient 's quality life . 4 . Military active duty member need supervisor sign memorandum participate ( Active Duty Supervisor 's Approval Memo ) . 5 . Understands purpose risk study score 80 % high knowledge assessment test . 6 . Available willing participate duration study ( approximately 30270 day maximum depending time wound heal ) . 7 . Available willing provide write informed consent . 8 . Able willing follow instruction per protocol . 9 . Available visit per protocol . Post Surgery Study Enrollment Criteria 10 . Postsurgical wound measurement ( length x width x depth ) : ( cm x 1.5 cm x 1.5 cm ) great equal 3 cm length , great equal 1.5 cm width , great equal to1.5 cm depth . Rationale : satisfies minimum size wound NPWT may employ . 1 . Does meet inclusion criterion . 2 . Pregnant ( history ascertain pregnancy test ) lactate female Rationale : immune modulation potential alter heal trajectory well operative risk fetus elective procedure . 3 . Known HIV infection . 4 . Known immunodeficiency currently receive immunosuppressive therapy ( inhaled topical steroid allow ) . 5 . Autoimmune disease ( clinical , preexist antidsDNA antibody 30 IU , positive ANA ELISA titer great 1:80 preoperative screening ) Exclusionary medical history include follow diagnosis : systemic lupus erythematosus , rheumatoid arthritis , mixed connective tissue disease , progressive systemic sclerosis , Sjogren 's syndrome , polymyositis/ dermatomyositis , vasculitis Rationale : potential alter wound heal . 6 . Acute chronic , clinically significant cardiac , pulmonary , hepatic , renal abnormality , determine physical examination basic laboratory screening perform preoperative evaluation . 7 . Known documented history diabetes mellitus . 8 . Nonambulatory limited mobility . Rationale : non ambulatory patient may alter wound heal sacral area due constant pressure positioning . 9 . History current tobacco use : define cigarette smoke great equal one half pack ( 10 cigarette ) per day : Rationale : confounding factor prolong wound heal . 10 . Complex pilonidal disease determine surgeon require procedure study procedure appropriate treatment disease . 11 . Acute pilonidal abscess infection within 6 week plan operative date . 12 . Concerns arterial bleed cancer wound bed vicinity dressing . 13 . Any significant finding , opinion investigator , would increase subject 's risk adverse outcome participate protocol . 14 . Lack unwillingness provide/sign inform consent . Post Surgery Exclusion Study Criteria 15 . Postsurgical wound measurement restriction ( enth x width x depth ) : ( 0 cm x 10 cm x 6 cm ) great equal 10 cm length , great equal 10 cm width OR great equal 6 cm depth . If bone visible expose , subject must exclude . Rationale : large wound deem complex wound expose visible bone require antibiotic therapy .</criteria>
