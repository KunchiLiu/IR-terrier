	<detailed_description>This protocol post amend reflect change Amendment 1 Protocol ( 20 April 2014 ) . Rationale Protocol Amendment 1 : • In order ass whether protection maintain time , assess boostability , protocol amend incorporate another sporozoite challenge , single boost 1/5th standard dose RTS , S/AS01B , boost . Study design : - Dependent upon enrolment date screening period , study duration approximately 19 month vaccinate subject delay fractional dose group , 14 month vaccinate subject 0 , 1 , 2-month group , 7 month infectivity control subject challenge phase 6 month infectivity control subject rechallenge phase . - Vaccination schedule : - 0 , 1 , 7-month follow sporozoite challenge 21 day ( 3 week ) third vaccination , subsequent boosting/no boost Booster Phase Study Day 0 follow sporozoite rechallenge 3 week post boost/no boost . - 0 , 1 , 2-month follow sporozoite challenge 21 day ( 3 week ) third vaccination , subsequent boosting/no boost Booster Phase Study Day 0 follow sporozoite rechallenge 3 week post boost/no boost . - Safety immunogenicity evaluate study 3 month rechallenge ( Booster Phase Study Day 105 ) . - Treatment allocation : - Non-randomized primary phase ; subject enrol different study group consecutive manner , ensure day sporozoite challenge ( conduct two day ) . - For booster rechallenge phase , subject unprotected first challenge receive 1/5th RTS , S/AS01B booster dose subject group protect first challenge randomized receive 1/5th RTS , S/AS01B booster dose booster dose . This protocol post amend reflect change Amendment 2 Protocol ( 08 January 2015 ) Rationale Protocol Amendment 2 : In order sufficient blood sample future assay development testing , evaluation Hepatitis B ( HBs ) cellular-mediated immunogenicity ( CMI ) de-prioritised secondary outcome measure tertiary secondary outcome measure conduct sufficient cell available thawn cryotube ( ) use circumsporozoite protein ( CS ) testing .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion enrolment primary phase : Subjects , opinion investigator , comply requirement protocol . A male nonpregnant female 18 50 year age time first vaccination . Written inform consent obtain subject screening procedure . Free obvious health problem establish medical history clinical examination enter study . Available participate duration study ( approximately 15 month per vaccinate subject delay fractional dose group , approximately 10 month per vaccinate subject 0 , 1 , 2month schedule approximately 7 month per subject infectivity control group ) . Female subject nonchildbearing potential may enrol study . Nonchildbearing potential define premenarche , current tubal ligation , hysterectomy , ovariectomy postmenopause . Female subject childbearing potential may enrol study , subject : practiced adequate FDAapproved contraception 30 day prior vaccination , negative pregnancy test day vaccination , agree continue adequate FDAapproved contraception entire treatment period 2 month completion vaccination series and/or malaria challenge . Inclusion criterion enrolment booster phase : Subjects , opinion investigator , comply requirement protocol . Written inform consent obtain subject screening procedure . Subjects vaccinate primary phase study ( applicable new infectivity control ) , undergone sporozoite challenge primary phase study . Available participate duration booster phase study ( approximately 3 month ) . Female subject nonchildbearing potential may enrol study . Nonchildbearing potential define premenarche , current tubal ligation , hysterectomy , ovariectomy postmenopause . Female subject childbearing potential may enrol booster phase study , subject : practiced adequate FDAapproved contraception 30 day prior day booster vaccination , negative pregnancy test day booster vaccination , agree continue adequate FDAapproved contraception entire treatment period 2 month completion booster vaccination and/or malaria rechallenge . For enrolment primary &amp; booster phase : Any confirm suspected immunosuppressive immunodeficient condition , include immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection . Acute disease and/or fever time enrolment booster phase . Acute disease define presence moderate severe illness without fever . Subjects minor illness without fever may enrol discretion investigator . Fever define temperature ≥ 38.0°C ( 100.4°F ) oral , axillary tympanic setting . The preferred route record temperature study oral . Acute chronic , clinically significant pulmonary , cardiovascular , hepatic renal functional abnormality , determine physical examination laboratory screen test . Evidence increase cardiovascular disease risk , `` moderate '' `` high '' , accord National health nutrition examination survey I ( NHANES I ) criterion . Note : NHANES I criteria applied subject include subject age 1835 year old . An abnormal baseline screen electrocardiogram ( EKG ) , define one show pathologic Q wave significant STT wave change ; leave ventricular hypertrophy ; nonsinus rhythm exclude isolated premature atrial contraction ; right leave bundle branch block ; advance AV heart block . Female intend become pregnant study planning discontinue contraceptive measure . For enrolment primary phase : Use investigational nonregistered product study vaccine within 30 day precede first dose study vaccine , plan use study period . Planned administration/administration vaccine foreseen study protocol within 7 day first dose vaccine . Prior receipt investigational malaria vaccine . Chronic use antibiotic antimalarial effect . History malaria chemoprophylaxis within 60 day prior vaccination . Any history malaria . Planned travel malaria endemic area study period . History allergic disease reaction likely exacerbate component vaccine ( ) include latex . History allergic disease reaction likely exacerbate chloroquine . History psoriasis porphyria , may exacerbate chloroquine treatment . Current use medication know cause drug reaction chloroquine . Any history anaphylaxis reaction previous vaccination . History severe reaction mosquito bite . Administration immunoglobulins and/or blood product within three month precede first dose study vaccine plan administration study period . Chronic administration immunosuppressant immune modify drug within six month prior first vaccine dose . For corticosteroid , mean prednisone , equivalent , great equal 20 mg/day . Inhaled topical steroid allow . Family history congenital hereditary immunodeficiency . History splenectomy . Major congenital defect serious chronic illness . History neurological disorder seizure , except single episode simple febrile seizure childhood . Any abnormal baseline laboratory screen test : Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , creatinine , hemoglobin , platelet count , total white blood cell count , normal range define protocol . Hepatomegaly , right upper quadrant abdominal pain tenderness . Personal history autoimmune disease . Seropositive hepatitis B surface antigen Hepatitis C virus . Pregnant lactate female . Suspected known current alcohol abuse . Chronic active intravenous drug use . History blood donation within 56 day precede enrolment . Any significant finding opinion investigator would increase risk adverse outcome participate study . For enrolment booster phase : Planned use investigational nonregistered product study vaccine study period . Planned administration/administration vaccine foreseen study protocol within 7 day booster dose study vaccine . Planned administration immunoglobulins and/or blood product study period . An abnormal baseline laboratory screen test , grade 2 define protocol . Any abnormal baseline laboratory screen test normal range define protocol clinical concern accord Principal Investigator . Any significant finding opinion investigator would increase risk adverse outcome participate booster phase study .</criteria>
