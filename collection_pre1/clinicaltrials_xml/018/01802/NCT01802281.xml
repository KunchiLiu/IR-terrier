	<brief_summary>The primary purpose randomize clinical trial compare effectiveness safety two transvaginal apical suspension strategy uterovaginal prolapse : mesh augment hysteropexy versus vaginal hysterectomy uterosacral ligament suspension ( USLS ) . The primary aim determine whether treatment success woman undergo strategy differ time point 3 year . A supplemental study investigate anterior vaginal wall movement result descent rotation vaginal apex and/or anterior vaginal elongation , woman study arm SUPeR .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Uterine Prolapse Procedures - Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study population adult woman ( &gt; 21 year age ) symptomatic uterovaginal prolapse beyond hymen desire vaginal surgical management . This study intend do woman complete child-bearing inactive uterus , define amenorrhea 1 year . Therefore woman postmenopausal amenorrhea endometrial ablation . Amenorrhea cause exogenous steroid , hypothalamic disorder allow inclusion . Participants obtain clinic population eight Pelvic Floor Disorders Network ( PFDN ) sit . Participants randomly assign either vaginal hysterectomy USLS mesh hysteropexy suspension treatment uterovaginal prolapse . The surgical assignment reveal operating room , participant anesthesia . Participants follow least 36-months ( 3-years ) post surgery maximum 60-months ( 5-years ) . Follow-up data obtain in-person clinic visit , study staff mask surgical assignment primary person obtain follow-up data . Although primary study outcome depend mask participant blind evaluator , several important participant report secondary aim subject report bias participant aware study assignment . Therefore , study participant , coordinator , nurse mask study assignment . Study surgeon anatomic evaluator unmask . Evaluators conduct POPQ exam co-investigator , fellow qualify nurse perform study surgery . Surgical failure rate compare use survival analysis approach appropriate interval censor data ( classic log-rank test survival model use generalized linear model approach complementary log-log link ) secondary outcomes report rate group group mean evaluate appropriate parametric nonparametric statistical test . Throughout study , PFDN Data Safety Monitoring Committee ( DSMB ) review study data decide study continue . Additionally , study adhere CONSORT guideline perform report randomize controlled trial ( Begg et al 1996 ) . Women eligible decline enrollment characterize manner consistent CONSORT requirement .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Women age 21 older complete child bear 2 . Prolapse beyond hymen ( define Ba , Bp , C &gt; 0 cm ) 3 . Uterine descent least low half vagina ( define point C &gt; TVL/2 ) ) 4 . Bothersome bulge symptom indicate question 3 PFDI20 form relate 'sensation bulge ' 'something fall ' 5 . Desires vaginal surgical treatment uterovaginal prolapse 6 . Available 60 month followup 7 . Amenorrhea past 12 month either menopause endometrial ablation 8 . Not pregnant , risk pregnancy agree contraception risk pregnancy ( applicable rare endometrial ablation patient ) 9 . Eligible cervical cancer screen least 3 year 1 . Previous synthetic material ( place vaginally abdominally ) augment POP repair 2 . Known previous uterosacral sacrospinous uterine suspension 3 . Known adverse reaction synthetic mesh biological graft ; complication include limited erosion , fistula , abscess 4 . Chronic pelvic pain 5 . Pelvic radiation 6 . Cervical elongation define expectation C point would Stage 2 great postoperatively hysteropexy perform . ( Note : cervical shorten trachelectomy allow intraoperative procedure within hysteropexy treatment group ) . 7 . Women increase risk cervical dysplasia require cervical cancer screen often every 3 year ( e.g . HIV+ status , immunosuppression transplant related medication , Diethylstilbestrol ( DES ) exposure utero , previous treatment cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ( CIN ) 2 , CIN3 , cancer ) 8 . Uterine abnormality ( symptomatic uterine fibroid , polyp , endometrial hyperplasia , endometrial cancer , uterine disease preclude prolapse repair uterine preservation opinion surgeon 9 . Indication ovarian removal ( adnexal mass , BRCA 1/2 positivity , family history ovarian cancer ) 10 . Current condition amenorrhea cause exogenous sex steroid hypothalamic condition .</criteria>
