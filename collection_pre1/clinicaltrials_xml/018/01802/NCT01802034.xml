	<brief_summary>A central goal data repository collect data large population subject variety renal disease state . Cohorts include subject diabetes , inflammatory/autoimmune transplant relate renal condition . Additionally , repository capacity store biospecimens electronic data control subject without establish renal disease . This initiative provide opportunity compare data various disease state control objective determine clinical biological factor predict disease progression , response therapy identify discriminate noninvasive clinical biological feature predict renal biopsy finding .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Repository Novel Analytes Leading Autoimmune , Inflammatory Diabetic Nephropathies ( RENAL AID )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RENAL AID design inclusive data tissue repository capable link demographic , clinical , laboratory , histology , genetic radiographic data one interconnected electronic data collection instrument . It hypothesize link typically disconnect data component single electronic repository , RENAL AID capable discover relationship otherwise disparate data set order ascertain previously unknown factor association contribute progression disease , incidence complication ( include renal failure ) response therapy . Further , certain pattern inflammatory and/or immune mediator present serum , whole blood urine subject renal disease may predictive underlie histopathology present renal biopsy specimen . The potential correlation non-invasive marker underlie histopathology subject undergoing renal biopsy may afford ability make renal diagnosis non-invasively future . RENAL AID obtain follow clinical data large number subject variety ethnic , social economic background follow three research subject group : 1 . Native Biopsy Tissue Group : This group consist subject expectant renal biopsy undertaken base upon clinical necessity surplus tissue available . Subjects enrol group evaluate every 3 month first year follow biopsy , annually thereafter . Research whole blood , serum urine obtain visit . 2 . Native kidney , non-tissue group : This group consist subject undergone renal biopsy without specimen storage RENAL AID biorepository and/or subject diabetes concurrent kidney disease absence renal biopsy . Subjects enrol group evaluate annually . Research whole blood , serum urine obtain visit . 3 . Allograft tissue group : This group consist subject undergone renal transplant require transplant biopsy either surveillance ( term protocol biopsy ) `` for-cause '' indication . By definition , `` for-cause '' biopsy perform unexpected clinical event occur warrant transplant biopsy . Such event include acute graft dysfunction , progressive decline transplant function , proteinuria hematuria . Subjects group evaluate time transplant biopsy research whole blood , serum urine obtain visit . Additionally , RENAL AID design biospecimen data repository objective conduct wide variety diverse research base upon data tissue collect , research investigation control subject necessary . In anticipation requirement , RENAL AID ability record clinical , laboratory histology data control subject manner research subject study obligate control group ability store bio-specimens tissue manner research subject . In circumstance , control subject consent RENAL AID store electronic data biopspecimens per protocol .</detailed_description>
