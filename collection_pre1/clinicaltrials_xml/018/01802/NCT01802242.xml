	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer common male may develop course individual 's life . This cancer often discover time routine physical examination and/or blood work rectal examination . Once diagnosed , patient require form treatment prostate cancer progress cause damage and/or shorten lifespan . Occasionally , patient receive treatment , investigator find area cancer remain within prostate . Those patient large area cancer ( i.e . see MRI image ) appear high chance remain recurrent prostate cancer even standard treatment . Thus , investigator believe area prostate gland occupy dense area cancer may need radiation therapy normal remain cancer free . Standard therapy currently place North America : Currently patient diagnose prostate cancer 3 common option : surgery , external beam radiation therapy ( EBRT ) alone internal radiation ( brachytherapy ) . Patients may may receive hormone therapy alongside radiation depend physician 's preference . For receive radiation therapy , tumor typically receive dose rest prostate gland . Findings date : In past year investigator discover patient tumor large enough see MRI image ( &gt; 5mm ) high chance normal cancer remain prostate , despite receive treatment cancer 3 year earlier . Using new technology investigator deliver radiation therapy view prostate tumor MRI . This guide therapy , allow radiation treatment target tumor within prostate . Based early success investigator believe safely give high dose radiation specifically target cancer within prostate gland . Reason study : The investigator would like test technology expertise give radiation high normal dose tumor nodule prostate gland .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective two arm phase 2 trial investigate technical clinical performance tumor-targeted ( rather prostate target ) radiotherapy . Cohort 1 ( Control group ) : This group consist patient previous radiation . This group receive active treatment biopsy 3 year time complete radiation therapy . Patient group also continue PSA check per standard practice Cohort 2 ( Experimental group ) : Patients group receive one 2 treatment arm choice . In addition MRI-guided prostate biopsy 3 year regular standard care PSA check , group also complete quality life questionnaire regular image per standard practice . Both group follow research team per protocol .</detailed_description>
