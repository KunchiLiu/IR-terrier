	<detailed_description>This randomize controlled pilot trial two intention-to-treat treatment arm : intensive periodontal therapy control-delayed periodontal therapy . The investigator ' goal test feasibility conduct trial among underserved ( mostly poor low literacy ) population determine variability renal inflammatory biomarkers response intensive periodontal therapy 12 month period among participant chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) significant periodontal disease . Randomization restrict respect diabetes ( strong risk factor causing/aggravating CKD periodontal disease ) prevent imbalance two arm . The investigator recruit 51 patient San Francisco General Hospital ( SFGH ) Renal Clinic . Participants assign 2:1 intervention group intensive periodontal treatment protocol ( n=34 ) control/delayed treatment group rescue periodontal treatment intensive treatment end study ( n=17 ) . Hypothesis : A large scale randomize controlled trial intensive periodontal treatment among underserved feasible ( respect enrollment , randomization , adherence variability clinical outcome ) . Specific Aims : 1 . To assess feasibility recruit patient pilot trial . 2 . To determine variability kidney biomarkers response periodontal disease treatment . Statistical Analysis : The investigator calculate descriptive statistic ( mean , standard deviation ) clinical outcome include traditional marker kidney function ( serum creatinine ) , marker kidney structure [ glomerular injury ( albuminuria ) tubular injury ( neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) ) ] ; marker vascular endothelial injury ( asymmetrical dimethylarginine ( ADMA ) ) ; marker systemic inflammation ( IL-6 C-reactive protein ) measure baseline , study month 4 , study month 12 . The investigator use repeated-measures generalize estimate equation ( GEE ) compare change clinical outcome time within treatment group compare difference treatment group take individual change time account . Sample Size Calculation : This pilot study . To investigator ' knowledge , exist data anticipate effect size periodontal treatment inform sample size calculation . However , primary aim determine variability various renal inflammatory biomarkers , investigator seek enroll least 30 subject intervention arm trial .</detailed_description>
