	<brief_title>Akt Inhibitor MK2206 Treating Patients With Previously Treated Colon Rectal Cancer That Metastatic Locally Advanced Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate MK-2206 ( Akt inhibitor MK2206 ) , define complete response ( CR ) + partial response ( PR ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate MK-2206 patient phosphatase tensin homolog ( PTEN ) loss phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase , catalytic subunit alpha ( PIK3CA ) mutation pretreatment biopsy metastatic site . II . To determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . III . To determine time treatment failure ( TTF ) , duration tumor response ( DR ) . IV . To determine safety profile tolerability regimen patient population . V. To determine effect PTEN , v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 ( BRAF ) , PIK3CA , AKT mutation semi-quantitative grade PTEN expression clinical response . OUTLINE : Patients receive Akt inhibitor MK2206 orally ( PO ) day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 24 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month .</detailed_description>
