	<brief_title>Comparison 2 Immunomodulator Withdrawal Schemes Infliximab Monotherapy Active Pediatric Crohn 's Disease After Thiopurine Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Current data study registries involve pediatric Crohn 's disease indicate 50-80 % child receive immunomodulator ( IMM ) maintenance therapy within 12 month diagnosis , 60-80 % 18 month . The common use IMM early disease also lead high proportion patient active disease despite IMM ( IMMfailure ) . Infliximab become standard care North America , Europe Israel , recommend present steroid dependent refractory patient , fistulizing disease , active disease despite immunomodulator . Infliximab originally prescribe add therapy IMM , concern regard IFX side effect loss response due development antibody infliximab ( ATIs ) . An early study clearly show advantage long term remission thiopurine co administration.However , subsequent study adults CD show scheduled IFX treatment , AZA could safely discontinue first 6 month therapy , lower risk associate dual immunosuppressive therapy , risk co-therapy . Monotherapy subsequently become recommended method treatment IFX , despite decrease trough level among discontinue IMM . IFX mono-therapy become method choice treatment pediatric CD , though strategy call question due frequent loss response IFX require dose escalation IFX decrease interval IFX . This loss response attribute development ATIs low trough level IFX , develop first infusion . Low trough level infliximab 14 week predictive LOR . The second reason question IFX mono-therapy trial compare mono-therapy combine AZA+IFX therapy adult moderate severe thiopurine naïve disease . This study clearly show improve long term remission rate mucosal heal unselected cohort patient combination therapy . Conversely , mono-therapy associate low level sustain mucosal heal , troublesome . Lastly , excellent result obtain pediatric cohort treat combined therapy , along relatively low risk HTSCL , leave pediatric gastroenterologist loss ; Should recommend primary mono-therapy , use IMM limit period time discontinue therapy ? When IMM discontinue , first infusion several month ? There control data pediatric IBD answer press question . There also movement towards increase use methotrexate instead thiopurines immunomodulators concern neoplasia . Recent study show add immunomodulator biologic LOR , trough level improve ATIs ADAs decrease , suggest IMM may inhibit antibody formation . The investigator hypothesize continue IMM IFX first 6 month , investigator detect benefit . The investigator hypothesize early cessation IMM increase risk LOR ( Loss response ) , decrease trough level 14 week , associate low rate corticosteroid free sustain remission one year . In parallel study , use data base , We also hypothesize low trough level week 14 ( parallel study ) predict LOR- This study , call Predict Study ; Prediction Loss Response Infliximab Crohn 's Disease Based Week 14 Trough Levels.will enable open label enrolment patient receive infliximab immunomodulator , require randomization , patient may allocate group one group 2 physician patient discretion . Methods : It prospective open label phase 4 RCT pediatric patient active CD , define Porto criterion , despite &gt; 10 week prior treatment immunomodulator ( thiopurines/Methotrexate ) , require infliximab , involve 2 arm , intention treat analysis first infusion .</detailed_description>
