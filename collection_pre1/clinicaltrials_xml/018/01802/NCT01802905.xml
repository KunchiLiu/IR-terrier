	<brief_summary>Most systemic therapy choose basis large randomize clinical trial ; however , tumour heterogeneity mean cancer similar histological feature may substantially different underlie biological driver . The investigator propose apply personal genomic information prospectively obtain clinically realistic timeframe assist chemotherapy decision-making could result effective efficient cancer treatment . This study investigate approach cross section advance cancer examine timeliness , deliverability , rate actionable target identify , ability expand approach large clinical trial setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Utilization Genomic Information Augment Chemotherapy Decision-making People With Incurable Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It clear carcinogenesis immensely complex process even within histologic cancer subtype - adenocarcinoma lung breast - significant heterogeneity cancer behaviour response therapy . Recognizing genetic mutation promote disease facilitates target treatment ; demonstrate several small subgroup cancer specific genetic mutation translocation successfully treat targeted chemotherapy agent . Analyses individual patient demonstrate unique molecular signature every cancer examine . Frequently , multiple different pathway involve disease growth progression dominant process varies person person perhaps even within different site disease within one person . As well variation evolve response treatment . With many recognize mutation personalize evaluation genetic signature encode DNA RNA may enable directed therapy appropriate oncologic pathway thereby provide information help guide chemotherapy choice .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Subjects must histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis cancer 2 . This cancer must incurable , define treat oncologist ( generally advance stage ) . 3 . Subjects must agree provide archival tissue agree undergo study specific biopsy blood test genetic analysis . All subject would biopsy blood sample progression could do safely . 4 . ECOG PS 0 1 . 5 . Age &gt; 18 year age . 6 . Subject consent must obtain accord BCCA requirement . 7 . Subject must accessible treatment followup . Subjects must register BCCA Vancouver site . 1 . Unable unwilling undergo tumour biopsy ( ) and/or blood/skin sample normal DNA . 2 . Significant medical condition opinion treat oncologist render subject suitable participation .</criteria>
