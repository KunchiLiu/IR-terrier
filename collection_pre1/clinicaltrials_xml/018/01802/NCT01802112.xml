	<brief_title>Randomised Controlled Trial Efficacy Resistant Maltodextrins Reducing Colonic Transit Time</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In last fifty year drastically change eat habit , particular fibre intake . Our hunter-gatherer ancestor eat 100 specie fruit vegetable , contribute 20 30 g dietary fibre per day . Currently , typical citizen country reach 10 % amount . Therefore , fibre deficiency alters digestion metabolism , increase nutrient absorption ( obesity , increase insulin resistance , hyperlipidaemia ) , produce altered colonic metabolism ( inflammatory bowel disease ) , slow faecal transit ( increase lumen pressure diverticulosis , appendicitis , haemorrhoid colon cancer . In addition , prebiotic effect important . Several study demonstrate effectiveness digestion-resistant maltodextrin treatment chronic idiopathic constipation . Investigators carry single blind study among young people constipation administer 9.2 gram resistant maltodextrins per day placebo , find significant change defecation frequency faecal volume . Kimura et al . carry clinical trial woman constipation defecation frequency le 3 time per week administer 5 gram resistant maltodextrins per day , demonstrate effectiveness significantly increase number defecation per week , number day per week without defecation faecal volume . Additionally , improvement find aspect colour , stool odour psychological feeling defecation . Finally , interesting feature Resistant maltodextrins normalises colonic transit time without cause diarrhoea , whilst increase stool volume , moisture frequency defecation . The purpose study assess efficacy resistant maltodextrins , compare placebo , reduce colonic transit time healthy subject . For That , 60 subject stratify gender ( 30 woman : 15 resistant maltodextrins 15 placebo 30 men : 15 resistant maltodextrins 15 placebo ) .</detailed_description>
