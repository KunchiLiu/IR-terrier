	<brief_title>Prevalence POU4F3 SLC17A8 Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DFNA characterize progressive bilateral deafness . To date , 21 gene 57 locus involve dominant deafness , unknown prevalence.A 22nd gene responsible disease find . This SLC17A8 gene encodes VGLUT3 protein specifically express sensorial cell audition . VGlut3-/- mice present deep deafness due deficiency neurotransmitter release , although sensorial cell neuron intact . This kind deafness ideal candidate genetic therapy cell integrity.Mutations SLC17A8 gene find 2 american family suffer progressive deafness.The study aim look european family Mediterranean basin , carry SLC17A8 gene mutation , may benefit medium-term genetic therapy . The study allow identify prevalence SLC17A8 gene mutation patient suffer deafness . This phenotype also correspond DFNA15 deafness cause POU4F3 : mutation gene screen well .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age &gt; 18 year Patients 1. suggestive neurosensory Deafness : The characteristic deafness determine data questionnaire , interrogation , examination result tonal audiometry . *Neurosensory deafness : Audiometrics measurement ( difference tonal audiometric average loss frequencies 0,5 , 1 , 2 4 kHz air conduction osseous conduction ) &lt; 15 dB ear . Bilateral symetric : difference audiometric threshold ear &lt; = 15 dB least two frequency . Light severe : The degree deafness define accord follow classification ( moderate hearing loss calculate frequency 500 Hz , 1 , 2 4 kHz ) : light hear deficiency 20 40 dB , moderate hearing deficiency 40 70 dB , severe hearing deficiency 70 90 dB deep hearing deficiency beyond 90 dB . Whose thresholds frequency frequency tonal audiometry ( air conduction ) superior threshold 90th percentile standard ISO 7029 . Without environmental exposition factor . 2 . Dominant autosomal transmission diagnose one follow element : Deafness father son Deafness father daughter outside suggestive context dominant form Xrelated . ( deep deafness father light moderate deafness daughter ) Deafness mother daughter Deafness mother son outside suggestive context dominant Xrelated ( light moderate deafness mother , deep deafness son ) Deafness patient whose dead parent sure likely deafness accord criterion diagnosis mention previously 3. give consent participate clinical study Suggestive symptom polymalformative syndrom familial Consanguinity Age &lt; 18 year Deafness transmission mix Deafness asymmetric fluctuate perception Prelingual deep Deafness Pathology ear ( otospongiose , disease Ménière , neurinome acoustic )</criteria>
