	<brief_summary>Following deployment 1991 Gulf War , many veteran ( GWV ) report constellation unexplained health symptom ; common among attention memory difficulty , fatigue , joint pain , headache , gastrointestinal complaint , mood sleep problem . Despite passage time , symptom complex persist many veteran . Indeed , estimate least 25 percent GWV ( nearly 170,000 veteran ) persistent form chronic multisymptom illness ( CMI ) . GW deploy veteran also develop significantly chronic disease diabetes , hypertension , arthritis , coronary heart disease non-deployed veteran peer put individual risk accelerate aging-related disease peripheral central nervous system ( CNS ) . Recent study show slow response speed affect mental flexibility across multiple cognitive domain ( memory , attention , visuospatial function ) especially test timed computerized small difference cognitive reaction time could measure . Recent study also suggest response inhibition deficit show GWV may reflect executive system dysfunction reflect slow motor response across multiple cognitive domain . To date , treatment show improve health cognitive difficulty GW veteran ; thus urgent need establish effective , safe , tolerable treatment GW CMI . Previous study cognitive disorder find intranasal insulin improve memory , attention , mood , reduce neuroinflammation , modulate cortisol level ; also identify treatment capacity alter many lead problem GW CMI . During study 2 treatment group placebo group last 8 week . The treatment group self-administer designate dosage insulin nasal pump twice day , placebo group administer saline nasal pump twice day . These dos show effective safe . The primary outcome measure ass improvement verbal delayed memory use specific list learn task measure selective attention . The study assess improvement overall physical health mood ask participant complete self report questionnaire . Neuroendocrine measure also obtain order evaluate change glucose , insulin , cortisol level examine impact GW CMI . Intranasal insulin show great promise improve memory , attention , mood old adult cognitive impairment well normal subject . Thus , proposal could prove intranasal insulin effective , safe , affordable therapy ail veteran .</brief_summary>
