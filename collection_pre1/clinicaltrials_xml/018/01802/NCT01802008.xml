	<brief_summary>The objective study determine optimal withdrawal time colonoscopy . A 6-minute withdrawal time currently standard care evaluate observational fashion . The investigator believe validate standardized fashion . If benefit 6 minute withdrawal proven study ( ie low polyp/adenoma miss rate high polyp/adenoma detection rate ) , support widespread adoption 6 minute withdrawal standard care . This turn may decrease occurence 'interval colon cancer ' , early colon cancer arise subject despite undergone colonoscopy . Our hypothesis polyp/adenoma detection rate unacceptably low polyp/adenoma miss rate unacceptably high 3-minute withdrawal group compare 6-minute withdrawal group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eligible patient randomize colonoscopy either 6-minute withdrawal time 3-minute withdrawal time . Patients undergo colonoscopy . All colonoscopy perform GI attend ( standard care ) . The colonoscopy typically perform conscious sedation use medication fentanyl midazolam comfort ( standard care ) . Occasional patient undergo colonoscopy general anesthesia . For patient , advancement colonoscope cecum follow segmental withdrawal colonoscope 3 segment examine colon ( right side colon , transverse colon leave side colon ) . Following examination individual segment , colonoscope readvanced proximal end segment 2 minute withdrawal re-performed . For randomized 6-minute withdrawal segment examine 2 minute , follow `` second look '' segment 2 minute endoscopist . For randomized 3-minute withdrawal time , advancement cecum also follow segmental withdrawal 3 segment examine colon . Each segment examine 1 minute , follow `` second look '' segment 2 minute endoscopist . All patient therefore undergo second look colonoscopy 6-minute withdrawal time ( 'de-facto ' standard care ) . Polyp/adenoma detection miss rate calculate compare two group .</detailed_description>
