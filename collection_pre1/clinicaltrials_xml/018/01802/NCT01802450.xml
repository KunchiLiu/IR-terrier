	<brief_title>Dasatinib Patients With Chronic Myeloid Leukemia Chronic Phase</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-arm , open-label , phase II trial patient complete cytogenetic response achieve major molecular response lose prior major molecular response , least 18 month treatment imatinib . All enrol patient receive dasatinib 100 mg daily orally 1 year progression , loss cytogenetic response , transformation advance phase , unacceptable toxicity ( clinical adverse event , lab abnormality concurrent disease ) , pregnancy female withdrawal consent , whichever happen first . Patients undergo BCR-ABL assessment study entry every 3 month ( central lab ) immunophenotyping study clonal lymphocytosis study entry , 3 6 month . Cytogenetic assessment do loss response/progression/clonal evolution suspect . Subjects evaluate efficacy safety dasatinib ( Sprycel ) . Lymphocytosis data collect patient separate description efficacy safety parameter do patient without lymphocytosis .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult patient &gt; = 18 year Diagnostic Ph+ Chronic Myeloid Leukemia first chronic phase Treated Imatinib 400 mg per day 600 mg per day least 18 month . A wash period least 7 day imatinib required prior dasatinib administration Patients meet criterion late suboptimal response ( complete cytogenetic response major molecular response ) lose major molecular response Ability understand voluntarily sign informed consent Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) must use adequate method contraception avoid pregnancy negative pregnancy test , maximum 72 hour prior study drug start . Sexually active men must also use effective contraceptive method treatment . Women must breastfeed Patients treat Imatinib dose different 400/600 mg per day Patients treat TKI imatinib Loss cytogenetic response study entry ECOG â‰¥ 3 Inadequate bone marrow reserve : ANC &lt; 1.5 x 109/L and/or Platelet count &lt; 100 x 109/L Inadequate hepatic function ( Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) and/or aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) &gt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal ( IULN ) .
