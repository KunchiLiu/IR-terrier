	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study cytarabine daunorubicin hydrochloride idarubicin cytarabine without vorinostat see well work treat young patient previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia . Drugs use chemotherapy , cytarabine , daunorubicin hydrochloride , idarubicin , vorinostat , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving one drug ( combination chemotherapy ) give drug different dos different combination may kill cancer cell . It yet know combination chemotherapy effective treat acute myeloid leukemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cytarabine Daunorubicin Hydrochloride Idarubicin Cytarabine With Without Vorinostat Treating Younger Patients With Previously Untreated Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare event-free survival ( EFS ) patient acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) receive standard 7+3 ( cytarabine daunorubicin hydrochloride ) idarubicin high-dose cytarabine ( IA ) patient receive IA + vorinostat . ( Chemotherapy ) II . To determine whether possible get 60 % adult high-risk AML ( cytogenetics ) first complete remission ( CR1 ) allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation ( HCT ) . ( Transplant ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate frequency severity toxicity three regimen patient population . ( Chemotherapy ) II . To estimate disease-free survival ( DFS ) among patient receive transplant . ( Transplant ) III . To compare event-free survival ( EFS ) patient receive standard 7 + 3 patient receive IA . ( Chemotherapy ) IV . To estimate prevalence mutation nucleophosmin ( nucleolar phosphoprotein B23 , numatrin ) ( NPM1 ) , isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 ( NADP+ ) , soluble ( IDH1 ) , isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 ( NADP+ ) , mitochondrial ( IDH2 ) , tet methylcytosine dioxygenase 2 ( TET2 ) deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) ( cytosine-5- ) -methyltransferase 3 alpha ( DNMT3A ) cytogenetic risk distribution patient study evaluate association overall survival ( OS ) , event-free survival ( EFS ) , disease-free survival ( DFS ) , complete remission rate . ( Chemotherapy/Translational Medicine ) V. To compare complete response rate , disease-free survival ( DFS ) , overall survival ( OS ) patient receive standard 7+3 therapy IA patient receive IA + vorinostat . ( Chemotherapy ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Future plan study include test histone H3 acetylation , induction gamma H2A histone family , member X ( H2AX ) , analysis reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) resistance DNA methylation profile . ( Chemotherapy/Translational Medicine ) OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . INDUCTION/RE-INDUCTION : ARM I : Patients receive standard dose cytarabine intravenously ( IV ) continuously day 1-7 daunorubicin hydrochloride IV day 1-3 . Patients residual blast may receive re-induction treatment begin day 15 . Patients achieve complete remission ( CR ) complete remission incomplete platelet recover ( CRi ) may proceed allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) consolidation therapy . ARM II : Patients receive high dose cytarabine IV continuously day 1-4 idarubicin IV 15 minute day 1-3 . Patients residual blast may receive re-induction treatment begin day 28 . Patients achieve CR CRi may proceed allogeneic HSCT consolidation therapy . ARM III : Patients receive vorinostat orally ( PO ) thrice daily ( TID ) day 1-3 , high-dose cytarabine IV continuously day 4-7 , idarubicin IV 15 minute day 4-6 . Patients residual blast may receive re-induction treatment begin day 28 . Patients achieve CR CRi may proceed allogeneic HSCT consolidation therapy . ( Permanently close accrual , effective 6/2/2015 ) Patient previously randomize Arm III may continue treatment without vorinostat . CONSOLIDATION : ARM I : Patients receive cytarabine IV 3 hour every 12 hour day 1 , 3 , 5 . ARM II : Patients receive cytarabine IV continuously day 1-3 idarubicin IV 15 minute day 1-2 . ARM III : Patients receive vorinostat PO TID day 1-3 , cytarabine IV continuously day 4-6 , idarubicin IV 15 minute day 4-5 . ( Permanently close accrual , effective 6/2/2015 ) Patient previously randomize Arm III may continue treatment without vorinostat . In arm , treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course transplant absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . TRANSPLANT : Patients may undergo allogeneic transplant induction therapy consolidation therapy . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 2 year , annually 2 year .</detailed_description>
