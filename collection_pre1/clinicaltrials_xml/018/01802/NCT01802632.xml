	<brief_summary>This study treat patient advance NSCLC already receive least one course specific anti-cancer treatment tumour start re-grow following treatment . This first time drug ever test patient , help understand type side effect may occur drug treatment , measure level drug body , also measure anti-cancer activity . By use piece information together best dose drug use clinical trial select .</brief_summary>

Histological cytological confirmation diagnosis Non Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) . Radiological documentation disease progression previous continuous treatment EGFR TKI e.g . gefitinib erlotinib ( exception 1st line expansion cohort ) . In addition line therapy may give . All patient must document radiological progression last treatment administer prior enrol study . Patients ( exception 1st line expansion cohort ) must fulfil one following : Confirmation tumour harbour EGFR mutation know associated EGFR TKI sensitivity ( include G719X , exon 19 deletion , L858R , L861Q ) OR Must experience clinical benefit EGFR TKI , accord Jackman criterion ( Jackman et al 2010 ) follow systemic objective progression ( RECIST WHO ) continuous treatment EGFR TKI . Previous treatment singleagent EGFR TKI ( e.g . gefitinib erlotinib ) . Females use adequate contraceptive measure , breast feeding must negative pregnancy test prior start dose evidence nonchild bear potential . Male patient willing use barrier contraception . For 1st Line expansion cohort ONLY , confirmation tumour EGFRm+ve prior therapy advanced disease ( 1st line patient biopsy time diagnosis advance disease ) . For dose expansion extension cohort , patient must also confirmation tumour T790M mutation status ( confirm positive negative ) biopsy sample take disease progression recent treatment regimen ( irrespective whether EGFR TKI chemotherapy ) . Prior entry result central analysis patient 's T790M mutation status must obtain . World Health Organisation ( WHO ) performance status 01 deterioration previous 2 week minimum life expectancy 12 week . Treatment EGFR TKI ( erlotinib gefitinib ) within 8 day ( approximately 5x halflife ) first dose study treatment . Any cytotoxic chemotherapy , investigational agent anticancer drug treatment advance NSCLC previous treatment regimen clinical study within 14 day first dose study treatment .
