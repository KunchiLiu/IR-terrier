	<brief_title>Effect Astragalus-based Formula : Qingshu-Yiqi-Tang Modulating Immune Alterations Lung Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer lead cause mortality morbidity world . In Taiwan , lung cancer second cause cancer death men first woman . Although five-year survival rate early stage , operable non-small cell lung cancer patient range 60 % stage IA patient 15 % stage IIIA patient , 85 % patient advance inoperable stage diagnosis . Their medium survival around six nine month . New generation chemotherapy newly develop target therapy significantly prolong medium survival statistic range one three month , limited significance clinical practice , suggest limitation current modality treatment . Chinese herbal medicine long history show effectiveness benefit maintenance health recovery disease . Among , Astragalus-based Chinese herb show increase effectiveness platinum-based chemotherapy combine chemotherapy advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer . Despite fact many Chinese herbal medicine show pro-apoptotic effect tumor cell vitro , none demonstrate tumorocidal effect clinical practice , use alone . Moreover , Astragalus reveal anti-apoptotic effect cell , suggest non-tumorocidal function Astragalus formula benefit cancer therapy . Studies show external internal stimulus induce cell transformation . As result , dys-regulation cell growth , DNA repair , cell proliferation apotosis may occur . Normal commit tissue cell transform undifferentiated , multi-potential malignant cell . Normally , competent immune system recognize transform abnormal cell , undergo immune editing , activate cytotoxic cell eradicate abnormal cell , finally , prevent malignant cell transformation . But unknown mechanism , malignant cell may escape immune surveillance , release chemokines , growth factor mediator drive change inflammatory cell . Consequently , anti-tumor function immune cell suppress , lead environment favor development metastasis malignant cell . From experiment animal model observation malignancy , researcher suggest malignant cell release mediator , activate pre-myeloid suppressor promote myeloid-derived suppressor cell development . The myeloid-derived suppressor cell trigger cytotoxic T cell apoptosis , may shift macrophage toward M2 subtype , inhibit Th1 cell , initiate immune suppressive mechanism . The function NK cell regulatory T cell alter , result disturbance anti-tumor immune function . All create environment benefit malignant cell growth advancement . Astragalus-based formula may confer surval advantage cancer patient modulate immune system reverse immunosuppressive microenvironment . The lung cancer study Department Thoracic Medicine demonstrate myeloid-derived suppressor cell , cytotoxic T cell , Treg cell monocytes play critically important role mediate immune alteration patient advanced stage , non-small cell lung cancer . In three-year proposal , aim study role one Astragalus-based formula : Qingshu Yiqi Tang reverse immune alteration patient advanced stage , non-small cell lung cancer receive 1st line doublet chemotherapy cisplatin plus doxetaxel（or Pemetrexed adenocarcinoma）and 2nd line target therapy erlotinib . We target modulate effect Qingshu-Yiqi-Tang expression function myeloid-derived suppressor cell , Th1 , Th2 , cytotoxic T cell , NK cell , subtypes monocyte ( M1-like v M2-like ) . Flow cytometry use study cell subtypes . The related cytokine growth factor serum supernatant culture , include IL4 , IL-6 , IL13 , VEGF , TGFb , GM-CSF , analyze use ELISA FACS microbeads array . The expression iNOS arginase I verify use WB , IP RT-PCR . The molecular mechanism relate cell function study use ex vivo cell co-culture model . All patient follow three year maximum . We hope , via three-year proposal , explore possible mechanism Astragalus-based formula : Qingshu-Yiqi-Tang ( 清暑益氣湯 ) modulate reverse immunosuppression advance stage , non-small cell lung cancer patient . Through study , would find basis comprehensive research mechanism Chinese herbal medicine benefit lung cancer therapy .</detailed_description>
