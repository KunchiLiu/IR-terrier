	<detailed_description>Persona CE mark , natural method contraception work monitor hormone change woman 's urine identify day menstrual cycle likely become pregnant follow unprotected intercourse . Persona consist test stick measure luteinising hormone ( LH ) estrone-3-glucuronide ( E3G ) , read handheld monitor . This hormonal data convert use proprietary algorithm , simple-to-understand information user 's contraceptive status ; `` red light '' need abstain intercourse avoid pregnancy , `` green light '' unprotected intercourse unlikely lead pregnancy . A prospective 13 cycle reliability study find Persona 94 % effective . This study examine relationship information provide Persona assay ultrasound observe ovulation , along indicator woman fertile ( basal body temperature ( BBT ) measurement cervical secretion observation ) . This single centre clinical study conduct green-ivf clinic Grevenbroich , Germany . The primary objective ass difference time LH surge detect Persona observe ovulation reference transvaginal ultrasound examination . In addition , comparison Persona determine level LH E3G make urine serum level reproductive hormone . Comparison also make BBT cervical secretion observation indirect measurement fertile phase . In order achieve objective , minimum 40 female volunteer recruit study site either patient pool come routine gynaecological examination general population via newspaper advertisement . The study last one menstrual cycle start first day menstrual bleeding ( day 1 cycle ) conclude onset next menses . Volunteers ask collect daily urine sample use adapt Persona monitor duration study per first cycle use ( i.e . maximum 16 test ) . The monitor adapt blind user result test . Volunteers therefore advise modify Persona monitor use contraceptive device study . Volunteers also ask take daily measurement BBT record along cervical secretion observation daily natural family planning ( NFP ) chart . Volunteers require attend recruitment visit trial site follow approximately 12 visit either daily , two day apart . Transvaginal ultrasonography carry cycle day 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 daily 16mm follicular size onwards ovulation occur . Blood sample also conduct day well day 7 day 9 post-ovulation . Ultrasound examination , blood sample hormonal blood test perform trial centre . Urine sample ship study sponsor hormonal analysis . Diary scan data also transfer study sponsor provide single data set analysis .</detailed_description>
