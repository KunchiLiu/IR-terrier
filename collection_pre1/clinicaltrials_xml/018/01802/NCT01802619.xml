	<detailed_description>Prolonged period cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) cause high level plasma free haemoglobin ( Hb ) associate increased morbidity . We hypothesize repletion nitric oxide ( NO ) surgical procedure CPB may protect endothelium dysfunction organ failure cause plasma-Hb induced NO scavenging . There three possible beneficial mechanism deliver NO : 1 . Nitric oxide reduces ischemia-reperfusion injury ( acute myocardial infarction , stroke , acute tubular necrosis ) . 2 . Nitric oxide anti-inflammatory property . As antioxidant , exogenous NO may reduce injury counteract cytotoxic effect reactive oxygen specie , modulate leukocyte recruitment , edema formation tissue disruption . 3 . Exogenous nitric oxide prevents noxious effect hemolysis-associated NO dysregulation . During hemolysis , nitric oxide gas oxidize plasma oxyhemoglobin methemoglobin , thereby inhibit endogenous endothelium NO scavenge cell-free Hb . NO depletion hemolysis sequela . The release plasma free Hb ( Fe2+ iron ) hemolysis avidly scavenge nitric oxide ( NO ) dioxygenation reaction . Elevated plasma ferrous Hb level induce `` NO deficiency '' state . Reduced vascular nitric oxide level contribute vasoconstriction , inflammation , thrombosis , potentially contribute systemic endothelial dysfunction cardiac surgery CPB .</detailed_description>
