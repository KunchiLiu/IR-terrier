	<brief_summary>Syncope ( temporary loss consciousness ) frequent reason emergency department ( ED ) visit among old adult . The current ED evaluation syncope frequently lead hospitalization , result low diagnostic yield , enormously costly . The purpose protocol improve risk prediction syncope . Improved risk prediction inform design intervention safely reduce unnecessary health service use . This multi-center , prospective , observational cohort study old ( age≥60 year ) adults present emergency department syncope ( otherwise know fainting ) . The primary outcome composite 30-day cardiac death serious cardiac event . Study Aims Hypotheses : Specific Aim 1 . Describe serious outcome unexplained syncope ; rate reason admission ; frequency , diagnostic yield , therapeutic impact inpatient diagnostic test . H1 : Current pattern care represent diversity practice setting patient population costly low clinical benefit . Specific Aim 2 . Derive validate novel risk prediction model 30-day cardiac death serious cardiac outcome unexplained syncope . H2 : Explicit criterion include contemporary cardiac biomarkers improve risk stratification compare unstructured physician assessment publish risk model . Specific Aim 3 . Assess safety cost risk-tailored diagnostic algorithm compare exist care unexplained syncope . H3 : A risk-tailored diagnostic algorithm safely reduce cost evaluate unexplained syncope old adult .</brief_summary>
