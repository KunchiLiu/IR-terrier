	<brief_title>International Study Treatment Standard Risk Childhood Relapsed ALL 2010</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ALL frequent malignancy childhood favourable event-free overall survival rate . About 15 % patient suffer relapse . At relapse prognosis much inferior ( 50 % survival ) leukemic clone exhibit much resistance conventional chemotherapy . Patients relapse require treatment intensification different therapeutic strategy . At relapse , new target agent provide chance well cure rate need investigate prospective control trial may even eligible frontline treatment strategy . The IntReALL SR 2010 trial design achieve 2 major aim : Establishment best available standard chemotherapy treatment . This addressed randomization 2 best developed strategy treatment childhood relapse ALL , German ALL-REZ BFM 2002 Protocol Protocol II IDA arm , British ALL-R3 protocol mitoxantrone arm . This randomization allow confirm feasibility protocol large variety different country study group different frontline therapy strategy . As result trial common standard chemotherapy childhood relapse ALL develop serve backbone investigation attractive target new agent . The 2nd aim investigation efficacy tolerability humanize CD22 direct monoclonal antibody Epratuzumab , manufacture provide company Immunomedics , US . The drug randomly add respective consolidation chemotherapy , use EFS primary endpoint . Epratuzumab develop adult rheumatology indication B-cell malignancy . A phase I early phase II combination trial childhood relapse ALL conduct publish Children 's Oncology Group ( COG ) , result extend phase II trial recently present ASH meeting ( 12/2011 ) . The drug show favourable safety profile single drug combination multidrug chemotherapy . Activity moderate , recent trial show significantly good elimination minimal residual disease ( MRD ) patient achieve 2nd complete remission . This finding support strategy use Epratuzumab combination consolidation chemotherapy induction patient reduce leukemia burden bone marrow least 25 % , 2nd complete remission . Epratuzumab give weekly establish dose . Pharmacokinetics investigate reduced number patient . The treatment conventional intensive chemotherapy maintenance therapy patient good MRD response induction , allogeneic stem-cell transplantation ( SCT ) insufficient MRD response . SCT consider standard treatment element lead censor patient consider endpoint . Epratuzumab license far trial may add approval process case . Scientific advice trial request FDA EMA . Both institution respond supportively . Concerns recommendation FDA EMA address protocol correspond statistical analysis plan . The IntReALL SR 2010 trial finance within FP7 project IntReALL 2010 support European Commission . Within project next SR trial strategy HR patient address , establishment harmonize diagnostic procedure , international tumour bank comprehensive biologic/scientific programme set , web-based GCP conform database establish , comprehensive statistical strategy trial establish , drug development indication promote organized side disease expert cooperation establish academic structure ITCC ( Innovative Therapies Children Cancer ) , ENCCA project ( European Network Cancer Children Adolescents ) SIOPe ( International Society Pediatric Oncology Europe ) , central authority ( EMA , FDA ) Industry . Parent organisation former patient integrate accompany process . Main aim IntReALL FP7 project establish therapeutic platform child relapse ALL Europe beyond give access promise new agent academic control free commercial interest . Randomized evidence efficacy tolerability new drug demand competent authority . These trial conduct beyond mostly palliative patient group eligible phase I/II trial curative indication . Treatment protocols curative indication need conduct best interest patient , ideally academic sponsor . The design driven medical scientific evidence commercial interest case industry sponsor trial . This concept acknowledge European Commission select project fund many powerful application .</detailed_description>
