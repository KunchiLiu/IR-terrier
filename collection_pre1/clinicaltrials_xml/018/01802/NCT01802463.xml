	<brief_summary>Ocular blood flow consistently demonstrate altered glaucoma patient compare otherwise healthy individual . Numerous Doppler study show decrease flow velocity retrobulbar artery appear related degree glaucomatous disease . The anatomic pathway several artery eye intricately complicate , least one ( central retina artery ) penetrate optic nerve enter eye supply innermost structure globe . As optic nerve surround layer cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) continuity rest central nervous system , central retinal artery also cross CSF contain compartment . Because intrinsic pressure CSF - correspond intracranial pressure orbital level - possibility exist pressure around optic disc could affect blood flow artery go . The investigator try detect correlation exist optic nerve sheath diameter blood flow retrobulbar vessel glaucoma patient .</brief_summary>
