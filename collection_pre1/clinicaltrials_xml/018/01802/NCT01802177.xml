	<detailed_description>Alopecia Areata ( AA ) chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease cause nonscarring hair loss . Many treatment modality find helpful AA , however , none cure disease . Excimer laser show effective treatment AA control study . The main disadvantage previous study evaluate excimer laser choose separate patch control account interlesional treatment response variability . UVB excimer light recently emerge new therapeutic modality many dermatologic disease . However , study evaluate efficacy safety UVB excimer light AA . Those study show UVB excimer light effective treatment AA none conduct controlled fashion . There prospective randomized control trial evaluate efficacy safety UVB excimer light AA . We plan conduct prospective split lesion single-blinded randomized clinical trial ass efficacy safety UVB excimer light treatment AA . Study Objectives 1 . To evaluate potential UVB excimer light induce hair regrowth within AA patch . 2 . To assess side effect profile UVB excimer light use treatment AA .</detailed_description>
