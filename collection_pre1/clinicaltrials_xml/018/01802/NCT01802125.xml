	<detailed_description>Study Subtype : Ancillary/Correlative Observational Study Model : Cohort Time Perspective : Prospective Biospecimen Retention : Samples With DNA Biospecimen Description : Tissue Study Population Description : Patients ARST0332 study Sampling Method : Non-Probability Sample PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine proportion unclassifiable sarcoma unclassifiable initial evaluation sufficiently comprehensive versus proportion regard `` true '' undifferentiated sarcoma comprehensive assessment perform . II . To develop formal diagnostic criterion establish diagnosis undifferentiated sarcoma . III . To determine whether undifferentiated sarcoma subdivide separate distinct pathologic entity distinguishable light microscopy , immunohistochemistry , single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) array profiling , clinical feature . IV . To determine whether undifferentiated sarcoma specific `` actionable mutation '' identify base histologic appearance , immunohistochemical staining characteristic , SNP array profiling feature . OUTLINE : Tissue sample analyze loss heterozygosity ( LOH ) SNP array profile use microarray immunohistochemistry .</detailed_description>
