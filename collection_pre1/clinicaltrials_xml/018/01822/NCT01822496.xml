	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well erlotinib hydrochloride crizotinib chemoradiation therapy work treat patient stage III non-small cell lung cancer . Radiation therapy use high energy x ray kill tumor cell . Specialized radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , etoposide , paclitaxel , carboplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . It yet know whether give erlotinib hydrochloride effective crizotinib chemoradiation therapy treat patient non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Erlotinib Hydrochloride Crizotinib Chemoradiation Therapy Treating Patients With Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess whether patient unresectable local-regionally advanced non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) treat targeted agent base molecular characteristic longer progression-free survival treat standard care therapy alone . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response rate . II . To assess toxicity . III . To assess overall survival . IV . To correlate clinical outcome tumor molecular aberration identify deep sequencing select kinomes patient adequate baseline tissue available . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 4 treatment arm . ARM I ( induction therapy ) : Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 12 week . Patients response ( partial complete ) 6 week undergo concurrent chemoradiation therapy immediately . After 2 week completion induction therapy , patient receive chemoradiation . ARM III ( induction therapy ) : Patients receive crizotinib PO twice daily ( BID ) 12 week . Patients response ( partial complete ) 6 week undergo concurrent chemoradiation therapy immediately . After 2 week completion induction therapy , patient receive chemoradiation . ARMS II AND IV ( concurrent chemoradiation ) : Patients receive concurrent chemotherapy thoracic radiation therapy begin day 1 . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . CHEMORADIATION : In treatment arm , patient undergo concurrent intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy ( 3-D CRT ) QD 5 day week 6 week . Patients receive 1 2 chemotherapy regimen base discretion treat physician . Patients receive cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) 1-2 hour day 1 , 8 , 29 , 36 etoposide IV 1 hour day 1-5 29-33 . Treatment repeat every 4 week 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Some patient receive paclitaxel IV carboplatin IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 radiation therapy 6 week . Two course consolidation treatment begin 4-6 week completion radiation therapy paclitaxel IV day 1 22 carboplatin IV day 1 22 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 2 month , 4-6 week , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually 5 year .</detailed_description>
