	<brief_summary>Subjects relapse refractory neuroblastoma invite take part gene transfer research study . We find previous research put new gene call chimeric antigen receptor ( CAR ) T cell make recognize neuroblastoma cell kill . In previous clinical trial , use CAR recognize GD2 , protein find almost neuroblastoma cell ( GD2-CAR ) . We put gene T cell give back patient neuroblastoma . The infusion safe patient disease time infusion , time progression longer could find GD2 T cell blood 6 week . Because , think T cell able last long , may better chance kill neuroblastoma tumor cell . Therefore , study add new gene GD2 T cell cause cell live longer . These new gene call CD28 OX40 . The purpose study determine high dose iC9-GD2-CD28-OX40 ( iC9-GD2 ) T cell safely give patient relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma . In clinical study use T cell , investigator find give chemotherapy T cell infusion improve amount time T cell stay body therefore effect T cell . This call lymphodepletion think allow T cell infuse expand stay longer body , potentially kill cancer cell effectively . The chemotherapy use lymphodepletion combination cyclophosphamide fludarabine . Additionally , effectively kill tumor cell , important T cell able survive expand tumor . Recent study show solid tumor release substance ( PD1 ) inhibit T cell arrive tumor tissue . In attempt overcome effect PD1 neuroblastoma also give medication call pembrolizumab .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We make iC9-GD2 T cell infect normal T cell retroviral vector contain iC9-GD2 gene . After new gene put T cell , cell test make sure kill GD2-positive neuroblastoma cell either give fresh frozen patient ready infusion . First , patient receive cyclophosphamide fludarabine intravenously ( needle insert vein port-a-cath ) 2 day fludarabine alone one day ( Day -4 , -3 , -2 ) . On next day ( Day -1 ) patient receive drug call pembrolizumab intravenously . Finally Day 0 patient give infusion iC9 GD2 T cell vein IV line assign dose . The iC9-GD2 T cell infusion give Center Cell Gene Therapy Texas Children 's Hospital Houston Methodist Hospital . The infusion take 5 10 minute . Patients may need stay Houston 4 week infusion monitor side effect . On Day 21 ( time week 3 visit ) , treatment well tolerate , patient receive another dose pembrolizumab intravenously . There follow-up visit every 1-2 week first 2 month space total 15 year . Because cell modify new gene must follow patient least 15 year see long term side effect gene transfer . During visit , see patient certain time point obtain extra blood sample learn way iC9-GD2 T cell work long last body . After disease re-evaluation , disease gotten bad , future seem patient might benefit severe side effect cause infusion iC9-GD2 T cell , patient may eligible receive 2 additional dos T cell . Each dose dose level first infusion separate least 6 week make sure patient severe side effect infusion . If patient receive additional dos iC9-GD2 T-cells , may need stay Houston 4 week infusion well monitor side effect . If severe side effect pembrolizumab , patient receive pembrolizumab iC9 GD2 T cell day T cell injection 21 day T cell .</detailed_description>

However , patient cardiomegaly image may enrol assessment cardiac function ( i.e. , ECHO MUGA ) within 3 week start protocol therapy within normal limit . Additionally , patient bilateral pulmonary infiltrates image may enrol lesion consistent active neuroblastoma ( i.e. , negative functional imaging PET MIBG , pathologic assessment ) .
