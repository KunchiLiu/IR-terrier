	<brief_summary>The objective trial global risk-benefit assessment Cerebrolysin compare donepezil patient mild moderate dementia Alzheimer 's Type ( DAT ) . In addition , traditional approach take base evaluation separate risk benefit domain comparison donepezil . Global risk-benefit compare donepezil analyze determine whether Cerebrolysin group show statistically significant non-inferiority regard combine primary safety efficacy endpoint ( weighted multivariate ensemble ) . The endpoint combine global multivariate non-parametric procedure , weight safety efficacy part 50:50 .</brief_summary>
