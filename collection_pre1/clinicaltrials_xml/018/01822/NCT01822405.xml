	<detailed_description>Patients head neck tumor often present superficial radiation induce fibrosis late complication radiotherapy seriously affect quality life . The pentoxifylline use tocopherol achieve certain effectiveness treatment fibrosis . Hyperbaric oxygen therapy recommend used wide variety medical condition include treatment delay radiation injury ( soft tissue bony radiation necrosis ) . The hyperbaric oxygen therapy increase formation granulation tissue produce angiogenesis maintain use . Both treatment combination could produce synergistic effect angiogenesis induce hyperbaric oxygen therapy allow good access drug injury . The magnetic resonance , provide data fibrosis side effect radiotherapy .</detailed_description>
