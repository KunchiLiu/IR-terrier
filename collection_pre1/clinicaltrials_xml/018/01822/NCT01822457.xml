	<brief_summary>This randomise control study patient suffer intermittent claudication ( IC ) , assess impact wear Nike FuelBand ( NFB ) walk distance , exercise level quality life . IC manifest pain calf , thigh buttock muscle walk . It cause narrowing blockage blood vessel legs . The NFB discrete wristband built-in accelerometer measure motion . It provide estimate number step take amount distance cover day . This study conduct period 18 month Imperial College Trust 's vascular outpatient service . Patients meet inclusion/exclusion criterion ask consider participate . Participants receive routine diagnostic work addition walk distance measure lab treadmill . They also functional status mood assess use questionnaire . These assessment carry total five time course study . Patients need make additional visit hospital . Patients randomly allocate either NFB group control group . Patients NFB group give FuelBand instruction use . All patient give routine instruction maintain activity target daily walking distance . Target walk distance program NFB . Patients NFB group ask record estimate far walk day directly band . All patient contact telephone pre-arranged time collect recording . Patients follow routine 3-month follow appointment additionally 6 12 month .</brief_summary>
