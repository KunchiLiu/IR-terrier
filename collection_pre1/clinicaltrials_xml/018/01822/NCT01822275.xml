	<brief_summary>In current propose trial role low-dose WBRT ( 0.15 Gy ) would safely treat microscopic distant GBM cell outside high dose RT region sensitize gross tumor , focal radiation dose ( 1.85 Gy ) gross tumor bring total tumor dose 2 Gy per fraction standard care . Radiotherapy ( RT ) integral treatment GBM since 1970s Walker et al . show post-operative whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) offer significant improvement median survival time , even give concomitant BCNU chemotherapy . Ensuing dose escalation study find optimal dose 60 Gy . Patients could tolerate escalation high dose 60 Gy WBRT due unacceptable toxicity . Even WBRT 60 Gy , huge volume healthy brain tissue unnecessarily treat high-dose radiation ; recurrence WBRT remain overwhelmingly local . Hochberg Pruitt ( 1980 ) find WBRT 3 % recurrence outside 2 cm margin primary tumor . With rise CT scan 1980s MRI 1990s , along subsequent improvement three-dimensional conformal radiation , partial brain RT ( PBRT ) become practical since tumor margin could visualize irradiated accurately . - Subsequently , WBRT show provide survival benefit PBRT dosage ; - thus , latter take standard care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Low-Dose Whole Brain Radiotherapy With Concurrent Temozolomide Adjuvant Temozolomide Patients With Newly-Diagnosed Glioblastoma Multiforme</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiation Therapy ( RT ) integral treatment GBM since 1970s . Studies show post-operative whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) offer significant improvement median survival time , even give chemotherapy . Even WBRT , huge volume healthy brain tissue unnecessarily treat high-dose radiation ; re-growth tumor WBRT remain overwhelmingly close original tumor site . With advance image technique , like CT scan MRIs , partial brain RT ( PBRT ) become common practice . PBRT RT give tumor area brain cancer remove . PBRT give drug call temozolomide ( TMZ ) use standard care treatment newly diagnose GBM surgery . Current data institution suggest combination TMZ low-dose WBRT efficiently kill GBM cell . WBRT conventional high dos give time TMZ since severe toxicity risk would risky . However , low daily WBRT dose , conventionally give patient , tolerable . The randomized trial study TMZ low-dose WBRT patient brain metastasis demonstrate increase serious toxicity associate TMZ . PURPOSE OF STUDY Why research study do ? The purpose study determine low-dose WBRT give combination standard care TMZ regimen safe effective . The role low-dose WBRT would safely treat microscopic distant GBM cell outside high-dose PBRT region . We continue target tumor focused PBRT bring total tumor dose standard care dose . This study find effect , good bad , low-dose WBRT cancer . PROCEDURES How many people take part study ? About 47 people take part study . Patient participation study voluntary . The research conduct UMMS . What happen I take part research study ? Before begin study… Patient need follow exam , test procedure find study . These exam , test procedure part regular cancer care may do even Patient join study . If he/she recently , may need repeat . This study doctor . - History physical neurological examination - Brain MRI contrast - Blood test ( 2-3 teaspoon blood take vein ) - Pregnancy test woman childbearing potential During study… The experimental part study patient receive low-dose WBRT . If test show patient study , he/she chooses take part , patient receive low-dose WBRT time standard PBRT . The patient receive RT daily , 5 day week ( Monday Friday ) 6 week ( total 30 treatment ) . Each treatment last 30 minute . Treatment begin 3-6 week last surgery . At time RT take oral TMZ day . TMZ take continuously night first day RT last day RT ( maximum 49 day ) . The pill swallow whole take empty stomach , therefore minimum 2 hour eat food consumption least 1 hour TMZ administration . The drug take night . About 4 week finish RT TMZ , begin 28 day cycle TMZ alone . You take TMZ orally first 5 day cycle . Again , pills swallow whole take empty stomach , therefore minimum 2 hour eat food consumption least 1 hour TMZ administration . You take TMZ night . If patient miss dose TMZ , make next day . The patient treat post-radiation TMZ 6 cycle unless evidence tumor progression treatment-related toxicity . Patients demonstrate continued benefit adjuvant treatment continue treatment maximum 12 cycle discretion treat physician . If exams , test procedures show patient study , choose take part , he/she need follow test procedure . They part regular cancer care . Weekly RT TMZ : - Patient evaluation toxicity assessment - Blood test ( 2-3 teaspoon blood take vein ) Prior start cycle TMZ alone : - History physical neurological examination toxicity assessment - Blood test ( 2-3 teaspoon blood take vein ) - Prior cycle 1 every 2-3 month , brain MRI contrast Blood test ( 2-3 teaspoon blood take vein ) also perform 2 3 week ( day 14 21 ( ± 2days ) ) start cycle 1 cycle 2 TMZ alone During follow-up… Once patient complete cycle TMZ patient see every 1-3 month first two year ( year 1-2 ) , 3-6 month next 2 year ( year 3-4 ) , annually start year 5 . During follow-up visit patient follow test procedure perform : - History physical neurological examination toxicity assessment - Brain MRI contrast - Any test deem medically necessary The doctor would like keep track medical condition rest patient 's life . Keeping touch patient check condition yearly help physician look long-term effect study .</detailed_description>
