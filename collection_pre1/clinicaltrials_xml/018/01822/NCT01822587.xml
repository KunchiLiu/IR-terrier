	<brief_summary>The investigator ' recently complete study provide first evidence administration medication propranolol , follow exposure cocaine cue , alter drug-associated memory reduce crave drug cue-elicited response cocaine addict person . The investigator attempt augment effect ) double number propranolol-medicated cocaine cue exposure ( CCE ) retrieval session b ) increase dose propranolol . It expect propranolol treat group , relative placebo treat group , evidence great reduction craving , cue reactivity cocaine use follow-up cocaine cue exposure . Also , effect great receive 80mg propranolol oppose 40mg .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Three group CD ( cocaine dependant ) participant receive two session cocaine cue exposure ( CCE ) , separate 24 hr . period conduct participant remain hospital . One group ( PBO ) receive placebo follow CCE session second ( 40PP ) third ( 80PP ) group receive 40 mg 80 mg propranolol , respectively . Participants return two day , 1 , 3 , 6 week discharge administer CCE session ass maintenance/generalization disruption reconsolidation ( DoR ) effect crave cue reactivity familiar novel cocaine cue . Participants also assess 3 time weekly cocaine use ( self-report &amp; urine drug screen ) follow-up .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must meet DSMIV criterion current cocaine dependence ( within past month ) . Participants may meet criterion abuse , dependence , substance exception nicotine . Because high comorbidity cocaine nicotine dependence , exclude nicotine dependence would seriously compromise feasibility recruitment ( nicotine patch provide participant course involvement laboratory procedure ) . Although individual meet criterion alcohol abuse accept study participation , anyone measurable blood alcohol level day test exclude acute alcohol intake low seizure threshold . Participants must able provide inform consent function intellectual level sufficient allow accurate completion assessment instruments.Exclusion Criteria : Use one follow method birth control female participant : barrier method ( diaphragm condom spermicidal ) , surgical sterilization , use intrauterine contraceptive device , complete abstinence sexual intercourse . Individuals must live within 50mile radius research program reliable transportation . Individuals must consent remain abstinent drug abuse ( except nicotine ) 72 hour immediately prior CTRC inpatient admission . Individuals must consent random assignment one three study group ( two propranololtreated group placebotreated group ) . Women pregnant , nurse childbearing potential practicing effective mean birth control . Individuals evidence history significant hematological , endocrine , cardiovascular , pulmonary , renal , gastrointestinal , neurological disease include diabetes , condition may affect heart rate skin conductance measurement . Individuals significant liver impairment propranolol hepatically metabolize . Individuals history current psychotic disorder , current major depressive disorder , bipolar affective disorder severe anxiety disorder may impact cue reactivity . Individuals currently take antiarrythmic agent , psychostimulants agent know interfere heart rate skin conductance monitoring . Known suspected hypersensitivity propranolol . Individuals take medication could adversely interact study medication , include , limited albuterol , insulin , significant inhibitor CYP2D6 . Individuals bronchial asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , use propranolol contraindicate individual . Individuals physical condition disability would compromise optimal sensory processing cue ( e.g. , blindness ) .</criteria>
