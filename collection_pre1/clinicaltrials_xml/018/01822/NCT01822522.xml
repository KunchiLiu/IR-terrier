	<brief_title>Cabozantinib-S-Malate Treating Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors Human Immunodeficiency Virus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability cabozantinib ( XL184 ) ( cabozantinib-s-malate ) single agent solid tumor participant human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection determine maximal tolerate dose ( MTD ) patient population . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate possible pharmacokinetic interaction cabozantinib antiretroviral therapy person HIV infection . II . To investigate effect therapy participant immune status HIV viral load . III . To preliminarily assess objective response rate associate treatment commonly represent tumor . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
