	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Effectiveness Laser-Ablated Implant-Abutments Promote Tissue Healing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study assess integrity peri-implant oral soft-tissue attachment implant abutment compare tissue response laser-ablated implant-abutment implant-abutment manufacture smooth surface . Investigators assess initial post-surgical peri-implant attachment-seal test whether tissue-abutment interface re-forms equal integrity abutment remove replace new abutment . Data include histological , radiographic , clinical , subjective aesthetic compare effectiveness two abutment design . Both device supply BioHorizons Implant Systems Inc. Birmingham , Alabama ; abutment analogous design material except test device laser-ablated surface control abutment smooth .</detailed_description>
