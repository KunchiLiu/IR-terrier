	<brief_summary>Fat graft represent technique great potential improve outcome minimally invasive facial reconstruction . Fat graft already demonstrate safe minimally invasive technique decade widespread practice plastic surgery . In current study fat graft facial deformity ( IRB # PRO09060101 ) , treat 9 subject without adverse event significant improvement . Since method treatment evaluation study , able use data prior study additional control data . We hypothesize repeat fat graft subject previous facial fat graft enable successful restoration tissue volume craniofacial form . Additionally , hypothesize result durable subject quality life improve . Five ( 5 ) subject ( previously enrol IRB # PRO09060101 ) enrol single center University Pittsburgh site research study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Structural Fat Grafting Craniofacial Trauma : Repeat Fat Grafting Injection-5 Subject Cohort</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Facial trauma injury , especially sustained military combat severe automobile crash , characterize destruction bone soft tissue anatomy . While bony skeleton often reconstruct , overlie soft tissue difficult restore . Importantly , structure soft tissue imparts normal human form , adequate reconstruction soft tissue defect allow trauma victim reintegrate society . Accepted procedure soft tissue reconstruction face involve tissue flap reconstruction procedures autologous fat grafting . Tissue flap operation extensive , often include microvascular surgery , precisely correct deformity . Fat graft less invasive technique allow precise shape reconstructed tissue . However , autologous fat graft may undergo resorption affect appearance reconstruction time . The degree change appearance fat graft well study facial trauma patient . We hypothesize subject successfully complete participation study ( PRO09060101 ) experience graft resorbtion improve outcomes additional fat graft treatment . We anticipate additional fat graft treatment fully restore facial feature overcome fat loss initial fat graft treatment . Additionally , hypothesize cellular property fat precursor cell ( preadipocytes ) may correlate fat graft retention</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Aged 18 year older able provide inform consent 2 . Have suffer injury result craniofacial volume defect could treat graft volume 5 150 cc lipoaspirate 3 . Be least 3 month postinjury postsurgery ( trauma procedure ) acute edema resolve 4 . Volume defect cover intact skin communicate oral cavity sinuses 5 . The three dimensional geometry volume defect would allow treatment lipoaspirate injection manner least two distinct treat area could discern gross examination radiographically ( e.g . treated region opposite side face , low face versus upper face , separate bony landmark zygoma . This would include ability treat uninjured contralateral region lipaspirate order obtain symmetry . 6 . Willing able comply follow examination , include radiographic study 7 . Have complete participation IRB # PRO09060101 . 1 . Age le 18 year 2 . Inability provide inform consent 3 .
