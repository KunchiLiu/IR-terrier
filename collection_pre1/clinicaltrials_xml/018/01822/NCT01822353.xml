	<brief_summary>In Finland , estimate prevalence physician-diagnosed food allergy 1-4 year old child 9 % , common allergen milk . The overall food allergy report 3.7 % . Hen 's egg allergy among common food allergy childhood . In addition , predict later development allergic disease asthma . Most egg milk allergy transient disappears childhood . Currently , standard care food allergy include strict allergen avoidance . However , oral immunotherapy investigation child milk , egg , wheat allergy . Previously , induction clinical egg tolerance report egg oral immunotherapy child age 3 13 year . In adult , strict avoidance still standard care also grow interest treatment severe food allergy oral immunotherapy anti-IgE . The investigator aim analyse result per oral immunotherapy treatment severe IgE-mediated egg , milk , nut allergy adult . Could severe egg , milk nut allergy treat oral immunotherapy treatment stead total allergen avoidance could desensitization thus achieve ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Per Oral Immunotherapy Severe IgE Mediated Egg , Milk , Nut Allergy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Up 100 subject study . All subject adult severe chronic disease . The subject belong four different group : 1 . 30 18-50 year old start per oral immunotherapy treatment severe egg allergy . 2 . 30 18-50 year old start per oral immunotherapy treatment severe milk allergy . 3 . 30 18-50 year old start per oral immunotherapy treatment severe nut allergy . 4 . 10 milk allergic 18-50 year old treat pilot patient milk hyposensitisation treatment . The diagnosis milk egg allergy verify positive history , skin prick test , egg , milk nut allergen specific IgE antibody . In addition , food allergy verify allergen specific challenge test . Atopic subject may simultaneously allergy . Intermittent mild asthma , mild moderate persistent asthma tolerate treatment inhaled steroid asthma medication allow . Atopic subject may additional skin symptom . Quality life , anxiety patient history data collect questionnaire . All patient undergo spirometry bronchodilatation test , fractional exhale nitric oxide methacholine challenge year oral immunotherapy . Those test result diagnostic asthma treat asthma medication hyposensitisation treatment start . Exclusion criterion : adult instable cerebrovascular heart disease , active autoimmune disease cancer , use betablocker agent . In addition , poorly control asthma FEV1 &lt; 70 % tolerate . In oral immunotherapy , increase dos give first observe , daily home . If subject tolerate give dose symptom mild , dose previously tolerate one repeat , protocol proceeds outline . If subject experience significant symptom , protocol stop , high tolerate dose use start daily one .</detailed_description>
