	<brief_summary>The study hypothesis patient dry age-related macular degeneration experience visual function impairment defect dark adaptation , glare intolerance , poor light transition read low lighting condition . Studies show patient early phase AMD normal visual acuity commonly report difficulty visual function systematic study evaluate deficit population . This prospective , exploratory study include 130 patient dry AMD 60 control . These patient undergo follow non-invasive visual function testing : - microperimetry eye track - low luminance visual acuity - specialized color vision ( cone-specific ) - contrast test night vision test . High-resolution spectral domain optical coherence tomography ( SDOCT ) image take central retina use Spectralis OCT unit . The value visual function test correlated finding SDOCT ( volume/amount drusen present early AMD ) . There known risk subject beyond normal standard examination eye , visual function test standard ocular photographic procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , exploratory study perform multiple arm : A . Arm 1 : pilot study 40 patient ( 30 patient dry age-related macular degeneration 10 normal age-matched control ) order test 1 ) feasibility perform visual function test population 2 ) test/retest reliability 1-2 month . If pilot study reveals visual function test propose feasible high reliability , large study ( Phase 2 ) subsequently perform . B . Arm 2 : study 160 patient ( 130 dry AMD patient 32 control ) goal evaluate change visual function dry AMD compare age-matched control subject . Study include patient determined examination dry AMD well age-matched normal control subject without dry AMD . If two eye satisfy inclusion criterion , eye test . After consent obtain follow full explanation research , subject undergo follow non-invasive visual function testing : dark adaptation microperimetry eye tracking , specialized color vision ( cone specific ) , contrast test night vision test . During standard retina examination , color fundus photo take use Zeiss camera . Fundus Autoflorescence ( FA ) , macular pigment optical density ( MPOD ) base blue- green dual wave lenght FAF high resolution spectral domain OCT ( SDOCT ) image take central retina use Heidelberg Spectralis OCT unit . The value visula function test correlated finding SDOCT ( volume/amount drusen present dry AMD ) . During test day , first patient first undergo microperimetry testing , incorporate eye tracker operate independently microperimeter able compare result reference database normal subject . A Line Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope ( SLO ) use capture confocal image retina . Using SLO image , operator see area test . For follow-up examination , area test machine generates report change previous examination . The test take approximately 5 minute . Patients undergo cone specific vision testing . The cone contrast test ( CCT ) computer-based color test rapidly identifies type ( red , green , blue ) severity ( mild , moderate , severe ) color deficiency , quantifies color performance , allow early detection acquire color deficiency . The automated test take approximately 5 minute complete three cone tone ; study show impairment blue green cone AMD . The system also provide test low contrast sensitivity night vision ( simulate low lighting condition , darker background ) . Using computerized visual acuity chart , patient also test day night glare luminance . Using dark adaptometer , dark adaptation time measure . Subjects also complete quality life questionnaire ( NEI VFQ ) low luminance questionnaire . The duration test vary typically last 10-30 minute . A tube blood 5 ml collect 160 willing participant anytime study enrollment . The collected blood sample use genetics study associate AMD . The sample store Duke Eye Center need sample obtain . All sample send Hoffman La Roche AG PDGE Functional Excellence , Biosample Repository Management Evaluation visual function impairment patient early dry age-related macular degeneration Basel , Switzerland genetic testing . Follow-up visual function test perform different time point depend Arm study : 1-2 month Arm 1 approximately 6 , 12 , 18 24 month Arm 2 use protocol , base standard care clinic visit .</detailed_description>
