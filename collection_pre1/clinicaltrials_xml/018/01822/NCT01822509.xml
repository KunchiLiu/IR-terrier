	<brief_title>Ipilimumab Nivolumab Treating Patients With Relapsed Hematologic Malignancies After Donor Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum-tolerated dose ( MTD ) ipilimumab nivolumab administered patient relapse hematologic malignancy follow allogeneic stem cell transplantation . ( Phase I ) II . To characterize toxicity ipilimumab nivolumab administer MTD patient population . ( Phase Ib ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess response rate . II . To assess progression free overall survival . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess phenotypic functional effect ipilimumab nivolumab immune cell . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . INDUCTION PHASE : Patients receive ipilimumab intravenously ( IV ) 90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive nivolumab IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE PHASE : Patients receive ipilimumab IV 90 minute . Treatment repeat every 12 week begin course 5 ( 24 week first dose ipilimumab ) 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve clinical benefit option continue ongoing maintenance dose every 12 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive nivolumab IV 30 minute every 2 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Treatment repeat every 14 day total 60 week ( include Induction ) absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 year .</detailed_description>
