This project include two sequential clinical trail examine variation CRA + Vouchers treatment cocaine dependence design explore match treatment parameter patient baseline characteristic know moderate treatment response among cocaine-dependent outpatient . In Trial 1 , patient randomly assign receive 24 week CRA therapy randomly assign one three voucher-based incentive condition : ( ) 6 week voucher contingent abstinence incentive monetary value usual level ; ( b ) 6 week voucher contingent abstinence incentive value set usual level low-severity patient ( intranasal cocaine user marry patient ) twice usual value high severity patient ( i.e. , unmarried cocaine smokers/injectors ) , ( c ) control condition incentive provide independent recent cocaine use . In Trial 2 , patient receive 12 week abstinence-contingent incentive , randomly assign also receive ( ) 24 week CRA therapy ( b ) 4 week CRA therapy . The overarch goal two trial strike balance aforementioned bias towards constrain cost maximize efficacy thereby facilitate cost containment without compromise efficacy , especially among severe patient .</detailed_description>
