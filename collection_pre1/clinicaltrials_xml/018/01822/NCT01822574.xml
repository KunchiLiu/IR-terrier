	<brief_summary>This research perform determine three technique use knee surgeon Mayo Clinic accurate surgical removal ( resection ) knee-cap ( patella ) symmetric fashion total knee replacement ( arthroplasty ) . Although three technique know effective , three technique never compare one another determine one effective others resect patella .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Three Surgical Techniques Achieve Patella Symmetry During Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Resection patella prepare placement patellar prosthesis procedure perform routinely vast majority total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) United States Mayo Clinic . This procedure perform number different technique prove safe effective . Despite , patellar instability , tilt , obliquity , maltracking possible complication improperly resect patellae TKA . The goal resection create patella symmetrical , absent obliquity ( slant ) , thick enough receive patellar prosthesis . Although outcomes generally good describe method , date , little publish regard direct comparison method . Patients undergo TKA plan patellar resection randomize patella resect one three method primary TKA : 1 ) use cut guide , 2 ) haptic feedback , 3 ) free-hand resection guide four quadrant measurement . There three experience fellowship-trained arthroplasty surgeon ( hip knee ) performing procedure familiar experience three technique investigate . Each surgeon , within group 30 patient , perform total 10 resection use three method list ( 30 resection per surgeon total 90 resection ) . Before resection measurement knee-cap thickness take used determine patellar symmetry . The result symmetry three technique compare within three technique surgeon . Each procedure also time first measurement staff surgeon final measurement surgeon .</detailed_description>
