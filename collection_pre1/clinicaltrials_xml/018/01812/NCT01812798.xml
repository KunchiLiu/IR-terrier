	<brief_summary>An important gap management peanut allergy know threshold dose , peanut allergic individual react . There likely spectrum reactivity peanut individual react trace dos , whereas others able tolerate large dos . The purpose study determine minimum threshold dose need cause mild objective reaction peanut consume peanut-allergic individual carefully control clinical setting . 30 peanut-allergic participant age 7-65 year undergo two-day , double blind placebo control food challenge . Participants gradually feed increase amount peanut , placebo , objective allergic symptom observe . Statistical model individual threshold dos use determine population threshold dose , level peanut 90 % peanut-allergic population react . Knowledge threshold dos individual population level valuable provide critical information management peanut allergy individual , caregiver health professional , well knowledge allergen risk public health agency food industry .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Canadian Peanut Thresholds Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overview This study protocol model consensus protocol develop input clinical allergist allergy stakeholder standardize threshold challenge study [ 5-8 ] . As per protocol , 30 patient know convincing history peanut allergy recruit . After initial screen visit verify eligibility , participant undergo two-day DBPCFC . Briefly , qualify participant feed increase amount peanut mask food matrix . On different day , participant fed amount food matrix without peanut . Overall , study require three visit participant : screening day determine prospective participant meet eligibility criterion , two day DBPCFC . Study Procedures Screening Visit Prospective participant come Allergy Clinic McMaster University Medical Centre screen visit 6 month prior DBPCFC order confirm study eligibility . The informed consent form review signed time . The allergic status prospective participant characterize patient history , skin prick test ( SPT ) , peanut-specific IgE , relate overall allergic population . Relevant history ( reaction relate peanut food , allergic co-morbidities , medical condition , medication , family history , etc . ) record . A physical examination perform include skin prick test peanut routine inhalant allergen panel . Blood work do baseline measure analyze described . Skin Prick Test ( SPT ) As positive SPT need qualify participant study , prospective participant SPT screen visit . SPTs judge record base size wheal ( raise welt around prick site ) flare ( reddened area around wheal ) compare positive negative control skin test 15-30 minute [ 9 ] . A SPT deem positive comparison negative control skin test . Skin test reaction wheal diameter 3 mm great negative saline control consider positive . The diameter wheal diameter wheal flare record . A record peanut SPT size keep via cellophane tape record . Blood draw During screen visit , blood sample take prospective participant order test vitro peanut-specific IgE level . The amount blood drawn dependent age weight subject ( see Appendix III ) . The blood separate serum submit specific test peanut protein . Testing IgE peanut require milliliter serum . The remain serum use identify specific protein peanut bind IgE subject 's serum characterization peanut protein . Serum sample cod protect identity subject , store McMaster University Medical Centre , use supply exhaust . Double Blind Placebo Controlled Food Challenge Participants come Allergy Clinic McMaster University Medical Centre DBPCFC , take 2 day . Each visit last minimum 4 hour minimum one week food challenge visit . Oral food challenge occur clinical setting allow prompt medical treatment necessary protocol . Participants monitor qualified medical personnel . An IV put place prior start challenge . In extremely unlikely event subject severe reaction challenge , code cart special emergency supply include intubation equipment defibrillator available epinephrine medication administer accord severity reaction . Each participant randomize receive either peanut Day 1 placebo Day 2 vice versa . The randomization process challenge material describe detail . On 'peanut ' day , participant orally challenge 17 dos peanut mask suitable food matrix , applesauce chocolate pudding . To ensure establishment NOAEL , start dose 0.1mg , 50-30 time low previously report . The progression dose follow define schedule 5000g . On separate day , participant challenge equivalent series placebo dos . To start challenge , participant give small amount either peanut ( masked challenge vehicle ) start 0.1 mg placebo . Doses give 20-30 minute interval participant monitor continuously dos . The dose peanut increase follow progression : 1 . One follow objective finding observe : 1 . Rash : erythema , morbilliform rash , urticarial , angioedema 2 . Ocular : conjunctival swelling , scleral edema , tear 3 . Nasal : congestion , rhinorrhea , sneeze 4 . Gastrointestinal : vomiting , diarrhea 5 . Systemic : blood pressure drop â‰¥ 20 % 2 . The final dose peanut reach 3 . Physician 's discretion All subjective objective symptom fully record data collection form . Vital sign ( oxygen saturation , blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate ) assess every dose , every new subjective symptom report , objective finding observe . The challenge may stop discretion principal investigator participant tolerate subjective symptom . Once objective reactive symptom observe , challenge immediately stop participant receive appropriate medication may include epinephrine , antihistamine , steroid manage reaction . Participants observe minimum 2 hour allergic reaction occur ensure adequately treat resolve .</detailed_description>
