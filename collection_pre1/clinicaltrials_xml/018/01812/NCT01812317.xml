	<brief_summary>Fire-fighters increase risk death heart attack compare emergency service professional whose job involve similar component emergency call-outs shift work . The unique risk fire-fighters likely reflect combination factor include extreme physical exertion , mental stress , heat pollutant exposure . In large analysis cause death amongst on-duty fire-fighters , fire-fighter death classify accord duty perform onset symptom immediately prior sudden death . The majority death due cardiovascular cause ( i.e . heart attack ) occur fire-suppression whilst activity represent relatively small amount fire-fighters professional time . Fire simulation training center offer unique opportunity assess heart , blood blood vessel response fire suppression control environment . In study investigator assess healthy career fire-fighters two occasion : follow fire-suppression training exercise purpose build real-fire training center , follow sedentary period control . The investigator take blood sample measure platelet activity ( platelet particles blood help blood clot ) examine blood clot outside body . The investigator perform study place small needle arm ass blood vessel function follow fire suppression . By undertake comprehensive assessment blood , blood vessel heart function hope understand mechanism whereby risk heart attack influence fire suppression . The investigator hypothesize follow fire-suppression exercise firefighter blood clot readily blood vessel relax properly two main process development heart attack .</brief_summary>
