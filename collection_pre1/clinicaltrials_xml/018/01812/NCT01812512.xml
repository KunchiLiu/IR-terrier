	<brief_summary>People heart failure ( HF ) hospitalize million time year US cost $ 39 billion dollar . About half patient readmitted within 30 day . Despite number institutional reform , cost readmission remain high VA . The VA Home Telehealth ( HT ) monitor program decrease preventable readmission , HF readmission remain increased VA . Despite active effective HT program , Charleston VAMC high HF readmission rate VISN 7 . Though HT program introduces communication , self-management , share decision-making initial training , previous QUERI RRP evaluation identify low expect level specific communication practice associate promotion HF self-management share decision-making , mediate requirement technology .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Clinical goal VA CHF QUERI identify best practice empower Veterans caregiver HF self-management . Recommendations American College Cardiology/American Heart Association emphasize share decision-making . In previous preliminary study , cod actual recording Veterans speak HT nurse care coordinator provide evidence best practice area improvement intervention development . The effect HT technology mediator Veteran-nurse communication require particular re-framing communication skill train promote share decision-making self-management recommend . This quasi-experimental study propose development evidence-based intervention enhance HT training tailor effective communication HF self-management related outcome . Goals : Phase 1 To conduct pilot study quasi-experimental trial two VAMC HT sit determine acceptability , actual use , implementation , practicality , integration , potential expansion , effect size limit efficacy HT-specific communication skill intervention HF Specific Aim 1.1a Development : Adapt component Rochester Participatory Decision-Making Scale ( RPAD ) recent advance communication skill train chronic disease develop valid reliable intervention specific HT share decision-making telehealth communication use establish best-practices Veteran input ; Specific Aim 1.1b Training/Implementation : Implement develop intervention two VAMCs ; Specific Aim 1.2Booster : Introduce audit feedback loop HF self-management outcome telehealth nurse practice booster reinforce communication skill train . Phase 2 To compare change Veteran outcomes telehealth communication skill intervention document previous practice difference : ) share decision-making ; b ) Veteran perception communication , education self-management HF , c ) quality life , ) health service utilization relate cost intervention Specific Aim 2.1 : Formative Evaluation : Nurses : Conduct anonymous survey knowledge HF self-management strategy training , qualitative interview reaction train course , nurse care coordinator focus group value audit feedback session training . Specific Aim 2.2 : Formative Evaluation : Veterans - Phone record 25 Veterans HF two HT site , total 50 Veterans , speak nurse care coordinator communication skill train follow communication cod discourse analysis . Specific Aim 2.3 : Summative Evaluation : Compare share decision-making score ( SDM ) measure RPAD , communication score measure Four Habits Coding Scheme ( FHCS ) , quality life ( Minnesota Living Heart Failure Questionnaire ) , communication , education self-management HF measure Improving Chronic Illness Care Evaluation ( ICICE ) scale , patient HF hospitalization use ( admission emergency ) pre-training average post training average 1 3 month Rationale The technology HT monitoring Veterans HF inadvertently decrease participative communication consistent share decision-making HF self-management . Application communication skill train use evidence-based coach role competency promise improve Veteran engagement participation VA Home Telehealth service increase self-management potential improvement HF health service utilization . Improving engagement participation self-management result quantifiably well Veteran quality life , reduction hospital ED admission , thus , decrease health care utilization cost VA .</detailed_description>
