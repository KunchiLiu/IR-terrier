	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well carfilzomib dexamethasone work treat patient multiple myeloma previously underwent stem cell transplant . Carfilzomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Immunosuppressive therapy , dexamethasone , may improve bone marrow function increase blood cell count . Giving carfilzomib together dexamethasone may effective treatment multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carfilzomib Dexamethasone Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma Who Previously Underwent Stem Cell Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess complete response ( CR ) rate carfilzomib dexamethasone consolidation follow upfront single stem cell transplant ( SCT ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess toxicity carfilzomib dexamethasone use consolidation therapy patient post SCT . II . To determine progression free rate 1 2 year post SCT . III . To evaluate progression-free survival overall survival . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine proportion patient achieve minimal residual disease ( MRD ) negative status . II . To assess HevyLite assay prior treatment . OUTLINE : Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute dexamethasone orally ( PO ) day 1 , 2 , 15 , 16 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study therapy , patient follow every 3 month 3 year every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
