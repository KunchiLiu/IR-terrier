	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well alisertib without rituximab work treat patient relapsed refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma . Alisertib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , block cancer growth different way . Some block ability cancer cell grow spread . Others find cancer cell help kill carry cancer-killing substance . Giving alisertib without rituximab may effective treatment B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Alisertib With Without Rituximab Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory B-Cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine efficacy MLN8237 ( alisertib ) alone patient relapse refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) transform NHL . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine efficacy MLN8237 combine rituximab NHL patient fail respond MLN8237 alone patient relapse refractory NHL transform NHL . II . To determine specific toxicity associate MLN8237 alone combine rituximab ( NHL patient ) patient relapse refractory NHL transform NHL . III . To determine pharmacokinetics MLN8237 alone combination rituximab ( NHL patient ) patient relapse refractory NHL transform NHL . IV . To evaluate specific molecular characteristic NHL patient treat MLN8237 alone rituximab order correlate particular molecular marker response survival . V. To evaluate long term survival patient treat MLN8237 alone rituximab . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 treatment group . COHORT A : Patients receive alisertib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1-7 . Patients unable achieve complete response ( CR ) course 4 also receive rituximab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 course 5-12 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . COHORT B : Patients receive alisertib Cohort A . Patients achieve stable disease ( SD ) asymptomatic progressive disease 2 course also receive rituximab IV day 1 course 3-10 . Patients unable achieve CR course 4 , receive rituximab Cohort A . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month .</detailed_description>
