	<detailed_description>Background Significance In United States , heart failure epidemic affect 5,700,000 people , estimate 100,000 200,000 suffer end-stage heart failure . Cardiac transplantation emerge definitive therapy patient end-stage heart failure . Cardiac allograft vasculopathy ( CAV ) major limitation longevity heart transplant ( HTx ) currently effective treatment . It affect 45 % transplant recipient year four post transplantation detectable intravascular ultrasound 75 % one year . Attempts prevent cardiac allograft vasculopathy modify traditional risk factor dyslipidemia hypertension result modest improvement outcomes transplant . The efficacy preventive measure limit multifactorial nature process influence nontraditional , less well-defined risk factor immune response , mode brain death donor , cytomegalovirus infection . Both traditional non-traditional risk factor share common final pathway , endothelial injury subsequent endothelial dysfunction . Endothelial dysfunction well describe precursor cardiac allograft vasculopathy cardiac transplant recipient . While endothelial dysfunction integral part development CAV one early manifestation , yet demonstrate target endothelial dysfunction delay prevents onset cardiac allograft vasculopathy . Thus study seek determine whether short-term sildenafil , administer first 3 year transplant , improve endothelial function heart transplant recipient thereby could prevent delay cardiac allograft vasculopathy ( CAV ) . Rationale use sildenafil Sildenafil demonstrate dilate epicardial coronary artery patient coronary artery disease normal coronary artery risk factor CAD demonstrate improve endothelial function variety cardiovascular disease include pulmonary hypertension heart failure . By inhibit PDE-5 , enzyme metabolizes cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( c-GMP ) , sildenafil enhances c-GMP-mediated relaxation inhibits proliferation vascular smooth-muscle cell . Inhibition PDE-5 receptor sildenafil appear selectively improve endothelial function epicardial artery ; patient severe CAD , sildenafil show improve coronary flow reserve . Based property , hypothesize PDE-5 inhibition improve endothelial function transplant recipient delay prevent onset vasculopathy Study Objectives To determine effect Sildenafil endothelial function cardiac transplant recipient : 1 . Measuring change radial artery elasticity HTx recipient Sildenafil therapy . 2 . Measuring change number endothelial progenitor cell Sildenafil therapy Study Design Overview Study Design This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled 16 week crossover design pilot study evaluate effect oral sildenafil 20mg t.i.d , small artery elasticity ( SAE ) endothelial cell heart transplant recipient . Subjects pre-randomization post treatment measurement peripheral artery elasticity endothelial progenitor cell Visits occur 0 , 4 , 8 , 12 16 week . A graphic presentation study show .</detailed_description>
