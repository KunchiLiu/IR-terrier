	<brief_summary>Although negative impact sleep apnea clinical course acute ischemic stroke ( AIS ) well know , data regard non-invasive ventilation acute patient scarce . Several study show tolerability , safety signals-of-efficacy , yet control randomize sequential phase study currently exist aim establish efficacy early non-invasive ventilation AIS patient . The main hypothesis study early non-invasive ventilation automate bilevel positive airway pressure ( auto-BPAP ) positively affect short-term clinical outcome AIS patient . This multicenter , prospective , randomize , control , third rater-blinded , parallel-group trial . Patients AIS proximal arterial obstruction clinically suspect sleep apnea randomize standard standard stroke care plus auto-BPAP . Auto-BPAP initiate within 24 hour stroke onset perform maximum 48 hour diurnal nocturnal sleep . Patients undergo cardiorespiratory polygraphy day 3 5 assess sleep apnea . The primary endpoint early neurological improvement NIHSS 72 hour randomization . Safety , tolerability , short-term 3 month functional outcome assess secondary endpoint un-blinded blind observer respectively . This study provide data power subsequent phase III study .</brief_summary>
