	<brief_title>Cabozantinib-S-Malate Treating Patients With Hormone-Resistant Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate timing , pathophysiology , magnitude change tumor image pharmacodynamic marker XL184 ( cabozantinib-s-malate ) treatment metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate progression-free survival ( PFS ) achieve XL184 metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) patient . II . To evaluate feasibility therapy , toxicity associate . III . To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) metastatic CRPC patient post androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) treat XL-184 . OUTLINE : Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally ( PO ) daily absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week periodically thereafter .</detailed_description>
