	<brief_summary>The study examine efficacy step care approach depress diabetes patient ( first study objective ) . 256 patient diabetes comorbid subthreshold clinical depression randomly assign either step care approach treatment-as-usual condition . The stepped care approach consist three treatment step comprise diabetes-specific cognitive-behavioral therapy ( CBT ) ( group ) , depression-specific CBT ( single ) , psychotherapeutic and/or psychiatric treatment ( single ) . Patients assign stepped care approach treat stepwise clinically significant reduction depressive symptom attain three treatment step pass . The primary outcome first study objective clinically significant reduction depressive symptom 12-month follow-up . Secondary outcome reduction diabetes-related distress improvement well-being , health-related quality life , diabetes acceptance , diabetes self-care , glycaemic control . Additionally , cost-benefit analysis perform . The second study objective analyse association diabetes , depression , serum level inflammatory marker . The third study objective analyse course depressive condition diabetes regard recovery rate incidence major depression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Compared person without diabetes , rate depressive disorder mood doubled diabetes patient . Epidemiologic study show point prevalence rate 10 - 14 % major depressive disorder additional proportion almost 20 % subthreshold depression ( define elevate depressive symptom without meet criterion specify clinical disorder ) . Depression subthreshold depression diabetes associate reduced quality life , increase diabetes-related distress , elevate health care cost . Furthermore , depression well subthreshold depression seem major barrier effective self-management disease associate reduced glycaemic control hyperglycaemia . Both condition seem independent prognostic factor subsequent morbidity mortality diabetes . Depressive condition commonly treat psychotherapeutic pharmacologic antidepressive therapy . Since majority diabetes patient suffer subthreshold depression , evaluate suitable specific intervention concept rare . Moreover , large variation symptom level depressive patient group suggest different type treatment different treatment intensity may require match individual demand . The issue 'optimal ' treatment also regard concern overtreatment undertreatment particular patient group depressive condition . Thus , successive order treatment step increase intensity appear useful . Since depression diabetes often associate high diabetes-related problem distress , diabetes-specific well depression-specific intervention may require . We develop step care approach three treatment step comprise diabetes-specific CBT ( group ) , depression-specific CBT ( single ) , psychotherapeutic and/or psychiatric treatment ( single ) . The study randomize efficacy trial efficacy step care approach compare treatment-as-usual condition ( standard diabetes education ) . 256 patient diabetes comorbid subthreshold clinical depression randomly assign either step care approach treatment-as-usual condition . Patients assign stepped care approach treat stepwise clinically significant reduction depressive symptom attain three treatment step pass . The primary outcome clinically significant reduction depressive symptom 12-month follow-up . Secondary outcome reduction diabetes-related distress improvement well-being , health-related quality life , diabetes acceptance , diabetes self-care , glycaemic control . The decisive measurement outcomes conduct 12 month treatment ( 12 month follow ) . Additionally , cost-benefit analysis perform . Besides test efficacy step care approach ( first objective ) , two additional study objective : The second study objective analyse association diabetes , depression , serum level inflammatory marker ( C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , Interleukin ( IL ) -6 , IL-18 , IL-1Ra , Adiponectin , Monocyte chemoattractant protein ( MCP ) -1 ) . Additionally , impact depression treatment level marker examine . The third study objective analyse course depressive condition diabetes regard recovery rate incidence major depression subclinically clinically depressed diabetes patient treat usual vs. give intervention .</detailed_description>
