	<brief_title>Pain Management Children Undergoing Supracondylar Humerus Fracture Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Forty six American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) class I II patient age 2 10 year undergoing reduction supracondylar humerus fracture enrol study . From mid-May beginning August , Lurie Children 's ( formerly Children 's Memorial Hospital ) historically 50-70 supracondylar humerus fracture child , expect 80 % recruitment rate study . A power analysis estimate sample size 46 patient would 80 % power 0.05 level significance detect 50 % reduction number patient require rescue medication compare intravenous opioids ultrasound-guided supraclavicular nerve block ( approximately 80 % 40 % ) . After obtain informed consent , patient take operate room procedure perform . Intraoperatively , patient randomly assign one two group . Randomization determine block allocation 1:1 ratio permute , mixed block 4 6 create randomly use computer base randomization table . Randomization perform one co-investigators . Preoperatively , patient assess neurovascular status test patient 's ability make three movement : thumb extension ( radial nerve ) , proximal interphalangeal joint ( PIP ) flexion ( median nerve ) , interossei function ( ulnar nerve ) . Patients may remove study consent give removal cast prior surgery reveals excessive swell elbow , indicate increase likelihood development compartment syndrome postoperatively . This determination make attend orthopaedic surgeon perform procedure . Patients increase likelihood develop compartment syndrome give narcotic treat pain . All patient undergo general anesthetic surgical procedure . Surgical anesthesia maintain use volatile anesthetic . Intraoperatively , still general anesthesia , Groups 1 2 receive standardize intravenous dose 0.05 mg/kg morphine total volume 1 ml . Following injection morphine , ultrasound-guided supraclavicular nerve catheter ( Angiocath ) place Group 2 . All catheter place one anesthesiologist train regional pain control use 25 mm linear US probe sterile fashion . Patients take postoperative recovery room ( PACU ) area test nerve function emergence anesthesia . If examination unchanged preoperative assessment , injection block use 5 ml 0.25 % bupivacaine 1:200,000 epinephrine administer . Bupivacaine long act local anesthetic prevents nerve conduction action potential initiation decrease permeability neuronal membrane sodium . We use maximum dose 5 mL 0.25 % bupivacaine , usually base dose ml/kg ( 0.2 ml/kg ) maximum dose exceed 2.5 mg/kg . This well toxic level . A band-aid placed patient supraclavicular nerve block would insert , parent ask leave band-aid 3 day maintain blindness treatment type patient . In PACU , patient evaluate pain discomfort member research team use `` Faces Pain Scale-Revised ( FPS-R ) '' Other side effect nausea , vomit , somnolence respiratory depression note . Any incidence nausea and/or vomit treat 0.1 mg/kg ( 4 mg ) ondansetron give intravenously . The postoperative care unit staff well verse keep child calm anesthesia . There chance child may know group . However , due age child fact come anesthesia , likely understand happen implication intervention . It also unlikely affect outcome require additional medication pain PACU home . Likewise , unlikely know group would affect range motion outcome . Families randomly contact 7 time 36 hour approximately operation nurse Collaborative Research Unit ( CRU ) record patient 's pain score . Data analyze use time series analysis . Patients discharge standardized 5/325 mg dose Norco take every 4-6 hour . Patients typically discharge day brief overnight stay . Patients typically follow 1 week radiograph treat orthopaedic surgeon follow pin removal 3-4 week post-surgery . PT begin less 100 degree arc motion 6 week pin removal involve ROM exercise per PT discretion . A binary outcome record whether PT necessary 6 week cast pin remove . Functional recovery measure 6 week pin removal ROM measurement . A pain score also take follow-up visit 6 week pin removal measure long-term pain . Parents give questionnaire child discharge hospital . Part questionnaire fill child still hospital . The rest questionnaire send home parent fill throughout week follow operation . The content questionnaire explain parent time questionnaire hand ensure understand question . Parents return questionnaire 1 week follow visit give feedback data postoperative discomfort , additional pain medication also overall satisfaction study design . All data obtain enter Excel® database . Statistical analysis carry use SPSS software® ( Statistical Program Social Sciences ) , t-test perform data obtain . Primary outcome data use rescue medication immediate postoperative period . Secondary outcome include pain score , use additional medication leave hospital range motion 9-10 week postoperatively . Analyzed data include duration pain relief retention nerve functionality . We also record analyze incidence postoperative vomit respiratory distress either group . We carefully monitor record development compartment syndrome .</detailed_description>
