It look way manage weight gain pregnancy may affect baby health birth first year . Researchers want recruit pregnant woman treat Phoenix Indian Medical Center . They participate two-part study . Objectives : - To study pregnant woman LIFE-Moms project Phoenix Indian Medical Center . Eligibility : - Pregnant woman least 18 year age overweight obese . - Participants must receive care Phoenix Indian Medical Center . - Participants must one child pregnancy ( twin multiple birth ) . Design : - This study two part . The first part three visit obtain data health early pregnancy . It also let participant researcher find participant eligible continue second part study . In second part , participant monitor throughout pregnancy first year baby birth test effect lifestyle intervention control weight gain pregnancy . - On Part 1 study visit , participant physical exam medical history . They provide blood , urine , hair , sample examine possible genetic condition . - For Part 2 study visit , participant place one two treatment group . Each group receive prenatal postnatal care would get join study . - The first group lifestyle intervention program . They spend 2 hour every week member group learn diet activity behavior may help health . - The second group enhance care program .

	<detailed_description>LIFE-Moms ( Phoenix center ) randomize clinical trial overweight obese pregnant woman test effect intensive lifestyle intervention gestational weight gain , control maternal hyperglycemia , post-partum return pre-pregnancy weight . The Phoenix center conduct collaboration Phoenix Indian Medical Center ( PIMC ) nurse midwifery obstetrics service National Institute Diabetes Digestive Kidney Diseases ( NIDDK ) . It part LIFE-Moms Consortium consist six clinical center follow similar protocol research coordination unit . American Indians high risk develop obesity type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) complication . A major factor responsible finding exposure fetus womb mother diabetes , increase risk diabetes offspring particularly childhood adolescence . This study design evaluate effect intensive lifestyle intervention ( ILI ) least 200 adult ( age great equal 18 year ) pregnant woman eligible prenatal care PIMC . Interventions provide overweight obese pregnant woman pregestational diabetes may ( GDM ) , i.e. , diabetes first develops first recognize pregnancy , high risk develop GDM . The lifestyle intervention pattern Diabetes Prevention Program ( DPP ) prevent delayed onset diabetes non pregnant adult ; intervention modify appropriate pregnancy . For woman develop diabetes , intervention include coach optimize glycemic control . Women randomly assign one two intervention group , assign equal probability : enhanced standard care group intensive lifestyle intervention group ( ILI ) . Following delivery , mother infant treat way regardless initial treatment group . For example , mother encourage breast feed follow recommend practice health baby . After delivery mother invite bring infant research clinic five time first 6 month 1 year age . These follow visit infant time 1 ) understand pattern change neonatal body composition 2 ) coincide , possible , well-child pediatric visit . We also question mother abstract data medical record regard child feeding practice , overall health , hospitalization , immunization , medicine use . Outcomes assess schedule intervention group . Prenatal measurement include demographic , anthropometric , biochemical data . The latter focus periodic measure relate blood glucose ( sugar ) , include glucose tolerance test . Diet physical activity assess questionnaire objective activity monitor . Many test repeat mother 6-12 week 12 month post-partum . Infant data shortly birth month 1 6 12 include weight , length , head size , estimate body fat , feed practice , medical record abstraction .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : Adult pregnant woman race ethnicity may participate meet follow inclusion criterion : 1 . At least 18 year age . 2 . Receive prenatal care nurse midwifery/obstetrics service PIMC plan continue receive care throughout pregnancy . 3 . Able OGTT prior 16 week gestation . Hyperemesis preclude pregnant woman successfully complete OGTT ; woman exclude fast blood sample obtain . 4 . Able ultrasound examination estimate fetal age . 5 . Complete initial runin screen visit determine whether woman manage task require participation intensive intervention randomize intervention group . 6 . Able commit time require intervention followup . 7 . Singleton viable pregnancy . A twin pregnancy reduce singleton 14 ( 0 ) week project gestational age acceptable . An ultrasound must conduct randomization show fetal heartbeat ; evidence one fetus recent prerandomization ultrasound . 8 . Gestational age randomization earlier 9 week 0 day later 15 ( 6 ) week base algorithm compare LMP date data early ultrasound . 9 . Body mass index great equal 25 kilogram / square meter base first trimester measure weight measure height . The early weight measurement randomization , measure specifically study , use . Reported prepregnancy weight use determine eligibility potential inaccuracy . If early weight measurement conduct 14 ( 0 ) 14 ( 6 ) week 15 ( 0 ) 15 ( 6 ) week , 1 pound 2 pound subtract measure weight , respectively , adjust first trim weight . This weight resultant BMI define baseline weight BMI , respectively . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Diagnosis diabetes prior pregnancy follow result oral glucose tolerance test visit # 1 suggest diabetes prior pregnancy : HbA1c great equal 6.5 % , FPG great equal 126 milligram per deciliter , 2hour postload plasma glucose great equal 200 milligram per deciliter ( 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test ) . All potential participant HbA1c 75 grams oral glucose tolerance test perform prior randomization . Women meet criterion diagnose presumed diabetes prior pregnancy exclude . Others meet criterion GDM eligible . Criteria GDM diagnosis base ADA 2012 criterion ( least one FPG great equal 92 milligram per deciliter , 1 hour PG great equal 180 milligram per deciliter , 2 hour PG great equal 153 milligram per deciliter . ) Known fetal anomaly Planned termination pregnancy History three consecutive first trimester miscarriage Past history anorexia bulimia medical history patient report . Binge eat disorder ( BED ) exclusion . Current eating disorder diagnose EDEQ question 24 confirmed discussion participant study staff Actively suicidal define value great equal 2 BDIII question 9 Prior plan ( within 1 year expect delivery ) bariatric surgery Current use one follow medication : Metformin Systemic steroid Antipsychotic agent ( e.g. , Abilify ( apriprazole ) , Haldol ( haloperidol ) , Risperdal ( resperidone ) , Seroquel ( quetipapine ) , Zyprexa ( olanzapine ) ) Antiseizure medication mood stabilizer would expect significant impact body weight ( e.g. , Depakote ( valproic acid ) , Lamictal ( lamotrigine ) , Lithium , Neurontin ( gabapentin ) , Tegretol ( carbamazepine ) , Topamax ( topiramate ) , Keppra ( levetiracetam ) Medications ADHD include amphetamine methylphenidate Any teratogenic agent Class D X ( site specific ) Continued use weight loss medication include OTC dietary supplement weight loss ( e.g. , Adipex ( phentermine ) , Suprenza ( phentermine ) Tenuate ( dietheylpropion ) , Xenical ( orlistat ) , Alli ( orlistat ) , conjugate linoleic acid , Hoodia , Green tea extract , Guar gum , HydroxyCut , Sensa , Cortislim , Chromium , chitosan , Bitter orange ) Contraindications aerobic exercise pregnancy specify ACOG Committee Opinion # 267 , 2002 Hemodynamically significant heart disease define AHA class II ( short breath exercise ) great Restrictive lung disease ( e.g . pulmonary fibrosis ) Poorly control hyperthyroidism Poorly control seizure disorder Poorly control hypertension define blood pressure great equal 160/110 millimeter mercury History extreme sedentary lifestyle ( e.g . bed bound ) Orthopedic limitation aerobic exercise Severe anemia define hemoglobin less 8 gram per deciliter Any condition require followup specialty care clinic outside PIMC ( e.g. , pregnancy high risk maternal fetal demise ) Participation another interventional study influence weight control Enrollment trial previous pregnancy Intention participant care provider delivery outside great Phoenix metropolitan area . Participant unwillingness inability commit 1 year followup child , include plan move away . Inability unwillingness provide inform consent , English language , include consent study staff abstract data prenatal delivery record ( current pregnancy ) whether care delivery occur PIMC elsewhere .
