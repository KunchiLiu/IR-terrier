	<brief_summary>This feasibility study allow determination vivo recovery time dialysis optimize future thorough microdialysis study . This single session , open label study evaluate feasibility microdialysis Retapamulin healthy subject . Three healthy subject enrol complete study procedure . Subjects admit research unit Day 1 three microdialysis probe place thigh subject prior start microdialysis procedure . After normal saline solution infusion 30 minute , Retapamulin solution infuse 90 minute . Saline perfusion occur washout period . Microdialysis sample do 30 minute ( last 30 minute drug perfusion ) dialysate sample collection continue every 30 minute 4 hour . The approximate duration study include follow-up 4 day .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Healthy determine responsible experienced physician , base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test . A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter outside reference range population study may include Investigator GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) Medical Monitor agree find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . Subjects clinically significant lab value outside normal range always exclude enrollment . The subject able understand comply protocol requirement , instruction protocolstated restriction likely complete study plan . Subject willing provide inform consent . Does use medication contain Retapamulin participate study . Male female 18 55 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . Body Mass Index within range 18.5 32 kilogram/ meter^2 ( inclusive ) . The follow normal range blood pressure heart rate give guide : Systolic blood pressure 90 140 milimeter Mercury ( mmHg ) , Diastolic blood pressure 60 90 mmHg , Heart rate 45 100 beat per minute ( bpm ) . The investigator may interpret screen vital sign data base subject 's age , physical state level fitness . Subjects vital sign reading marginally outside normal range may include study investigator 's opinion value clinically significant present safety risk affect study assessment . A female subject eligible participate nonchildbearing potential ( define premenopausal female document tubal ligation hysterectomy ; postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea [ questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone &gt; 40 milli international unit/mililiter ( mL ) estradiol &lt; 40 picogram/ml [ &lt; 147 picomoles/Liter ] confirmatory ] . Females hormone replacement therapy whose menopausal status doubt require use one contraception method ) Childbearing potential agrees use one contraception method appropriate period time ( determined product label investigator ) prior start dose sufficiently minimize risk pregnancy point . Female subject must agree use contraception study completion ( i.e . followup phone call ) . Male subject female partner childbearing potential must agree use one contraception method . This criterion must follow time first dose study medication study completion ( i.e . followup phone call ) . Alanine aminotransferase , alkaline phosphatase bilirubin &lt; = 1.5x Upper limit normal ( ULN ) ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 percent ) . QT interval correct Heart rate ( QTc ) , QTcB ( Bazett 's formula ) QTcF ( Fridericia 's formula ) &lt; 450 millisecond ( msec ) ; QTc &lt; 480 msec subject Bundle Branch Block . Does currently smoke cigarette tobacco smoke within past 12 month prior study . Does consume alcohol 72 hour prior start study Unwillingness inability follow procedure outline protocol Subject mentally legally incapacitate . History current significant medical illness include cardiovascular thrombotic event , myocardial infarction , stroke cardiac disease , hypertension , peptic ulcer disease gastrointestinal bleeding , skin disorder , hematological disease , bronchospastic respiratory disease , asthma , diabetes mellitus , renal hepatic insufficiency , illness investigator deem clinically significant exclusion subject study . History sensitivity study medication , component thereof history drug allergy , opinion investigator GSK Medical Monitor , contraindicate participation . History skin condition include atopic dermatitis , dry skin , ichtyosis vulgaris . Surgical history within 3 month prior start study . Clinically significant acute illness 7 day prior study start . Excessive hair , tattoo , scar tissue , tissue damage application site could affect drug recovery patient safety . Use topical moisturizers ( include facial moisturizers ) 48 hour start study . Strenuous exercise 48 hour start study . Unable refrain use nonprescription drug , include non steroidal antinflammatory drug ( NSAIDS ) , vitamin , herbal dietary supplement ( include St John 's Wort ) within 7 day ( 14 day drug potential enzyme inducer ) 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study medication , unless opinion Investigator GSK Medical Monitor medication interfere study procedure compromise subject safety . History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study define average weekly intake &gt; 14 drink male &gt; 7 drink female . One drink equivalent 12 gram alcohol : 12 ounce ( 360mL ) beer ; 5 ounce ( 150mL ) wine ; 1.5 ounce ( 45mL ) 80 proof distil spirit . A positive prestudy drug/alcohol screen . Pregnant female determine positive serum human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) screen urine hCG test prior dose . Lactating female . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first dose day current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Exposure four new chemical entity within 12 month prior first dose day . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day period .
