	<brief_title>Progressive Resistance Training Extensor Muscle Thigh COPD-patients Hospitalized With Exacerbation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) one costly chronic disease ( 1 ) . In Denmark estimate approximately 400.000 people suffers COPD amount 15 % adult population . COPD cause 10.000 visit emergency room , approx . 25.000 acute admission hospital 3.500 death year . The disease cost approx 2 billion Danish croners ( 400 million dollar ) year . Hospital admission due exacerbation add costly part disease burden society . COPD one chronic disease still rise ( 1 ) . COPD characterize accelerated decline lung function . Most patient severe degree COPD suffer recurrent acute deterioration name exacerbation . An exacerbation define deterioration symptom include shortness breath sputum production lead chance medical treatment . Frequent exacerbation associate extra high rate decline lung function strongly negative impact quality life . The disease progression follow gradual loss muscle mass strength ( 3 ) . Admission hospital well know effect maximal oxygen consumption reduction physical condition lead severe degree shortness breath physical activity ( 4 ) . Just day bed followed important loss muscle mass strength . Immobilization cause decrease metabolism loss active motor unit reduce ability activate rest motor unit . This great negative impact strength extensor engage maintain upright position muscle group . In keep , loss muscle strength occur twice high rate muscle low limb upper limb ( 5 ) . This lead increased production lactic acid correspond muscle fatique ( 6 ) . Muscles engage knee extension loose strength high rate immobilization . This loss great impact activity daily life get bed , rise chair climb stair . Even though patient regain premorbide lung function symptom improve `` normal '' level usually within 6 week , reach habitual level physical activity express 6MWT ( 7 ) . Admittance due exacerbation follow muscle waste prolonged inactivity , lead increase risk recurrent exacerbation . Physical training muscle efficient treatment maintain increase muscle strength prevent muscle waste immobilization . Since decline muscle strength occur first day bed rest - 3-4 % per day - pronounce muscle low limb , god reason early intervention physical training extensor low limb , early admittance , well . There solid evidence positive effect train clinically stable COPD patient . Only two study investigate effect training admittance acute exacerbation ( 8 ) In study Troosters , train consist 3 set 8 repetition amount 70 % 1 repetition maximum ( 1RM : repetition maximum : maximal weight handle one time ) . The subject FEV1 40 ± 12 % predict , train use knee extension machine . We know exact exclusion criterion study - include patient unable move bed knee extension machine ? Did physiotherapists handle severely diseased patient differently ? Moreover , would general applicable , training could perform less demand expensive equipment knee extension machine . Accordingly , need study detailed description training procedure , use simple , low cost training device , applicable many center hospital unit . Most patient suffer severe degree COPD ( GOLD III IV ) ( 3 ) experience severe shortness breath lead exhaustion even low level activity . Unilateral resistance training quadriceps use wrist weight low cost , low technology . The pilot study department pulmonary medicine , Frederikssund Hospital , include 8 severely diseased COPD patient , trained wrist weight average 5 day , show patient improved muscle strength - amounting average 50 % . The study show progressive low limb muscle exercise possible even severely disabled patient home oxygen . We know surprisingly high degree improvement ascribe training factor . Accordingly , want perform randomize control single blind study clarify progressive resistance training wrist weight improve strength large extensor muscle lower limb degree translate improve physical ability discharge hospital . Randomizing The investigation design randomize , control , single blind study . Patients fulfill inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion invite participate study . After initial evaluation test patient randomize either standard pulmonary physiotherapy physical training ( intervention group ) standard physiotherapy without training ( control group ) . The list randomization base computer program . Numbers randomization keep 70 closed envelope . The content envelope disclose inclusion , initial evaluation testing . The envelope number outside ( consecutive line number different number randomization ) keep secretary release order outside number . Tests inclusion 6 week perform physiotherapist blind randomization . It impossible blind physician , nurse physiotherapist pulmonary ward . Security Ethics Based current evidence , patient expose kind risk , except slight degree muscle soreness may occur follow first day physical training . The study blind physiotherapist perform training , problem relate training occur , easily address . The present study aim progressive physical training cheap equipment easy handle physiotherapist patient minimal risk patient . This add importance study . The control group treat accord usual therapeutic guideline . The study report local ethical committee . The patient cover patient insurance Frederikssund Hospital . Registration data inform consent Data evaluation agree technical demand make Danish Data Protection Agency The patient familiar collect data , information include informed consent . All data study keep separate locked container lock room . Only principal investigator access room container . Data store excel , every patient unique number date particular patient store number . The security container obtain specific purpose study accordance procedure local region regard login internet . The patient contact principal investigator another member staff adequately train study within 24 hour admittance pulmonary ward Frederikssund Hospital . The patient receive oral information information writing study day admittance , right voluntary scientific study field health science . The patient inform nature study accord guideline The Danish Council Ethics . The oral information guide information writing , every aspect study explain detail patient . Informed consent obtain day information minimum 24 hour reconsideration . The patient decide withdraw study time investigation . The investigator also decide patient withdrawn study reason exclusion document research file . Statistics The primary aim study compare strength extensor thigh intervention group control group isometric contraction test . Calculations show need 35 subject group able reveal difference strength least 30 % , limit statistical significance 5 % power 80 % . The power calculation base expect change extension strength start study discharge expect control group improve strength . . The applied statistical analysis ( SPSS ) repeat measure ( ANOVA ) determine systematic difference muscle strenght without quadriceps train . Measurements All participant test late day one admittance , discharge hospital outpatient basis 6 week later . The day admittance denote day 0 . The 6 week follow chosen due belief COPD patient clinically stable 6 week exacerbation . Economy Time schedule The study start person responsible investigation . The study yet fully finance . We plan apply additional finalcial support . None foundation connection drug industry none possible supporter impact result , interpretation publication . The study start autumn 2012 finish 70 COPD patient include follow , hopefully finish autumn 2013 . The result study positive , negative inconclusive report international journal pulmonary medicine .
