	<brief_summary>Radical cystectomy remain gold standard treatment invasive non metastatic transitional cell cancer ( TCC ) bladder . In contemporary series , specific survival rate 60 65 % 5 year , decrease locally advanced disease 45-50 % patient nonorgan-confined lymph-node negative tumour 30-35 % patient lymph node positive tumour . Perioperative chemotherapy ( adjuvant ou neoadjuvant ) develop order improve result . Thanks randomize trial meta-analysis , conclude perioperative chemotherapy increase overall survival absolute benefit 5 % , equate survival rate 50 % 5 year nonorgan-confined tumour . However , chemotherapy administration time optimal chemotherapy regimen deliver yet determine . Meta-analyses show benefit observe chemotherapy regimen include cisplatin . In daily management 4 6 cycle gemcitabine cisplatin deliver since combination show yield similar efficacy well tolerance compare MVAC regimen ( methotrexate , vinblastine , doxorubicin cisplatin ) metastatic setting . As HD-MVAC show associate high response rate MVAC bladder metastatic disease , also well efficacy HD-MVAC suspect perioperative setting . Investigators therefore design randomized phase III study compare efficacy GC HD-MVAC term progression-free survival patient chemotherapy decide , radical cystectomy . Secondary endpoint include overall survival , side effect , response rate neoadjuvant set ancillary study focus gemcitabine cisplatin sensitivity . The total number patient project 500 . The number patient base median progression-free survival rate 50 % 3 year observe patient treat GC ( standard arm A ) perioperative set . An absolute improvement 10 % ( HR=0.74 ) expect HD-MVAC ( experimental arm B ) a=0.05 b=0.20 . An interim analysis plan occurrence 174 event . With estimate uniform accrual rate 140 patient per year 3.5 year exponential survival , final analysis expect occur 8 year start trial .</brief_summary>
