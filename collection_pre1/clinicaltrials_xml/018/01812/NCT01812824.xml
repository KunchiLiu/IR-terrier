In RCT , half participant sign use Gabby system ( intervention ) half use Gabby system ( control ) . Outcomes assessed via 6 month follow-up phone call , take approximately one hour . Secondary outcome include : pregnancy rate , Risk Profile participant become pregnant , participant satisfaction , number story write heard .

Subjects complete demographic form use RCT , test various component system - include risk assessment , risk dialogue ( `` script '' Gabby ) , My Health To-Do List , story author . This allow investigator fully test complete system member target group , debug , populate system additional story receive feedback work . The objective perform check system logic , content , usability software . The goal ensure system work design . Northeastern investigator present full system pre-testing order assist technical issue order observe system use identify problem fix prior RCT . After user test system , Dr. Yinusa-Nyahkoon , experience African American investigator , conduct one-on-one interview subject last approximately 30 minute . Dr. Yinusa-Nyahkoon use semi-structured interview guide ask question subject ' perception system gather suggestion improvement . All focus group individual interview audio record transcribed verbatim ; participant inform audio recording prior sign consent form . Research team member review transcript change subject name alter identify information order honor subject confidentiality . Audio file interview password protect , paper copy interview transcript assign subject identification number . Analysis interview data begin first focus group interview complete ; therefore , data collection analysis occur simultaneously , new point inquiry subsequent interview generate . Grounded theory technique use analyze interview data . Content category , pattern , theme identify across interview data , support evidence transcript review research team member corroborate finding . This process , refer researcher triangulation , provide mechanism reflect , confirm , expand data interpretation . The following information collect Pretesting subject : ( 1 ) Screening Form determine eligibility ( Form A ) ; ( 2 ) Signed consent form ; ( 3 ) Contact Information Sheet ( Form C ) ; ( 4 ) Subject sociodemographics ( Form C ) ; ( 5 ) Health literacy test 66 word version Rapid Estimate Adult Literacy Medicine ( REALM ) ; ( 6 ) Multidimensional Scale Perceived Social Support ; ( 7 ) Everyday Discrimination Scale ; ( 8 ) Social Networking Immersion Measure ; ( 9 ) General Self-Efficacy Scale ; ( 10 ) Contraceptive Knowledge Pre-Test ; ( 11 ) Nutrition Knowledge Pre-Test .

The investigator work OMH , send recruitment email contact list complete PPE training , inform study provide contact information Program Manager . If interested , potential subject email Program Manager receive information study set phone call complete screen enrollment process give verbal consent . Potential subject email consent form REALM form prior phone call , well fly basic study information , instruct access computer phone call . Inclusion Enrollment Procedures .
