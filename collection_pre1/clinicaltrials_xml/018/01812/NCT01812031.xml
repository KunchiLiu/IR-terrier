	<brief_summary>Fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) widely use cancer image purpose , notably preoperative work-up . It aim visualize organ metabolism . In case cancer , metabolism , classically , increase hot spot visible PET image . Because respiratory motion lung tumour ( especially small one ) falsely interpreted clinician . The investigator develop respiratory-gated PET method order reduce motion issue . The investigator design study investigate effect lung cancer ( primary metastasis ) check improve sensitivity/specificity PET imaging lung . To aim , patient present lung nodule CT examination propose participate study . After standard PET acquisition ( acquire free-breathing ) , additional 10 minute respiratory-gated PET acquisition perform without additional injection . After , breath-hold ( ~10s ) CT perform .</brief_summary>
