	<detailed_description>Patients receive Sativex dose-intense Temozolomide open-label phase . The incidence adverse event monitor ( Part A ) . An investigator lead Safety Review Team ass safety profile open-label patient decide whether study progress randomisation phase ( Part B ) . Patients enrol randomisation phase patient receive either Sativex placebo . The safety Sativex compare placebo assess pharmacokinetic analysis Temozolomide metabolites , clinical laboratory test , adverse event vital sign .</detailed_description>
