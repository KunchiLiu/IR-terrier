	<brief_summary>The aim study compare predictive validity reliability PEth test detect alcohol use post liver transplant patient . A prospective cohort study use test primary hypothesis . Subjects enrol study follow 12 month biomarker level draw baseline , six 12 month . The baseline interview inquire previous 30 day alcohol tobacco use ; lifetime 12 month Diagnostic Statistical Manual-IV criterion alcohol abuse and/or dependence ; prior alcohol treatment ; history abstinence prior transplant ; co-morbid medical issue ; depression . The six 12 month interview focus previous 30 day alcohol use . The baseline , six 12 month interview conduct face-to-face site . While many patient receive transplant live near academic medical center perform surgery patient , normally transplant clinic visit 1-2 time per year . Medical record transplant database assess assess variable interest .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients positive PEth ask confirmatory test perform 10-14 day positive result ( PEth &gt; 20ng/ml ) . The rationale procedure determine test retest reliability marker well able correlate level drink change biomarker level time . There limited information length time PEth level remain elevated transplant patient drink episode . Hypothesis H.1 . PEth significantly high `` area Receiver Operating Characteristic ( ROC ) curve '' sample post-transplant patient report alcohol use past 30 day compare control group . H.2 . PEth significantly high `` area ROC curve '' sample post-transplant patient report daily alcohol use &gt; 40 grams/day ( three drinks/day ) past 30 day compare control group . H.3 . PEth significantly high `` area ROC curve '' sample post-transplant patient report heavy episodic drinking ( &gt; 60 gram alcohol , eight occasion past 30 day ) compare control group . H.4 . PEth level &lt; 20 ng/ml control sample 50 post transplant patient history alcohol dependence alcohol relate liver disease . H.5 . The test-retest reliability PEth &gt; 0.90 .</detailed_description>
