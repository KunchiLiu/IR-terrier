	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare post-cesarean section consumption pain medication two group patient undergo scheduled cesarean section term gestation receive single-dose intraoperative steroid ( dexamethasone 8 milligram ) versus placebo 24 hour surgery . The hypothesis single perioperative dose dexamethasone 8 mg significantly reduce postoperative opioid consumption 24 h woman cesarean delivery spinal anesthesia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dexamethasone Post-cesarean Delivery Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Steroids use reduce inflammation tissue damage variety condition , potent immunomodulatory effect , mainstay treatment acute allograft rejection . Dexamethasone show safe effective anti-emetic therapy patient undergoing cesarean section surgery spinal anesthesia contain morphine . However , recent evidence suggest dexamethasone may also play role reduce post-operative pain opioid consumption . Early study patient undergo dental procedure show glucocorticoid effective reduce postoperative pain edema . Multiple recent study also investigate potential analgesic benefit single perioperative dose dexamethasone , result inconsistent . The effect single-dose , intraoperative , intravenous dexamethasone therapy post-operative pain opioid consumption yet study patient undergoing cesarean section . Pain significant source morbidity many woman follow cesarean section , serious consequence beyond immediate post-operative period . Patients poorly-controlled pain may difficulty ambulation lead atelectasis , pneumonia , venous thromboembolism . Poor maternal pain control may also affect infant interfere bond breastfeeding . Reduction post-operative opioid consumption desirable may also reduce incidence opioid-induced side effect sedation , constipation , nausea , vomit pruritus . Some evidence suggest severity post-operative pain follow cesarean section may predict progression chronic pain , postpartum depression . Although 10 18 % woman undergo cesarean section experience chronic pain follow surgery , difficult predict patient experience complication . Recent investigation show patient response standardize painful stimulus prior surgery help predict severity post-operative pain possibly progression chronic pain . This type information could potentially help tailor clinical management patient risk severe and/or chronic post-operative pain improve outcome patient . Landau colleague describe simple minimally-invasive method assess response noxious stimulus use von-Frey filament obtain mechanical temporal summation score .</detailed_description>
