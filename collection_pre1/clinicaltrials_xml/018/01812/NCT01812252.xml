	<brief_summary>This randomize clinical trial study different chemotherapy treat patient myelodysplastic syndrome donor stem cell transplant . Giving chemotherapy donor stem cell transplant help stop growth cancer cell bone marrow , include normal blood-forming cell ( stem cell ) cancer cell , may prevent myelodysplastic syndrome come back transplant . When healthy stem cell donor infused patient may help patient 's bone marrow make stem cell , red blood cell , white blood cell , platelet .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine effect induction chemotherapy ( IC ) ( intensive acute myeloid leukemia [ AML ] -like therapy ) , versus less intensive hypomethylating agent ( HMA ) initial therapy , failure-free survival . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine IC ( intensive AML-like therapy ) comparison HMA initial therapy , affect transplantation frequency quality life . II . Conduct exploratory analysis post-HCT outcome ( overall survival , relapse ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive decitabine azacitidine intravenously ( IV ) subcutaneously ( SC ) 7 day . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course decitabine 6 course azacitidine absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients receive induction-like chemotherapy per standard care per experimental protocol . This study require specific chemotherapy regimen Arm B . After completion study treatment , patient follow 18 month .</detailed_description>
