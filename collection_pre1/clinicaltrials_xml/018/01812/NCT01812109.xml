	<brief_title>Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Pediatric Acute Scrotum Testicular Torsion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The main goal prospective , non-randomized pilot study assess utility NIRS clinical diagnosis acute scrotum testicular torsion . Near-Infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) simple non-invasive technique ass oxygen saturation deeper body tissue . It variety adult pediatric human health application test testicular torsion . Investigators propose evaluate usefulness modality human testicular torsion . The overall objective specific aim : 1 ) To evaluate utility NIRS diagnosis testicular torsion versus cause acute scrotum , 2 ) To assess sensitivity specificity Doppler/ B-mode Ultrasound versus NIRS , 3 ) To evaluate utility NIRS intraoperative postoperative test predict testicular viability surgical detorsion.The sensitivity specificity NIRS testicular torsion define relative surgical exploration , scrotal Doppler/B-mode ultrasound , clinical follow-up . Last , investigator assess utility intraoperative postoperative NIRS predict testicular viability testicular detorsion . To achieve , standard care provide patient two five time point NIRS measurement obtain blind fashion standard care bias NIRS data . Outcome variable include NIRS StO2 measurement , torsion status ( yes/no ) , ultrasound parameter ( testicular size , volume , echogenicity , presence/absence Doppler flow , whirlpool sign , hydrocele , scrotal wall thickness ) duration pain , duration torsion . Study endpoint include early withdrawal , screen failure , orchiectomy torsion , 1 week 3 month post-surgical follow-up . In 5 year single center study , maximum number local subject consent 750 subject . No exist chart use prospective study . Patients acute scrotum evaluate history , physical examination , urinalysis per standard care staff ER , pediatric urology pediatric surgery . A gray scale/color Doppler testicular ultrasound surgical exploration perform next step per standard care . While wait next step , patient guardian inform invite study participation . Those refuse study participation receive standard care treatment acute scrotum . Those accept study participation inform consent receive standard care therapy acute scrotum evaluate NIRS . At time point study , NIRS measurement blind researcher manufacturer 's computer software place NIRS database . Thus , NIRS measurements bias clinical care , permit standard care treatment unbiased . The clinical data collection sheet complete prospectively patient ( attachment ) enter non-NIRS database . While wait gray scale/color Doppler testicular ultrasound surgical exploration , NIRS # 1 measurement obtain . NIRS # 1 series 6 transcutaneous scrotal measurement , three leave three right . Each measurement completely non-invasive , painless take ~15 second . Thus , sedation supplemental analgesia need NIRS . The NIRS probe place anterior , lateral posterior scrotum leave right side , immediately overlie parallel long axis testis skin , obtain six total measurement . Thus , unaffected testis serve patient 's control . In study , study coordinator perform ER transscrotal NIRS testing . To achieve uniform testing , train testicular probe placement method . NIRS # 1 delay gray scale/color Doppler testicular ultrasound surgery . If surgeon decides surgical exploration , standard care cause acute scrotum provide , diagnosis testicular torsion patient discharge home standard care 1 week follow-up outpatient urology clinic appointment . If gray scale/color Doppler testicular ultrasound identifies testicular torsion , emergent surgical exploration perform . At surgery general anesthesia per standard care , NIRS # 2 perform . NIRS # 2 series 9 testicular tissue measurement perform sterile , six affect testis three unaffected testis . The affected testis receive six measurement first set three immediately testis expose still testicular torsion second set three measurement 5 minute testis detorsed . NIRS # 1 NIRS # 2 measurement different ; NIRS # 1 measurement testis scrotal skin ( transcutaneous ) NIRS # 2 measurement skin directly obtain expose testis without testicular puncture . The probe lay expose testis intraoperative testicular tissue ) scrotum surgically open . Each measurement painless take ~15 second . The NIRS probe place anterior , lateral posterior testis obtain three set three measurement . Thus , unaffected testis serve patient 's control . NIRS # 2 delay detorsion affect testis . Surgeons blind NIRS result special software well , thus decision operation affect . If testicular torsion find detorsed testis deem nonviable , orchiectomy contralateral orchiopexy perform . The patient discharge home reach study endpoint . If testicular torsion find torsed testis viable detorsion , bilateral orchiopexy perform standard . One hour NIRS # 2 measurement complete , NIRS # 3 perform use method describe NIRS # 1 postsurgical patient go bilateral orchiopexy testicular salvage . One week later , non-surgical patient surgical patient bilateral orchiopexy return outpatient urology clinic evaluation ~1 hour duration . 1 . After standard care clinical evaluation , diagnosis still testicular torsion , patient discharge home reach study endpoint . 2 . After standard care clinical evaluation , clinical concern testicular viability ( missed testicular torsion ) , repeat standard care gray scale/color Doppler testicular ultrasound obtain immediately NIRS # 4 perform use method describe NIRS # 1 . The patient categorize torsion torsion base clinical finding reach study endpoint . 3 . As per standard care , testicular torsion present testis underwent detorsion orchiopexy , NIRS # 4 perform use method describe NIRS # 1 . At 3 month postoperatively , gray scale/color Doppler testicular ultrasound obtain assess testicular volume dimension . The affected testis categorize normal , &lt; 20 % testicular volume loss , 20-50 % volume loss , &gt; 50 % volume loss base ultrasound parameter . At ~1 hour visit , NIRS # 5 perform use method describe NIRS # 1 patient reach study endpoint . If patient return designate one week three month follow-up outpatient urology clinic evaluation , PI and/or research nurse coordinator telephone guardian encourage return clinic verbal status report child 's clinical state . Thus total number study visit , include present emergency visit , three ( Emergency , 1 week post-operatively , 3 month post-operatively ) . No medication administer study . No blood tissue collect radiation exposure questionnaires give . No subject responsible research-related cost ; however , responsible standard care cost . At end study , standard care turn primary care physician pediatric urologist need . No sub-study procedure perform .</detailed_description>
