	<brief_summary>Background : - The purpose study find whether color vision measure Cambridge Color Test good way examine severity inherit retinal disease ( IRDs ) . IRDs major cause vision loss worldwide , little known disease affect color vision time . This study tell u color vision may use track change inherit retinal disease time . Objectives : - To improve understand color vision way measure change inherit retinal disease . Eligibility : - People 5 year age old IRD . - Healthy volunteer least 5 year age . Design : - Participants make least one visit National Eye Institute clinic . If sign test , may three visit NEI clinic . - Participants ask question medical eye history . - Participants give eye exam , include eye drop dilate pupil . They take Cambridge Color Test , include look monitor press button , arrange colored circle . Several test may offer , participant decline take . - Treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The aim study 1 ) examine sensitivity Cambridge Color Test ( CCT ) low vision CCT ( LvCCT ) severity retinal disease inherit retinal degeneration ( IRD ) compare color vision status change photoreceptor structure function , 2 ) examine effect eccentric fixation reduction visual acuity color discrimination threshold obtain CCT LvCCT , 3 ) establish normal range CCT LvCCT determine intra-session inter-session variability test . Study Population : Up 89 healthy volunteer 144 IRD participant age 5 old enrol study . The IRD participant participate Aim 1 may participate Aim 3 well , healthy volunteer may elect participate one aim . As , overlap population accrue aim . Design : This study comprise three related project . For Aim 1 , color discrimination threshold ( CCT LvCCT ) assessments retinal structure ( image ) function ( perimetry/microperimetry electroretinogram ) measure 30 healthy volunteer 120 IRD participant vary retinal phenotype visual acuity . IRD participant divide four major category : 1 ) cone &amp; cone-rod dystrophy , 2 ) rod-cone dystrophy , 3 ) inherit maculopathies , 4 ) inherit retinal dysfunction syndrome . The fourth category use IRDs match description category 1-3 ( i.e. , x-linked retinoschisis , congenital stationary night blindness ) . Degree severity retinal dysfunction IRD participant determine relative normal range obtain healthy volunteer . For Aim 2 color discrimination threshold ( CCT LvCCT ) measure one eye 12 healthy volunteer order examine effect eccentric fixation reduce visual acuity color threshold independent retinal pathology . Between one three study visit require aim . Aim 3 comprise two part . For Aim 3a , color threshold collect eye ( intraocular variability ) 35 healthy volunteer age 5 old . For Aim 3B , color discrimination threshold ( CCT LvCCT ) measure twice one session second visit occur within two month initial visit determine intra-session inter-session variability . Variability determine 12 healthy volunteer 24 IRD participant . Outcome Measures : For CCT LvCCT , overall quantitative measure color vision obtain calculation achromatic area . The sensitivity CCT LvCCT examine compare achromatic area IRD participant vary level phenotype severity define measure retinal structure function . Secondary outcome study include : 1 ) evaluation sensitivity CCT LvCCT disease severity , 2 ) evaluation effect decrease visual acuity eccentricity color discrimination nthresholds ( CCT LvCCT ) , 3 ) establishment normal range color discrimination threshold ( CCT LvCCT ) function age , 4 ) determination intra- intersession variability two test .</detailed_description>
