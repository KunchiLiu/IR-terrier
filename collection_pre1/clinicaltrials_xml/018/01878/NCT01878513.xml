	<brief_summary>The aim study examine whether determine treatment strategy base upon Cytochrome P450 2D6 ( CYP2D6 ) genotype improve drug response rate clinical outcome patient psychosis . The investigator predict prospectively test CYP2D6 genotype use information treat psychotic patient risperidone improve clinical outcome . Specifically , CYP2D6 poor metabolizers treat low dose slow titration risperidone well treat usual dose titration approach term rate side effect clinical improvement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Cytochrome P450 Genotyping Clinical Outcomes Patients With Psychosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent large scale clinical trial demonstrate substantial proportion patient psychotic disorder , schizophrenia bipolar disorder , discontinue antipsychotic medication due either lack efficacy intolerable side effect , especially extrapyramidal symptom ( EPS ) . In clinical practice , essentially trial error process decide best antipsychotic drug start switch failed trial little empirical data available guide clinician drug selection . One promising tool , potentially provide valuable information help guide medication management , pharmacogenetic analysis cytochrome P450 enzymes metabolize antipsychotic . CYP450 family liver enzymes responsible metabolize many drug toxin . Genes cod enzymes many polymorphism , produce essentially non-functional enzyme result poor metabolism drug . For example , CYP2D6 70 know mutation . Poor metabolizers may higher plasma concentration particular drug usual dosage , may lead severe side effect potential drug discontinuation . On hand , rapid metabolizers tend low drug concentration body may require higher-than-usual dose achieve clinical efficacy . Until recently , genotyping CYP450 polymorphism expensive time-consuming , therefore clinically unfeasible . However , recent FDA approval commercially available genotyping product ( Roche Diagnostics , AmpliChip ) well great availability CYP450 genotyping platform make possible quickly obtain CYP450 genotype clinical application . The AmpliChip test polymorphisms CYP450 2D6 2C19 , stratifies genotype poor metabolizer , extensive/intermediate metabolizer , ultra-rapid metabolize group . Of particular importance treatment psychotic disorder , schizophrenia bipolar disorder psychotic feature , CYP2D6 critical metabolism risperidone , one widely use atypical antipsychotic agent . Several study assess CYP450 genotype patient able tolerate risperidone versus patient able . The CYP2D6 poor metabolizer phenotype show associated risperidone side effect discontinuation drug . Recent evidence suggest intermediate metabolizers also tend high rate side effect take regular dos risperidone . A major limitation previous study case-control retrospective design . To date , study prospectively examine clinical utility CYP450 polymorphism genotyping psychosis . Therefore , conduct prospective study patient psychosis undergo CYP450 genotyping study entry , antipsychotic drug dosage determine CYP2D6 genotype . In study , conduct randomize double blind trial risperidone treatment psychotic patient admit inpatient unit due acute relapse . We anticipate recruit 264 subject test CYP2D6 polymorphism genotype , base randomly assign either low dose slow titration group treatment usual group . They assess every five day 15 day , follow-ups 4-weeks 6-weeks study entry . It hop study provide prospective data whether pharmacogenetic information CYP450 2D6 polymorphism genotype significant clinical impact patient psychotic disorder .</detailed_description>
