	<brief_summary>Abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAAs ) continue lead cause death old age group . In 60-85 year-old population , AAA represent 14th-leading cause death . Federal funding Medicare allocate early detection use abdominal ultrasound screen program . Despite aggressive screening program concert effort surgeon timely repair , incidence rupture AAA continue increase . Endovascular aneurysm repair ( EVAR ) common type repair since 2006 . Multiple study reflect decrease perioperative morbidity mortality open repair make attractive option patient . EVAR require intensive follow-up standard open surgical repair , however . Secondary intervention common maintain `` seal '' endograft within aorta subsequent exclusion aneurysmal component . The term endoleak specific EVAR , describe primary mean endografts fail . Type I endoleaks occur inadequate graft seal proximally distally , result perigraft flow aneurysm sac pressurization . Type II endoleaks occur branch artery arise aneurysmal aorta back-bleed aneurysm sac due collateral flow . Type III endoleaks occur flow persists segment modular graft . Type IV endoleaks occur flow persists endograft material ( graft porosity ) . Type V endoleaks also call `` endotension '' , occur pressurization sac occur absence demonstrable endoleak . Type I Type III endoleaks concern rupture , although persistent Type II endoleaks also lead aneurysm rupture premature death . The common method EVAR follow-up compute tomographic angiography ( CTA ) . These study allow accurate measurement aneurysm sac diameter volume . They also highly sensitive specific endoleaks . Type II endoleaks treat remain persistent present set aneurysm sac enlargement . Type I III endoleaks immediately treat identify . Type IV endoleaks rarely see current endograft technology .</brief_summary>
