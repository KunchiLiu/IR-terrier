	<brief_summary>Background : - An ongoing study look American Indians kidney problem cause type 2 diabetes . Kidney disease due type 2 diabetes major problem American Indians . We previously find early treatment kidney disease losartan probably beneficial reduce progression disease . Researchers want see benefit continue see several year end treatment study . Objectives : - To study long-term benefit losartan treatment diabetic kidney disease American Indians type 2 diabetes . Eligibility : - Participants American Indian diabetic kidney disease study ( OH95-DK-N037 ) . Design : - Participants physical exam medical history start study . Blood urine sample collect . - Participants set test part study . Those severe kidney problem , kidney failure , basic kidney exam scan . The remain participant full urine collection analysis . They also provide kidney biopsy . - Treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol examine long-term impact treatment angiotensin receptor blocker losartan progression diabetic kidney disease American Indians type 2 diabetes . Data protocol also use guide search candidate biomarkers diabetic end-organ damage serum urine identify mechanism diabetic kidney disease may amenable new treatment strategy . All participant previously enrol 6-year randomized clinical trial Protocol OH95-DK-N037 first-degree relative type 2 diabetes invited participate . Participants protocol undergo annual renal clearance study measure glomerular filtration rate renal plasma flow , unless develop kidney failure . At visit , also conduct test peripheral autonomic nervous system determine frequency , severity , rate progression diabetic neuropathy cohort identify linkages diabetic kidney disease diabetic neuropathy . We also perform kidney biopsy initial visit . In previous research kidney biopsy clinical trial , examine extent structural change occur since last kidney biopsy do end clinical trial . First-degree relative enrol clinical trial , undergo research kidney biopsy part trial , invite undergo second kidney biopsy 5-years follow-up . Tissue biopsies undergo morphometric examination compartment-specific gene expression epigenetic profiling . Participants follow annually death development end-stage renal disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : To eligible participation study , subject must meet following criterion : Previous enrollment protocol OH95DKN037 firstdegree relative enrollee age great equal 18 year type 2 diabetes . Willingness , receive thorough explanation study , participate . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Subjects exclude follow reason : Clinically significant disorder liver [ cirrhosis , portal hypertension , hepatitis , increase bilirubin ( great equal 1.5 mg/dl ) , decrease serum albumin ( &lt; 3.5 gm/l ) ] , cardiovascular disease ( angina pectoris , history myocardial infarction , leave ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 40 % , congestive heart failure New York Heart Association Class I IV ) , cerebrovascular disease , peripheral vascular disease , pulmonary disease ( asthma restrictive obstructive lung disease require therapy ) , renalurinary disorder ( calculus , urinary tract obstruction , glomerulonephritis , chronic infection ) , gastrointestinal disorder ( nausea , vomit , diarrhea anorexia sufficient cause weight loss wasting ) , hematocrit level less equal 30 percent woman less equal 35 percent men . Renovascular malignant hypertension ; uncontrolled hypertension ( systolic blood pressure great equal 160 diastolic great equal 95 mm Hg ) despite treatment three antihypertensive drug ; hypertension treat antihypertensive medicine primary care physician patient refuse adopt blood pressure treatment regimen outline study protocol . Hematuria unknown etiology . Prior entry study , subject hematuria evaluate , etiology establish document , treatment render appropriate . Chronic debilitate disorder without treatment ( e.g. , systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) , cancer , amyloidosis , chronic infection ) would interfere assessment kidney function might reduce chance survival sufficient length time evaluate efficacy treatment . Currently receive drug regimen include : steroid , immunosuppressant , investigational new drug . Pregnancy . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test prior entry prior renal clearance study . Women pregnant offer opportunity participate follow conclusion pregnancy become pregnant study able resume study follow conclusion pregnancy . Hypersensitivity iodine . Bleeding disorder , since kidney biopsy could perform safely individual . Massive obesity body mass index great equal 45 kg/m ( 2 ) . Kidney biopsies difficult present great hazard person massive obesity . Conditions likely interfere inform consent compliance protocol .</criteria>
