	<brief_summary>Background : - Present treatment hepatitis C include use weekly injection two different pill . This treatment associate serious side effect . Drugs take mouth cure HCV infection without serious side effect would great help large number people infected HCV . GS-7977 GS-5885 new medication develop treat hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection . They still research approve Food Drug Administration . They develop treatment hepatitis C single pill take day . Objectives : - To determine whether combination two study drug safely effectively treat HCV infection people HIV infection cirrhosis liver . Eligibility : - Individuals HIV infection liver disease cause infection HCV . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood sample collect . Urine sample collect participant might become pregnant . If participant liver biopsy past 3 year , one require . - Participants take one pill daily 12 week . This pill combination two study drug . - Treatment monitor frequent clinic visit blood test total 60 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study A Combination Pill With GS-7977 GS-5885 Hepatitis C People With HIV</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection major public health problem estimate 180 million people infected worldwide . In US estimate 4.1 million people infected HCV principal cause death liver disease lead indication liver transplantation . Significant advance make approval directly act antiviral ( DAA ) namely protease inhibitor , telaprevir ( TVR ) boceprevir ( BOC ) show significantly improve rate sustain virologic response ( SVR ) . Response rate new combination HIV/HCV also promise , however treatment characterized high rate toxicity . Recently several trial confirm efficacy potent DAA therapy without concomitant IFN treatment HCV monoinfected individual . Given improve response rate achieve combination DAAs fast HCV suppression improve side-effect profile ; need good therapy HIV/HCV co-infected subject , propose study determine safety , tolerability efficacy 12 week treatment fix dose combination GS-7977 GS-5885 HIV/HCV Genotype 1 ( GT-1 ) subject . We hypothesize anti-HCV therapy rely host immune system provide enhance rate SVR among HIV/HCV GT-1 coinfected subject . The finding study aid understand determinant response IFN-free regimen HIV/HCV coinfected individual .</detailed_description>
