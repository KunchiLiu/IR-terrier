	<brief_title>The Effect BIA 2-093 Steady-state Pharmacokinetic Profile Phenytoin Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study plan single-dose , open label phase ( Phase A ) follow multiple-dose , double-blind , randomised , placebo-controlled , two-way crossover phase ( Phase B ) study patient take phenytoin . Phase B consist two 14-day treatment period separate washout period 10 15 day . Subjects continue usual phenytoin scheme receive single dose ESL 1200 mg ( Phase A ) either ESL ( 600 mg Day 1 7 1200 mg Day 8 14 ) match placebo once-daily 14 day period . The study prematurely terminate due impossibility recruiting plan number patient . Only 4 patient admit consider small sample size allow reliable assessment potential interaction ESL phenytoin . Therefore , pharmacokinetic evaluation perform .</detailed_description>
