	<detailed_description>The host immunity generally recognize main factor determine outcome chronic hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection . Previous study show HBV-specific T cell B cell function exhaust chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) patient . Interestingly , impair T B cell function could partially restore antiviral treatment , recovery seem uncompleted even long-term HBV suppression HBeAg seroconversion . Recently , several emerge evidence indicate HBV-specific immune response could nearly recover hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) seroconversion . This phenomenon suggest HBsAg may play key role immune tolerance immune exhaustion . Indeed , recent study find patient HBsAg seroconversion display HBV-specific T B cell response . Thus , amount HBsAg may serve possible mechanism evade host immune response , anti-HBs antibody HBV specific-T cell response provide protective immunity . HBsAg Nobel prize discovery identify HBV 40 year ago ; day HBsAg remain hallmark overt HBV infection . HBsAg synthesis HBV viral life cycle complex , typically occur endoplasmic reticulum . The envelope open reading frame ( ORF ) contain pre-surface 1 ( preS1 ) , pre-surface 2 ( preS2 ) , ORF-S domain envelope protein generate two HBV messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) transcript , subsequent translation result small ( ORF-S ) , medium ( pres2 + ORF-S ) large surface envelope protein ( preS1 + preS2 + ORF-S ) . These also know large ( L ) , medium ( M ) small ( S ) surface protein , respectively . However , HBsAg production far exceed required virion assembly , excess surface envelope proteins secrete non infectious filamentous spherical sub-viral particle , exceed virion variable factor 102-105 accumulate concentration several hundred microgram per milliliter serum . These data suggest sAg mainly derive sub-viral particle , decline serum HBsAg mean reduction covalently close circular DNA ( cccDNA ) transcription mRNA translation HBV replication . Recently , several study suggest new potential role quantitative serum HBsAg prediction virological response antiviral therapy , least pegylated interferon ( Peg-IFN ) treat patient . In natural history chronic HBV infection , HBsAg level differ significantly 4 phase HBV infection decline progressively immune tolerance ( IT ) ( 5 log IU/ml ) low replication ( LC ) ( 3 log IU/ml ) , HBsAg/HBV-DNA ratio significantly high LC compare others patient . These data suggest quantitative HBsAg may promise prognostic marker natural history HBV-infection antiviral therapy . Thus , loss HBsAg development anti-HBs antibody ( HBsAg-seroconversion ) ultimate goal anti-HBV therapy . CHB patient would achieve HBV DNA replication inhibition , glutamic-pyruvic transaminase ( ALT ) normalization hepatitis B e antigen ( HBeAg ) seroconversion treatment antiviral therapy . In addition , antiviral immunity would improve process . However , difficult patient clear HBsAg reach idea terminal . The major reason presence HBsAg HBV-specific immunity impair . For reason , immunotherapy would helpful enhance anti-HBV immunity acquire high HBsAg seroconversion rate . The purpose study investigate whether immunotherapy ie . HBIG+GM-CSF+HBV vaccine improve rate HBsAg seroconversion . This study also focus tolerance safety treatment CHB patient . Participants study randomly assign one two treatment arm : Arm A : Participants receive 48 week nucleoside analog ( NAs ) treatment combine 24-week treatment hepatitis B immune globin ( HBIG ) +granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor ( GM-CSF ) +HBV vaccine . Arm B : Participants receive 48 week NAs treatment combine 24-week treatment saline placebo . All patient treat continuously NAs 48 week combination HBIg+GM-CSF+HBV vaccine treatment saline placebo first 24-week followed-up 24-week . In treatment period ( 24 week ) , treatment HBIg+GM-CSF+HBV vaccine give four time week 0 , 4 , 12 24 . At time treatment , patient hospitalize treated 800 unit HBIG intramuscularly day 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 4 , treat 75 μg GM-CSF subcutaneously day 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 6 , finally inject 20μg HBV vaccine subcutaneously day 6 . This approach allow initial HBIG injection possibly reduce HBsAg , antigen-presenting cell activate GM-CSF treatment , finally HBV vaccine use prim APC induce HBV-specific immune response . In control group , patient receive GM-CSF control time . After treatment initialize , participant ask come clinic week 4 , 12 , 24 , 36 48 . At visit participant receive enough study treatment last next visit . Each visit last 2 3 hour . At visit participant physical exam , answer question medication take feeling , blood drawn safety efficacy HBsAg quantization . Some additional blood also store HBV-specific T cell B cell response . At visit participant ask question medication medical history , pupil dilate , hear test , electrocardiogram ( EKG ) . Some visit require participant arrive fasting . Pregnancy test may also conduct avoid participant able become pregnant pregnancy suspect .</detailed_description>
