	<brief_title>Navigation Pelvic Floor Bladder Exstrophy Using Pre-operative MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Much long-term success classic bladder exstrophy closure depend initial closure . Several study demonstrate key successful initial closure involve deep dissection pelvic floor bladder place posterior inferior position possible . Oftentimes , need repeat closure abdomen require initial surgeon fail properly dissect deep enough child 's pelvic floor . Many surgeon unfamiliar complex anatomy unable verify properly reach true pelvic floor initial surgery . This often lead failed closure , result poor continence rate later life . The investigator attempt determine safety efficacy use Brainlab , Inc. VisionVectorÂ® Cranial Image Guided Surgery System closure bladder exstrophy . The value research two-fold . Firstly , project help u verify investigator indeed dissect proper plane require successful initial closure bladder exstrophy . Secondly , project help others relatively less experience bladder exstrophy properly identify anatomically closure exstrophy , thus yield high success rate well patient care center .</detailed_description>
