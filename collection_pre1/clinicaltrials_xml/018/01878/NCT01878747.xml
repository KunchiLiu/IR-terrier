HCPs also learn intricacy implement strategy way adjust behavior effectively keep child engage cop related behavior . Child 's anxiety m-YPAS induction assess two point , ) enter operating room b ) introduction anesthesia mask child . Once OR , child 's blood pressure heart rate also assess . A total 10 child-parent dyad interaction per HCP collect baseline assessment phase . HCP behavior induction also videotape research assistant cod later use P-CAMPIS measure . Also , parent child answer baseline questionnaire aim capture demographic , anxiety , health belief .
