	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : The skill patient oral anticoagulant critical achieve good outcome treatment . Self-management , capacity patient control INR ( International Normalized Ratio ) level adjust treatment , effective strategy treatment . Capacity patient self manage determine range factor . The identification factor would improve design self management programmes turn increase number patient able self-manage . The objective study identify factor determine ability patient oral anticoagulant therapy achieve self-management treatment . METHOD : This three year quasi- experimental prospective study control group . 333 patient anticoagulant therapy five health centre Basque Health Service follow period six month intervention , assess ability self-test self-manage . The intervention consist patient training programme involve provision information practical training concern condition treatment , well use portable blood coagulation monitoring device adjust anticoagulant dose . DISCUSSION : Training programme self-management effective term enable patient acquire necessary skill , though level success seem depend various patient-related factor . Given proven benefit self-management , would useful properly characterise factor use information successfully increase percentage patient oral anticoagulant able self-manage treatment .</detailed_description>
