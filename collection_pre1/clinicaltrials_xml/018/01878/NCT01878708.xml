	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Oncaspar® + Dexamethasone Patients With Relapsed Refractory T-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , investigator-initiated , single-arm pilot study . Patients relapse refractory ( R/R ) peripheral T-cell lymphoma ( PTCL ) receive Oncaspar® every 3 week maximum 8 course disease progression unacceptable toxicity . They also receive dexamethasone 40mg daily 4 day every cycle . They restaged 2 course ( 6 week ) 8 course ( 24 week ) . Both Oncaspar dexamethasone use together treat ALL ENKTL , another subtype T cell lymphoma . The combination may provide collaborative attack cancer cell ; moreover , dexamethasone could also prevent side effect Oncaspar ; especially allergic reaction . This study test two drug together determine effective treatment T-Cell Lymphoma . Each drug commercially available drug market .</detailed_description>
