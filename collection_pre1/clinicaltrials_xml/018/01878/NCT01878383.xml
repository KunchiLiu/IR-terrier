	<brief_summary>PCR detection HSV DNA shed female genital tract use GeneXpert system ( Cepheid , Sunnyvale CA ) compare traditional ( routine ) PCR ( pregnant nonpregnant woman ) HSV culture ( nonpregnant woman ) . The GeneXpert system perform sample-processing step real-time PCR single integrate cartridge . The standard cartridge inexpensive disposable plastic cartridge filtration ultrasonic lysis capability . It consist chiefly several combine mold plastic component : cartridge body contain eleven fluid reservoirs chamber along attached PCR tube , specialize valve body ultrasonic interface contain sub-micron filter glass lysis bead , rotary valve axial syringe barrel . The operation cartridge simple . The rotary valve contains inlet outlet port . Fluid sample buffer drawn syringe drive inlet port rotary valve dispense chamber within cartridge rotate valve expel fluid outlet port . The fluid either pass filter contain within valve assembly pass directly next chamber without filtration , depend path chosen . The cartridge fluidics subsequent real-time PCR perform within GeneXpert instrument . The GeneXpert contain multiple module ( ICORE unit ) independently program drive syringe/rotary valve , perform four-color real-time PCR . Each cartridge fit inside one module , processing , PCR , analysis step perform automatically . Each ICORE module run analyze independently , batch sample unnecessary .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The GeneXpert HSV PCR test validate HSV viral culture routine quantitative PCR . Validation occur two population : 1 ) nonpregnant woman STI clinic clinically-apparent HSV lesion ( Group 1 , n=300 ) , 2 ) pregnant woman active labor visible evidence HSV infection ( Group 2 , n=12,500 ) . All test sample GeneXpert platform , routine quantitative PCR , viral culture do UAB Central Laboratory . Women group specimen obtain genital lesion ( Group 1 ) vaginal swab ( Group 2 ) . Specimens woman Group 1 evaluate HSV culture , routine HSV PCR , GeneXpert HSV PCR . Approximately half woman Group 2 test routine HSV PCR GeneXpert HSV PCR ; specimens rest woman Group 2 store possible testing future routine HSV PCR GeneXpert HSV PCR . In manner , maximize data compare GeneXpert PCR result routine PCR , maintain flexibility ensure adequate number specimen positive HSV DNA routine PCR . Swabs pregnant woman labor place viral transport medium , frozen -20°C , batch-shipped UAB Central Laboratory analysis GeneXpert instrument routine HSV quantitative PCR . Swabs nonpregnant woman STI clinic place viral transport medium , refrigerate 4°C , ship UAB Central Laboratory real time analysis GeneXpert instrument HSV culture routine quantitative HSV PCR . Specimens first 300 woman enrol Group 2 run individual routine PCRs batch 5 sample per PCR run . In manner , validate level detection batch sample routine PCR acceptable . Once validation occur , specimens approximately half remain Group 2 woman batch real-time routine PCR analysis . If batch run 5 specimen negative , test perform . If batch run 5 specimen positive , specimen separate re-running individual PCRs . All specimen evaluate routine PCR also evaluate GeneXpert PCR ; manner , individual routine PCR result result comparison GeneXpert PCR result . A blood specimen obtain nonpregnant ( Group 1 ) pregnant ( Group 2 ) woman time enrollment , determine shed HSV routine PCR , GeneXpert PCR , culture type-specific serologic test perform . Correlation viral type virologic sample HSV-1 HSV-2 serostatus allow categorization infection ( first-episode primary , first-episode nonprimary , recurrent infection ) . Those woman Group 1 positive HSV culture contact directly result know . Women Group 2 positive HSV PCR result contact routine HSV PCR GeneXpert PCR FDA-cleared test population ; thus , know test performance characteristic ( e.g. , sensitivity , specificity , etc . ) completion trial . All pregnant woman Group 2 receive write material time enrollment educate sign symptom neonatal HSV disease . All postpartum woman contact telephone 60-90 day post-delivery inquiry make determine baby develop neonatal HSV disease . Data incidence neonatal HSV disease among baby deliver woman Group 2 compare incidence data Brown et al.1 In study almost 60,000 woman conduct 20 year period , group researcher report incidence rate neonatal HSV disease 1 3,200 live birth .</detailed_description>
