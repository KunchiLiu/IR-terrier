	<brief_summary>Background : - Researchers want look brain responds painful stimulation . They also want see response different people without chronic pain . To test brain response , use chemical call naloxone . Naloxone use treat overdoses painkilling drug like morphine . It may able block effect pain-relieving cream . Researchers apply pain-relieving cream person lower leg look result sensitivity test either naloxone placebo . This study compare result people chronic pain ( like fibromyalgia ) people without chronic pain . Objectives : - To look brain response pain people without chronic pain . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age fibromyalgia . - Healthy volunteer least 18 year age . Design : - This study involve screen visit two test visit . The test visit week apart . - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . After screen participant administer several questionnaire personality , thought feeling . - At first visit , participant try magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan use next visit . They painkilling cream apply one part low leg normal moisturize cream part lower leg . They heat pulse skin area rate pain . - At second visit , participant test MRI scanner . The heat pulse test repeat infusion either naloxone placebo ... .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Different pain reduce drug work different way reduce pain . Many drug , include morphine codeine , reduce pain bind opiate receptor brain . Another chemical , naloxone , block effect drug . In study , look brain response pain-relieving cream whether naloxone block effect cream . We compare result people chronic pain ( fibromyalgia ) people without chronic pain . Design : The study compare MRI response painful stimulation people fibromyalgia healthy volunteer two condition : 1 ) naloxone , 2 ) placebo . Outcome measure : Pain rating pain-related MRI response compare people fibromyalgia healthy volunteer</detailed_description>
