	<brief_summary>Mass Drug Administration ( MDA ) Mass Screening Selective Treatment ( MST ) might apply strategy eliminate malaria focus transmission stage . Many study either MDA MST do low transmission area demonstrate impact activity reduce malaria transmission . However , high transmission study still limit become reason behind study . A randomized cluster trial MST study use dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine plus primaquine ( DHP + PQ ) conduct village Belu regency , Nusa Tenggara TImur province , Central Indonesia . There three arm study , i.e . ( 1 ) intervention arm mass screen treatment interval 6 week ; ( 2 ) intervention arm mass screen treatment interval 3 month ( 3 ) control arm without mass screening treatment . The intervention arm 6 week interval represent new propose method detection malaria infection , intervention arm 3 month interval represent Ministry Health current policy active case detection Indonesia , third arm serve control Ministry Health 's policy . The study conduct 6 month period evaluate various parameter include malaria incidence proportion anemia monthly cohort school child ( arm1 , 2 3 ) , addition malaria prevalence community ( arm 1 arm 2 ) . All positive subject arm receive supervise treatment . Secondary objective proportion gametocytemia community , proportion malaria antibody various age group , population genetic local parasite , submicroscopic incidence base polymerase chain reaction proportion infective mosquito . Data analysis perform accord method cluster randomize trial evaluation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Site The study conduct Belu regency ( south latitude 90 - 100 ; east longitude 1240- 1260 ) locate Nusa Tenggara Timur province , central part Indonesia . Atambua District Health Office report high endemic malaria area situate southern part regency 2011 . The high Annual Parasite Incidence ( API ) report subdistrict Wewiku ( 72.1 cases/1,000 people ) . Therefore , study focus high case incidence village Wewiku sub-districts . Study design overview demographic census The study design `` randomized cluster trial '' microscopic malaria screen high malaria incidence village level . Two-four village malaria prevalence &gt; 8 % sub-villages malaria prevalence &gt; 10 % school child select study villages sub-villages . Census visit perform target village . All cluster list randomize one study arm use generated randomization software . There 3 study arm , i.e . ( 1 ) 6 week interval MST , ( 2 ) 3 month interval MST ; ( 3 ) control without MST . Each MST cover least 80 % villager . Treatment give malaria-positive individual microscopic examination . The treatment provide base suitable dose body weight recommend Ministry Health , Republic Indonesia ( Table 1 ) . The drug give 3-day dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DHP ) treatment 1-day primaquine ( PQ ) treatment P. falciparum . For patient infected P. vivax P. ovale , PQ give 14 day ; dose DHP equal dose P. falciparum infection . Treatment P.malariae infect subject similar P. falciparum without PQ . For individual arm , drug give health care personnel house assist health care volunteer integrate health post ( Posyandu cadre ) . Ethics Consideration An informed consent collect every head family representative . They 1 week consider whether participate study . Adverse event identify recorded Case Report Form field team collaboration cadres primary health center attendant . These subject give symptomatic treatment village/sub-village level local health center . Relationship adverse event study drug determine Data Safety Monitoring Board ( Prof Rianto Setiabudy , dr Erni Juwita Nelwan dr Hasan Basri ) also decide often data send Jakarta . Specific Adverse Event black urine , gastro intestinal disturbance , blue lip breathless . Serious Adverse event adverse event become serious could endanger life subject , cause prolong hospitalization disability conduct normal life . The Data Safety Monitoring Board record Severe Adverse Event form report Principal Investigator , sponsor , Ethic Committee , Regulatory Data Safety Monitoring Board within 24 hour . Severe Adverse Event subject treat Atambua Hospital recover completely . All expense pay sponsor . Complete Severe Adverse Event report distribute within one month occurrence Severe Adverse Event . Evaluation Malaria incidence Inclusion Criteria Children elementary school ( 6-12 year old ) select cluster despite random allocation . Sample size Sample size calculate base difference malaria incidence intervention arm . Baseline incidence determine positive-malaria child monthly cohort MST1 MST3 arm 1 MST1 MST3 arm 2 . Malaria incidence arm 2 assume remains constant 0.7 new cases/person-year study ( unpublished data ) . The impact intervention arm expect reduce malaria incidence maximum 50 % 0.35 new cases/person-year . With proposed sample size 70 child per arm , power 82 % detect significant difference . Considering 10 % loss follow-up design effect cluster-randomized trial 1.5 , recruit 115 child per arm . All school-age child participate study malaria-positive blood smear receive complete treatment previously mention . The antimalaria drug give direct observation treatment ( DOT ) technique supervision perform school teacher assistance health care volunteer . Blood sample draw prick finger tip school-age child use microscopic examination , Polymerase Chain Reaction assay , hemoglobin measurement , serological examination malaria antibody Glucose-6-Phosphate Dehydrogenase deficiency assessment . Anemia malaria infection Inclusion criterion Elementary school child age 6-12 year participate cohort study . Sample size Sample size calculation perform WinPepi software assume anemia proportion 25 % 50 % arm 1 arm 2 , respectively ( 5 % significance level , 80 % power , 1:1 sample size ratio ) . Required sample size would 58 school-age child per arm . We recruit115 school child consider design effect 1.5 , drop level 10 % sample size malaria incidence Blood sample draw prick finger tip elementary school child use microtainer much 0.25 ml . Simultaneously , thick thin blood smear make microscopic examination malaria hemoglobin level measurement . The collected blood sample tube container deliver laboratory distribution mention assay . Malaria prevalence Inclusion criterion All villager select cluster ( arm 1 : MST1 , 2 , 3 arm 2 : MST1 , MST3 ) , except elementary school child participate cohort study . Cluster chosen locate village endemicity 8 % sub-villages 10 % . Sample size Sample size calculate base difference malaria prevalence treatment arm 1 arm2 . The malaria prevalence use study 15 % , expect decrease 30 % arm 1 persistent arm 2 . Sample size calculation perform WinPepi software assume probability proportion 10 % 15 % arm 1 arm 2 , respectively ( 5 % significance level , 80 % power , 1:1 sample size ratio ) . Required sample size would 686 subject . We recruit 1029 subject consider design effect 1.5 . All villager participate arm malaria-positive blood smear treat completely previously describe .
