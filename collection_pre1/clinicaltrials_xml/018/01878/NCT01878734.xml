	<brief_summary>Addressing micronutrient deficiency Zambia recognize national priority government due major contribution morbidity mortality among child , especially infant formative year . One successful , cost-effective , recommend strategy address micronutrient malnutrition 'in-home fortification ' micronutrient powder ( Sprinkles widely recognize ) along nutrition education . While intervention proven safe , effective , efficacious numerous country , specific national protocol must develop maximize effect reduce anaemia Zambian child . The propose research aim inform protocol .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Zambia Micronutrient Powder Trial Effectiveness Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Purpose While Zambia make progress towards reduce under-nutrition among child , measure underweight , indicator nutritional status , particularly stunt anaemia remain unchanged past decade . Repeated national survey show anaemia remain public health significance among Zambian child . According WHO classification , prevalence anaemia 40 % categorize severe public health problem . There significant reduction anaemia among child 6-59 month past two decade estimate prevalence 60 % 1998 , 53 % 20032 49 % 20093 . Further , young infant find affected old child estimate prevalence 81 % child 6-18 month 1992 61 % child 6-24 month 2009 . In develop country approximately 50 % anaemia attribute iron deficiency . It estimate frequency iron deficiency 2.5 time anaemia , anaemia prevalence exceed 40 % , assume entire population suffer degree iron deficiency . It therefore assume case young child Zambia . It well establish iron deficiency adverse health consequence even anaemia develops . These include cognitive impairment , decrease physical capacity reduce immunity . The promising strategy age group 'home fortification ' staple complementary food ( food consume addition breast milk 6 month age ) small packet Micronutrient Powders ( MNP ) easily mixed home-prepared food . MNP pack single-serve sachet mixed vitamin mineral powder form , instantly sprinkle prepared ready-to-eat complementary food young child without change colour taste food . The sachet pack ensure correct amount micronutrient give . As 'stunting ' , low height age , problem public health significance Zambia 45 % child five stunt , programme specifically address practice help improve nutritional intake reduce infection order promote growth early year life . Therefore purpose project conduct 12 month trial MNP Northern Province Zambia , order inform future scale . 2 . Justification Home fortification MNP prove efficacious effective reduce prevalence iron deficiency anaemia young child . Today , MNP successfully use 45-50 country worldwide . Based large body evidence available , WHO strongly recommend use MNP contain least iron , vitamin A zinc improve iron status reduce anaemia child 6-23 month age prevalence anaemia child two year five year age 20 % high . Previous trial show reduction anaemia 31 % , iron deficiency 51 % young child consume MNP 20-30 % programmatic setting . Furthermore , MNP show effective treat prevent anaemia iron syrup . In 2011 , study Nepal Kenya report significant decrease prevalence stunt follow inclusion MNP program child 6-59 month age . While study demonstrate MNP efficacious effective specific setting , recognize finding one country transferable another due difference acceptability accordance cultural practice , economics , food availability particularly infant child feeding practice . This project design fill need country specific programme regionally relevant training material , packaging , message mother distribution system . Through previous work develop communication material package MNP Zambia follow feasibility study 30-day trial . We evaluate acceptability , utilization compliance MNP modify train material base finding . We prepare conduct 12-month pilot study MNP integrate IYCF two district basis develop evidence-based policy implement MNP scale Zambia . 3 . Objectives MNP Pilot - To demonstrate effectiveness MNP reduce iron deficiency anaemia child 6-23 month 12 month supplementation ; - To evaluate effectiveness integrate MNP IYCF package improve child nutritional status growth ; - To quantify impact integrate MNP IYCF package reduce iron deficiency anaemia improve nutritional status child . - To develop MNP communication strategy Behaviour Change Communication material . - To develop national plan policy recommendation scale-up integration MNP IYCF . 4 . Research Method The 'Home Fortification Programme MNP Young Children Zambia ' design multiphase project first phase consist two component , feasibility study 30-day trial MNP . The finding previously conduct feasibility study 30-day trial integrate design pilot phase , inform best scale MNP intervention Zambia . Methods develop accordance overall pilot programme goal objective , take consideration limitation implement rigorous scientific design resource poor setting access , transportation communication , limited . Ethical consideration allow control group prevalence anaemia presume high efficacy MNP reduce anaemia , establish . The pilot conduct rural community Mbala district Northern Province . The population government 's MNP IYCF intervention child 6-23 month caregiver , live Mbala district , Northern Province . It estimate due logistical constraint , 26 health facility , 9 involve pilot . Therefore target population approximately 2,350 child . The formulation MNP use pilot contain 15 micronutrient include iron , zinc , vitamin A , C , D , B group vitamin , folic acid iodine order control micronutrient deficiency commonly find individual . The formulation take account recommend daily micronutrient requirement child 6-23 month , availability source include on-going nutrition programme upper level individual micronutrient . The MNP formula safely provide child receive bi-annual high dose vitamin A , consume iodized salt . Caregivers child 6-23 month supply box 30 sachet every two month duration one year . This cover 50 % recommend Nutrient Intake iron child age group . The MNP deliver select family primary health care system . An effectiveness study embed within pilot programme assess effect MNP plus IYCF intervention package relation programme 's goal outcomes programmatic condition within target population . There two distinct group invite participate effectiveness component pilot , district Mbala . One serve control group , receive MNP . Both treatment group control group receive IYCF early child development ( ECD ) training , deworming tablet ( Mebendazole ) insecticide-treated net , treatment group additionally receive MNP . Mother-child pair two group closely follow across 12 month intervention period in-depth assessment take place three point time ; baseline , 6 month 12 month intervention begin . The baseline evaluation conduct mother train use MNP part complementary feeding . The tool use assessment described . The primary outcome variable use determination sample size effectiveness component study change prevalence anaemia among participate child ( define haemoglobin &lt; 11.0 g/dL ) course 12-month intervention district Mbala Data collect include anthropometry , form MUAC , waste ( Weight-for-height ) , stunt ( height-for-age ) , weight-for-age . Biochemical data haemoglobin , serum ferritin , serum transferrin receptor measure iron status , C-reactive protein alpha-1 acid glycoprotein use control infection , retinol binding protein measure vitamin A status . There also questionnaires , consist quantitative qualitative question , administer . 6 ) Statistical Analysis Data enter field Excel later transfer SPSS file analysis . At baseline , descriptive characteristic calculate variable key outcome variable compare across group . At midline end-line comparison make across time among three group use mean , standard deviation , proportion relevant . The p-value set 0.05 adjustment make multiple comparison .</detailed_description>
