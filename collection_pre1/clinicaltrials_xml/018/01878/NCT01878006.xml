	<brief_summary>Background : - Small difference gene may alter response drug . One gene different form mu opioid receptor gene . People one form gene sensitive alcohol . People different form sometimes sensitive pain . Morphine prescription pain pill produce pain relief act mu opioid receptor . Researchers want see well drug call remifentanil help determine sensitivity pain . Remifentanil strong short-acting pain medication sometimes use anesthesia surgery . The study test much drug cause pupils constrict . Objectives : - To see remifentanil help determine pain sensitivity . Eligibility : - Individuals 21 55 year age take pain pill prescribe treat pain medical dental procedure . Design : - This study screen phase study phase . The screening phase involve one two visit 5 6 hour . The study phase one outpatient visit take 3 hour . - Participants screen medical psychiatric history physical exam . They ask drink drug-taking history , family history alcoholism drug abuse . Blood , urine , breath sample collect . - During study session , participant test sensitivity place one hand cold water . Pupil diameter measure sensitivity test . - After blood sample take , participant receive remifentanil . The sensitivity test repeat . Final blood sample collect . A brief physical exam also perform . - Participants stay clinic effect drug worn . - About 1 week study session , participant follow-up phone call .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objectives Mesolimbic dopamine ( DA ) release key signal drug reward , endogenous opioids think exert effect part modulate activity system . A functional ( Micro ) -opioid receptor ( OPRM1 ) A118G single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) associate increase risk heroin addiction study . This polymorphism show confer differential pain sensitivity alter release DA follow alcohol challenge . The objective study examine role A118G OPRM1 polymorphism response challenge opiate ( remifentanil ) regard psycho-physiological variable measure laboratory brain dopamine release measure [ 11C ] raclopride PET . Study Population Healthy male participant experience oral prescription analgesic ( e.g. , Oxycontin , Vicodin , Percocet , oxycodone ) recruit study . These volunteer screen obtain sample two group subject : 1 ) person homozygous major 118A allele ( 118AA genotype ) ; 2 ) person carry one two copy variant 118G allele ( 118AG 118GG genotype , hereafter call 118GX ) . We recruit 120 participant obtain 40 completers per genotype study . Design We compare response group challenge morphine give intravenously . Participants receive standardize IV challenge morphine ( 10.0 mg/70 kg 1 minute ; morphine concentration 2 mg/ml ) . Pre post injection measure make two area : 1 ) subjective response measure standardized questionnaire , 2 ) measure physiological response , include pupil response light , respiratory rate , oxygen saturation pain rating put hand cold water blood chemistry . In addition , visit , participant wear AutoSense mobile physiological monitor ; parameter measure AutoSense include respiration rate , heart rate , heart-rate variability , skin conductance , activity level . The injection repeat participant PET scanner , morphine normal saline . Dopamine release assess determine difference bind potential [ 11C ] raclopride , positron emitter label ligand bind preferentially D2 receptor saline administration bind potential morphine administration . Outcome measure We hypothesize 118GX subject significantly different subjective response challenge 118AA subject observe participant receive alcohol similar study ( Ramchandani et al . 2011 ) . However , genotype effect response may opposite effect genotype alcohol response . We also hypothesize PET study [ 11C ] raclopride show 118GX subject less dopamine release morphine administration 118 AA subject .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Male participant 2155 year age . 2 . Good health determine medical history , physical exam , EKG lab test . 3 . Current nonsmoker light smoker ecigarette user ( &lt; 20 cig/week ) easily abstain smoke ecigarette user 12 days/week . 4 . Current nondrinker social drinker ( &lt; 15 drinks/week , &lt; 5 drink occasion within last 6 month ) . 5 . An equal number final participant OPRM1 118 A/A vs. 118A/G 118G/G genotype . This mean first group ( n40 ) complete participant require genotype group include . 6 . Prior opiate use , least one experience one opiates . 7 . Comprehension/fluency English Language . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : &lt; TAB &gt; 1 . Current prior history significant disease , include cardiovascular , respiratory , gastrointestinal , hepatic , renal , endocrine , reproductive disorder , positive hepatitis HIV test screening , disorder could make administration opiate risky ( e.g. , asthma , COPD , sleep apnea , breathe disorder ; liver kidney disease ; thyroid disorder ; trouble swallowing , blockage digestive tract ( stomach intestine ) ; neurologic disorder ( e.g. , history head injury brain tumor , epilepsy seizure disorder , CVA , migraine treatment , etc . ) ; low blood pressure ; hypertension ; neuromuscular disorder ; gallbladder disease ; Addison 's disease adrenal gland disorder , enlarge prostate , urination problem ) 2 . Current AxisI psychiatric illness determine Structured Clinical Interview DSM IV disorder ( SCID ) . 3 . Current prior history alcohol drug dependence . 4 . Positive result urine screen illicit drug . 5 . Medication Use : 1 . Current chronic prescription counter medication use prescription OTC medication know interact dopamine receptor within 2 week study . 2 . Drugs know inhibit induce enzyme metabolize opiate use 4 week prior study . These include chlorzoxazone , isoniazid , metronidazole disulfiram . 3 . Coughandcold preparation contain antihistamine opiate , pain medicine withhold least 72 hour prior study session . 4 . Drugs may interfere BOLD MRI signal within 2 week study . These include , may limit : muscle relaxant respiratory , cardiovascular anticonvulsant medication . 6 . Morbid obesity ( BMI &gt; 40 kg/m ( 2 ) ) 7 . Previous negative effect opioid administration 8 . Presence certain implanted device ( cardiac pacemaker neurostimulator , artificial joint , metal pin , surgical clip implant metal part ) , body morphology , claustrophobia . Justification : Implanted device may increase risk MRI scan and/or adversely affect quality data ; body morphology may prevent optimal position scanner thus affect quality data ; participant claustrophobia may find MRI scan unpleasant may exhibit excess movement adversely affect quality data . Assessment tool ( ) : Prospective participant fill MRI screen questionnaire undergo interview MR technologist . Questions concern suitability scanning refer Medical Advisory Investigator . Prospective participant question symptom claustrophobia place mock scanner first visit ass possible difficulty tolerate confinement scanner ability fit scanner . 9 . Conditions restrict participant ability lie flat two hour ( coagulopathies , superficial deep vein thrombosis , musculoskeletal abnormality ) . Justification : PET scan session require participant lie flat back remain perfectly still approximately two hour . Therefore , condition would make difficult ( e.g . chronic back pain , significant scoliosis ) dangerous ( e.g . familial hypercoagulability syndrome , history thrombosis ) exclusionary . Assessment tool ( ) : History physical examination qualify IRP clinician , supplement trial lie mock scanner ass comfort . 10 . Head injury result unconsciousness &gt; 5 minute 11 . Exposure ionize radiation research study , combination study tracer , would result cumulative exposure &gt; 5 rem within previous 12 month period . 12 . Selfreported and/or observed sign , symptom , diagnosis Raynaud Buerger disease ( e.g. , pain hand foot time rest , during/following cold exposure stress , significant color change hand toe ) . Additionally , medical staff present watch symptom actual cold pressor test .</criteria>
