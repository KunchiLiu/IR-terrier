	<brief_summary>Total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) common surgical procedure among Veterans . It often use treat hip osteoarthritis , common among Veterans general population . Some patient continue experience functional limitation THA , study show patient still tend put great load opposite leg , increase risk develop osteoarthritis leg . One likely reason post-surgical limitation rehabilitation minimal follow procedure . This project involve development preliminary test functional movement retrain program , design help Veterans improve function biomechanics THA . The project also develop process deliver program Veterans ' home , increase accessibility .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rehabilitation follow total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) limit scope , patient continue exhibit functional limitation , well load asymmetry place risk develop osteoarthritis contralateral joint . The purpose study collect preliminary data support large project examine effectiveness 12-session functional movement retraining ( FMR ) program Veterans follow THA . A novel aspect FMR program focus improve overall function also normalize side-to-side asymmetry balance strength via patient-specific tailoring exercise . The program also involve telerehabilitation process improve access . Participants n=15 patient schedule THA Durham VAMC , identify electronic medical record . Participants complete assessment pre-operatively , approximately 6-weeks post-THA , time FMR program begin . The 12 FMR session optimally deliver twice weekly 6 week . However , account missed visit , investigator allow 9 total week complete 12 session . Therefore follow-up assessment schedule 15-weeks post-THA participant . FMR session combination : 1 . ) in-person , on-site visit telephone contact license physical therapist 2 . ) in-home telehealth visit telehealth technologist physical therapy assistant . The FMR program focus improve low extremity mobility , muscle stability functional movement pattern . Participants instruct perform series stretch exercise daily strengthen exercise three time weekly . Exercises patient tailor accord result Lower Quarter Y-Balance Test ( conduct baseline mid-way program ) , assess asymmetry limbs anterior vs. posterior reach . Outcomes include objective functional measure ( time up-and-go , sit-to-stand , walk speed , stair climb , Lower Quarter Y-Balance Test ) , self-reported pain activity limitation ( Hip disability Osteoarthritis Outcome Score ) , therapist-assessed function ( Harris Hip Score ) . Basic descriptive statistic use compare change outcome ( pre-operative 15-week post-THA 6-week post THA 15-week post-THA ) inform sample size estimate large trial . The investigator also assess various aspect program feasibility ( recruitment success , adherence , telerehabilitation process ) collect in-depth qualitative information patient therapists assess aspect intervention may need modify prior large study .</detailed_description>
