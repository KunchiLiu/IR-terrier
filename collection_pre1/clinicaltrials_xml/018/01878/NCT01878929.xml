	<detailed_description>Subcutaneous allergen immunotherapy ( SCIT ) widely use effective treatment modality allergic rhinoconjunctivitis asthma . SCIT start build-up phase patient receive frequent , escalate dos allergens allergic reach predetermine maintenance dose . This follow maintenance phase allergen dose keep constant administer great interval . Maximum clinical improvement generally see patient maintenance phase . Anecdotal evidence possible reaction SCIT administer patient 's pollen season lead dosage freeze patient 's pollen season extend length build-up phase many month . Prolonging buildup phase increase time require obtain maximal benefit SCIT , time , decrease patient compliance therapy due prolonged period time frequent injection require . The aim study determine adverse reaction pollen SCIT increase dos increase pollen season . Specific Aim 1 : To determine escalate pollen SCIT dose pollen season associate increased rate immediate reaction comparison hold SCIT dose constant . Hypothesis : There increase rate immediate reaction SCIT build phase receive pollen season comparison SCIT hold pollen season . Strategy : In prospective trial , 245 subject randomize receive monthly ( dos hold constant ) weekly ( dos build ) injection . Rate immediate local systemic reaction per injection compare two group . Specific Aim 2 : To determine escalate pollen SCIT dose pollen season associate increased rate delay reaction comparison hold SCIT dose constant . Hypothesis : There increase rate delay reaction SCIT build phase receive pollen season comparison SCIT hold pollen season . Strategy : In prospective trial , 245 subject randomize receive monthly ( dos hold constant ) weekly ( dos build ) injection . Rate delay reaction per injection compare two group . BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Immunotherapy one effective therapy allergic rhinoconjunctivitis , protocol dose pollen season base limited data . Immunotherapy give increase dosage build phase order build tolerance . After build phase , maintenance phase use remainder therapy . At time , little data support common practice increase dosage immunotherapy pollen season . The recent allergen immunotherapy practice parameter reference 2 article note increased systemic reaction SCIT pollen season . , In one prospective study , conclude direct correlation reaction SCIT pollen season.3 They note correlation mean monthly mold count August October rate systemic reaction . The study reference prospective study observe statistically significant difference rate systemic reaction grass ragweed pollen respective pollen seasons.4 However , conclusion study conflict another study consist survey retrospectively send member American Academy Allergy Asthma Immunology . The survey study identify 46 % near fatal reaction SCIT occur peak allergy season . Though immunotherapy standard parameter define pollen season contraindication , consider minimal risk study . It still common practice stop buildup phase escalate SCIT dose pollen season due conflict available data limitation study design many study ( retrospective , questionnaire base ) . A look SCIT dosing pollen season allow standardized practice potentially improve patient outcome .</detailed_description>
