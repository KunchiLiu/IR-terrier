	<brief_summary>The purpose present research evaluate effect bioactive glass bone regeneration immediately follow extraction mandibular maxillary premolars.The hypothesis study assume treatment would promote heal extraction socket preserve height width bone . Furthermore , would allow effective tooth movement orthodontic treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioactive Glass ( Sol-gel ) Alveolar Bone Regeneration After Surgical Extraction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bioactive glass long know bone graft substitute capable bone augmentation . The current proposal introduces newly tailor bioactive glass scaffold multi-scale porosity prepare use sol-gel technique regenerate bone extraction socket aim preserve alveolar ridge . This novel material potential enhance angiogenesis osteogenesis thereby preserve overall height width alveolar bone regenerate new bone closely mimics adjacent healthy one . Thirty patient require myofunctional therapy include premolar extraction part two stage orthodontic treatment ( class II division I ) enrol phase I/II clinical study . Patients undergo extraction maxillary mandibular premolar teeth . This serve split-mouth study one side extraction socket leave empty side receive bioactive glass bone graft substitute . Clinical radiographic assessment heal perform following time interval ; 1,2,4,12,24 week . Clinical criterion include score pain , inflammation , occurrence post-operative complication use well-defined scoring system . Radiographic assessment monitor change crestal bone height bone mineral density . Computed tomographic scan also take preoperatively 6 month patient 3D assessment bone change . A core biopsy also take informed consent 6 month time-point evaluate quality quantity new bone form .</detailed_description>
