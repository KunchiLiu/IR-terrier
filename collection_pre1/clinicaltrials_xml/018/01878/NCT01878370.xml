	<brief_summary>In previous study , investigator deliver graphs family physician outline proportion patient history diabetes heart disease achieve evidence-based quality target derive guideline recommendation . A qualitative evaluation find participate family physician act upon feedback two main reason . First , felt target recommend guideline often apply particular patient . Second , complain difficulty use feedback report provide aggregate level data clinical action . In cluster-randomized trial , investigator test two approach conduct audit feedback aim address issue . The investigator hypothesize feedback identify small number patient high-risk cardiovascular event require action effectively lead change clinical behavior feedback identify patient reach optimal care target .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Audit Feedback Primary Care : Cluster-randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For last two year , physician contribute data Electronic Medical Record Administrative data Linked Database ( EMRALD ) receive two feedback report . The first focused diabetes second patient heart disease . The report provide aggregate information regard proportion family physician 's patient meet quality target , patient-specific information . Currently feedback sent physician courier EMRALD team every six month . The intervention arm trial follow : - Arm 1 - Standard , aggregate-level feedback report focus proportion patient hypertension and/or diabetes and/or ischemic heart disease meet target send via courier every six month available password protect website . Family physicians arm also access website patient-level data identify patient achieve optimal quality care target . - Arm 2 - Aggregate-level feedback report focus proportion patient hypertension and/or diabetes and/or ischemic heart disease meeting criterion high-risk send via courier every six month available password protect website . Family physicians arm also access website list chart number identify patient high risk . Both arm opportunity receive continue medical education credit complete worksheet prompt reflect upon data . Family physicians Arm 1 ask complete worksheet follow continuous quality improvement principle , include set aim statement , engagement team member clinic , test change concept first small scale , scale effort spread best practice . Family physicians Arm 2 ask complete worksheet also include goal set action planning , focus reduce number patient high-risk criterion offer suggest practice-based approach .</detailed_description>
