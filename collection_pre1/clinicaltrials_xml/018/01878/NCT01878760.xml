	<brief_summary>The aim APRICOT study : - To establish incidence severe critical event child undergo anesthesia Europe . - To describe difference paediatric anaesthesia practice throughout Europe . - To study potential impact variability occurrence severe critical event ( Laryngospasm , Bronchospasm , Pulmonary aspiration , Drug error , Anaphylaxis , Cardiovascular instability , Neurological damage , Perianaesthetic cardiac arrest postanaesthetic Stridor ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>APRICOT : Anaesthesia PRactice In Children Observational Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite introduction better-structured programme paediatric anaesthesia training development recommendation paediatric anaesthesia service , incidence severe critical event child still unknown Europe . Considering major life-threatening complication follow general regional anaesthesia uncommon , therefore crucial consider large multinational , multicentre trial order establish realistic statistical estimation identify risk factor severe critical event . Thus , prospective observational multicentre cohort study design identify incidence potential risk factor severe critical event child undergo anaesthesia Europe . The study aim include child birth 15 year old schedule elective urgent diagnostic surgical procedure sedation general anaesthesia without regional analgesia regional anaesthesia . This represent denominator dataset calculation incidence severe critical event , primary aim study . The anaesthesiologist charge record occurrence select severe critical event 60 minute anaesthesia sedation AND require immediate intervention . These severe critical incident include : Laryngospasm , Bronchospasm , Pulmonary aspiration , Drug error , Anaphylaxis , Cardiovascular instability , Neurological damage , Perianaesthetic cardiac arrest postanaesthetic Stridor . The secondary endpoint represent risk factor consequence occurrence severe critical event include in-hospital mortality establish 30 day discharge . Relevant aspects child 's medical family history record . Following sample size estimation , plan recruit least 25 000 child period two consecutive week include weekend after-hours across 30 European country represent European Society Anaesthesiology Council part geographical Europe . The 2-week recruitment period choose site commence 15 March 2014.The last possible inclusion date decide Study Steering Committee depend recruitment rate . Participating hospital provide data acquisition sheet enable anonymous standardized record patient ' parameter , use local institution fill electronic case report form ( eCRF ) . Descriptive statistical analysis perform primary endpoint ( occurrence severe critical event 95 % confidence interval ) . Univariate multivariate analysis perform test factor associate endpoint . Results logistic regression report adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) 95 % confidence interval .</detailed_description>
