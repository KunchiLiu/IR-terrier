	<criteria>Subjects , opinion investigator , comply requirement protocol . A male female 18 year age old time first vaccination . Written inform consent obtain subject . Healthy subject subject wellcontrolled chronic disease , establish medical history clinical examination enter study . Female subject nonchildbearing potential may enrol study . Nonchildbearing potential define premenarche , current tubal ligation , hysterectomy , ovariectomy postmenopause . Female subject childbearing potential may enrol study , subject : practiced adequate contraception 30 day prior vaccination , negative pregnancy test day vaccination , agree continue adequate contraception entire treatment period 2 month completion vaccination dose . Use investigational nonregistered product ( drug vaccine ) study vaccine 30 day precede dose study vaccine , plan use study period . Chronic administration ( defined 14 day total ) immunosuppressant immunemodifying drug within six month prior vaccine dose . For corticosteroid , mean prednisone ≥ 20 mg/day , equivalent . Inhaled topical steroid allow . Any administration longacting immunemodifying drug ( e.g . rituximab , infliximab etc . ) within 6 month study start , plan administration study period . Administration influenza vaccine within 6 month precede study start plan use vaccine study period . Administration vaccine ( ) within 30 day prior study enrollment study period . Clinically virologically confirm influenza infection within 6 month precede study vaccination . Any confirm suspected immunosuppressive immunodeficient condition , base medical history physical examination ( laboratory testing require ) : History human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection , Cancer treatment cancer , within 3 year study enrollment . Persons history cancer diseasefree without treatment 3 year eligible . Acute disease and/or fever time enrollment . Acute disease define presence short term , moderate severe illness , without fever . Fever define temperature ≥ 38.0°C/100.4°F oral , axillary tympanic route . The preferred route record temperature study oral . Subjects minor illness ( mild diarrhea , mild upper respiratory infection ) without fever may , enrol discretion investigator . Significant acute chronic , uncontrolled medical psychiatric neurological illness . `` Uncontrolled '' define : Requiring institution new medical surgical treatment within one month prior study enrollment , Requiring reinstitution previously discontinue medication medical treatment within one month prior study enrollment , Requiring change medication dosage one month prior study enrollment due uncontrolled symptom drug toxicity ( elective dosage adjustment stable subject acceptable ) , Hospitalization event fulfil definition SAE within one month prior study enrollment . Acute chronic , clinically significant pulmonary , cardiovascular , hepatic renal functional abnormality , determine physical examination laboratory screen test . Subjects participate registration trial [ 116664 ( FLU QTIV014 ) ] Fluviral™ 2012/2013 conduct 20122013 season . Presence blood dyscrasia , include hemoglobinopathy myelo lymphoproliferative disorder . A history demyelinate disease include Multiple Sclerosis GuillainBarré syndrome . Administration immunoglobulins and/or blood product within 3 month precede dose study vaccine plan administration study period . Any known suspected allergy constituent Fluviral™ and/or history anaphylactic type reaction consumption egg , and/or reaction product contain mercury . A history severe adverse reaction previous influenza vaccination . Pregnant lactate female . History chronic alcohol consumption and/or drug abuse deem investigator render potential subject unable/unlikely provide accurate safety report . Any condition , opinion investigator , prevents subject participation study would make intramuscular injection unsafe .</criteria>
