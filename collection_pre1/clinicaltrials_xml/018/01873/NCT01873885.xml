	<brief_summary>This study exploratory Phase 1 randomize , double-blind ( Investigator study subject 2-D echo endpoint assessor ) , placebo-controlled single IV infusion dose escalation study enroll approximately 32 subject stage 1 2 essential hypertension .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1 , Randomized , Double-Blind , Placebo-Controlled Exploratory Study That Will Assess Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics Hemodynamic Response Single 30 Minute Intravenous Infusion Vasomera™ ( PB1046 ) Adult Subjects With Stage 1 2 Essential Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct two part . Part 1 : For initial evaluation safety , pharmacokinetic exposure pharmacodynamic response , subject taper antihypertensive background therapy.The initial start dose sub-therapeutic dose . Dose escalation continue maximum double previous dose either 1 ) maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) identify 2 ) modeling pharmacokinetic ( PK ) data indicate maximum exposure ( Cmax ) next plan dose level would exceed maximum drug concentration ( Cmax ) maximum observed drug concentration follow single subcutaneous administration Study PB1046-PT-CL-0001 . Part 2 : The dose group capable provide Cmax exposure capable elicit clinically relevant hemodynamic response , expand enroll additional 12 subject ( 6 active 6 placebo ) .</detailed_description>

Male female subject childbearing potential must willing able practice effective contraception study , willing able continue contraception 1 month ( 30 day ) last dose study drug . BMI ≥ 20 ≤ 40 kg/m2 Diagnosed essential hypertension currently take one antihypertensive medication control blood pressure , opinion investigator , could safely withdraw antihypertensive therapy . Known allergy study drug component , previously receive Vasomera ( PB1046 ) . Inadequate `` image window '' echocardiography determine screen echocardiography ( core assessment ) , cardiac abnormality may confound echocardiography reading ( i.e. , mitral regurgitation , `` floppyvalve '' syndrome ) evaluation secondary study endpoint . Seated systolic blood pressure &lt; 120 mmHg diastolic blood pressure &lt; 80 mmHg ( confirmed triplicate ) randomization ( Day 1 ) prior first dose study drug ( V3 Day 0 ) exclude subject participation . Evidence sustain elevation systolic blood pressure &gt; 169 mmHg diastolic blood pressure &gt; 109 mmHg prior dose ( Day 0 ) washout period opinion investigator would place subject risk continue study participation ( i.e. , safely withdrawn antihypertensive therapy ) . Clinically significant change health status concomitant prescription medication within 2 week prior dose ( V3 Day 0 ) could place subject risk dose study drug confound primary secondary outcome measure assess Investigator . Unstable/underlying cardiovascular disease define : a. Congestive heart failure ( NYHA class IIIIV ) , stroke , transient ischemic attack , unstable angina pectoris , myocardial infarction within 6 month prior screen ( V1 ) b . Mean triplicate 12lead ECG demonstrate QT interval ( correct use Fridericia 's formula ( QTcF ) ) &gt; 450 msec male &gt; 470 msec female Screening , ( V1 ) history evidence long QT syndrome . c. Sustained heart rate &gt; 100 beat per minute ( BPM ) ( rest ) screening ( V1 ) , prior randomization ( V3 Day 1 ) , prior dosing ( V3 Day 0 ) . d. Any episode atrial fibrillation , ventricular tachycardia ( define ten ( 10 ) beat heart rate great 130 beat per minute ) , ventricular fibrillation , fire implantable cardiac defibrillator ( ICD ) document ventricular ectopy , clinically significant document arrhythmia within 3 month prior administration study drug ( V3 Day 0 ) . Uncontrolled diabetes define Hemoglobin A1c &gt; 10.0 % . Note : applicable subject know suspected history diabetes . Clinically significant renal and/or hepatic dysfunction Screening ( V1 ) baseline ( V3 Day 1 ) . Pregnant lactating female . Known history active drug alcohol abuse within 12 month prior screen ( V1 ) and/or positive drug screen ( illicit drug ) detection alcohol baseline . Positive Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) antibody , hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) antibody . Participation study receive investigational drug device within 30 day prior Screening visit take part nondrug study opinion Investigator would interfere outcome study . Major surgery , donate lose &gt; = 1 unit blood ( approximately 500 mL ) within 30 day prior Screening ( V1 ) display evidence volume depletion ( i.e. , postural hypotension ) prior randomization ( V3 Day 1 ) dosing ( V3 Day 0 ) . Other medical psychiatric condition opinion Investigator would place subject increase risk , would preclude obtain voluntary consent , would confound result study .</criteria>
