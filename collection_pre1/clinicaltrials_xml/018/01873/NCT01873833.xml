	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well capecitabine , cyclophosphamide , lapatinib ditosylate , trastuzumab work treat patient human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -positive metastatic breast cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , capecitabine cyclophosphamide , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving capecitabine cyclophosphamide daily may kill tumor cell . Lapatinib ditosylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzyme need growth . Monoclonal antibody , trastuzumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Giving capecitabine , cyclophosphamide , lapatinib ditosylate , trastuzumab together may effective treatment breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Capecitabine , Cyclophosphamide , Lapatinib Ditosylate , Trastuzumab Treating Patients With HER2-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate progression free survival ( PFS ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate overall response rate ( ORR ) . II . To evaluate clinical benefit rate ( CBR ; complete response , partial response , stable disease &gt; = 24 week ) . III . To estimate overall survival ( OS ) . IV . To assess safety tolerability . OUTLINE : Patients receive capecitabine orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) , cyclophosphamide PO QD , lapatinib ditosylate PO QD day 1-21 trastuzumab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
