	<brief_title>HD-Idarubicin/Etoposide Intensified Conditioning Regimen Allo-HSCT Adult ALL</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It 's well-known long-term outcome adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( ALL ) lag far behind pediatric ALL , associate different molecular cytogenetics make-up treatment strategy . In search optimal regimen pediatric ALL , comprehensive series clinical trial intensive chemotherapy conduct lead 80 % -90 % long-term survival . At time , pediatric-inspired chemotherapy protocol aslo yield charm result 50-60 % 3-year EFS adolescent young adult . In comparison leading role intensive chemotherapy pediatric ALL , allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( allo-HSCT ) play important role treatment strategy adult ALL . According state-of-art understanding ALL , total therapy ALL consist molecular-cytogenetics classification diagnosis , minimal residual disease ( MRD ) monitoring redefine risk classification treatment , pediatric-inspired chemotherapy high-dose Methotrexate/L-asparaginase consolidation therapy , furthermore , risk/MRD-adapted allo-HSCT high-risk refractory/relapsed ALL.In pre-pediatric-inspired protocol era , allo-HSCT still represent major role improve outcome adult ALL , especially high-risk refractory/relapsed ALL . It 's establish graft-versus-leukemia ( GVL ) effect weak ALL patient show poor response donor-lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) . Intensified condition regimen allo-HSCT base hypothesis intensify condition less-used drug could overcome resistance , reduce tumor burden , importantly , spare enough time slow-growing GVL effect follow immune reconstitution finally get rid MRD control disease . Our previous trial HDE-ALL-2011 ( NCT01457040 ) confirm role intensified condition allo-HSCT adult ALL , result significantly improve OS EFS comparison previous standard TBI/CY2 conditioning regimen ( data yet publish ) . But time , FA-TBI/CY2-VP16 condition regimen associate high transplantation-related mortality ( TRM ) , might attribute excessive suppression bone marrow immune . TT-ALL-HIE-2013 , substitute FA idarubicin , aim maintain anti-tumor effect less cross-resistance immune suppression reduce TRM .</detailed_description>
