	<detailed_description>Cancer relate fatigue ( CRF ) - persistent sense exhaustion relate cancer cancer treatment - severely interfere activity daily live , even report factor patient request hasten death . CRF represent serious clinical problem year treatment end . In research cancer survivors 1 3 year completion hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) , 40 % interview report CRF major obstacle resumption usual activity . Despite impact quality life , CRF under-reported , under-diagnosed , under-treated . A variety pharmacologic agent study treat CRF , insufficient evidence recommend use . The promising non-pharmacologic intervention -- exercise cognitive-behavior therapy ( CBT ) -- show equally modest effect . The propose study focus promise new intervention CRF , use systematic light exposure ( SLE ) , consist daily 30-minute exposure much 10,000 lux light commercially available light box . Study collaborator , Ancoli-Israel colleague successfully pilot line research breast cancer patient undergo chemotherapy . The goal study assess effect SLE long-term HSCT breast cancer survivor , determine feasibility acceptability SLE intervention CRF . The approach inform procedure Ancoli-Israel colleague develop research SLE treatment breast cancer chemotherapy , well Redd 's study CBT treat adjustment disorder survivor HSCT . The study arm test efficacy two different type light treatment , bright white light dim red light . Outcomes assessed standardized measure CRF , sleep quality , quality life .</detailed_description>
