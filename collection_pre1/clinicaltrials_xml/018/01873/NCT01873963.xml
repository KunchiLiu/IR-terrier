	<brief_summary>Cardiomyopathy child serious disease result death , disability , heart transplantation serious heart rhythm disorder . Doctors know little cause cardiomyopathy would like learn . In fact , 50-75 % case child know cause . For reason , purpose study identify gene cause cardiomyopathy influence people cardiomyopathy time . These finding could improve disease prevention , surveillance , early management , prognosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pediatric cardiomyopathy heterogeneous genetic disease high morbidity mortality child often present fulminant disease lead death transplant . The long-term goal project identify genetic basis cardiomyopathy correlate finding clinical phenotype risk stratification . These finding could improve disease prevention , surveillance , early management , prognosis . The specific aim study : 1 . To identify disease-causing disease-associated genetic variant underlie pediatric cardiomyopathy carefully phenotyped cohort . 2 . To identify genotype-phenotype correlation allow risk stratification improve management therapy . Exome sequence use part tiered genetic analysis large cohort 700 pediatric cardiomyopathy subject systolic ( dilate cardiomyopathy ) diastolic ( hypertrophic restrictive cardiomyopathy ) dysfunction . The biological parent ( ) enrol participant also approach participate provide blood sample genetic testing . In addition parent ( ) , participant siblings relative may also approach regard enrollment , base pedigree family history . This study significantly increase understand pediatric cardiomyopathy define prevalence mutation gene know cause cardiomyopathy well identify novel disease-causing gene pediatric population . Genetic association test identify variant modify disease . Novel bioinformatics system biology application interpretation exome level genetic information contribute fundamental knowledge technical innovation translation genomic data clinical utility . These aim provide critical genetic architecture data , identify variant large effect , enable genotype-phenotype correlation necessary advance management therapy . The Study two component : 1 ) clinical data collection chart review family interview , 2 ) biospecimen collection genetic testing .</detailed_description>
