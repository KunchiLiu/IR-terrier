	<brief_summary>This prospective , Phase 1-2 , single center study total 100 subject Neuroendocrine Tumors ( NETs ) . Study participant receive one-time administration 68Ga-DOTATATE undergo PET/CT imaging study , investigate suitability PET image agent NETs .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigation 68Ga-DOTATATE , PET Imaging Agent Neuroendocrine Tumor Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , propose use well-established PET isotope , 68-Gallium ( 68Ga ) , bind somatostatin analogue , DOTA-octreotate , DOTATATE , high affinity somatostatin receptor type 2 ( SSTR2 ) . Most gastro-entero-pancreatic ( GEP ) NETs express SSTR2 cell surface ; radiolabeled SSTR2 analogue bind receptor , radioactive molecule internalize transported tumor cell nucleus , thus concentrate radioactivity improve signal-to-noise ratio PET scan , particularly background rapidly clear . This internalization , combine improved physical principle PET imaging , short half-life 68Ga ( 68 minute vs. three day 111In ) , improve radiation dosimetry , faster scanning , low cost result greatly improved scan diagnosis , stag restaging NET disease compare conventional 111In-octreotide imaging . Additionally , 68Ga-DOTATATE PET/CT scanning perform 1.5 hour injection radiopharmaceutical completion scan , vs. 2-3 day 111In-octreotide imaging .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Known diagnosis NET , suspect SSTR positive tumor suspect NET recurrence . At least 18 year age . Patient patient 's legally acceptable representative cognitively provide write informed consent . Able provide inform consent . Females childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test screening/baseline . Use investigational product device within 30 day prior dose , know requirement investigational agent prior completion schedule study assessment . Patients body weight 400 pound able enter bore PET/CT scanner due BMI , compromise image quality CT , PET/CT MRI result . Inability lie still entire imaging time . Inability complete need investigational standardofcare image examination due reason ( severe claustrophobia , radiation phobia , etc . ) Recognized concurrent active infection . Any additional medical condition , serious intercurrent illness , extenuate circumstance , opinion Investigator , may significantly interfere study compliance .</criteria>
