	<brief_title>Bortezomib Late Antibody-mediated Kidney Transplant Rejection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Recent study underscore dominant role alloimmune injury lead cause long-term graft loss kidney transplantation . In respect , formation antibody specific polymorphic donor antigen , commonly human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) , turn important trigger graft rejection ( Colvin , RB et al . 2007 ) . Humoral rejection ( antibody-mediated rejection ; AMR ) organ transplant establish constitute separate rejection entity recent year accurate biopsy-based ( C4d ) serological criterion rejection type define provide valuable basis target treatment ( Sis , B et al . 2010 ) . It become evident considerable proportion recipient develop feature AMR late transplantation , process culminate chronic irreversible tissue damage , graft dysfunction loss ( Mauiyyedi , S et al . 2001 ) . Indeed , study suggest newly form donor-specific antibody ( DSA ) represent primary cause late graft loss ( Einecke , G et al . 2009 ) . In contrast early acute AMR , various treatment protocol include immunoadsorption , intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) CD20 antibody ( Rituximab ) exist , appropriate target treatment late AMR still remain establish ( Vo , A et al . 2008 ) . In early uncontrolled study 11 kidney transplant recipient advance C4d-positive chronic AMR find conversion Cyclosporine A Azathioprine-based basal immunosuppression Tacrolimus Mycophenolate-Mofetil ( MMF ) impact DSA level graft performance ( Schwarz , C et al . 2006 ) . Our observation , contrast previous small study ( Theruvath , TP et al . 2001 ) , suggest simple conversion strategy may suffice ameliorate ongoing late AMR . Rationale More recently , report treatment Bortezomib , proteasome inhibitor , patient diagnose advanced chronic active C4d-positive AMR ( Schwaiger , E et al . 2011 ) . In patient , single cycle Bortezomib lead impressive decrease DSA level complete disappearance capillary C4d deposit follow-up biopsy . Also remarkable observation stable decrease proteinuria . As expect , advance chronic lesion ( severe transplant glomerulopathy ) patient remain unchanged . Nevertheless , 16 month treatment , kidney function stabilize protein/creatinine ratio still half initial value 4,000 mg/g . Objective The primary objective investigator-driven , randomize prospective double-blind , placebo- control trial ass efficiency innovative concept proteasome inhibition Bortezomib treatment late AMR . Our primary hypothesis , inhibit DSA production plasma cell , Bortezomib halt progression ongoing graft injury dysfunction . Study Design The study ( anticipate duration time 36 month ) perform two major step , Part A B . Part A : This part consist cross-sectional screen analysis large cohort approximately 1000 kidney transplant recipient outpatient clinic presence late AMR . Part A : Objective We screen kidney transplant recipient presence circulate DSA biopsy feature late AMR . Key inclusion criterion function graft &gt; 6 month post-transplantation eGFR 20 ml/min/1.73m2 . The GFR threshold choose avoid inclusion transplant show high degree irreversible chronic damage . For patient advanced graft injury sustainable treatment benefit longer expect . Part A : Sample size consideration Approximately 90 % 1000 recipient available pre-screening eligible HLA antibody test . In least 10 % ( n≥90 ) test patient DSA detection expect ( Lachmann , N et al . 2009 ) . We estimate biopsy-based late AMR feature least 60 % DSA-positive patient ( Hidalgo , LG et al . 2009 ) . Hence , least 50 patient eligible inclusion Part B , randomize control trial . Part A : Methodology Estimation GFR eGFR calculate use Mayo equation . For kidney transplant , equation report superior respect estimation GFR slope ( Rule , AD et al . 2004 ) . DSA screening : Serum obtain context routine outpatient laboratory control ( 10 ml blood ; additional venipuncture ) pre-screened anti-HLA immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) alloantibodies use LabScreenMixed assay ( One Lambda , Canoga Park , CA , USA ) . For identification HLA antigen/allele specificity , pre-screen-positive sample subject single-antigen flow-bead ( SAFB ) testing ( LABscreen Single Antigen assay , One Lambda ) . SAFB result document mean fluorescence intensity ( MFI ) , MFI level &gt; 500 consider positive . Donor-specificity define accord donor recipient HLA typing result . Virtual panel-reactive antibody ( PRA ) level calculate use specific software tool ( http : //www.eurotransplant.eu ) . Renal biopsy : All biopsy perform local anesthesia ( lidocaine ) use ultrasound-guided percutaneous technique ( two core per biopsy ) . After biopsy , patient monitor closely least 6 hour complication . Biopsies evaluate standard paraffin-embedded section electron microscopy . ( ) Histomorphological , ( ii ) electron-microscopical ( iii ) immunohistochemical criterion apply assess score late AMR . Part B : This phase IIa , proof concept , randomize prospective , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial . It examine whether treatment Bortezomib capable halt progression late AMR . We plan include 44 patient trial . Part B : Objective To evaluate efficiency safety Bortezomib allograft outcome recipient late AMR . Part B : Randomization 44 patient centrally randomize computer assignment two study arm ( Bortezomib versus Placebo ) use 1:1 randomization scheme . To avoid bias unbalanced baseline variable potentially affect treatment response , stratification perform eGFR ( &gt; versus &lt; 50 ml/min/1.73 m2 ) presence absence Banff I T-cell-mediated rejection ( index biopsy ) . For patient study ID assign . The participate investigator patient blind group allocation completion study . Part B : Intervention Treatment Bortezomib Placebo . Patients allocated intervention group receive two cycle Bortezomib interval 3 month . Each cycle consist Bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 administer twice weekly day 1 , 4 day 8 , 11 . Bortezomib give injection intravenously ( within 3-5 second ) . Bortezomib-treated patient receive oral antiviral prophylaxis prevent development herpes zoster infection : Valacyclovir 500 mg per day ( eGFR &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73 m2 : 250 mg per day ) 3 week initiation cycle . Patients allocate control group receive oral Placebo instead Valacyclovir prophylaxis . According center standard , upon diagnosis late AMR , recipient ( study group ) therapy calcineurin inhibitor ( Tacrolimus Cyclosporine A ) mammalian Target Rapamycin ( mTOR ) inhibitor ( Everolimus Sirolimus ) , without Azathioprine MMF , receive MMF ( initially 2 x 500 mg per day ; absence gastrointestinal side effect significant leukopenia thrombocytopenia stepwise increase dose 2 x 1000 mg per day ) avoid underimmunosuppression . Recipients wean steroid receive low dose Prednisolone ( initiation 10 mg/day , taper 5 mg/day within 4 week ) . Part B : Sample size calculation , power calculation , statistical methodology interim analysis Pilot study use data OEDTR ( OEsterreichische Dialysis Transplant Registry ) conduct estimate eGFR decline variance sequential eGFR determination . When use one eGFR determination two year primary endpoint , analyse show impracticable high sample size number assumption median treatment effect Bortezomib ( 0.5 SD ) . Therefore , difference slope half yearly determine eGFR two treatment group use quantitative outcome measure . Mixed linear model longitudinal data use analysis . Power calculation use autoregressive covariance matrix first order use correlation 0.9 , alpha 0.05 interaction term treatment time attrition 8 % per year show 2 x 22 subject would require uncover difference GFR slop 5ml/min/year power 80 % . To provide solid background power analysis , re-analyzed large retrospective transplant cohort ( transplantation follow-up Medical University Vienna . Evaluating impact late ( &gt; 6 month ) ( C4d-positive ) AMR clinical performance kidney allograft GFR slope -8.2 ml/year ( follow-up 6 year ) , compare slope -1.8 ml/min/year non-biopsied -2.8 ml/min patient biopsied C4d-negative subject observe . All analysis conduct accord intention-to-treat principle . Continuous data analyze t-test , categorical data chi-square test Fisher 's exact test appropriate . The analysis creatinine trajectory stratify treatment ( eventually baseline GFR T-cell-mediated rejection ) perform mixed linear model time therapy independent parameter . The applicable covariance matrix determine graphical analysis evaluate log likely hood ratio . This study monitor independent data safety monitor board ( DSMB ) Medical University Vienna ( MUW ) . Interim analysis perform DSMB completion 10 20 case treatment group . The Lan &amp; DeMets extension O'Brian-Fleming stopping rule apply ( DeMets , LD et al . 1994 ) . The trial stop observed p-value &lt; 0.00001 ( first interim analysis 10 patient ) &lt; 0.00305 ( second interim analysis 20 patient ) . Part B : Adverse event ( AEs ) The probable AEs cause Bortezomib ( usually transient ) mild moderate thrombopenia leukopenia , decrease appetite , gastrointestinal side effect ( vomit , nausea , diarrhea ) , fatigue , peripheral neuropathy neurological symptom headache , dizziness , tremor hypotension . Intensified immunosuppression may associate increase risk infection ( common : herpes zoster , herpes simplex , pneumonia , bronchitis , sinusitis , nasopharyngitis ) . Hence , careful patient follow-up include close monitoring infectious complication ( bacterial , viral fungal infection ) . Valacyclovir adapt kidney function add prevent occurrence herpes virus infection ( herpes zoster ) . The probable AEs cause Valacyclovir headache , nausea , gastrointestinal side effect ( vomit , diarrhea , abdominal pain ) , dizziness , hallucination , confusion , change blood cell count ( Leukocytopenia , thrombocytopenia , anemia ) , increase liver kidney parameter fever .</detailed_description>
