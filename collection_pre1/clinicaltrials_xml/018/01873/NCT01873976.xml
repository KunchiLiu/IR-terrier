	<brief_summary>Cardiomyopathy disease heart muscle . It rare , serious . Cardiomyopathy child result death , disability , heart transplantation serious heart rhythm disorder . Natural substance blood call cardiac biomarkers measure laboratory could less invasive way ( compare echocardiograms MRIs ) detect heart dysfunction child cardiomyopathy . Little known useful valid cardiac biomarkers diagnosis determination symptom child cardiomyopathy . The long-term goal project study helpful measure cardiac biomarkers child cardiomyopathy doctor manage care patient well improve overall health . Measures cardiac biomarkers could help doctor determine best care child cardiomyopathy , include consider heart transplantation treatment option .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pediatric cardiomyopathy heterogeneous disease high morbidity mortality child often present fulminant disease lead death transplant . Highly sensitive specific cardiac biomarkers panel biomarkers , represent different pathologic mechanism pathway , least invasive ( particularly important consideration child ) most-cost-effective approach early detection cardiac dysfunction . The long-term goal project identify biomarkers child cardiomyopathy . These finding could represent major advance determine appropriate evidence-based clinical care child , include consider heart transplantation . The specific aim study : 1 . To determine ability establish novel cardiac biomarkers predict short- long-term outcome child newly diagnose ( incident ) dilate cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) 2 . To assess clinical utility cardiac biomarkers collagen metabolism determine presence myocardial fibrosis , establish cardiac MRI ( cMRI ) , leave ventricular ( LV ) diastolic dysfunction , establish echocardiography newly diagnose exist case idiopathic familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) child . 3 . To determine whether longitudinal change cardiac biomarkers associate worsen heart failure ( HF ) class clinically stable child dilate hypertrophic cardiomyopathy . This study determine importance serological biomarkers , conjunction cardiac imaging , early identification heart disease cardiac remodel functional impairment become irreversible pediatric population . This 5-year prospective study 480 child either primary dilate hypertrophic cardiomyopathy . The study three component : 1 ) clinical data collection chart review , 2 ) biospecimen collection testing , 3 ) centralize review measurement echocardiograms cMRIs .</detailed_description>
