	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive lung disease ( COPD ) characterize airflow obstruction progressive many year largely irreversible . Advanced COPD associate arterial oxygen desaturation lead series complication , ultimately , decrease survival . Long-term oxygen therapy improve clinical outcome patient , exact target oxygen saturation actually translate improvement know . The basis work proposal focus new approach measure oxygen desaturation link daily activity . Accelerometers used measure daily activity synchronize ambulatory oximetry establish activity/oxygen-saturation profile individual patient . The three main objective study 1 ) determine feasibility AOM measurement temporal profile oxygen saturation patient chronic lung disease ; 2 ) determine serial AOM-derived data reliable reproducible ; 3 ) determine threshold oxygen desaturation associate different activity profile</brief_summary>
