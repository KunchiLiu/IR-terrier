	<brief_summary>Type 1 diabetes ( T1D ) one common chronic childhood disease require lifelong insulin therapy . Children adolescents T1D need regular insulin injection continuous insulin delivery use insulin pump order keep blood glucose level normal . We know keep blood sugar normal range help prevent long-term diabetes-related complication involve eye , kidney heart . However , achieve treatment goal difficult particularly due risk low glucose level ( hypoglycaemia ) . One solution use system amount insulin inject closely matches blood sugar level continuous basis . This achieve know `` closed-loop system '' small glucose sensor place skin communicates computer contain algorithm drive subcutaneous insulin pump . We test system Cambridge last five year child find system effective , superior usual insulin pump therapy , maintain tight glucose control . More recently system test overnight , home setting , three week adolescents pilot single-centre study . The next step evaluate use close loop system day night period 7 day ( phase 1 ) 21 day ( phase 2 ) adolescent type 1 diabetes . In present study planning study 24 ( 12 phase 1 an 12 phase 2 ) young people age 10-18 year insulin pump therapy . This study involve two 7 ( phase 1 ) 21 ( phase 2 ) day home study period , glucose level control either automate closed-loop system subject usual insulin pump therapy combine continuous glucose monitor alone random order . Prior closed-loop study period , train period clinical research facility , allow participant familiarise closed-loop system go home . We aim determine effect closed-loop computer algorithm keep glucose level 3.9 10.0 mmol/L daytime overnight .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The main objective study determine efficacy , safety utility automate closed-loop glucose control home set short term period , include daytime activity normal daily living . This study build previous on-going study closed-loop system perform Cambridge child adolescent type 1 diabetes clinical research facility home setting . The data experience gain study utilise plan future home study . This open-label , single-centre , randomise , crossover study , involve two , 7 day ( phase 1 ) 21 day ( phase 2 ) home study period glucose level control either automate closed-loop system subject ' usual insulin pump therapy combine continuous glucose monitoring random order . A total 30 child adolescent age 10 18 year T1D insulin pump therapy recruit diabetes clinic , allow 12 complete subject available assessment study phase . Subjects receive appropriate training research team safe use closed-loop insulin delivery system . During train visit clinical research centre , subject encourage mimic usual daily activity allow walk inside hospital premise . Subjects advise discontinue automate closed-loop insulin delivery follow usual insulin pump therapy certain activity period strenuous exercise 7 day ( phase 1 ) 21 day ( phase 2 ) home study phase . The primary outcome time spend target range 3.9 10.0 mmol/L record CGM ( conservatively adjust potential over-estimation ) . Secondary outcome time spend glucose level target , record CGM , CGM-based metric . Safety evaluation comprise tabulation severe hypoglycaemic episode .</detailed_description>
