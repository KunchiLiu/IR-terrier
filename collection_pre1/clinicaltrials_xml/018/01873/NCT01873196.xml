	<detailed_description>The first stage study involve work procurement program staff ensure oil CSB available time sufficient quantity distribute together . We work program staff outside consultant ( need ) develop locally acceptable recipe CSB plus oil . A sample community MCHN program choose , intervention ( consistent provision CSB oil , teach recipe use CSB oil , appropriate behavioral support ) implement . Tufts locally contract researcher interview program staff involve procurement supply chain management well program staff , beneficiary , assess feasibility acceptability provision CSB oil , identify barrier problem . This stage expect take six month . In second stage study , CSB distribute new , small package half sample community , half continue normal distribution . In preparation stage , first stage , Tufts researcher arrange production/packaging sufficient supply CSB new package , contract local communication specialist develop appropriate message , available time second stage study . Tufts locally contract researcher collect information program staff perception feasibility impact change , interview beneficiary determine use CSB whether use change change packaging/messaging . We may track effect intrahousehold share self report consumption among family member . This stage last six month , data collection beneficiary conduct six month start intervention . In addition interview focus group discussion , collect sample porridge prepared order ass proportion oil , conduct market observation determine whether increase distribution oil affect availability price market , whether market access affect beneficiary mother ' compliance recommend preparation method . We conduct small number in-home observation observe beneficiary mother ' practice respect storage , preparation , feed child , might aware .
