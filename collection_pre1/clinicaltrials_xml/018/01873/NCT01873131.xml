	<brief_summary>The purpose study find pulsed dye laser treatment timolol maleate 0.5 % gel help infant hemangioma . The investigator also want find pulsed dye laser treatment timolol maleate 0.5 % gel safe use without cause many side effect . Hemangioma common type birthmark . These birthmark happen many new blood vessel grow specific area skin . Blood vessel tiny tube carry blood body . No one know cause blood vessel group together . Most birthmarks n't hurt usually n't sign kind illness . Lots newborns birthmarks body , like eyebrow . These birthmark usually disappear within first month year life . These birthmark tend disappear spontaneously . Most hemangiomas treated unless hemangioma threaten child 's health , occur 1 3 child hemagiomas . Pulsed dye laser widely use child , approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat hemangioma . The FDA approve timolol maleate treat glaucoma adult , FDA approve timolol maleate treat hemangiomas child . About 7 infant hemangiomas receive timolol maleate . The result far show timolol maleate may helpful safe treat hemangioma infant . An important question test study whether pulsed-dye laser timolol maleate prevent hemangioma grow use early birth .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Pulsed-dye Laser Versus Timolol Topical Solution Versus Observation Growth Hemangioma Newborn</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemangiomas affect 5-10 % child bear United States 20 % premature infant , high incidence girl . Most infantile hemangioma ( IHs ) appear within week birth , grow rapidly month year eventually involute . `` Benign neglect '' ( treatment ) therefore recommend pediatrician . However , 1/3 case ( 2-3 % child bear US ) eventually require medical surgical intervention hemangiomas due block vision , problem breathe , feeding , pain , ulceration , infection , profuse bleed disfigurement . None intervention benign . Occasionally , hemangioma may fatal . The broad objective study prevent injury disfigurement million child per year develop safe , effective , non-invasive treatment inhibits growth cutaneous hemangioma newborn . Historically , pulse dye laser know bea effective safe treatment hemangioma ; however , treatment modality study treatment early hemangioma . Recently , systemic beta-blockade propanolol also show remarkable result treat threaten hemangioma . However , systemic propanolol benign require inpatient monitoring cardiac side effect . Topical beta-blocker demonstrate case report prevent growth infantile eyelid hemangioma . We propose prospective , single blind , randomize study pulse dye laser ( PDL ) topical beta-blocker solution ( timolol maleate ophthalmic gel form solution ) treatment early hemangioma . Specifically efficacy , side effect outcome PDL timolol compare treatment , present standard care early stage hemangioma . The extent early laser treatment topical timolol treatment prevents tumor growth need future medical surgical treatment determine . Infants recruit pediatric neonatal practice Massachusetts General Hospital , randomize receive either : ( 1 ) series weekly semi-weekly laser treatment , ( 2 ) twice daily topical application timolol ophthalmic gel-forming solution six week , ( 3 ) treatment . Hemangiomas assess clinically digital photography serial repeat measure hemangioma size study visit . A panel blind evaluator also provide assessment photograph . Response , side effect need additional treatment record 2 year PDL topical timolol treatment . This clinical trial fill large gap evidence-based medical therapy IHs . If indeed early laser treatment hemangioma PDL topical timolol , relatively harmless treatment , eliminate potential complication treat hemangioma prior growth phase , trial would present attractive solution problem treat .</detailed_description>
