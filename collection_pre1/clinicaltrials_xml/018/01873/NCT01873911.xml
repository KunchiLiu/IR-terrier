	<brief_summary>Hypothesis # 1 : Factor analysis revise Sanfilippo Behavior Rating Scale ( SBRS ) identify group externalize behavior group Klüver-Bucy syndrome-like behavior two different factor least partially independent . Hypothesis # 2a : Children MPS III show hyperlocomotion , fearlessness , asociality noncompliance child similar cognitive ability MPS I. Hypothesis # 2b : These behavior become frequent and/or intensify time , consistent Cleary Wraith ( 1993 ) model . Quantifying provide empirical framework stag disease progression . Hypothesis # 3 : Brain volumetric analysis diffusion-tensor image reveal abnormality frontal temporal lobe structure correlate externalize Klüver-Bucy syndrome-like behavior , respectively . Hypothesis # 4 . Loss cognitive language function measure neurologic decline directly precede co-vary behavioral decline . The primary objective study identify behavioral phenotype neural basis MPS III ( Sanfilippo syndrome ) . Is behavioral phenotype similar Klüver-Bucy syndrome , evidence amygdala abnormality ? The secondary objective research study develop easily administer , sensitive specific neurobehavioral neuroimaging marker characterize behavioral phenotype ( ) MPS III ; track progression ; delineate neural substrate . Such marker critical identifying stage disease patient , measure treatment outcome . Although know severe cognitive decline one essential characteristic MPS III , highly salient characteristic range abnormal disruptive behavior include , go well beyond , childhood noncompliance oppositionality . These behavior set Sanfilippo syndrome apart MPS disorder . They cause major disruption child 's familial , school , community environment . Delineating behavioral abnormality help well understanding neurological disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Like mucopolysaccharidosis ( MPS ) syndromes , MPS III ( Sanfilippo syndrome ) characterize severe cognitive decline end dementia death . Unlike MPS syndrome , earlier-stage MPS III also associate range abnormal disruptive behavior include , go well beyond , childhood noncompliance oppositionality . These behavior , cause major disruption child 's familial , school , community environment , set MPS III apart MPS disorder . These behavior may also indicate identity neural pathway affect disease ; sequence onset may indicate order pathway affect . We propose define categorize behavioral profile ( ) phenotype ( ) MPS III correlate clinical quantitative neuroimaging order understand neural base disease . In addition , use result develop set sensitive specific measure easily administer health care professional help monitor disease efficacy future treatment .</detailed_description>
