	<brief_summary>This study seek compare 4 know QT prolong drug versus placebo determine effect electrophysiological clinical parameter . The underlie purpose determine depolarization repolarization effect cause drug differ ionic channel mechanisms distinguish one another , gauge sensitivity specificity novel signal analysis detection depolarization repolarization change . Secondarily , evaluate exposure response relationship drug induce effect heart rate biomarker relationship .</brief_summary>
