	<brief_summary>Concussion , mild traumatic injury common child adolescent , complex pathophysiological process affect brain . The lay press inundate report tragic consequence concussion , child immune . Persistent postconcussive symptom ( PCS ) define persistence somatic , cognitive , physical , psychological behavioural change last one month follow injury . PCS significantly impact child family 's quality life school absenteeism , depress mood loss activity . Validated , easy-to-use prognosticator exist clinician identify child high risk PCS . As result , physician accurately inform child parent whether expect long symptom , initiate pharmacotherapy management reduce occurrence severity PCS . The investigator objective derive validate clinical prediction rule development PCS child adolescent present emergency department ( ED ) follow acute head injury . The investigator three aim : ( 1 ) determine PCS incidence one-month follow-up child age 5-17 sustain concussion ; ( 2 ) derive rule predict PCS variable present history physical examination ; , ( 3 ) ass accuracy , reliability acceptability prediction rule subsequent cohort . Using prospective , multicentre study nine large Canadian pediatric EDs , investigator recruit large prospective epidemiological cohort child concussion literature . This work provide rigorous evidence determine PCS incidence child impact quality life . The result enable clinician identify child high risk PCS , optimize treatment provide family realistic anticipatory guidance . This study also establish strong vital evidence base advance concussion research .</brief_summary>
