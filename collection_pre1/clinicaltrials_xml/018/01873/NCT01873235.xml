	<brief_summary>Advances understand pathogenesis autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ( ADPKD ) open possibility new therapy prevent disease progression . High quality clinical investigation patient ADPKD , however , pose significant challenge investigator include limited access patient ADPKD , insufficient guidance experience investigator lack resource conduct study . The Polycystic Kidney Disease Research Clinical Translational Core ( P30 ) aim establish infrastructure assist investigator design conduct high quality clinical translational research focus diverse group patient ADPKD . Objective 1 : To establish Mid-Atlantic cohort ADPKD patient ( N=200 ) baseline clinical phenotyping perform General Clinical Research Unit University Maryland School Medicine . Objective 2 : To establish state-of-the-art biobank specimen ADPKD cohort include serum , plasma , urine DNA . Objective 3 : To develop collaborative network physician practice Mid-Atlantic region contribute ADPKD cohort willing refer patient future study trial . Objective 4 : To establish web-based registry ADPKD patient Mid-Atlantic area .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PKD Clinical Translational Core Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study establish prospective observational cohort 200 well-characterized adult ADPKD , associate biorepository DNA , plasma , serum , urine . Baseline clinical phenotyping include measurement renal filtration function , total kidney volume , clinical family history , presence history renal extra-renal ADPKD manifestation , cardiac function , vascular stiffness , health-related quality life . Prospective characterization include development ADPKD complication ( e.g. , infection , stone , cyst hemorrhage ) acute medical event , change symptoms QoL . In addition , electronic PKD patient registry collect demographic contact information adult ADPKD interest participate future clinical trial and/or observational cohort study . No treatment intervention perform observational study</detailed_description>
