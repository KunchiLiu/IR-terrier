	<brief_summary>Background Purposes : Orthognathic surgery necessary 25 % patient cleft lip palate ( CLP ) correct skeletal discrepancy obtain harmonious facial esthetic final phase treatment . A setback mandible bilateral sagittal split osteotomy ( BSSO ) along maxillary osteotomy usually perform large skeletal discrepancy associate mandibular deformity ( e.g. , asymmetry , cant mandibular occlusal plane ) present . Although surgical technique BSSO well-developed , neurosensory disturbance inferior alveolar nerve ( IAN ) remain one major postoperative complication . The purpose study identify risk factor IAN disturbance BSSO turn help clinician avoid complication raise satisfaction level patient . Design : Prospective prognosis study . Setting : Chang Gung Craniofacial Center , Taoyuan . Patients : Two hundred Taiwanese patient nonsyndromic CLP ( age , &gt; 16 female , &gt; 18 male ) , undergo BSSO part correction dentofacial deformity Measurements : All patient undergo subjective ( e.g. , questionnaire ) objective ( e.g. , 2-point discrimination , light touch detection , sharp/blunt detection ) neurosensory assessment surgery , 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 24 month surgery . Cone beam compute tomography perform surgery 1 week surgery . Peri-operative factor include type BSSO , extent surgical correction , extent split fixation screw , concomitant genioplasty third molar extraction assess . Patient-related factor include age , gender , bone quality inferior alveolar canal record well . Data Analysis : Univariate multivariate analysis perform . Statistical significance assume p value less 0.05 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Orthognathic surgery usually final phase treatment patient cleave lip palate ( CLP ) . More 25 % patient CLP develop significant maxillary hypoplasia require surgical intervention , maxillary osteotomy , therefore , commonly perform patient . If sagittal discrepancy large associate mandibular deformity ( e.g. , asymmetry , cant mandibular occlusal plane ) , simultaneous setback mandible perform . The bilateral sagittal split osteotomy ( BSSO ) become preferred mandibular osteotomy many center treatment mandibular deformity . Nevertheless , treatment know give rise various complication ; sensory disturbance inferior alveolar nerve ( IAN ) probably common one incidence range 8 % 85 % . Such sensory disturbance may affect patient ' quality life due difficulty speech , eat drinking . Patients may also complain inability ass tactile stimulus put lipstick , shave kissing , may lead psychological social issue . IAN disturbance believe caused iatrogenic injury nerve include excessive nerve manipulation , nerve laceration , fixation segment incorrect placement position screw , large mandibular movement bad split . Identification risk factor IAN disturbance BSSO help clinician prevent raise satisfaction level patient . It generally think injury IAN inside mandibular ramus body surgery highly correlate variation preoperative anatomy ( ie , patient-related factor ) . Previous compute tomography ( CT ) study report anatomical variation include thickness length ramus , position bone density inferior alveolar nerve canal ( IAC ) thickness buccal lingual cortical plate . However , study try identify surgery-related factor type BSSO , extent surgical correction , extent split , concomitant genioplasty third molar extraction . Furthermore , study retrospective design limited number patient conduct multivariate analysis recognize influence patient- surgery-related risk factor IAN disturbance . Moreover , heterogeneity assessment time method IAN disturbance previous study prevent overall assessment degree IAN recovery . We therefore aim ( 1 ) determine incidence IAN injury BSSO , ( 2 ) identify risk factor associate injury , ( 3 ) understand consequence injury include degree neurologic recovery perform prospective , longitudinal study .</detailed_description>
