	<brief_summary>If participant voluntarily agree participate clinical trial registration , investigator conduct screen test evaluate participant 's suitability . A participant satisfies selection exclusion criterion assign randomly test group ( 1-time 2-time injection group ) control group ( no-cell therapy group ) . Participants assign 1-time injection group conduct cell therapy within 1 month bone marrow aspiration . Before implement cell therapy , implement hepatic artery catheterization insert catheter hepatic artery right aorta femoralis inject 5X107 autologous bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell . Participants assign 2-time injection group store 1-time injection amount mesenchymal stem cell cultivate sampled bone marrow , re-inject autologous mesenchymal stem cell within 1 month first injection .
