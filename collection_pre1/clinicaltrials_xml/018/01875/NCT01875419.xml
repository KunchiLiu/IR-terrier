	<brief_summary>Depression serious mental health problem affect million . Depression usually treat use drug and/or psychotherapy , neither approach successful everyone , people respond either . Therefore crucial continue seek new method treat depression , develop enhancement exist treatment . In recent year , trial document improvement depressive symptom use noninvasive brain stimulation technique , transcranial direct current stimulation , tDCS . Our aim research investigate effect brain stimulation combine psychological therapy depression , area remain largely unexplored . Specifically , stimulation dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) , brain region know work inefficiently depression , show result improvement depressive symptom , well patient 's 'cognitive control ' ability . Because 'cognitive control ' process , concentrate ignore distract thought , engage psychological therapy depression , predict DLPFC stimulation improve patient respond psychological therapy . This study considerable implication potentially benefit large number patient current treatment ineffective .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-invasive Brain Stimulation Cognitive Processing Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We propose investigate effect apply transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) leave dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( LDLPFC ) immediately prior 8 session cognitive behavioural therapy ( CBT ) , type psychological therapy . In addition investigate whether tDCS effect CBT due change cognitive control use behavioural neuroimaging measure . We hypothesize tDCS , thanks endure effect , improve benefit CBT , enhancement cognitive control patient . Null hypothesis : mood cognitive performance equivalent depressed individual undergo tDCS undergo sham stimulation . Experimental hypothesis : mood cognitive performance improve depressed individual undergo tDCS relative undergo sham stimulation . Sixty patient suffer depression recruit , double-blind , sham-controlled , randomised design use . This design mean neither participant researcher aware condition assign , choose eliminate participant expectancy ( `` placebo '' ) effect researcher bias . To ensure 30 participant include group , use balance assignment algorithm entry study , maximise statistical power . Since result study type never previously report ( knowledge ) , clinical equipoise exists , mandate use sham stimulation arm . Patients depression randomly assign one two group : tDCS sham stimulation . To ensure 30 participant include group , use balance assignment algorithm entry study . The whole study spread 16 week participant following time course : - start : baseline MRI brain scan complete cognitive control task; measure depressive symptom - week 1 8 : one session per week tDCS sham stimulation ( 20 min , complete cognitive control task ) immediately follow CBT ( 1 hour ) ; measure depressive symptom - end week 8 : post-treatment MRI scan complete cognitive control task measure depressive symptom - week 9 16 : one session per week CBT usual ( 1 hour ) without stimulation - end week 16 , end CBT ( whichever sooner ) : measure depressive symptom MRI scan two purpose , ( 1 ) localise area DLPFC stimulation , ( 2 ) compare brain response cognitive control task treatment . The tDCS deliver use neuroConn stimulators . A 1 milliamp ( mA ) current deliver 20 minute damp sponge soak saline solution attach head patient use cap . One electrode place forehead LDLPFC , leave shoulder blade leave cheek record baseline electrical signal . In sham condition , brief current change begin end stimulation session , order mimic effect actual stimulation , current deliver . CBT session deliver weekly , immediately tDCS sham stimulation first 8 week , provide qualified psychological therapist part standard National Health Services ( NHS ) care . Mood assess start study ( first MRI scan ) , week 8 week stimulation phase , second MRI scan 16 week , use Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) . Patients perform task ass cognitive control abilities MRI scan , well 8 stimulation session . During task , visual stimulus present subject , make different response stimuli press button response box .</detailed_description>
