	<brief_title>Effects Caffeine Intermittent Hypoxia Infants Born Preterm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Infants prior clinical treatment caffeine neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) enrol continuous physiologic data record oxygen hemoglobin saturation ( HbO2 SAT ) heart rate begin early 33 week postmenstrual age ( PMA ) . Randomization occur enrol infant reach correct gestational age least 34 week PMA AND clinical caffeine discontinue least 5 day . Infants randomize receive caffeine continue usual care . The group randomize start caffeine receive oral load dose caffeine citrate 20 mg/kg Day # 1 , follow single daily oral maintenance dose 6 mg/kg start Day # 2 continue daily thereafter 40 week PMA . The continuous oximeter recording stop time . The number intermittent hypoxia events/hour per week compare caffeine group usual care ( no-caffeine ) group week physiologic data recording .</detailed_description>
