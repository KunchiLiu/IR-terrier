	<brief_summary>STUDY OBJECTIVES : The main objective study determine feasibility implement measure ICU , base physiological algorithm , reverse decrease cerebral oxygen saturation use , near infrared-reflected spectroscopy ( NIRS ) . WHAT IS INVOLVED : Randomization 50 patient balanced experimental group ; control intervention , allocation sequence base block size ten , generate computer random number generator . In INTERVENTION group ICU Staff use NIRS follow physiologically guide strategy maintain rSO2 within 90 % baseline value . In CONTROL group ICU Staff provide standard care without use NIRS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Rationale Cerebral desaturation previously show associate significant morbidity cardiac surgery postoperatively . As , previously report effort aim treat intraoperative desaturation event , early evidence suggesting may reduce incidence adverse event . Our previous study , NIRS ICU ( B2011:110 ) demonstrate significant cerebral oxygen desaturation [ measure use near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) derive cerebral oximetry ] frequently occur intensive care unit ( ICU ) within first 24 hour follow cardiac surgery . To date , study address early postoperative period ( i.e . ICU ) respect treat ( and/or prevent ) desaturation event . Specific Aims Experimental Design The specific aim pilot prospective interventional trial determine feasibility/efficacy treat cerebral oxygen desaturation ICU follow cardiac surgery . Two group patient study . Both group cerebral saturation measure continuously intraoperatively postoperatively . The control group however , measurement blind intraoperative postoperative caregiver . The interventional group cerebral oximetry measurement available intraoperative postoperative care team allow intervene desaturation event occur . If cerebral desaturation occurs , define decline saturation 10 % patient 's preoperative baseline , previously utilized interventional algorithm , NORMOSAT ( B2012:005 ) , instituted reverse decrease cerebral saturation , ideally prevent become clinically meaningful desaturation ( previously define others saturation decline 25 % baseline ) . The algorithm use address many know cause desaturation , include low arterial oxygen content ( saturation hemoglobin ) cardiac output influence cerebral blood flow . As , desaturation occurs , patient first PaO2 increase increase inspired oxygen content . The PaCO2 also normalize adjust ventilator setting . The cardiac output optimize blood pressure increase standard ICU protocol administer phenylephrine . If remain low , patient transfuse standard care hemoglobin level . In pilot trial , convenience sample 50 consecutive consenting patient undergoing cardiac surgery employ CPB study . After obtain consent , bilateral cerebral oximetry sensor place forehead patient prior induction anesthesia . Baseline ( breathe room air ) regional cerebral saturation ( rSO2 ) record . Following , induction anesthesia occur continuous NIRS measurement collect surgical procedure continue monitor occur first 24 hour ( discharge ) within ICU . In control group , conventional anesthesia ICU standard care carry throughout study period . In interventional group , algorithm base modification previously define important physiologic variable initiate reverse desaturation ( begin saturation drop least 10 % baseline ) occur OR ICU .</detailed_description>
