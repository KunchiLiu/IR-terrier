	<brief_title>Effect Transcutaneous Electrostimulation ( TENS ) Pain Physical Function Patients With Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Osteoarthritis ( OA ) common arthritic condition , one lead cause disability adult . Currently , treatment stop reverse progressive joint degeneration cause OA . Most clinical intervention aim improve pain physical function . Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) widely use management knee OA relieve osteoarthritic pain facilitate performance therapeutic activity order maintain improve physical function . Although use widespread , available evidence questionable quality . An adequately size well conduct randomize control trial ( RCT ) investigate effectiveness safety TENS treatment modality knee OA warrant assist clinician policy maker make decision base high-quality evidence , ultimately optimize delivery health-care knee OA . Objective To determine TENS safety effectiveness pain physical function compare sham TENS patient knee OA . Methods Multi-center , randomize , double blind ( patient assessor ) , sham control clinical trial use parallel 2 group design . Patients randomly allocate receive TENS sham TENS 3 week . Informed consent eligible patient obtain prior randomization . Patients assign 1:1 basis TENS sham TENS group . Randomization centralize use randomization software electronic randomization form , generate trial coordinate centre ( CTU Bern ) . Patients randomized demographic data selection criterion complete recruit physician electronic form . Randomization stratify accord treatment centre , TENS naivety clinical severity .</detailed_description>
