	<brief_summary>Background : - People human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) sometimes develop think memory problem . These problem vary widely , symptom severe problem memory concentration . It initially think good HIV treatment could prevent almost HIV-related memory problem . However , even people low HIV viral load problem . It may cause HIV affect brain spinal fluid . It yet clear HIV cause problem may worse people others . Researchers want study people HIV healthy volunteer see HIV may affect people small amount virus blood . Objectives : - To study think memory problem individual HIV otherwise control medication . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 61 year age whose HIV control medication least 1 year . - Healthy volunteer 18 61 year age . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . A neurological test also give . Participants baseline image study brain . - Within 12 week first visit , participant second visit . Additional blood sample draw . Another brain imaging study perform . - Within 8 week second visit , participant third visit collect blood sample . They also provide spinal fluid sample , either single visit longer procedure . - After visit , participant return every 6 month 5 year . Blood sample collect need visit . Thinking memory test image study may also give need . Spinal fluid may collect one visit year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The natural history neurocognitive impairment human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) -infected individual remain poorly understood . While advent highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) lead decreased incidence severe form HIV associate neurocognitive disorder ( HAND ) , HIV-associated dementia , appear impact overall prevalence HAND . Existing evidence suggest central nervous system ( CNS ) could important reservoir HIV regardless cumulative time treatment . This 8 year multi-institute screen protocol identify approximately 200 HIV-infected individual 100 healthy volunteer enrollment multiple HAND study National Institutes Health ( NIH ) . Subjects undergo one-time screening evaluation assessment , include neuropsychological testing , optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) may include detailed ophthalmic evaluation . Those meet eligibility criterion offer enrollment co-enrollment active HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder protocol , include natural history study present . This observational study characterize natural course HAND subject HIV viral load &lt; 200 copies/mm ( 3 ) . Subjects follow every 6 month 5 year undergo follow-up neuropsychological testing , OCT brain MRI well positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( PET/CT ) image lumbar puncture optional drain Those receive detailed ophthalmic evaluation may receive similar follow-up annual evaluation . Cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) marker immune activation , chronic monocyte activation , cytomegalovirus/Epstein-Barr virus ( CMV/EBV ) infection/reactivation , neuronal injury collect . In addition , HIV viral load genotype , genetic susceptibility factor CNS penetration-effectiveness score ( CPE ) CSF level antiretroviral drug assess . A repository cryopreserved biological sample develop use validation candidate biomarkers future study . Collection analysis data enhance understanding CNS potential HIV reservoir virally-controlled individual define association among cortical thickness , biomarkers neurocognitive function age HIV-infected population .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR PART I SCREENING STUDY : INCLUSION CRITERIA : All Subjects ( HIVinfected Healthy Controls ) : While different individual HIV neurocognitive study specific selection criterion , especially related HIV viral load antiretroviral therapy , inclusion criterion overarch protocol flexible order identify broad base potential enrollee possible . An upper age limit 61 year old use change neurocognitive function occur commonly general population age . 1 . Men woman , 1861 year old 2 . Ability sign inform consent subject 3 . At least seventh grade educational level ability speak , read , understand English . Education level assess subject selfreport . Because many neuropsychological subtests validate use United States norm , subject must native English speaker foreignborn , demonstrate ability understand English language time screen protocol consent neuropsychological testing . HIVinfected Only : 1 . HIV1 infection , document OraQuick rapid test use venipuncture whole blood , fingerstick whole blood do screening ; HIV1/HIV2 Multispot rapid test Western Blot determine NIH Clinical Pathology Laboratory Leidos Biomedical Research . Monitoring Laboratory . 2 . Outside primary medical doctor provide care Healthy Controls Only : 1.HIVantibody negative EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Screening Study ( participant ) : 1 . Illness condition , opinion PI , may interfere study participation time enrollment , include , limited list : 1 . CNS infection : include limited Varicella zoster virus ( VZV ) encephalitis , CNS lymphoma toxoplasmosis . Subjects recover effectively treat CNS infection may consider resume baseline daily activity . 2 . NonCNS opportunistic infection : subject recover complete treatment nonCNS opportunistic infection ( OIs ) ( e.g. , Pneumocystis pneumonia , Candida esophagitis , pulmonary TB ) enrol return selfreported baseline activity functional level . 2 . Conditions HAND associate cognitive impairment dementia Alzheimer , Parkinson disease , head injury loss consciousness &gt; 30 minute , untreated sleep apnea daytime sleepiness , seizure disorder . Subjects history seizure disorder seizure activity stable , nonsedating antiseizure regimen &gt; 6 month may enrol . 3 . Concurrent severe , unstable psychiatric illness , opinion investigator , may interfere study participation and/or data interpretation . Subjects psychotropic anxiolytic , attention deficithyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) , psychiatric medication may include clinically stable &gt; 6 month . 4 . Concurrent substance abuse , opinion investigator may interfere study participation and/or data interpretation . Active substance abuse include illegal drug use and/or excessive narcotic alcohol use determine investigator . Urine drug screen perform subject screen . Use nicotine containing product exclusion criterion . 5 . Contraindication MRI/ MRS scanning , include pacemaker implant electrical device , brain stimulators , type dental implant , aneurysm clip ( metal clip wall large artery ) , metallic prosthesis ( include metal pin rod , heart valve , cochlear implant ) , permanent eyeliner , implanted delivery pump , shrapnel fragment . Patients require low dose oral lorazepam mild moderate claustrophobia allow participate . 6 . Medications : narcotic , psychiatric , antiseizure medication allow except certain condition note . Corticosteroids may permit subject stable shortterm therapy without CNS disease ( i.e. , resolve Pneumocystis pneumonia ) . Participants must willing take follow medication within 48 hour neuropsychological testing : sedating antihistamine diphenhydramine , zolpidem drug identify study team associate alter alertness impaired memory . 7 . Pregnant Lactating woman : Women childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 1 week prior study entry . Pregnancy test also perform enrol female participant prior radiation exposure . ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR PART II NATURAL HISTORY STUDY : INCLUSION CRITERIA : Natural History Study ( HIVinfected Individuals ) : In addition inclusion criterion screen study ( see ) 1 . Nadir CD4 cell count &lt; 200 cells/mm ( 3 ) 2 . Plasma HIVRNA &lt; 50 copies/mm ( 3 ) BLD great one year . Patients experience transitory episode HIV viral load &gt; 50 copies/mm ( 3 ) precede follow plasma viremia &lt; 50 copies/mm ( 3 ) may include . 3 . At least one year continuous ART 4 .
