	<detailed_description>Until recently , understand kinome limit 5-10 % genome-encoded kinase . This limited knowledge prevents thorough understand resistance mechanism , precludes individualize HER2-targeted therapy HER2+ disease . Fortunately , develop chemical proteomics approach define comprehensive kinome activity cell tumor ( MIB/MS ) . [ 1 ] We hypothesize proteomics approach use characterize heterogeneity kinome activation profile HER2+ breast cancer permit u identify adaptive response HER2 inhibition differs depend anti-HER2 drug mechanism action . This allow rational prediction new combinatorial therapy future clinical trial . To explore kinome activation population , propose window trial stage I-IV HER2+ patient schedule undergo definitive surgery ( either lumpectomy , mastectomy surgical resection oligometastatic disease ) . Enrolled patient randomize one four treatment arm ; A ) single dose trastuzumab ; B ) single dose pertuzumab ; C ) combination trastuzumab + pertuzumab one dose ; D ) combination single dose trastuzumab plus lapatinib daily one week . Dosing arm initiate 7 day prior surgery , pre- post-dosing tissue sample analyze kinome response resistant signature . To ensure adequate level trastuzumab pertuzumab time surgery , load dose agent ( 8 mg/kg IV trastuzumab , 840 mg IV fix dose pertuzumab ) chosen . The dose lapatinib base prior study lapatinib administer combination trastuzumab . Given varied pharmacokinetic profile three agent limited dosing , expect exposure level agent different relative respective steady state level . Therefore qualitative rather quantitative measure key .</detailed_description>
