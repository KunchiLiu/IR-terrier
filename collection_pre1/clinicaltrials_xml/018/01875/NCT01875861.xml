	<detailed_description>Treatment psychotic disorder consist primarily antipsychotic medication , associate metabolic side effect overweight/obesity , diabetes , dyslipidemia . Expert consensus evidence-based recommendation develop assessment management condition ; however , research study show deficit delay metabolic monitoring patient prescribed antipsychotic . This purpose study test quality improvement intervention enhance implementation recommendation assess manage metabolic side effect patient prescribe antipsychotic medication . Study Objectives : - Objective 1 : To test effect Evidence-Based Quality Improvement/Facilitation ( EBQI/F ) intervention augmentation national implementation initiative rate monitor metabolic side effect antipsychotics site likely encounter great challenge implementation . - Objective 2 : To test effect EBQI/F intervention augmentation national implementation initiative management metabolic side effect antipsychotics site likely encounter great challenge implementation . - Objective 3 : To assess direct cost EBQI/F intervention , explore potential variation cost EBQI/F intervention site low versus high organizational challenge . Methods This study employ cluster randomized design eligible study site include VA Medical Centers 300 patient receive new antipsychotic prescription first six month FY08 . Twelve sit recruit matched accord level organizational readiness-to-change . Randomization intervention control group conduct within six site-pairs . Study participant include VA employee involve monitoring management patient treat antipsychotic participate site . The intervention involve researcher partner clinical stakeholder , offer tailor local implementation strategy address barrier metabolic side-effect monitoring management . External facilitation support , problem-solve refine implementation provide six-month implementation phase . The effectiveness EBQI/F intervention combine ongoing national quality improvement initiative six site ( intervention site ) compare six match comparison site expose national quality improvement initiative alone ( control sit ) .</detailed_description>
