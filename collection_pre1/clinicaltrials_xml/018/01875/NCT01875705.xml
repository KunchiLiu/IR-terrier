	<brief_summary>This open-label , multicenter , dose-escalation study ass safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics GDC-0994 patient locally advance metastatic solid tumor . Patients enrol one two stage : dose-escalation stage ( Stage I ) subsequent expansion stage ( Stage II ) . Stage I evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics increase dos GDC-0994 administer daily . Stage II gather additional data safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics recommend dose GDC-0994 determine Stage I .</brief_summary>
