	<brief_summary>Pathogens ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) come colonizer trachea . The hypothesis investigator first day intubation , independently use antibiotic , change oro-pharyngeal flora lead selection one pathogen trachea , finally cause VAP . The investigator design prospective study include 300 patient intubated 3 day , daily analysis oro-pharyngeal juice tracheal aspirate culture metagenomics , order determine microbiological surveillance permit : 1 . To predict high risk develop VAP next 48h even predict agent 2 . To good understand development VAP study evolution `` respiratory flora '' context intubation</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY : The ventilator-associated pneumonia ( VAP ) responsible almost half infection acquire intensive care , affect 28 % mechanically ventilated patient mortality rate range 25 50 % . The majority VAP originate sub-glottic juice accumulates endotracheal tube cuff . Many preventive measure exist applied institution , include oropharyngeal aspiration every 4 hour tracheal aspirate every 8 hour . Currently , aspirate simply discard . However , French study evaluate colonization infection respiratory tract patient acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) highlight causative agent VAP select 2/3 case tracheal aspirate several day VAP . This suggest `` microbiological surveillance '' daily aspirate may permit identification select respiratory pathogen later responsible VAP . Parallel , rapid development genomics highlight role flora ( microbiota ) link disease ( eg , colitis intestinal microbiota inflammatory ) . This area also emerge field respiratory tract infection , example patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) asthma . There description yet metagenomics change respiratory flora patient intubate without VAP , neither evaluation benefit approach relation classical microbiology . The investigator believe study respiratory flora ventilate patient could provide clue good understand development VAP . METHODOLOGY ( plan , inclusion objective ) : Prospective study 300 intubated patient recruit period 2 year , tracheal aspirate oropharyngeal juice collect daily analyzed culture metagenomics , instead simply discard . The result analyze use research purpose ( culture metagenomics parallel ) . The main objective determine whether daily monitor oropharyngeal juice tracheal aspirate culture identifies selection pathogen among colonize flora , would predictive onset VAP 48-72 hour . The secondary objective obtain new knowledge kinetics colonization respiratory infection intubate patient , compare advantage disadvantage metagenomic approach compare culture context , study influence antibiotherapy context .</detailed_description>
