	<brief_summary>The purpose research evaluate safety effectiveness tumor cell therapy . This research study evaluate patient-specific experimental therapy metastatic melanoma lengthen survival minimal harmful effect . It call experimental therapy ( `` study therapy '' ) yet approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . This research study use patient 's tumor cell , patient 's dendritic cell ( type immune cell ) , granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulate factor ( GM-CSF , type growth factor ) . GM-CSF natural growth factor stimulate growth white blood cell body . Since 1991 , GM-CSF use standard treatment help increase number white blood cell chemotherapy . The patient 's dendritic cell grow test-tube patient 's tumor cell growth factor . The result solution call study therapy . The intent study therapy make dendritic cell effective fight tumor inject back patient .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : PreTreatment Phase : Tissue Procurement Establishment Tumor Cell Line 1 . Histologic diagnosis invasive melanoma . 2 . Measurable metastatic melanoma least one lesion amenable resection Stage III : recurrent regional disease , include regional disease know primary . Stage IV : distant metastatic melanoma . 3 . Age 18 year old . 4 . Sign `` Tissue Consent '' , preClinical Informed Consent Melanoma Tissue Procurement initiation cell line effort grant Caladrius permission cryopreserve tumor and/or initiate autologous tumor cell line excess tissue remove medical procedure ( e.g. , surgically excise ) . 5 . Initiation Autologous Tumor Cell Line . Caladrius must receive viable melanoma tumor tissue specimen obtain process accord company SOPs ensure tissue viability . The cell line initiate either specimen fresh tumor tumor previously cryopreserved . Treatment Phase 1 . Successful establishment autologous melanoma cell line Caladrius . 2 . Patients multiple depot distant metastatic disease must previously receive least one follow standard treatment : interleukin 2 ( IL2 ) , ipilimumab , vemurafenib ( tumor express V600E mutation ) , dacarbazine temozolomide , mutate V600E mutation , felt medically appropriate IL2 ipilimumab . These may give alone , combination agent . 3 . Medical fitness undergo leukapheresis , include peripheral venous access access central vein necessary . 4 . Medical fitness participation phase III clinical trial . a. ECOG performance status 0 1. b . Adequate bone marrow function : absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great 1000/mm ( 3 ) , hematocrit great 30 % , platelet count great 100,000/mm ( 3 ) , ongoing transfusion requirement . c. Adequate hepatic function : total bilirubin le 2.0 mg/dL , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) less 3 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) , albumin great 3 g/dL . d. Adequate kidney function : creatinine le equal 2.0 mg/dL . e. Negative pregnancy test woman childbearing potential use effective contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ) therapy ( woman childbearing potential men ) . 5 . Extent disease establish within 4 week randomization . . History Physical Exam license practitioner . b. Fludeoxyglucose ( FDG ) base PET/CT PET scan CT scan . c. Brain MRI demonstrate new untreated uncontrolled metastasis . 6 . Recovery previous therapy . . At least four week ( 28 day ) must elapse since prior systemic therapy time first dose ( six week anticytotoxic T lymphocyteassociated antigen 4 ( antiCTLA4 ) , toxicity experience must recover grade 1 less ( except alopecia vitiligo ) . b . More three week ( least 22 day ) since radiation therapy time first dose ( 7 day singledose stereotactic radiotherapy gamma knife ) recovery acute toxicity . Patients treated whole brain radiation must wait least 22 day completion radiation radiographic confirmation lack progression proceed randomization . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : PreTreatment Phase : Tissue Procurement Establishment Tumor Cell Line 1 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status great 2 2 . Lack metastatic melanoma lesion resect . Treatment Phase 1 . Known positive hepatitis B C HIV . 2 . Pregnant lactating woman . 3 . Underlying cardiac disease associate know myocardial dysfunction , active treatment digoxin medication give treat heart failure , unstable angina relate atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease . 4 . Diagnosis invasive cancer require ongoing treatment evidence active disease . 5 . Active , unresolved infection and/or receive concurrent treatment parenteral antibiotic ( patient eligible antibiotic discontinue least 7 day prior first dose evidence infection resolve ) . 6 . Other active medical condition could imminently life threatening , opinion investigator , include active blood clot bleed diathesis . 7 . New uncontrolled brain metastasis leptomeningeal disease and/or take pharmacological dos corticosteroid . Brain metastasis treat gamma knife stereotactic radiotherapy consider control , unless patient require pharmacologic dos corticosteroid . It recognize tumor necrosis may confuse tumor progression interpretation Brain MRI . 8 . Known autoimmune disease , immunodeficiency , disease process involve use immunosuppressive therapy . 9 . Taking anticancer therapy . 10 . Received another investigational drug within 28 day first dose .</criteria>
