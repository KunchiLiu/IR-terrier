	<brief_title>Bacterial Pneumonia Score ( BPS ) Guided Antibiotic Use Children With Pneumonia Pneumococcal Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Pneumonia lead cause mortality child . Despite 50 % pneumonia due virus , difficult rule bacterial etiology , initial management pneumonia child usually include antibiotic , often unnecessary . In 2006 design validated clinical prediction rule ( BPS : Bacterial Pneumonia Score ) accurately identify hospitalized child 's risk bacterial pneumonia . Recently , assess BPS efficacy reduce antibiotic use 50 % child CAP , ambulatory setting . However , BPS test child vaccinate S. pneumoniae . Aim : The aim study test BPS guide antibiotic use child non severe community acquire pneumonia reduce antibiotic use compare standard care practice ( current guideline CAP ) child vaccinate S. penumoniae . Design : This randomize , control , blind trial , ass antibiotic use regard two method initial management child age 3-60 month non severe community acquire pneumonia pneumoccocal vaccine . Children randomly allocate manage accord BPS currently enforce guideline . Use antibiotic ( % ) clinical outcome group compare . Setting : Tertiary child hospital Buenos Aires , Argentina . Patients : Consecutive child age 3-60 month assist non severe community acquire pneumonia outpatient . Patients wheeze , severe pneumonia , pulmonary cardiovascular chronic disease , antibiotic use hospitalization previous two week exclude . Endpoints : Primary : Use antibiotic group ( proportion ) Secondary : Treatment failure ( proportion ) group Endpoints assess baseline 1 , 2 , 5 , 7 10 day blind investigator . Intervention : Patients CAP randomize ( 1:1 ) BPS versus enforce guideline . In BPS group antibiotic indicate patient BPS â‰¥ 4 point , control group antibiotic indicate accord current guideline . Variables measurement : Antibiotic use define initial use antibiotic , immediately diagnosis . Treatment failure define persistence fever 2 day , tachypnea diminish respiratory rate le 5 bpm . 2 day , sign severe pneumonia require change antibiotic time . Study hypothesis : BPS antibiotic use guidance reduce least 20 % antibiotic use , compare standard care practice . Analyses : These do base intention-to-treat per-protocol principle . With assumed 20 % less use antibiotic intervention group , maximum 5 % loss follow-up , confidence 5 % power 90 % , total sample size 60 . This allow detecting difference clinical outcome 28 % . Proportion compare Chi square test . Interim monitoring : Regular review serious adverse event , quality integrity study independent data safety monitor board . Safety interim analysis 50 % patient recruit . Significance : Due high prevalence CAP child , study offer potential substantial reduction health cost antibiotics resistance .</detailed_description>
