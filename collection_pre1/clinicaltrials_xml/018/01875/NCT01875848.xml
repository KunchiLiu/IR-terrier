	<brief_title>Buprenorphine vs. Opioid Dose Escalation Among Patients With Chronic Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Increasingly , Veterans prescribe potent opioid analgesic treatment chronic pain despite limited evidence efficacy increase evidence serious harm include addiction non-fatal fatal overdose . While guideline recommend consideration dose increase patient benefit opioid therapy , rate major harm directly relate dose . Higher dos may also likely precipitate opioid-induced hyperalgesia , paradoxical increase pain response , susceptible individual . In summary , opioid dose increase , currently accept clinical response poorly control pain , may offer little benefit certainly increase risk , especially patient already moderate-high dos ( 30-100 mg daily morphine equivalent ) . Alternative treatment strategy opioid dose escalation lessen risk possibly increase benefit much need . Switching buprenorphine/naloxone ( BUP/NX ) , partial opioid agonist approve use treatment opioid abuse/dependence , may safe effective alternative strategy opioid dose escalation treatment chronic pain . As partial agonist , ceiling BUP/NX 's respiratory depressant opioid-like effect , mean less likely cause addiction overdose . Additionally , pre-clinical data suggest BUP/NX less likely produce opioid-induced hyperalgesia may even reverse patient switch full agonist opioids . Case series demonstrate improvement pain , functional status quality life among patient switch full agonist opioids BUP/NX chronic pain . Controlled trial need establish BUP/NX 's efficacy compare opioid dose escalation treatment poorly-controlled pain . The investigator propose pilot 12-week , open label randomize trial BUP/NX compare opioid dose escalation among patient poorly-controlled pain primary outcome pain intensity . As patient acceptance either opioid dose escalation BUP/NX unknown , investigator ' first objective ass willingness enroll randomize trial reason enrollment among eligible patient . The study compare treatment primary outcome pain intensity , measure use 11-point pain numerical rating scale , secondary outcome pain interference , use Brief Pain Inventory functional interference subscale , medication adherence patient global assessment change . Mixed model employ analysis accommodate potential unbalance repeated measure miss data . Effect size estimate use generate sample size projection definitive trial . This line research direct extension PI 's HSR &amp; D-funded CDA-2 project develop screen tool identify low efficacy opioid use primary care also well-aligned Strategic Plan Focused Area Research Pain Research , Informatics , Medical comorbidities , Education ( PRIME ) Center 's proposal Center Innovation ( COIN ) strategic objective `` Promote access , continuity , sustainability safe effective intervention pain pain-related disability .
