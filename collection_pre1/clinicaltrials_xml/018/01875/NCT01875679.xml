	<brief_summary>Simulation surgical skill train widely accept necessary step improve surgical training outside operating room . Simulation predominately focus teach specific task procedure . Once task acquire ongoing optimization technique desirable . Commonly ongoing skill assessment occurs form peer feedback throughout train rotation . This feedback frequently subjective variable educational use . Identifying ongoing technical training need enable personalized objective feedback represent important training concept yet formally use resident training . The specific goal study prove effect comprehensive surgical coaching ( CSC ) approach combine concept behavior model training , task debrief error recognition improve overall surgical technique without additional technical skill training .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design The study design randomize , control trial involve evaluation study conventionally train group pretest posttest . Participants The study control group consist senior surgical resident ( PGY 3-5 ) surgical fellow involve minimally invasive surgery ( MIS ) . Inclusion : Since concurrent operative training operating room ( OR ) technique MIS prerequisite study , resident fellows rotation practice focus MIS time period study eligible participation . Exclusion : Individuals severe illness preclude performance OR include . Outcome measure : Surgical performance assess use global rating scale well tabulation observe intraoperative technical error . Primary outcome measure surgical skill level target training .</detailed_description>
