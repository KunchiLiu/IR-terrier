	<brief_title>Treatment Bilateral Maxillofacial Post-traumatic Deformities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient underwent preoperative CT scan . Firstly , SurgiCase use analyze CT data design preliminary surgery plan . Secondly , three-dimensions resin skull model produce rapid prototyping technology . Model surgery perform determine location , reduction direction shift distance osteotomy . Based surgical simulation , preliminary surgery plan validate optimized . Then , titanium plate mesh preshaped model . Finally , accord final surgery plan operation perform . The operation time , therapeutic effect complication observe . The follow-up period 1-12 month .</detailed_description>
