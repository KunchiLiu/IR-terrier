	<brief_summary>Background : - Enzalutamide well tolerate hormone therapy use treat advanced prostate cancer . It give help kill cancer cell limit cancer cell growth . A new possible way treat prostate cancer use therapeutic cancer vaccine ( immune stimulate therapy ) may help activate immune system cancer . The immune stimulating vaccine help white blood cell recognize kill cancer cell throughout body . This vaccine therapy test hundred patient well tolerate . Researchers want see whether vaccine , give enzalutamide , effective treating advance prostate cancer enzalutamide alone . Objectives : - To compare safety effectiveness enzalutamide without vaccine therapy advance prostate cancer . Key Eligibility : - Men least 18 year age advance castration sensitive prostate cancer . - Patients must testosterone within normal range - No evidence metastatic prostate cancer CT Bone scan - No history autoimmune diseases - No previous immunotherpy within 3 year Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . Imaging study use monitor cancer treatment . - Participants separate two group . One group enzalutamide study vaccine . The group enzalutamide alone . - All participant take enzalutamide day . They take drug 3 month . This form intermittent therapy common population patient . - The vaccine group participant receive new study vaccine . They single injection first day first study cycle . There regular booster injection afterward . There one injection third week treatment , one fifth week . The vaccine give every 4 week 21 week pass . - Treatment monitor frequent blood test image study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enzalutamide Combination With PSA-TRICOM Patients With Non-Metastatic Castration Sensitive Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : - Androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) surveillance standard therapy option prostate cancer patient biochemical progression localize therapy ( nonmetastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer ; nmCSPC also know D0 Prostate Cancer ) . These patient cure prostate cancer primary therapeutic goal contain disease anti-androgen therapy . - ADT administer intermittently consist multiple short course continuously similar long-term clinical outcome . - Previous study high dose bicalutamide ( androgen receptor antagonist , ARA ) show significant biochemical control nmCSPC . - Enzalutamide modern ARA great androgen receptor affinity bicalutamide impairs downstream effect androgen receptor activation . This agent FDA approve treatment chemotherapy refractory metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer . - Given favorable side effect profile , strong interest use enzalutamide treat patient earlier stage prostate cancer include nmCSPC . - PSA-TRICOM ( Prostvac ; develop National Cancer Institute [ NCI ] license Bavarian Nordic , Mountain View , CA ) novel candidate prostate cancer immunotherapy treatment prostate cancer . It viral vector base therapeutic cancer vaccine administer via subcutaneous injection . In randomized control Phase 2 trial , PSA-TRICOM therapy associate prolongation survival men metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer . A phase III trial currently enrol patient population . - There also rationale use therapeutic cancer vaccine PSA-TRICOM earlier stage prostate cancer patient maximize potential therapeutic effect immune stimulate therapy . - An ongoing NCI clinical trial combine PSA-TRICOM flutamide ( old FDA approve ARA ) nonmetastatic castration resistant prostate cancer demonstrate safety suggest potential improve time progression . - Analysis previous trial use therapeutic cancer vaccine alone combination suggest therapy may alter tumor growth rate . If hypothesis correct , therapeutic cancer vaccine may alter tumor regrowth rate/recovery cytoreductive therapy enzalutamide discontinue . - If PSA-TRICOM enzalutamide result reduce tumor regrowth rate measure PSA short course enzalutamide therapy , would provide important proof concept potentially define clear role therapeutic cancer vaccine prostate cancer potentially cancer . - To prospectively evaluate hypothesis , patient treat enzalutamidein manner similar short course ADT use common clinical practice . Half patient also give PSA-TRICOM PSA recovery enzalutamide therapy compare patient receive vaccine . - Preliminary data first cohort randomized patient suggest enzalutamide alone induce immunologic response . A second cohort 15 patient explore low dose enzalutamide 80 mg determine similar immunologic response also see low dose , toxicity less likely . Objectives : Primary Endpoint : -Determine PSA-TRICOM combine novel androgen receptor antagonist enzalutamide result decrease PSA growth kinestics ( tumor re-growth rate ) enzalutamide discontinuation patient non-metastatic , castration sensitive prostate cancer ( i.e . patient normal testosterone ) . Eligibility : - Patients nonmetastatic castration sensitive prostate cancer PSA 2.0 ng/ml - Patients normal testosterone level . - Histologically confirm adenocarcinoma . - Patients PSA double time 12 month less . - ECOG 0-1 . Design : - Randomized pilot study - Cohort 1 : - Thirty-four patient enrol randomized 1:1 - Arm A : Enzalutamide 3 month . - Arm B : Enzalutamide 3 month + PSA-TRICOM week 1 , 3,5,9,13,17 21 . - Cohort 2 : - Fifteen patient enrol evaluate immune response lower dose enzalutamide - Enzalutamide 80 mg 3 month - No patient enrol Cohort 2 close accrual . Cohort 1 : - Arm A : Enzalutamide ( n=17 ) - Arm B : Enzalutamide + PSA-TRICOM ( n=17 ) - Enzalutamide give standard dose 160 mg daily 3 month . PSATRICOM ( Prostvac-V/F ) consist single subcutaneous ( sc ) immunization Prostvac-V Week 1 , follow 6 Prostvac-F immunization administer Weeks 3 , 5 , 9 , 13 , 17 , 21 . Patients retreat 3-month course enzalutamide PSA return baseline value study entry high . Patients study least 7 month long order retreat additional course enzalutamide therapy . Patients follow PSA recovery enzalutamide discontinue . Patients develop 25 % decline PSA 3 month evaluate tumor re-growth additional patient enrol evaluate endpoint . Patients stratify base double time great less 6 month . Cohort 2 ( closed accrual ) -Enzalutamide daily dose 80mg 3 month ( n=15 ) evaluate immune response exploratory fashion . Patients cohort eligible retreatment 2nd course enzalutamide</detailed_description>
