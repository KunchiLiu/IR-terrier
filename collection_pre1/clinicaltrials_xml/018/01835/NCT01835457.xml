	<brief_summary>Auto-immune disease characterize inappropriate inflammatory response tissue body represent major health care burden . Pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α , IL-6 IL-1β play central role pathophysiology many auto-immune disease . Innovative therapy aim limit pro-inflammatory cytokine production physiological manner warrant . In previous research conduct individual know `` iceman '' , investigator find , autodidact concentration/meditation technique , appear mount control stress response , characterize activation sympathetic nervous system enhance production cortisol , know result immunosuppression . In accordance , practice concentration/meditation technique , inflammatory response human endotoxemia ( lipopolysaccharide [ LPS ] administration ) remarkably low individual . Therefore , technique could provide novel mean control inflammatory response . However , aforementioned result obtain one subject , hence serve scientific evidence effectiveness concentration/meditation technique . The iceman claim teach technique subject within relatively short time frame . Therefore , present study investigator wish investigate effect concentration/meditation autonomic nervous system activity inflammatory response experimental human endotoxemia control manner , compare group subject train `` iceman '' practice concentration/meditation technique group subject .</brief_summary>
