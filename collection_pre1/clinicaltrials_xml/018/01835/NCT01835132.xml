	<brief_summary>Background : - Scleritis inflammation white outer coat eye , know sclera . In severe case , cause blindness . It commonly associate autoimmune disorder rheumatoid arthritis . Mild scleritis treat drug ibuprofen . More severe scleritis may need oral steroid immunosuppressive treatment ; however , treatment cause side effect whole body . Gevokizumab new anti-inflammatory drug investigation treat inflammatory disease . It may severe side effect drug . However , yet use treat scleritis . Researchers want see give safe effective treatment scleritis . Objectives : - To see gevokizumab safe effective treatment scleritis . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age active scleritis . Design : - There initial phase two-part extension phase study . The extension phase optional . The initial phase study require seven visit National Eye Institute ( NEI ) . - Participants screen physical exam eye exam , medical history obtain . Blood urine sample collect . - Eligible participant receive injection 60 mg gevokizumab first study visit Weeks 4 , 8 , 12 . They give skin stomach , upper arm thigh . - Participants additional visit first study visit Weeks 2 , 16 , 28 . No injection give visit . Eye exams do , blood tear sample collect . - If scleritis improve Week 16 , participant may choose continue study extension phase . In 1st extension , visit every 4 week Week 36 two additional monitoring visit Weeks 40 52 total 13 study visit . - Participants eligible Week 52 may continue `` need '' ( PRN ) extension phase ( 2nd extension ) receive gevokizumab injection ( 60 mg ) Weeks 52 , 54 , 58 62 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Scleritis chronic , painful potentially blind inflammatory disease characterize edema episcleral sclera tissue commonly associate systemic autoimmune disorder . Gevokizumab interleukin-1β ( IL-1β ) inhibitor , thus possibly prevent IL-1β may responsible scleral breakdown patient anterior scleritis . The study objective evaluate safety potential efficacy gevokizumab possible treatment non-infectious , active , anterior scleritis . Study Population : Ten participant non-infectious , active , anterior scleritis scleral inflammatory grade ≥ +1 least one eye initially enrol . However , eight participant enrol . Participants may ≤ 20 mg/day prednisone equivalent time enrollment immunosuppressive drug stop initiation study drug . Design : This Phase 1/2 , open label , non-randomized , prospective , single-arm , pilot trial evaluate safety potential efficacy gevokizumab non-infectious , active , anterior scleritis . The study consist initial phase follow two-part extension phase . For initial phase , participant receive one subcutaneous injection 60 mg gevokizumab Baseline Weeks 4 , 8 12 . At Week 16 initial phase , participant assess eligibility first extension phase study . Participants initial phase , continue first extension phase study discontinue study drug may receive salvage therapy use standard-of-care treatment investigator 's discretion . Participants initial phase continue first extension phase return final safety visit Week 28 . Participants initial phase determine eligible first extension phase may continue first extension phase receive one gevokizumab injection ( 60 mg ) every four week Week 36 visit . Participants enter first extension phase follow-up safety visit Weeks 40 52 . At Week 52 follow-up first extension phase , participant assess eligibility 2nd extension phase , PRN extension phase study . Participants eligible may continue PRN extension phase ( 2nd extension ) receive gevokizumab injection ( 60 mg ) Weeks 52 , 54 , 58 , 62 . Subjects already complete week 52 visit eligible return assess entry 2nd extension phase . If already complete Week 52 exit visit protocol return enroll PRN extension phase ( 2nd extension ) , visit label Weeks 52 ( PRN-week0 ) , 54 ( PRN-week2 ) , 58 ( PRN-week6 ) , 62 ( PRN-week10 ) . Participants PRN extension phase ( 2nd extension ) final safety visit least 16 week follow last injection PRN extension phase ( 2nd extension ) . Outcome Measures : The primary outcome number participant least 2-step reduction reduction grade 0 scleral inflammation study eye ( eye , eye meet study eye criterion ) , accord standardized photographic scleritis grade system develop NEI , Week 16 visit compare Baseline . Secondary outcome include change visual acuity , change intraocular pressure change scleral grading . Safety outcomes include number severity systemic ocular toxicity adverse event ( AEs ) , proportion participant loss ≥ 15 ETDRS letter follow-up visit .</detailed_description>
