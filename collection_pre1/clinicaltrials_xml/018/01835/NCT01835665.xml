	<brief_title>Dose Finding Study Nimodipine Treatment Progranulin Insufficiency From GRN Gene Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>8 people GRN gene mutation give escalate dos oral nimodipine four week , follow maximally tolerate dose four week . To maximize enrollment , trial enroll symptomatic asymptomatic GRN mutation carrier . The trial include four week , dose-escalation phase follow 1-month maintenance phase , 1-week taper . Assessments study site take place prior start nimodipine , week dose increase ( week 1-5 ) , 4 week maintenance dose , 2 week completion study . These include blood chemistry test , ECGs , blood pressure . Both dose escalation maintenance focus safety tolerability nimodipine treatment population well plasma progranulin level biomarker outcome . The trial incorporate variety fluid biomarker ( blood CSF ) image assessment determine sensitive nimodipine pharmacodynamic effect population .</detailed_description>
