	<brief_summary>This study recruit patient recently submacular haemorrhage ( bleed part retina responsible detailed vision ) , complication wet age-related macular degeneration ( wet AMD ) . Wet AMD common disease abnormal blood vessel form retina leak , cause significant reduction vision . The study investigate treatment bleed various combination two drug : tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) - design dissolve blood clot ; perfluoropropane ( C3F8 ) - design shift blood clot away central part retina ( macula ) . tPA commonly use 'clot-buster ' drug treatment stroke . C3F8 gas commonly use eye surgery . Patients recruit divided four group : control group receive none drug ; one group receive tPA ; one group receive C3F8 ; one group receive . All patient receive current gold standard treatment wet AMD , ranibizumab ( Lucentis® ) . The aim study improve vision condition , leave untreated , would cause severe visual loss .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intravitreal tPA C3F8 Treatment Submacular Haemorrhage Complication Neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) common cause blindness worldwide . Its prevalence increase age , relatively rare 60 year reach peak incidence old 80 year . AMD principally affect central vision , responsible ability see fine detail disease rapidly destroy ability read normal print , recognise face , drive , watch television . It therefore profound effect quality life . There two main form AMD ; dry form , slow degeneration cell responsible sight , result gradual visual loss ; wet form ( neovascular ) , occur abnormal blood vessel ( choroidal neovascularisation ) grow retina , part eye responsible sense light , like film camera . These new blood vessel weak wall lead leakage fluid ( oedema ) , sometimes significant amount bleed ( submacular haemorrhage - SMH ) . These rapidly lead central visual distortion blurring . Although dry form commoner , wet form commonly result profound central visual loss responsible majority case ultimately require blind registration . The current best treatment ( 'gold-standard ' ) wet AMD drug ranibizumab ( Lucentis® ) , aim shrink destroy abnormal blood vessel responsible visual symptom . In several trial ranibizumab show improve vision patient wet AMD . It uncommon patient wet AMD develop SMH , occur , significantly reduce patient 's visual prognosis . SMH think number toxic consequence retinal function . This study investigate use two drug : tissue plasminogen activator ( tPA ) , 'clot-buster ' drug use treat stroke , design dissolve clot central retina ( macula ) ; perfluoropropane ( C3F8 ) , gas commonly use retinal surgery , design displace clot away macula . This study randomize , double-masked , clinical trial recruitment target 55 people SMH wet AMD . Participants allocate one four group ; control group receive none drug ; one group receive tPA ; one group receive C3F8 ; one group receive . All patient receive 'gold-standard ' treatment ranibizumab underlie wet AMD . We aim determine tPA and/or C3F8 produce visual outcome superior standard care , favourable safety profile . We also measure size blood clot scar use computer analysis macula photograph .</detailed_description>
