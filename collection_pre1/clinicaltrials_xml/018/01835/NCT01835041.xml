	<brief_title>CPI-613 Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) CPI-613 ( 6,8-bis [ benzylthio ] octanoic acid ) , use combination modify leucovorin calcium , fluorouracil , irinotecan hydrochloride , oxaliplatin ( mFOLFIRINOX ) , patient metastatic pancreatic cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety CPI-613/mFOLFIRINOX combination patient metastatic pancreatic cancer . II . To collect tissue future genomic analysis . III . To obtain preliminary data efficacy treatment CPI-613/mFOLFIRINOX . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study 6,8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid . Patients receive 6,8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour day 1 3 . Patients also receive oxaliplatin IV 2 hour , leucovorin calcium IV 2 hour , irinotecan hydrochloride IV 90 minute , fluorouracil IV continuously 46 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 2 week 6 month absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
