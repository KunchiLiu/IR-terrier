Nor data compare investigator global assessment acne patient-reported Likert scale acne severity . Magin et al look 108 patient , 41 acne assess difference clinician evaluation acne severity ( use Leeds method indicator severity ) compare patient assessment acne . They find moderately poor agreement objective clinician assessment patient self-assessment acne severity ( weighted kappa 0.35 , 95 % CI 0.1981 - 0.5084 ) . There study well show patient acne often underestimate severity acne .

Results Likert-type scale analyze four group : 0 = none , 1-3 = mild , 4-6 = moderate , 7-9 = severe . No correlation find physician GAGS score patient ' assessment . Smidt et al develop validate quality life index adolescent skin disease , use adult-oriented Skindex Skindex-16 instrument model . Skindex-Teen 21-item questionnaire , self-administered patient generally able complete 5 10 minute . The instrument inquire patient 's perception his/her primary skin condition previous 4 week . Standardized response consist 4-category choice relate frequency 0 never 4 time . Analysis demonstrate refined Skindex-Teen valid effective way measure effect skin disease adolescent . A Likert scale type psychometric scale frequently use psychology questionnaire . On questionnaire , Likert scale ask subject circle , check mark number closely correlate feeling scale . We speculate parent teenager underestimate much acne vulgaris affect teenager 's skin disease-related quality life .
