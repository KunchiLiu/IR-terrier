	<brief_title>Tivozanib Treating Patients With Liver Cancer That Is Metastatic Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Progression free survival ( PFS ) 24 week patient advance hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tivozanib HCC . II . To determine overall survival ( OS ) clinical benefit rate ( complete response [ CR ] , partial response [ PR ] stable disease [ SD ] ) Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) . III . To determine steady state pharmacokinetics ( PK ) soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 ( VEGFR-2 ) baseline/change tivozanib use model correlate exposure biomarker change primary outcome measure PFS . IV . To determine change viral load ( hepatitis B virus [ HBV ] hepatitis C virus [ HCV ] ) therapy patient HBV HCV associate HCC . V. To determine change tumor marker ( alfa fetoprotein ) tivozanib therapy effect tivozanib several tumor-associated immune response marker . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study follow phase II study . Patients receive tivozanib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month .</detailed_description>
