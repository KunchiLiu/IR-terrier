	<detailed_description>Specific gene mutation become target specific therapy . For example lung adenocarcinoma EGFR ( epidermal growth factor receptor ) mutation target EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor achieve strike durable response improve survival . Another example identification echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4/anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) gene fusion lead significant therapeutic gain small percentage patient lung adenocarcinoma whose cancer exhibit mutation . Specific mutation find colon cancer specific drug target gene alteration development . As future therapeutic protocol specific mutation develop , patient agree may notify eligibility study . The aim study link mutational analysis clinical outcome . It recommend patient receive 8 cycle mFOLFOX6 ( modify FOLFOX ) 50.4 Gy radiation concurrent fluoropyrimidine .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically prove adenocarcinoma rectum evidence distant metastasis . The tumor must clinically Stage II ( T34 N0 ) III ( T14 N12 ) . Patients must evidence distant metastasis include liver metastasis , peritoneal seeding , inguinal lymphadenopathy . Patients complete actively enrol CONTRE study patient undergo treatment rectal cancer follow TNT ( Total Neoadjuvant Treatment ) format ( see ) sufficient tissue available require research analysis may enrol study retroactively . For yet receive treatment rectal adenocarcinoma , patient must receive prior chemotherapy pelvic radiation rectal cancer , prior pelvic radiation malignancy would prevent patient receiving require radiation treatment study . Patients must active concurrent invasive malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer . Patients malignancy diagnose within 5 year prior randomization effectively treat deem low risk recurrence eligible . Patients must &gt; 18 year age , ECOG ( performance status ) 01 . ANC ( absolute neutrophil count ) &gt; 1,500/µl , platelet &gt; 100,000/µl , total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 mg/dl direct bilirubin &lt; 1.0 mg/dl , alkaline phosphatase &lt; 3xULN , ALT &lt; 3xULN , creatinine &lt; 1.5xULN . Signed informed consent ; able comply study and/or follow procedure Peripheral neuropathy &lt; grade 1 . The intention treat physician administer Total Neoadjuvant Treatment per suggest treatment guideline section 4 section 5 per standard institutional policy . Evidence metastatic disease . Rectal cancer adenocarcinoma , i.e. , sarcoma , lymphoma , carcinoid , squamous cell carcinoma , cloacogenic carcinoma , etc . Pregnancy lactation time propose randomization . Eligible patient reproductive potential ( sex ) must agree use adequate contraception . Synchronous invasive colon cancer . Nonmalignant systemic disease ( cardiovascular , renal , hepatic , etc . ) would preclude patient receive chemotherapy treatment option would prevent require followup . Patients active inflammatory bowel disease , abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intraabdominal abscess within 6 month prior Day 0 serious medical illness might limit ability patient receive protocol therapy . Known hypersensitivity 5fluorouracil oxaliplatin Psychiatric addictive disorder condition , opinion investigator , would preclude patient meeting study requirement . Insufficient tumor tissue available require genomic analysis patient unable unwilling undergo repeat examination biopsy .</criteria>
