	<criteria>1 . Patients locally advance BCC head neck , consist least one histologically cytologically confirm lesion great equal 20 mm long diameter consider inoperable medical contraindication surgery , opinion Mohs dermatologic surgeon , head neck surgeon , plastic surgeon . Locally advanced disease consider include involve lymph node neck . A patient regionally involved lymph node neck consider eligible . The patient consider candidate radiotherapy medical contraindication receipt radiation therapy . If patient distant metastatic spread BCC ( e.g. , spread distant area outside regional lymph node , clearly non contiguous area bone involvement , distant metastasis lung , brain , visceral organ ) , patient consider distant metastasis eligible . Note : All lesion investigator proposes follow target lesion course study must previously histologically confirm BCC . Acceptable contraindication surgery include : BCC recur location two surgical procedure successful curative resection deem unlikely Complete surgical resection possible deem excessively morbid ( e.g . invasion cranial nerve skull base , proximity brain , spinal canal , orbit ) Anticipated substantial morbidity and/or major deformity surgery ( e.g . removal major facial structure , nose , ear , eyelid , eye , jaw ; requirement upper limb amputation ) Medical contraindication surgery Patient refusal surgery due anticipate morbidity Other condition consider contraindicate must discuss Data Coordinator enrol patient . 2 . Prior radiation therapy acceptable major overlap previously irradiate tissue new radiation treatment volume anticipate delivered purpose protocol , way curative intent radiation meet . Furthermore , total dose radiation deliver expect delivered exceed suggest dose constraint give normal structure . 3 . Zubrod Performance Status 02 4 . Age great equal 18 year 5 . Adequate bone marrow organ function define follow : Adequate bone marrow function : leukocyte : &gt; 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count : great equal 1000 cells/mm3 platelet : great equal 75,000 cells/mm3 hemoglobin : great equal 8.5 g/dl ( recommend cutoff subject judgment medical oncologist ) , transfusion dependent Adequate hepatic function : total bilirubin : le equal 1.5x institutional ULN within 3x ULN patient Gilbert disease AST ( SGOT ) : &lt; 3 X institutional upper limit normal ALT ( SGPT ) : &lt; 3 X institutional upper limit normal Adequate renal function : creatinine : within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance : &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal 6 . Agreement donate blood blood product study 7 month discontinuation vismodegib ; male patient , agreement donate sperm study 7 month discontinuation vismodegib . 7 . For male patient , agreement donate sperm study 3 month final dose vismodegib . Male patient must use condom time , even vasectomy , sexual intercourse pregnant partner female partner reproductive potential treatment vismodegib . Vismodegib present semen . It known amount vismodegib semen cause embryofetal harm . 8 . Verify pregnancy status female reproductive potential within 7 day prior initiate vismodegib . For woman childbearing potential , negative pregnancy test within 7 day prior commencement dosing require . Women reproductive potential require use two form acceptable contraception ( include one acceptable barrier method spermicide ) therapy 7 month complete therapy . Acceptable form primary contraception include follow : Combination hormonal contraceptive , subcutaneous hormonal implant , hormonal patch , hormonal contraceptive ( levonorgestrereleasing intrauterine system , medroxyprogesterone acetate depot ) , tubal sterilization , vasectomy , intrauterine device ( IUD ) . Acceptable form barrier contraception include follow : male condom ( spermicide ) diaphragm ( spermicide ) . 1 . Patients distant metastasis ( e.g . spread distant area outside regional lymph node , clearly non contiguous area bone involvement , distant metastasis lung , brain , liver visceral organ ) ineligible . 2 . Patients nevoid BCC syndrome ( Gorlin syndrome ) enroll study . 3 . A patient know malignancy eligible negligible risk disease progression death within one year , active ongoing treatment malignancy , malignancy and/or anticipated future treatment would interfere protocolmandated evaluation 1 year . 4 . Prior vismodegib antagonist Hh pathway ; 5 . Concurrent nonprotocolspecified antitumor therapy ( e.g. , chemotherapy , target therapy , topical therapy 5Fluorouracil imiquimod , radiation therapy , surgery , photodynamic therapy . For patient multiple cutaneous BCCs baseline designate investigator target lesion , treatment nontarget BCCs surgery may permit must discuss Data Coordinator prior surgical procedure . 6 . Recent ( within 4 week Registration ) , current , planned participation another experimental drug study . 7 . Prior radiotherapy region study cancer would result overlap radiation therapy field way curative intent radiation meet 8 . Inability unwillingness swallow capsule ; Patients condition may impair ability swallow absorb oral medications/investigational product include : lesion , whether induced tumor , radiation condition , make difficult swallow capsule pill ; prior surgical procedure affect absorption include , limited major resection stomach small bowel ; active peptic ulcer disease ; malabsorption syndrome 9 . Pregnant lactating woman . Patients unable unwilling adhere require contraceptive method exclude study . Women reproductive potential require use two form acceptable contraception ( include one acceptable barrier method spermicide ) therapy 7 month complete therapy . Acceptable form primary contraception include follow : Combination hormonal contraceptive , subcutaneous hormonal implant , hormonal patch , hormonal contraceptive ( levonorgestrereleasing intrauterine system , medroxyprogesterone acetate depot ) , tubal sterilisation , vasectomy intrauterine device ( IUD ) . Acceptable form barrier contraception include follow : Any male condom ( spermicide ) diaphragm ( spermicide ) . Male patient must use condom time , even vasectomy , sexual intercourse female partner reproductive potential treatment vismodegib 2 month last dose avoid expose pregnant partner unborn fetus vismodegib . 10 . Life expectancy &lt; 1 year 11 . Patients widespread superficial multifocal BCC consider unresectable due breadth involvement single definable area disease amenable radiation therapy target . Note : If area include one lesion definable radiation therapy targeting , patient may eligible treatment study use designate target lesion ( ) identify investigator . 12 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement ; 13 . History disease , metabolic dysfunction , physical examination finding , clinical laboratory find give reasonable suspicion disease condition contraindicate use investigational drug might affect interpretation result study render patient high risk form treatment complication 14 . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy , potential pharmacokinetic interaction vismodegib ;</criteria>
