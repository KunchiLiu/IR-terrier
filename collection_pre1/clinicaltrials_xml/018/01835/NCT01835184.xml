	<brief_title>Cabozantinib-S-Malate Vemurafenib Treating Patients With Solid Tumors Melanoma That Metastatic That Can Be Removed By Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine tolerable dose XL184 ( cabozantinib-s-malate ) combination vemurafenib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine objective response rate ( ORR ) disease control rate ( DCR ) per Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) version 1.1 . II . To determine progression-free survival ( PFS ) . III . To determine response rate accord molecular phenotype . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study cabozantinib-s-malate . Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) vemurafenib PO twice daily ( BID ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
