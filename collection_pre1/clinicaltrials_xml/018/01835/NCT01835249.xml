	<brief_summary>Hypertension major risk factor cardiovascular renal disease , lead cause premature mortality worldwide . Early hypertension study show treat elevate blood pressure ( BP ) reduce patient ' risk cardiovascular disease all-cause mortality . In subsequent research , patient achieve great improvement cardiovascular outcome treatment aim moderate systolic BP target ( &lt; 150mmHg ) high target . Although observational data suggest even low BP target may beneficial , see randomized trial ; instead , `` intense '' treatment hypertension ( i.e. , target systolic BP &lt; 120mmHg ) find effect participant ' risk renal disease , cardiovascular disease , all-cause mortality . One potential explanation apparent lack benefit intense BP target study protocol target reduction clinic BP rather ambulatory BP . Ambulatory BP monitoring ( ABPM ) allow assessment BP throughout day night . Of BP measurement , nighttime systolic BP appear best predictor cardiovascular disease all-cause mortality . Because recent trial assess intense BP target include ambulatory BP measurement , effect intensive treatment nighttime BP largely unknown . To address important gap knowledge , conduct ABPM 600 participant part ancillary study ongoing Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial ( SPRINT ) . The goal ancillary study evaluate effect intensive vs. standard clinic base BP target nighttime BP ( primary outcome ) , well night/day BP ratio , time peak BP , 24hr BP , BP variability ( secondary outcome ) . The SPRINT trial include approximately 9250 participant high risk cardiovascular disease . The investigator hypothesize intense target clinic systolic BP low nighttime systolic BP compare standard target .</brief_summary>
