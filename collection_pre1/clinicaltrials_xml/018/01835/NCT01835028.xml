	<detailed_description>Low-flow , low-gradient ( LF-LG ) aortic stenosis ( AS ) may occur depressed ( i.e . Classical LF ; CLF ) preserve ( i.e . Paradoxical LF ; PLF ) LV ejection fraction ( LVEF ) situation amongst challenge encounter patient valvular heart disease . Although , CLF-LG AS recognize important clinical entity , current ACC/AHA-ESC guideline however provide precise recommendation clinical management patient important lack data condition . PLF-LG AS new entity recently describe group , characterize pronounced LV concentric remodel small LV cavity size restrictive physiology lead impaired LV filling , alter myocardial function , low-flow state . Up recently , entity often misdiagnosed , lead underestimation AS severity inappropriate delay aortic valve replacement surgery ( SAVR ) . The two main challenge patient CLF- PLF- LG AS distinguish true-severe ( TS ) versus pseudo-severe ( PS ) stenosis accurately quantify extent myocardial impairment . Unfortunately , traditional resting stress echocardiographic parameter currently use assess severity valvular myocardial dysfunction patient LF-LG AS far optimal , consequence , quantification disease severity therapeutic management may appropriate substantial proportion patient . Furthermore , remain uncertain optimal timing mode treatment ( SAVR vs. Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation [ TAVI ] vs. Medical ) different subset patient LF-LG AS patient ( CLF- vs. PLF- LG AS ; TS vs. PS AS ; absence vs. presence myocardial contractile reserve etc . ) THE GENERAL OBJECTIVES TOPAS study develop validate new parameter biomarkers improve assessment stenosis severity myocardial impairment , risk-stratification , clinical decision make patient LF-LG AS ass impact different therapeutic strategy patient outcomes . THE SPECIFIC AIMS phase III TOPAS study : ( 1 ) To obtain analyze parameter stenosis severity LV functional impairment measure stress echocardiography ( SE ) , degree valvular calcification measure multidetector compute tomography ( CT ) , extent myocardial fibrosis measure magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , blood level natriuretic peptide marker extracellular matrix ( ECM ) turn-over , occurrence clinical event series 310 patient CLF-LG AS ( 210 TOPAS- I II + 100 TOPAS-III ) series 380 patient PLF-LG AS ( 80 TOPAS II + 300 TOPAS-III ) . ( 2 ) To measure weight calcification valve explanted patient undergo SAVR follow-up order corroborate actual severity stenosis . ( 3 ) To assess usefulness : ) project aortic valve area measure SE separate TS PS AS predict outcomes PLF-LG AS ; ii ) amount valvular calcium measure CT separate TS PS AS predict outcomes CLF- PLF- LG AS ; iii ) myocardial contractile reserve measure SE , extent myocardial fibrosis measure MRI , plasma level BNP ECM biomarkers predict operative ( SAVR ) / procedural ( TAVI ) risk well hemodynamic ( LV function ) , functional ( DASI 6-min walk test distance ) , clinical ( morbidity-mortality ) outcomes CLF- PLF- LG AS . ( 4 ) To compare different mode treatment ( SAVR , TAVI , Medical ) , respect hemodynamic , functional , clinical outcome . RELEVANCE OF THE STUDY : There prospective study perform patient LF-LG AS study include relatively small number patient , often use one imaging modality ( Doppler-echo ) limit number biomarkers , generally include patient PLF-LG AS . Our prospective study first kind , use complementary multimodality image approach measure prospectively conventional parameter disease severity well new emerge parameter biomarkers develop team large prospective series patient CLF- PLF- LG AS . This study shall contribute improve diagnostic evaluation clinical conduct patient LF-LG AS . This new knowledge lead establishment clinical guideline management high-risk patient .</detailed_description>
