	<detailed_description>Protocol Title : The Reliability Validity Timed Stair Climbing Test ( TSCT ) Outcome Measure Individuals Pulmonary Disease . Background An important part pulmonary rehabilitation ability document progress . Commonly use outcome measure include walk test like Six Minute Walk Test ( 6MWT ) Shuttle Walk Test , MET level questionnaire . A recent study Annegarn1 et al. , analyzed response 820 Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) patient . While 35 % respondent cite stair climb problematic Activity Daily Living ( ADL ) , study look stair climb ability outcome measure . Step test use riser metronome long use fitness measure healthy subject challenge administer non healthy population mimic challenge actually mount series step . Many exist stair climb study use actual stair test distance base examine stair climb predictor outcome follow lung surgery . One study conduct Randolph2 et al. , attempt compare stair climb ability Pulmonary Function Tests ( PFTs ) predictor post-thoracotomy outcome . Brunelli3 et al. , look stair climb useful predictor cardiopulmonary complication follow lung resection . Both study conclude stair climb test clinically useful . Bean4 develop stair climb test call Stair Climb Power Test incorporate element time ask subject climb staircase ten stairs quickly safely possible look relationship muscle strength functional performance . The Six Minute Walk Test well establish valid reliable outcome measure population5 . A study Dreher6 et al. , 2008 attempt compare stair climb test Six Minute Walk Test . Using randomized cross-over design , look sixteen COPD patient find pathophysiological change six minute walk test anticipate change find stair climb patient severe COPD . All point fact time stair climb test potential serve unique valuable outcome measure patient respiratory compromise . It well understand many people pulmonary disease , especially live urban area , unavoidably encounter stair . While six minute walk test require minimum long straight hallway hard surface administration7 even always readily available . The Timed Stair Climbing Test could provide outcome measure easily administer could utilize outpatient inpatient setting well home environment . Questions Addressed Is Timed Stair Climbing Test reliable valid measure use ass endurance individual pulmonary disease compare 6MWT ? Research Design Methodological Research design establish validity reliability Timed Stair Climbing Test use . Test score 6MWT TSCT compare , use patient document pulmonary disease participate pulmonary rehabilitation . All test take place premise The Alice Lawrence Center Health Rehabilitation locate third floor Linsky Building , Petrie Campus Beth Israel Medical Center First Ave 16th Street New York City . Screening subject test administration conduct investigator limited staff member license Physical Therapists Exercise Physiologists ACLS certification operate supervision Dr. Jonathan Raskin , MD , director center . Administration 6MWT currently part usual standard care pulmonary rehabilitation patient attend center . It perform twice , one evaluation later towards end person 's series session . American Thoracic Society guideline administer 6MWT follow . The Timed Stair Climbing Test add subject 's initial evaluation discharge session research purpose . For TSCT patient supervise ascend descend flight 10 step 7 inch riser 30 second timed stop watch . Number step achieve , oxygen saturation , rate perceive exertion , dyspnea , heart rate use non-use hand rail record . Vital sign continuously monitor . As 6MWT , subject allow use supplemental oxygen prescribe . Whether test perform room air supplemental oxygen record test result . Oxygen delivery system level oxygen flow equipment manage also record test result . Subjects option rely assistive device accustom use non use cane , handrail , orthoses etc record . Subjects deem fit attempt stair climb task investigator apparent distress , rest heart rate 50 120 , rest blood pressure 90/50 150/90 complaint pain dyspnea great 2/10 rest oxygen saturation level great 90 % rest measure pulse oximeter . The test terminate 30 second event complaint pain dyspnea great 4/10 , increase heart rate great 40 beat rest decrease oxygen saturation 86 % time request patient . Inclusion Criteria : This study include patient documented pulmonary disease underwent course pulmonary rehabilitation The Alice Lawrence Center Health Rehabilitation consist 10 session . Exclusion Criteria : The follow exclude study : 1 . Patients unable perform follow-up 6MWT TSCT lose follow-up . 2 . Patients orthopedic neurological condition ( significant limitation ambulation stair climb ) limit participation pulmonary rehabilitation . Data Analysis Pearson-Product Moment Correlation Coefficient Spearman Rho Convergent Validity use compare 6MWT TSCT result . Intra-class Correlation Coefficient Intra-rater , Inter-rater , Test-retest Reliability also compute . Dr. David Lucido consult expertise biostatistician . He suggest 30 60 participant would adequate sample size purpose study . Significance This study would help determine Timed Stair Climbing Test useful outcome measure people pulmonary disease .
