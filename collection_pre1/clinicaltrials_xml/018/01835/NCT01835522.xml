Antipsychotic Medication Two major class medication use treat Schizophrenia psychotic disorder , dopamine receptor antagonist ( typical antipsychotic ) serotonin-dopamine antagonist ( atypical antipsychotic ) . While class efficacious , atypicals associate few neurological adverse effect , effective broad range psychotic symptom . Most dopamine receptor antagonist significant effect type receptor , include adrenergic , cholinergic , histaminergic receptor . Effects sexual function mediate primarily result imbalance adrenergic cholinergic activity , decrease catecholamine activity , endocrine effect . Blockade dopamine receptor tuberoinfundibular tract result increase secretion prolactin , result breast enlargement , galactorrhea , impotence men , amenorrhea inhibit orgasm woman .

Hypotheses : 1 . Patients typical antipsychotic rate sexual function lower atypical agent . 2 . Patients multiple antipsychotic rate sexual function lower single agent .</detailed_description>
