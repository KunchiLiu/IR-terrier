	<brief_summary>This study research purpose treat disease condition may . The study open label single dose study ; open label mean , study doctor study staff know study drug take . The purpose research study compare drug level body people liver disease drug level healthy people normal liver . In addition , safety study drug study . Information side effect ( discomfort decline health ) may happen collect . The study drug give mouth subject liver disease healthy subject . In body , drug normally remove liver small amount remove kidney . When liver work well , body may able remove drug body quickly . The information study use decide drug safe subject liver disease lower dose study drug would safer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Pharmacokinetics Pomalidomide Hepatically Impaired Males</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct one clinical site ( 2‐3 clinical research site ) design assess impact severe liver disease hepatic impairment ( Part 1 , Group 1 ) PK pomalidomide follow oral administration single dose 4 mg pomalidomide ( study drug ) . The study drug , pomalidomide ( POMALYST® ) , approve United States Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) treat patient multiple myeloma ( MM ) . Patients MM bone marrow produce large number abnormal cell . Pomalidomide available prescription . Since participant study MM , pomalidomide consider experimental purpose research study . Throughout form , pomalidomide refer `` study drug . '' Participation study either healthy group group liver disease . For group liver disease , liver disease grade study doctor `` severe , '' `` moderate , '' `` mild . '' This do study doctor depend medical history , physical examination , laboratory test , certain previous result liver scan liver biopsy . The amount study drug blood measure certain time well drug broken‐down remove body . Blood sample approximately 1 teaspoon ( approximately 5‐6 mL ) collect 13 time follow time measure study drug level blood : • Predose ( dose ) , 0.25 , 1 , 2 , 2.5 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 30 , 48 hour dose pomalidomide morning dose Day 1 . This study two part : Part 1 evaluate study drug subject severe liver disease ( Group healthy volunteer subject ( Group 1 ) match subject liver disease . Part 2 evaluate study drug subject moderate ( Group 3 ) and/ mild ( Group 4 ) liver disease . Study participation one part ( either Part 1 Part 2 ) . Part conduct data Part 1 analyze review doctor sponsor determine need conduct Part 2 . The purpose study : - To measure compare level pomalidomide blood male subject severe liver disease match healthy volunteer subject take one 4‐mg capsule pomalidomide . - To measure compare level pomalidomide blood male subject moderate mild liver disease take one 4‐mg capsule pomalidomide . - To study impact liver disease safety single dose pomalidomide male subject liver disease . Approximately 16 male subject enrol Part 1 study ( 8 healthy subject 8 subject severe liver disease ) . Approximately 16 male subject Part 2 study ( 8 subject mild liver disease subject moderate liver disease ) . If part study complete , total 32 male subject enrol . The total time participant study 1 month ( screen visit end study ) .</detailed_description>
