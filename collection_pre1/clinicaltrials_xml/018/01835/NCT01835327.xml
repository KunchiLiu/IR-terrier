	<brief_summary>The current study propose address question whether patient ' cerebral oxygen saturation level predictive recovery thoracic surgery . Further , study pose hypothesis patient 's poor recovery status go increase patient 's risk develop post-operative morbidity pneumonia , arrhythmias delirium . The aim study address observation patient struggle others recovery 1 ) may result intraoperative cerebral oxygen desaturations 2 ) may affect post-operative morbidity . If potential mean predict poor outcome identify lead research adjust associate variable , cerebral oxygenation , improve patient post-operative outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite advance field thoracic surgery , post-operative morbidity continue significant problem limit understanding connection insult surgery anesthesia pathophysiology development morbidity . Surgeons thoracic department note patient seem recover less vigorously patient . What account different recovery trajectory unclear . Researchers develop Post-Operative Quality Recovery Scale ( PQRS ) assess six domain ( physiologic , nociceptive , emotive , activity daily live , cognitive , overall patient experience ) suggest serve mean track patient ' recovery surgery .</detailed_description>
