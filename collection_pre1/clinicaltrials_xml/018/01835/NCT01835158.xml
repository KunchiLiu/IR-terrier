	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well cabozantinib-s-malate work compare sunitinib malate treating patient previously untreated kidney cancer spread start nearby tissue lymph node place body . Cabozantinib-s-malate sunitinib malate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether cabozantinib-s-malate effective sunitinib malate treat patient kidney cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cabozantinib-s-malate Sunitinib Malate Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Locally Advanced Metastatic Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine patient renal cancer treat cabozantinib ( cabozantinib-s-malate ) improve progression-free survival compare patient treat sunitinib ( sunitinib malate ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether response rate patient renal cancer treat cabozantinib high compare patient treat sunitinib . II . To determine whether patient renal cancer treat cabozantinib improve overall survival compare patient treat sunitinib . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether renal cancer patient high MET expression immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) improvement progression-free survival compare patient low MET expression arm study . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 6 week . Courses repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive sunitinib malate PO QD 4 week . Courses repeat every 6 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
