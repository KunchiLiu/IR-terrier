	<brief_summary>Functional evaluation coronary lesion , evaluation fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) pressure-wire patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) evaluate randomised trial - FAME trial - show superior classic anatomical evaluation . Based result , current guideline recommend use FFR ( class I-A recommendation ) objective evidence vessel-related ischemia available . Since FAME trial publish , FFR use increase dramatically European country , Portugal exception trend . FFR currently use many interventional cardiology centre quite beyond European Guidelines recommendation , since many physician trust information collect pressure-wire angiography , less non invasive imaging stress test . Considering widespread use FFR evaluation patient CAD , need clarify clinical result approach `` real patient set '' . The Portuguese Study The Evaluation FFR Guided Treatment Coronary Disease ( POST-IT ) plan evaluate use FFR decision coronary revascularization feasible allows optimize clinical result `` real world '' non select patient , show clinical randomised trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Portuguese Study The Evaluation FFR Guided Treatment Coronary Disease ( POST-IT9 national multicentric , prospective , consecutive ( non select ) anonymous observational study patient submit coronary angiography functional evaluation pressure-wire coronary lesion perform . The main purpose registry collect data medical decision clinical result CAD patient evaluate FFR ( use pressure-wireÂ® , St. Jude Medical ) , order provide evidence `` real world '' non select patient . This evidence add already available clinical data randomize trial . All Portuguese interventional cardiology center perform regularly FFR study invite participate study . Data collect time procedure patient clinically followed-up 1 year . Information concern medical history , past exam , angiography , FFR study follow-up collect registry form . The treatment strategy patient decide operator physician , accord best clinical judgment . Changes treatment strategy due FFR result record , intention study collect clinical information , influence physician practice . An informed consent form must sign patient include . Patients free withdraw consent anytime .</detailed_description>
