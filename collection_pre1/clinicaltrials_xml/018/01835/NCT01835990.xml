	<brief_summary>Trauma patient high risk develop blood clot legs ( deep vein thrombosis - DVT ) , travel lung cause serious health consequence . Often , patient receive blood-thinning medication prevent blood clot risk bleed ; case , usually give intermittent pneumatic compression device ( IPCs ) prevent blood clot . IPCs inflatable sleeve fit leg periodically inflate deflate , help pump blood leg thus reduce risk blood clot formation . Several study suggest IPCs work properly patient 60-70 % time . Some patient also find uncomfortable . A new device ( geko ) work stimulate leg muscle increase blood flow legs recently develop . To compare geko IPCs , study randomly assign trauma patient receive blood thinner blood clot prevention either IPCs geko . The main goal determine feasibility large study would compare efficacy device prevent blood clot . The amount time device properly use patient , comfort tolerability , development blood clot , blood flow leg vein artery also measure compare device .</brief_summary>

Glasgow Coma Scale ( GCS ) less equal 10 , result trauma two : significant decrease level consciousness pulse &lt; 50 &gt; 120 BP &lt; 80 absent radial pulse Respiratory rate &lt; 10 &gt; 24 Subject admit Hamilton General Hospital ICU hospital ward stepdown unit Age 18 year old Contraindication anticoagulation expect last 3 day . Contraindication anticoagulation may include intracranial hemorrhage , ocular injury associate hemorrhage , solid intraabdominal organ injury ( i.e . liver , spleen , kidney ) , and/or pelvic retroperitoneal hematoma require transfusion . [ 12 ] The final determination whether anticoagulant prophylaxis contraindicate make treat physician . Projected hospitalization great 3 day ( determined treat physician ) Informed consent provide subject substitute decision maker within 48 hour admission Inability wear either IPCs gekoTM leg , include limited : unstable fracture low extremity ; compartment syndrome lower extremity ; skin breakdown affect area device apply ; prior amputation affect area device apply ; severe peripheral ischemic vascular disease ; uncontrolled bleeding low extremity ; Diagnosis DVT within 1 month prior assessment enrollment Use anticoagulant medication within 24h enrollment ( except use solely flush intravenous catheter ) , ongoing effect anticoagulant medication time enrollment determine history medication use laboratory evidence medication effect . For purpose study , anticoagulant medication include : unfractionated heparin ( intravenous subcutaneous ) low molecular weight heparin fondaparinux dabigatran rivaroxaban warfarin argatroban danaparoid lepirudin Leg circumference great 24 inch location gekoTM device would secure leg .
