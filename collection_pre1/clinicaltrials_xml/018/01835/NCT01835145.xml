	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well cabozantinib-s-malate work compare temozolomide dacarbazine treat patient melanoma eye ( ocular melanoma ) spread part body remove surgery . Cabozantinib-s-malate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide dacarbazine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . It yet know whether cabozantinib-s-malate work well temozolomide dacarbazine treat patient melanoma eye .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cabozantinib-S-Malate Compared With Temozolomide Dacarbazine Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma Eye That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Compare progression-free survival rate 4 month ( PFS4 ) patient ocular melanoma treat cabozantinib-s-malate ( cabozantinib ) temozolomide ( dacarbazine ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate distribution progression-free survival ( PFS ) time . II . Estimate distribution overall survival ( OS ) time . III . Estimate confirm response rate determine Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion . IV . Assess safety agent examine toxicity profile . V. Correlate response MET molecular status . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive temozolomide PO daily day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . If temozolomide available , patient receive dacarbazine intravenously ( IV ) 15-60 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 12 week 2 year .</detailed_description>
