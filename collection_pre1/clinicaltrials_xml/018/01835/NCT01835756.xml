	<brief_title>Study Low Level Laser Therapy Treat Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Back pain common musculoskeletal disorder affect 80 % people point life . It second common neurological ailment United States , second headache , common cause job-related disability lead contributor miss work . Around $ 50 billion spend U.S. year treat low back pain . Men woman equally affect , common age affect 30 50 year . Most low back pain stem benign musculoskeletal problem , refer non-specific low back pain , etiology evaluate study . It cause lumbar sprain strain stretch injury ligament , tendon , and/or muscle low back . Current mainstream treatment approach low back pain due lumbar sprain strain focus reduce pain inflammation , include rest ; oral topical over-the-counter prescription medication ; local heat application ; massage exercise . Alternative treatment option include acupuncture ; chiropractic manipulation ; biofeedback ; traction ; transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) ; ultrasound . Surgical procedure also treatment option low back pain , although outcomes often poor last , back surgery remain 3rd common form surgery United States , 300,000 back surgery perform annually . Low Level Laser Therapy ( LLLT ) communicate information receptor membrane cell mitochondrion ( enzymatic engine cell ) . This energetic information reach cell 's DNA , directly control cell function . When cell receive good information , work well , tissue comprise , like bone , cartilage , tendon , ligament , etc . In way , LLLT promote heal regeneration damage tissue , local effect tissue function also systemic effect carry throughout body blood acupuncture meridian . The key basic physiological effect low level laser light include increase cell membrane polarization permeability ; Adenosine-5-triphosphate ( ATP ) production respiratory chain activity ; enzyme activity ; collagen epithelial production ; capillary formation ; macrophage ( immune ) activity ; analgesic effect due elevate endorphin production , electrolytic nerve blockage , improve blood lymph flow ; anti-inflammatory effect due improve circulation accelerate tissue regeneration ; increase production antioxidant . Of additional benefit light energy low level laser absorb cell tissue function normally effect healthy cell . Therefore , low level laser therapy potential benefit provide effective mean reduce low back pain simple , quick , non-invasive side-effect free .</detailed_description>
