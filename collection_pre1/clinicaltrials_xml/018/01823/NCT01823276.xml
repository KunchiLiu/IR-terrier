	<brief_summary>The objective propose research determine tyrosine , amino acid find protein-containing food , mitigate cognitive deficit adverse effect behavior mood produce exposure military stress . This study conduct Army Survive , Evade , Resist , Escape ( SERE ) school Fort Bragg , NC . Tyrosine dietary precursor catecholamine norepinephrine , key brain neurotransmitter critical central nervous system ( CNS ) response various type acute stress . Psychological stress increase catecholamine turnover brain , increase requirement tyrosine support synthesis norepinephrine . Animal human study show tyrosine supplementation produce beneficial effect cognitive physiological function exposure variety acute stressor . This project determine volunteer treat supplemental tyrosine stressful phase SERE train experience less degradation cognitive performance mood volunteer treat placebo . Tyrosine placebo administer specially develop food bar provide volunteer . The bar part prototype ration-component design use assault operation . A between-subjects , double blind experimental design employ . Tyrosine , amino acid find protein-containing food , test hundred volunteer without adverse effect . Approximately 100 volunteer recruit several SERE class ensure 82 volunteer complete study . They test several portion SERE . A comprehensive brief battery cognitive test , well saliva blood sample , collect manner interfere ongoing training . Hypotheses : 1 . The adverse effect psychological stress cognitive performance mood SERE school reduce volunteer give supplemental tyrosine compare placebo treatment . 2 . Supplemental tyrosine reduce release proinflammatory cytokine may increase stressful activity SERE school .</brief_summary>
