	<brief_summary>Bicuspid Aortic Valve ( BAV ) common congenital heart malformation adult , little know genetic cause risk factor adverse outcome . Currently , estimate case aortic stenosis patient less 65 year old cause BAVs . BAV patient also high risk develop aneurysm ascend aorta , may lead aortic dissection . Dr. Prakash colleague plan use individual genetic information identify person BAV high risk complication customize therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genetic Risks Bicuspid Aortic Valve Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To include study , patient must bicuspid unicuspid aortic valve , document clinical history image study . If aortic valve replace surgically , may still eligible . Participants ask donate single tube blood fill questionnaire . Patients also follow telephone email year determine experience medical complication relate Bicuspid Aortic Valve ( BAV ) , aortic aneurysm , aortic dissection valve disease . Patients may include less 18 year old time recruitment recognize genetic syndrome genetic mutation Marfan Ehlers-Danlos syndrome .</detailed_description>
