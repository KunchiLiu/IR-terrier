	<brief_summary>The purpose study see whether low blood sugar night reduce use system turn insulin pump automatically . The study system include continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) insulin pump . The CGM pump work regular laptop computer . A The system work ( 1 ) measure glucose level skin CGM , ( 2 ) use computer program laptop predict whether low blood sugar likely occur , ( 3 ) turn insulin pump computer program predicts low blood sugar occur . We test system home environment individual type 1 diabetes age 15 year old . We find indication system decrease frequency hypoglycemia . We serious case high blood sugar problem . We ready test system home environment young age group learn ability reduce overnight low blood sugar risk . This study several phase take 3 month patient complete . - First , patient use CGM pump home 15 day help parent/guardian . This do determine patient meet study criterion proceed next phase study . - If patient eligible continue study , patient need use full study system least 5 night home help parent/guardian . This do make sure patient parent/guardian able use system correctly . The patient may participate start stop system home , parent/guardian responsible making sure use instruct . - After , patient ask use study system night additional 6 8 week . The parent/guardian remain responsible make sure system use instruct . The study include 90 individual type 1 diabetes 3 clinical center United States Canada . First study child 8 less 15 year old do . Then , study child 3 less 8 year old conduct .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients eligible clinical trial initially use Veo insulin pump Enlite sensor home verify patient able use continuous glucose monitor ( CGM ) insert sensor eligible continue study . A parent guardian child subject oversee action subject responsible patient 's overall participation propose study , include operation investigational device system . The first 10 patient 8 &lt; 15 year age participate Algorithm Assessment Phase approximately 10 night active system use ( nominal total 100 night use ) determine adjustment algorithm parameter need safe advance randomize clinical trial phase subject . If adjustment need , Algorithm Assessment Phase repeat , use 10 patient possible . Once randomized clinical trial phase begin patient 8 &lt; 15 year age , approximately 200 night randomize system use collect assessed safety patient 3 &lt; 8 year age may enrol study . When enrollment begin patient 3 &lt; 8 year age , second Algorithm Assessment Phase conduct first 10 patient young age group use approach describe old subject . Once randomized clinical trial phase begin patient 3 &lt; 8 year age , final Data Safety Monitoring Board safety assessment perform approximately first 200 night randomize system use . Patients enroll study completion Algorithm Assessment Phase age group use closed-loop system home least 5 day demonstrate ability use system submit study data Coordinating Center . Patients successfully demonstrate ability use system home describe eligible randomized trial phase . This phase consist use full system outpatient approximately 42 night : - Each night blood glucose ( BG ) level check BG meter use perform calibration CGM . This calibration must occur 90 minute prior activation system . NOTE : Subjects instruct calibrate CGM per manufacturer guideline . - Then system activate , link CGM insulin pump computer bedside . - A randomization schedule laptop use determine whether 'pump shut ' application active night . - Patients blind whether pump shut active session initiate night . - There alarm pump shuts . The CGM alarm set 60 mg/dL ( 3.3 mmol/L ) . When CGM alarm occurs , subject ask measure blood glucose BG meter , he/she aware alarm . - Patients ask check blood ketone study ketone meter subject fingerstick BG ≥250 mg/dL ( 13.9 mmol/L ) . - Patients ask check blood glucose study BG meter , blood ketone study ketone meter , urine ketone ketone strip morning prior breakfast enter result use controller software interface . The patient instruct contact study physician blood glucose ketone reading expect range . - Patients ask record overnight carbohydrate intake use controller software interface . - Patients ask perform periodic CGM data uploads use controller software interface . Upon completion study , patient well study clinician ask complete human factor usability questionnaire regard use study system .</detailed_description>
