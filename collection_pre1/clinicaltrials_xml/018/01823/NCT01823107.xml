	<brief_title>Feasibility Study Meso BioMatrix Device Breast Reconstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following mastectomy , woman may elect breast reconstruction autologous tissue breast implant . Two-stage , tissue expander assist breast reconstruction one common surgical method could select reconstruct breast . This method either begin immediately mastectomy ( know immediate breast reconstruction ) time afterward ( know delay breast reconstruction ) . Historically , surgeon place tissue expander follow breast implant either completely partially pectoralis muscle . However , method breast reconstruction associate less favorable aesthetic outcome . Recently , surgeon start add surgical mesh derive human cadaver skin breast reconstruction procedure . In summary , first stage breast reconstruction , plastic surgeon release pectoralis muscle chest wall . The surgeon attach surgical mesh pectoralis muscle chest wall breast . This do create pocket tissue expander . The tissue expander implant pocket partially inflate . The tissue expander gradually fill saline several week month . Once desired breast volume achieve , second stage reconstruction take place . In second stage , tissue expander remove replaced permanent saline silicone gel breast implant . Use human cadaver skin surgical mesh breast reconstruction associate less pain , few tissue expansion visit improve aesthetic outcome . However , human cadaver skin surgical mesh add significant cost procedure surgeon report increased rate post-operative complication . Over last 10 year , number surgical mesh device clear U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration ( FDA ) reinforcement repair weak soft tissue become available tissue graft human donor . Some surgeon publish experience number surgical mesh device breast reconstruction . However , present , surgical mesh device approve cleared FDA use breast reconstruction . The Meso BioMatrix device recently clear FDA reinforcement repair weak soft tissue . It surgical mesh device make pig peritoneum , tissue line abdominal cavity . The tissue thoroughly clean sterilize use . When implanted , Meso BioMatrix device provide structural mechanical support weak soft tissue heal process . This clinical trial feasibility trial . A feasibility trial clinical trial device study small group people new use . Since Meso BioMatrix device clear specifically use breast reconstruction , consider investigational must study control , step-wise series clinical trial . Therefore , result trial , successful , may use design large clinical trial future .</detailed_description>
