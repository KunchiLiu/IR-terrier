	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether treatment ticagrelor + aspirin effective treatment clopidogrel + aspirin patient type-2 diabetes . Both treatment give ( separately ) subject one-time load dose ( i.e . high normal daily dose ) , follow daily dose next 5 7 day . Effectiveness treatment measure specialized blood test load dose , two time-points load dose , last daily dose .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ticagrelor Versus Clopidogrel Type 2 Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The rise prevalence diabetes mellitus associate cardiovascular complication present major burden healthcare provider worldwide . Cardiovascular mortality much high among subject Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( T2DM ) . Increased platelet reactivity consider potential link two disease . Thus , give high blood thrombogenicity T2DM CAD , availability potent antiplatelet drug associate improvement prevention cardiovascular event diabetic population . Ticagrelor show posse faster onset action potency clopidogrel . Furthermore , PLATO show characteristic result significant reduction Cardiovascular event even death compare Clopidogrel . We plan compare antithrombotic activity ticagrelor versus clopidogrel T2DM patient use cross-over study design . Each participant randomly assign receive ticagrelor/clopidogrel + aspirin load dose follow 5-7 day daily maintenance dosing . After washout period 1-2 week , participant receive second treatment ( clopidogrel/ticagrelor + aspirin ) load dose follow 5-7 day daily dose . Platelet function test pre-treatment baseline , two post-dose time-points day load dose , one time-point last maintenance dose day 5-7 . Platelet test carry use follow methodology : 1 . Badimon Perfusion Chamber : ex-vivo model thrombosis extensively utilized evaluation antithrombotic prothrombotic effect various pathological state . The model involve native blood perfuse thrombogenic substrate , trigger thrombus formation measure planimetry . 2 . Platelet Aggregation - Multiplate Analyzer . 3 . Platelet Aggregation - VerifyNow P2Y12 assay . 4 . Vasodilator-Stimulated Phosphoprotein ( VASP ) .</detailed_description>
