	<brief_title>Oxidative Stress Inflammation Caused Intravenous Iron Crohn 's Disease Patients With Iron Deficiency Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anemia one common extra-intestinal manifestation Crohn 's disease ( CD ) prevalence range 6.2 % 73.7 % .Compared complication , subestimated receive less attention gastroenterologist , although , frequently associate reduce quality life.What 's , appropriate strategy adequate treatment anaemia CD either . The anaemia CD cause several factor , iron , folic acid B12 deficiency , treatment immunosuppressive drug sulfasalazine-induced hemolysis , anemia chronic disease , iron deficiency one important mechanism . Additionally , erythropoietin ( EPO ) level chronic disease anemia generally high normal subjects.However , CD anemic patient EPO increase inadequate relation degree anemia.Thus , treatment iron deficiency anemia ( IDA ) CD , EPO iron supplementation common.Because intravenous ( IV ) iron effective well tolerate oral iron consider patient severe anemia ( Hb＜10.0 g/dL ) , intolerance inadequate response oral iron and/or active IBD . Intravenous iron administration route choice simultaneous treatment erythropoiesis stimulat-ing agent ( ESA ) consider . But parenteral iron formulation potential toxic effect trigger oxidative reaction inflammatory reaction may disadvantageous CD patient . Free iron may provoke formation free oxygen radical . Although complex carbohydrate structure cover free iron may alleviate oxidative inflammatory potential , completely block . These suggest parenteral iron could `` double-edged sword '' hematologic beneﬁts ( increase hemoglobin [ Hb ] ) one hand , risk enhancement systemic inﬂammation oxidative stress . Although oxidative potential intravenous iron ( IVI ) study extensively , study effect parenteral iron therapy oxidative stress inflammatory marker CD population . In study , compare different type schedule iron compound effect serum inflammatory-oxidative stress index .</detailed_description>
