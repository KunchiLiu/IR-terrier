	<detailed_description>Despite increase incidence overweight obesity among child , nutritional deficiency still concern . A low intake vitamin mineral associate reduction antioxidant capacity . Some vitamin associate chronic disease include overweight obesity . S-adenosylmethionine ( SAM ) S-adenosylhomocysteine ( SAH ) substrate product essential reaction ; SAM : SAH ratio associate health indicator cellular DNA methylation potential . Low level ratio may affect short long term health . In explorative knowledge building open interventional study , subject enrol child adolescent 9 13 year age per year ( n=180 per year , 2 year ) . The study consist 6 week nutritional intervention follow 6 week follow . In study , genomics , proteomics , lipidomics analysis perform , addition biochemistry , hematology vitamin analysis .</detailed_description>
