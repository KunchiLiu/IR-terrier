	<brief_summary>Our primary objective set Human Rhinovirus ( HRV ) -model centre . In addition , facilitate future clinical trial , want determine optimal read-out parameter read-out time point experimental HRV infection healthy volunteer . Furthermore , want analyze extent HRV cause systemic immune effect , want test subject antibodies HRV re-infected virus , presence HRV antibody influence local clinical immunological response upon infection . Additionally , gain insight immune modulate property HRV , want investigate immunological response HRV re-infection within one week determine mechanism provide immediate protection re-infection . This facilitate cross-over design future pharmacological intervention-trials . Furthermore , want investigate capacity HRV infection modulate systemic immune response analyze response leukocytes ex vivo stimulate different stimulus . Moreover , want evaluate effect HRV-16 infection host transcriptome metabolome . Finally , The influence HRV-16 infection nasal gut microbiota assess .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The importance common cold derives primarily frequency enormous socioeconomic impact . Human Rhinoviruses ( HRVs ) major cause common cold , responsible 30-50 % acute respiratory illness causal remedy hand . A model investigate pathophysiology HRV infection test compound could treat protect one infection develop symptom would therefore valuable . With HRV model also possible investigate crosstalk bacteria virus . This relevant , follow viral infection , bacterial superinfection common clinical practice , underlie mechanism subsequent possible therapy could prevent remain discovered . Worldwide , thousand subject expose experimental rhinovirus infection , 600 HRV-16 . Serious adverse event related rhinovirus infection never document . Therefore , model consider safe highly reproducible model . Moreover , 52 volunteer already expose HRV-16 virus batch want use study . Healthy volunteer meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion give informed consent participate study randomize become either inoculated HRV-16 ( n=20 ; 10 male+10 female ) placebo ( saline 0.9 % , n=20 , 10 male+ 10 female ) . After one week second inoculation HRV-16 perform group . In group , 50 % subject sero-negative 50 % sero-positive HRV-16 . One hundred TCID50 unit HRV-16 ( spray 0.5 mL nostril supine position randomize manner ) administer . The main study parameter rate infection ( define positive viral culture , qPCR and/or four-fold rise antibody titre ) cause HRV-16 inoculation . Secondary endpoint include duration incubation period , effect HRV-16 ( re- ) infection cold symptom spirometry , kinetics HRV-16-induced local inflammation parameter nasal wash ( include immune cell cytokine production ) , kinetics HRV-16-induced systemic immune response ( include circulate cytokine ) , ability HRV modulate systemic immune response ( reflect ex vivo production inflammatory mediator stimulate leukocyte ) , effect seropositivity clinical immunological response , effect HRV-16 infection faecal nasal-pharyngeal microbiota host transcriptome metabolome .</detailed_description>
