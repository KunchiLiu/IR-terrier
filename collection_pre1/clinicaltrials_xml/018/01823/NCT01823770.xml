	<brief_summary>Several study report association restless legs syndrome ( RLS ) , HTA cardiovascular disease . The mechanism involve relationship remain unknown , several evidence favor role periodic limb movement sleep ( PLMS ) , pattern frequently associate RLS . Sympathetic overactivity associate PLMS increase pulse rate blood pressure coincident PLMS . PLMS-related repetitive nocturnal blood pressure fluctuation could contribute risk high blood pressure , heart disease , stroke patient RLS , especially elderly . Several study already report dopaminergic agonist reduce severity RLS PLMS index . Do dopaminergic agonist reduce risk cardiovascular disease associate autonomic dysfunction patient RLS ? Nocturnal BP ( blood pressure ) decline major clinical implication , loss normal reduction BP sleep associate high risk cardiovascular morbidity mortality . The main aim study evaluate impact rotigotine patch treatment validate cardiovascular risk factor ambulatory BP night , day night-to-day ratio , endothelial function patient idiopathic RLS compare placebo .</brief_summary>
