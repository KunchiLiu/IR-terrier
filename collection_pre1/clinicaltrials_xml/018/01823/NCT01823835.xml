	<brief_summary>This study multi-institution , Phase Ia/Ib/IIa open-label , dose-finding , safety , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , proof-of-concept study GDC-0810 single agent combination palbociclib and/or LHRH agonist . The study divide 3 phase : Phase Ia , Phase Ib , Phase IIa . During Phase Ia ( dose escalation phase ) , GDC-0810 single agent administer orally continuous daily dose regimen Day -7 lead-in period single dose PK evaluation prior start daily treatment . The incidence dose-limiting toxicity ( DLTs ) evaluate Day -7 first cycle ( 28 day ) treatment ( 35 day total ) . Depending safety tolerability , participant assign sequentially escalate dos GDC-0810 use standard 3 + 3 design . During Phase Ib ( dose escalation expansion phase ) , participant receive GDC-0810 palbociclib and/or LHRH agonist determine recommend Phase II dose ( RP2D ) ass safety tolerability concomitant administration . During Phase IIa ( dose expansion phase ) , participants previously treat aromatase inhibitor ( AI ) treat RP2D characterize safety , PK , pharmacodynamics , anti-tumor activity GDC-0810 .</brief_summary>
