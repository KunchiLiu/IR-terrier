	<brief_summary>Hereditary non-polyposis colon carcinoma ( HNPCC Lynch-Syndrome ) rare cause colorectal cancer cause gene defect -called mismatch repair gene . Patients present young age colorectal cancer polyp develop faster malignant lesion comparison classical sporadic adenoma . New advance imaging modality high definition image virtual chromoendoscopy theoretical advantage improve detection increase polyp detection . In patient HNPCC polyp detection show increased classical chromo-endoscopy high definition endoscopy narrow band imaging ( NBI ) ( virtual chromo-endoscopy modality activate button endoscope ) , comparison white light endoscopy . However , back-to-back study randomization order image modality . It therefore clear whether really image enhancement add increase polyp detection achieve second inspection mucosa . In trial investigator want assess real additional value virtual chromo-endoscopy polyp detection patient Lynch syndrome . The investigator use high definition pentax system compare white light endoscopy i-scan , incorporated virtual chromo-endoscopy mode system .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hereditary non-polyposis colon carcinoma ( HNPCC ) Lynch syndrome rare cause colorectal cancer cause defect mismatch repair gene . Because , colorectal cancer develop accord classical adenoma-carcinoma sequence , result fast progression malignant lesion . As result patient typically present young age colorectal cancer associate cancer endometrium ovarian cancer . The risk cancer patient Lynch syndrome estimate 60-90 % colon cancer present mean age 44 year . Colonoscopy consider gold standard polyp detection . However polyp miss rate report 2 % large adenoma ( &lt; 10mm ) , 13 % lesion 5 10 mm 26 % small lesion ( 1-5 mm ) . Between 2 6 percent carcinoma miss , result interval cancer . Typically , HNPCC small colorectal lesion already harbor cancer high grade dysplasia , make early detection small lesion even clinically relevant average risk population . New endoscopic image system currently available high definition video signal incorporate feature virtual chromoendoscopy . High definition endoscopy become new gold standard endoscopy , since available new type commercially available endoscope . The use high definition endoscopy may lead improved recognition subtle flat lesion . Furthermore , use filter technique accentuate superficial change mucosal architecture help characterize polyp . I-scan postprocessing filter incorporate high definition processor ( EPKi ) new Pentax endoscope . The technique highlight change surface vessel architecture 3 different modification ( call surface enhancement , tone enhancement contrast enhancement ) . In randomized trial patient positive feces occult blood test show system detect significantly polyps standard resolution white light . Current literature suggest classical chromoendoscopy indigocarmine ( Huneberg , lecomte ) narrow-band imaging ( NBI ) increase detection polyp HNPCC patient . Although study cross-over design , randomization image modality either possible ( case chromoendoscopy ) apply ( case NBI ) . So clear whether polyp detect advanced imaging technique , simply second inspection colon . The aim study ass additional value i-scan polyp detection HNPCC patient comparison high definition white light endoscopy ( HD-WLE ) randomize control cross-over trial . The investigator also want investigate effect second inspection round polyp detection .</detailed_description>
