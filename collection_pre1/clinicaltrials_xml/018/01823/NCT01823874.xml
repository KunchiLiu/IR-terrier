	<detailed_description>This project compare analgesic effect immersive Virtual Reality delivery method , Firsthand ID , current standard care HMD system laboratory thermal pain test . Background Significance- Although advance medicine lead development numerous opioid analgesic , excess procedural pain continue major point concern patient health professional clinical setting.1 Pharmacological analgesic , treatment acute pain , unpopular among many patient due potential side effect , commonly nausea , cognitive dysfunction , constipation . 2 Within past 10-15 year immersion immersive virtual reality ( VR ) distraction therapy employ reduce procedural pain burn victim relative success . 3 Patients treat VR along standard medication report reduction pain reduce time spend think pain procedure . 4 In laboratory study use functional neuroimaging ( fMRI ) , subject report pain reduction use VR therapy , also see demonstrate decrease pain-related brain activity . 5 VR believe effective base gate theory cognitive load , due fact person process finite amount incoming information conscious attention need perceive pain . 1,6 Consistent idea amount information important factor effectiveness , show High-Tech-VR ( 60 degree field-of-view , user interactivity , sound effect , head track ) device effective analgesic therapy Low-Tech-VR system ( 35 degree field-of-view , lack : interactivity , sound effect head track ) .1 More recently study show interactivity important factor VR responsible decrease pain unpleasantness time spend think pain , increase fun . 7 Interactivity say increase immersion VR world . 7 VR immersion , define Slater Wilber , objective , quantifiable description sensory input VR system deliver subject . 8 This distinct entity separate presence , subjective psychological illusion world create user mind . 8 . Increasing immersion facilitates strong illusion presence serve subsequent great distractor effect thus , decrease perception painful stimulus . A major obstacle wider test proliferation potential benefit VR analgesia due excessive cost technical limitation immersive display hardware , specifically head-mounted display ( HMDs ) . Firsthand develop arm-mounted high resolution 3D display , Firsthand ID , delivers high quality image immersive experience significant cost saving compare current standard care use HMDs . This project propose scientific feasibility study compare analgesic effect Firsthand ID current standard care HMD system laboratory thermal pain test .</detailed_description>
