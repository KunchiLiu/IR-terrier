	<detailed_description>This Stage II randomize trial provide rigorous test Culturally Informed &amp; Flexible Family Based Treatment Adolescents ( CIFFTA ) develop part Stage I treatment development effort yield promising preliminary finding . Drug use rate high among Hispanic middle school youth date treatment meet criterion `` Well Established '' treatment substance abuse Hispanic adolescent . Further treatment Hispanic youth family complicate fact family often differ mainstream population culture-related value , beliefs behavior directly impact engagement , retention , efficacy/effectiveness drug treatment . Our effort develop powerful treatment begin Stage 1 study lead development multi-component treatment include flexible manual allows treatment tailor unique characteristic individual family . The current Stage II trial randomize 220 Hispanic adolescent age 14-17 meet DSM-IV criterion Substance Abuse 4-month treatment either CIFFTA Traditional Family Therapy . The study test CIFFTA 's efficacy impact drug use , risky sexual behavior , severe behavior problem , hypothesize mechanism change . Should line research continue successful , potential contribute field highly innovative efficacious treatment Hispanic drug abuse adolescent , good understand mechanisms treatment efficacy , also framework future flexible tailored treatment use good address unique need special population . Design Methods : The study divide three phase . The first phase ( month 1- 5 ) prior initiation randomize trial focus : 1 ) clarify manual section finalize assessment measure , 2 ) hire train therapist assessor , 3 ) set web-based data collection system . The second phase ( month 6-47 ) include implementation randomize trial delivery clinical treatment . Beginning month 6 begin recruit 220 Hispanic adolescent ( 14-17 year age ) meet DSM-IV criterion Substance Abuse Dependency . Following screening , consent assessment , adolescent family randomly assign either ( 1 ) Culturally Informed Flexible Family-Based Treatment Adolescents ( CIFFTA ) Traditional Family Therapy ( TFT ) . The two condition test four month intervention two session per week . The participation adolescent family clinical service end approximately month 48 grant . The third phase ( month 48-60 ) focus completion follow-up assessment , data clean logic check , data base lock , analysis , interpretation reporting finding . Assessments conduct baseline , termination ( 4 month ) , 6 month follow-up ( 10 month post baseline ) , 12 month follow-up ( 16 month post baseline ) . Data urine analysis , self-reports therapeutic alliance data service utilization outside program , also collect throughout entire course therapy service utilization continue period follow-up assessment . Longitudinal data analysis ( growth curve model ) use test study hypothesis . More detail detail randomize trial procedure provide . Randomized Study Design . This randomized clinical trial 220 14-17 year old Hispanic adolescent meet DSM-IV criterion Substance Abuse , family assess baseline , randomize one two outpatient condition ( CIFFTA TFT ) receive treatment twice weekly four month , assess follow termination , 6 month follow termination ( T3 ) 12 month follow termination ( T4 ) . Randomization stratify gender , number comorbid psychiatric disorder , whether mandate treatment , whether take medication upon entry program . Inclusion Family member study . The target adolescent parents/guardians asked participate assessment treatment . All family member live household target adolescent invited participate family treatment assessment . Our previous project successful identify engage family member treatment well retain throughout course treatment . In Stage I project successful engage family member treatment indicated fact average three family member per participant household participate family intervention component . Participant Recruitment Plan : We strong partnership Miami Behavioral Health Center run Miami-Dade County Juvenile Addiction Receiving Facility youth meet DSM-IV criterion drug abuse approximately 80 % youth Hispanic . Our previous research project receive many referral JARF bound increase locate partner agency . In currently NCMHD prevention study 11-14 year old Hispanic youth parent successful recruit community clinic , middle school counselor , trust counselor directly community . One highly successful strategy conduct interview research program Spanish language television . This strategy use initiation randomization produce large wave interested family project facilitate prompt fill slot . Similar intervention Spanish radio equally effective . These strategy utilize participation rate low . Screening Assessment Procedures . Study personnel train identify substance abuse youth family explain research study detail . Those interested ask sign inform consent allow screen inclusion/exclusion criterion . Those individual meet screen criterion go baseline part assessment . Participants meet criterion receive another set placement referral . Participants randomize immediately baseline test give name therapist contact schedule first therapy session . All participant assess 4 month baseline ( post-treatment - T2 ) , 10 month baseline ( Follow-up 1 T3 ) 16 month baseline ( Follow-up 2 - T4 ) . All assessment administer highly trained competent Master 's level research assistants bilingual English Spanish . Our assessor work multiple project use type self-report interview measure propose study . All measure consent available English Spanish ensure primarily Spanish-speaking adolescent parent exclude . Each assessment interview last approximately 3 hour consist three part : individual interview adolescent , individual interview parent , family interview session . To ensure participation T2-T4 assessment , family pay $ 40 T2 $ 75 T3 $ 100 T4 , complete assessment . The fee may slightly high project work individual participant assessment include multiple family member ( typically adolescent two caregiver ) . The fee mean compensate 3 participant X approximately 3 hour 9 total hour assessment time per time-point . All assessment data enter directly web-based Velos system . Therapist Supervision Adherence Monitoring . Separate weekly clinical meeting hold CIFFTA TFT condition therapist . Each therapist receive formal supervision meeting , addition consults need . Recorded session review , clinical complexity case discuss , good manual implementation emphasize . These meeting help ensure manualized intervention deliver competently . The independent adherence rater randomly select 20 % session condition different treatment phase ( early , mid , late ) adherence rating . These rating document adequacy treatment session follow specific manual intervention treatment strategy . Ratings fall adequacy dimension/component trigger increase supervision focus dimension necessary , re-training . Adherence raters train use establish adherence checklist two study condition develop use successfully previous study . The condition supervisor hold gold-standard inter-rater reliability adherence rating raters train achieve intra-class correlation coefficient .70 high , least 80 % agreement across item . Inter-rater reliability check regularly avoid drift . Prevention Dropouts study . To ensure retain much sample possible , participant contact assessment specialist entire course study . Additional procedure establish retain Ss study , ensure follow-up assessment , include : 1 ) conduct assessment convenient location family include home necessary , 2 ) pay family participation assessment , 3 ) conduct additional service utilization phone interview point formal assessment point , 6 , 8 , 12 , 14 month post-baseline , 4 ) update contact information regular interval , 5 ) obtain name three contact person close family member may contact Assessment Specialist event family unreachable assessment time-points ( included consent form ) . Treatment Conditions : Traditional Family Therapy ( TFT ) . The TFT condition intend control many factor present CIFFTA except systematic integration individual level work psycho-educational module within flexible treatment package . This control intervention use Stage I study one exception . In Stage I study test `` add '' effect new treatment component flexibility , investigate whether addition would lead significant boost treatment effect . The dosage two intervention equal . To provide rigorous test intervention equivalent dosage two condition , add TFT intervention use Stage I study , additional hour per week . The additional weekly hour consist drug education risky sexual behavior/STI/HIV information deliver youth group format . This additional hour per week per client intervention select consultation director one large local community treatment agency use approach standard care . The Traditional Family Therapy ( TFT ) condition intervention root Structural Family Therapy work Salvador Minuchin . TFT design : 1 ) target behavior problem substance abuse ; 2 ) target youth unwilling seek treatment . The typical length intervention TFT 4 month weekly family session . An important assumption underlie family-oriented model family therapist spend limited number hour participant , change family system ( parent , extend family , non-blood kin ) , family context become force positively influence youth around clock basis . Culturally Informed Flexible Family-Based Treatment Adolescents ( CIFFTA ) . The CIFFTA treatment model three major component - Family Therapy , Individual Therapy , Psycho-educational Modules - deliver 16 week two session ( 60 minute ) per week format . One session typically family session may include Family Therapy Psycho-educational module design family parent alone . The session typically adolescent alone , may include individual treatment Psycho-educational module design adolescent . CIFFTA flexible manual allows selection psycho-educational module address specific family adolescent clinical cultural issue central life family . CIFFTA outpatient treatment . Home visit although infrequent , may critically important time key member disengage therapy must re-engaged . Visits school , court , important institution adolescent 's ecology also allow need ( usually maximum 2-3 visit per family ) . Individual characteristic target modification CIFFTA include : ) impulsive involvement unhealthy behavior drug use , risky sexual behavior , criminal activity , b ) co-occurring psychiatric disorder . Individual level factor support healthy development promote revised CIFFTA : 1 ) increase motivation work toward healthy development , 2 ) life skill acquisition , 3 ) goal setting , 4 ) knowledge short long term drug effect HIV risk , 4 ) improve decision making . Family characteristic target modification CIFFTA include : ) maladaptive response immigration acculturation process stress , b ) parental neglect , c ) verbal physical violence , ) interaction reward/reinforce maladaptive behavior ( i.e. , coercive process ) . Family level factor support healthy development promote revised CIFFTA improvement : 1 ) parenting practice , 2 ) parent-adolescent attachment , 3 ) parental guidance leadership , 4 ) stability home environment , 5 ) directness clarity communication , 6 ) positive/supportive family interaction . Individual family level target change must specifically able address ecological factor well . For example , parent practice may improve good monitor adolescent 's peer ; parental leadership guidance may focus take active role advocacy school ; adolescent skill may become important well address peer pressure peer context . CIFFTA Thematic Psycho-Educational Modules Component The thematic module component CIFFTA provide parent adolescent focus information/educational session specific area relevant family . Content process emphasize session , however content heavily emphasized module process work ( e.g. , shape good communication , deepen understanding , process past trauma ) heavily emphasize family session .</detailed_description>
