	<detailed_description>Repetition self-harm common , range 6 % 30 % 12 month . Repetition strongly associate subsequent suicide important implication healthcare resource . In every country include Ireland , fatal suicide attempt rank among top ten cause death individual age one three lead cause death 15 -35 year age group . Previous study intervention reduce repetition self-harm unselected patient group unsuccessful reduce proportion repeater . These intervention include use antidepressant , problem solving , intensive care outreach , emergency card , psychosocial crisis intervention , guarantee inpatient shelter case emergency . In study involve use low cost postcard episode self-poisoning , although significant difference proportion individual patient repeat self-harm detect , clinically statistically significant reduction number event per individual 50 % . Only non-pharmacological intervention report effective reduce repetition select subset population self-harm include ; partial hospitalization , dialectical behaviour therapy psychodynamic interpersonal therapy . These intervention resource intensive therefore may applicable carefully select patient . Given recent global financial crisis consequent diminution health care resource , intervention need could deliver economically entire population patient self-harm . In light grow interest use text message intervention healthcare , investigator focus study explore potential use text message reduce repeat self-harm patient present Emergency Department ( ED ) . There establish research evidence use text message remind patient schedule medical appointment , coordinate medical staff , deliver medical test result monitor patient side effect follow treatment . In review literature use text message clinical healthy behaviour intervention , Wei et al . ( 2011 ) find among 16 randomized control trial , 10 report significant improvement intervention six report difference suggest positive trend . In one meta-analysis four randomise trial mobile phone-based intervention smoke cessation , report text message intervention result significant increase short-term self-reported quitting ( RR 2.18 , 95 % CI 1.80 2.65 ) . In review , data internet mobile phone programme pool meta-analysed , find significant increase short- , long-term , self-reported quitting ( RR 2.03 , 95 % Conficence Intervals ( CI ) = 1.40 2.94 ) . In study text message service base qualitative interview 12 young people , aim provide young people information cannabis help reduce consumption drug , participant report saw message flexible discrete , personally mean . They pay attention message mass approach public information broadcast TV . Along factor , participant report feeling motivated decrease level cannabis abuse maintain reduce level . . In another study , young adult 3 urban EDs ( n= 45 ; age 18 24 year , 54 % woman ) identify hazardous drinker Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption Score randomly assign researcher weekly text message-based feedback goal setting ( Intervention ) , weekly text message-based drinking assessment without feedback ( Assessment ) , control receive text message . At 3 month , find participant expose text message-based intervention 3.4 ( Standard Deviation ( SD ) = 5.4 ) few heavy drinking day last month 2.1 ( SD 1.5 ) few drink per drinking day compare baseline . In recent randomised trial Ireland supportive text message patient depression comorbid alcohol use disorder , trend towards find great cumulative abstinence duration group receive twice daily supportive text message compare control group receive fortnightly tank text message : 88.3 ( SD=6.2 ) vs. 79.3 ( SD=24.1 ) , t=1.78 , df=48 , p=0.08 . In trial , adjust baseline score , patient supportive text message group also significantly low Beck 's Depression Inventory Scores compare control group ; 8.5 ( SD=8.0 ) vs. 16.7 ( SD=10.3 ) respectively , F ( 1 , 49 ) = 9.54 , p=0.003 , Æžp2=0.17 . In study Owens et al . ( 2010 ) engage group self-harmers development text-messaging intervention reduce repetition self-harm , three broad category message emerge , namely , affirm validated emotion ( e.g . `` 's ok feel angry '' ) , prescribed action , distraction cognitive strategy ( e.g . `` call Samaritans , '' `` warm bath '' , '' take minute time '' ) interrogative design initiate dialogue ( e.g . `` want talk ? '' ) . They also find group unable reach agreement set message might work circumstance reduce urge self-harm enable people feel care , conclude instead text message may need individualise . A major limitation study small sample size 8 people . Furthermore , participant study report envisage would respond text message rather actually respond text message could vary significantly report . In recent randomised trial Ireland generic supportive text message patient depression comorbid alcohol use disorder , 20 24 patient ( 83 % ) report intervention play useful role help improve mental health . Recently , Samaritans Ireland introduce limit interactive text message programme patient experience suicidal ideation . This service allow client receive support crisis via interactive text message programme train volunteer . After extensive review literature use Google Scholar , MEDLINE , Pub Med , ERIC , Web Science , Science Direct PsychINFO , publish randomised trial find use text message deliver via mobile phone intervention address suicidal ideation repeat self-harm patient present self-harm ED . Thus , investigator seek determine text message useful effective strategy help reduce frequency intensity thought self-harm depressive symptom patient discharge ED follow presentation self-harm . The investigator hypothesize supportive , informative interactive text message deliver patient discharge ED episode self-harm significantly reduce frequency intensity thought self-harm self-harming behaviour patient compare receive follow-up treatment usual . A secondary hypothesis patient receive text message report favourable experience overall satisfaction system .</detailed_description>
