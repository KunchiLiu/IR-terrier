	<brief_title>Aborption Metabolism Lyophilized Black Raspberry Food Products Men With Prostate Cancer Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To conduct dose-escalation study determine safety compliance vary lyophilized black raspberry ( LBR ) delivery vehicle ( gummy confection nectar ) two different dos . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To precisely quantify change content distribution black raspberry phytochemical metabolites blood urine correlate concentration prostate tissue phytochemical . II . Measure ability black raspberry gummy confection nectar alter hormonal pattern ( low insulin-like growth factor-1 [ IGF-I ] , high insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 [ IGF-BP3 ] , low androgen ) consistent reduce prostate carcinogenesis parallel enhance capacity quench reactive oxygen . III . Investigate histopathologic , immunologic , molecular biomarkers associate prostate carcinogenesis may serve surrogate endpoint biomarkers provide information regard ability modulate black raspberry . IV . Determine consumption black raspberries alters molecular marker human prostate include : ( ) neuroendocrine marker IGF-I IGF-BP3 , ( b ) signal transduction marker phosphatase tensin homologue ( PTEN ) phospho-AKT , ( c ) angiogenesis regulator ( vascular epithelial growth factor ( VEGF ) . V. Collect store plasma peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) patient assess systemic marker inflammation immune response . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study lyophilize black raspberry gummy confection nectar . Patients assign 1 7 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients follow regular diet 4-6 week undergo prostatectomy . ARM II : Patients follow low polyphenol diet 4-6 week undergo prostatectomy . ARM III : Patients follow low ellagitannin diet 4-6 week undergo prostatectomy . ARM IV : Patients follow low ellagitannin diet receive lower-dose black raspberry gummy orally ( PO ) daily 4-6 week undergo prostatectomy . ARM V : Patients follow low ellagitannin diet receive higher-dose black raspberry gummy PO daily 4-6 week undergo prostatectomy . ARM VI : Patients follow low ellagitannin diet receive lower-dose black raspberry nectar PO daily 4-6 week undergo prostatectomy . ARM VII : Patients follow low ellagitannin diet receive higher-dose black raspberry nectar PO daily 4-6 week undergo prostatectomy .</detailed_description>
