	<brief_summary>A randomized , double-blind trial adult male acute dehydrate diarrhea cholera compare safety , tolerability efficacy HAMS HO-ORS , HAMS 2.5 % Acetate HO-ORS , HAMS 6 % Acetate HO-ORS HO-ORS . The primary hypothesis least one hypo-osmolar ORS contain high amylose maize starch 6 % acetate ( HAMSA6-HO-ORS ) , hypo-osmolar ORS contain high amylose maize starch 2.5 % acetate ( HAMSA2.5-HO-ORS ) hypo-osmolar ORS contain high amylose maize starch ( HAMS-HO-ORS ) , significantly reduce diarrhea duration compare hypo-osmolar ( HO ) ORS . Specifically , investigator expect HAMSA6 effective preparation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Burden : Watery diarrhea include cholera continue major cause childhood mortality develop country , estimate 1.5 million child die year . This figure greatly reduce approximately 5 million diarrheal death annually 20 year ago , phenomenon often attribute utilization oral rehydration solution ( ORS ) . - Knowledge Gap : ORS effective correct dehydration reduce mortality , adequately use many country , partly due fact reduce diarrhea . The physiological basis ORS glucose-stimulated sodium fluid absorption inhibit cyclic 3',5'-adenosine monophosphate ( cAMP ) diarrhea mediator inhibit sodium chloride absorption . The conventional glucose-based ORS reduce duration severity diarrhea may fact paradoxically increase fecal fluid loss . Advances ORS composition include universal adoption hypo-osmolar ORS ( HO-ORS ) 2003 . Recent technological innovation lead use amylase-resistant starch modification treatment diarrhea . Short chain fatty acid ( SCFA ) , produce colon non-absorbed carbohydrate , enhance sodium absorption . An orally administer , non-absorbed starch ( i.e. , one resistant digestion amylase ) significantly reduce fecal fluid loss duration diarrhea patient cholera . - Relevance : Efforts continue improve efficacy oral rehydration solution . As glucose stimulates sodium water absorption small intestine , short chain fatty acid ( SCFAs ) stimulate sodium water absorption colon . In cholera , colonic function also impair due lack SCFAs . The main source SCFAs unabsorbed carbohydrate ferment colon colonic bacteria . The maize starch contain substantial amount amylase resistant starch escape digestion absorption small intestine ferment colon , liberate SCFAs . We expect experimental ORS contain maize starch reduce severity ( stool volume ) enhance recovery ( reduce duration ) diarrhoea .</detailed_description>
