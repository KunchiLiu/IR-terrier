	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate efficacy safety vandetanib , patient advance non-small-cell lung cancer harbor RET gene rearrangement . In 2011 , gene rearrangement RET KIF5B gene ( fusion ) discover young , male lung cancer patient . The following study show gene rearrangement critical tumor initiation maintenance . Of note , growth signal property mediate KIF5B-RET diminished treatment vandetanib . Until , RET rearrangements know thyroid cancer . Vandetanib , multi-kinase inhibitor anti-RET activity , FDA-approved drug treatment adult metastatic medullary thyroid cancer ineligible surgery progressive symptomatic disease . This study aim examine efficacy safety drug , treatment advance lung cancer harbor RET rearrangement .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vandetanib Advanced NSCLC With RET Rearrangement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients screen confirm RET fusion tumor tissue . RET fusion test use fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) central laboratory . Central laboratory study department pathology Seoul National University Hospital ( SNUH ) tumor specimen send department pathology SNUH . Only patient whose tumor confirm RET gene fusion eligible study . Enrolled patient begin daily vandetanib 300 mg one cycle 4 week . Renal-impaired patient ( defined patient creatinine clearance ≥30 &lt; 50 mL/min screen ) start treatment low dose 200 mg . Treatment continue till progression , unacceptable toxicity , till 1 year . Vandetanib administer 1 year patient benefit vandetanib . During administration vandetanib , vital sign , physical examination , ECOG performance status , height , weight , hematology chemistry test , ECG , adverse event concomitant drug evaluate every four week ( one cycle , first 6 month ) eight week ( two cycle , 6 month 1 year ) , necessary , chest X-ray pregnancy test also perform . CT tumor assessment perform every 8 week 1 year . If disease progression suspect , test additionally conduct investigator 's discretion .</detailed_description>
