	<detailed_description>Capital Health Research Ethics Board Orthognathic Surgery Postoperative Antibiotic Use Protocol Background , Rationale Statement Research Question ( ) : Surgical site infection potential problem surgical procedure . Surgical procedure do oral cavity high risk due presence bacterial pathogen . Orthognathic surgery , involve incise oral mucosa create osteotomy underlie bony structure . Of potential complication arise surgery , post operative infection ( POI ) common . POI significant impact surgical outcomes associate increase cost health care system . The literature quite clear benefit presurgical prophylactic antibiotic reduce rate post operative surgical site infections.1 Currently conflict literature recommend length patient receive antibiotic postoperative course , majority study small sample sizes.2,3 Orthognathic surgery consider clean-contaminated surgery suspect POI rate 10-15 % .2 In 1999 Bentley et . al conduct randomize control trial compare 1day vs 5day regimen antibiotic follow orthognathic surgery.4 This trial stop due drastic difference see two group , 6.7 % 5 day course compare 60 % see 1 day group.4 This data vary greatly rate infection investigator see department use 1 day course antibiotic . Chow et al . 2007 retrospective chart review complication see orthognathic surgery . They find rate infection significantly decrease continue antibiotic post operative course compare use one prophylactic dose . They find infection rate 17.3 % single preoperative IV dose , 5.1 % pre-operative dose 2 day post-operative , 7.7 % pre-operative dose 3 day post-operative antibiotics.5 They also find significant difference rate infection compare 2 day 14 days.5 A meta-analysis Danda et al . 2011 find regimen consist single dose preoperative antibiotic follow extended term postoperatively effective decrease surgical site infection . They find incidence decrease 3.2 time , great effect note administration 2 days.2 Even meta-analysis average number patient 8 study 67 , total number patient include 532.2 This show need randomize controlled study large sample size order determine best antimicrobial regimen patient . The majority study investigate rate infection orthognathic surgery use penicillin antibiotic choice due spectrum coverage oral microbe reasonably tolerate patients.2,4-8 In investigator department cefazolin antibiotic choice lower rate infection observe compare penicillin . The investigator suspect low rate infection cefazolin due increase gram negative coverage well resistance beta lactamases . This influenced investigator decision use first generation cephalosporin instead penicillin first line antimicrobial . In patient allergic penicillin , clindamycin use . The criteria diagnosis infection follow CDC guideline SSI . The primary outcome determine benefit extend antimicrobial postoperative course follow orthognathic surgery . Secondary outcome include compare rate infection cefazolin/cephalexin group clindamycin group , rate infection different surgical procedure . Currently CDHA standard perioperative antimicrobial regimen orthognathic surgery patient one preoperative prophylactic dose 2g IV cefazolin follow 1g IV every 8 hr 3 dos . Patients allergy penicillin receive one preoperative prophylactic dose IV Clindamycin 600mg , follow 600mg IV every 8 hr 3 dos . The investigator plan conduct double blind randomize controlled trial compare effect single day post operative antibiotic extend 3 day course antimicrobial infection rate . Both group receive IV prophylactic dose follow 3 IV dos postoperatively . Group 1 receive PO antibiotic 2 subsequent day follow IV treatment , group 2 receive PO placebo . A placebo use order blind two group patient , surgeon investigator aware patient receive extended regimen antibiotic . This avoid potential bias patient report symptom side effect , surgeon 's bias diagnosis surgical site infection . Subject Selection : All patient age 16 year undergoing orthognathic surgery QEII VG hospital eligible participate study . All surgeon operate VG site ask include patient study . These include patient undergo either isolated Lefort I osteotomy , bilateral sagittal split osteotomy , functional genioplasties , combination three procedure . Wisdom teeth , present , also extract time surgery . Exclusion criterion include use antibiotic past 2 week , active oral odontogenic infection , significant medical condition , patient immunocompromised . All patient history physical examination , CBC , INR/PTT , electrolytes well radiographic evaluation prior surgery . A power analysis do determine require patient sample size study . This do use 5 % change infection clinically significant type I error 0.05 0.90 power . The sample size require would 397 patient . The investigator would like enroll many possible next 2 year anticipate enroll approximately 500 patient . Study enrollment finish 2 year time start date , unless require sample size meet time may decide extend length . Research Plan : All patient enrol study receive standard preoperative IV prophylactic antibiotic , follow 3 IV dos postoperatively . The patient randomly allocate either placebo antibiotic group presurgical assessment appointment . This allocation do clinical nurse , patient give study patient number hand envelope folder mixed sufficiently , inside envelope paper A B denote Shoppers Drug Mart pharmacy main floor VG hospital dispense accord bottle receive . This record beside study number , unblinded study conclude . Blinding important avoid bias assessment infection surgeon , avoid bias reporting symptom either infection side effect antibiotic . Following completion IV antibiotic regimen , group 1 receive oral cephalexin clindamycin four time per day 2 day group 2 receive placebo four time per day 2 day . All patient also send home specific oral hygiene instruction addition chlorhexidine 0.12 % rinse use 2 week postoperatively . Patients assess sign infection recovery progress daily hospital stay regular recall visit 2 week 4 week follow discharge . There additional time requirement cost patient participate study . The diagnosis infection make accord CDC criterion surgical site infection include : purulent drainage , wound culture know pathogen , least one sign symptoms infection ( pain , tenderness , localize swelling , redness heat ) 1 . The patient may withdrawl study time . A patient may remove study significant change patient medical condition . An interm review rate infection do data demonstrate increase risk patient participate study , study stop unblinded . All adverse event , serious adverse event , adverse drug reations report Oral Maxillofacial Surgery Department patient assess resident attend surgeon . Analysis Data All data organize pooled accord specific group . Following study blind undone , primary outcome investigate rate infection analyze four group , 1 day cefazolin , 3 day cefazolin/cephalexin , 1 day clindamycin , 3 day clindamycin . Each 1 day group compare 3 day group order determine length time antibiotic effect rate infection . Then 1 day group 3 day group compare different type antibiotic see type antibiotic bearing length require . These comparison do use chi square formula look statistical significance . This analysis also use compare rate infection type surgical procedure do . Each group also analyze possible confounding factor include time surgery , age , sex , oral hygiene status . Confidentiality All data keep secure research team store locked office filing cabinet , password protect file secure hospital network . Only investigator , research nurse access data . Following study , data keep locked cabinet least 25 year require law . Harms As patient receive standard current protocol use investigator center , test group receive addition 2 day antibiotic . The risk associate participation study see prolong antibiotic use . These include allergic reaction range rash anaphylaxis , toxic reaction kidney , liver , gastrointestinal secondary infection candida resistant pathogen . If anaphylaxis occurs normal protocol follow treatment monitoring . In event adverse event antibiotic stop secondary infection treat appropriately . In case post operative infection treat 10 day course appropriate antibiotic . Benefits Overall benefit study determine ideal length postoperative antibiotic prevent post operative surgical site infection patient undergo orthognathic surgery . The group receive extend course antibiotic potentially may lower rate infection . Conversely , placebo group may rate infection avoid potential side effect extend antibiotic treatment . Disclosure Any Financial Compensation There monetary compensation participation study . Either antibiotic placebo provide patient cost . References 1 .
