	<brief_title>PK Study iOWH032 Adult Male/Female Healthy Volunteers &amp; Adult Males With Cholera</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study conduct two part . The first part ( Part A ) evaluate pharmacokinetics , safety tolerability iOWH032 healthy , adult Bangladeshi volunteer . The second part ( Part B ) evaluate pharmacokinetics , safety tolerability iOWH032 adult Bangladeshi patient cholera . While female participant include Part A , male patient enrol Part B . The rationale exclude woman Part B difficulty separate urine stool severely dehydrate female rapid rate purge . Moreover , difficult retain adult female hospital improvement diarrhoea household responsibility , might impact compliance small study . Further , sex difference pharmacokinetics iOWH032 find study conduct healthy subject US , include 42 male female , sex differnces observe preclinical study .</detailed_description>
