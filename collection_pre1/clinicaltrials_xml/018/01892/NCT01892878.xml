	<brief_title>Clinical Outcome Fusion Results Using VerteLoc® Facet Fixation Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design : Non-randomized , prospective , single arm clinical trial Patient Population Sample Size : Patients ( n=25 ) 2 clinical site , medically evaluate , find appropriate , agree treatment lumbar decompressive laminectomy facet fixation , include unilateral and/or bilateral posterolateral fusion accord accept medical standard . Objectives : The primary objective study : 1 . Evaluate fusion status facet joint follow laminectomy facet fixation use VerteLoc system combination unilateral and/or bilateral posterolateral fusion . 2 . Subject success / Clinical outcome : Evaluate reduction baseline VAS back pain score 2-3 week , 3 month , 12 month . The secondary objective study : 1 . Explore effect preoperative bone density facet fusion status ; 2 . Assess ease use VerteLoc system ; 3 . Record operative time use VerteLoc system ; 4 . Monitor occurrence adverse event relate possibly relate use VerteLoc system ; 5 . Monitor occurrence subsequent surgical intervention target level ( ) . 6 . Subject success/Clinical outcome ( Assess additional improvement criterion ) 7 . Evaluate Fusion rate relation DEXA value Inclusion Criteria : Candidates must meet ALL follow : 1 . Have provide consent research sign Institutional Review Board approve Informed Consent ; 2 . Have give appropriate operative consent decompressive lumbar ( L1-S1 ) laminectomy procedure standard care ; 3 . Are skeletally mature , least 18 year age ; 4 . If female , pregnant ; 5 . Agree adhere post-surgical medically prescribed activity limitation and/or physical rehabilitation . Exclusion Criteria : 1 . Previous surgery target adjacent vertebral level ; 2 . More two intervertebral level treat laminectomy procedure ; 3 . Found inappropriate candidate facet fixation use VerteLoc system ; 4 . Require additional and/or surgical technique and/or approach laminectomy index level ( ) , may opinion Primary Investigator confound measurement outcome variable ; 5 . Has medical disorder receiving medication would expect interfere osteogeneses , 6 . Active malignancy patient history malignancy ( except non-melanoma skin cancer ) recurrence within 5 year surgery ; 7 . Active local systemic infection history local systemic infection , immune-deficiency , uncontrolled medical condition , opinion Investigator may increase patient risk confound fusion result ; 8 . BMI &gt; 40 % ; 9 . History tobacco smoking within past 6 month ; 10 . Has history alcoholism , medication drug abuse , psychosis , prisoner , and/or personality disorder , poor motivation , emotional intellectual issue would likely make patient unreliable participation study ; 11 . Are participate clinical trial . Study Duration : 12 month Study Outcomes : The primary study outcome study : 1 . Fusion grade 12 month follow-up use CT scan grade system base : 1 . Complete fusion ; 2 . Partial fusion ; 3 . No fusion ; 2 . Subject success / Clinical outcome : Evaluate reduction baseline VAS back pain score : 1 . 2-3 week 2 . 3 month 3 . 12 month . The secondary outcome study : 1 . Statistical correlation DEXA scan bone mass density score CT radiographic fusion status ; 2 . Surgeon opinion `` ease use '' utilize VerteLoc system ( 0-10 ) ; 3 . Operative time ( minute ) surgical access completion device placement 4 . Occurrence prevalence adverse event relate possibly relate use VerteLoc System ; 5 . Occurrence subsequent surgical intervention target level ( ) . Study Assessments - Intraoperative : Post-placement radiograph ; - 12 month : A/P lateral flexion extension lumbar radiograph lumbar CT scan .
