	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) PET/magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) measure tumor patient undergo clinical image newly diagnose breast cancer . New diagnostic procedure , PET/CT PET/MRI , may effective MRI alone measure tumor patient undergo clinical image newly diagnose breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PET/CT PET/MRI Measuring Tumors Patients Undergoing Clinical Imaging With Newly Diagnosed Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To improve visualization tumor develop good image reconstruction correction method . II . To revise positioning device , necessary , scanner table fit wider size range woman . OUTLINE : Patients undergo clinical fludeoxyglucose F-18 ( FDG ) -PET/CT follow prone breast PET/CT and/or prone breast PET/MRI without gadopentetate dimeglumine ( DTPA ) .</detailed_description>
