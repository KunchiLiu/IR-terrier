	<brief_title>Observational Study Blood Glucose Levels Gut Microbiota Healthy Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Advances characterization diagnosis type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( T2DM ) lead identification rapidly grow number individual fall 'gray zone ' disturb yet non-diabetic fast post-prandial glucose level , term pre-diabetes , impair glucose tolerance ( IGT ) , simply individual fast post-prandial glucose level upper-normal range . All poorly characterize group substantial risk long-term medical complication . Consequently , categorization glucose level 'healthy ' , 'pre-diabetic ' 'diabetic ' increasingly see artificial , glucose level risk diabetes consider continuous variable . In past three decade , glucose level rapidly increase overall population develop develop country alike , result sharp incline prevalence pre-diabetes IGT . In U.S. alone , estimate 79 million people affected 2010 , projection suggest 472 million people affect worldwide 2030 . Up 70-90 % individual IGT pre-diabetes proceed develop full-blown T2DM . Furthermore , micro macrovascular complication , include chronic renal disease , sensory autonomic neuropathy diabetic retinopathy , may present already pre-diabetic stage . In addition , pre-diabetic hyperglycemia link multiple manifestation metabolic syndrome , obesity , hypertension hypertriglyceridemia , independent risk factor major macrovascular event coronary heart disease total vascular mortality . Despite serious risk , strike contrast overt diabetes , hyperglycemia , pre-diabetes IGT fully reversible , 55- 80 % individual report revert normoglycemia normoinsulinemia upon life-style modification . Thus , maintain normal blood sugar level crucial prevention control diabetes various consequence metabolic syndrome . The glycemic index ( GI ) , quantifies glycemic response particular food , develop purpose , low GI diet poor predictive value T2DM development healthy pre-diabetic setting . This limited success GI index may inherent problem method assign single value give food , since individual vary greatly glycemic response food , even nature variation currently poorly characterize . Along line , emerge data group others strongly suggest proper control modulation glycemic response food rely person-specific factor thus , intervention individually tailor achieve proper glycemic control . Although variation host-related genetic factor affect normal post-prandial glycemic response , factor estimate account ~10 % metabolic phenotype . This low estimate reinforce grow incidence diabetes recent year . In contrast , increase importance glucose homeostasis attribute environmental factor composition function cumulative intestinal microbiota . This immense poorly understood ecosystem 1500 specie bacteria , fungi , virus modulate diet , turn , profoundly regulate host metabolic process . Evidence host-microbiota interplay include distinct microbiota composition find T2DM patient ; numerous alteration microbiome composition expression major metabolic pathways find one day switch plant polysaccharide-based diet sugary `` western '' diet germ-free mouse inoculate human microbiota . Furthermore , microbiota-induced local gut inflammation recently link propensity glucose intolerance , reversible upon antibiotic treatment . In study investigator characterize blood glucose response microbiota healthy individual , aim assess influence food intake gut microbiota influence gut microbiota glycemic response .</detailed_description>
