	<brief_title>Breath Monitoring Propofol ( Observational Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Propofol hypnotic drug commonly use induction maintenance general anesthesia . Propofol adiministered intravenously comfortable side effect profile . Patients recover fast propofol anesthesia less likely suffer post-operative nausea vomit compare general anesthesia inhalational anesthetic . However , titration propofol challenge patient may suffer over- underdosing propofol anesthesia . Recent work demonstrate propofol exhale anesthesia . Monitoring propofol concentration breath gas anesthesia may help titrate propofol anesthesia effectively . Yet , unclear propofol concentration vary among patient . This study aim investigate variation cohort patient undergo general anesthesia elective surgical procedure . Propofol measure breath gas continuously induction anesthesia recovery . Blood sample draw start anesthesia 24 h end anesthesia procedure assay propofol blood concentration . We build pharmacokinetic model breath blood measurement order describe variability propofol breath concentration among study participant .</detailed_description>
