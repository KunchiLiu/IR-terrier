	<brief_summary>The ultimate goal reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescription drive development antibiotic resistance community . The primary objective ABACOPD demonstrate sufficiently size clinical study relevant increase `` failure-rate '' patient acute moderate exacerbation COPD ( AE-COPD ) treat placebo instead antibiotic treatment top standard care . A patient classified treatment failure additional antibiotic therapy require treatment period test cure visit ( TOC day 30 , primary endpoint ) .</brief_summary>
