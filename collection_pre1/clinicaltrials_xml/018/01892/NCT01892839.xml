	<brief_summary>Hemodialysis keep patient renal failure alive restore normal health . Retention chemical bind plasma protein therefore poorly remove dialysis may contribute ill health patient receive conventional treatment . This proposal test effect new method design improve removal protein-bound solute dialysis . The effect blood chemical level two different dialysis prescription test patient already undergoing nocturnal in-center hemodialysis three time weekly .</brief_summary>
