	<brief_summary>The airway lung get small lung go . Most simple measurement lung function reflect large 'central ' airway provide information small 'peripheral ' airway . Newer measurement develop give u accurate information small airway work . Indeed small airway seem play significant role asthma term inflammation airway narrow . Recently , new type inhaler formulation develop much small particle size standard formulation . These formulation show go lung , thus get small airway . In study aim compare two extreme available long act beta agonist term particle size i.e . extra fine formoterol ( Atimos ) versus coarse particle salmeterol ( Serevent ) asthmatic abnormal small airway function use breathe test call impulse oscillometry . By use test able find whether use extrafine particle inhaler improve small airway function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The small airway gain great recognition role pathophysiology persistent asthma relevant target asthma treatment ( 1 ) . Pathological abnormality small airway demonstrate regardless asthma severity seem persist even patient stable asthma ( 2 , 3 ) . Historically , small airway difficult ass . Spirometry generally reflect large airway function although mean force expiratory flow ( FEF ) 25 % 75 % FVC ( FEF25-75 ) use assess small airway obstruction . ( 4 ) More recently , impulse oscillometry ( IOS ) use assess role small airway asthma ( 5 ) . IOS effort-independent test , use oscillation differ sound wave derive variety output measurement determine degree total peripheral airway resistance . Resistance 5 Hz reflect total airway resistance central airway resistance approximate use resistance 20 Hz ( R20 ) . The peripheral small airway component thus evaluate calculate difference two measurement i.e . R5 - R20 . We identify database primary care referral , cohort patient appear evidence unmet physiological need term persistent small airway dysfunction , basis impairment R5 R5-R20 despite take step 2/3/4 asthma treatment ( 6 ) . Approximately 32 % patient across step 2/3/4 severely abnormal value R5-R20 ( &gt; 0.05 kPa/L.s ) R5 ( &gt; 150 % ) . Such small airway dysfunction step 3/4 occur despite patient prescribed ICS LABA , although patient prescribe extra fine ICS/LABA extra fine LABA ( i.e . Fostair Atimos ) . In term ICS moiety , observational data show patient take extra fine HFA-beclometasone solution ( Qvar ) equal good control take Fluticasone suspension , receive low maintenance dose ICS ( 7 ) . In another study , patient switch beclometasone suspension solution half dose improvement asthma quality life . In neither study information available regard small airway dysfunction order explain potential improvement HFA-beclometasone ( 8 ) . There paucity information potential benefit extra fine formoterol small airway . In single dosing study compare extra fine HFA versus coarse particle dry powder formulation formoterol , 30 % difference ( absolute difference 2.9 kPa/L.s.min ) R5 AUC0-60min 63 % difference ( absolute difference 2.4 kPa/L.s.min ) R5-R20 AUC0-60min , although primary end point ( 9 ) . 1.2 RATIONALE Thus , primary objective present study compare two extreme available long act beta-agonist formulation - i.e . extra fine HFA formoterol ( Atimos ) versus coarse particle DPI salmeterol ( i.e . Serevent Accuhaler ) . If turns significant improvement small airway function confer extra fine formoterol , would turn support rationale perform chronic study assess clinical impact treat persistent small airway dysfunction step 3/4 switch patient Fostair HFA compare Seretide DPI , term improve asthma control patient small airway phenotype already take conventional ICS/LABA formulation . We use impulse oscillometry ass small airway response use difference resistance measure 5Hz 20Hz ( R5-R20 ) primary outcome . In regard previously report asthmatic patient receive propranolol 104.1 % ( 95 % CI 22.6-185.6 % ) worsen R5-R20 term bronchoconstrictor response propranolol , follow subsequent histamine challenge , 115.6 % ( 95 % CI 55.6-175.7 % ) improvement R5-R20 term bronchodilator response nebulised salbutamol .
