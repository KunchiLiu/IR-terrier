	<detailed_description>The primary objective study evaluate safety tolerability autologous genetically modify T cell transduce express high affinity NY-ESO-1c259 TCR HLA-A201 patient . Eligibility screen perform two step . First , patient undergo prescreening determine correct HLA type order respond engineer T cell therapy , test presence target antigen , NY-ESO-1 LAGE-1 , tumor cell . Patients , HLA-A201 positive test positive expression NY-ESO-1 and/or LAGE-1 myeloma tumor move complete screening procedure determine eligibility study . Patients initially undergo steady-state mononuclear cell apheresis T cell collection . About 3-4 week later ( allow expansion/engineering/releasing engineered T cell ) , patient receive short course cytoreductive chemotherapy prior receive engineer T cell infusion , comprise 1.5 gm/m2 cyclophosphamide , mesna give accordance institutional standard . At day 0 , patient receive dose ≥0.1-1 x 1010 anti-CD3/anti-CD28-costimulated autologous T cell genetically modify express affinity-enhanced NY-ESO-1 T cell receptor ( TCRs ) . A minimum dose 0.1≤x &lt; 1 x 109 permitted . Patients receive low dose level evaluate separately safety efficacy . Patients undergo myeloma restaging approximately 1 week prior T cell infusion , post infusion day +28 , +42 ( week 6 ) , +100 6 month post infusion every 3 month relapse/progression 1 year , whenever come first . At point , patient follow semi-annually 5 year annually long term follow-up monitoring delay adverse event 15 year receive genetically modify T cell , accordance FDA Guidelines .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Written informed consent must obtain patient entry study 2 . Patients must diagnosis myeloma ( see Appendix A diagnostic criterion ) . 3 . Patients must progressive active disease follow prior therapy myeloma : 1. include IMiD proteasome inhibitor separate line combine line therapy 2 . May include prior autoSCT prior alloSCT Patients fail second third line therapy beyond , DPACE , experience partial response rather progressive disease also eligible . 4 . Patients must measurable disease study entry . Measurable disease may include quantifiable detectable level serum urine paraprotein . For patient minimally secretory disease study entry , serum free kappa lambda light chain level , serum free light chain ratio may measure used disease monitoring abnormal . 5 . Patients must HLAA201 determine CLIA certify ( equivalent ) clinical laboratory . ( This determination make preenrollment screen ICF ) 6 . Patients must confirm expression NYESO1 and/or LAGE1 RTPCR , immunohistochemistry quantigene analysis . ( This determination make preenrollment screen ICF ) 1 . Pregnant nursing female 2 . HIV HTLV1/2 seropositivity 3 . Known history myelodysplasia 4 . Known history chronic active hepatitis liver cirrhosis ( suspected laboratory study , confirm liver biopsy ) . 5 . Active Infection HBV HCV Active hepatitis B infection determine test hepatitis B surface antigen . Active hepatitis C. Patients screen HCV antibody . If HCV antibody positive , screen HCV RNA RT PCR bDNA assay must perform screen local laboratory CLIA certification equivalent . Eligibility determine base negative screen value . The test require documentation negative result HCV RNA test perform within 60 day prior screen provide . 6 . Prior allogeneic transplant 7 . History severe autoimmune disease require steroid immunosuppressive treatment . 8 . Active immunemediated disease include : connective tissue disease , uveitis , sarcoidosis , inflammatory bowel disease , multiple sclerosis . 9 . Evidence history significant cardiac , hepatic , renal , ophthalmologic , psychiatric , gastrointestinal disease would likely increase risk participate study . The specific type stress test select PI 's discretion . 10 . Active bacterial systemic viral fungal infection .</criteria>
