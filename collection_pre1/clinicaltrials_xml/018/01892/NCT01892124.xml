	<brief_summary>American Indians ( AIs ) live Northwest high rate diabetes , obesity , tobacco use , depression , risk factor associate cardiovascular disease . Depression diabetes pernicious effect CVD risk susceptibility . This study seek build upon success 1-month , 5-session motivational interviewing ( MI ) CVD prevention component həli ? dxw Project ( aka Healthy Hearts-originally fund RFA-HL-06-002 ; U01 HL HL087322-05 ) . həli ? dxw successfully culturally adapt MI CVD prevention AIs , train AIs implement intervention , conduct preliminary feasibility efficacy trial . Initial result indicate participant enthusiastically embrace MI component program ; however , observation counselor , survey data , feedback participant suggest depressive symptomatology serve barrier achieve CVD preventive behavior desire outcomes ; , time attention underlie depressive symptomatology may enhance motivation CVD prevention behavior , particularly among AIs pre-diabetes Type 2 diabetes . Building upon solid preliminary CVD epidemiological data , preliminary acceptability feasibility utilize MI approach , motivate need address elevate depression diabetes profile həli ? dxw study , investigator develop 3-month , 10-session MI-based cognitive-behavioral-adherence ( MI-CBT-CVD ) treatment program address underlie depressive symptomatology , activate CVD prevention behavior , decrease BMI CVD risk behavior among 50 pre-and recently diagnose diabetic AIs risk CVD . The study propose three innovative significant aim . First , line community-based participatory ( CBPR ) principles pre-established indigenous research protocol tribal community , investigator conduct formative research develop MI-CBT-CVD intervention . Second , investigator conduct pilot randomize two-group , single-site waitlist-controlled clinical trial 10-session , 3-month MI-based cognitive-behavioral treatment CVD prevention ( MI-CBT-CVD ) among 50 pre-and recently diagnose diabetic AI adult depressive symptomatology also risk CVD . Assessments conduct pre post intervention 6-months ( 3 month follow-up ) . Third , investigator disseminate finding tribe well research outlet prepare RO1 conduct full-scale RCT pilot intervention efficacious , acceptable community , feasible . The primary objective determine effect propose culturally-grounded behavioral intervention program ( ) reduce weight measure BMI ( 7-10 % reduction BMI ) ; ( b ) decrease depressive symptomatology ; ( c ) increase physical activity ; ( ) decrease sedentary activity ; ( ) increase healthful food habit ; ( e ) improve biomedical outcome ( e.g. , blood lipid profile , glucose , hemoglobin A1C , blood pressure ) . The intervention culturally relevant utilize exist Native resource personnel wherever possible .</brief_summary>
