	<brief_title>Impact Pulmonary Vein Isolation Exercise Capacity Patients With Chronic Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>III . Goals Project The purpose study determine whether pulmonary vein isolation radiofrequency ablation improve exercise capacity endothelial function patient chronic atrial fibrillation . We hypothesize exercise capacity endothelial function improve patient chronic atrial fibrillation follow pulmonary vein isolation . IV . Background Significance : Easy fatigability frequent complaint patient atrial fibrillation ( AF ) . Prior study demonstrate exercise capacity patient `` lone atrial fibrillation '' le healthy matched control . Other investigator also show adverse effect AF compare peak oxygen uptake VO2 prior cardioversion . At present , majority study focus patient AF either mild cardiovascular disease congestive failure . No study date assess pulmonary vein isolation ( PVI ) via intracardiac ablation able improve exercise capacity patient chronic LSP-AF . This prospective registry ass exercise capacity patient chronic AF ( CAF ) minimum period 3 month ; prior PVI . Chronic AF define patient unsuccessful cardioversion and/or ongoing AF episode ( e.g . year ) . The observed result use establish good understand overall quality life exercise tolerance prior ablation . This registry may expand future second study ass exercise tolerance patient CAF treat alternative treatment strategy . The finding study may begin pave way future clinical practice change best manage patient CAF . Description procedure : Patients require fast refrain smoking least 4 hour prior test session . Arterial Stiffness Arterial stiffness measure non-invasively . Two index arterial stiffness calculate include carotid augmentation index aortic pulse wave velocity subject assume supine position least 10 minute . Blood pressure cuff place arm leg , ECG sensor place wrist . Carotid augmentation index calculate ratio amplitude pressure wave systolic shoulder total pulse pressure . Aortic pulse wave velocity calculate divide distance ( carotid femoral artery ) transit time ( time delay carotid femoral `` foot '' waveform ) . Endothelial Health The VENDYS 5000 BCTM ( Endothelix , Houston , TX ) FDA approve device use measure vascular responsiveness , index endothelial function . It measure change skin temperature fingertip response change blood flow arm induce 5-minute cuff occlusion , provide information vascular health . The subject seat test cuff fix around upper right arm VENDYS probe index finger hand . Fingertip temperatures measure throughout procedure 3 minute deflation cuff . Baseline fingertip temperature measure 3 minute cuff inflation . Following baseline measure , cuff rapidly inflate 200 mmHg 50 mmHg rest systolic blood pressure remain inflated 5 minute . During time , fingertip temperature fall due occlusion blood flow . After 5 minute , cuff rapidly deflate allow blood flow return arm . Skin temperature measure constantly 3 minute . Exercise Capacity Subjects perform modify version Balke2 incremental treadmill exercise test . The test begin 0 % grade constant speed 3.0 mph . The grade increase 1 % every minute speed remain constant . Oxygen consumption , heart rate , rating perceive exertion ( Borg Scale ) measure throughout test total exercise time exhaustion record . Oxygen consumption measure metabolic cart subject breathe mouth piece . Blood pressure ECG monitor continuously . Quality Life Assessment The MOS 36-short form multi-purpose , short-form health survey 36 question . It yield 8-scale profile functional health well-being score well psychometrically-based physical mental health summary measure preference-based health utility index . It generic measure , oppose one target specific age , disease , treatment group . Accordingly , MOS-36 proven useful survey general specific population , compare relative burden disease , differentiate health benefit produce wide range different treatment .</detailed_description>
