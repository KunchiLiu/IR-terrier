	<brief_summary>Dyspnea frequent , mostly unpleasant long-lasting , also often undertreated symptom . Transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) , new non invasive method modify brain activation show good efficacy treatment pain especially clinical context . Given fact dyspnea many common characteristic pain , especially concern brain area involve central processing , hypothesize tDCS may also modify perception dyspnea . In order test , first shall determine whether tDCS significant effect acutely induced dyspnea healthy volunteer . In case promising result pilot study , next step evaluation benefit tDCS patient severe dyspnea .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dyspnea induce breathe combination external resistive load long tube ( induce CO2 rebreathing ) ( result sensation increase respiratory effort air hunger ) . tDCS apply 15 minute either motor/premotor insular cortex ( i.e . 2 brain region previously show involved dyspnea perception and/or modulation ) 2 parallel group healthy subject . For study group , effect tDCS dyspnea perception respiratory parameter compare 2 active ( anodal cathodal ) sham tDCS stimulation ( placebo ) .</detailed_description>
