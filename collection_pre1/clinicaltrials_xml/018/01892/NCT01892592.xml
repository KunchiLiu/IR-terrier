	<brief_summary>The goal pragmatic study improve hypertension ( HTN ) control rate black reduce racial disparity HTN control . To accomplish , investigator propose perform cluster randomize control trial primary care provider ( PCP ) level include 191 PCPs within KPNC East Bay Service Area 45,000 patient HTN registry approximately 15,000 black . The investigator randomize PCP patient panel three-arm trial receive either 1 ) usual care ; 2 ) culturally tailor diet lifestyle coaching ; 3 ) intensify BP management protocol pharmacotherapy . The `` Shake , Rattle Roll '' trial name : 1 ) `` shake '' salt habit ; 2 ) `` rattle '' intensity current BP management ; 3 ) design intervention goal able adapt `` roll '' community clinic outside manage care system . Primary research question : whether primary prevention intervention either diet lifestyle coach intensive pharmacotherapy protocol effective usual care improve rate HTN control black thereby reduce disparity black white . Primary aim : By implement either intervention , investigator reduce disparity hypertension control rate black white 4 % 1 year post-study enrollment . Hypothesis : Among black HTN , diet/lifestyle coach intervention intensify BP management protocol result increase HTN control rate compare usual care . Primary outcome : proportion patient sustain BP control 1 year post-study enrollment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Kaiser Permanente Northern California ( KPNC ) serve population 3 million enrollee , representative socio-demographic characteristic San Francisco Bay Area , Santa Rosa , Sacramento except under-representation rich poor.78 KPNC large nonprofit integrated health care organization country , 22 hospital 44 outpatient facility , care 30 % population region . The majority Californians manage four large hospital network , KPNC system model 167 Program Director/Principal Investigator ( Last , First , Middle ) : Sidney , Stephen , MD , MPH PHS 398/2590 ( Rev . 06/09 ) Page Continuation Format Page prevalent system care state . An effective system-wide intervention KPNC would likely generalizable feasible healthcare network State , thus , could benefit population broadly . The project focus East Bay Service Area ( EBSA ) approximately one-third African American KPNC member HTN receive care within geographical area . The East Bay area , home flagship Oakland Medical Center Richmond Medical Center , comprise 12 city municipality within Alameda County western section Contra Costa County . From Kaiser Permanente 's inception 1945 , nonprofit organization lead innovation , begin prepay health care service offer Richmond shipyard worker World War II . Today , Richmond Oakland Medical Centers home 700 physician 5,600 employee serve quarter million member yearly . Kaiser Permanente East Bay expand service West Contra Costa member . The brand new Pinole Medical Office Building , eight mile Richmond Medical Center offer convenient access member East Bay Area , include Pinole , El Sobrante , Hercules , Rodeo Crockett . The Pinole center provide adult medicine , family practice , pediatrics , obstetrics/gynecology , radiology , lab , pharmacy , health education . For emergency service , member go Richmond Medical Center , labor delivery service , Oakland Medical Center . The fourth member EBSA Alameda Medical Center offer service internal medicine , gynecology , pediatrics , pharmacy , member outreach . Using KPNC model offer several major advantage . Members generally remain plan many year , 94 % retention 1 year 84 % retention 5 year among enrollees 65-74 year old . Sources electronic medical data extensive easy manipulate . They combine produce electronic registry patient uncontrolled HTN ( Figure - Electronic Registry ; source data provide bracket ) . The following information available electronic medical record ( EMR ) system : - Inpatient discharge abstract primary secondary diagnosis procedure cod trained medical record analyst . - Inpatient discharge abstract out-of-plan hospital admission . - Emergency-department outpatient diagnosis cod treat physician . - All outpatient record include BP measurement . - All radiology report generate review radiologist . - Listing major health problem generate frequently update treating physician . - Cardiologist interpretation ECGs . - Reports clinical laboratory study . - Listing outpatient fill prescription complete inpatient medication order . The EMR database validate extensively , combination , show accurately reflect number disease diagnosis , comorbidities , outcomes.79-81 The KPNC Division Research maintain mortality database KPNC member date back 1971 . The primary source mortality data California Department Health Services , maintain registry death cause , Social Security mortality file recent death . With recent loss utility Social Security mortality file , make arrangement frequent update ( quarterly semi-annually ) California Department Health Services mortality file current approximately past 6 month . Mortality also assess KPNC EMR occur hospitalization . The `` Shake , Rattle Roll '' trial name : 1 ) `` shake '' salt habit ; 2 ) `` rattle '' intensity current clinical BP protocol ; 3 ) design intervention ultimate goal able adapt `` roll '' intervention community clinic outside manage care system . Randomization There 194 PCPs EBSA 191 provider African Americans patient panel . The unit randomization primary care provider EBSA ( N=191 ) black patient panel . The 3 PCPs randomize study later date add African American patient panel . All PCPs randomize one 3 arm . To extent possible , strive approximately equal number African Americans HTN arm trial ( approximately 1896 uncontrolled HTN expect per group ) . This accomplish use stratified black patient hypertension clinician 's panel . With intensified BP protocol intervention , quality improvement effort , randomize provider level allow African American patient HTN target intervention BP ever become uncontrolled . We need ask patient willing participate give intervention extension usual care model intensive focus aggressive HTN management African Americans . We seek waiver inform consent intervention local Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) advise IRB administrator waiver likely approve IRB . Being able include African Americans intervention increase generalizability study finding . With diet lifestyle coach intervention , randomize provider level also allow u invite African American patient uncontrolled HTN participate intervention . Even though material use develop intervention available within KPNC , formal coach program diet lifestyle effect HTN currently non-existent . We send letter inform eligible patient on-going improvement project . The patient option opt study return stamp envelope u . If patient choose opt , research staff contact discus enrollment schedule ( Figure - study diagram , ) . As detailed Statistical Analysis Section anticipate enrollment approximately 1896 black uncontrolled HTN arm study spread 2-year period . The randomization process PCPs carry programmer KPNC DOR office ( Oakland , CA ) .</detailed_description>
