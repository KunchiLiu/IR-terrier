	<brief_summary>This single-arm , Simon 2-stage , phase 2 clinical study conduct subject advanced metastatic colorectal cancer previously receive ≥ 1 prior line systemic therapy resistant EGFR inhibitor ( cetuximab panitumumab ) . This trial conduct determine objective response rate ( ORR ) , progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall-survival ( OS ) cetuximab plus tivantinib patient wild-type KRAS CRC resistant anti-EGFR antibody treatment ( cetuximab panitumumab ) show overexpression cMET .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Tivantinib ( ARQ 197 ) Plus Cetuximab EGFR Inhibitor-Resistant MET High Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-arm , Simon 2-stage , phase 2 clinical study conduct subject advanced metastatic colorectal cancer receive ≥1 prior line systemic therapy resistant EGFR inhibitor ( cetuximab panitumumab ) . Fresh tumor tissue need MET testing , thus biopsy required participate trial . In minor percentage subject archival tumor tissue could acceptable analysis.Eligible subject treat tivantinib ( ARQ 197 ) dose 360 mg twice daily ( total daily dose 720 mg ) orally continuous manner cetuximab ( Erbitux ) dose 500 mg/mq i.v . every 2 week . The overall treatment period divide continuous 28 day cycle without treatment interruption . Disease status tumor response assess per modify Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criteria version 1.1 screening ( within 4 week first schedule dose study drug ) , 8 week intervals subject treatment clinically indicate progression disease , withdrawal consent , death , lose follow-up . Tumor measurement also perform end treatment visit do within previous 8 week . Subjects progressive disease time treatment period discontinue study treatment . Subjects stable disease ( SD ) , complete response ( CR ) partial response ( PR ) stay treatment disease progression and/or unacceptable toxicity and/or withdrawal consent document . CR PR must confirm sooner 4 week initial observation . After discontinuation study treatment follow-up period , survival status obtain phone every 3 month subject dy , withdraws consent study , lose follow-up , maximum 12 month .</detailed_description>
