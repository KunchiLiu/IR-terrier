In ancillary study , measure plasma level inflammatory , coagulation , fibrinolysis protein genotype DNA polymorphism among patient enrol HALF PINT trial .

	<brief_title>Coagulation Fibrinolysis Pediatric Insulin Titration Trial ( CAF-PINT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ABSTRACT Hyperglycemia occur frequently among critically ill child associate increased morbidity mortality . Approximately 25 % critically ill child heart lung failure ( i.e. , receive mechanical ventilation and/or inotropes ) develop hyperglycemia within 24 hour admission , hyperglycemia sustain ( last &gt; 50 % PICU stay ) , result 6-fold increase odds mortality . Previous study demonstrate tight glycemic control insulin , aim achieve normoglycemia ( TGC-NL ) result improvement mortality morbidity select group critically ill patient hyperglycemia . However , precise mechanism TGC-NL lead improvement morbidity mortality know . Hyperglycemia known result pro-thrombotic state via activation coagulation impairment fibrinolysis . This pro-thrombotic , anti-fibrinolytic state , may lead intravascular fibrin deposition micro thrombus , key contributor pathogenesis multi-organ failure . We propose take advantage The Heart Lung Failure Pediatric Insulin Titration trial ( HALF PINT ) - NHLBI-funded randomized , control trial design study impact TGC-NL clinical outcome among child heart lung failure - investigate effect TGC-NL inflammation , fibrinolysis , coagulation determine extent improvement derange coagulation fibrinolysis TGC-NL contribute improvement clinical outcome . We propose enroll 800 critically ill patient hyperglycemia heart lung failure HALF PINT study . Since parent trial collect blood sample confirmation blood glucose , approach parent surrogates child enrol HALF PINT trial obtain informed consent participation ancillary study . We collect blood sample ( 3cc child 2 year young , 5ml child 3 year old ) Days 1 , 3 , 5 randomization . We measure plasma level select marker coagulation fibrinolysis genotype DNA polymorphisms correspond gene . We correlate change time biomarkers allocation treatment arm test whether beneficial effect TGC-NL achieve via normalization coagulation fibrinolysis . We also genotype tag SNPs correspond gene test association plasma genetic marker clinical outcome . The result study provide mechanistic insight effect TGC-NL clinical outcome could lead use anti-inflammatory , anti-coagulant pro-fibrinolytic agent adjunctive therapy among select group critically ill child hyperglycemia may amenable tight glucose control high risk adverse clinical outcome pro thrombotic environment . Results study may lead identification protein genetic marker identify critically ill child likely benefit exist anticoagulant therapy activate protein C .</detailed_description>
