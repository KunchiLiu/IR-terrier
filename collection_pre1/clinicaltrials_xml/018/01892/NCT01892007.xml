	<brief_summary>A double-blind randomise active-controlled trial aim ass whether Cogmed ( adaptive ) work memory training result improvement untrained measure cognition , speech perception self-reported hearing ability older adult ( 50-74 year ) mild-moderate hearing loss exist hear aid user , compare active placebo Cogmed ( non-adaptive ) control . It hypothesise improvement train Cogmed task , represent increase work memory capacity , result improve performance cognitive speech perception task engage work memory . We also measure self-reported hearing ability ass self-perceived benefit Cogmed training .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Cogmed Working Memory Training Adult Hearing Aid Users</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One ten people age 55-74 year significant hearing impairment well hearing ear ( define audiometric hear threshold ) . Yet , become increasingly clear challenge face old listener explain audiogram . The ability people hear loss use cognition support context allow compensation degrade auditory input , turn offer promise new cognitive-based rehabilitative intervention . Working memory know highly associate language recent evidence show significant generalisation on-task learning Cogmed work memory training improvement sentence-repetition skill child severe profound hear loss use cochlear implant . This evidence offer support investigation potential benefit work memory training improve speech perception ability hear impaired population . This study aim ass whether Cogmed ( adaptive ) work memory train improves listen ability adult mild moderate hearing loss assess use untrained measurer cognition , speech perception self-reported hearing ability , compare active control ( Cogmed , non-adaptive ) group . A 6 month follow-up assess retention training-related improvement outcomes adaptive training group .</detailed_description>
