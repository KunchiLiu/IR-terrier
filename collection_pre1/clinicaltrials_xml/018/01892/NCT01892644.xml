	<brief_title>Treatment Iron Overload With Deferasirox ( Exjade ) Hereditary Hemochromatosis Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The two important cause iron overload disease human iron-loading disorder hereditary hemochromatosis ( HC ) , transfusional siderosis patient chronic hematological disease like myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) , thalassemia , leukemia . Hemochromatosis . In HC molecular regulation iron uptake across intestinal mucosa disturbed , lead hyperabsorption accumulation iron parenchymal tissue liver , pancreas , endocrine organ heart . Hepcidin , small peptide hormone synthesize liver , apparently function master regulator systemic iron homeostasis ability control efflux iron enterocytes macrophage blood plasma . This happen diminish iron transfer capacity basolateral , transmembrane protein , ferroportin . Expression hepcidin carefully adjust iron status hepatocytes multimolecular signal transduce pathway act positive feedback mechanism increase hepcidin synthesis iron overload ( inflammation ) . Mutation one signal molecule , lead inadequate hepcidin synthesis . The common classic C282Y H63D point mutation hemochromatosis protein HFE , disturbs interaction transferrin receptor 1 , first step hepcidin signal cascade . Homozygosity C282Y strong risk factor serious iron overload disease develop long-lasting , asymptomatic period . In Norway prevalence C283Y homozygosity approximately 0.75 gender . The preclinical , biochemical phenotype HC disclose blood test elevate transferrin saturation marker hyperabsorption iron , increase ferritin concentration surrogate marker grow iron overload . As alternative liver biopsy , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) seem powerful non-invasive method directly assess iron content liver heart . Myelodysplastic syndrome transfusional siderosis . Transfusional iron overload result multiple blood transfusion supply long time period , add approximately 220 250 mg extra iron body . Because iron loading occur via parenteral route macrophage primary target cell , normal homeostatic mechanism respond adequately plasma hepcidin level normal even increase . Even excess iron well tolerate macrophage parenchymal cell , life-threatening iron overload develop much faster transfusional siderosis HFE-associated HC . Myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) heterogeneous group stem cell disorder inefficient hematopoiesis increase risk develop acute myeloid leukemia . The MDS International Prognostic Scoring System ( IPSS ) base number cytopenia , cytogenetic feature number blast bone marrow , enable separation four risk group follow median survival year : low-risk patient , 5.7 year ; intermediate-1 , 3.5 year ; intermediate-2 , 1.2 year ; high-risk 0.4 year . Many patient become transfusion-dependent get serious transfusional iron overload . Iron chelation recommend low-risk intermediate-1 patient probable need lifelong transfusion therapy . Consequences iron overload . If interrupt , continuous iron load point start gradually damage vital organ liver , heart endocrine organ , lead serious disease shorten lifetime . At molecular level persistently increase amount reactive , small molecular weight iron complex sporadic presence free iron blood tissue , probably fundamental pathogenetic mechanism iron overload . These substance highly toxic due strong ability catalyze formation free radical Reactive Oxygen Species ( ROS ) . The activity free radical damage native molecule ( e.g . DNA ) cellular structure consider first step organ tissue injury . In blood , reactive iron exist Non-Transferrin Bound Iron ( NTBI ) , mainly form small molecular weight iron-citrate complex . NTBI rapidly take liver organs add intracellular , reactive labile iron pool ( LIP ) . The presence NTBI LIP find correlate hepatic cardiac damage transfusional siderosis HC . In addition , homeostasis trace metal may abnormal iron overload . Little known issue , warrant deeper study . Treatment . In HC , prefer iron removal therapy venesection , whilst transfusional iron overload treat iron chelators . Clinical aim study . The major objective determine efficacy deferasirox remove iron liver , heart bone marrow HC- MDS-patients iron overload . Explorative aim . Determine correlation novel biomarkers hepcidin NTBI , ferritin transferrin saturation serum ; liver iron concentration ( LIC ) , heart iron concentration ( HIC ) , bone marrow iron . Assess effect iron overload iron depletion either deferasirox venesection , concentration trace metal serum urine HC MDS patient . Study influence iron overload iron depletion either deferasirox venesection , intracellular signal transduction blood cell isolate HC MDS patient . Study influence iron overload iron depletion either deferasirox venesection oxidative damage DNA ( examined urine ) , antioxidant status red blood cell isolate HC MDS patient . Establish reference value investigational serum urine test healthy control subject . Rationale study . The major rationale study relate need assess potential use deferasirox treat HC- MDS-patients iron overload . However , several `` learning objective '' include : impact iron overload iron deplete treatment NTBI , hepcidin , marker oxidative stress , trace metal intracellular signal transduction molecule . Although venesection safe effective mean deplete iron HC patient , may suppress hepcidin thus increase iron absorption , particularly end long treatment period . Also , HC patient feel cumbersome impact frequent phlebotomy daily life , also experience troublesome side effect . The subjective perception venesection side effect recently communicate survey study among 210 HC patient across United States european country . Of , 52 % patient undergoing weekly venesection 37 % patient maintenance phase report side effect `` always '' `` time '' , 16 % would `` definitely '' `` probably '' refuse phlebotomy offered alternative treatment . Therefore , investigation effect chelator potential alternative therapy HC warrant . Chelation therapy may remove excess iron body , may also counteract formation reactive , free radical . In MDS patient transfusion dependency worsen survival due development damage iron overload . With every 500 ng/mL increase ferritin threshold , risk death increase 30 % . Traditionally , iron depletion therapy monitor s-ferritin , decrease iron progressively eliminate . However , s-ferritin non-specific parameter sensitive acute phase reaction associate inflammation , chronic disease tissue injury . Furthermore , s-ferritin offer information burden free radical production stimulate reactive iron . For reason , one aim study investigate whether new blood marker like NTBI hepcidin , along MRI assessment LIC HIC , improve diagnosis iron overload accurately identify patient increase risk iron induce damage therefore benefit iron depletion therapy . Iron overload weaken cellular antioxidant defence result oxidative DNA-damage first step carcinogenesis . Examination influence iron overload iron depletion either deferasirox venesection oxidative damage DNA , antioxidant status red blood cell perform . Increased knowledge intracellular signal transduction influence cellular iron use deferasirox may provide new insight molecular pathogenesis iron overload . This examine single leukocyte cell flowcytometry assay follow intracelluar signal parameter : stress sensor p53 , mTOR NFkB . Finally , little know iron overload interacts metabolism trace metal . The concentration broad spectrum trace metal serum ( S ) urine ( U ) monitor throughout study period Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry ( ICP-MS ) ( 28 ) : boron ( S , U ) , barium ( S , U ) , beryllium ( S , U ) , cadmium ( S , U ) , cobalt ( S , U ) , cesium ( S , U ) , copper ( S , U ) , mercury ( U ) , lithium ( U ) , manganese ( S ) , molybdenum ( S ) , nickel ( S , U ) , lead ( S , U ) , antimony ( S , U ) , selenium ( S , U ) , tin ( S , U ) , strontium ( S , U ) , thallium ( S , U ) , tungsten ( S ) , yttrium ( S , U ) , zinc ( S , U ) . The tolerability deferasirox also assess throughout study , either sole treatment MDS patient compare venesection HC patient . Healthy volunteer use solely controls determine normal blood concentration biomarkers test perform patient . The control treat . Previous clinical trial HC MDS . Deferasirox study variety disease transfusional iron overload , particularly thalassemia . It favorable profile respect efficacy , safety tolerability . However , control clinical study deferasirox HC MDS limit . The study Phatak et al ( 2010 ) first clinical trial demonstrate safety efficacy deferasirox patient C282Y-homzygot hemochromatosis . They show serum ferritin level reduce similarly two cohort give respectively 10 mg/kg/day 15 mg/kg/day deferasirox . Since dose 15 mg/kg/day cause high frequency adverse event ( AEs ) , recommend star dose 10 mg/kg/day appropriate HC- patient . The important AEs associate increase serum creatinine liver enzymes . The study limit pretreatment patient phlebotomy prior deferasirox study ; addition , many patient mild iron overload . For reason , see argument use high dose study , therefore choose start deferasirox dose 10 mg/kg/day HC- patient . In recent study , 24 heavily transfuse MDS patient enrol receive 52 week deferasirox therapy . Deferasirox well tolerate effectively reduce LIC , labile plasma iron s-ferritin patient complete 24 52 week therapy , despite ongoing receipt red blood cell transfusion . In addition reduce long-term toxicity iron overload , chelation therapy show beneficial effect hematopoiesis small proportion MDS patient . One ongoing study compare deferasirox placebo find Cochrane search carry June 2010 . Pharmacokinetics deferasirox . Deferasirox ( Exjade® ) bivalent iron chelator take orally tablet , per day . It readily absorb reach peak concentration blood 1 2 hour . The half-life 12 17 hour , effective level active chelator maintain blood 24 hour . The drug eliminate via hepatobiliary system . The dose varies 10 mg/kg/day patient mild iron overload 30 mg/kg/day patient overt iron toxicity . Adverse event ( AEs ) deferasirox . The frequent adverse clinical event gastrointestinal disturbance skin rash . The frequent laboratory side effect mild increase serum creatinine liver transaminase . The adverse event part report patient transfusional iron overload . In HC patient data scarce due study perform group . Other common AEs include headache , constipation , abdominal distension , dyspepsia , pruritus , proteinuria . Less common AEs include anxiety , sleep disorder , dizziness , early cataract , maculopathy , hear loss , pharyngolaryngeal pain , gastrointestinal hemorrhage , gastric ulcer , duodenal ulcer , gastritis , oesophagitis , hepatitis , cholelithiasis , pigmentation disorder , renal tubulopathy , glycosuria , pyrexia , edema , fatigue . Adverse reaction report post-marketing experience include pancytopenia , hypersensitivity reaction , hepatic failure , leukocytoclastic vasculitis , urticaria , erythema multiforme , alopecia , acute renal failure , tubulointerstitial nephritis , gallstone relate biliary disorder , elevation liver transaminase , hepatic failure . Any adverse event record subject 's Case Report Form ( CRF ) . Study design .
