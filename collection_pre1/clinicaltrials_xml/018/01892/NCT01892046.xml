	<detailed_description>Heat shock protein 90 ( Hsp90 ) chaperone proteins stabilize well 200 different know client protein help fold correctly take rightful position cell . Inhibitors chaperone protein Hsp90 current interest central role Hsp90 maturation maintenance numerous protein critical tumor cell viability growth . SNX-5422 pro-drug SNX-2112 , potent , highly selective , small-molecule inhibitor molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 ( Hsp90 ) . The study determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) SNX-5422 combine carboplatin plus paclitaxel select solid tumor assess safety efficacy SNX-5422 alone dose MTD maintenance therapy select solid tumor treatment .</detailed_description>
