	<brief_summary>The purpose study find effect , good bad , Optune device patient meningioma . This study do currently prove effective medical treatment progressive meningioma fail surgery and/or radiation . The study use experimental device call Optune . Optune `` experimental '' approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) type tumor , although approve different type brain tumor .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically proven recurrent WHO grade II ( atypical ) grade III ( anaplastic ) intracranial supratentorial meningioma . MSKCC central review histology require . Unequivocal evidence tumor progression MRI without contrast perfusion ( CT scan MRI contraindicate ) . The scan must perform within 14 day registration . Patients must stable decrease dose steroid least 5 day prior baseline image Patients recent resection recurrent disease must recover effect surgery start treatment least 28 day surgery . Patients must measurable disease , define least 1cm x 1 cm contrast enhance disease . Patients must receive prior radiotherapy meningioma . Patients may receive standard external beam radiation , interstitial brachytherapy , radiosurgery combination . An interval &gt; 4 week ( 28 day ) must elapse completion radiotherapy study entry must subsequent evidence tumor progression . Patients prior interstitial brachytherapy stereotactic radiosurgery must confirmation true progressive disease rather radiation necrosis base PET , MRperfusion , MRspectroscopy , surgical documentation disease . If question , investigator discuss MSKCC PI . Prior therapy : limit number prior surgery , radiation therapy treatment , radiosurgery treatment , chemotherapy . All patient must able provide inform consent indicate aware investigational nature study . Patients must provide authorization release protect health information . Age &gt; = 18 year old Karnofsky performance status &gt; = 60 % 4 week ( 28 day ) radiation treatment , stereotactic radiosurgery , conventional surgery , chemotherapy . Life expectancy least 3 month Patients NF ( Neurofibromatosis ) eligible , may stable CNS tumor , schwannoma , acoustic neuroma , ependymoma , ONLY lesions stable size precede 6 month . Patients history cancer ( except nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma insitu cervix , unless complete remission therapy disease minimum 3 year ) . Concomitant use investigational drug . Concurrent treatment another clinical trial . Supportive care trial nontreatment trial ( i.e . Quality life ) allow . Pregnancy breast feed . Patients must surgically sterile , postmenopausal , agree use effective contraception period therapy . The definition effective contraception base judgment principal investigator designate associate . Male patient must surgically sterile agree effective contraception . Female patient child bear potential ( age 1155 ) must negative BHCG pregnancy test document within 14 day prior registration . Implanted medical device pacemaker , defibrillator , deep brain stimulator , vagus nerve stimulator , document significant arrhythmia discretion investigator . Evidence increase intracranial pressure ( midline shift &gt; 5mm , clinically significant papilledema , vomit nausea , reduce level consciousness ) . Infratentorial meningioma ( patient may infratentorial meningioma concurrent grow supratentorial meningioma serf target lesion ) Coagulopathy ( evidence PT APTT &gt; 1.5 time upper limit normal patient undergoing anticoagulation ) Thrombocytopenia ( platelet count &lt; 100x10^3/uL ) Neutropenia ( absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1x10^3/uL ) Severe acute infection Skull defect miss bone Ventricular shunt/catheter Presence foreign body intracranially bullet fragment</criteria>
