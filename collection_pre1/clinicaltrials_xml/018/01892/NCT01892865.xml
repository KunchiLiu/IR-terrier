	<brief_title>Use Predictive Modeling Improve Operating Room Scheduling Efficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal propose study address efficacy schedule methodology use regression-based predictive modeling system ( PMS ) calculate operative anesthetic time length . The investigator hypothesize compare traditional scheduling system ( TSS ) calculate operative length use historic mean , case allocation operate room use PMS improve schedule precision , increase operative volume increase OS personnel satisfaction , without adverse impact patient outcomes . The investigator evaluate hypothesis use randomized block design two operating room single surgical specialty total 100 operative day per arm .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>The requirement include day study procedure perform specific day previously perform hospital least 5 time year last three year . This rule encompass vast majority perform vascular procedure facility . Setting threshold minimum 5 case per year essential assure data available calculate expect length case either traditional predictive modeling system . If case perform day schedule imprecision suppose calculate use PMS model data exist , anticipated length case calculate use historic mean . Surgery cancellation first case disqualify day inclusion study . If cancellation occur last case sequence specific day particular intervention take . The anticipated end surgical day reset end last case take place , imprecision calculation perform describe . If cancellation occur one intermediate case , end operative day reset reflect removal cancel case . A day exclude study follow occur ( base historical data investigator anticipate 1015 % operative day meet exclusion criterion ) : Only one case schedule entire operative day An emergency case add first case , schedule case . The operative day fall major holiday week ( Thanksgiving , Christmas , New Year ) . The schedule time period tends fragment , cancellation rate high , case frequently perform backup team . All factor may distort finding . There unusual case schedule meet minimum requirement 5 previous operation yearly basis last three year . The first case day cancel</criteria>
