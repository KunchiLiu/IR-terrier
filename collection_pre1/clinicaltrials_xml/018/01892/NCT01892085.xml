	<brief_summary>Compelling evidence exists breast milk help protect premature infant prematurity-specific morbidity . Unfortunately , mother premature infant often exhibit delayed lactogenesis stage II ( milk `` come '' ) decrease breast milk production . Several study link early initiation breast milk expression follow delivery great milk production . However , none conclusively determine optimal timing breast milk expression . As result mother continue struggle inadequate breast milk production . This study follow 180 mother premature infant 6 week follow delivery test Earlier initiation breast milk expression follow delivery associate ( 1 ) early lactogenesis stage II , ( 2 ) great volume breast milk production first 6 week , ( 3 ) improve short-term infant health outcome ( 4 ) woman deliver early gestation decrease milk production later lactogenesis stage II . Following stratification accord gestational age infant ( 23-27 week vs. 28-32 week ) , eligible woman randomly assign one three group instruct start mechanically express r breast , either first hour , 1-3 hour 3-6 hour follow delivery . The timing lactogenesis stage II document , volume breast milk produce continue measure first 6 week follow delivery discharge . Infant nutritional outcome measure throughout 6-week study . The impact difference time initiation milk expression follow delivery time lactogenesis stage II , milk volume , short term nutritional outcome , amount breast milk feeding discharge , impact gestational age milk volume lactogenesis stage II determine .</brief_summary>
