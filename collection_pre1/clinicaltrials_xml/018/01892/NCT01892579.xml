	<brief_title>Reducing Agitation People With Dementia : Customized Activity Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 5 million Americans Alzheimer 's disease relate dementia , progressive irreversible neurodegenerative condition , affect also close 15 million family caregiver ( CG ) . A hallmark disease one significant challenge dementia care neuropsychiatric symptom ( NPS ) agitation disable frequently occur . It associate increase health care cost , reduce life quality , heighten caregiver burden , disease acceleration nursing home placement . Treatment typically involve pharmacologic agent ; however , best modestly effective , carry serious risk include mortality , may reduce family distress . Recently issue position statement medical organization suggest nonpharmacologic strategy first-line treatment . Nevertheless , nonpharmacological strategy agitation remain understudied . We propose Phase III efficacy trial test novel 8-session patient-centric intervention , Customized Activity Program ( CAP ) . We test CAP use randomize two-group parallel design 250 people dementia ( PwD ) CGs ( dyad ) randomly assign CAP control intervention equivalent in-home attention social contact . CAP assess PwDs ' preserved capability , deficit , previous role , habit , interest home environment activity develop match PwD profile . Families train implement activity modify future decline . A pilot phase 60 dyad show clinically meaningful statistically significant reduction agitation , adverse effect . Our primary study aim evaluate effect CAP 3 month agitation ( Hypothesis : PwD TAP low caregiver rat agitation compare control intervention condition . Three secondary aim evaluate : 1 ) 6-month effect TAP agitation quality life PwD ( Hypothesis : PwD CAP manifest low caregiver rat subscale frequency severity score 6 month good quality life compare PwD control intervention ) ; 2 ) Immediate effect CAP 3 6 month CG wellbeing , time spend provide care ( Hypothesis : CGs receive CAP report enhance wellbeing less time caregiving compare control intervention ( 3 6 month ) ; 3 ) Cost effectiveness CAP express incremental cost outcome achieve form CG burden reduction willingness pay burden reduction ( 3 6 month ; Hypothesis : CAP cost effective compare control intervention test occasion ) . Five exploratory aim evaluate treatment effect psychotropic medication use troublesome behavior , effect differ cognitive status , CGs receive CAP use activity 6 month frequency , time gain spent , frequency/duration treatment activity use affect outcomes . If proven efficacious cost effective , CAP potential transform clinical practice offer proven nonpharmacologic treatment agitation PwDs home . This trial address critical clinical need public health priority identify recent legislative activity . Objectives Our primary study aim evaluate immediate effect CAP agitation 3 month . Our hypothesis PwD receive CAP manifest low caregiver rat frequency severity score Neuropsychiatric Inventory- ( NPI ) subscales agitation+aggression ( 21 item ) , compare control intervention . Three secondary aim evaluate : 1 ) effect CAP 6 month agitation quality life patient . Hypothesis : Patients receive CAP manifest low caregiver rat frequency severity score NPI-C agitation + aggression subscales well quality life comparison patient receive control intervention baseline 6 month ; 2 ) effect CAP 3 6 month CG wellbeing , ( burden , skill acquisition , efficacy use activity ) , time spend provide care . Hypothesis : Caregivers receive CAP report enhance wellbeing less time caregiving compare control intervention 3 6 month ; 3 ) cost effectiveness CAP express incremental cost outcome achieve form CG burden reduction willingness pay burden reduction 3 6 month . Hypothesis : CAP cost effective compare control intervention test occasion . To understand treatment effect enhance translation , propose exploratory aim evaluate : 1 ) Impact CAP psychotropic medication use treatment control condition 3 6 month compare proportion PwD require dose increase incident use psychotropic medication ( negative outcome ) proportion PwD reduce eliminate medication use agitation improve ( positive outcome ) ; 2 ) Whether treatment effect agitation differs 3 6 month cognitive status ; 3 ) Whether CAP reduces total NPI score rat CGs 3 6 month , 4 ) If 6-months CGs receive CAP use prescribed activity frequency ; CGs use personal time gain ; 5 ) Extent treatment receipt enactment ( frequency/duration session use activity ) affect NPI-C score . If proven efficacious cost effective , CAP potential transform current paradigm dementia care rely primarily pharmacologic management agitation . It offer clinicians family prove nonpharmacologic approach enhance quality life replicate , reimbursement potential , resonate medical treatment guideline health care reform effort aim reduce pharmacologic use help old adult care home . Background This propose trial specifically build upon extends pilot phase test propose intervention 60 dyad ( NIMH R21 grant # R21 MH069425 ) . This pilot phase evaluate program acceptability , identified behavior responsive , evaluated magnitude change NPS CG burden . Dyads interview baseline , randomize intervention wait-list control , reassess 4-months . After 4-months , wait-list control group receive intervention reevaluate 8 month ( within group comparison 4 8 month ) . Main outcome : At 4-months , statistically significant treatment effect find frequency NPS overall ( p=.010 ; Cohen 's d=.72 ) use 16-item Agitated Behavior Inventory dementia . Specifically , 77 % CGs treatment report improvement NPS compare 40 % wait-list group ; 23 % treatment report worsen NPS compare 60 % wait-lists . As untreated agitation worsens time significant proportion patient , pilot data suggests worsen agitation less common intervention group ; intervention also appear help reduce likelihood worsen patient whose agitation destine worsen without treatment . It appear unlikely intervention cause adverse effect worsening . However , possibility , list consent form possible risk . Reductions intervention group also occur specific behavior reflect agitation behavior concern CG sample ; shadow ( p=.003 , Cohen 's d=3.10 ) , repetitive questioning ( p=.023 , Cohen 's d=1.22 ) , slight increase ( worsen ) find control group . As show Figure 2 , also find statistically significant reduction prevalence caregiver report agitation ( p=.014 , Cohen 's d=.75 ) ; 14.8 % treatment vs. 44.8 % control report PwD agitation 4 month . A similar pattern find argumentation ( p=.010 , Cohen 's d=.77 ) . Also , CG treatment report PwD demonstrate well engagement ( p=.029 , Cohen 's d=.61 ) , pleasure ( p=.045 , Cohen 's d=.690 ) , improve ability keep positively busy ( p=.017 , Cohen 's d=.71 ) . Equally significant reduction CG objective burden measure NIH REACH vigilance item hour `` thing '' PwD ( p=.005 , Cohen 's d=1.14 ) ; hour `` duty '' ( p=.001 , Cohen 's d=1.01 ) intervention report 5 hour less control report spending 3 hour duty . Control group participant demonstrate similar benefit 4 8 month . Medication Use : Of 60 PwD , 78.3 % anti-dementia medication ( cholinesterase inhibitor memantine ) , 32 % psychotropic medication NPS , 45 % antidepressant study entry . Use medication impact primary outcome ( e.g. , frequency behavioral symptom ) . In separate regression analysis , enter baseline use/non-use 3 medication-types ( e.g. , anti-depressant , psychotropic medication , anti-dementia medication ) predictor find impact treatment outcome effect size . This show medication common , yet NPS persist . It also suggest importance assure PwD stabilize dose prior enter trial treatment effect confound medication use . Cognitive Status : We find difference treatment effect cognitive status : high ( &gt; 10 ) low ( &lt; 10 ) MMSE group benefit similarly regard reduction behavioral frequency . However , high MMSE group also show reduction number behavior occur 4 month ( p=.028 ) . Cost : We also calculate preliminary incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) , express cost bring one additional unit benefit measure CG hour per day `` thing '' hour per day `` duty '' decision tree Monte Carlo analyse test robustness economic model . Average intervention cost $ 941.63 per dyad . ICER show CGs treatment save one extra hour per day `` thing '' cost $ 2.37 per day ; one extra hour per day `` duty '' cost $ 1.10 per day . Monte Carlo show intervention cost-effective 79.2 % time `` thing '' 79.6 % time `` duty . '' Varying cost assumption change cost-effectiveness . In summary , pilot phase demonstrate proof concept ; high acceptability PwD CGs , preliminary positive outcome , preliminary cost effectiveness , benefit PwD agitation adverse event . It also provide guidance trial design consideration include importance assure dyad medication stabilize dose prior study enrollment evaluate relationship cognitive status outcome . Our propose trial advance pilot phase : ) test efficacy large , diverse sample well characterized diagnosis , disease severity , behavior use standard clinical assessment , b ) compare CAP control intervention condition receive equivalent attention social contact , control unknown effect empathy , validation attention provide CAP ; c ) examine cost effectiveness prospectively societal perspective , ) evaluate broad range outcome moderator ( dose , intensity , activity use ) support future translational effort .</detailed_description>
