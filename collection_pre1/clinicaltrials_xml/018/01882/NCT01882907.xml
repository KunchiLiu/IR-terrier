	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Study Compare Vildagliptin Pioglitazone Adding Metformin Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) chronic progressive disease characterize hyperglycemia result pancreatic islet dysfunction . Presently available oral antihypoglycemic drug improve glycemic control short term , none show stop progressive decline beta cell function contribute deterioration glycemic control time . Pathophysiology T2DM know tissue resistance insulin progressive beta cell failure . Which one attribute first unclear , non-obese T2DM patient often show normal fast plasma glucose ( FPG ) postprandial plasma glucose ( PPG ) level high reduce lack normal compensatory insulin secretion . In Korea , 80 % T2DM non-obese type ( BMI &gt; = 27 ) observe basal insulin level compensatory insulin secretion reaction reduce normal healthy population . Based , metformin establish first line treatment type 2 diabetes , act primarily enhance hepatic peripheral insulin sensitivity . However , become increasingly apparent many patient require combination agent attain optimal glycemic control . Better understand incretin effect pathophysiology T2DM recently lead development new oral hypoglycemic agent . Vildagliptin potent highly selective dipeptidyl peptidase ( DPP ) -IV inhibitor improve islet function increase pancreatic alpha beta cell responsiveness glucose . Studies patient T2DM show vildagliptin significantly reduce HbA1c FPG level baseline induce weight gain incidence hypoglycemia low . In addition , study rodents support effort vildagliptin beta cell remodel . The thiazolidinediones effective reduce HbA1C obese T2DM patient know thiazolidinedione delay beta cell failure . But recently , thiazolidinediones find associated decrease bone mineral density raise risk myocardial infarct cardiovascular relate mortality . Thus , need new class blood glucose lower drug potential delay prevent progression T2DM .</detailed_description>
