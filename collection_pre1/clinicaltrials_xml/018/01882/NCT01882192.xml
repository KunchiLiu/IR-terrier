	<brief_summary>The primary research question : 1 ) Does plan condition improve adherence regular physical activity compare control condition six month ? Hypothesis : Adherence high plan condition comparison standard physical activity education condition . The effect may wane time initial measurement period outcome remain significantly high six month . Secondary Research Questions 1 . Does plan condition improve motivational , health-related quality life , health-related fitness outcome compare control condition six month ? Hypothesis : The planning condition affect intention underlie motif ( theory plan behaviour construct ) physical activity effect behavior tie initial intention well behavioural action ( i.e. , behavioural regulation ) enhance motivation . Health-related fitness quality life , however , high plan condition comparison standard physical activity education intervention condition . The effect may wane time initial measurement period outcome remain significantly high six month plan condition compare standard physical activity education group . 2 . Can group difference among motivational , behavioural , health-related fitness outcome explain mediation model ? Hypothesis : The covariance assign condition ( planning , education ) use/adherence explain planning use behavioural regulation strategy ( i.e. , manipulation check ) . In turn , covariance plan behavioural regulation strategy health-related outcome explain physical activity adherence among condition . 3 . Can motivational variable predict adherence ? Do differ condition ? Hypothesis : The approach test Ajzen 's theory plan behavior , extend concept active planning . Affective attitude perceive behavioural control predict intention , intention predict plan plan predict adherence across condition . 4 . Is intergenerational , seasonal , gender difference across primary outcome assign condition ? Hypothesis : Children show great adherence planning condition parent . No difference gender season hypothesize exploratory research question limit research present make definitive statement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Obesity rapidly become one serious public health challenge century , especially consider overweight obese child likely stay obese adulthood high risk develop chronic disease young age . The need change modifiable risk factor associate obesity chronic diseases paramount . Physical activity associate reduction several chronic disease adult , include breast cancer , colorectal cancer , CVD , stroke , high blood pressure , type 2 diabetes , osteoporosis , hypertension . In child 5 17 year old , physical activity high physical fitness help guard high blood pressure , high blood cholesterol , metabolic syndrome , low bone density , depression , injury , obesity . Unfortunately Canada , well half adult population , almost half child population , active enough reap health benefit . Children spend considerable time within care parent , indeed parent appear 'gatekeepers ' child experience family time . Our review 34 intergenerational study show parental support synonymous physical activity child . Thus , focus parent mean change youth physical activity appear necessity . At present , physical activity intervention focus family limit result negligible change . A recent review study demonstrate low success produce behavior change - considerably lower comparable adult literature . The author suggest focus research attention need place family order improve current practice physical activity promotion . Our pilot study [ 15 ] , serve template research proposal , demonstrate focused planning , , , , overcome expect barrier follow prompt cue result significant change physical activity standard persuasion/education approach . The following proposal extension line successful research improvement methodological rigor sample generalizability use pilot study . Target population : The targeted population inactive family within Greater Victoria Area , British Columbia . Sample size : A total 160 family recruit ( n=80 per group ) . Intervention : The intervention follow prior work conduct successful pilot trial . The standard ( comparison group ) package consist Canada 's family guide physical activity guideline recommend 60 minute activity day bouts short five ten minute child breakdown way family achieve physical activity ( structure , unstructured , endurance , strength , activity , le 60 minute sustain sedentary activity , reduce screen view 30 min per day ) commensurate guide . This include new insert CSEP . The guide also contain argument information benefit physical activity . The intervention condition receive guideline comparison condition also provide family physical activity plan material . This material include skill train content ( workbook plan family physical activity ) practical material create plan ( i.e. , colourful dry erase wall calendar family activity fridge magnet ) . The skill train material planning base several stream prior work adult physical activity literature . Families instruct plan `` , '' `` , '' `` , '' `` '' physical activity perform commensurate creation implementation intentions/action planning . The workbook , however , also focus problem solve barrier physical activity akin cop plan traditional goal setting . The design material create pilot study feature graphic design colour image represent family physical activity .</detailed_description>
