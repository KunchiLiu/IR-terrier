	<detailed_description>The risk colon cancer patient longstanding ulcerative colitis exceed rectum increase therefore patient enrol surveillance program eight year diagnosis . Surveillance endoscopy advise 8 10 year diagnosis ulcerative colitis . The first decade every 3 year , second decade every 2 year thereafter every year Until today , official international guideline endoscopic screen patient ulcerative colitis advise take 4 random biopsy every 10 centimeter ( minimum 32 ) suspect visible lesion use standard white light endoscopy . These guideline merely base consensus expert opinion meeting rather evidence base . However , study show sensitivity detection dysplasia colonoscopy patient ulcerative colitis significantly enhance use chromo-endoscopy . These study use methylene blue indigo carmine contrast agent without high magnification endoscopy . Chromo-endoscopy guide targeted biopsy significantly reduce number biopsy procedure detect neoplastic lesion . It therefore conclude colonoscopy chromo-endoscopy guide biopsy efficient cost saving . Chromo-endoscopy targeted biopsy alternative white light endoscopy random biopsy every 10cm . The European Crohn Colitis association suggest use methylene blue indigo carmine chromoendoscopy alternative random biopsy appropriately trained endoscopists superior random biopsy detection rate neoplastic lesion In study want compare chromoendoscopy target biopsy gold standard new new endoscopic image technique call virtual chromoendoscopy . From 2005 new endoscopic image modality commercialize generally available gastroenterologist . They claim theoretical advantage comparison standard white light high resolution video endoscopy . These new technique call virtual chromoendoscopy ( VC ) . There three different system develop three major competitor endoscopic equipment : Olympus , Pentax Fujinon . Narrow-Band Imaging ( NBI ) develop Olympus inc. selectively use certain wavelength visible light lead shift excitation spectrum towards blue light . The intensity blue bandwidth also enhance . This lead superficial penetration emit light mucosa intestine enhancement superficial structure ( e.g . irregularity , small flat lesion polyp ) small superficial mucosal vessel ( indicative neoplasia ) . The first study use NBI Barrett 's esophagus demonstrate additional value NBI detection neoplastic lesion comparable chromo-endoscopy ( Kara et al. , 2005 ) . However NBI time save easy perform chromo-endoscopy need additionally spray dye onto mucosa . In standard population screen study , NBI show aid detection characterization polyp colon . In particular presence brownish mesh capillary network high diagnostic value prediction neoplastic nature lesion . In recent tandem study white light endoscopy compare NBI 48 patient longstanding UC additional benefit NBI . In 25 patient first endoscoped white light 8 dysplastic lesion find . After NBI image another 7 lesion find . In 23 patient first image NBI 7 lesion find additional 8 white light endoscopy ( Van den Broek FJ et al 2011 . The Fujinon Intelligent Chromo-Endoscopy ( FICE ) system use similar theoretical principal NBI achieve via use post hoc computer algorithm , apply different filter store endoscopic image enable theoretically endless number combination filter use . Currently 10 different spectrum filter use . There predefined setting visualization colonic mucosa . There previous data compare white light endoscopy FICE detection dysplasia longstanding ulcerative colitis . Finally , Pentax release new high definition endoscopy system 2007 , I-scan system , also allow post hoc modification image . On one hand , surface enhancement enable good highlight mucosal change . Spectral modification allow apply different mode analogy FICE system . For instance p-mode pattern recognition help accentuate epithelial feature . The TE-mode help assess vasculature gastrointestinal mucosa . Recently new filter develop colon mode , specifically design colon . In one study VC I-scan TE-mode compare CE standard white light endoscopy 69 patient . In VC CE mode 11 dysplastic lesion find ( Hoffman et al 2010 ) . Data improvement detection dysplasia lack . Adjustment light spectrum usually combine well high image resolution new generation endoscope . Fujinon Pentax use call super-CCD increase pixel resolution scope 1.300.000 1.400.000 respectively combine DVI output signal . Olympus opt improved video resolution incorporate high definition television ( HDTV ) late processor . These new image technique theoretical advantage extendedly use sale purpose however far proven ulcerative colitis patient . We want test clinical use screen neoplastic lesion patient long stand ulcerative colitis . The scientific clinical relevance study clear . If NBI and/or FICE and/or I-scan good detection rate chromo-endoscopy , latter replace virtual chromo-endoscopy . Even detection NBI and/or FICE and/or I-scan statistically different standard chromo-endoscopy , still replace latter technically easy use . If however technique low adenoma detection rate classical chromo-endoscopy able show place technique detection UC related neoplasia , despite theoretical advantage . Because multicenter character study , availability one system hospital , test difference three modality classical chromoendodoscopy . The endoscopic procedure much different standard endoscopic procedure patient advise undergo accord good clinical practice . The bowel preparation similar normal colonoscopy , perform either home endoscopy department . The endoscope use study include H180Q series Olympus , 5000 series Fujinon HD series Pentax . They different term design size compare standard colonoscopy commercially available . Patients randomize one follow technique : 1 . Chromo-endoscopy methylene blue 0,1 % ( group A-C-E ) An Olympus spray catheter use biopsy channel endoscope apply dye , saline solution methylene blue concentration 0.1 % . This technique already validate previous study . Besides extra time need die entire colon mucosa , manipulation need technique . Moreover , time need dye recover chromo-endoscopy guided biopsy take instead random biopsy throughout colon , normally also require considerable amount time . Previous study use chromo-endoscopy versus conventional screen colonoscopy show significant difference total procedure time . The endoscope use differ one use randomization arm include either Olympus H180Q colonoscope , Fujinon EC 590 ZW/M colonoscope Pentax 3890i colonoscope . All three endoscope CE approve commercially available . 2 . Narrow band image HDTV ( Group B ) This technique involve Olympus H180Q colonoscope CE approve commercially available . The procedure involve normal white light endoscopy progression scope . Once caecum reach entire procedure perform NBI modus . This influence side effect patient NBI modus switch push button scope . 3 . Fujinon Intelligent Color Enhancement ( FICE ) super CCD chip ( Group D ) This technique involve Fujinon EC 590ZW/M colonoscope CE approve commercially available . The procedure involve normal white light endoscopy progression scope . Once caecum reach entire procedure perform FICE modus nÂ° 4 . This influence side effect patient FICE modus switch push button scope . 4 . I-scan High Definition colonoscope ( group F ) This technique involve PENTAX EC3890Fi colonoscope CE approve commercially available . The procedure involve normal white light endoscopy progression scope . Once caecum reach entire procedure perform TE- modus ( Tissue enhancement mode ) surface enhancement medium ( range low-medium-high ) . This influence side effect patient c- modus switch push button scope . Only targeted biopsy visible mucosal abnormality chromo-endoscopy , NBI , FICE I-scan endoscopy take . This concordance standard approach chromo-endoscopy direct screen colonoscopy ulcerative colitis . The disposable biopsy forceps commercially available ( Boston Scientific ) differ one use normal endoscopic procedure . Power calculation A power analysis perform detect statistical significance group A B , group C D group E F. In previous study dysplasia find three time often use CE compare white light endoscopy : 32/84 versus 10/81 patient . This wil give increase approximate 10 30 percent . It expect study group percentage dysplasia equal . Inclusion 67 patient group allow detect 20 % increase dysplasia 10 30 % compare white light endoscopy power 80 % ( beta error 0.2 ; alpha error 0.05 ) . We expect include total ( 67 x 6 = ) 402 patient study . 5.5 Co-variables Multiple factor use co-variables - Age - Duration disease - Existence PSC - Use medication - Mesalazine/Sulfazalazine - Thiopurines - Biologicals</detailed_description>
