	<brief_title>Study Low Level Laser Light Therapy Improve Blood Circulation People With Chronic Heel Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy blood circulation important overall health well-being , strong steady local blood flow delivers fresh nutrient cell prevents accumulation waste material within cell necessary maintain healthy cell function . Conversely , poor local blood circulation cause numerous acute chronic health problem , manifest symptom pain , numbness , weakness swelling , exacerbate symptom co-existing acute chronic condition . Chronic condition may result poor blood circulation untreated persists long period time include varicose vein , kidney damage , stroke heart attack . Memory loss , frequent headache , dizzy spell slow mental response also result . Therefore , improve local blood circulation significant positive implication overall health well-being individual improving , relieve prevent symptom long-term complication poor blood circulation . Treatment improve blood circulation include simple option change dietary exercise habit , alternative treatment acupuncture herbal remedy . Medications may prescribe assist contributory condition high blood pressure cholesterol . In progressed case , surgical option angioplasty bypass may perform treat narrow blocked artery . However , less invasive option usually minimally effective , medication risk side-effects surgical procedure invasive carry significant procedural risk potential complication . The purpose study evaluate efficacy low level laser therapy mean increase local blood circulation relate reduce chronic heel pain arise plantar fasciitis simple , non-invasive risk-free . Low level laser therapy believe effect various physiological mechanism change include improved blood flow increase cell metabolism , advance healing , anti-inflammatory action stimulation immune system . The laser direct light energy body 's cell . The cell convert light energy chemical energy promote natural heal pain relief . The laser also allow photon enter tissue become absorbed cell mitochondrion within photonic energy convert electromagnetic energy form adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) . This additional ATP energy cell use trigger positive physiological response body increase cell metabolism development muscle tissue collagen , improvement blood circulation , stimulation tissue repair , wound heal stimulation nervous immune system .</detailed_description>
