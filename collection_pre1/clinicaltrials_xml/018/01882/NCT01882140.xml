	<brief_summary>The high incidence burn injury mortality morbidity well high economic impact associate type injury justify need develop new technology treatment burn patient . Electrical stimulation wound heal resource increasingly used routine physical therapist , disadvantage needing mean wet contact electrode injury . The resource use therapeutic heal conventional electrical stimulation low intensity capacitive field , technique physical therapy intervention commercially available Brazil . This new technology seem significant physiological effect tissue repair use treatment chronic wound heal difficulty . The objective analyze effect electrical stimulation low intensity capacitive field heal skin burn . Patients gender age 18 year burns , evaluate treated Emergency Unit Hospital Faculty Medicine Ribeirão Preto , University São Paulo . The stimulation initiate within 24 hour surgery perform graft hold daily 60 minute patient 's stay complete healing skin . The electromagnetic field place care burn area / donor skin graft , interfere departmental procedure . Will perform photographic record standardize wound digital camera , quantified computer program . Expected reduce period hospitalization thus lower cost treatment , possibility improve quality life patient .</brief_summary>
