	<brief_title>Nuedexta Treatment-Resistant Major Depression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately one-third patient major depressive disorder achieve adequate symptom control despite series multiple treatment trial currently available antidepressant medication ( example serotonin-selective reuptake inhibitor ) . This group patient - represent treatment-resistant depression ( TRD ) - account alarmingly high public health burden signifies critical area need pharmaceutical treatment development . While current treatment slow act partially effective , new basic clinical research focus glutamate system yield promise new avenue novel drug discovery . Ketamine - glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist - demonstrate several study bring rapid robust antidepressant effect , even patient suffer TRD . Ketamine limit treatment TRD need intravenous administration potential untoward medical psychiatric adverse effect . There urgent need , therefore , identify well-tolerated , orally available compound target NMDA receptor novel treatment approach TRD . The current project aim test safety , tolerability efficacy Nuedexta - contain NMDA antagonist dextromethorphan .</detailed_description>
