	<brief_summary>Despite robust literature benefit exercise cancer survivor , research date fall two primary area - aerobic exercise breast cancer survivor . The focus aerobic train alone concern resistance training critical building muscle mass necessary maintain physical function . However , concern raise potential high tolerated adverse event rate resistance training , particularly unsupervised , despite history safe use resistance training chronically diseased patient population . The aim pilot study demonstrate feasibility , safety quality life benefit home-based resistance-training program among colorectal cancer survivor . The investigator recruit n=30 men woman stage I-III colon cancer . Participants randomize home-based exercise intervention combine aerobic resistance exercise . Control arm participant receive home-based meditation program .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator recruit n=30 patient stage I-III colorectal cancer randomize 12-week resistance training intervention Theraband exist evidence- base material attention control use meditation intervention . Using electronic survey tool , patient complete baseline questionnaire key outcome ( quality life , fatigue , side effect ) potential confounders consent medical record review . These also assess via 4 week post randomization 12 week post randomization . Participants intervention group receive one-time person instruction exercise derive exist evidence base home-based resistance training program older adult cancer survivor . They send home book demonstrate exercise , log set appropriate resistance band . Weekly follow-up call occur duration intervention update call result provide colon cancer clinic nurse care integrate . Participants attention control group mail meditation CD . Follow-up control group parallel intervention group , weekly call .</detailed_description>
