	<brief_title>Monosialoganglioside ( GM1 ) Preventing Neurotoxicity Induced Cisplatin Contained Chemotherapy NSCLC Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>NSCLC patient receive cisplatin-based doublet chemotherapy include trial . Patients randomly assign experimental group control group base segment block randomize method . After enrollment , patient complete four six chemotherapy GM1/placebo injection . During 3w per cycle chemotherapy , cisplatin injection conduct D1/D1-3 , GM1/placebo ( 80mg+250ml N.S ) inject D0 D3 . Neurotoxicity evaluation quality life ( FACT-NTX EROTC scale ) assessment conduct every cycle 3w/11w/19w chemotherapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Cytological histological confirmation nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) diagnosis , single sputum cytology diagnosis accept Expected survival period 3 month Enough blood function reservation : absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) 2 x 10E9/L high ; platelet count 100 x 109 /L high ; hemoglobin 9 g/dL high . Enough liver function reservation : total bilirubin less upper limit normal ; AST ALT acuities less 2.5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; Alkaline phosphatase 5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) less . Clinical doctor identify patient suitable standard dos ganglioside drug therapy , expect time medication least six week Within 4 week treatment , receive adverse reaction drug may cause similar neurotoxicity ; 18 week , receive platinumbased drug chemical treatment . No 1 degree peripheral nervous system diseases exist enrollment , also symptom disease could affect adverse reaction neurotoxicity pathological . Ca n't accept adverse reaction may prevent neurotoxicity treatment care enrollment . Sign inform consent form . Patients poor general condition , PS score 2 point Women pregnancy lactation Patients ( male female ) fertility possibility willing adopt effective contraception With neurological dysfunction cause inaccurate record occurrence neurotoxicity severity Known assignment product test drug allergic agent composition Doctors think inappropriate patient ganglioside medication estimate time le 6 week Active infection ( determine researcher ) According researcher 's judgment , serious disease endanger safety patient , may prevent patient complete study Have clear history neurological psychiatric disorder , include epilepsy dementia</criteria>
