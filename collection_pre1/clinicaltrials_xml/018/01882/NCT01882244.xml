Deficits attention , work memory , aspects goal-directed cognition affect broad range pursuit everyday life , among prevalent long-lasting consequence brain injury . The objective research develop remotely deployed training tool target common , persistent debilitate cognitive function affect traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) ; test potential effect intervention compare effect active comparison intervention ; determine neurocognitive functional effect computer-assisted remote training .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Remotely Deployed TBI Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective research develop remotely deploy computer-assisted training intervention , include software tool training protocol , address cognitive neurologic impairment associate TBI , improve cognitive functioning thus increase quality life . These tool build strong foundation cognitive neuroscience , empiric evidence advance clinical care , address practical issue distance therapist/patient time limitation . This research involve two phase : User test Assessment/Training . Assessment Training Assessments : The potential effect remotely administer training assess use neuropsychological test complex attention , executive function memory , test function challenge real world situation involve multitasking goal management , questionnaires assess cognitive emotional functioning personal life . Neurocognitive test functional evaluation session take 2- 3 hour , 5 hour combine . The subject free take break throughout test session , take place one two day . Subjects participate assessment four time ( Baseline , 6-8 week ; 12-16 week ; 18-24 week ) , 20 hour ( 5 hour x 4 time point ) . The investigator anticipate 30 subject participate assessment train . Experimental Intervention I : The Pathfinder training protocol include supervise attentional regulation training session , either in-person via VA 's video tele-health ( VTEL ) system , home play computer game . Trainers also call subject supervise session ( ) check patient initiate home play ( help problem-solve provide motivation , necessary ) , ( ii ) encourage transfer generalization learning , per protocol . Home play configure allow 35 minute play day supervise session . After end home game play , additional time allow continued practice application train skill personal life . Experimental Intervention II : Brain Health Education consist train session , either in-person via VA 's video tele-health ( VTEL ) system , home play computer game . The Brain Health Education protocol base curriculum already develop , design facilitate learn TBI-relevant information . Trainers also call subject supervise session ( ) check patient initiate home play ( help problem-solve provide motivation , necessary ) . Home play configure allow 35 minute play day supervise session . After end home game play , additional time allow continued practice review TBI-relevant information . Subjects participate either one experimental intervention , match time commitment . Participation intervention include weekly in-person remote 1-2 hour session trainer period 6-16 week . In addition weekly training session , study activity include 15 minute weekly telephone contact trainer 35 minute day play computerized game home period . Therefore , total training time range approximately 43-93 hour , depend whether participation include one intervention .</detailed_description>
