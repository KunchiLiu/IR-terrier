	<brief_summary>Patients survive stroke often left arm use . One reason muscle affect stroke become overactive . This known spasticity . Such unwanted muscle overactivity , leave untreated poorly manage , lead limb deformity . For example , wrist finger arm affect spasticity become stiff curl fist hand use functional purpose . Palm hygiene become difficult patient find deformity unsightly painful . Botulinum toxin ( BT ) show reduce muscle overactivity license purpose . In current practice treatment often use last line defence . Although BT reduce muscle overactivity , inject use current protocol , seem little impact recovery function and/or treat limb deformity pain . If BT give early stage stroke , i.e . soon muscle overactivity observe , able treat spasticity may prevent limb deformity pain develop . We may also able assist recovery arm movement patient would otherwise regain . In addition benefiting patient , prevention secondary complication early treatment may reduce cost long term care NHS . We hope discover plan provide early treatment BT effective current approach . If demonstrate treatment effective able introduce new method almost immediately within NHS collaboration doctor therapists actively treating patient condition .</brief_summary>
