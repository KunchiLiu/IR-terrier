	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well give docetaxel together lycopene work treat patient hormone-resistant prostate cancer previously treat chemotherapy . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Chemoprevention use certain drug , lycopene , keep cancer form . Giving docetaxel together lycopene may effective treatment prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel Plus Lycopene Castration Resistant , Chemotherapy-Na√Øve Prostate Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) response rate accord criterion Bubley , et al. , subject treat combination docetaxel lycopene . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine objective response rate ( ORR ) accord modify Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) criterion patient measurable disease , follow treatment docetaxel lycopene . II . To define time PSA progression , accord response criterion Scher , et al. , subject treat docetaxel lycopene . III . To determine safety tolerability lycopene combination docetaxel . IV . To determine effect docetaxel + lycopene therapy function insulin-like growth factor receptor ( IGFRI ) , select biomarkers , docetaxel blood level plasma peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( correlative study ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive docetaxel intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 2 lycopene orally ( PO ) daily day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 21days least 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
