	<detailed_description>A . Background Plantar fasciitis common foot complaint America , affect approximately 10 % people life time.9 It painful debilitate condition appear sedentary active population . A survey perform Foot Ankle Special Interest Group Orthopedic Section , APTA , find 100 % therapist report PF common foot condition see clinic . 9 Approximately one million patient visit physician diagnosis treatment plantar fasciitis.10 Chronic plantar fasciitis , previously think inflammatory condition cause repetitive microtearing plantar fascia , think degenerative condition.5 The plantar aponeurosis , fascia , function provide static support longitudinal arch dynamic shock absorption . It consist 3 band : lateral , medial , central . The central band originate medial tubercle calcaneus travel across metatarsal head phalanx toe.9 In acute stage , pain commonly localize origin medial central band plantar surface calcaneus.6 This pain usually classify sharp knife-like pain upon initial standing . The pain occurs period non-weight bearing often bad morning . Those chronic stage may report pain dull achy . Pain stage may also extend beyond medial tubercle , extend central lateral band . Pain stage usually subside minute walk see acute phase.6 Many factor contribute development plantar fasciitis . Anatomy , biomechanics environment factor contribute development condition.6 Pes planus , pes cavus foot , limited dorsiflexion , tight Achilles tendon , tight hamstring obesity fall beneath anatomical causation . Biomechanical factor include weak plantar flexor muscle excessive subtalar joint pronation . Environmental factor include weight bearing activity , foot wear trauma.6 Certain disease also place individual increase risk . These may include diabetes , peripheral vascular neuropathy , Paget 's disease , Reiter 's syndrome , autoimmune neurologic disorders.8 Diagnosis mostly make upon clinical assessment finding classify patient heel pain International Statistical Classification Diseases Related Health Problems category plantar fasciitis associate International Classification Functioning Disability Health impairment base category heel pain.9 To date , specific treatment choice patient plantar fasciitis . Multiple study conduct various conservative treatment technique accord Crawford et al 's Cochrane Review , `` There limited evidence upon base clinical practice . '' 1 The option include : modality , manual therapy , stretch , tap , night splint , steroid injection orthotic device . Of previous intervention , strong evidence support use orthotic device provide temporary relief symptoms.9 Traditional orthotic device design cast subtalar midtarsal joint neutral position . They hypothesize limit excessive pronation , optimize biomechanical load foot , load plantar fascia.10 Additionally , custom orthotics costly may require specialty service orthotist cast individual . Despite cost time-intensive manufacturing process , custom orthotics often worn life may prove ineffective 3 months.9 A recent pilot study propose benefit temporary foot orthoses cast equinos position plantar fasciitis treatment.2,3 As opposed traditional casting method subtalar midtarsal joint neutral , equinos position place patient 's foot full plantar flexion inversion . This cast position hypothesize put plantar fascia slacken position , therefore reduce weight-bearing damage tissue.2 Consequently , aim randomize control trial identify possible effectiveness temporary use inexpensive custom-made plantar fascia orthotic ( PFO ) , fabricate equinos position foot . B . Project Description Prior study commencement training session provide educate ensure investigator able perform examination , cast accurately provide instruction participant . All investigator also train distribution analysis outcome measure use study . The study begin subject complete medical screening questionnaire . All subject go formal physical examination conduct one investigator . Subjects meet criterion admission consent participate study , sign inform consent form , include study . Subjects assign control experimental group via random number generator . Subjects complete two outcome measure collect baseline data , Foot Ankle Ability Measure ( FAAM ) Numeric Pain Rating Scale ( NPRS ) . The FAAM show valid reliable self-reported outcome measure lower leg , ankle , foot function range musculoskeletal disorder physical therapy setting . The FAAM ask patient rate level difficulty several activity daily live sport specific activity . The NPRS ask patient rate intensity first step heel pain scale 0-10 , 0 equal pain 10 equal worst pain ever experience . Additionally , GRC show valid reliable method assess change quality life time . A Global Rating Change ( GRC ) collect throughout study ( baseline , two week , four week , twelve week , six month ) . Upon initial evaluation , researcher also complete Foot Posture Index ( FPI-6 ) subject classify static foot posture stand position . The FPI-6 look multiple bony landmark foot full weight-bearing position give landmark score base position stand . A total score produce describe patient 's foot type . Following collection baseline data , one researcher begin fabricate individual experimental group custom-made PFO . The custom-made PFO complete place subject 's foot equinos ( plantar flexed invert ) position . The custom-made PFO create Aqua-Plast cast material . After heat Aqua-Plast material , researcher drape material forearm ensure n't hot subject . When orthosis harden , subject place his/her shoe ( remove shoe liner ) . Researchers trim , stretch , pad orthosis need make sure completely comfortable . If orthosis rub otherwise find uncomfortable , rough edge reheat smoothed finger grinder use taper edge . Subjects tell come time make needed change . Full instruction construction custom-made PFO include . Control group subject ask wear faux orthotic construct soft material cushion , support , plantar fascia . Subjects ask wear either PFO faux orthotic time weight bear two week time frame initial treatment period . An exception make showering , subject instruct weight-bear lateral side foot avoid pronation pull plantar fascia . After two week , subject wean orthotic one week . Weaning include wear orthotic 8 hour per day , follow stretch program include Windlass ( plantar fascia ) stretch soft tissue mobilization calf stretch , ankle range motion exercise . The plantar fascia stretch consist patient sit place his/her affected foot cross opposite knee use his/her hand pull toe ankle back towards anterior surface low leg . Once position patient continue hold stretch apply deep pressure plantar fascia heel toe his/her finger , thumb , knuckle . This activity carry three minutes.2 For gastrocnemius soleus stretch , patient stand 46-61cm away wall , place his/her hand wall shoulder level , bend knee uninvolved leg , extend leg involve side foot 30cm back . Keeping back knee straight , patient lean slowly wall maintain his/her heel floor hold stretch 30 second . This stretch repeat four time per session . Ankle range motion exercise complete prior patient get bed morning consist patient : dorsiflexing plantar flex his/her ankle involve side , knee straight knee bent , ten time position ; perform clockwise counter-clockwise ankle circle ten time direction . Participant 's outcome indicator record end two week , four week , twelve week , six month follow casting . The following outcome measure use : NPRS , FAAM , FPI-6 , GRC . Subjects see clinic initial exam , two , four , twelve week follow-up interval , final six month follow-up conducted via e-mail , telephone , postal mail , per subject 's preference . C. Subject Recruitment Convenience sample implement select 60 subject population individual chronic plantar fasciitis either receive , receive treatment previous three month condition . Following IRB approval , clinical site , run store university campus solicit recruitment participant . Inclusion sample include : age 18 year old , able tolerate physical examination treatment procedure , symptom great four week , able read , write , speak sufficient English able complete outcome tool , plus two three follow : symptom reproduction palpation proximal plantar fascia insertion and/or mid substance plantar fascia , positive Windlass test and/or first step pain period inactivity . A positive Windlass test consist symptom reproduction first metatarsophalangeal joint place passive extension patient stand position . Exclusion criterion sample include : current symptom consistent lumbar radiculitis , radiculopathy , myelopathy , history foot ankle fracture without presence hardware open reduction internal fixation , positive tarsal tunnel syndrome test , know suspected pregnancy , systemic Rheumatic disease , undergo litigation medical condition . D. Confidentiality Data The subject carefully screen eliminate possible risk protocol . The screening , evaluation treatment perform physical therapist senior physical therapy student fully train perform procedure scope practice . As standard practice , investigator communicate subject entire process ensure subject inform throughout treatment protocol . All record keep confidential per HIPAA university operating procedure . No personal identifying information subject study release anyone . Data secure lock room computer password-protected accessible investigator study . In unlikely event adverse response treatment , subject provide appropriate physical therapy medical intervention . E. Risk Subjects The effect custom-made orthotics fabricate Aquaplast treatment plantar fasciitis well documented literature . However , non-invasive , patient-directed treatment minimal know risk , consider safe ethical practice . A faux orthotic also low-risk treatment method pose risk health control subject . Risks would include blister abrasion orthotic rub foot soreness pain associate change joint alignment due orthotic . The subject instruct return immediately , call researcher , pain associate wear either orthotic . F. Benefits Experimental participant benefit study receive treatment attempt eliminate , significantly reduce , heel pain associate plantar fasciitis , may yield effective , non-invasive , treatment strategy eliminate symptom associate plantar fasciitis . Upon completion study subject control group offer PFO , result show significant improvement experimental group . All subject experimental group able keep PFO 's .</detailed_description>
