	<brief_title>Pre-operative Decitabine Colon Cancer : Proof Principle Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Colon cancer second lead cause cancer-related death world wide . Although patient present early disease ( stage I-III ) cure , prognosis varies 90 % stage I 50-80 % stage II III . Therefore , prevention metastasis early disease utmost importance . Extensive study Wnt signal cascade elucidate role colorectal cancer development proliferation . Several well-known target Wnt-cascade , like DKK1 , APCDD1 AXIN2 , serve feedback inhibitor likely prevent pathway hyperactivation . Therefore , loss control mechanism , example due repression Wnt target CpG island methylation , serve potent proliferative signal . Recently , identify subset colon cancer typify CpG island methylation specific Wnt target gene poor prognosis . Moreover , preclinical study show derepression Wnt-targets demethylating agent decitabine result tumor growth suppression . Thus , derepression Wnt target may provide novel target therapy . Objectives : The primary objective study ass patient primary colon cancer whether short-course pre-operative treatment decitabine increase Wnt target gene expression measure resect tumor compare pretreatment biopsy . The secondary objective study ass patient primary colon cancer whether short-course pre-operative treatment decitabine revert CpG methylation induce favorable tumor characteristic measure resected tumor compare pretreatment biopsy . The tertiary objective compare change Wnt target gene expression , CpG methylation tumor characteristic Wnt methylated nonmethylated tumor measure resected tumor compare pretreatment biopsy identify new stratification marker . Study design : Interventional study . Study population : Patients &gt; 18 yr old histopathologically proven high suspicion colon cancer . Intervention : In patient proven colon cancer , five extra biopsy take tumour endoscopy determine CpG methylation Wnt target gene fresh tumor sample . Next , patient pre-operatively receive decitabine single intravenous infusion dose 45 mg/m2 6 hr . After resection , Wnt target gene expression CpG methylation Wnt target gene determine fresh tumor sample . Main study parameter : The primary study parameter Wnt target gene expression ( APCDD1 , AXIN2 , DKK1 , LGR5 ASCL2 ) . Secondary study parameter Wnt target CIMP gene methylation , beta-catenin localization , proliferation ( Ki-67 ) , apoptosis ( TUNEL M30 assay ) tumor differentiation .</detailed_description>
