Prospective memory ability remember perform previously intend task appropriate time occasion , instance remember correct exit drive highway . Impairment area may result serious consequence patient cirrhosis . There evidence subset cirrhotic patient diminished ability drive significantly motor vehicle crash traffic violation . In patient , listen music driving may jeopardize drive ability , turn may lead reduce quality life increase medical cost ( motor vehicle accident ) . This cross-sectional study design determine effect listen music attention prospective memory patient cirrhosis . For purpose , subject ask come one study visit , last approximately 2 hour . During visit , subject undergo series screening procedure ( consent , assignment subject identification number , demographic , medical history , physical examination , vitals , height , weight , eligibility assessment ) . If find eligible , subject undergo several neuropsychological assessment measure effect music attention prospective memory . These assessment include include Number Connection Test ( NCT ) , Digit Symbol Test ( DST ) , Cambridge Prospective Memory Test ( CAMPROMPT ) Inhibitory Control Test ( ICT ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cirrhosis occur scar tissue replace healthy liver tissue , partially block blood flow prevent liver 's ability control infection , remove bacteria toxin blood , produce protein regulate blood clot bile absorb fat fat-soluble vitamin . With estimate prevalence five ten percent , cirrhosis twelfth lead cause death disease , lead 27,000 death per year . Heavy alcohol consumption hepatotropic virus ( hepatitis B C ) major contributor disease 's prevalence ( NDDIC , 2003 ) . Hepatic encephalopathy ( HE ) potentially reversible , metabolically cause complication acute chronic liver disease cirrhosis , characterize neuropsychiatric abnormality . Nearly 70 % cirrhotic patient experience mild level HE approximately 30 % end-stage patient experience significant HE symptoms , many approach coma ( Mullen et al. , 1999 ) . Although pathophysiology HE yet clearly understood , accumulation ammonia brain due liver 's inability remove toxin ( include ammonia ) think play key role pathogenesis HE . Other factor , mutually exclusive , include increase GABA-ergic tone , selective alteration blood-brain barrier permeability change neurotransmitter system . The broad spectrum symptom HE include forgetfulness , confusion , disorientation , concentration memory problem , change mood , decrease alertness responsiveness , change sleep habit , muscle tremor stiffness , speech impairment , uncontrollable movement , agitation ( Ferenci et al. , 2002 ) . The diagnosis HE essentially base clinical history laboratory finding elevate ammonia level . Additionally , specialize psychometric test number connection test ( NCT ) , Digit Symbol Test ( DST ) Psychometric Hepatic Encephalopathy Score ( PHES ) use quantify minor deficit may present patient early HE . Minimal hepatic encephalopathy ( MHE ) category early HE without overt neuropsychiatric symptom subtle cognitive deficit ( Ferenci et al. , 1998 ) . It common complication cirrhosis report 20 % 74 % patient ( Dhiman et al. , 2010 ) , depend test use diagnosis . It result deficit specific cognitive domain attention , vigilance , response inhibition , executive function prospective memory . These deficit often apparent routine neurological exam MMSE detect psychometric testing . The prompt identification treatment MHE essential MHE predict progression overt HE impair capacity drive significant impact patient ' quality life ( Romero-Gomez et al. , 2001 ; Wein et al , 2004 ) . Treatment HE without liver transplantation show reverse cognitive deficit improve quality life ( Prasad et al. , 2007 ; Sidhu et al. , 2011 ) . Although PHES NCT gold standard diagnose MHE , utility limit due expensive copyright , need trained psychologist lack reimbursement insurance company . A simple test would therefore beneficial internist could easily implement clinic setting . The inhibitory control task ( ICT ) computerize psychometric test introduce recently diagnostic tool MHE . It measure ability sustain attention inhibit response relevant stimulus , 2 basic cognitive domain impaired MHE . During ICT , patient present continuous stream letter 500-ms interval intersperse within letter letter X Y . Subjects instruct respond letter `` X '' `` Y '' alternate ( call target ) , independent letter . In contrast , patient instruct refrain responding , i.e . inhibit response , `` X '' `` Y '' alternating ( call lure ) . Higher rate target response , low rate lure response shorter reaction time indicate good attention response inhibition . One study Bajaj et al . ( 2008 ) show ICT reliable test 87 % sensitivity diagnosis MHE , MHE patient higher ICT lure low target compare patient without MHE . Patients MHE deficit attention prospective memory cognitive domain important activity drive . Sustaining attention important learn remember new information , e.g . keep car within lane drive pay attention pedestrian cyclist . Prospective memory involve work memory ( formulate , initiate , modify plan action ) retrospective memory ( recall need do particular time response external cue ) , instance , remember correct exit drive highway . The act drive require ability sustain attention utilize prospective memory stressful condition . Impairment area may result serious consequence patient chronic liver disease , cirrhosis . Indeed , study cirrhotic patient show MHE diminished ability drive significantly motor vehicle crash traffic violation without MHE ( Bajaj et al. , 2007 , 2009 ) . The reason behind thought obvious cognitive deficit , also great tendency fatigue wheel poor insight cognitive deficiency ( Kircheis et al. , 2009 ) . In fact , drive simulator test questionnaire survey show patient MHE diagnose use ICT impair navigational skill significantly high crash rate ( Bajaj et al. , 2008 , 2009 ) . In addition potential value ICT detect MHE , test may useful uncover temporary insult attention work memory may arise presence external stimulus music . Listening music driving pervasive practice relationship background music drive performance study past ( Unal et al. , 2012 ; van der Zwaag et al. , 2012 ) . However study specifically address patient cirrhosis , population high risk traffic accident . The hypothesis study ( 1 ) cirrhotic patient MHE expect low ICT score patient without MHE ( 2 ) deficit expect worsen presence music , suggest music possible factor could contribute impaired attention work memory , hence impaired drive ability cirrhotic patient . To end , various type music , include classical heavy metal , use mean distract cirrhotic patient administer ICT , determine effect listen music ICT score . In addition ICT , Digit Symbol Test , Number Connection Test , Cambridge Prospective Memory Test ( CAMPROMPT ) , Stroop test , Fisk Fatigue Impact Scale Epworth Sleepiness Scale also administer quantify degree HE . While use ICT may appropriate definitively predict drive fitness , may valuable uncover deficit attention memory arise listen music , may ultimately aid counsel education patient regard safe driving practice .</detailed_description>
