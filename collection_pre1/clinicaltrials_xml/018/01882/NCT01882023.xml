	<brief_summary>Currently , robust , testable neural model available sufficiently explain development maintenance anorexia nervosa ( AN ) severe , often fatal , adolescent-onset eating disorder . Using state art neuroimaging neuropsychological technique , objective identify neural mechanism adolescent brain underlie AN . This high clinical relevance much provide robust platform diagnostic battery physician identify prone develop AN early stage life . The aim research plan : 1 ) To develop knowledge cognitive dysfunction adolescent recently diagnose AN , battery cognitive test series clinical visit . 2 ) To provide scientific basis knowledge brain adolescent eat disorder differs healthy adolescent , conduct functional structural magnetic resonance image adolescent female AN .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adolescents eat disorder debilitate cognitive disturbance impact social , educational physical health . One cognitive trait find form core cognitive disturbance AN superior work memory ( WM ) . WM ability ruminate cognitive strategy attend detail another task , exclude non-relevant stimulus , link activation dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) . By administer functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( fMRI ) recently find female AN increased activation DLPFC reduce appetitive brain response think eat food show visual image . This suggest increase WM capacity AN may serve suppress food intake , yet clarify . In line assumption , also show restraint appetite AN link great plasticity DLPFC . Furthermore , Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) DLPFC reduce appetitive response food stimulus adult eat disorder . Conversely , show obese link reduced structure abnormal function DLPFC , well reduce attentional control/WM performance . Therefore , likely DLPFC-related WM function associate eat disorder , particularly cognitive restraint appetite . It likely interaction appetitive brain region specific prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) cognition determine whether adolescent develop anorexia nervosa . We aim provide neuropsychological brain imaging measure show specific cognitive function link early-onset disordered eat behaviour , standard clinical treatment . We suggest understand could enable school nurse use unique paradigm use fMRI study , detect illness damage child 's life become difficult treat . The study increase include genetic component examine genetic epigenetic variation gene find link eat disorder .</detailed_description>
