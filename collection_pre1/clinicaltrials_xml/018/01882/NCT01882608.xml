Mental health telemetry ( MHT ) let patient community use cell phone track severity mood symptom time , enables clinician view symptom rating real-time .

	<brief_title>Using Mental Health Telemetry Predict Relapse Re-hospitalization Mood Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The mood disorder ( major depressive disorder , bipolar disorder , dysthymia ) significant public health issue : mood disorder affect approximately one four people live ; total , 8 million Canadians affect mood disorder , cost economy $ 6 billion annually . Mood disorder generally recurrent : approximately 50 % case major depressive disorder relapse least ; 15 % run chronic course . With bipolar disorder , chronic course episode depression and/or mania intermixed episode normal mood typical . At Sunnybrook ( SHSC ) , 75 % inpatient mental health admission due mood disorder . Clinically , mood disorder , early recognition symptom change patient provide great potential early intervention suppression relapse , turn lead reduced outpatient resource utilization , few Emergency Department visit , few readmission . Ecological momentary assessment ( EMA ) , body work develop late 90 early 00 's , focus use data collect subject live daily life natural environment use minimally invasive technique improve quality data collect . Mental health telemetry ( MHT ) evolution EMA . MHT develop Sunnybrook partnership Faculty Medicine University Toronto ; use wirelessly networked handheld computer - typically , cell phone - collect self-report data symptom illness transmit real-time central database . Principal advantage MHT EMA include ( ) ability time- date-stamp data , thus eliminate retrospective record completion , ( ii ) ability observe monitor data flow real-time , without wait participant upload deliver data ( e.g. , next doctor ' appointment ) . MHT use collect rich set longitudinal self-report rating patient live daily life community ; population study include adult depression , premenstrual syndrome , bipolar disorder ( long 18 month ) , well teens mood swing ( long nine month ) . Adherence daily ( frequent ) symptom report use MHT study good , adherence rate 75Â±5 % duration study . MHT considerable potential reduce rate inpatient re-hospitalization mood disorder . EMA method previously show superior standard patient follow-ups detect medication response depression14 day ill bipolar disorder18 . While numerous previous study look general pattern recurrence prognostic factor long-term course major depressive disorder4 ; 23 ; 24 ; 27 bipolar disorder , none look use EMA MHT data monitor sign imminent relapse individual case . The rich data stream provide MHT allow u first time , similar ECG telemetry routinely use diagnostic prognostic purpose . Doing enable clinician trigger early community- outpatient-based intervention , thus reduce likelihood relapse / hospitalization . One limitation MHT study to-date platform-specific nature MHT system use : rather use platform-independent software , system deploy date custom-created specific cell-phone platform ( e.g. , Kyocera pdQ 1900 , Palm Treo family SmartPhones , Motorola QA30 ) . As result , , MHT limit use participant research study provide research-funded cell phone . Therefore , explore feasibility use MHT reduce re-hospitalization patient diagnose mood disorder , : 1 . Upgrade exist patient MHT software ( record MHT ) web-based platform , thus remove hardware dependency MHT allow anyone web-capable cell phone use MHT essentially without cost ; 2 . Upgrade exist clinician PATH software ( view patient ' MHT ) , optimize user interface make easy clinician rapidly effectively visualize patient ' telemetry ; 3 . Distribute clinician PATH software interested clinician within SHSC Department Psychiatry , enable clinician receive daily , patient-generated , quantitative symptom severity rating well medication adherence side-effect report patient . ( Clinicians use information collaboration patient aid monitoring patient ' mental status course study . ) 4 . Over duration study , distribute patient MHT software random sample patient ( ) mood disorder discharge Sunnybrook 's inpatient mental health ward ( F2 ) ( ii ) bipolar disorder follow outpatient psychiatry clinic Sunnybrook ; , 5 . Compare re-hospitalization rate quality-of-life measure MHT user 6 month period control group similar patient use MHT .</detailed_description>
