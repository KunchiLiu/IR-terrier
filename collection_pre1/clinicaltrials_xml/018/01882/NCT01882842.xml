	<brief_title>A Study Assess Scratching Lining Womb Prior IVF Treatment Increases Chances Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following consent , participant randomise one two trial intervention ( endometrial biopsy , ultrasound scan = intervention ) member research team . The procedure schedule luteinising hormone ( LH ) day +7 +9 menstrual cycle directly precede commencement down-regulation medication . A urine pregnancy test perform studied procedure . Just prior biopsy directly follow , transvaginal ultrasound scan perform assess length uterine cavity endometrial parameter , include blood flow characteristic use power Doppler imaging . Endometrial sample obtain use standard sample procedure appropriately trained clinician . Participants randomise treatment arm undergo endometrial biopsy procedure use Pipelle endometrial sampler ( Pipelle de Cornier , Laboratoire CCD , Paris , France ) Wallace/ Wallach endometrial sampler alternative device cycle day LH+7 LH+9 cycle directly precede commencement down-regulation prior IVF ICSI treatment . The endometrial sampling repeat maximum four time ( appointment day LH+7 LH+9 menstrual cycle ) assure sufficient sample obtain . If follow first two attempt , endometrial sample sufficient , procedure deem complete . The Pipelle sampler introduce uterine fundus ( base clinical touch technique ultrasound measurement ) , attempt make obtain sample four wall endometrial cavity . Participants randomise control group also supply home LH test kit inform unit participate . Once ovulation test positive , participant contact unit arrange ultrasound appointment day LH+7 LH+9 cycle directly precede commencement IVF/ICSI treatment . 48 72 hour later additional appointment schedule ultrasound scan blood test . Subjects randomise one two treatment arm base computer generate pseudo-random code use random permute block randomly vary size , create University Nottingham Clinical Trials Unit ( CTU ) . As pilot feasibility study , randomisation stratify factor . Allocation treatment ratio 1:1 . The corresponding treatment allocation transmit unblinded clinician , arrange appropriate appointment study procedure . Due nature study , blind participant researcher possible .</detailed_description>
