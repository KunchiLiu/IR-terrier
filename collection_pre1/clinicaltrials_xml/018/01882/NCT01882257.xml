	<brief_summary>- Patients spinal cord injury ( SCI ) usually breathe without mechanical assistance , significant breathing problem occur often sleep , either upper airway close ( obstructive sleep apnea ; OSA ) , weakness/paralysis breathing muscle . These problem often go unrecognized , SCI patient face logistical barrier cause refuse appropriate test sleep laboratory . We devise strategy diagnose sleep-disordered breathing patient 's home , use placement noninvasive device monitor breathe overnight . This project design test feasibility utility strategy . - After collect baseline data symptom medical event four month , home-based study perform noninvasively FDA-approved device : type III sleep system record oxygen saturation/ transcutaneous carbon dioxide monitor . If study identify sleep-disordered breathing , noninvasive ventilatory support prescribe accord standard clinical practice . Over follow twelve month , subject monitor symptoms daily , answer quality-of-life questionnaire every three month . After 3 , 6 , 12 month , blood test perform measure blood sugar cholesterol/lipids . Data download ventilator device monitor compliance ventilator performance . This study design determine prevalence sleep-disordered breathing SCI , feasibility home-based test establish diagnosis , short term effect symptom , quality-of-life , associated condition ( glucose intolerance , blood lipid disorder ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eligible subject sign inform consent , follow : 4 month period maintain daily log symptom medical event ( hospitalization , start antibiotic ) . An overnight sleep study perform subject 's home Based result sleep study , noninvasive ventilation ( BiPAP ) prescribe , accord standard medical practice . A clinical assessment , pulmonary function test , blood test ( blood glucose , hemoglobin A1C , blood lipid profile ) perform time . Quality life survey perform month 0 , 3 , 6 , 12 . The daily symptom log continue 12 month . Data BiPAP unit download repeat overnight monitoring measure blood oxygen carbon dioxide level perform periodically 12 month BiPAP start . Subjects without sleep-disordered breathe clinical assessment blood test subject BiPAP described .</detailed_description>
