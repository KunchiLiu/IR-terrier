	<detailed_description>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common cardiac arrhythmia associate high risk cardiovascular event increase morbidity mortality . Cardiovascular event prevalently localize cerebral circulation AF responsible ischemic stroke . Clinical characteristic ischemic stroke AF almost severe thromboembolism consider important cause . Thus , ischemic stroke deem origin thrombus formation generate left atrium ensue embolism cerebral circulation . Patients AF typically associate different risk factor atherothrombosis include , overall , hypertension may detect 70-80 % population ; risk factor diabetes dyslipidemia . This account instrumental evidence systemic atherosclerosis associate AF . Thus , sign atherosclerosis detect thoracic aorta , represent aortic plaque assess trans-esophageal echocardiography ; patient complex aortic plaque fourfold increase rate stroke compare plaque-free patient . Metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) constellation atherosclerotic risk factor include , accord modify National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III ( NCEP-ATPIII ) , hypertension , low HDL , impaired glycaemic control , hypertriglyceridemia central obesity assess waist circumference ; presence MetS associate increase risk develop cardiac cerebral ischemic event . An high risk develop atrial fibrillation ( AF ) well recognize patient MetS . In prospective , community-based , observational cohort study annual health check-up 28449 subject without AF age-adjusted rate AF high subject compare without metabolic syndrome mean follow-up 4.5 year . Few study report prevalence MetS AF population still lack . Some data infer study regard recurrence AF catheter ablation report prevalence range 18.8 % 49.4 % . The population study far publish include 741 chinese patient report prevalence MetS AF 46.3 % . Taking account different threshold waist circumference recommend international society different ethnic group , unclear prevalence extrapolate population western country . Furthermore impact MetS incidence cardiovascular event patient non valvular AF ( NVAF ) take oral anticoagulant therapy ( OAT ) never investigate . Therefore , aim investigate prevalence MetS population NVAF patient oral coagulation treatment impact cardiovascular event prospective study .</detailed_description>
