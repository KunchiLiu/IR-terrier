	<brief_summary>A good understanding knee joint kinematics important explain premature polyethylene wear failure within total knee arthroplasty ( TKAs ) help design prosthesis closely approximate normal knee . Previously , experimental study knee kinematics involve cadaveric , vitro analysis , test knee weight-bearing mode . Others use exoskeletal linkage skin marker permit error due undesired motion marker underlie bone . More recently , fluoroscopy use assess vivo kinematics subject TKA . ConforMIS attempt follow clearly different path major orthopaedic company . They choose offer patient personalize knee implant base patient 's femoral tibial bone geometry . The hypothesis subject experience normal-like kinematic pattern , eliminate paradoxical anterior slide weight-bearing knee flexion . Therefore , objective study analyze vivo kinematics 25 patient implanted personalized ConforMIS TKA 25 patient implanted traditional TKA design determine kinematic difference TKA design .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Each subject ask perform five activity one continuous sequence : ( 1 ) stand chair , ( 2 ) walk stair , ( 3 ) walk stair , ( 4 ) level walking , ( 5 ) deep knee bend . Subjects video record waist performing activity . The speed level trial base comfort level patient . The fluoroscopic image store digitally subsequent analysis secure server workstation University Tennessee .</detailed_description>
