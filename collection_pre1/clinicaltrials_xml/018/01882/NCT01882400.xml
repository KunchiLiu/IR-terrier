	<brief_title>Assessment Response Treatment Osteoporosis With Oral Bisphosphonates Patients With Muscular Dystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children muscular dystrophy , well child chronic disease ( e.g . cystic fibrosis , chronic inflammatory arthritis ) risk develop fragility fracture due disease drug ( mostly corticosteroid ) use treat disease . In addition , child muscular dystrophy frequently complain diffuse pain make daily care difficult almost always develop structural scoliosis . The objective present protocol offer child preventive treatment aim maintain increase bone mass . We also propose maintain bone mass decrease fracture rate , well pain rate progression scoliosis . Rigorous care ensure adequate intake calcium vitamin D , well addition weekly bisphosphonate , central aspect project . In addition , monitor avoid possible side-effects hypercalciuria kidney stone .</detailed_description>
