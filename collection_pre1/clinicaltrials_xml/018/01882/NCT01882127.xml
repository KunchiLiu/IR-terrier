	<brief_title>All-Trans Retinoic Acid ( ATRA ) Combining Dexamethasone Versus High-dose Dexamethasone Initial Treatment Primary Immune Thrombocytopenia ( ITP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator undertake parallel group , randomise control trial 80 primary ITP adult patient Qilu Hospital Shandong University China . One part participant randomly select receive All-Trans Retinoic Acid ( 10mg tablet mouth every 8 hour day 12 consecutive week , combine dexamethasone ( give orally dose 40 mg per day 4 day , others select receive high-dose dexamethasone treatment ( give orally dose 40 mg daily 4 day ) . Patients monitor every 1 3 day first two week every 1 4 week afterwards platelet count , monitor every 1 month transaminitis side effect</detailed_description>
