	<brief_title>Leukine ( Sargramostim ) Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) progressive disable neurological disorder involve nigrostriatum cure know . Evidence suggest inflammation contributes , significantly , cause and/or progression disease . Studies postmortem human brain , animal model , human peripheral blood support idea frequency function particular circulate T cell subset abnormal worsen disease progress . This abnormality link specifically increase number T effector neurodestructive cell ( Teff ) dysfunction regulatory T cell ( Treg ) control Teff . This imbalance tip homeostatic balance pro-inflammatory profile limit control . Nonetheless , whether T cell deficit cause PD reaction remain unknown . If deficit causal exacerbative , correct deficit could significant positive effect disease progression could ameliorate nigrostriatal degeneration sequela . Granulocyte macrophage colony stimulate factor ( GM-CSF ) potential immunomodulatory therapeutic PD increase Treg number function reduce transform proinflammatory Teff responses , lead neuroprotection nigrostriatum improve clinical outcome disease . Recombinant human GM-CSF ( sargramostim ) available Leukine® . The purpose study determine Leukine ( sargramostim ) safely administer Parkinson 's disease patient extend period time ( 56 day ) . In previous study conduct University Nebraska Medical Center ( UNMC ) use sample whole blood , PD patient show difference caregiver control accord result complete blood count ( CBC ) white blood cell ( WBC ) differential , fluorescence-activated cell sort ( FACS ) analysis T cell marker , Treg functional assay . These immune aberration correlate motor dysfunction determine Parkinson 's disease rating scale ( UPDRS ) part III assessment . In pilot study , effect Leukine treatment immune deficit PD patient monitor . Immune cell analysis whole blood , motor assessment , physical examination blood analysis safety , conduct , , Leukine placebo treatment PD patient , use healthy control baseline data collection drug treatment . Initially , 16 PD patient 16 control recruit . Subjects draw previous study . Enrollment supplement need patient Neurology Consultants Nebraska-PC , UNMC Neurological Sciences , recruitment American Parkinson 's Disease Association . Enrollment stagger , additional subject recruit need replace withdraw participant , goal 32 subject , 16 PD patient 16 control , complete study . At enrollment repeat two 4-week interval , whole blood PD patient control obtain percutaneously use standard sterile technique . CBC WBC differential , FACS analysis T cell marker , Treg functional assay perform used calculate immune response profile baseline comparison drug treatment . Blood chemistry analyze include liver enzymes , electrolyte , blood urea nitrogen , creatinine , total protein , albumin bilirubin level , anti-GM-CSF antibody assess PD patient . PD patient evaluate physical clinical examination , include UPDRS part III assessments evaluation motor function . PD patient randomize two group , placebo ( n=8 ) Leukine ( n=8 ) , participation control end . Patients enter study note co-morbid condition include infection , inflammatory cancerous disease take immunostimulatory immunosuppressive medicine . Patients continue take medicine prescribe general treatment PD , include , limited , dopamine dopamine agonist . There history prior surgery link PD treatment . Patients receive train self-injection , treatment group self-administer Leukine ( 6 µg/kg ) subcutaneous injection daily eight week . The placebo group self-administer saline placebo . Every two week start treatment 4 week cessation administration , PD patient , receive drug placebo , evaluate physical clinical examination , include UPDRS part III assessment . Every 2 week Leukine treatment 4 week cessation drug , whole blood PD patient obtain percutaneously use standard sterile technique . At week 2 , 4 8 , result CBC WBC differential , FACS analysis T cell marker , Treg functional assay use calculate immune response profile compare baseline value . CBC WBC differential , total T cell count , blood chemistry analyze every 2 week evidence potential toxicity , well 4 week termination Leukine treatment . Levels anti-GM-CSF antibody assess PD patient enrollment 4 week intervals drug treatment 4 week termination . Optional video recording make baseline , end drug/placebo treatment follow-up . An additional component study include development magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) monitor tool PD . MEG provide non-invasive method study brain activity . Currently , adequate assessment tool monitor disease progression treatment protocols PD . In preliminary experiment PD patient caregiver , MEG data indicate strong beta synchronization rest PD milder beta desynchronization movement preparation compare age- sex-matched control . In study , amplitude pathological beta synchronization/desynchronization monitor evaluate improvement cortical brain function PD patient treat Leukine . MEG perform PD patient control start drug treatment , PD patient end drug treatment period 4 week drug stop . Among first 8 patient enrol study , observe unexpected statistically significant change unify PD rating scale part III ( UPDRS part III ) clinical evaluation motor function half patient test . This test , however , view subjective . To objectively analytically score motor function , biomechanical assessment subject 's mobility , postural balance , upper extremity motor control rest state tremor perform remain eight PD patient receive Leukine placebo . These assessment occur baseline , 7 8 week drug treatment , 4-5 week cessation drug treatment . Motor function test design provide objective , computer generate score measured patient performance test . To investigate possible mechanism change motor function observe within two week therapy , test plasma/serum neurotransmitter perform include glutamate , glutamine , serotonin , acetylcholine , gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) , norepinephrine epinephrine . These measure perform last cohort PD patient study initiation treatment , 8 week treatment initiate 4 week cessation drug treatment . The test evaluate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) ultra-performance liquid chromatography ( UPLC ) . A decision assay do neurotransmitter base sensitivity standard curve measure . Relationships neurotransmitter level motor function determine . These test addition current ongoing approved laboratory test . Eligibility requirement unchanged currently impose . Measures motor function serum/plasma neurotransmitter concentration also complete 4-5 week cessation treatment . The notion explore neurotransmitter study base role motor function include fatigue , bowel , sexual dysfunction mood change also observe PD well GM-CSF show affect neurotransmitter level ( 96 ) . This range list neurotransmitter investigate first part study require limited additional blood assay resource last part investigation .</detailed_description>
