	<brief_title>Efficacy Classification Based 'Cognitive Functional Therapy ' Nurses With Non Specific Chronic Low Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low back pain ( LBP ) common , recalcitrant costly health problem , limit patient ' daily activity . In 85 % case , LBP classify 'non-specific ' , mean clear underlie patho-anatomical/radiological abnormality . This subgroup often give rise chronic fluctuating problem . Although case LBP resolve within 8 12 week , may become chronic 15 % patient . LBP constitute enormous grow medical socio-economical problem modern society . Nursing identified amongst top profession risk occupational LBP , lifetime prevalence 66 % -82 % . The impact LBP nurse include time work , increase risk chronicity , associate personal economic cost reduce nurse workforce efficiency . Non Specific Chronic Low Back Pain ( NSCLBP ) widely view multifactorial biopsychosocial pain syndrome . It propose several author NSCLBP represent vicious cycle associate different combination maladaptive ; cognitive ( negative belief , fear avoidance behaviour , catastrophising , depression , stress , lack pace cop ) , physical ( pain provocative posture , movement pattern pain behaviour ) lifestyle ( inactivity , rest ) behaviours act promote pain disability . However recent systematic review suggest change paradigm investigator new understand NSCLBP result clinical trial utilize multidimensional classification system target intervention base underlying mechanism . In line paradigm shift novel multidimensional classification system develop incorporate biopsychosocial model , subgroup patient base underlying pain mechanism . Enabling classification base intervention targetting maladaptive cognitive , physical lifestyle behaviour associate disorder .</detailed_description>
