	<criteria>A diagnosis Schizophrenia . Ability provide write informed consent . Ability understand protocol meet protocol requirement . Must good physical health determine ECG laboratory value , medical history physical examination . Has stable disease , define meeting follow criterion : A CGIS score &lt; = 4 ( moderately ill ) ; A PANSS total score &lt; = 60 ; A score &lt; = 4 ( moderate ) follow PANSS item : ( P7 ( hostility ) ; G8 ( uncooperativeness ) ) . Body mass index 19 35 kg/m2 Sexually active male female childbearing potential practicing doublebarrier birth control , remain abstinent , trial 30 day follow last dose trial medication . If employing birth control , 2 follow precaution must use : vasectomy , partner use hormonal contraception , tubal ligation , vaginal diaphragm , nonhormonal intrauterine device , condom , sponge spermicide . Females pregnant lactating . A negative serum pregnancy test must confirm prior first dose trial medication female subject . Subjects present first episode schizophrenia base clinical judgment investigator . Subjects receive continuous medication therapy treat schizophrenia le 6 month prior drugfree interval . Subjects schizophrenia consider resistant/refractory antipsychotic treatment history , history failure clozapine , responsive clozapine treatment . Subjects current DSMIVTR Axis I diagnosis schizophrenia include MDD , bipolar disorder , delirium , dementia , amnestic , cognitive disorder subject borderline , paranoid , histrionic , schizotypal , schizoid , antisocial personality disorder . Subjects , opinion investigator , rat reliably battery movement rating scale require protocol . Subjects significant risk violent behavior , significant risk commit suicide base history investigator 's judgment , attempt suicide within 2 year cohort assignment . Subjects clinically significant tardive dyskinesia enrollment . Subjects experience clinical deterioration drugfree interval , require prohibit rescue therapy , meet trial criterion replace . Subjects experience acute exacerbation require hospitalization within 3 month prior Screening Visit Screening Baseline Visits . Subjects experience acute exacerbation require change antipsychotic medication ( reference drug dose ) within last 4 week prior baseline . Subjects history myocardial infarction , hypertension , diabetes evidence medical condition would expose undue risk significant AE interfere assessment safety efficacy course trial , include , limited , hepatic , renal , respiratory , cardiovascular , endocrine , neurologic , hematologic , immunologic disease . The medical monitor must contact discuss condition prior cohort assignment . Subjects follow neurologic diagnosis , whether treatment , whether stable : migraine , epilepsy , Parkinson 's disease , Alzheimer 's disease , multiple sclerosis , residual stroke , transient cerebral ischemic attack , cerebral palsy , condition require intermittent maintenance treatment manifest abnormality neurologic examination . A subject tardive dyskinesia nonclinically significant symptom EPS due solely current prior use antipsychotic medication exclude criterion . Singlenerve peripheral palsy also exclude criterion : eg , Bell 's palsy radialnerve palsy fix residual traumatic injury . History current hepatitis acquire immunodeficiency syndrome carrier HBsAg and/or antiHCV HIV antibody . Subjects history thyroid pathology ( unless condition stabilize medication least past 3 month ) and/or abnormal thyroid laboratory result . Subjects history neuroleptic malignant syndrome . Subjects history seizure disorder . Subjects meet DSMIVTR criterion substance dependence within 6 month prior cohort assignment ( exclude caffeine nicotine ) , include alcohol benzodiazepine , and/or positive alcohol ( breath urine ) test positive urine screen drug abuse . ( In case subject positive screen stimulant and/or marijuana therefore exclude , medical monitor contact determine rescreening option . ) Subjects major surgery , blood transfusion , donate blood plasma within 30 day prior enrollment . The following laboratory test , vital sign , ECG result exclusionary : 1 . Platelets &lt; = 75,000/mm3 2 . Hemoglobin &lt; = 9 g/dL 3 . Neutrophils , absolute &lt; = 1000/mm3 4 . AST &gt; 2 time upper limit normal 5 . ALT &gt; 2 time upper limit normal 6 . Creatinine &gt; = 2 mg/dL Subjects electrolytes outside normal range enrol trial without prior review approval medical monitor . Subjects sit ( perform first ) supine blood pressure , rest &gt; = 3 minute , high 140/90 mmHg low 100/50 mmHg . Upon stand supine position , subject fall systolic blood pressure &gt; = 20 mmHg fall diastolic blood pressure &gt; = 10 mm Hg 1 3 minute stand position . ( Any repeat outofrange value deem clinically significant need discuss medical monitor determine eligibility . ) Subjects supine pulse rate , rest &gt; = 3 minute , outside range 40 90 bpm . Subjects ECG abnormality Screening , prior dose , exclude , include limited , PR interval &gt; 220 msec , QRS interval &gt; 110 msec , QTc &gt; 450 msec , QTcF &gt; 450 msec , QTcB &gt; 450 msec increase QTcB consider significant investigator , abnormal U wave , minor STT wave change consider clinically significant . Prohibited concomitant medications/therapies use following time period prior Day −1 duration trial include : Antipsychotics 1 . Use oral antipsychotic within 21 day prior Day −1 ; 2 . Use longacting injectable antipsychotic within 6 month . Anxiolytics Sleep Aids 1 ) Regular use benzodiazepine 2 week ( lorazepam [ &lt; = 6 mg daily 48 hour prior PK PD assessment ] use rescue therapy 21 day prior Day −1 [ &lt; = 4 mg daily 48 hour prior PK PD assessments 24 hour prior completion EPS rating scale CSSRS ] treatment period ) . Mood Stabilizers 1 ) Use lamotrigine within 14 day . Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors 1 . Use Prozac within 28 day ; 2 . Use Paxil within 14 day ; 3 . Use Zoloft , Luvox , Celexa within 7 day . Serotonin Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors 1 . Use Effexor within 3 day ; 2 . Use duloxetine within 14 day . Other 1 . Use Symbyax within 28 day ; 2 . Use CYP2D6 CYP3A4 inhibitor CYP3A4 inducer within 14 day ; 3 . Use electroconvulsive therapy within 2 month . Use discontinuation therapy ( prescription medication , overthe counter , herbal medication , vitamin ) list must approve sponsor medical monitor . Subjects received brexpiprazole prior clinical trial . Subjects receive investigational agent clinical trial within 90 day prior Screening .

Subjects heavy smoker ( ie , &gt; 21 cigarette per day ) . Other Prisoners subject compulsorily detain ( involuntarily incarcerate ) treatment either psychiatric physical ( eg , infectious disease ) illness must enrol trial . Subjects history allergy one class medication . Any subject , opinion investigator , participate trial . A history difficulty donate blood . Exposure substance know stimulate hepatic microsomal enzyme within 30 day prior Screening end trial ( eg , occupational exposure pesticide , organic solvent ) .

Subjects MRIincompatible implant contraindication MRI , pacemaker , artificial joint , nonremovable body piercings , tattoo large 1 cm diameter , metal fragment , claustrophobia , etc . 3 . Subjects receive diagnostic therapeutic radiopharmaceutical within 7 day prior participation trial . 4 . Participation research trial involve ionize radiation within 1 year PET scan would cause subject exceed yearly dose limit normal subject . 5 . Subjects history IV drug use would prevent venous access PET tracer injection . 6 . Severe motor problem prevent subject lying still PET MRI . 7 .
