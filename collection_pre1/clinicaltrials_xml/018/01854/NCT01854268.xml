	<brief_summary>Cough defensive behavior involve three stage . A large inspiratory phase , compression phase vocal fold close subglottal pressure develop , expiratory phase . Cough serve protect upper low airway material liquid , solid , saliva , aspirate . There two type cough : voluntary reflex cough . Voluntary cough involve cough command . Reflex cough cough generate secondary stimulus near airway . There research regard difference voluntary reflex cough . However , research describe difference airflow movement pattern ( kinematics ) two type cough . This study seek determine respiratory kinematics airflow difference voluntary reflex cough healthy participant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Respiratory Kinematics During Voluntary Reflex Cough Healthy Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As participant , completion study require following : Investigators first place cotton elastic band around chest abdomen measure chest wall abdominal movement measure . Then , test breathe make pulmonary function test complete . Investigators complete maximum inspiration follow maximum expiration three time . Investigators ask produce voluntary cough three time facemask attach computer . Then investigator provide nebulized water ( FOG ) facemask minute three time . You minute break presentation . Finally , investigator provide nebulized dose Capsaicin , derive hot pepper , facemask use task . You receive three dos capsaicin provided water time study .</detailed_description>
