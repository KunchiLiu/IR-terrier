	<brief_summary>The current available antiretroviral ( ARV ) agent make possible successful treatment virtually HIV-infected patient , even heavily experienced subject , history previous failure ARV drug different class . However , problem still present , especially specific population , like pregnant woman infant . For group , currently available drug use , lack information safety , efficacy , pharmacokinetic/dynamic behavior ARVs drug . The mother child transmission ( MTCT ) still problem certain area world , especially resource-limited setting . In setting , woman often present first antenatal care visit late pregnancy , pose additional problem : effectively treat patient assure undetectable viral load moment deliver ? Depending plasma viremia magnitude , viral susceptibility take 6 week reduce viral load less desire 1,000 copy HIV-1 RNA / ml plasma . To achieve goal , would necessary use potent , efficacious ARV regimen could provide viral decay short period . Raltegravir ( RAL ) , first HIV-1 integrase inhibitor , potent safe ARV drug . The available evidence suggest genotoxic potential , promote rapid decline HIV-1 plasma viremia . In addition , RAL highly active viral strain present different degree resistance ARV drug . Thus , RAL could ideal candidate use prevention MTCT woman detectable viral load , present late course pregnancy . Another attractive point consider , due similarity integrase enzyme HIV-1 Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 ( HTLV-1 ) ; RAL could active HTLV-1 , block replication . If hypothesis correct , use f RAL-containing ARV regimen would reduce MTCT agent . This study objective evaluate efficacy RAL contain ARV regimens reduce HIV-1 RNA plasma viral load 50 copies/ml , end pregnancy , late-presenters pregnant woman compare frequency adverse event woman use RAL-based ARV regimens comparators , baby .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A total 44 late-presenters ( gestational age &gt; 28 week ) , HIV-infected pregnant woman randomly assign receive antiretroviral regimen base Zidovudine ( AZT ) +Lamivudine ( 3TC ) +Raltegravir AZT+3TC+Lopinavir/r ( LPV/r ) . They follow delivery , plasma viral load measure . The rate HIV mother-to-child-transmission compare group . The newborn follow 6 month , register adverse event period time .</detailed_description>
