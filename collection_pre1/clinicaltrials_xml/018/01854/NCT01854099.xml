	<detailed_description>Eligible patient screen enrolled prior completion post-surgical chemoradiation . Final eligibility remain study safety endpoint occur completion chemoradiation prior initiation adjuvant TMZ regimen . Immediately post-chemoradiation prior initiation cycle 1 adjuvant TMZ , patient receive 500 µg PEP-CMV vaccine weekly total 3 vaccine start 1-3 day chemoradiation complete . Prior initiation TMZ cycle 1 , patient randomize one three arm ( 1:1:1 ) receive ( 1 ) standard TMZ ( 200 mg/m^2/day x 5 day ) vaccination Day 6-8 monthly TMZ cycle , ( 2 ) standard TMZ ( 200 mg/m^2/day x 5 day ) vaccination Day 22-24 monthly TMZ cycle , ( 3 ) dose-intensified TMZ ( 100 mg/m^2/day x 21 day ) vaccination day 22-24 monthly TMZ cycle . Each cohort 20 patient . Up 150 patient consented order obtain 60 evaluable patient . The primary safety assessment dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) determine one week third weekly vaccine . A DLT define irreversible Grade 3 toxicity , Grade 4 toxicity , life threatening-event attributable concomitant medication , co-morbid event , disease progression . Initially 6 patient accrue study ( 2 per arm ) accrual suspend review toxicity experience patient first 3 weekly vaccination . If 0 1 patient experience DLT , accrual remain patient commence . Otherwise , modification protocol consider accruing additional patient . The prevalence DLT occur initial 3 weekly vaccination vaccination administer concurrently temozolomide continuously monitor . If 25 % accrued patient experience DLT , accrual suspend report toxicity carefully review determine modification protocol treatment occur . Peptide vaccination employ GM-CSF Montanide ISA-51 adjuvant generally well tolerated human patient numerous phase I-III trial . Treatment Plan : One week 3rd weekly vaccination , cycle TMZ begin . The start subsequent cycle schedule every 4 week first daily dose precede cycle . During monthly TMZ cycle , vaccination occur day 6-8 day 22-24 cycle , depend randomization arm . All vaccine give i.d . approximately 10cm inguinal ligament bilaterally . A target six cycle maximum twelve cycle TMZ may give patient demonstrates continued improvement MRI scan , decrease corticosteroid requirement , improvement performance status , improvement neurologic function discretion treat neuro-oncologist . Vaccines continue monthly TMZ cycle tumor progression death . Patients image contrast-enhanced MRI pre &amp; post-surgical resection ( prior initiation chemoradiation ) , post-chemoradiation prior TMZ cycle 1 , prior TMZ cycle 4 , 7 ( administer ) , 10 ( administer ) . MRI image every 3 month post-chemoradiation preferable , every 2 month allow discretion treat neuro-oncologist . MRI image conduct every 3 month completion TMZ 1 year , every 6 month thereafter , frequency indicate clinical presentation . The modified Response Assessment Neuro-Oncology ( RANO ) criterion use assessment pseudoprogression patient demonstrate definitive progression remove study . Any patient remove definitive tumor progression prior receive third vaccine post vaccination immune monitor blood draw replace safety immunologic endpoint . Clinical endpoint comparison make amongst patient successfully randomize adjuvant TMZ treatment arm . Blood immune monitoring obtain prior vaccine 1-4 , 7 13 , tumor progression . Patients see Duke neuro-oncology team vaccine visit may blood drawn immune monitoring discretion study team . As part standard care patient , upon tumor progression , participant may undergo stereotactic biopsy resection . As research procedure , consent obtain separately . Patients procedure do Duke University Health System , may approach participate Duke Brain Tumor Center Biorepository study . Tissue obtain patient consented Duke Brain Tumor Center Biorepository use assess immunologic cell infiltration , antigen expression , biomarkers immunologic response .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 year . Histopathologically proven newlydiagnosed primary glioblastoma multiforme . The tumor must supratentorial component . Patients must CMV seropositive . Signed informed consent . If patient 's mental status preclude his/her give inform consent , write informed consent may give responsible family member legal representative . For female childbearing potential , negative serum pregnancy test 48 hour prior temozolomide . Women childbearing potential male participant must practice adequate contraception . Karnofsky performance status ≥ 60 . Patients must recover effect surgery , postoperative infection , complication time enrollment . Prior adjuvant TMZ : Patients must complete radiation therapy ( RT ) ( 60.0Gy 6 week ) concomitant TMZ ( target dose 75mg/m2/d &lt; 49 day ) therapy without significant toxicity persist duration 4 week . Significant toxicity define one follow observation : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &lt; 0.5 x 109/L ( Grade 4 ) Platelet count &lt; 10 x 109/L ( Grade 4 ) Grade 3 4 nonhematologic adverse event ( AE ) ( except alopecia , nausea vomit unless patient fail maximal antiemetic therapy , fatigue ) . Documentation stable decrease steroid dose prior randomization goal minimize steroid use . CBC/differential adequate bone marrow function define : 1 . ANC , ≥ 1500 cells/mm^3 . Platelet count , ≥ 100,000 cells/mm^3 . 2 . Hemoglobin ≥ 10 g/dl . ( Note : The use transfusion intervention achieve Hgb ≥ 10 g/dl acceptable . ) Adequate renal function prior vaccination define : . Blood Urea Nitrogen ( BUN ) ≤ 25 mg/dl Creatinine ≤ 1.7 mg/dl Adequate hepatic function prior vaccination define : 1 . Bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dl 2 . ALT ≤ 3 x normal range 3 . AST ≤ 3 x normal range Patients start RT TMZ within 5 week surgery . Patients complete 60.0Gy 67 week RT ( patient consent prior completion complete RT remove study replace ) . Progression disease prior randomization define RANO . Prior invasive malignancy ( except nonmelanomatous skin cancer ) unless disease free ≥ 3 year . ( For example , carcinoma situ breast , oral cavity , cervix permissible . ) Metastases detect tentorium beyond cranial vault . Prior chemotherapy radiosensitizers ( include Gliadel wafer ) cancer head neck region ( TMZ prescribe radiation glioblastoma ) ; note prior chemotherapy different cancer allowable . Prior radiotherapy head neck ( except T1 glottic cancer prescribe GBM ≤60 Gy ) , result overlap radiation field . Radiosurgery permit . Severe , active comorbidity , define follow : 1 . Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure require hospitalization . 2 . Transmural myocardial infarction within last 6 month . 3 . Acute bacterial fungal infection require intravenous antibiotic time begin chemoradiation . 4 . Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease exacerbation respiratory illness require hospitalization preclude study therapy time begin chemoradiation . 5 . Hepatic insufficiency result clinical jaundice and/or coagulation defect ; note , however , laboratory test liver function coagulation parameter require entry protocol . 6 . Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) base upon current CDC definition ; note , however , HIV test require entry protocol . The need exclude patient AIDS protocol necessary treatment involve protocol may significantly immunosuppressive . 7 . Major medical illness psychiatric impairment investigator 's opinion prevent administration completion protocol therapy . 8 . Active connective tissue disorder , lupus scleroderma opinion treat physician may put patient high risk radiation toxicity . Pregnancy woman childbearing potential men sexually active willing/able use medically acceptable form contraception ; exclusion necessary treatment involve study may significantly teratogenic .
