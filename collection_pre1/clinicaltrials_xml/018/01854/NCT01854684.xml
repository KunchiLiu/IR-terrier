	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose photodynamic therapy surgery treat patient non-small cell lung cancer remove surgery . Photodynamic therapy use drug , temoporfin , become active expose certain kind light . When drug active , cancer cell kill . This may better way treat patient non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Photodynamic Therapy During Surgery Treating Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To demonstrate intraoperative adjuvant regional photodynamic therapy low-dose temoporfin safe . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Initial assessment efficacy ( i.e. , 2-year disease free survival ) . II . To investigate relationship signal transducer activator transcription 3 ( STAT3 ) level , measure light dose clinical outcome . III . Correlate serum concentration vitamin D metabolite ( 25-hydroxyvitarnin D3 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ) presence lymph node ( LN ) metastasis time surgical resection . IV . To measure temoporfin uptake malignant normal tissue . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study photodynamic therapy temoporfin . Patients receive temoporfin intravenously ( IV ) less 6 minute undergo standard surgical resection intraoperative photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
