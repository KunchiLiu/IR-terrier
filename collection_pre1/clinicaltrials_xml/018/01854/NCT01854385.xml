	<brief_summary>This phase II evaluation sumatriptan treatment post traumatic headache ( PTH ) examine method approach necessary take next step phase III trial . The sample include 40 person mild complicate , moderate severe TBI recruit patient discharge acute rehabilitation unit well outpatient clinic community 3 24 month injury follow 3 month . The investigator plan enroll moderate severe headache frequency least four maximum fifteen total headache day per month least three month discharge hospital . The investigator use headache diary track headache month . If subject still significant headache , investigator instruct use sumatriptan 100 mg. treat headache . The subject continue keep daily headache diary . The investigator evaluate baseline , Day 30 Day 90 . Each subject receive weekly telephone follow call research staff .

	<detailed_description>I . Specific Aims Study : The ultimate aim Phase II open-label study test research method approach necessary successfully carry Phase III study treatment post-traumatic headache ( PTH ) . During study , 1 . Determine feasibility use headache diary access via smart phone application , web , paper/pencil record accurate headache data group individual TBI , caregiver indicate . 2 . Evaluate approximate effect size sumatriptan pain severity , duration , recurrence headache person moderate severe PTH order establish necessary sample size Phase III study . 3 . Assess side effect profile sumatriptan brain-injured population well safety sumatriptan subject TBI . 4 . Evaluate ability person TBI , caregiver indicate , successfully use abortive headache medication comply treatment . 5 . Examine relationship PTH cognitive , emotional , self-report measure determine important factor include Phase III study . This single arm , unblinded study enrol 40 subject undertaken test necessary study instrument procedure , establish feasibility determine side effect population mild complicate , moderate severe TBI preparation subsequent Phase III study . Data collection occur enrollment ( Clinic Visit 1 ) baseline test occur , Day 30 ( Clinic Visit 2 ) , Day 90 ( Clinic Visit 3 ) . Pre-treatment Visit ( Visit 1 ) : Subjects complete informed consent meet inclusion criterion ( exclusion criterion ) ask complete 30 day headache diary document number headache , headache severity , headache day description headache associate symptom . Research staff contact weekly basis answer question maximize accuracy compliance diary . Proper utilization headache diary success data input subject caregiver evaluate follow weekly interview research assistant . Treatment Visit ( Clinic Visit 2 ) : A medical history obtain review inclusion exclusion criterion elicit thorough review system adverse event identifiable occur . Physical examination also ensure cardiovascular status compatible sumatriptan use document current status allow identification potential adverse event . Finally , standard primary headache classification criterion review patient determine whether meet criterion migraine probable migraine . Headache history assess subject experience 4-15 headache include medication intervention Sumatriptan . Subjects qualify Sumatriptan intervention receive several assessment , give medication , usage instruction , schedule weekly phone call week 5-11 . Individuals whose headache meet criterion migraine probable migraine , base data headache diary , participation study end . Weekly Telephone Follow-Up Calls : Research staff call participant weekly check compliance drug diary use first month study ( Weekly call 1-3 ) check compliance diary usage . For weekly call week 5-11 ( intervention participant ) , research staff inquire study drug usage , query adverse event . Use rescue medication headache record . In case minor adverse effect bothersome patient , dosage decrease Â½ pill per use . Follow Visit ( Visit 3 ) . This final visit subject . Vital sign obtain . Drug container headache diary collect subject . Outcome measure administer . Use sumatriptan rescue drug : Two package nine ( 9 ) sumatriptan 100- mg. pill ( 18 pill total 2 month treatment ) dispense subject Day 30 go baseline assessment . On average , treat minimum 5 headache maximum 9 headache per month . Subjects instructed take sumatriptan onset headache pain . If subject pain free 2 hour first dose study medication , allow take one additional pill , limit 2 pill 24 hour period . Subjects instruct take 9 pill 30 day period base research suggest additional dosage may increase risk medication-overuse headache . A list appropriate medication provide use : 1 ) continue headache pain 2 hour second dose study drug , 2 ) use 30 day supply study drug within month . All subject contact telephone weekly basis review headache diary , assess potential adverse event , review compliance use study drug , ass treatment utilized , answer question . Data Analysis : Data analysis feasibility safety aim primarily descriptive . The investigator calculate percent subject use diary successfully , percent stop take sumatriptan side effect , percent experience adverse event , percent able maintain compliance treatment . A confidence interval determine estimate . To get preliminary data efficacy sumatriptan , headache control compare participant start take sumatriptan . The investigator calculate percent headache complete resolution ( pain free 2 hour ) person , initial ( pre-intervention ) month use regular treatment two month ( intervention ) treat headache sumatriptan compare use paired t-test . The investigator also examine different definition headache relief ( pain free 30 minute , mild pain ( score &lt; =1 ) 30 minute , mild pain 2 hour ) see another outcome measure may advantage future Phase III study . Any difference compliance , side effect , feasibility base cognitive functioning described , well self-report emotional health measure . Changes measure pre post treatment also examine determine whether change occur treatment may important variable include Phase III study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 1865 . The low age limit set ability consent adult research participation well minimum age administration validate outcome measurement . The high age limit set 65 reduce likelihood health issue may contraindication use sumatriptan meet recommendation International Headache Society.62 Diagnosis TBI occur least 3 month great 60 month enrollment . Three month choose include subject headache beyond acute injury 60 month identify ability individual TBI headache use headache diary medication . Subject least four maximum fifteen total headache day per month . Subject report meeting criterion result subject enter first month study . However , frequency must document headache diary enter treatment phase study . Headaches classify moderate severe ( 2 3 4 point pain scale : 0=no headache , 1=mild headache , 2=moderate headache , 3=severe headache ) . As , headache severity must document monthlong headache diary prior entry treatment phase . Subject able willing give write informed consent participation screen activity participate fully study eligible . For subject score 25 Mini Mental Status Examination , must caregiver willing also consent participation study . Female subject childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test enrollment , agree remain abstinent use acceptable method birth control ( i.e. , hormonal contraceptive , intrauterine device , diaphragm spermicide , cervical cap sponge , condom , partner vasectomy ) . Sumatriptan assign pregnancy category C FDA . Animal study reveal evidence decrease fetal body weight , embryo lethality , cervicothoracic vascular defect . There control data human pregnancy therefore , sumatriptan give pregnancy benefit outweighs risk . History ischemic heart disease ( angina pectoris , history myocardial infarction , silent ischemia , Prinzmetal 's angina/coronary vasospasm , ischemic bowel disease , peripheral vascular disease ) base selfreport history basilar hemiplegic migraine . Uncontrolled hypertension initial visit ( sit systolic pressure &gt; 140 mm Hg , diastolic pressure &gt; 90 mm Hg ) . Impaired renal liver function medical history . Subject take MAO inhibitor within 2 week screen drug sumatriptan use metabolic pathway . Subject hypersensitivity reaction intolerance sumatriptan 5HT 1B/1Dreceptor agonist . If subject medication overuse headache opinion investigator ( use medication treat acute headache 15 day per month ) . Inability speak read English would limit ability interact examiner complete headache diary questionnaire study .</criteria>
