	<brief_title>Safety Study Intravenous Immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) Post-Portoenterostomy Infants With Biliary Atresia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In multicenter prospective phase 1/2A open label trial , feasibility , tolerability safety intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIG ) therapy follow hepatic portoenterostomy ( HPE ) assess 29 infant biliary atresia ( BA ) , efficacy estimate exploratory mechanistic research study perform . After write consent obtain parent guardian , subject enrol receive three intravenous dos IVIG designate interval first 60 day follow HPE follow 360 day enrollment . Blood also obtain study assess potential mechanism IVIG may alter reduce bile duct inflammation injury improve bile flow . All infant trial also treat standardized dos routine standard-of-care treatment BA trial ( ursodeoxycholic acid , trimethoprim-sulfamethoxasole , fat-soluble vitamin supplement ) . This routine clinical care modify participation study . Subjects study receive corticosteroid therapy treatment biliary atresia , unproven benefit present time .</detailed_description>
