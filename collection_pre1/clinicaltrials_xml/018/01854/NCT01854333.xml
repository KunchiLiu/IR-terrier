	<brief_title>The Swedish Versions ADOS ADI-R : Psychometric Validation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objectives : The present study seek determine first time reliability validity Swedish version Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised ( ADI-R ) Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ( ADOS ) . The combination two assessment deem `` gold standard '' diagnose ASD international practice research . ADI-R ADOS widely use ( translated 15 language ) rigorously convincingly evaluated country . The Swedish translation ADI-R ( interview schedule , algorithm ) ADOS ( observation schedule , algorithm ) yet test scientific property feasibility , hamper best clinical practice , evidence-based diagnostics research premise ASD Sweden . Therefore , study aim standardize Swedish form ADI-R ADOS ensure cross-cultural validity clinical utility . A particular objective study establish agreement ADI-R ADOS register-based diagnosis . The latter paramount importance judge significance generalizability finding large scale register research , specific strength Swedish science . Instruments : The ADI-R clinical diagnostic instrument assess ASDs child , adolescent adult . The ADI-R provide diagnostic algorithm autism describe ICD-10 DSM-IV-TR necessary information make diagnosis ASD accord classification manual . The ADI-R appropriate child adult mental age 18 month . It standardize , semi-structured clinical review caregiver child , adolescent adult . The interview contain 93 item three content area : quality social interaction , communication language , repetitive , restrict stereotyped interest behavior . The measure also include item relevant treatment planning , self-injury over-activity . Responses score clinician base caregiver 's description child 's behavior . All question ask current behavior , exception behavior occur specific age period . In addition ask current behavior , question focus time period behavior likely pronounce - generally , age 4 5 year . The interview start introductory question follow question subject 's early development . The next 41 question cover verbal nonverbal communication . Questions 50 66 ask social development play . The next 13 question deal interest behavior . The final 14 question ask `` general behavior , '' include question memory skill , motor skill , over-activity fainting . The ADI-R interview generates score three content area . Elevated score indicate problematic behavior particular area . Scores base clinician 's judgment follow caregiver 's report child 's behavior development . For item , clinician give score range 0 ( autistic ) 3 ( severely autistic ) . A classification autism give score three content area communication , social interaction , pattern behavior meet exceed specify cutoff , onset disorder evident 36 month age . For ASD information ADI-R use informally : e.g . diagnosis Asperger syndrome indicate , criterion autism fulfil face normal language development , diagnosis PDD-NOS , social interaction deficit another behavior domain exceed cut-offs . This interviewer-based instrument require substantial train administration score . A trained clinician administer ADI-R parent child suspect autism approximately 2 Â½ hour . The ADOS semi-structured assessment communication , social interaction play imaginative use material individual suspect autism ASD . It consist four module ( plus new toddler module ) , appropriate child , adolescent adult differ developmental language level , range expressive receptive language verbally fluent adult . The ADOS build standard activity allow examiner observe occurrence non-occurrence behavior identify important diagnosis ASDs across developmental level chronological age . The examiner select module appropriate particular child , adolescent adult basis his/her expressive language level chronological age . Structured activity material , less structured interaction , provide standard context social , communicative behavior relevant ASDs observe . In effect , ADOS provide 30 60 minute observation period examiner present individual assess numerous opportunity exhibit behavior interest diagnosis ASD standard 'presses ' communication social interaction . Module 1 intend individual consistently use phrase speech Module 2 intend individual phrase speech verbally fluent . Module 3 intend child play toys age- appropriate verbally fluent . Module 4 intend verbally fluent adolescent adult . Though superficial appearance different module quite vary , general principle involve deliberate variation examiner 's behavior use hierarchy structure unstructured social behavior . The standardization ADOS lie hierarchy behavior employed examiner kind behavior take account activity overall rating . The activity serve structure interaction ; end . The object test specific cognitive ability skills activity , task sufficiently intrigue child adult assess want participate . What examiners often important . The ADOS trivial administer , priori training advise even experienced clinician . The module consist 10 15 activity 31 accompany item code . Comparable ADI-R , item score 0 3 depend presence severity observe symptom . Subsets item module use generate diagnostic algorithm module . Items thresholds classification autism ASDs differ module . In new diagnostic algorithm , classification make basis exceed threshold social affect ( social communication domain combine ) , restrict repetitive behavior total score . Studies reliability ( e.g . internal consistency , inter rater , retest ) validity ( e.g . diagnostic ) original many international adaptation ADI-R ADOS satisfactory excellent throughout . For instance , initial work psychometric property English ADI-R show multi rater weight Kappas almost exclusively exceed .65 algorithms item , internal consistency range .69 ( stereotypies ) .95 ( social interaction domain ) item retest reliability mean weighted Kappa = .72 . Diagnostic validity study show classification accuracy 94 % compare clinical expert consensus diagnosis . Comparable data available example German , Bulgarian , Greek Dutch version . The recently present revise diagnostic algorithm ADOS show sensitivity &gt; .91 specificity &gt; .84 discrimination autism non-spectrum condition N = 1630 individual least word speech . The diagnostic validity new algorithms cross-validated also demonstrate excellent psychometric value independent cross-cultural study . Procedure complementary assessment : Located clinical site Karolinska Institute Center Neurodevelopmental Disorders ( KIND ) , examine subject suspicion ASD , mental disorder typically develop use ADI-R ADOS . Testing general intellectual ability also carried-out use Wechsler Intelligence Scales Children-IV , multidimensional IQ test-battery determine general IQ , performance verbal IQ well profile intellectual capacity . They comprise core supplemental subtests form composite neuropsychological score . In addition , Raven matrix collect , especially cover ASD case show problem IQ test use Wechsler 's , e.g . due low IQ low verbal skill . Before use instrument , involve researcher receive extend training scale applicant , certificate clinical neuropsychologist recognize ADI-R ADOS trainer . Other Swedish trainer ADI-R ADOS ( Vivianne Nordin , Eric Zander , Karin Olafsdottir ) include assessment . For subsequent inter rater reliability analyse administration videotape . Up 10 independent raters skilled ADI-R ADOS , blind child 's diagnosis history , rate video course study . In order determine retest reliability half participant re-examined three month independent examiner . Independent DSM-IV-TR/ICD-10 consensus diagnose participant establish experienced clinician ( child psychiatrist , clinical child psychologist ) . Work plan : Study 1 : Reliability ADI-R 1 . Internal consistency calculate three ADI-R algorithm behavior domain scale : social interaction , communication , repetitive-stereotyped behavior use Cronbach 's alpha . 2 . Multirater reliability determine ADI-R four independent raters algorithm item , three behavior domain overall diagnosis use % agreement , ( weight ) Kappa Pearson product moment correlation . 3 . Retest reliability ADI-R compute three-month interval algorithm item , three behavior domain overall diagnosis use % agreement , ( weight ) Kappa Pearson product moment correlation . Study 2 : Reliability ADOS 1 . Internal consistency calculate three ADOS algorithm behavior domain scale : social interaction , communication , repetitive-stereotyped behavior use Cronbach 's alpha . 2 . ADOS multi-rater reliability determine four independent raters algorithm item , three behavior domain overall diagnosis use % agreement , ( weight ) Kappa Pearson product moment correlation . 3 . Retest reliability ADOS compute three-month interval algorithm item , three behavior domain overall diagnosis use % agreement , ( weight ) Kappa Pearson product moment correlation . Significance/patient gain/impact : The value impact study clinical practice research ASD Sweden pointed-out several time application . ASD rare disorder , affect 1 % general population , cause substantial burden affected individual , family society . The combined usage ADI-R ADOS view gold standard diagnose ASD international child adolescent psychiatry . They also valuable tool intervention educational planning , unlike many scale , continuously update improve . Their introduction decisive progress many field basic apply ASD research . Most guideline diagnose treat ASD professional Societies list first choice instrument . Both adapt successfully evaluate many language culture . Thus consider best clinical practice scale ASD . Unfortunately , yet standardize Sweden , impede well clinical practice patient , availability evidence-based instrument clinician , research prerequisite ASD Sweden . The present study aim fill gap , broadly establish reliability validity Swedish translation ADI-R ADOS . In summary , study aim long-term improvement clinical scientific structure Sweden . Its impact mean enhance evidence-based clinical practice patient expert stimulation internationally competitive ASD research Sweden . Department/research team : The study conduct Center Neurodevelopmental Disorders Karolinska Institutet ( KIND ) , Stockholm , Sweden . KIND competence center research , education development child adolescent psychopathology . KIND 's mission mutually connect research KI clinical service Stockholm County order generate research result high clinical significance patient gain . Regarding development clinical service research structure , construction , adaptation evaluation clinical scale core objective KIND .</detailed_description>
