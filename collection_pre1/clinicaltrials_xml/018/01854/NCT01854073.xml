	<detailed_description>Management prolong labor represent challenging area daily obstetric practice . In 1993 , Handa Laros define arrest active phase labor , failure labor progress 2 hour , 1994 , WHO propose labor management partograph protraction define &lt; 1cm/hour cervical dilatation minimum 4 hour .

Hyoscine butyl bromide spasmolytic drug act competitive antagonism acetyl choline post ganglionic parasympathetic nerve end . It claim reduce duration labor accelerate cervical dilatation without major side effect . It reduce spasm smooth muscle . Although efficacy Hyoscine proven various study clear evidence recommend routine use management prolong labor . The objective current study determine use Hyoscine antispasmodic drug management prolong labor nulliparous woman term , manage accord standard intrapartum protocol .</detailed_description>
