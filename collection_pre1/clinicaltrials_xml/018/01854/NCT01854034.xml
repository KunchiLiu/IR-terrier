	<brief_summary>This research study Phase II clinical trial , test safety effectiveness investigational drug learn whether drug work treat specific cancer . `` Investigational '' mean drug study . It also mean FDA yet approve drug type cancer use outside research study . It find people NSCLC change ( mutation ) certain gene call EGFR gene . This mutated gene help cancer cell grow . The majority NSCLC patient EGFR mutation achieve good outcome erlotinib EGFR inhibitor therapy , high response rate , prolong progression-free survival possibly improve overall survival therapy . However , 4 % EGFR mutant patient harbor exon 20 insertion mutation historically reap little benefit EGFR-directed therapy due low affinity mutation direct EGFR inhibitor , especially erlotinib gefitinib ( see Yasuda et al , Lancet Oncol 2011 ) . This group patient ideal study target therapeutic strategy could affect oncogene mutation EGFR via alternative mechanism . AUY922 investigational drug may stop cancer cell grow abnormally . This drug use research study . Information research study suggest AUY922 may effective kill cancer cell patient exon 20 insertion mutation EGFR . The purpose study test safety AUY922 determine well AUY922 work participant advance NSCLC exon 20 insertion mutation EGFR .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Interested patient ask undergo screening test procedure confirm eligible . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn patient take part research study . If patient test procedure recently , may may repeat . These test procedure include : medical history physical exam , performance status , assessment tumor , EKG , electrocardiogram multigated acquisition scan , eye exam , blood draw , blood pregnancy test , urine test collection piece store tumor tissue . The study treatment give 21 day cycle . AUY922 give IV ( vein ) . This call infusion . Patients receive infusion AUY922 day 1 , 8 15 cycle ( per week ) . The infusion take 60 minute . A schedule clinic visit study summarize . Cycle 1 , Day 1 : physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight ; performance status ; EKG ; blood draw ; routine urine test Cycle 1 , Day 2 : EKG Cycle 1 , Day 3 : EKG Cycle 1 , Day 8 : Vital sign , performance status , EKG , question side effect medication take Cycle 1 , Day 15 : Physical exam , include measurement vital sign , performance status ; EKG ; blood draw ; question side effect medication take Note Cycle 1 patient need stay ( return ) clinic last EKG follow Day 1 AUY922 infusion , come clinic Days 2 3 EKGs . Cycle 2 beyond , Day 1 : physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight ; performance status ; EKG ; blood draw ; question side effect medication take ; routine urine test Cycle 2 beyond , Day 8 : Vital sign ; performance status ; EKG ; question side effect medication take Cycle 2 beyond , Day 15 : Physical exam , include measurement vital sign ; performance status ; EKG ; blood draw ; question side effect medication take . Additional EKGs may do time study doctor think necessary . A blood test measure amount cardiac enzymes blood may do whenever abnormal finding suspect see EKG . Additional test procedure : - CT MRI scan do measure disease every 6 week . - A blood pregnancy test , woman become pregnant , perform every 6 week point pregnancy suspect . - A standard eye exam do Cycle 3 , Day 1 . Additional eye exams do patient experience eye-related symptom , change vision . Within 1 week last dose study drug AUY922 , patient ask return clinic . At visit follow do : physical examination , performance status , EKG , ECHO MUGA scan , blood draw , urine test , eye exam , question side effect medication take . Patients ask return clinic second time investigator follow-up ongoing side effect stop AUY922 .</detailed_description>
