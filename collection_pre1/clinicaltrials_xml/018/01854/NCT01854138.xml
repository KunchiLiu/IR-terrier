	<brief_summary>Determine extent application Prevena vacuum system clean surgical incision immediately follow surgical procedure ( total hip total knee arthroplasty ) reduce rate : - readmission hospital surgical intervention due wound complication - seroma - hematoma - infection compare group patient whose wound cover traditional gauze dressing .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Advantages Prevena After Hip Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aim research project determine effect use Prevena vacuum system rate repeat surgical procedure surgical site complication patient undergone total knee hip arthroplasty . It believe negative pressure wound therapy effective promotion heal complicate , non-healing , infected wound many setting . In light exist evidence , investigator believe apply negative pressure wound therapy clean incision , orthopedic setting , infection complication occur may prevent complication low overall cost care patient undergoing total hip knee arthroplasty . The investigator ' primary hypothesis application Prevena vacuum system clean incision operate room patient undergone total knee arthroplasty hip replacement surgery reduce occurrence repeat surgery system remain place functional seven day follow application . Prevena ideal system patient population best suit non-draining wound ; hip knee arthroplasty result often non-draining wound , evidence suggest less likely become infect cause complication . Secondary hypothesis test study application use Prevena vacuum system patient undergone total knee arthroplasty hip replacement surgery reduce occurrence seromas , hematoma , also reduce occurrence surgical site infection system remain place functional seven day application . Additionally , investigator wish compare level pain experience patient use Prevena system surgery comparison whose incision sit covered traditional dressing . The investigator hypothesize patient whose wound dress Prevena system experience less pain patient whose wound dress traditional dressing , may quite bulky carry risk tape trauma injury . Finally , investigator hypothesize Prevena system prevent surgical site complication may lead repeat procedure , cost treating patient Prevena low total relative cost treating patient whose wound dress traditional dressing .</detailed_description>
