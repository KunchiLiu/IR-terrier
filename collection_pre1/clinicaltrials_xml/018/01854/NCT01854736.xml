	<brief_summary>This trial exploratory randomise , parallel-group , double-blind , placebo- control , national , single-centre trial . The trial initiated 2013 grass pollen season subject randomise September 2013 receive active treatment ( Grazax® ) placebo 2 year . Placebo group treat 2 year placebo third year active therapy ( Grazax® ) active group continue active treatment third year .

	<detailed_description>There first stage clinical trial ( GT-20 ) ALK- Abelló directly work MEICA project explore human immunological mechanism SIT ( observed Grazax® treatment ) . In trial , different potential biomarkers early sustain effect specific immunotherapy identify . Therefore , research , necessary carry new clinical double blind placebo control trial evaluate select panel biomarkers apply selection monitoring patient immunotherapy . They value evaluation future product candidate specific immunotherapy . For purpose , necessary Biomarkers select , clearly differentiate active placebo treat group . Moreover , specific immunological change difference active placebo patient pollen season unknown . This first study allow u identify potential set biomarkers time point might correlate treatment effect . This second study need evaluate potential biomarkers discriminate placebo treat patient necessary step incorporate big prospective efficacy study . A third year active IMP design two year double blind placebo setup include way validate difference observe intergroup first year therapy . This need pollen season significantly differ strength duration . Moreover , unique opportunity analyse immunological change intervention careful baseline monitoring patient undergoing placebo treatment , opportunity understanding immunological clue natural evolution allergy disease .</detailed_description>
