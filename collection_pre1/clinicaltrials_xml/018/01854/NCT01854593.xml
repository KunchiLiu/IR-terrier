	<brief_summary>We hypothesize reduce adverse effect intravitreal bevacizumab ocular tissue whole body , intravitreal injection low concentration bevacizumab conduct vitrectomy shortly injection useful . In present prospective , double-masked , randomize , control study , aim verify usefulness intravitreal injection 0.16 mg/0.05 ml bevacizumab one day conduct vitrectomy PDR .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Randomized Controlled Study Intravitreal Injection Bevacizumab Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Early postoperative hemorrhage proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) patient major complication . Intravitreal injection anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) report reduce vitreous hemorrhage . Recently , numerous report show efficacy reduce neovascularization activity vitrectomy preoperative intravitreal injection anti-VEGF agent . When intravitreal bevacizumab ( IVB ) injection use adjunct therapy , shortterm effect need . Because report adverse event cause bevacizumab injection . Hattori et al report intravitreal injection 0.16 mg/0.05 ml bevacizumab PDR patient mark blockage intravitreal VEGF concentration pilot study . The purpose study evaluate low dose intravitreal bevacizumab preoperative adjunct therapy reduce postoperative vitreous hemorrhage . This study involve PDR patient underwent vitrectomy May 2012 August 2013 Surugadai Hospital Nihon University . The risk participant accompany intravitreal injection bevacizumab ( especially possibility endophthalmitis thromboembolic event ) . Between June 2012 August 2013 , one investigator ( AM ) randomize PDR patient indication primary 25-gauge vitrectomy sham group IVB group . One day injection , three surgeon except AM conducted surgery . Vitreous sample collect start surgery , intraoperative postoperative complication evaluate .</detailed_description>
