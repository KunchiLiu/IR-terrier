	<brief_summary>In previous study demonstrate endogenous opioids ( inhibitory neuropeptides ) modulate perception breathe difficulty patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) ( ERJ 2009 ; 33:771 ; J COPD 2011 ; 8:160 ) . Recently , find antagonism substance P ( excitatory neuropeptide ) aprepitant affect perception breathe difficulty . However , administration aprepitant , blood level substance P ( + 54 ± 39 % ) beta-endorphin ( + 27 ± 17 % ) increase significantly . As blood level reflect cellular/tissue activity , postulate concomitant release excitatory ( substance P ) inhibitory ( beta-endorphin ) neuropeptides oppose effect ( counterbalance ) perception breathe difficulty . The objective present study examine possible role substance P perception breathlessness . We propose administer oral aprepitant oral placebo randomize clinical trial patient COPD . However , four hour patient take medication , intravenous naloxone administer order block effect endogenous opioids ( beta-endorphin ) opioid receptor . Five minute later , patient breathe thru tube fine wire mesh provoke breathe difficulty , provide rating intensity unpleasantness breathlessness every minute . The two compete hypothesis study : 1. breathlessness rating aprepitant/naloxone = placebo/naloxone , substance P effect perception breathe difficulty ; 2. breathlessness rating aprepitant/naloxone ≠ placebo/naloxone , substance P effect perception breathe difficulty .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study randomize , control clinical trial compare acute effect oral aprepitant ( selective antagonist substance P receptor ) vs. placebo rating breathlessness resistive load breathe patient COPD . Four hour randomization , patient receive intravenous naloxone ( antagonist opioid receptor ) block effect endogenous opioids perception breathlessness . The two compete hypothesis study : Breathing difficulty induce patient breathing thru tube fine wire mesh approximately 10 - 20 minute laboratory ( J COPD 2011 ; 8:160 ) . Approximately 20 patient COPD recruit out-patient clinic Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center . The population consist female male adult least 50 year age , least 10 pack-year history smoking , diagnosis COPD associate chronic bronchitis base standard criterion .</detailed_description>
