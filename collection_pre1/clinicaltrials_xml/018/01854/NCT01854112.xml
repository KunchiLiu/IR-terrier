	<brief_summary>Radiation therapy , total skin electron therapy ( TSET ) , achieve high response rate effective treatment cutaneous T-cell lymphoma affect superficial region 1 . One widely use TSET technique consist six dual field initially develop Stanford University 2 . Dosimetrically , TSET energies 3-7 MeV surface stand patient may result significant dose variation due variable skin distance , self shield , irradiated field overlap patient motion . Deviations occur prescription dose 40 % surface dose inhomogeneity much 90 % body area perineum eyelid , revealed literature . To improve condition , selection patient advance skin disease regional extension could cure combination TSEB photon beam irradiation . Helical tomotherapy ( HT ) advantage irradiate extend volume treatment length 160 cm , continuously helical pattern without need field junction . Total marrow irradiation ( TMI ) via HT low toxicity bone marrow transplantation Asia multiple myeloma patient could feasible . A study HT total scalp irradiation also show employment directional complete block inner structure effectively force tangential delivery majority beamlets PTV , limit treatment depth . Using HT , image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy , replace conventional TSI technique increase dose delivery decrease toxicity could workable feasible . Here , apply TSI via HT ( HITS ) woman T cell lymphoma failure chemotherapy , topic UV irradiation local radiotherapy ( RT ) MMH overcome surface dose inhomogeneity conventional RT . Additionally , compare advantage disadvantage plan HT conventional RT TSI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Helical tomotherapy planning Patient dress dive suit ( 3 mm thick ) create bolus effect . AccuFix™ Cantilever Board™ shoulder depression thermoplastic fixation use head shoulder immobilization . BlueBagTM immobilization system ( Medical Intelligence ) use fix main trunk extremity . Both immobilization system provide consistent treatment position initial compute tomography ( CT ) scanning , pretreatment megavoltage CT ( MVCT ) image final treatment delivery . For tomotherapy treatment planning , CT image set whole body require . The patient scan large bore ( 75 cm ) CT scanner ( Siemens , SOMATOM Definition , Dual source compute tomography system ) . Because critical organ locate central part body , therefore two image set scan 2.5 mm 5 mm upper low part , respectively . The level 15 cm knee use reference point separate upper low set . The geometric edge field abut HT treatment 's 50 % isodose plane . Both image set restore Pinnacle workstation use Pinnacle Launch Pad Restore utility use Philips Pinnacle3 treatment planning system contour HT planning system capability . After , plan transfer Tomotherapy Hi Art Planning system ( Tomotherapy , Inc. , Madison , Wisconsin , USA ) . The clinical target volume ( CTV ) include entire body surface system subcutaneous 0.5 cm . To account set-up variability breathe motion , plan target volume ( PTV ) generate 0.5 cm margin The prescription dose 75 cGy/fraction 4 times/wk total skin area tumor area . Total dose 30 Gy 95 % PTV deliver total skin area tumor part , respectively . The normal tissue dose constraint utilized base result survey clinical outcome target dose dose limit various organ risk ( OARs ) brain , optic chiasm , optic nerve , lens , eye , parotid gland , oral cavity , thyroid gland , bilateral lung , esophagus , heart , liver , spleen , pancreas , kidney , bowel , bladder , uterus vagina . Maximum importance give target dose coverage . The constraint dose penalty adjust accordingly optimization . The field width , pitch , modulation factor ( MF ) use treatment plan optimization 2.5 , 0.287 cm , 3.5 , respectively . The dose volume histogram ( DVHs ) calculate target individual OARs . Toxicity treatment score accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events v4.0 ( CTCAE v4.0 ) . Image guidance : Daily check patient positioning perform MVCT system integrate tomotherapy machine . Briefly , every treatment , MVCT scan take selected region use normal mode ( 4 mm slice thickness ) body fuse treatment planning CT scan use bony anatomy soft tissue image lung . Three set MVCT scan ( scan 1 , orbit T4 ; scan 2 , T10 ischial tuberosity ; scan 3 , 15 cm knee 15 cm knee ) perform check patient 's whole body alignment . MVCT scan obtain . Image fusion evaluate attend physician physicist . Any translational shift suggest image fusion result apply final patient setup treatment delivery . The tolerance setup error allow 5-mm difference three scan three translation direction 1° difference roll . Additional select MVCT scan perform treatment verify patient immobilization .</detailed_description>
