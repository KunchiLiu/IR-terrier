	<brief_summary>Background : - The Idebenone Patients With Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis ( IPPoMS ) trial test new drug multiple sclerosis . In IPPoMS trial , participant take either idebenone placebo . Researchers want give idebenone participant 1 year . It still certain whether idebenone slow progression multiple sclerosis , study may help answer question . Objectives : - To provide idebenone participant IPPoMS trial . - To collect data safety effectiveness idebenone primary progressive multiple sclerosis . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age complete 3 year IPPoMS trial . Design : - The first study visit trial happen day last visit IPPoMS trial . - Participants provide blood sample lumbar puncture . They also receive new supply idebenone take three time day food . They keep diary report side effect . - After first treatment visit , participant two follow-up visit NIH 6 month apart . These visit may schedule multiple day . Participants provide blood urine sample . They also image study brain spine . - Participants phone call study researcher provide updates condition side effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : A Phase I/II clinical trial conduct investigate safety , therapeutic efficacy mechanism action idebenone primary-progressive multiple sclerosis ( PP-MS ) patient ( IPPoMS ( Protocol Number 09-N-0197 ) . Patients complete 2-year treatment period IPPoMS , may enter open-label extension study ( IPPoMS-E ) find eligible Investigator desire treatment idebenone despite remain blinded allocation active treatment versus placebo IPPoMS trial . The aim open-label extension study gather additional data safety , efficacy effect idebenone CSF biomarkers patient period 1 year . This study provide open-label idebenone patient PP-MS , previously randomize idebenone placebo blind phase IPPoMS . STUDY POPULATION : Patients previously enrol IPPoMS ( Protocol Number 09-N-0197 ) invite participate trial . The idebenone dose use randomized clinical trial ( 2250 mg/day ) use study . DESIGN : This single group , open-label safety efficacy extension trial one year treatment period . Patient-specific biomarkers disease progression , CSF biomarkers oxidative stress , longitudinal neuroimaging include quantitative measure CNS tissue destruction clinical data collect randomized study . OUTCOME MEASURES : The measurement collection data perform randomized trial . Quantitative neuroimaging measure central nervous system ( CNS : i.e . brain spinal cord ) tissue destruction clinical functional measure neurological disability collect every 6-12 month . Additionally , biomarkers focus analysis reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) oxidative stress collect every 12 month . The primary outcome measure define IPPoMS trial also utilized IPPoMS-E. For patient originally randomize placebo , patient-specific slope disease progression 2 year placebo therapy ( measure primary secondary outcome ) compare patient-specific slope disease progression 1 year open label idebenone therapy . Combination IPPoMS IPPoMS-E trial significantly expand pair therapy vs. idebenone therapy CSF sample biomarker study . It also provide ( subgroup subject originally randomize idebenone ) longitudinal CSF sample idebenone therapy ( collect 2 year apart ) . This allow calculation intra-individual change CSF biomarkers idebenone therapy , may provide important insight mechanism action idebenone PP-MS .</detailed_description>
