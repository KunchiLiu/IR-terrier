	<brief_summary>Breast cancer commonly occur cancer woman . Currently , breast conservation surgery ( BCS ) treatment often prescribe . BCS involve remove tumor conserve great amount healthy breast tissue . Under standard white light , tumor border difficult surgeon visualize . Therefore , 30-70 % patient require second operation remove remain cancerous tissue n't detect initial surgery . Thus , urgent clinical need new image tool improves tumor visualization first surgery . PRODIGI , new hand-held optical imaging device , use safe violet-blue light detect fluorescence signal tissue . Different tissue associate specific fluorescent color therefore device use differentiate tumor healthy breast tissue . Based previous clinical data , PRODIGI distinguish tumor normal tissue , specific enough detect difference across breast tumor type . The fluorescent contrast drug 5-aminolevulinic acid ( 5-ALA ) accumulate tumor naturally previous research show 5-ALA increase tumor-normal tissue fluorescence contrast . In observational clinical study , PRODIGI 5-ALA use visualize tumor border BCS . 5-ALA induced fluorescent image surgical sample surgical bed obtain PRODIGI compare retrospectively image take standard white light and/or autofluorescence . The technology 's ability accurately identify tumor border well conventional practice confirm tissue pathology .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator hypothesize 5-ALA selectively increase breast tumor-to-normal fluorescent contrast therefore increase tumor margin delineation use PRODIGI device compare standard white light autofluorescence visualization . The goal observational study use intraoperative fluorescence imaging across three patient cohort ( control , 15mg/kg 5-ALA , 30mg/kg 5-ALA ) determine increase tumor-specific fluorescence contrast , select optimum 5-ALA contrast agent dose . All patient across cohort receive conventional BCS care independent contrast agent dose . Data preliminary study use guide design future statistically power randomize control trial involve PRODIGI 5-ALA . However , early stage initial aim develop baseline understand 5-ALA fluorescent signature normal tumor breast tissue surgical setting . This technology potential guide surgeon BCS reduce re-incision rate ensure surgeon properly identify tumor normal tissue surgery . If successful , new fluorescence image technology may improve patient outcomes reduce likelihood cancer recurrence , accelerate recovery process decrease healthcare cost eliminate need second surgery .</detailed_description>
