	<brief_title>Capsule Endoscopy Versus Conservative Therapy Obscure Gastrointestinal Bleeding</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although American Gastroenterological Association suggest patient obscure GI bleeding undergo capsule endoscopy negative esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) colonoscopy , current recommendation British Society Gastroenterology argue unless inadequate response iron therapy , image small bowel probably necessary . Several study demonstrate approach reasonably safe . Furthermore , Laine et al demonstrated patient obscure GI bleeding randomize either capsule endoscopy dedicate small bowel contrast radiography , rate bleed , measure subsequent hospitalization blood transfusion event , similar two group . No study randomize patient obscure GI bleed receive capsule endoscopy vs. conservative therapy oral iron . This study single center prospective randomize control trial compare utility perform capsule endoscopy compare conservative management oral iron therapy initial course action patient non-severe obscure occult obscure overt gastrointestinal bleeding . All patient recruit G.I . clinic , endoscopy unit , inpatient consults negative upper endoscopy colonoscopy . The study explain patient qualify time . During visit , patient question regard low upper G.I . symptom , include abdominal pain , dyspepsia , nausea , vomit , weight loss , diarrhea , change stool character , melena intermittent hematochezia . All patient start standard dose oral iron therapy inform consent . If patient already take iron supplement , dose adjust standard regimen inform consent . Patients randomize undergo capsule endoscopy . For patient randomize undergo capsule endoscopy , subsequent evaluation treatment determine capsule finding ( i.e . capsule direct management ) standard care institution . Patients follow 1 year . Follow lab draw occur 1 , 3 , 6 12 month . They consist complete blood count ( CBC ) ferritin perform either Medical University South Carolina ( MUSC ) outside facility office . If perform outside MUSC , standard medical record release form utilized obtain lab information . Patients provide paper card indicate date enrollment study . This card keep patient entire 12 month follow period collect end follow period . The card area patient write date first blood transfusion enrollment . There also numerical checkboxes patient check unit packed red blood cell ( RBCs ) receive 12 month follow period . Telephone call make patient every 3 month enrollment inquire hospitalization bleed related procedure ( include endoscopy , capsule , small bowel radiology , interventional radiology surgery ) . Records hospitalization procedure obtain use standard medical record release form .</detailed_description>
