	<brief_summary>In research study investigator want learn risk develop blood vessel heart disease night-time sleep apnea . Sleep apnea condition result block throat sleep . This study examine change blood pressure , blood vessel stiffness , heart size level specific substance blood may cause heart disease . This study child age 5 13 year . The study involve 3 visit 18 month . The first last visit include overnight sleep study ( polysomnography PSG ) . All visit include : - body measurement measure growth weight distribute , - rest blood pressure measurement , - heart measurement ( electrocardiogram ultrasound heart blood vessel ) , - 36 hour home ambulatory blood pressure measurement , - blood test look thing like fat , cholesterol , inflammatory factor , - questionnaires Optional part study include DNA child 8 year old , test questionnaire learn sleep relates learn , memory behavior issue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Research Study Children About Heart Changes Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design primarily investigate change blood vessel compliance stiffness child age 5 13 year syndrome obstructive breathing sleep . It design examine relationship severity syndrome vascular function specific inflammatory mediator relate early stage arterial stiffness effect cardiovascular end-points , namely twenty-hour ambulatory blood pressure leave ventricular mass . The study also examine relationship plasma tonsillar tissue level inflammatory cytokine , well relationship obstructive breathe sleep child 's attention problem-solving skill . Our aim identify vascular risk factor childhood determine whether sleep disorder breathe child represent independent risk factor cardiovascular disease neurodevelopmental deficit leave inadequately identify could track adult year - Hypothesis increase level inflammatory cytokine correlate severity OSA disorder . - Hypothesis severity OSA disorder correlate measure increase arterial wall stiffness , turn lead increase pulse pressure leave ventricular mass . This study examine vascular function child , lean obese , syndrome obstructive breathing sleep encompass child vary degree sleep disorder breathing ( SDB ) . Children include SDB group OSA 1 obstructive episode per hour sleep . The standard care child symptom obstructive breathe sleep otolaryngology practice undergo tonsillectomy adenoidectomy ( T &amp; A ) . Children SDB schedule T &amp; A follow 18 month compare child without SDB . To discern effect obesity vascular function effect sleep disorder breathing ( SDB ) , study consist four group . Two group , one lean one obese , SDB two group , one lean one obese , normal control . Efforts make match subject across group . There potential group contain number due difference incidence OSA relation weight . There 3 visit approximately 18 month . The first visit function qualify visit base Obstructive Index polysomnography ( OI &gt; 1 SDB group OI &lt; 1 snore control group ) . Visits approximately 9 month apart first last visit include overnight polysomnography ( PSG ) . Tonsillar tissue specimen obtain subset SDB subject schedule T &amp; A . Data capture include : - Blood measure high-sensitivity C reactive protein ( hsCRP ) , serum amyloid A , cytokine panel , fast lipoprotein analysis , complete blood count ( CBC ) , glucose , insulin direct renin DNA ( optional ) . - Tonsillar tissue measure hsCRP , serum amyloid A , cytokine panel . - Anthropometrics include height , weight , arm finger circumference , neck circumference , waist hip ratio , arm length . - Left ventricular structure vascular stiffness measurement include echocardiogram , carotid ultrasound , radial tonometry . - Resting blood pressure measurement include continuous beat beat BP recording obtain Portapres monitor ECG respiration monitor do throughout sleep PSG 30 minute awake morning . - Activity home ambulatory blood pressure ( AMBP ) measurements continuously monitor ( every 30 minute ) use automate oscillometric BP monitor 36 hour period simultaneously actigraphy . - Questionnaires sleep QOL . - A subset subject age 8 old participate neurobehavioral component include formal assessment attention problem-solving .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Normal control enrolled child sign informed consent complete initial polysomnography ; whose history reveal symptom obstructive breathing sleep ; polysomnogram consider normal . SDB group enrol child sign informed consent complete initial polysomnography OI &gt; 1 ; whose history include snoring , hypertrophy tonsil hypertrophied adenoid . Subjects assign study group base result overnight polysomnogram . Exclusion criterion : Children positive history snore without evidence AHI &gt; 1 follow tonsillectomy adenoidectomy surgery . Children chronic pulmonary condition include asthma ( child mild , intermittent asthma include define use rescue inhaler &lt; 1/wk unless treatment exercise induce asthma ) . Children cardiac disease Children neuromuscular disorder Children developmental delay Down syndrome Children chronic renal disease chronic pyelonephritis glomerulonephritis Children endocrinological disorder chronic steroid therapy include inhaled steroid . Children use medication influence autonomic nervous system adrenergic cholinergic drug , alpha beta blocker , drug parasympatholytic action . Children acute chronic inflammatory condition . Children BMI Z score exceeds 2.9 age gender . Children complete first 36 hour AMBP study 70 % success rate BP reading . Children history chronic recurrent tonsillitis ( parent physician report ) define 6 episode tonsillitis / year period one year ; 5 episode tonsillitis / year 2 year ; 4 episode tonsillitis / year 3 year .</criteria>
