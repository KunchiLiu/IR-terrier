	<brief_summary>Coronary artery disease ( CAD ) remain leading cause death country . It well know reduction cholesterol level statin therapy associate significant decrease plaque burden . REVERSAL , ASTEROID , recently SATURN II trial show patient CAD , lipid lower atorvastatin rosuvastatin respectively reduce progression coronary atherosclerosis , even cause plaque regression lesion . CAD clinical event related plaque instability due lipid content activity within atherosclerotic plaque . The investigator recently complete YELLOW I study , identify intensive statin therapy ( rosuvastatin 40mg ) associate reduction amount lipid obstructive coronary plaque , measure near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) . The YELLOW II study design expand build upon result , provide mechanistic insight potential benefit intensive statin therapy atherosclerotic plaque .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>YELLOW II Study : Reduction Coronary Yellow Plaque , Lipids Vascular Inflammation Aggressive Lipid Lowering</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>YELLOW II single site study assess regression plaque lipid content change plaque morphology atherosclerotic lesion high-dose statin therapy utilize NIRS , IVUS optical coherency tomography ( OCT ) image modality coronary artery . We propose image non-culprit coronary lesion use modality patient two three diseased coronary vessel deem warrant intervention clinical ground . Thus , time enrolment patient undergo Percutaneous Coronary Intervention ( PCI ) non-study culprit lesion , triple-modality image potential non-culprit ( 'YELLOW ' ) lesion . If high baseline lipid content non-culprit YELLOW lesion ( max 4mm LCBI &gt; 150 ) , patient formally enter study . Following , enrol subject receive high-dose lipid lower therapy ( rosuvastatin 40mg daily ) . The non-culprit YELLOW lesion undergo stag intervention 8-12 week follow study enrolment baseline imaging . At time YELLOW lesion reimaged determine whether high-dose statin therapy cause reduction lipid content assess NIRS , alter plaque morphology assess OCT IVUS . In addition , baseline time final non-culprit YELLOW lesion PCI , blood sample draw baseline follow-up procedure characterize reverse cholesterol transport ability patient HDL accept cholesterol cholesterol-laden ( mouse J774 ) macrophage ( cholesterol efflux ) effect patient HDL apolipoprotein A1 macrophage gene expression migration .</detailed_description>
