	<brief_summary>The Melanesian state Western Pacific ( Papua New Guinea , Solomon Islands Vanuatu ) represent unique especially prescient challenge malaria control elimination . While use bed net vector control case management measure achieve major advance overall malaria control , P. vivax P. ovale specie account ever-increasing burden clinical disease . The lack effective treatment hypnozoite stage infection specie result ongoing relapse continue reservoir infection . The known drug effective treatment hypnozoite stage primaquine ; however safe effective dose drug malaria treatment still unclear . A recent study evaluate safety efficacy two primaquine dose regimen ( 0.25mg/kg 0.5mg/kg ) population New Ireland province , PNG . This study aim replicate methodology Vanuatu Solomon Islands , provide complete picture primaquine efficacy safety three country region .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy Primaquine P. Vivax</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Aims Primary To define compare efficacy standard ( 0.25mg/kg/day 14 day ) high-dose ( 0.5mg/kg/day 14 day ) primaquine prevent early relapse P. vivax Solomon Islands Vanuatu . Secondary To measure safety toxicity primaquine administer standard high-dose regimen Melanesian adult child Solomon Islands Vanuatu .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Age 12 month 60 year 2 . Melanesian background live local area 3 . Microscopically ( base field microscopy ) RDT confirm P.vivax regardless parasite density . Mixed infection ( P.falciparumP.vivax P.malariaeP.vivax ) include . 1 . Any sign severe malaria ( see WHO definition ) include : impaired consciousness , respiratory distress , severe anaemia ( Hb &lt; 5 ) , multiple seizure , frequent vomiting/ inability swallow tablet , prostration , jaundice , hypotension , abnormal bleeding hypoglycaemia . 2 . Clinical evidence nonmalarial illness ( pneumonia otitis medium ) 3 . Severe malnutrition ( weightforage nutritional Z score [ WAZ ] &lt; 60th percentile ) 4 . Permanent disability , prevents impedes study participation . 5 . Treatment primaquine previous 14 day 6 . Residence plan travel outside study area followup period ( preclude supervise treatment followup procedure ) 7 . Known suspected pregnancy 8 . Currently breastfeed 9 . A positive rapid test G6PD deficiency ( Binax Carestart RDT ) Following later PCRbased confirmation malaria speciation , may posthoc exclusion subject think initial fieldbased microscopic diagnosis may incorrect .</criteria>
