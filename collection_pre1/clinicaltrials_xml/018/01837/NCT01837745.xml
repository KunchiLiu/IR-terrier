	<brief_summary>Open-label randomize phase III trial , use non-inferiority comparison design . After randomization , patient receive either post-operative radioiodine ablation activity 1.1 GBq ( 30 mCi ) stimulation rhTSH , followed-up ( ablation group ) followed-up ( without postoperative radioiodine ablation ) ( follow-up group ) . The objective ass non-inferiority proportion patient without tumor-related event evaluate three year randomisation absence radioiodine ablation ( follow-up group ) compare ablation group , patient low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer treat total thyroidectomy without lymph node dissection ( pT1am N0 Nx , pT1b N0 Nx )</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Patients differentiate thyroid cancer ( papillary , follicular Hurthle cell ) absence aggressive histological subtypes ( poorly differentiate , tallclearcylindric cell , diffuse sclerosing anaplastic component ) 2 . Patients undergone total thyroidectomy complete ( R0 ) tumor resection , without lymph node neck dissection 3 . Total thyroidectomy perform 2 5 month inclusion 4 . Patients low risk recurrence : pT1amN0 pT1amNx sum size lesion 1 cm equal less 2 cm , pT1bN0 pT1bNx ( TNM 2010 classification ) . ( Patients less 6 lymph node neck dissection classify Nx ) 5 .
