	<brief_summary>Compartment syndrome ( CS ) condition result increased pressure within compartment , compromise circulation lead critical limb ischemia . CS one big medical challenge soldier face battlefield related injury . Chronic exercise-induced compartment syndrome ( CS ) rarely require treatment ; acute compartment syndrome medical emergency require surgery . Treatment compartment syndrome limit fasciotomy , relieve pressure.The study purpose evaluate feasibility safety administration marrow-derived autologous bone marrow concentrate PRP gel generate point care marrow separation system treatment compartment syndrome . And show treatment possibly enhance wound healing , bone healing , perfusion , infection control , return limb function patient CS . Stem Cell regenerative medicine development effort therapeutic angiogenesis wound heal predominantly focus mechanism action single stem cell population achieve neovascularization improve tissue perfusion . It well document cell , include platelet , efficient carrier growth factor ( VEGF-PDGF , bFGF , SDF-1 ) play active role angiogenesis wound heal . Arteriocyte 's development effort focus concentration autologous bone marrow-derived stem cell platelets delivery site injury concentration sufficient effect local tissue revascularization repair . These product provide rapid , bedside preparation autologous PRP bone marrow stem cell concentrate . This clinical trial MagellanÂ® System preparation autologous cell concentrate treatment wound , tissue bone healing , improve perfusion , infection control , return limb function patient risk amputation .</brief_summary>
