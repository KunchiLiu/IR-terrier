	<brief_summary>This study determine safety efficacy drug , mebendazole , use combination standard chemotherapy drug treatment pediatric brain tumor . Mebendazole drug use treat infection intestinal parasite long track record safety human . Recently , discover mebendazole may effective treating cancer well , particular brain tumor . Studies use cell culture mouse model demonstrate mebendazole effective decreasing growth brain tumor cell . This study focus treatment category brain tumor call glioma . Low-grade glioma tumor arise glial cell central nervous system characterize slow , less aggressive growth high-grade glioma . Some low-grade glioma aggressive biology increase likelihood resistance recurrence . Low-grade glioma often able treated observation alone receive total surgical resection . However , tumor partially resect continue grow cause symptom , recur follow total resection require additional treatment , chemotherapy . Due aggressive nature , pilomyxoid astrocytomas , even totally resect , often treat chemotherapy . The current first-line treatment institution low-grade glioma involve three-drug chemotherapy regimen vincristine , carboplatin , temozolomide . However , base data historical control , 50 % patient pilomyxoid astrocytomas continue disease progression treatment . We believe mebendazole combination vincristine , carboplatin , temozolomide may provide additional therapeutic benefit increase progression-free overall survival low-grade glioma patient , particularly pilomyxoid astrocytomas . High grade glioma aggressive tumor poor prognosis . The standard therapy radiation therapy . A variety adjuvant chemotherapeutic combination use , disappointing result . For high-grade glioma study add mebendazole establish combination bevacizumab irinotecan determine combination safety efficacy</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I Study Mebendazole Treatment Pediatric Gliomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I/II study mebendazole combination standard care agent pediatric patient gliomas . Patients low-grade gliomas receive regimen mebendazole combination vincristine , carboplatin , temozolomide . Patients high-grade glioma diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma receive regimen mebendazole combination bevacizumab irinotecan . Surgical resection tumor attempt initially goal achieve gross total resection without substantial neurologic deficit . Subtotal resection may preferable depend location tumor . Optic pathway glioma diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma may remain unresected . Patients high-grade glioma diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma undergo local irradiation tumor begin protocol treatment . Low-grade glioma patient receive radiation therapy . Patients previously treat chemotherapy eligible study provide previously fail therapy chemotherapeutic agent . Patients eligible tumor consent enrollment study . The study patient divide two group ( low-grade glioma high-grade/pontine glioma ) purpose determine maximally tolerate dose mebendazole . These two group treat independently regard patient accrual , dose escalation , evaluation toxicity . In addition standard chemotherapy regimen , patient cohorts receive mebendazole . Mebendazole dose escalate initial dose level 50 mg/kg/day divide twice daily , second dose level 100 mg/kg/day divide twice daily , final dose level 200 mg/kg/day divide twice daily , cohort three patient per dose level . A standard `` 3+3 '' design use determine dose escalation . Phase I safety monitor low-grade group take place trial period begin start therapy end follow tenth week induction therapy . Phase I safety monitor high-grade/pontine glioma group take place trial period begin start maintenance therapy twelfth week maintenance therapy ( 3 cycle ) . After determination maximally tolerate dose group , study continue evaluate efficacy regimen . The study amend maximally tolerate dose group use remainder study . Patients currently study continue maintenance therapy . To document degree residual tumor , standard whole brain MRI without contrast ( gadolinium ) perform follow specify interval . Following completion therapy , patient continue monitor MRI assess progression-free overall-survival .</detailed_description>
