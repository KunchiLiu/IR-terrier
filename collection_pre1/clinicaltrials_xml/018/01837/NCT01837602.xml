	<criteria>Step 1 subject : metastatic breast cancer patient accessible tumor ( cutaneous , subcutaneous , superficial ) and/or palpable adenopathy/mass . The targeted tumor accessible ( i.e . near great vessel spinal cord ) surgically excise biopsied . Step 2 subject : Newly diagnose , operable , triple negative breast cancer , i.e . ER/PRnegative , her2/neunegative , tumor size 2 3 cm ( T2 ) measure either clinical breast exam , mammogram , ultrasound MRI , without ipsilateral axilla node involvement ( N0 N1 ) . cMet expression â‰¥ 30 % tumor cell demonstrate immunohistochemistry analysis archival slide . The intensity cMet IHC great equal 1+ . Punch biopsy percutaneous core biopsy may offer Cohort 1 patient . To establish eligibility patient step 1 , archival tumor tissue previously biopsied metastatic tumor deposit may use IHC stain . The metastatic tumor nodule target IT injection may necessarily previously biopsied metastatic site . Age &gt; 18 year old Baseline Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Clinical Performance Status 0 1 Adequate hematologic function : WBC &gt; 3.0 Plt &gt; 75,000 Hgb &gt; 10 g/dl Adequate renal function define serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 time upper limit normal Adequate hepatic function define : Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 time upper limit normal , ALT AST &lt; 2.5 time upper limit normal Women child bear potential must negative pregnancy test ( blood urine ) agree use appropriate contraception study screen duration trial . Men must agree use appropriate contraception IT injection duration trial . Signed date write informed consent . Step 1 subject : Targeted tumor near great vessel spinal cord Step 2 subject : Women already undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy treat primary triple negative breast cancer Step 1 2 subject : Positive HIV1/HIV2 Active hepatitis B hepatitis C infection The anticipate use follow within 2 week prior apheresis prior plan IT Tcell injection : Immunosuppressive drug Cytotoxic chemotherapy ( See Section 5.7 complete detail ) Systemic glucocorticoid ( steroid prep due dye allergy prior stag scan use antiemetic prophylaxis patient undergo chemotherapy allow ) Hematopoietic growth factor Other experimental therapy Note : Step 1 patient receive noninvestigational target therapy ( lapatinib , trastuzumab , and/or pertuzumab ) eligible provide medicine stable dose patient begin take 30 day prior plan IT Tcell injection . Anticipated use anticoagulant coumadin , heparin , Lovenox within 14 day plan IT Tcell injection RETIRED AS OF PROTOCOL VERSION 11 Pregnant woman nurse mother History alcohol abuse illicit drug use within 12 month IT Tcell injection Clinically significant comorbid disease underlie condition , include major autoimmune disorder would contraindicate study therapy confuse interpretation study result Significant psychiatric disorder reason Investigator 's opinion would jeopardize protocol compliance compromise patient 's ability give inform consent .
