	<brief_title>Efficacy Beta-Hydroxy-Beta-Methylbutyrate ( HMB ) Supplementation Hemodialysis Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients renal failure receive hemodialysis experience increase rate skeletal muscle protein catabolism associate number co-morbid condition include decline muscle mass strength , significantly increase fall risk , reduce quality life ( QOL . Therefore , intervention prevent muscle loss hemodialysis need . Pharmacological agent investigated treat muscle loss dialysis patient ; however , many treatment expensive undesirable side effect . As result , low-cost intervention design attenuate loss muscle mass strength hemodialysis patient need . Beta-hydroxy beta-methylbutyrate ( HMB ) represent potential low-cost nutritional intervention attenuate muscle loss hemodialysis patient . HMB metabolite amino acid leucine show safely increase muscle mass clinical population prevalent muscle loss , elderly , cancer , AIDS patient primarily reduction skeletal muscle protein catabolism . The primary purpose trial determine oral supplementation HMB attenuate muscle loss , improve muscle strength , physical function , fall risk QOL hemodialysis patient . Alterations protein gene expression associate skeletal muscle protein turnover measure investigate mechanism change primary outcome . We hypothesize HMB supplementation attenuate decline muscle size strength hemodialysis patient .</detailed_description>
