	<brief_summary>The study randomize , double-blind , placebo control cross-over study 32 adult subject moderately severe asthma . In study bronchodilator effect single morning dose FF/VI combination 100/25 mcg determine spirometry . After screen subject randomize assigned one two treatment sequence ( AB BA , A placebo B FF/VI 100/25 mcg ) . Between two treatment period washout period 7-14 day . A serial forced expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) measurements take 15 , 30 minute , 1 , 2 , 4 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , 60 72 hour post dose . Safety assessment include vital sign , electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , adverse event ( AE ) monitor laboratory safety test however , constitute study endpoint . The result study provide support information prescribers bronchodilator effect FF/VI 72 hour .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Asthma : A doctor diagnosis asthma . Age subject : 18 65 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . Severity Disease : A screening prebronchodilator FEV1 &gt; =60 % predict . Reversibility Disease : Demonstrated presence reversible airway disease screen . Current Therapy : On inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) without SABA least 12 week prior screen . Able stop current ShortActing Beta2Agonists ( SABA ) replace albuterol/salbutamol inhaler Body weight BMI : Body weight &gt; =50 kilogram ( kg ) Body Mass Index ( BMI ) within range 19.0 29.9 kilogram per square meter ( kg/m^2 ) ( inclusive ) . Gender : Male female . A female subject eligible participate : Nonchildbearing potential . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrollment . Childbearing potential agrees use one contraception method appropriate period time ( determined product label investigator ) prior start dose sufficiently minimize risk pregnancy point . Female subject must agree use contraception completion followup visit . Liver criterion : Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; 2x Upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; alkaline phosphatase bilirubin &lt; =1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . Consent : Capable give write informed consent , include compliance requirement restriction list consent form . A history lifethreatening asthma . Other significant pulmonary disease : pneumonia , pneumothorax , atelectasis , pulmonary fibrotic disease , bronchopulmonary dysplasia , chronic bronchitis , emphysema , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , respiratory abnormality asthma . Respiratory Infection : Culturedocumented suspect bacterial viral infection upper low respiratory tract , sinus middle ear resolve within 4 week screen ; lead change asthma management OR opinion Investigator , expect affect subject 's asthma status OR subject 's ability participate study . Asthma Exacerbation : Any asthma exacerbation require oral corticosteroid within 12 week screen result overnight hospitalization require additional treatment asthma within 6 month prior screen . Concomitant Medications : Use medication , ICS prohibit study period 24 hour prior dose 72 hour dose ; Long act beta agonist ( LABA ) , leukotriene receptor antagonist ( LTRA ) long act muscarinic anatagonist ( LAMA ) prohibit 12 week prior screen ; High dose ICS prohibit 8 week prior screen ; Oral steroid prohibit 12 week prior screen ; Potent CYPP3A4 inhibitor prohibit within 4 week prior dose . The following medication may use study first dose end period 2 inclusive : Anticonvulsants , Polycyclic antidepressant , Î²adrenergic block agent , Phenothiazines Monoamine oxidase ( MAO ) inhibitor . Other concurrent Diseases/Abnormalities : A subject clinically significant , uncontrolled condition disease state , opinion investigator , would put safety subject risk study participation would confound interpretation study result condition/disease exacerbated study . Oropharyngeal examination : A subject eligible he/she clinical visual evidence oral candidiasis screening .
