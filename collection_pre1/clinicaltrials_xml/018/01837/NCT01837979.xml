	<brief_summary>There 26,600 Down Syndrome newborn every year China . The economic burden disease 65,000 USD lifetime every patient . The common prenatal screen diagnosis procedure fetal chromosomal abnormality China maternal serum prenatal screen second trimester follow amniocentesis . The detection rate MSS 70 % -75 % 5 % false positive rate . There 13.9 % pregnant woman receive prenatal screen test China . It urgent build train system convenient , efficient , cost-effective procedure suitable rural China . The use dry blood spot ( DBS ) technology conjunction second trimester prenatal screen protocol prove efficient serum screen previous study . Noninvasive prenatal test us cell free fetal DNA ( cff DNA ) plasma pregnant woman offer tremendous potential fetal chromosomal abnormality . A positive test follow invasive prenatal diagnosis confirm test result . Cff DNA good supplement DBS technology rural China . A combination two method increase screen rate accuracy without increase demand amniocentesis cytogenetic test . This procedure adequate training system suitable rural China . Our study build training system DBS cffDNA prenatal screen procedure Pinggu , Beijing . Two thousand pregnant woman receive prenatal screening . DBS sample collect second trimester , Cff DNA offer confirm positive screen test result , lastly amniocentesis offer confirmation test result . All pregnancy neonatal outcomes follow . We estimate efficiency cost-effectiveness DBS follow cff DNA screening procedure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Goals To build training system DBS cffDNA prenatal screen procedure suitable rural China . Objectives Develop standardize prenatal screening test training program . Evaluate efficiency cost-effectiveness DBS cffDNA prenatal screening procedure rural China . Specific activity - Train medical staff : Select two hospital Pinggu Village . Train obstetrician family doctor , nurse county prenatal screen test well DBS cff DNA technology . Build series standardize training profile doctor nurse . Evaluate knowledge train staff compare prenatal screening rate well key health outcome variable pre post training . - collect DBS sample 2nd trimestaer : Two thousand pregnant woman receive prenatal screening . DBS sample together serum screening sample collect second trimester . - Cff DNA DBS high risk pregnant woman : Cff DNA offer confirm positive screen test result . - amniocentesis Cff DNA high risk pregnant woman : Amniocentesis offer confirmation test result . - Follpw-up neonatal outcome : All pregnancy neonatal outcomes follow . - Statistical analysis : We estimate efficiency cost-effectiveness DBS follow cff DNA screening procedure . We give recommendation government potential expansion new screen diagnosis procedure use countryside . Analytic method Build database visual Foxpro 5.0 . Use SAS9.2 software statistical analysis . Expected result product Develop standardize prenatal screening test training program doctor nurse rural China . Estimate training outcome . Estimate detection rate DBS compare maternal serum screen test . Estimate sensitivity specificity cffDNA test . Estimate efficiency cost-effectiveness DBS cff DNA screening procedure . Make sure DBS cffDNA suitable rural China successfully decrease birth defect . Timetable - Year 1 Select hospital form contract local staff . Develop train program finish training . Evaluate training outcome . Start collect DBS sample follow cffDNA . Enroll pregnant woman second trim sign consent form . - Year 2 Follow-up pregnancy neonatal outcome . Finish statistical analysis paper writing .</detailed_description>
