	<brief_summary>Sigmoid diverticular disease pathologie frequent patient 60 year old . A person diverticulosis may symptoms . When diverticulum rupture infection set around diverticulum condition call diverticulitis . An individual suffering diverticulitis may abdominal pain , abdominal tenderness , fever . Bleeding originate diverticulum , call diverticular bleeding . Frequent hospitalisation result evolution purulent peritonitis originate diverticulitis treat mini-invasive surgery result . Radiological percutaneous drainage wash abdominal cavity laparoscopic generalize purulent peritonitis diverticular origin identify therapeutic option HAS ( French health authority ) , follow second stage resection-anastomosis elective surgery . It observe patient drainage wash perform ( without resection ) , morbidity ( 10 % ) mortality ( 1.5 % ) rate much low usual rate ( resection ) respectively 20-40 % 10-30 % . Furthermore reduces risk postoperatory complication . Some study show attitude non-distance resection acute episode associate recurrence rate diverticulitis le 5 % recurrence without gravity . In addition , morbidity associate intervention sigmoid resection around 30 % . The question arise daily practice , propose systematic resection sigmoid diverticulitis acute episode severe purulent peritonitis abscess type support initially minimally invasive . The primary objective study determine , clinical improvement link conservative treatment perforate diverticulitis Hinchey peritonitis stage II III , conservative approach reduces morbidity compare cold sigmoid resection attitude currently recommend . The secondary objective study determine conservative treatment reduces mortality , length hospital stay compare cumulative sigmoid diverticular disease improve quality life .</brief_summary>
