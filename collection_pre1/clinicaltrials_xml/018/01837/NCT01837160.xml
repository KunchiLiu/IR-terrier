	<detailed_description>Integrins Integrins group molecules responsible intercellular adhesion signal . They comprise superfamily heterodimeric receptor compose 18 different α β subunit . In combination , generate 24 different receptor subtypes range physiological pathophysiological function . The αvβ3 receptor integrin find low level mature endothelial cell markedly regulate endothelial cell actively grow blood vessel . It previously know vitronectin receptor although subsequently find bind many ligand include fibrinogen , fibronectin , laminin , thrombospondin , von Willebrand factor , certain collagen subtypes . These feature also see αvβ5 integrin receptor , receptor recognise arginine-glycine-aspartate ( RGD ) motif present ligand . 1.1.2 Role αvβ3 αvβ5 Integrins Cardiovascular Disease The expression αvβ3 αvβ5 receptor regulate number diseased state particularly well characterise angiogenesis associate tumour growth metastasis . However , many potential role integrin pathway cardiovascular disease include myocardial infarction , atherosclerosis , restenosis , aortic stenosis aneurysm disease relatively unexplored . 1.1.2.1 Aortic Stenosis Aortic stenosis characterize extensive valvular thicken due accumulation fibrous tissue remodel extracellular matrix . In three layer valve , abundant fibroblast-like cell find commonly referred valvular interstitial cell . A sub-population cell become activated inflammatory activity within valve differentiate myofibroblasts . Whilst fibroblasts control synthesis collagen normal valve , myofibroblasts responsible accelerated fibrosis observe within stenotic valve . In addition , matrix metalloproteinases secrete myofibroblasts inflammatory cell , important complex role restructuring valve leaflet matrix . As already indicate , activation differentiation fibroblasts myofibroblasts dependent αvβ3 αvβ5 receptor expression . In addition , mirror situation carotid atherosclerosis , patient severe aortic stenosis high incidence ( 78 % ) intraleaflet haemorrhage associate angiogenesis rapid disease progression . Histopathological study confirm fibrosis integral part leave ventricular hypertrophic process aortic stenosis . Myofibroblasts infiltrate myocardium secrete extracellular matrix protein include collagen type I III . Areas fibrosis observe co-localize area myocyte apoptosis suggest fibrosis occur form scar myocyte death injury . As fibrosis valve , renin-angiotensin system , transform growth factor-beta imbalance matrix metalloproteinase tissue inhibitor activity implicate process . A mid-wall pattern fibrosis observe myocardium 38 % patient moderate severe aortic stenosis associate advanced hypertrophic response . Importantly , also 8-fold increase mortality associate mid-wall fibrosis . 1.1.2.2 Atherosclerosis Restenosis The development atherosclerosis due complex interplay oxidise lipid , inflammatory cell infiltration , smooth muscle cell migration arterial wall . Once establish , atherosclerotic plaque may progress rupture lead clinical presentation acute myocardial infarction stroke . Features associate plaque rupture include thin fibrous cap , lipid-rich pool intraplaque haemorrhage . Indeed , plaque rupture particularly associate plaque neovascularisation vascular-endothelial growth factor expression suggest instability may induce angiogenesis . Thus , regulation αvβ3 αvβ5 receptor may represent novel marker , potential therapeutic target , plaque vulnerability . 1.1.3 Fluciclatide Fluciclatide RGD-containing cyclic peptide recently develop 18F-radiotracer detect tumour angiogenesis positron emission tomography . It highly selective αvβ3 αvβ5 receptor affinity ( EC50 ) 11.1 0.1 nM respectively minimal cross reactivity αIIbβ3 receptor ( EC50 281 nM ) . Pre-clinical tumour work demonstrate 18F-fluciclatide take glioblastoma suppress anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor , sunitinib , confirm specificity fluciclatide area angiogenesis . It assess phase I clinical trial find safe well tolerate . 1.1.4 Aims To date , many preclinical study examine application radiotracers target αvβ3 αvβ5 integrin receptor . The clinical application tracer largely limited oncology method assess angiogenesis within tumour . Here wish explore role αvβ3 αvβ5 receptor radiotracer , 18F-fluciclatide , assess angiogenesis fibrosis patient aortic stenosis measure valvular myocardial fibrosis . This patient group co-existent aortic atheroma provide u opportunistic assessment tracer uptake atherosclerosis . We feel important ass range cardiovascular condition determine whether αvβ3 αvβ5 integrin receptor expression particular certain disease process . If successful , preliminary data permit detailed exploration specific disease area novel therapeutic intervention . At present , fluciclatide license approved clinical use use Investigational Agent explore pathophysiology aortic stenosis . 1.2 ORIGINAL HYPOTHESES We hypothesise 18F-fluciclatide identify expression αvβ3 αvβ5 integrin receptor vivo man two major cardiovascular disease area : aortic atherosclerosis aortic stenosis . Specifically , hypothesise 18F-fluciclatide : 1 . Be take aortic atherosclerotic plaque . 2 . Show demonstrable uptake aortic valve myocardium patient aortic stenosis correlate degree active angiogenesis fibrosis . 6.1 ANGIOGENESIS AND FIBROSIS IN AORTIC STENOSIS Aortic stenosis associate substantial leave ventricular hypertrophy consequent myocardial fibrosis latter predict prognosis . Left ventricular hypertrophy associate fibrosis also major risk factor adverse cardiovascular event number condition include essential hypertension . Cardiac magnetic resonance image gold-standard method assess presence myocardial fibrosis necessarily indicate go activity fibrotic process . In study , assess uptake 18F-fluciclatide patient aortic stenosis model pressure overload leave ventricular hypertrophy . We also seize opportunity determine whether uptake 18F-fluciclatide aortic valve give show area fibrosis angiogenesis . All study patient healthy volunteer undergo blood sampling , echocardiogram , positron emission compute tomography scan 18F-fluciclatide well cardiac magnetic resonance image assessment gadolinium late enhancement . Following injection 18F-fluciclatide , patient monitor use standard clinical approach , include observation haemodynamic parameter , continue throughout study visit departure . In patient undergoing aortic valve replacement surgery , aortic valve tissue retain 3-mm tru-cut biopsy leave ventricular myocardium obtain compare finding scan . Healthy volunteer patient undergo repeat assessment . After period one two year initial scan , patient Aortic Stenosis return repeat blood sampling , cardiac magnetic resonance image assessment late gadolinium enhancement echocardiogram . Those patient undergone aortic valve replacement undergo repeat positron emission compute tomography scan 18F-fluciclatide six month operation , prior second cardiac MRI scan . Blood sample assess use standard clinical biochemical haematological profile full blood count urea electrolyte . In addition , marker cardiac ischaemia , fibrosis angiogenesis assess . Additional serum , plasma DNA store -80 degree Celsius future potential analysis . 6.1.2 Study Interpretation We anticipate myocardial uptake 18F-fluciclatide increased patient aortic stenosis leave ventricular hypertrophy . We expect degree myocardial uptake correlate cardiac magnetic resonance image assessment fibrosis well histological measure fibrosis αvβ3 αvβ5 integrin receptor expression . We expect degree myocardial uptake predict cardiac magnetic resonance image assessment fibrosis follow period one two year . In exploratory analysis , also take opportunity assess extent 18F-fluciclatide uptake within aortic valve , successful , correlate histological measure angiogenesis fibrosis . 6.2 ANGIOGENESIS IN AORTIC ATHEROSCLEROSIS Patients aortic stenosis high prevalence concomitant aortic atherosclerosis . In Dr Dweck 's Fellowship , able exploit association undertake secondary analysis 18F-sodium fluoride uptake aortic coronary atherosclerosis . This generate highly innovative finding inform understanding atherosclerosis role calcification . 6.2.1 Study Schedule We use datasets obtain patient explore uptake 18F-fluciclatide within thoracic aorta . Atherosclerosis identify use compute tomography magnetic resonance image obtain thorax time study scan . No additional image acquisition require . This provide pilot data inform subsequent dedicate study focus acutely inflame atherosclerotic plaque , patient recent transient ischaemic attack stroke attributable carotid disease .</detailed_description>
