	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare CORTEX ( Cognitive Regulation Training Exercise ) , multi-faceted , general exercise-specific cognitive training program plus 4-month exercise program , attention-control condition involve health wellness informational lecture plus video . The proposed exercise program involve aerobic resistive exercise . The investigator hypothesize pre-intervention cognitive training enhance self-regulation self-efficacy turn , increase exercise adherence . The investigator also expect positive improvement cognitive psychosocial function among participant CORTEX condition compare Control condition immediately follow cognitive booster training , across time .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Aim 1 : To determine efficacy pre-intervention cognitive training improve exercise adherence engagement . We hypothesize class participation rate , physical activity count , self-reported exercise participation level higher 4 month participant CORTEX condition relative Control condition . We also predict pre-intervention training demonstrate high feasibility/acceptability , indicate thorough process evaluation . Primary Aim 2 : To determine integrated general exercise-specific cognitive training improve facet executive function exercise-related efficacy judgment . We hypothesize participant CORTEX condition show faster reaction time great accuracy train untrained-domain-relevant task , include dual task performance , reason , thought-stopping post-booster test 4-month follow-up . Furthermore , hypothesize CORTEX participant show significantly high level exercise efficacy judgment , exhibit great automaticity ( fast reaction time ) make judgment , post-booster testing , 1 month 4-month follow-up . Secondary Aim 1 : We use longitudinal mediation analysis examine mechanism change bring cognitive training effect exercise adherence engagement . We hypothesize change efficacy use self-regulatory strategy mediate cognitive training effect exercise adherence 4-months .</detailed_description>
