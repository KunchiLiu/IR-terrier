	<brief_title>Glycemic Control Using Insulin Levemir Versus Insulin NPH Diabetes Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The experimental method randomize control trial perform Roosevelt Hospital Diabetes Pregnancy Program ( DIPP ) . Perinatologists manage patient DIPP determine patient need treatment medical therapy . Patients undergo care DIPP may require medical intervention follow clinical scenario : failure diet alone control glycemic index grossly abnormal glucose tolerance screen test result suggest disease severity diet alone would sufficient . After verbally counsel patient , recruit study investigator . An extensive explanation objective study present patient , well write copy protocol consent . After informed consent give , patient randomize management either insulin NPH detemir together rapid act insulin aspart ( Novolog ) meal , necessary . The primary outcome level glycemic control define overall mean blood glucose pregnancy . This well establish measure overall glycemic control use numerous publication obstetric literature diabetes pregnancy . Participants follow deliver , expect range 6-16 week depend patient enrol study . The mean glucose determine sum average glucose visit divide number visit ) .</detailed_description>
