	<brief_title>Reversal Neuromuscular Blockade Thoracic Surgical Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergo thoracic surgical procedure receive general anesthetic operating room . As part general anesthetic , patient administer neuromuscular blocking agent ( NMBA muscle relaxant ) . NMBAs use facilitate placement endotracheal tube ( breathe tube ) , provide muscle relaxation surgery , prevent patient movement . Most thoracic surgeon request deep level muscle relaxation operative procedure . In particular , deep level neuromuscular blockade require prevent movement diaphragm ( diaphragmatic contraction interfere surgical procedure ) . Muscle contraction occur neurotransmitter acetylcholine bind postjunctional nicotinic acetylcholine receptor ( nAChR ) . Non-depolarizing NMBAs inhibit neuromuscular transmission primarily competitively antagonize block effect acetylcholine postjunctional nAChR . When high enough concentration NMBAs present , bind nAChR occurs , thus prevent acetylcholine activate receptor . Binding NMBAs nAChR occurs competitive fashion . If high concentration acetylcholine present neuromuscular junction , acetylcholine attach postsynaptic receptor facilitate neuromuscular transmission muscle contraction . Conversely , high concentration nondepolarizing NMBAs present neuromuscular junction , bind nAChR preferentially occur , prevent muscle depolarization occur . The effect NMBAs must reverse end surgery . One mechanism antagonize effect NMBAs increase concentration acetylcholine neuromuscular junction . This accomplish use anticholinesterase drug inhibits enzyme break acetylcholine neuromuscular junction ( acetylcholinesterase ) . The anticholinesterase drug commonly use reverse neuromuscular blockade neostigmine . At NorthShore University HealthSystem , patient receive NMBA reverse neostigmine conclusion surgical procedure . There two important limitation anticholinesterase reversal agent , relate mechanism action describe . First , onset action slow . In presence mild degree muscle relaxation ( four response train-of-four ( TOF ) nerve stimulation peripheral nerve stimulator , also know TOF count 4 ) , adequate reversal NMBAs take approximately 10-15 minute . However , presence deeper neuromuscular block ( one response TOF nerve stimulation , TOF count 1 ) , complete reversal take average 30-60 minute . Second , profound neuromuscular blockade antagonize . If evidence neuromuscular recovery present end surgery ( response peripheral nerve stimulation TOF count 0 ) , reversal agent ineffective . In situation , concentration NMBA neuromuscular junction high ( NMBA preferentially bind nAChR acetylcholine , inhibition acetylcholinesterase raise level acetylcholine enough competitively antagonize NMBA ) . Despite routine reversal muscle relaxant operate room , patient often arrive post anesthesia care unit ( PACU ) evidence residual muscle weakness ( term residual neuromuscular blockade ) . Traditionally , residual neuromuscular blockade measure defined use quantitative neuromuscular monitoring device . These device use electrical energy stimulate ulnar nerve ; four stimulus provide , response nerve stimulation thumb measure . The ratio fourth contraction compare first contraction generate TOF ratio ( 0-1.0 0-100 % ) . Recent data suggest TOF ratio must recover &gt; 0.9 exclude clinically significant residual neuromuscular blockade . A number clinical study demonstrate approximately 40 % patient give NMBAs operate room objective evidence muscle weakness ( TOF ratio &lt; 0.9 ) admission PACU . It likely incidence residual neuromuscular blockade high thoracic surgical patient , since deep level neuromuscular blockade require . However , previous study specifically investigated patient population . The presence residual muscle weakness end surgery , follow tracheal extubation ( removal breathe tube ) , associate number adverse postoperative event . Patients TOF ratio &lt; 0.9 admission PACU high risk potentially life threaten airway event , include hypoxemia ( low oxygen saturation ) , airway obstruction , postoperative pulmonary complication . In addition , patient TOF ratio &lt; 0.9 often experience unpleasant symptom muscle weakness , blurry vision , difficultly speak swallow , general weakness . Patient-perceived quality recovery anesthesia surgery also significantly low patient admit PACU TOF ratio &lt; 0.9 . Studies also demonstrate patient TOF ratio &lt; 0.9 take significantly longer reach discharge criterion PACU , achieve actual PACU discharge . Improved management neuromuscular blockade operate beneficially impact incidence residual neuromuscular blockade , well complication associate incomplete neuromuscular recovery . For example , use quantitative neuromuscular monitoring , allow rational titration NMBAs intraoperatively , demonstrate reduce risk admission PACU TOF ratio &lt; 0.9 . Furthermore , risk hypoxemic event , airway obstruction , unpleasant symptom muscle weakness diminish quantitative monitoring . Another potential method reduce risk residual neuromuscular blockade , complication associate residual blockade , use new class NMBA reversal agent . Sugammadex recently develop antagonist steroidal NMBAs act via different mechanism anticholinesterase agent . Sugammadex ( Org 25969 ) modify Î³-cyclodextrin first selective relaxant bind agent base encapsulate principle inactivation neuromuscular blocking agent . Sugammadex cylindric compound lipophilic cavity hydrophilic exterior . This structure allow drug take lipophilic molecule core ; sugammadex rapidly encapsulate steroidal NMBAs like rocuronium present circulation . Rapid encapsulation rocuronium intravascular compartment result gradient draws rocuronium away neuromuscular junction ( also immediately encapsulate ) . This principle reversal rocuronium- vecuronium-induced neuromuscular block first introduce clinical practice 2008 available pediatric adult anesthesia majority country world-wide . The complex formation sugammadex rocuronium vecuronium occur level neuromuscular block ( profound - shallow ) display rapidly-acting pharmacological profile oppose anticholinesterases reversal effect . When appropriate dosing sugammadex use , level neuromuscular blockade reverse ( TOF ratio &gt; 0.9 ) within 2-4 minute . Consequently , sugammadex may potential markedly reduce postoperative residual neuromuscular block PACU . In addition , sugammadex may also reduce incidence adverse event related incomplete neuromuscular recovery . Sugammadex extensively investigate large number clinical trial demonstrate significantly effective rapid reversing level neuromuscular block , compare neostigmine . At present time , safety profile sugammadex appear similar neostigmine , clinical trial world-wide usage ( 4 million us , per manufacturer report ) . Sugammadex may offer several potential advantage patient undergo thoracic surgery . Deep level neuromuscular blockade maintain end procedure , may facilitate performance surgery . Sugammadex effective reverse deep level blockade ( even TOF count 0 `` twitch '' ) , whereas neostigmine antagonize deep blockade . In addition , time operate room may shorten . It uncommon tracheal extubation delay patient population due slow onset effect neostigmine moderate level neuromuscular block present time reversal ( TOF count 1-3 ) . Furthermore , patient recovery may enhance PACU incidence residual block reduce sugammadex . The aim prospective observational investigation examine effect sugammadex ( versus neostigmine ) recovery follow thoracic surgery . In addition , data 120 patient reversed neostigmine collect , data analyze compare patient residual block ( train-of four &lt; 0.9 ) without residual block ( TOF &lt; /= 0.9 ) The primary outcome variable incidence residual block ( measure quantitative neuromuscular monitoring ) time PACU admission . Secondary outcome measure include incidence residual block tracheal extubation , time surgical closure tracheal extubation , frequency adverse respiratory event PACU , presence absence symptom sign postoperative muscle weakness , length stay operate room PACU .</detailed_description>
