	<brief_title>Quantitative Computed Tomodensitometry Patients With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients cystic fibrosis deficit bone mineralization . This particularly well describe adult . However , pediatric population result heterogeneous . The evaluation hinder difficulty standardization DXA interpretation . This measurement depend mass size bone well mass soft tissue cover bone area . These two characteristic , intrinsic measurement , pose significant problem interpretation child change bone density may reflect change bone mineral content change related growth , example , increase bone size volume soft tissue cover bone interest . Quantitative compute tomography ( QCT ) provide direct measure bone mineralization densitometry volume . It quantify bone mineral content relation volume bone , reference external phantom . This method therefore overcome size size . This technique consider without additional radiation exposure patient lung CT usual lumbar vertebra include measurement window pulmonary hyperinflation . This exam would ideal patient Cystic fibrosis . All patient two evaluation routine management . This study compare study bone mineralization evaluate ( QCT ) compare reference technique ( DXA ) patient affect cystic fibrosis patient .</detailed_description>
