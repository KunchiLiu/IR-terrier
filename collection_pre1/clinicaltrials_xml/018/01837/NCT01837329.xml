	<brief_summary>The main objective study determine recommend phase II dose safety tetrathiomolybdate ( TM ) combination carboplatin pemetrexed chemo-naive metastatic recurrent non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study Tetrathiomolybdate Combination With Carboplatin/Pemetrexed Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Platinum resistance major limitation treatment advance non-small cell lung cancer . Previous study suggest reduce tumor platinum level may significantly contribute platinum resistance thus poor outcome follow platinum-based chemotherapy lung cancer . Tetrathiomolybdate ( TM ) fast-acting copper chelator significant investigation anti-cancer strategy due anti-angiogenic property . Furthermore , recent preclinical evidence suggest combine TM platinum drug result high intratumoral platinum concentration great tumor response . The oncologist University Rochester study addition TM commonly use 1st line platinum-based doublet , carboplatin/pemetrexed , patient non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>&gt; 18 year old Performance status 01 Newly diagnose stage IV nonsquamous nonsmall cell lung cancer recurrent disease prior surgery and/or irradiation Patients must receive prior chemotherapy stage non small cell lung cancer Brain metastases allow provide controlled ≥ 2 week completion treatment remain asymptomatic corticosteroid least 1 day Patient primary care taker must inform understand investigational nature study must sign give write approve informed consent accordance institutional guideline . If patient childbearing potential , must agree practice effective method birth control prior study entry , duration study participation , 30 day last study dose . Patient adequate organ function : serum bilirubin ≤ 2.0 mg/dL ; alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) ≤ 3 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , ALT ≤ 5 x ULN patient hepatic metastasis ; serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL calculate creatinine clearance least 60 mL/min . Patient adequate bone marrow reserve : absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500 , platelet count ≥ 100,000 , hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 . Patient receive concurrent chemotherapy Patients receive platinumbased chemotherapy purpose Patients gastric bypass surgery Patients take copper supplementation medical reason Medical and/or psychiatric problem sufficient severity limit full compliance study expose patient undue risk Patients active uncontrolled infection Patients concomitant active malignancy require treatment cytotoxic chemotherapy radiation therapy ( ongoing hormonal therapy treatment malignancy would exclude patient trial ) Known anaphylactic severe hypersensitivity study drug analog . Patient fail recover prior surgery within 4 week study entry . Patient clinical evidence copper deficiency ( i.e . ceruloplasmin level less 15 mg/dL free serum copper level less 2.2 g/dL ) . Patients tumor epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutation anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase ( ALK ) positive . If biopsy specimen insufficient inadequate EGFR and/or ALK testing , subject eligible study . Patients pregnant lactating .</criteria>
