	<detailed_description>OPTIMIZE - OS ( Optimization Pre-surgical Testing Intensive Multifactorial Intervention MinimiZe Cardiovascular Events - Orthopedic Surgery ) trial determine best management strategy patient undergo orthopedic surgery . OPTIMIZE prospective randomize trial enroll patient pre-surgical test orthopedic surgery . This trial investigate different strategy aim lower cardiovascular event follow orthopedic surgery . The study compare intensive multifactorial intervention comprise behavioral modification polypharmacologic therapy aim several modifiable risk factor versus usual care . The trial hypothesis personalize optimization approach superior usual care reduce composite death , myocardial infarction , stroke , transient ischemic attack , myocardial necrosis , venous thromboembolism thrombosis require reoperation 30-days . Secondary endpoint include length stay , major bleeding , individual endpoint primary endpoint , quality life .</detailed_description>
