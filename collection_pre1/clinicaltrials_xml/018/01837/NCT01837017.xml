	<detailed_description>Over half person multiple sclerosis ( MS ) report fall 6-month period half fall require medical attention injury . To make matter bad , fall result activity curtailment , physiological deconditioning , institutionalization . Importantly , balance dysfunction , muscle weakness , spasticity modifiable risk factor fall among community-dwelling older adult likely person MS . Indeed , evidence physiological risk factor minimize exercise training person MS might translate decrease fall risk document community-dwelling older adult . To end , appropriately design exercise train program target specific , modifiable risk factor might effective decrease fall risk person MS . The investigation examine effectiveness home-based exercise program design reduce fall risk target specific fall risk factor include balance dysfunction two latent cause , muscle weakness spasticity person multiple sclerosis . It predict person receive home-based exercise program reduction fall risk . Participants undergo multidimensional assessment walking , balance , muscle strength , spasticity fall risk prior immediately follow 12 week intervention . Following baseline assessment participant randomize intervention control group . The intervention group receive exercise instruction 4 time 2 month . The home-based exercise protocol focus improve balance , walking , low limb core muscle strength , spasticity , potential determinant fall .</detailed_description>
