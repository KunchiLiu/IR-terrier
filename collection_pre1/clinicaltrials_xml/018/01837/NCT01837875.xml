	<brief_summary>The goal propose project enhance Principal Investigator 's research ability conduct behavioral intervention people lupus . This include intervention design , implementation , data collection data analysis . The Intervention Improve Quality life African-AmericaN lupus patient ( IQAN ) Project design examine whether uniquely tailor intervention program improve quality life , decrease indicator depression , reduce perceived biological indicator stress African American lupus patient . This study build three decade work conducted field arthritis self-management differs intervention mode , disease ( lupus ) , study population ( African-Americans ) unstudied understudied . The IQAN Project use Reach , Effectiveness , Adoption , Implementation , Maintenance ( RE-AIM ) model theoretical framework . This program three specific aim . The first aim seek design three arm randomize , wait list control trial employ patient-centered ' a-la-carte ' approach offer subject variety mode interaction , allow choose many wish . The second aim ass intervention , use RE-AIM model framework . The third aim , achieve first aim , use previously collect data characterize patient-centric barrier care African-American lupus patient , order identify trend patient need desire , well correlate non-response non-compliance use development refinement intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The intervention coordinate Intervention Coordinator , assistance local/MUSC Study Coordinators . A unique ' a-la-carte ' self-management program offer 50 African-American lupus patient participate ongoing SLE Clinic Database Project MUSC . The Intervention Coordinator work participant intervention arm create individualize intervention plan ( IIP ) . Each IIP include 1-4 option , include mail-delivered arthritis kit , addition access listserv , participation support group , enrollment local self-management program ( ) . Due nature IIP , propose intervention inherently vary participant . A 'set menu ' control group 50 lupus patient offer standardized chronic disease self-management program , control group 50 lupus patient receive usual care ( UC ) , void intervention component . Validated measure stress , depression , quality life collect patient condition intervention activity . To ensure intervention integrity , discrete component follow write protocol peer leader complete standardize checklist session/encounter .</detailed_description>
