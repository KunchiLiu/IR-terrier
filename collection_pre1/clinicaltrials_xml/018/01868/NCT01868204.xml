	<detailed_description>Obesity declare number one illness 21st Century industrialized country , reach epidemic proportion . Adoption , twin family study report obesity strong heritable component particular , suggest BMI adult due genetic influence rather share family environment . Binge eat obese patient escribed . Therefore , propose binge eat disorder ( BED ) may contribute obesity individual . Subjects BED frequently obese . Conversely , BED often observe obese population , especially severely obese . Therefore , finding suggest BED major public health problem contributor obesity epidemic . Evidence twin study suggest significant contribution genetic factor binge eating . Interestingly , report relative patient BED display high prevalence obesity , particularly severe obesity relatives probands without BED . Adoption twin study consistently show , regardless population study , genetic factor play important role determine risk develop binge eating . Pharmacological study report topiramate play important role treatment binge eat disorder . It observe improvement co-occurring binge eat disorder patient receive topiramate treatment mood disorder . In addition , topiramate associate anorexia weight loss clinical trial epilepsy patient . Also , topiramate demonstrate efficacy pilot control study binge eat disorder ( BED ) associate obesity . A paper review show topiramate weigtht loss report 21 32 study analyze . Recently , approve 4/6/2012 use topiramate combination phentermine ( QNEXA ) Meeting Endocrinologic Metabolic Drugs Advisory Committee Food Drug Administration , adjunct diet exercise weight management patient body mass index ( BMI ) equal great 30 kilogram ( kg ) per square meter BMI equal great 27 kg per square meter accompany weight-related co-morbidities . Finally , animal study show stimulation lateral hypothalamus glutamate glutamate agonist , include kainite/AMPA agonist , cause intense , rapid , dose-dependent increase food intake . Topiramate weight loss report 21 32 study analyse reach 5 % reduction baseline weight prior treatment 5 study . Among study analyze , frequent find grater weight loss associate high BMI baseline . Also , diabetic patient related glycemic control normalization blood pressure hypertensive subject . Topiramate generally well tolerate serious adverse event rare . Also , use topiramate report effective weight reduction improvement glycemic control obese subject type 2 diabetes treat metformin monotherapy . Topiramate , approve use epilepsy migraine prophylaxis , multiple site action might contribute neurostabilizing effect . The mechanism action topiramate BED unknown . It may act appetite suppressant satiety enhancer somehow influence reward system act appetite , thereby reduce binge eating . Topiramate show affect serotoninergic neurotransmission . Indeed , show attenuate nicotine-induced increase mesolimbic extracellular dopamine norepinephrine , serotonin , release . In addition , topiramate antagonizes glutamate receptor . Since glutamate glutamate agonist rapidly elicit intense eating injected lateral hypothalamus rat , topiramate might reduce binge eat glutamate antagonism . However , mechanism action topiramate unknown . Therefore , important pharmacogenetic neurofunctional brain study could help elucidate role topiramate new treatment binge eat disorder associate obesity Mexican population . Genetic study important elucidate mechanism putative susceptibility variation candidate gene influence pharmacological improvement binge eat disorder obese patient treated topiramate . DNA variant cod regulatory region gene useful systematic genome scan , identify gene associate drug response , examine integrate system gene pathways important step route functional genomics . Initiatives focus identification gene variant would greatly facilitate postgenomic research link gene , brain , behavior , treatment response . Many drug target ( e.g. , receptor , transporter , enzyme ) contribute pharmacodynamics drug response key player regulation neurotransmitter system also directly indirectly modify development plasticity neural network involve drug effect . There considerable evidence variability epigenetic profile gene critical neurocircuit development function influence drug response . There number different kind natural genetic variation result functional protein difference affect drug responsiveness . The type variation prevalent genome , arguably , relevant common disease complex trait represent single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) . There many way genetic variability , difference sequence specific gene , lead variability drug responsiveness likely mechanism involve determine effect example anticonvulsant drug . Up , focus pharmacogenetic study `` polymorphic drug metabolism '' . This methodology examine variation sequence gene code drug-metabolizing enzyme . SNPs find underlie variability drug-metabolizing capacity variability often documented difference drug metabolite profile patient . It likely variation gene cod protein involve pharmacokinetic process , include drug absorption , distribution , excretion , also help determine individual difference responsiveness although mechanism well study regard genetic influence . Another way genetic variation play role drug response depend upon polymorphisms gene code protein involve drug target mediate drug action . These difference response apply therapeutic effect adverse effect efficacy toxicity may influence individual genetic variation . In future , pharmacogenetic discovery relate drug make individualization therapy even difficult sense genetic substrate mediates efficacy may well differ mediates toxicity . As , two different set gene genotype need examine order match patient appropriate treatment . Differences response apply therapeutic effect adverse effect efficacy toxicity may influence individual genetic variation . In addition , compound exist mechanisms action either differ standard drug yet fully characterize . These compound mechanisms lead eventually investigation specific , possibly novel , gene relation drug responsiveness . Because behavioral trait complex trait , response psychopharmacological drug , modify behaviour trait , likely profit integration . Moreover , behavioural pharmacogenetics make major contribution functional genomics . Connecting drug response relevant functional DNA variant difference brain region represent ultimate goal pharmacogenetic research play important role advance understand . Brain image provide valuable link understand potential importance clarify pathophysiological mechanism lie association genetic variability clinical response . Analysis additional population , Mexican population , also necessary achieve goal . The use brain imaging combine genetics aid understanding pathophysiological mechanism disease . Additionally , brain imaging ability bridge preclinical research human pharmacological study . This study propose collection sample result study form basis identify gene associate neurofunctional brain area involve food crave obese patient BED treat topiramate Mexican population . The pharmacogenetic analysis obese patient associate BED identify gene variant associate treatment efficacy topiramate Mexican population . Objective The main objective study analyze genetic variant neurofunctional brain area associate food crave obese patient binge eat disorder responder topiramate treatment . Study design : This naturalistic clinical study design analyze effect genetic variant neurofunctional brain area associate food crave patient obesity binge eat disorder responder topiramate .</detailed_description>
