	<brief_summary>Patients schedule undergo knee arthroscopy anterior cruciate ligament repair graft ipsilateral hamstring gracilis randomize one three group . All patient receive subsartorial saphenous nerve block . Along , Group 1 receive perihamstring local anesthetic infiltration ( Hamstring block ) , Group 2 receive blockade anterior division obturator nerve Group 3 ( control group ) receive sham injection hamstring anterior division obturator nerve . All patient receive co-analgesics home discharge . The study evaluate efficacy subsartorial saphenous nerve block alone combination either hamstring block obturator block regard postoperative analgesia especially donor site pain total analgesic consumption .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Performance arthroscopic knee repair day care basis necessitates adequate post-operative analgesia successful home discharge since post-operative pain know commonest cause unanticipated readmission day care patient . Early return activity also crucial ensure adequate surgical outcome . Anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) repair commonly perform arthroscopic approach ipsilateral hamstring-gracilis graft . This show superior patellar tendon graft regard pain functional outcome surgery . Postoperative pain graft donor site anterior knee pain form surgery lead decrease range motion poor rehabilitation . A variety regional anesthetic technique try out-patient knee surgery like spinal adjuvant ; intra peri-articular injection , single injection continuous block femoral sciatic nerve , oral pill cryoanalgesia . Opioid base analgesia without co-analgesics suit dynamic pain relief since Aα Aδ nerve fibre carry pain poorly inhibit opioids effectively inhibit local anesthetic . Multimodal analgesic regimen work well ambulatory surgery especially combine regional analgesic technique . Regional technique decrease opioid consumption hence opioid related side effect . Intra peri-articular injection short duration action compare nerve block apart concern chondrotoxicity intra-articular local anesthetic . Although femoral- sciatic nerve block provide adequate analgesia , weakness quadriceps hamstring prevent early rehabilitative effort also pose risk patient fall follow home discharge . Hence , novel regional technique analgesia like block infrapatellar branch saphenous nerve , graft site injection local anesthetic arthroscopic sleeve single injection adductor canal block try . Isolated sensory block surgical graft site without motor block Holy Grail search ambulatory patient . Saphenous nerve , terminal branch femoral nerve supply majority knee joint . The femoral nerve exit adductor canal give terminal branch saphenous nerve lie Sartorius muscle femoral artery sub-sartorial canal . Subsartorial canal block successfully utilized forefoot surgery knee arthroplasty evaluate ACL repair . Saphenous nerve successfully block subsartorial canal without risk leg weakness alone insufficient provide analgesia graft donor site usually gracilis tendon hamstring tendon . Depositions local anesthetic around harvested muscle blockade nerve supply attractive strategy decrease donor site pain explore purpose randomized fashion . The investigator hypothesize combination two technique decrease donor site pain along subsartorial saphenous nerve block provide adequate analgesia patient . The anterior branch obturator nerve need block since supply gracilis muscle . To decrease donor site pain , saphenous nerve block combine block anterior branch obturator nerve . Alternatively , saphenous nerve block combine deposition local anesthetic around graft donor muscle . The extent two technique benefit patient term overall analgesia graft site analgesia evaluate . With background , investigator want compare analgesic efficacy subsartorial saphenous nerve block either perihamstrings infiltration blockade anterior division obturator nerve patient undergo ACL reconstruction ipsilateral autograft gracilis hamstring muscle .</detailed_description>
