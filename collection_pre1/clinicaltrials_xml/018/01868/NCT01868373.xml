	<brief_summary>To confirm extend work Trede Rask-Madsen ( Lancet 1989 ; 1:1156-1160 ) administration define fecal microbiota lead rapid sustain resolution C. difficile associate chronic relapse diarrhea . The current rationale behind FMT CDI introduction microbe healthy donor allow restoration normal microbial community diseased host consequent suppression C. difficile colonization disease pathogenesis . The first modern use FMT report 1958 case series 4 patient pseudomembranous enterocolitis . The first case confirm CDI treat FMT report 1983 ; treatment curative . Until 1989 , retention enema common technique FMT . Alternative method deliver FMT include fecal infusion via duodenal tube ( 1991 ) , rectal tube ( 1994 ) , colonoscopy ( 1998 ) . FMT recurrent CDI use successfully whether administer nasogastric tube , rectal administration colonoscopy , rectal tube include self-administration home enema . FMT proven remarkably effective remarkably safe without significant problem ( see attach review meta-analyses ) . Increasing , interest emerge regard change intestinal microbiota associate CDI . In 2008 Chang et al . construct small ( &lt; 200 sequence per subject ) 16S rRNA gene library stool 4 patient first-time CDI 3 patient recurrent CDI . Based 16S rRNA gene classification , find fecal microbiomes patient initial episode CDI similar phylum level healthy subject ( i.e. , majority sequence belong dominant fecal phylum Bacteroidetes Firmicutes ) , major reduction loss Bacteroidetes observe patient recurrent CDI . The loss Bacteroidetes accompany expansion phylum , include Proteobacteria Verrucomicrobia , normally minor constituent fecal microbiota . Khoruts et al . ( 2010 ) compare microbiota patient recurrent CDI FMT use terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism clone-based 16S rRNA gene sequence . Before transplantation , patient 's microbiota deficient member Bacteroides instead compose atypical fecal genus Veillonella , Clostridium , Lactobacillus , Streptococcus , unclassified bacteria similar Erysipelothrix . Two week infusion donor fecal suspension , bacterial composition feces approach normal dominated Bacteroides sp . strain . In 1989 , Tvede Rask-Madsen use combination nine normal fecal organism treat 6 patient chronic relapse C. difficile diarrhea . These investigator cultivate 10 strain bacteria , include Enterococcus ( Streptococcus ) faecalis ( 1108-2 ) , Clostridium innocuum ( A27-24 ) , Clostridium ramosum ( A3I-3 ) , Bacteroides ovatus ( A40-4 ) , Bacteroides vulgatus ( A33-14 ) , Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron ( A33-12 ) , Escherichia coli ( 1109 ) , E. coli ( 1108-1 ) , Clostridium bifermentans ( A27-6 ) , Blautia producta ( Peptostreptococcus productus ) ( 1108-2 ) broth 48 h concentration approximately 10 9th power bacteria/mL . Two mL bacterial culture admix 180 mL saline pretreated anaerobic chamber 24 h ; bacterial suspension instill rectally . This procedure follow promptly decline C. difficile undetectable level culture loss detectable toxin stool . Normal bowel function restore within 24 hour , abdominal symptom disappear . Stool culture toxin assay C. difficile remain negative year follow-up . It especially important note feces none 6 patient contain Bacteroides sp .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Defined Fecal Microbiota Transplantation Clostridium Difficile Diarrhea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study initially enroll 12 subject . Based relatively large experience FMT report date , anticipate prompt sustain response determine cessation fever , leukocytosis diarrhea loss abdominal discomfort &gt; 8 ( 80 % ) subject . If response observe &gt; 3 first 6 patient treat , reevaluate composition FMT mixture and/or consider whether one inoculum give . If 80 % great success rate achieve , clinical follow-up study microbiome continue total 12 month . During time , would plan obtain new approval test method inoculum delivery ( e.g. , via NG tube oral administration buffer solution ) . In contrast use raw stool unknown variable composition , inoculum define grown anerobic condition define medium . Pre-administration oft therapy inoculum examine gram strain culture ensure contains orgamisms use . The chance contaminant think unlikely contamination unknown pathogen essentially impossible . As additional safety measure inoculum give gastrointestinal tract design food non-sterile material . We anticipate prompt sustain response , determine cessation fever , leukocytosis diarrhea loss abdominal discomfort &gt; 8 ( 80 % ) subject . If response observe &gt; 3 first 6 patient treat , reevaluate composition FMT mixture and/or consider whether one inoculum give . If 80 % success rate achieve , clinical follow-up study microbiome continue total 12 month . Inclusion Criteria : Only VA patient eligible study confirm diagnosis CDI treat 10-14 day recommend dos metronidazole vancomycin either failed respond , respond relapse within 4 week end treatment . The diagnosis regard confirm presence diarrhea ( &gt; 3 unformed stool 24-hour period 2 successive day ) abdominal discomfort . The presence fever , leukocytosis , serum albumin &lt; 3 gm/dL record necessary diagnosis . Patients include give informed consent sign appropriate consent form approve Baylor IRB . Procedure : Patients prove recurrent CDI MEDVAMC ask participate . The health record VA patient enter flag enrol reseach study . We presume strain describe Tvede Rask-Madsen clinical isolates record strain late publication available public strain repository ATCC , DSMZ , CCUG . In place specific strain , use follow fully sequence type strain , originally isolate human feces , purchase ATCC : Bacteroides ovatus ATCC 8483 , Bacteroides vulgatus ATCC 8482 , Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron ATCC 29148 . Primary culture grow accord GLP procedure ( SOP attach ) pre-reduced anaerobic blood agar ANABA ( Remel , Lenexa , KS ) , broth culture strain anaerobically cultivate 37°C 48 hour pre-reduced chop meat medium make house . Bacteria collect centrifugation 1,600 x g 10 minute resuspend 5 mL sterile pre-reduced 0.9 % saline , use Macfarlane standard estimate bacterial concentration target final concentration 10 power 8 9 cfu/mL . Aliquots ( 0.1 mL ) remove serial dilution plat anaerobic incubation 37°C pre-reduced ANABA plat determine actual bacterial concentration . Two mL three saline suspension combine 194 mL sterile pre-reduced 0.9 % saline form infusion cocktail . The 200 mL bacterial suspension administer small intestine use Olympus ultra-slim gastro-duodenoscope . The small bowel route choose avoid potentially deleterious effect gastric acid survival inoculum prevent reduce reflux volume administer stomach . Subjects follow 12 month . Transplant procedure : Patients pretreated 4 day oral vancomycin ( 125 mg q 6 hr ) reduce C. difficile load , final dose give 6 PM evening procedure ( approximately 14-16 hour FMT ) . On even FMT morning procedure , patient receive 20 mg omeprazole mouth . On morning procedure , `` super-slim '' 5.5 mm diameter gastroscope pass per mouth patient 's small intestine attempt place tip beyond ligament Treitz . Two hundred mL bacterial suspension instill small intestine via catheter introduce biopsy channel endoscope flush 25 mL sterile pre-reduced 0.9 % saline . After removal endoscope , recovery , patient allow resume normal diet physical activity . Subjects see daily hospital ( contact daily phone discharge ) 14 day . Subjects contact 30 day monthly 3 month , every 3 month one year . Symptoms record contact use standard questionnaire . Laboratory examination include CBC differential , basic metabolic panel albumin obtain 3 day , 10 day 30 plus minus 7 day . The result clinical outcome combine evaluation effect therapy fecal microbiome . Stools sample collect regularly 1 year proven relapse . Stools sample rectal swab otained daily initial study period discharge hospital 14 day stool sample 30 day 3 month interval one year . After discharge hospital sample send laboratory use cold pack Federal Express . This allow u examine detail effect therapy C. difficile well fate administer bacteria ( entire genome sequence publish ) . detail see attachment ) .</detailed_description>
