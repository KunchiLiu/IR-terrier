	<brief_summary>Our objective investigate predictive value panel biomarkers associate two biologically plausible pathway preterm birth : membrane breakdown cervical remodeling . The investigator obtain cervical length , cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin , panel novel cervicovaginal biomarkers associate cervical remodel prospective cohort symptomatic woman singleton pregnancy high risk preterm birth effort well risk stratify cohort .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Preterm Birth complex syndrome several different biologically plausible pathway propose , include mechanical uterine distension , abruption , inflammation , and/or activation fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-axis . However , despite know complexity syndrome different pathway involve , paucity clinical study investigate whether detection one pathways single patient might enhance identification great risk preterm birth . We propose investigate predictive value panel biomarkers associate two biological plausible pathway - membrane breakdown cervical remodel - must involve pathogenesis preterm birth . Specifically , propose measure cervical length collect cervicovaginal fetal fibronectin well panel novel cervicovaginal biomarkers reflect molecular pathway involve cervical remodel prospectively collect cohort symptomatic woman singleton fetus high risk preterm birth . Through study hope improve risk stratification high risk cohort .</detailed_description>
