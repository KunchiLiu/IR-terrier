	<detailed_description>Musculoskeletal impairment significant cause functional limitation disability woman . Women high risk osteoarthritis comparison men [ 1 ] functional limitation due arthritis also common woman . [ 2 , 3 ] In addition , woman disproportionately affect ( risk compare men ) knee osteoarthritis ( 1.8x ) , [ 4 ] great trochanteric pain syndrome ( 3.3x ) , [ 5 ] incident hip osteoarthritis [ 6 ] chronic joint pain ( 1.3x ) , [ 7 ] include foot pain [ 8 ] knee pain [ 9 ] hip pain [ 9-12 ] low back pain ( 1.2x ) . [ 7 , 13 ] Preventing even portion could avoid functional limitation disability , enhance quality life result considerable saving . [ 2 ] However , etiology increase risk musculoskeletal diseases impairment elucidate . [ 1 ] Acute Changes Foot Structure Are Reported Pregnancy The disproportionate risk musculoskeletal problem may , part , relate biochemical biomechanical change occur woman 's body pregnancy . For example , hallux valgus deformity , lateral deviation great toe often conjunction bunion deformity , occur woman nine time rate men . [ 14 ] Both link reduction arch height . [ 15 ] Body mass increase average 9-13 kg pregnancy . [ 16 ] There also seven ten-fold increase relaxin level pregnancy , [ 17-19 ] peptide hormone produce corpus luteum increase flexibility remodel collagen central peripheral joint pregnant woman . [ 17 , 18 , 20-26 ] Bearing increase weight joint increase laxity pregnancy could potentially lead permanent change foot . [ 19 , 26-28 ] Increases foot length , width , volume report pregnancy . [ 29 , 30 , 31 ] In addition anatomic change foot , also change gait pattern pregnancy . [ 32-35 ] Nyska find center pressure foot pregnancy shift posteriorly compensate increase anterior abdominal mass . [ 36 ] The combination ligamentous laxity arch , increase body mass pregnancy shift center pressure towards posterior part foot may potentially contribute stretch ligament support arch , leading loss arch height . More important foot change report pregnancy issue change persist follow completion pregnancy . In self-report study , find dose-response relationship number pregnancy frequency report permanent change foot size woman age 18-45 . [ 37 ] We conduct longitudinal study determine whether arch height loss occur persist postpartum . Sixty woman first trim pregnancy enrol arch height function measure baseline approximately 19 week postpartum . There significant decrease arch height arch rigidity index follow-up , concomitant increase foot length arch drop . This study reveal , pregnancy associate permanent loss arch height , also first pregnancy appear significant reduction arch rigidity ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) increase foot length ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) , arch drop ( p=0.0019 ) center pressure excursion gait ( p=0.0019 ) . These change foot could contribute increase risk subsequent musculoskeletal disorder . Arch Height Loss Leads Adverse Biomechanical Changes Other Joints Consideration effect foot structure force torques joint low limb spine well need energy generation absorption associate soft-tissue structure illustrate importance potential change . With step , series event occur elicits biomechanical effect compensation throughout low limb kinetic chain , movement joint influence movement joint chain . [ 38 ] Disruption complex interaction skeletal , musculotendinous ligamentous structure loss arch height may predispose painful musculoskeletal condition . [ 39-43 ] As initial link body load stance movement , foot `` rubber hit road . '' The arch dynamically deform distribute force , thereby absorb rapid impulse loading . Changes foot biomechanics occur change foot structure alter normal control force propagate foot proximal low limb joint spine , [ 44 ] contribute pain foot , knee , hip , [ 41-43 ] low back . Possibly common cause change biomechanics loss arch height . Excessive pronation strain support structure foot tendon cross ankle , lead impaired balance , [ 45 ] strain passive stabilizer Achilles tendon , iliotibial band , [ 46 ] anterior cruciate ligament , [ 47 ] contribute permanent impairment soft tissue structure low limb . [ 47 , 48 ] Thus , excessive pronation implicate numerous musculoskeletal complaint , pathologically re-distributing ground reaction force foot , [ 49 ] change patellar track femoral trochlea , [ 50 ] change angle pull muscular stabilizer low limb , induce functional leg length inequality alters hip spine loading . [ 1 ] Therefore , need address gap knowledge inform preventive intervention musculoskeletal sequellae . Biomechanical Changes Contribute Musculoskeletal Disease Risk As mention previously , permanent loss arch height occurs 40 % woman pregnancy lead excessive pronation foot . This foot posture cause increased rotation tibia [ 51 ] communicate across knee . These torque , turn , may increase compressive shear stress medial tibiofemoral lateral patellofemoral compartment knee . This important light previous work demonstrate elevate contact stress predictive development incident symptomatic knee osteoarthritis , [ 52 ] relative risk knee replacement surgery increase number pregnancy carry . [ 53 ] Closing Knowledge Gaps May Attenuate Musculoskeletal Disease Risk Women In consideration evidence date pregnancy lead drop arch loss arch may contribute musculoskeletal disease disablement , compel rationale characterize whether use arch support pregnancy prevent adverse change foot structure pregnancy . The propose study randomize woman either arch-supportive insole control group ( wear insole ) measure static dynamic arch structure early part first trimester 8 week postpartum . Successful completion inform extent loss arch height pregnancy ameliorate use conservative physical medicine intervention . This line research hold great potential inform preventive intervention reduce disproportionate risk musculoskeletal disease disability borne woman .</detailed_description>
