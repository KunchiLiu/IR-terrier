	<detailed_description>A randomized , double blind , placebo control clinical trial conduct neonatal high care unit Tygerberg Children 's Hospital ( TBCH ) Cape Town , South Africa period July 2011 August 2012 . The primary objective study assess effect probiotic incidence NEC high risk infant bear HIV-positive HIV-negative woman . All mother infant pair conform inclusion criterion provide write informed consent include study . Premature ( &lt; 34 week ' gestation ) very-low birth weight ( &lt; 1 250g ) HIV-exposed unexposed infant randomize study control group random-number table sequence assign statistician . Sample size determine statistician accord life birth statistic form institution . Participants enrol assigned respective group researcher two research assistant . Inclusion criteria mother include : ( 1 ) HIV-positive or-negative mother give birth premature low birth weight baby TBCH consent participate study ; ( 2 ) Only breastfeed mother , regardless HIV status ( 3 ) HIV-positive mother prevention mother child transmission ( PMTCT ) treatment schedule receive nevirapine zidovudine ( AZT ) well receive highly active antiretroviral ( HAART ) medication include study Babies include ( 1 ) bear prematurely birth weight ≥500g ≤1250g ; ( 2 ) HIV expose unexposed ; ( 3 ) HIV-exposed infant receive antiretroviral ( ARV ) medication ( 4 ) receive breast milk ( either mother donor breast milk ) . Breast milk HIV-positive mother pasteurize ( accord ward protocol ) administer infant . Infants exclude major abnormality gastroschisis , large omphalocele congenital diaphragmatic hernia Throughout study period , standard care protocol consist one dose ( 5 drop ) probiotic/placebo daily 4 week ( 28 day ) . This provide study group L. rhamnosus GG ( 0.35 x 109 colony-forming unit [ CFU ] ) B. infantis ( 0.35 x 109 CFU ) daily .

Both probiotic placebo mixed mother breast milk donor breast milk administration via orogastric tube orally . The probiotic/ placebo add breast milk researcher two research assistant blind involved routine care infant . Participants exit study day 28 birth upon discharge hospital . Data birth weight , estimate gestational age , gender , type delivery , Apgar score collect . Gestational age determine best estimate neonatal obstetrical care provider base upon physical examination infant . Anthropometrical measurement ( weight , length head circumference ) , intake output daily clinical progress note review . Infants evaluate daily development NEC attend neonatologists . Whenever study infant suspect NEC infant evaluate attend neonatologists conjunction pediatric radiologist categorize modify Bell 's classification . Infants develop Stage I Bell 's criterion require surgery exit study . Ethical approval grant Human Research Ethics Committee Faculty Health Sciences , Stellenbosch University Tygerberg Academic Hospital . The clinical trial registration number : DOH-27-0413-4277 . Data analysis perform Statistica Software ( version 11 ) . Frequencies group compare use likelihood ratio chi-square test mean group use t-tests . Statistical significance define p-value less 0.05 .</detailed_description>
