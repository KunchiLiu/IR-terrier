	<detailed_description>This Phase I open-label , dose escalation trial evaluate use Tice® BCG challenge future assessment vivo TB immunity . Subjects recruit target population reflect community large 2 VTEU site . It anticipate enrollment occur 14-month period . Subjects provide inform consent consider eligibility ( screen ) , 120 eligible , willing , healthy , HIV TB uninfected subject age 18 45 year , inclusive , enrol study intervention sequentially assign 1 4 dose group . Dose titration Tice® BCG 2x10^6 cfu 16x10^6 cfu deliver intradermally dose escalation format 4 group 30 subject per dose group . In first dose group , subject immunize intradermally single dose 2x10^6 cfu Tice® BCG . The Tice® BCG dos increase sequentially 2x10^6 cfu 4x10^6 cfu 8x10^6 cfu maximum dose 16x10^6 cfu follow assessment safety reactogenicity data previous dose group sentinel subject . Following administration Tice® BCG , intradermal ( ID ) site reaction assess least 30 minute well memory aid daily basis throughout first 15 day . Subjects also return clinic Days 22 , 25 , 29 , 32 , 36 , 39 , 43 , 46 , 50 , 53 , 57 evaluate ID challenge site , assess lymphadenopathy indicate base review interim medical history clinical assessment , review AEs/SAEs , concomitant medication health status , collect dispose return biohazard material . A final clinic visit perform approximately 3 month ( Day 99 ) follow administration Tice® BCG evaluate ID challenge site , assess lymphadenopathy indicate base review interim medical history clinical assessment , review SAEs health status . At approximately 6 month ( Day 181 ) follow administration Tice® BCG telephone call perform query SAEs may occur since last visit . Based information , subject may ask return clinic evaluate . The duration study subject approximately 7 8 month . Primary Objectives : 1 ) Evaluate safety different dos intradermal Tice® BCG use human challenge model Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection . 2 ) Examine BCG shed intradermal challenge sit administration different dos Tice® BCG TB naive healthy subject . 3 ) Evaluate reproducibility BCG shed time quantitative PCR culture technique . Secondary objective : 1 ) Determine tolerable dose intradermal Tice® BCG induce optimal reproducibility BCG shed . 2 ) Determine method mycobacterial quantitation result least variable result . 3 ) Characterize magnitude kinetics BCG shed intradermal Tice® BCG administration 4 different dos . Parent protocol sub-study 12-0096 .</detailed_description>
