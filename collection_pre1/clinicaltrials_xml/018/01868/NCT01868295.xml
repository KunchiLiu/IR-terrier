	<brief_summary>Tooth loss sleep problem common condition elder . Tooth loss influence sleep quality change shape low face upper airway . While study suggest sleep without denture worsen sleep quality toothless elder , others suggest opposite . Consequently , currently evidence-based practice guideline regard whether denture use night , dentists doctor know properly advise patient issue . To address knowledge gap , past 5 year carry research examine quality sleep group edentulous elder . In addition , conduct pilot study examine link night-time denture wear sleep . Our result indicate edentulous elder wear denture night high level daytime sleepiness . Furthermore , use denture night seem increase risk apneic event elder mild sleep disturbance . While intrigue , result require confirmation large sample . In line previous research , aim propose study produce reliable evidence clinical practice guideline could base could use dentist doctor treat toothless elder . We enroll 70 toothless elder randomly assign wear wear denture night two period 30 day . Sleep study conduct home participant . The participant also ask respond question sleep quality oral health-related quality life . Ultimately , result study help improve health quality life million elders Canada around world .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Nocturnal Wear Dentures Sleep Oral Health Related Quality Life</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Aging substantially increase risk edentulism sleep disturbance . These two chronic condition serious adverse consequence function quality life elder place significant burden Canadian health care system . Edentulism disturb sleep alteration craniofacial structure surround soft tissue . However , effect prosthetic rehabilitation edentulism sleep quality still well understood . While evidence suggest wear denture night worsen sleep quality lead severe sleep disturbance edentate elder , also study suggest opposite . The current controversy permit clinician engage evidence-based clinical decision-making . To enable development clinical practice guideline , solid evidence require . This propose randomized trial represent logical next step clinical investigation conduct multidisciplinary expert team oral health sleep researcher University Montreal , McGill University , University British Colombia , Laval University . Our pilot data suggest edentate elder wear denture night experience daytime sleepiness . Furthermore , find nocturnal use denture may increase risk apneic event senior affect mild sleep disturbance . OBJECTIVES The primary objective study test whether nocturnal denture wear effect sleep quality daytime sleepiness edentate elder moderate severe sleep apnea . Our secondary objective test whether nocturnal denture wear affect oral-health-related quality life edentate elder moderate severe sleep apnea . . The third objective identify moderator effect nocturnal denture wear determine patient subgroup intervention efficacious . METHODS We carry single-blind randomized cross-over clinical trial , 70 edentate elder enrol . Study participant assign wear wear denture alternate order two period 30 day . The primary outcome sleep quality ( measure apnea-hypopnea index ) . The secondary outcome daytime sleepiness oral health-related quality life . Outcome assessment carry portable polysomnography , Epworth Sleepiness Scale , oral health-related quality life questionnaire . Explanatory variable include socio-demographic factor , medical , anthropometric ( weight , height ) variable , oropharyngeal morphology , oral prosthesis characteristic , well perceive general health quality life . These characteristic assess clinical examination , 3D imaging ( Cone Beam Computed Tomography ) cranio-facial structure , well validated questionnaire . Assessments do baseline end 30-day intervention period . Linear mixed-effects regression model repeat measure fit test study hypothesis . The main analysis base intention-to-treat principle . To assess robustness finding potential incomplete adherence , sensitivity analysis conduct apply per-protocol principle . SIGNIFICANCE Our finding important clinical implication help resolve current uncertainty effect nocturnal wearing denture edentate elderly population . This practice-relevant evidence could enable development preventive approach improve sleep quality old population , thereby , improve well-being quality life . This evidence share Canadian Dental Association , Canadian American Academy Dental Sleep Medicine , Canadian Sleep Society assist agency produce practice guideline primary care provider , dentist , sleep medicine specialist involve care edentate elder .</detailed_description>
