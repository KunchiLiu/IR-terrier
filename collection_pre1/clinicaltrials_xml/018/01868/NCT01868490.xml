	<brief_summary>Cytokine-induced killer ( CIK ) cell exhibit high proliferation rate cytotoxic activity vitro . The major effector cell CD3+CD56+ subset . The cytolytic activity CIK cell independent MHC restriction implies feasibility use CIK cell allogeneic tumor . Experiments block MHC class-I -II pathways tumors-RNA transfected DCs show MHC class-I blocking lead significant reduction heterogeneous CIK cell cytotoxicity co-culture . The safety CIK cell demonstrate lack cytotoxicity toward autologous well allogeneic normal cell . Co-culture CIK cell dendritic cell ( DCs ) report u others myriad cancer ( e.g. , cholangiocarcinoma , osteosarcoma , glioblastoma multiforme , multiple myeloma , hepatocellular carcinoma , pancreatic carcinoma , renal &amp; colon carcinoma , murine leukemia &amp; lymphoma show enhancement anti-tumor cytotoxicity CIK cell . The co-culture CIK cell DCs report decrease number professional regulatory/ suppressor T cell ( Treg , CD4+CD25+ cell ) decrease secretion IL-10 , immune suppressor cytokine , whereas cytotoxic activity target cell increase . We recently bring CIK cell preclinical phase ( animal study ) human cholangiocarcinoma treatment . Cholangiocarcinoma ( CCA ) , bile duct epithelial cancer endemic Northeast Thailand , increase incidence discernible Europe North America . Conventional treatment include surgery , chemotherapy , radiation bring satisfactory survival due anatomic location , presence metastasis , high recurrent rate . These unsatisfactory outcome urge search innovative treatment immunotherapy . We report safety efficacy CIK cell SCID mouse model cholangiocarcinoma . Several condition human CIK cell examine use ex vivo cytotoxic assay SCID mice pre-inoculated human cholangiocarcinoma cell . We monitor ex vivo cytotoxicity , tumor size immunohistochemistry . Optimal tumor suppression observe CIK cell pre-exposed dendritic cell ( DCs ) . Tumor-infiltrating human CD3+ cell observe day 2 - 14 , normal tissue elsewhere . These altogether indicate specific home CIK cell tumor mass . All animal exhibit noticeable adverse reaction CIK treatment . The CD3+CD56+ cell logical candidate clinical trial DC-co-cultured CIK cell produce similar efficacy feasible clinical application . With complete array vitro vivo study , next rational step move forward phase I/II clinical trial number specify solid tumor ( i.e. , cholangiocarcinoma , osteosarcoma , glioblastoma multiforme , nueroblastoma ) use optimize autologous CIK cell . Subjects without prior exposure wean least 3 month chemotherapy recruit maintain integrity immunological system , critical factor successful immunotherapy .</brief_summary>
