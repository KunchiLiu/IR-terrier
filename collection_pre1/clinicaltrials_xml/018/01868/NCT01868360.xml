	<brief_summary>The cornea clear front part eye . Corneal neovascularization , excessive growth blood vessel cornea , sight-threatening condition . Corneal neovascularization also well recognize risk factor corneal graft failure . The current standard care prevent graft rejection include use topical steroid medicine suppress immune system . These medicine address corneal neovascularization . The purpose study establish safety potential efficacy subconjunctival injection aflibercept ( EYLEAÂ® , market Regeneron ) injection induce regression blood vessel grow cornea promote graft survival . This study conduct Dr. Balamurali Ambati Moran Eye Center .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Aflibercept Injection Treat Blood Vessel Growth Over Cornea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Corneal neovascularization sight threaten condition also well recognize risk factor corneal graft failure . Current standard care prevent graft rejection include use topical steroid immunosuppressant . These address corneal neovascularization . The cornea keep avascular state complex interaction signal proteins host receptor , vital role play soluble VEGF-receptor 1 . In condition chronic corneal inflammation hypoxia , balance may tip favour pro-angiogenic factor , neovascularization ensue . Early limited study examine effect subconjunctival intracorneal administration monoclonal antibody VEGF ( bevacizumab , ranibizumab ) combat corneal neovascularization . Most report subtotal temporary regression . The development aflibercept ( also know VEGF Trap-Eye ) offer new hope effectively combat problem . In study , research conduct investigate ass safety subconjunctival aflibercept injection patient corneal neovascularization undergo corneal transplantation . This phase 1 , prospective , randomize , open label clinical trial enroll 10 corneal transplant patient corneal neovascularization one quadrant cross 0.5 mm limbus time corneal transplantation .</detailed_description>
