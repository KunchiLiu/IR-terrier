	<brief_summary>This phase IB trial aim identify anticancer activity GSK3052230 subject malignancy abnormal dependence FGF pathway signal . Combination dose GSK3052230 standard care chemotherapy first second line great set metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) first line malignant pleural mesothelioma subject study 3+3 dose-escalation design . This multi-arm , multicenter , non-randomized , parallel-group , uncontrolled , open-label Phase IB study design evaluate safety , tolerability preliminary activity GSK3052230 combination paclitaxel + carboplatin ( Arm A ) , combination docetaxel ( Arm B ) , combination pemetrexed + cisplatin ( Arm C ) . Approximately 70 subject enrol study ( approximately 120 may enrol ) .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Signed write informed consent Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis : Arm A B stage IV recurrent metastatic squamous NSCLC Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 ( FGFR1 ) gene amplification central laboratory test . Arm C recurrent local therapy unresectable MPM measurable lesion . For specific arm follow requirement : Arm A : Subjects receive prior therapy Stage IIIB Stage IV recurrent metastatic disease . Note , avoid undue delay initiate systemic chemotherapy subject newly diagnose metastatic disease , allow initiate first cycle chemotherapy eligibility study still determine , long first dose GSK3052230 give later Cycle 2 Day 1 chemotherapy . In addition , subject Stage IIIB Stage IV disease recurrence previous NSCLC treat surgery adjuvant chemotherapy radio chemotherapy regimen curative intent eligible , provide 6 month pass since treatment end . Arm B : Subjects document tumor progression ( base radiological imaging ) intolerability receive least one prior line platinum contain combination chemotherapy Stage IIIB Stage IV recurrent metastatic disease . Note : Prior treatment include docetaxel may include paclitaxel . Arm C : Subjects receive prior systemic therapy MPM . Availability archival tumor tissue require assessment deregulate FGF pathway signal , limited , FGFR1 amplification FGF2 FGFR1 expression . If archival tissue available , fresh biopsy require . In Arms A B , subject prospectively screen FGFR1 gene amplification use Fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) assay dose expansion MTD/MFD cohort . For inclusion study , base central laboratory testing , FGFR1 gene amplification must meet one follow criterion : ratio FGFR1/CEN 8 &gt; =2 ; average number FGFR1 signal per tumor nucleus &gt; =6 ; percentage tumor nucleus contain &gt; =5 FGFR1 signal &gt; =50 % . In Arm C , FGF2 expression IHC evaluate retrospectively tissue sample central laboratory requirement study entry . Measurable disease per RECIST version 1.1 ( Arm A B ) modify RECIST Arm C.
