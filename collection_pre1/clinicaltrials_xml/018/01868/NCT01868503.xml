	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well lapatinib ditosylate radiation therapy work treat patient locally advance locally recurrent breast cancer . Lapatinib ditosylate may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Radiation therapy use high energy x ray kill tumor cell . Giving lapatinib ditosylate together radiation therapy may effective treatment breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lapatinib Ditosylate Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Locally Recurrent Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess clinical complete response rate ( CR ) concurrent lapatinib ( lapatinib ditosylate ) radiotherapy patient locally advance locally recurrent breast cancer refractory chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate feasibility assess breast cancer stem cell ( BCSCs ) use flow cytometry single cell gene expression profile ( SCGEP ) . II . To determine change proportion BCSCs combine modality therapy . III . To evaluate safety efficacy combination lapatinib radiotherapy . IV . To assess pathologic complete response rate ( pCR ) undergo surgical resection . OUTLINE : Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1 completion radiation therapy . Beginning day 7 , patient undergo radiation therapy 5-7 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2-4 week 6-12 week .</detailed_description>
