	<brief_summary>The goal study evaluate safety efficacy endoscopic spray cryotherapy use CSA Medical , Inc. truFreeze System patient previously untreated early-stage cancer ( T1a , N0 , M0 ) ineligible refuse conventional therapy include surgery , chemotherapy , radiation therapy , endoscopic resection . It hypothesize one two follow outcome occur : 1 . Complete response therapy : complete tumor eradication confirm histologic examination biopsy specimen target esophageal tissue site ; 2 .

	<brief_title>Spray Cryotherapy Esophageal Cancer ( ICE-CANCER )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Endoscopic modality report effective definitive treatment early stage esophageal cancer . A study compare endoscopic treatment surgery early esophageal cancer use SEER ( Surveillance Epidemiology End Results ) database show difference relative hazard death esophageal cancer two group . The primary endoscopic therapy use study endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) . Estimated 1 3 year survival study 92 % 75 % endoscopic arm 92 % 82 % surgical arm . EMR , endoscopic excision superficial cancer , also show highly effective mucosal tumor single center study . `` Low-risk '' lesion , define flat raise mucosal tumor 2 cm less well-or moderately-differentiated without lymphovascular invasion , demonstrate complete response see 96.6 % patient 5 year survival 84 % . However , `` high-risk lesion , '' define great 2 cm , poorly-differentiated , flat-ulcerated , invade submucosa , complete remission rate 59 % . Endoscopic resection possible mucosal cancer . Some cancer visible endoscopically detect endoscopic biopsy . In case , EMR do due scar previous resection therapy , especially external beam radiation . Management case problematic . PDT use porfimer sodium extensively study Barrett 's esophagus high-grade dysplasia , however study PDT early stage esophageal cancer limit . In recent single site study use PDT EMR mucosal cancer , overall survival comparable group treat esophagectomy center , estimate 1 3 year survival 98 % 95 % . PDT use 43 % combination EMR endoscopic treatment group . Recurrent carcinoma detect 16 % endoscopically treated patient . All recurrence intramucosal cancer , one manage EMR . Overall , endoscopic treatment well-tolerated . However , side effect PDT common include photosensitivity , esophageal stricture , chest pain , nausea , vomit , fever . In U.S. , PDT long commonly use esophagus due availability alternative treatment modality less cost side effect . Endoscopic spray cryotherapy liquid nitrogen emerge alternative treatment stage I esophageal cancer suitable therapy . A recent retrospective review 10 U.S. center assess outcomes seventy-nine patient . Patients include esophageal carcinoma fail , refuse , ineligible conventional therapy include chemotherapy , radiation , combination chemotherapy radiation , esophagectomy , endoscopic mucosal resection . The majority patient ( 76 % ) tumor stage T1N0M0 mean tumor length 4 cm . All patient treat liquid nitrogen spray cryotherapy , forty-nine patient complete treatment . Complete response luminal disease occur 61.2 % , include 18 24 ( 75 % ) mucosal cancer . Follow-up average 10.6 11.5 month , serious adverse event report . Longer term follow-up report recently abstract form . Complete response see 92 % patient mucosal cancer median follow-up 28 month overall estimate survival 1 3 year 98 % 92 % respectively . Published study demonstrate spray cryotherapy safe well-tolerated , low overall complication rate . Tolerance procedure good . All procedure perform outpatient basis . Primary side effect include chest pain , dysphagia , odynophagia , report half procedure . Mean duration symptom 3.6 day , many patient side effect treatment . Serious adverse event rare . Gastric perforation occur one patient Marfan 's syndrome . Benign esophageal stricture report 13 % patient treated cancer , previous esophageal narrow note 9/10 . In combination relative cost-effectiveness minimal invasiveness , endoscopic spray cryotherapy appeal option stage I esophageal cancer ineligible refuse conventional therapy . Study Device : truFreezeTM System , CSA Medical Inc. , Baltimore , MD Study Objective : The objective study evaluate safety efficacy endoscopic spray cryotherapy use CSA Medical , Inc. truFreeze™ System patient early-stage esophageal cancer ( T1a , N0 , M0 ) ineligible refuse conventional therapy include surgery , chemotherapy , radiation therapy , endoscopic resection . Study Design : Multi-center phase II study . Study Population : Patients early-stage esophageal cancer ( stage T1aN0M0 ) Study Duration : It estimate enrollment take approximately two year . Each subject remain study one-year treatment three year post-treatment . It expect take five year collect require data study . Sample size : 40 Treatment Participant receive liquid nitrogen spray cryotherapy every 4 - 8 week x 8 cycle . Those complete response therapy proceed surveillance . Those stable respond disease continue cryotherapy . Those progression disease discontinue protocol . For respond stable disease 8 cycle , continue treatment beyond 8 cycle tumor progression unacceptable toxicity . Discontinue protocol therapy disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Follow-Up Evaluations Data Collection Patients return surveillance EGD ( esophagogastroduodenoscopy ) procedures biopsy 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 month ( ± 4 week ) last cryotherapy treatment . An estimate tumor size response compare baseline make endoscopy . Biopsies perform use large capacity forceps . In area tumor present , biopsy take every 1 cm quadrant . Directed biopsy perform area appear suspicious cancer . CT scan chest , abdomen , pelvis ( oral intravenous contrast possible ) perform every 6 month follow-up period . Full body PET/CT may also perform instead CT scan . Endoscopic ultrasound perform 6 month treatment completion ass lymphadenopathy . At conclusion protocol , regardless outcome , patient continue require periodic surveillance endoscopy re-emergence esophageal cancer consistent standard surveillance guideline . This monitoring perform investigator 's site unless otherwise desire patient .</detailed_description>
