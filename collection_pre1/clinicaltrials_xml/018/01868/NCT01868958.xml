	<detailed_description>More half middle-aged population radiologic evidence cervical spondylosis subset population develop cervical spondylotic myelopathy ( CSM ) , condition spinal cord impair , either direct mechanical compression indirectly arterial deprivation and/or venous stasis . Although many operation perform condition related CSM , consensus exist regard time surgical intervention select among available surgical option give patient . Many factor implicate propensity CSM develop include advanced age , disability presentation , cord diameter , cord area , alter cord signal MRI ( T2- T1- weight image ) , increase cervical spinal mobility congenitally narrow spinal canal . The factor may also determine response surgery , either positively ( increased cervical mobility ) negatively ( advanced age , congenitally narrow spinal canal ) . The potential complication surgical procedure noteworthy . Although incapacitate adverse effect uncommon , occurrence disease process potentially benign course undoubted gravity . Finally , note radiologic criterion cervical root cord compression MRI subjective uncertain correlate clinical symptom . Diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) sensitive motion water consider marker axonal integrity brain . There much interest apply technique spine particular evaluation patient CSM . In brain DTI perform use single shot echo planar imaging ( SS-EPI ) sequence acquire data single slice follow application single excitation pulse diffusion gradient . While efficient term data collection several problem SS-EPI , notably 1 ) It best suit acquisition relatively small imaging matrix , result either low spatial resolution use additional technique reduce field view ( FOV ) . Increasing number echo acquire increase resolution produce increase acquire resolution since decay signal longer echo train result increase blurring image . 2 ) The image distort susceptibility gradient area close interface tissue bone osseous structure . These factor make apply DTI clinical study spine problematic . Specifically : - 1 . The small size spinal cord mean high spatial resolution require . 2 . The susceptibility effect surround osseous structure result image distortion . 3 . The motion cord cardiac cycle lead artifact . Readout segment EPI ( RESOLVE RS-EPI ) sequence show capable obtain image higher spatial resolution reduce distortion brain . We recently demonstrate RESOLVE sequence also use obtain high quality DTI image cervical spine volunteer ( see figure 1 ) provide clinically useful information subject metastases spine . The RESOLVE sequence break data collection several segment , result reduce distortion potential obtain image high resolution , cost either increase scan time reduce number direction diffusion gradient ( i.e . reduce signal noise ratio ( SNR ) ) . The RESOLVE sequence also incorporate real-time assessment data , enable data corrupt motion reject reacquired . We wish optimize , assess clinical utility , RESOLVE sequence patient CSM apply group CSM patient group age match control subject . The raw diffusion image post-processed yield parametric image characterize diffusivity ( mean , longitudinal radial ) anisotropy ( directional dependence ) diffusion . The anisotropy diffusion data typically quantify use fractional anisotropy ( FA ) index , however , recently show two quantity , mode ellipsoidal area ratio ( EAR ) diffusion tensor , provide useful supplementary information propose use three parameter analyze anisotropy diffusion data study . Using RESOLVE sequence address first two `` bullet '' point list found subject high quality DTI image spine obtain without use cardiac gating , however , robust clinical sequence , group , find cardiac gate essential . Another issue consider DTI study spine orientation scan . Sagittal image provide coverage whole spine relatively slice , particularly beneficial cardiac gate employ . Axial slice advantage change configuration spine caudal-cranial direction relatively slow , mean thicker slice use without significant loss information . However , relatively large number slice still require cover entire C-spine result lengthy measurement time cardiac gating use . Objectives The investigator wish try answer follow question C-spine : - 1 . What diffusion characteristic normal C-spine ( spatial variation age dependence ) ? 2 . How RESOLVE SS-EPI image spine compare term image quality ? 3 . What effect change number segment RESOLVE sequence ? 4 . When compare SS-EPI RESOLVE statistically significant difference derive value anisotropy diffusivity ? 5 . Are diffusion characteristic C-spine subject CSM significantly different age matched control ? 6 . Can DTI spine use derive diagnostic information , either term prognostic information individual CSM patient identification sub-groups CSM patient ? For brain question would address : - 1 ) When compare SS-EPI RESOLVE statistically significant difference derive value anisotropy diffusivity ? 2 ) Is statistically significant difference volume fiber tract derive use two sequence two group ? 3 ) Is diffusion data brain patient CSM significantly different control ?</detailed_description>
