	<brief_summary>This research study Phase II clinical trial , test safety effectiveness investigational drug learn whether drug work treat specific cancer . `` Investigational '' mean drug study . It also mean FDA yet approve sunitinib type cancer . Sunitinib approve FDA treatment gastrointestinal stromal tumor , advance renal cell carcinoma advance pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor . While chemotherapy work interfere cancer cell replication , sunitinib work block certain protein signal within cell . Because sunitinib work differently standard intravenous chemotherapy , call `` targeted therapy . '' This drug also use research study information research study suggest agent may help slow growth NSCLC tumor . In research study , look see sunitinib may stop certain NSCLC tumor grow . The study focus type NSCLC , adenocarcinoma , previously find sensitive kind oral targeted therapy . This study focus specifically ( 1 ) adenocarcinoma tumor carry mutation know cancer gene ( EGFR , KRAS , ALK ) occur patient never smoke ( less 100 cigarette lifetime ) ( 2 ) adenocarcinoma tumor mutation RET gene .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives - To evaluate objective response rate ( ORR ) sunitinib never-smokers lung cancer wild-type EGFR , KRAS , ALK single-arm phase II trial Secondary Objectives - To identify oncogenic alteration underlie sensitivity sunitinib perform nextgeneration sequencing ( NGS ) lung cancer treat sunitinib - To explore activity sunitinib lung cancer know harbor RET rearrangements genomic alteration target sunitinib ( e.g . cKIT , PDGFRa , PDGFRb ) .</detailed_description>
