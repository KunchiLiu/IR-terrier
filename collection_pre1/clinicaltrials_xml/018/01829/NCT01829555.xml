	<brief_summary>Glucose control necessary avoid immediate long-term adverse effect associate type 1 diabetes , frequent self-monitoring blood glucose first important step achieve glucose control . Data suggest large proportion adolescent young adult fail adhere standard guideline self-monitored blood glucose test hemoglobin A1c level &gt; 7.5 % . A finite period poor metabolic control lead increase risk medical complication individual 's lifespan , necessitate novel intervention improve self-monitored blood glucose test metabolic control emerge adult type 1 diabetes . The investigator treatment approach , provide direct tangible reinforcement objective evidence behavior change , efficacious decrease substance use , reduce weight , improve medication adherence . The purpose project develop pilot test intervention base behavioral economic principle improve self-monitored blood glucose test young person type 1 diabetes . In pilot study , patient text , via cell phone , time test , return text inform reinforcer voucher earn . The investigator collect data self-monitored blood glucose test frequency A1c level precede treatment initiation throughout 6 month treatment period . If promising , randomize trial lead large scale evaluation reinforcement intervention alone , combination multimodal treatment approach , may apply clinical issue adherence continuous glucose monitoring . Importantly , intervention administer remotely automated fashion , allow widespread adoption efficacious .</brief_summary>
