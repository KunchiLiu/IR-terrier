	<brief_summary>Intracerebral hemorrhage [ ICH ] fear complication anticoagulant therapy [ OAC ] . Evidence regard acute therapeutic intervention well secondary treatment approach still limit . Therefore , German-wide observational cohort study retrospectively identify evaluate OAC-associated ICH patient admit 20 participate tertiary centre 5-year period . The main focus investigation , besides epidemiological aspect , ( ) acute management OAC-ICH , ( ii ) secondary therapy ( anticoagulant management ) ( iii ) long-term outcome OAC-ICH .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Stroke general one lead cause death disability industrialize world . Cardiac thromboembolism major contributor ischemic infarction frequent reason atrial fibrillation [ afib ] . The prevalence afib constantly increase within age population establish therapy ( oral anticoagulation ) increase alongside . Therefore , rate OAC-ICH expect increase simultaneously . As compare spontaneous ICH , OAC-ICH associate large ICH-volumes , increase mortality poorer functional outcome . Nevertheless , limit evidence available treatment severely injured patient . The sound benefit report strategy `` INR-reversal soon possible '' . More detailed therapeutic approach guideline well establish . Many question regard acute treatment strategy remain investigated ( modus INR reversal , prevention hematoma growth , operative procedure , aso ) . Moreover , press question need answered relate coagulation management OAC-ICH . Would patient benefit resumption OAC ? Which patient would benefit ? What complication rate ( thromboembolic versus bleeding ) accord treatment ? How outcome influenced different therapeutic strategy ? This observational cohort study try strengthen therapeutic evidence OAC-ICH treatment retrospective data-pooling 20 nation-wide tertiary hospital Germany . Patients identify medical record diagnosis ICH concomitantly present intake OAC ( INR &gt; 1.4 ) time period 2006-2010 . Only patient ICH associate OAC include , secondary cause i.e . tumor , trauma , vascular malformation etc . exclude . Following parameter evaluate : + prior medical history ( CHADS-VASC-Score , HAS-Bled Score , risk factor ) functional status prior admission ; + Timing symptom - admission , - imaging , - therapy initiation ; + acute therapy ( INR reversal , blood pressure , hematoma growth ) ; + complication treatment ( thrombosis-prophylaxis , infection , transfusion , etc . ) ; + Mortality rate ( discharge , 3 month 1 year , overall long-term ) ; + functional outcome mRS ( discharge , 3 month 1 year , overall long-term ) ; + secondary prophylaxis ( OAC vs. platelet inhibitor ) ; + bleeding versus thromboembolic-events .</detailed_description>
