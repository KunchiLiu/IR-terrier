	<brief_summary>Diabetic kidney disease ( DKD ) associate high rate cardiovascular event death . In addition , DKD major cause end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) United States . The purpose study prevent progression kidney disease among patient DKD uncontrolled hypertension ( HTN ) use tailor , telehealth intervention simultaneously address medication management modify multiple risk factor combination patient self-monitoring , behavioral therapy education optimize adherence self-efficacy . Additional goal improve control cardiovascular disease risk factor reduce cardiovascular event death . We hypothesize patient DKD uncontrolled HTN receive intervention less progression , small decrease kidney function , 3 year compare education control group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A randomize , control trial slow DKD progression : 1 . Using innovative telehealth approach potentially scalable demonstrable efficacy reduce antecedent kidney disease , include poor blood pressure , glucose , lipid control 2 . Enrolling demographically diverse patient local primary care clinic allow applicability result general US population within exist delivery system ; 3 . Targeting patient moderate DKD ( estimate glomerular filtration rate 45-90 ml/min/1.73m2 evidence diabetic nephropathy ) uncontrolled HTN ( blood pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg ) , account 20 % patient diabetes disproportionately suffer end-stage renal disease ( ESRD ) , cardiovascular event , death .</detailed_description>
