	<brief_summary>This phase I clinical trial study side effect best dose lenalidomide ibrutinib give together rituximab treat patient previously untreated stage II-IV follicular lymphoma . Lenalidomide may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Ibrutinib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , find cancer cell help kill . Giving lenalidomide ibrutinib together rituximab may work well treat follicular lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab , Lenalidomide , Ibrutinib Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Stage II-IV Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine recommended phase II dose ibrutinib lenalidomide combination rituximab previously untreated follicular lymphoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine pharmacokinetics ibrutinib major metabolite ( PCI-45227 ) combine lenalidomide rituximab . II . To determine pharmacodynamics basophil activation Bruton tyrosine kinase ( BTK ) occupancy peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) 24-hour period ibrutinib give combination lenalidomide rituximab . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study lenalidomide ibrutinib . Patients receive lenalidomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 ibrutinib PO QD day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 18 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients also receive rituximab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 course 1 weekly week 13 , 21 , 29 , 37 . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 4 month 2 year every 6 month 8 year .</detailed_description>
