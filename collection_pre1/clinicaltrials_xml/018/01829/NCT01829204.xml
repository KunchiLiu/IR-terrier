	<detailed_description>Our approach specifically target evaluation protein cytokines present bacteriological analysis microflora vaginal milieu . Conjectures : - An initial insult vagina ( possibly involve bacterial , viral fungal organism product ) cause modification vaginal milieu - The vaginal milieu respond insult develop inflammatory reaction characterize cytokine protein production - Long lasting repetitive insult maintain biochemical change vaginal milieu produce reaction , chemical irritation micro flora alteration change proteins and/or abnormal protein production - Those change eventually result hypersensitivity , irritation , burning , pain manifest patient vulvodynia . And change may also result recurrence fungal bacterial infection - Those change may also contribute initiate cascade premature event conduct cervical effacement dilation observe preterm labor The conjecture investigate use multidisciplinary approach include : microbiology , proteomics cytokine evaluation vaginal milieu . Specifically compare asymptomatic female population serve baseline patient affect vulvodynia , recurrent fungal bacterial vaginosis and/or pregnancy . This prospective , descriptive study 550 woman age 12 75 year . There four group : 1 ) Asymptomatic healthy woman , 2 ) Women see gynecological vulvovaginal condition , 3 ) Pregnant woman asymptomatic healthy , 4 ) Pregnant woman gynecological vulvovaginal condition . We evaluate follow : - Types cytokine normally present woman patient vulvodynia , recurrent fungal bacterial vaginosis preterm labor - Normal microbiology flora woman variation present vaginal milieu patient - The presence normal atypical protein vaginal milieu healthy woman patient vulvodynia , recurrent fungal bacterial vaginosis preterm labor - Informed consent obtain document participation study - Comprehensive history assessment environmental factor , topical vulvovaginal issue co morbid condition define exclusion criterion . - Pelvic examination obtain two sample via cotton swab proteomics , cytokine , vaginal lactobacillus vaginal secretion . A. Swab procedure : The cotton swab ( 2 ) introduce middle vagina , one time , area sample . B. Swab process One swab place special room temperature solution . This de-identified swab mail Lactobacillus . The second de-identified swab place 2 separate micro-containers Liquid Nitrogen Containers ( one cytokines one Proteomics ) . When 50 sample complete processed TTUHSC Permian Basin campus , Proteomics test do Lubbock . Therefore , 3 sample , process differently . Data record confidential manner personal identifier , assign study subject number . As , de-identified data may serve database additional study . The computer use belong TTUHSC password protect , access limit authorized personnel . Consent form store separately study data research office .</detailed_description>
