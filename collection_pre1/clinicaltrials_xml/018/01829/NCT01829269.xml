	<brief_summary>The average survival rate defibrillation lead 91 99 % 2 year , 85-95 % 5 year 60-72 % 8 year . We must also manage alert defibrillation probe high complication rate average . We therefore increasingly confront faulty sensor risk replace . There standardized approach replace defibrillation lead . A record make United States show significant difference accord team strategy case failure defibrillation lead particular regard decision explant abandon probe . The risk extract defibrillation lead well know major complication rate 1.6 1.95 % . Regarding risk complication related abandonment probe less data . For risk abandon defibrillation lead . But others report complication rate 5.5 % related pacing discontinue . Main objective : Collect attitude different center different operator replace fail defibrillation lead `` risk . '' Explantation abandonment sensor replace .</brief_summary>
