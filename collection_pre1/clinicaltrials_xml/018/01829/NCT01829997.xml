	<brief_summary>Spine fusion one common procedure perform spinal surgery . Several surgical technique achieve solid union , intertransverse posterolateral fusion ( PLF ) widely use . However , complication develop bone graft material use insufficient achieve desire fusion . With unique property , nanOss Bioactive 3D mixed bone marrow aspirate ( BMA ) autograft bone obtain new bone growth heal process . nanOss Bioactive 3D approve use U.S. , however , additional information useful ass efficacy posterolateral spine . The purpose study assess fusion result posterolateral spine use nanOss Bioactive 3D mixed autograft bone BMA . It hypothesize use nanOss Bioactive 3D result fusion 12 month , CT evidence bridge trabecular bone , less 3mm translational motion , less 5 degree angular motion .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The post market clinical investigation design assess instrument PLF use nanOss Bioactive 3D bone void filler autograft bone bone marrow aspirate patient symptomatic spinal stenosis secondary degenerative disc disease ( DDD ) Grade 1 spondylolisthesis one two adjacent level L2-S1 characterize inclusion exclusion criterion . Patients evaluate Preop , discharge , 6 12 month . X-rays obtained visit ; Additionally , CT scan perform 12 month postoperative visit ass fusion status .</detailed_description>
