One two long act anti-cholinergic medication dosage offer ( Long act Tolterodine Extended Release Oxybutynin equivalent generic substitute ) . Participants continue receive medication one year . FMRI Description : FMRI Data Acquisition : High resolution T1 anatomic image collect begin session . Echo-planar image collect use single-shot , gradient-echo . FMRI Task : Presentation software program control stimulus presentation , synchronize stimulus event collect data . Subjects instruct maintain visual fixation centrally present cross eye-tracking device record saccade scan undergoing bladder fill empty . Image Processing : fMRI data obtain task include slice , temporal auto-correlations motion correction . Voxel-wise multiple regression analysis use estimate beta weight correspond functional activation result condition . Multiple regression contain individually tailor demeaned regressors correspond subject 's desire void ( urge regressor ) , resemble step function ; button press signal increasing/decreasing level desire void convolve gamma variate function derive parameter hemodynamic response . A regressor correspond bladder emptying/filling create convolve experimental time-course gamma variate function , connectivity analysis perform . Functional connectivity measure specific point remainder brain . Averaged individual residualized time-courses sphere primary regressor whole-brain BOLD connectivity analysis . Pearson 's correlation coefficient convert z-scores use Fisher 's method blur use 10 mm Gaussian kernel contrast across group use independent sample T-tests . Statistical Analysis : For RCT- Investigators perform sample size calculation change UUI episode change OABq-SF score base investigator ' pilot data &amp; literature.6,7 The study use non-inferiority design primary outcome ( UUI episode change hypnotherapy versus pharmacotherapy ) . A one-sided non-inferiority test alpha = 0.25 non-inferiority margin 5 % use . If μ_h population mean percent reduction UUI episodes hypnotherapy , μ_m population mean percent reduction UUI episodes medication , investigator test H_0 : μ_h-μ_m≤-5 one-sided alternative H_0 : μ_h-μ_m &gt; -5 use significance level 0.025 . If null hypothesis reject , investigator may conclude hypnotherapy inferior medication , average , 5 % , fact may superior medication therapy , percent reduction incontinence episode . The test may perform compute low 97.5 % one-sided confidence bound μ_h-μ_m . If low confidence bound exceed -5 % investigator conclude non-inferiority hypnotherapy . Superiority conclude low bound exceed zero . Assuming drop-out , withdrawal , miss data rate high 33 % , 52 subject available analysis group . If μ_h-μ_m≥9 % , sample size would provide power ≥ 80 % non-inferiority testing . Improvement group compare baseline 2 , 6 , 12 month follow-up . Parameters compare use generalize linear mixed model analysis . If baseline difference group find , appropriate variable add analysis covariates . Primary analysis perform use intention treat . Per protocol analysis additionally perform . Similar analysis perform compare group difference change questionnaire score .
