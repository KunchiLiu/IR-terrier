	<brief_summary>Systemic sclerosis orphan , multiorgan disease affect connective tissue skin internal organ . Cardiac involvement , mainly characterise small intramyocardial coronary artery involvement myocardial fibrosis , cause development impair diastolic ventricular filling , cardiac block ventricular arrhythmia , ensue congestive heart failure sudden death . Until , drug proven therapeutic effect SSc myocardial disease evidence-based level . Short-term trial retrospective study suggest favourable protective effect calcium channel blocker angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor patient myocardial involvement . However , data presently available prevention treatment severe heart disease . This observational trial part collaborative project `` DeSScipher '' , one five observational trial decipher optimal management systemic sclerosis . Aim observational trial ass efficacy safety calcium channel blocker angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor asymptomatic SSc patient cardiac involvement .</brief_summary>
