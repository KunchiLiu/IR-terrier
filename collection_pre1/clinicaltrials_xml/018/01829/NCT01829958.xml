	<criteria>Subjects meet follow criterion eligible enrollment study ( unless exclude ) : ≥60 year old Pathologically confirm NHL . Must meet criteria initiation treatment ; consist : Aggressive histology , Indolent histology one follow marker large tumor burden ( 67 ) : Any nodal extranodal tumor mass ≥7cm great dimension ≥3 nodal mass ≥3 cm great dimension Systemic symptom Cytopenias ( leukocytes &lt; 1 × 109/L and/or platelet ,100 × 109/L ) Substantial splenomegaly Serous effusion ( plural effusion peritoneal ascites ) Orbital epidural involvement Ureteral compression Leukemic phase ( malignant cell ≥5 x 109/L ) Must start new chemotherapy regimen ( patient whose treatment regimen include immunomodulatory agent lenalidomide small molecule target agent Ibrutinib Idelelasib include study ; patient treat single agent monoclonal antibody include ) . Fluent English ( component GA validate language ) Able provide inform consent In addition , subject meet follow criterion enrol prephase arm study , accrual target arm reach : Age ≥ 70 year OR KPS ≤ 70 Pathologically confirm diagnosis DLBCL , without simultaneous antecedent indolent lymphoma . Previously untreated DLBCL Intended initial treatment include ≥2 cycle RCHOP , REPOCH RCEPP use standard dos schedule . ( 68 , 69 ) RCHOP chemoimmunotherapy may give every 14 day every 21 day . ( 4 , 70 ) Subjects meet follow criterion exclude enrollment study : Enrollment Phase I trial Previously enrollment study Patients score ≥ 11 BOMC ( imply cognitive impairment ) exclude since ability reliably complete questionnaire doubt Subjects meeting follow criterion exclude enrollment prephase arm study , may include GA arm . Contraindication use rituximab prednisone include : Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus Systemic fungal infection Evidence active hepatitis B infection ( i.e . patient test positive hepatitis B surface antigen viral DNA PCR analysis ) exclude . Patients evidence past infection without active viremia ( i.e . positive hepatitis B core antibody , negative hepatitis B surface antigen negative hepatitis B DNA PCR ) treat entecavir per institutional guideline may include study . History serious adverse reaction either corticosteroid rituximab include rituximab infusion reaction ≤ Grade 3 . Patients enrol another clinical trial prohibits use prephase therapy component .</criteria>
