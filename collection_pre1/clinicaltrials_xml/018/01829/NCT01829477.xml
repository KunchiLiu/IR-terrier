	<brief_title>Comparison TAK-875 Placebo Add-on Glimepiride Patients With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call TAK-875 . TAK-875 test treat people diabetes . This study look glycosylated hemoglobin ( blood glucose combine hemoglobin , also know HbA1c ) blood sugar level people take TAK-875 addition glimepiride diet exercise . The study enroll approximately 260 patient . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one two treatment groups—which remain undisclosed patient study doctor study ( unless urgent medical need ) : - TAK-875 50 mg - Placebo ( dummy inactive pill ) - tablet look like study drug active ingredient . All participant ask take one tablet time day throughout study . This multi-center trial conduct North America Europe . The overall time participate study 44 week participant make 17 visit clinic . Due potential concern liver safety , balance , benefit treat patient fasiglifam ( TAK-875 ) outweigh potential risk . For reason , Takeda decide voluntarily terminate development activity fasiglifam .</detailed_description>
