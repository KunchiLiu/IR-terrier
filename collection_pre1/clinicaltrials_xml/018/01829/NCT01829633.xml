	<brief_summary>Study population : Patients treat physiotherapy potentially repairable rotator cuff tear period 2002 2005 . Study Method : At time diagnosis ( 2002 2005 ) study patient examine clinically , sonographically MRI . Some patient also complete shoulder score . All study patient reexamine , 8 10 year diagnose . Reexamination include history taking , clinical examination , completion three shoulder score ( two shoulder specific score , one general health score ) , Sonography MRI . Findings interest - number relapse follow-up , - need surgical treatment follow-up , - deterioration tear anatomy ( tear size , muscle atrophy , fatty degeneration ) follow-up - actual clinical shoulder condition ( give shoulder score ) reexamination . Study purpose : We want assess anatomic clinical long-term result physiotherapy potentially repairable rotator cuff tear . We want find tear anatomy unrepaired rotator cuff tear deteriorate time deterioration associate development serious degree symptom .</brief_summary>
