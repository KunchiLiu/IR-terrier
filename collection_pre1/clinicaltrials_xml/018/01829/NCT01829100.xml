	<brief_summary>Psychological therapy depression demonstrate efficacy , outcome still unsatisfactory , especially case high comorbidity . Depression anxiety co-occur 69-75 % teen intensify functional impairment service use . This study develop treatment material transdiagnostic Group Behavioral Activation Therapy ( GBAT ) conduct pilot waitlist-controlled school-based study 35 7th 8th grade boy girls co-occurring depression anxiety . Multi-reporter , multi-domain assessment conduct initial screening , pre- post-treatment , 4-month follow-up . BA straightforward , flexible robust , therapy demonstrate strong result adult . Current formulation BA highlight specific role avoidance depressotypic behavior . It presume anhedonia , isolation , negative behavior associate depression function avoid imminent distress even block access otherwise available positive reinforcement . This study therefore employ novel electronic diary technology obtain Ecological Momentary Assessment evaluate : ( ) function avoidance distinguish youth depression ( n=35 ) non-clinical comparison group ( n=18 ) , ( b ) role avoidance mediate treatment gain participant GBAT intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aims Hypotheses : This study develop treatment material transdiagnostic Group Behavioral Activation Therapy ( GBAT ) . It conduct double-gated screen middle-school student ( N=895 ) identify youth subclinical clinical DSM-IV-TR anxiety mood disorder . Eligible youth ( N=35 ) participate randomize clinical trial GBAT 21 randomly assign GBAT 14 15-week waitlist period . This address critical need develop first-line early intervention evidence-based efficiently address commonly co-occurring problem setting treatment need . Aim 1 . To develop treatment material test GBAT 's feasibility ( e.g. , recruitment retention rate , therapist adherence ) acceptability youth participant ( client satisfaction , group cohesion , homework completion ) . Aim 2 . To estimate initial efficacy GBAT compare waitlist ( WL ) control randomize pilot study 35 youth ( 21 assign two GBAT group ; 14 assign WL ) . It hypothesize GBAT show great pre- post-treatment outcome primary ( clinical diagnosis , symptom severity ) secondary measure ( achievement target goal , reduce avoidance , social academic adjustment ) . Youth receive GBAT also show linear improvement outcome measure pretreatment four-month follow-up . A second major goal project understand functional role avoidance depression . Participating youth carry Electronic Diaries ( EDs ; i.e. , ipod touch ) throughout active treatment follow-up phase complete twice-daily report negative event , emotional behavioral response , perceive function one 's response . A non-clinical comparison group ( n=18 ) also carry EDs two-week period . Such Ecological Momentary Assessment ( EMA ) data use effectively youth population determine impact positive negative coping response depressive symptom . Aim 3 . The research suggest depress youth seek depressogenic activity respond less positive event . Based EMA data , study hypothesizes , compare non-clinical comparison : ( ) depress youth identify event negative day , ( b ) depress youth respond great negativity non-depressed youth , ( c ) cop strategy use avoidant aim disengagement , ( ) function strategy minimize distress conflict . Furthermore , youth receive GBAT , compare WL participant , demonstrate increase ratio engagement-based avoidance-based coping strategy pre- post-treatment 4-mo FU .</detailed_description>
