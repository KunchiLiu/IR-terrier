The first study attempt identify adequate intensity interactive book reading treatment child SLI . Here , word randomize treatment treatment ( i.e. , test ) condition child randomize different intensity treatment . Specifically , child hear treat word either 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 time treatment . The second study test adequate intensity compare two version treatment within adequate intensity . Each child receive two treatment identify adequate intensity . Children randomize two treatment . One treatment balance amount time new word heard within book amount time book read . The second treatment heavily weight either repetition within book amount time book read . This study examine much child different language skill benefit adequate intensity . In addition , study examine best achieve adequate intensity . Specifically , good hear word often session read book time balance ? In treatment condition , word randomize repetition session repetition read book . At conclusion research , adequate intensity manner achieve intensity interactive book reading identify child SLI .
