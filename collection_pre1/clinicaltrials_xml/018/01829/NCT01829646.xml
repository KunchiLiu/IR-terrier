	<detailed_description>1 . BACKGROUND AND SETTING 1.1 . Introduction Concurrent ( chemo- ) radiotherapy ( CRT ) current standard care patient locally advanced head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) . The proximity important functional structure tumour make treatment however highly complex . While locoregional control rate improve last decade , treatment related toxicity severe xerostomia dysphagia gravely complicate patient 's quality life . Furthermore , become increasingly clear tumour identical location basic histology , response treatment differs greatly . This imply subgroup patient , equal locoregional control rate could achieve use less intense consequently less toxic treatment schedule . This contrast group patient develop locoregional recurrence follow , current treatment apparently insufficient . These patient might benefit intense treatment schedule , i.e . high dose radiation . These difference sensitivity treatment explain variation biological , molecular genetic factor . Clinical parameter alone insufficient response prediction . Identifying different molecular genetic factor , would help u increase accuracy response prediction base factor tailor treatment individually patient . Therefore want develop prognostic predictive model incorporate well-defined molecular image parameter show great promise response prediction ionize radiation . 1.2 . Genetic molecular tumour characteristic The first parameter want investigate tumour hypoxia . Hypoxia identify factor increase tumour aggressiveness decrease radiosensitivity . In past , several technique apply detect biologically relevant tumour hypoxia , none use today routine clinical practice . Recently , polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) -based hypoxia classifier gene signature publish Toustrup et al . This classifier allow u study biologically relevant tumour hypoxia consequently tumour aggressiveness resistance ionize irradiation . This analysis perform biopsy obtain prior treatment . Part biopsy material also store biobank . This facilitate future research promise molecular genetics parameter ( HPV correlate overexpression p16 example ) well-defined structured patient database . 1.3 . Imaging parameter Aside important molecular genetic tumour characteristic , several functional imaging parameter also include model . In contrast anatomical imaging , functional imaging modality provide u deep insight tumour 's underlying biological activity microstructure . Diffusion weight magnetic resonance imaging ( DWI ) characterize tissue base random displacement water proton . This displacement quantify use apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) . Preliminary study HNSCC demonstrate prognostic predictive potential repetitive DWI early treatment . Dynamic contrast enhance magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE-MRI ) second technique , show great promise early indicator response ionize radiation . Many malignant tumor manifest neovascularity angiogenesis . These process however flaw result newly synthesize vessel manifest high permeability , tortuosity generally poor functionality . This might result poor oxygen supply tumour cell , may compromise effectiveness radiation treatment tumour . Therefore vascular property tumour , assess DCE-MRI , could prove prognostic indicator aggressiveness . 2 . STUDY OBJECTIVES 2.1 . Primary objectives The main objective study correlate clinical , molecular radiological predictor outcome , define locoregional control disease free survival . In way develop prognostic/predictive model . The predictive model instrumental individualization treatment ensure optimize treatment avoid under- overtreatment . 2.2 . Secondary objective - We want get new insight tumor biology microstructure correlate image molecular/genetic marker well-defined patient population . - We want validate different image technique . - We want make correlation hypoxia predictive biomarkers future , store tissue obtain study biobank . 3 . STUDY DESIGN We propose set study prospectively include patient locally advanced head neck cancer treat concurrent chemoradiotherapy decide multidisciplinary consultation . An outline trial present figure . All patient recognize eligible ( non-metastatic locally advanced head neck squamous cell carcinoma , treat chemoradiotherapy , karnofsky performance status ≥ 70 % ≥ 18 year old ) include write informed consent . Staging laryngoscopy , CT neck , MRI neck PET-CT routinely perform . The CRT treatment consist radiotherapy 72 Gy use accelerate hyperfractionated schedule . Day 1 day 22 treatment Cisplatin 100mg/m² administer . Tumour biopsy obtain day prior treatment . The hypoxia gene expression profile derive tumour material ( 15 gene PCR analyze individually group one binary variable ) . The tissue use RNA DNA extraction need flank H &amp; E stain confirm tumor presence . From biopsy two end cut fixed paraffin . This tissue store biobank . The middle part tissue store RNA-later , use part extract DNA RNA . RNA use synthesize cDNA perform qPCR analysis hypoxic classifier . Patients also undergo DWI MRI DCE image 3 week CRT . Lesions quantitatively assess manual delineation region interest ( ROI ) tumour native DWI DCE-MRI image . ADC value ( semi- ) quantitative DCE parameter calculate respectively . All describe data integrate prognostic model together available clinical data . 4 . DEFINITION OF ENDPOINTS The main endpoint study validate describe prognostic model . Using prognostic model , predict response treatment . This help u tailor treatment individually patient .</detailed_description>
