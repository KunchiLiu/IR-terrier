	<brief_summary>To determine MRI image use determine amount iron area brain affect stroke , may help future see predict amount brain damage therefore effect patient . New research treatment use reduce amount iron build brain ; effect treatment may also see use new MRI technique .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Non-Heme Iron Load Quantification Brain MRI Patients With Hemorrhagic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hemorrhagic stroke devastate consequence . The mechanism result early delay brain injury follow hemorrhagic stroke poorly understood . One mechanism demonstrate animal study point towards deposition iron brain tissue follow hemorrhage . Preliminary data animal study also support favorable effect iron chelate agent extent neural tissue damage . preliminary human trial base hypothesis demonstrate safety escalate dos desferroxamine human population . The evaluation iron chelate agent context hemorrhagic stroke enter phase II/III trial . There modality date quantify iron tissue non invasively . Some preliminary study demonstrate role MRI identify parenchymal iron deposition traumatic brain injury . We propose validate MRI base method identify also quantify non heme iron level deposit brain tissue follow hemorrhagic stroke . Once validated method robust mechanism reliably quantify tissue iron brain closely follow iron chelate therapy trial setting .</detailed_description>
