	<brief_summary>This study test ability allogeneic cellular vaccine 1650-G vaccine enhance immune recognition tumor cell patient lung cancer . The vaccine combine oral medication call beta glucan , counter oral dietary supplement may also stimulate immune system way help body eradicate cancer cell reduce risk recurrent cancer . The primary purpose study measure change number immune cell might help low risk cancer recurrence . The investigator yet know vaccine effective fighting cancer know end study whether benefit .</brief_summary>
