	<brief_summary>This study focus implementation evidence-based HIV risk reduction intervention HIV-serodiscordant , heterosexual African American couple ( `` Eban II '' ) two geographic area ( Northern Southern California - roughly , Alameda Los Angeles Counties ) high prevalence HIV infection risk condition among African Americans . The Specific Aims follow : 1 . To evaluate implementation Eban HIV serodiscordant African American couple 10 CBOs California . To , document implementation process identify barrier facilitator Eban 's adoption use CBOs . We interview 200 staff CBOs obtain information . 2 . To evaluate effect Eban behavioral biological outcome among 180 couple , specifically incident protect sex , proportion condom use , incident sexually transmitted infection . Eban assess use randomize delayed enrollment ( waitlist ) control design evaluate impact treatment outcomes posttest 3-month follow-up ( i.e. , 10 CBOs , Eban conduct offer couple evaluate effectiveness - , well work real world . ) 3 . To determine cost-effectiveness implementation Eban , base implementation cost potential cost saving .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The HIV/AIDS epidemic continue disproportionately affect African Americans . The rate HIV among African American men six time rate White men rate among African American woman almost 15 time rate White woman . An estimated 56,300 new HIV case report 2006 , 49 % among African Americans 80 % heterosexual transmission . Sexually transmitted infection ( STIs ) also disproportionately affect African Americans , increase risk HIV transmission . Despite fact HIV STIs primarily transmit context relationship , intervention address HIV risk couple . Furthermore , evidence-based HIV prevention intervention implement community-based organization ( CBOs ) . Thus , substantial need strengthen availability use relationship orient prevention intervention community-based treatment setting . This study focus implementation evidence-based HIV risk reduction intervention HIV-serodiscordant , heterosexual African American couple ( `` Eban II '' ) two geographic area ( Northern Southern California - roughly , Alameda Los Angeles Counties ) high prevalence HIV infection risk condition among African Americans . This study build upon multi-site , NIMH-funded `` Eban '' ( Yoruba term `` fence '' ) trial , test culturally congruent intervention versus control condition among 535 heterosexual HIV serodiscordant couple four city . Couples intervention significantly reduce incident unprotected sex increase proportion condom use compare couple control condition . Statistical projection study suggest Eban participant receive intervention , six female four male would infect one year , 25 female 15 male would become HIV-infected next 5 year . Based successful outcome control trial , appropriate test effectiveness intervention deliver community-based setting . Thus , propose conduct study implementation - study method promote uptake Eban community-based organization ( CBOs ) . The Specific Aims follow : 1 . To evaluate implementation Eban HIV serodiscordant African American couple 10 CBOs California . To , document implementation process identify barrier facilitator Eban 's adoption use CBOs . We interview 200 staff CBOs obtain information . 2 . To evaluate effect Eban behavioral biological outcome among 180 couple , specifically incident protect sex , proportion condom use , incident sexually transmitted infection . Eban assess use randomize delayed enrollment ( waitlist ) control design evaluate impact treatment outcomes posttest 3-month follow-up ( i.e. , 10 CBOs , Eban conduct offer couple evaluate effectiveness - , well work real world . ) 3 . To determine cost-effectiveness implementation Eban , base implementation cost potential cost saving . So please note , essentially two level study -- first see well community agency implement take execute intervention ( thus , interviews staff ) - second , see effective Eban real world set . We know highly effective control study need test well work `` real '' world ( thus , test intervention 180 couple ) . While , also examine cost-effectiveness intervention `` real '' world setting .</detailed_description>
