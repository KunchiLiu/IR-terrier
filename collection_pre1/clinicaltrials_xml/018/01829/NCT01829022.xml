	<brief_title>Multi-center Prospective Study E-NOTES Myomectomy With Traction Multidirectional Sutures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Leiomyoma common benign tumor smooth muscle cell myometrium.1 It cause several symptom abnormal vaginal bleeding , pain , urinary symptom accord size location . Steadily , less invasive surgery prefer benign disease ( laparotomy , laparoscopy , single-port surgery ) .2,3 - However , minimal approach , laparoscopic morcellation preoperatively suspicious leimyoma , potential risk peritoneal seed postoperative diagnose leiomyosarcoma pathological examination.4 Currently , safe morcellation also require myomectomy use lesser invasive surgical approach single-port surgery natural orifice transumbilical endoscopic surgery ( NOTES ) . - During single-port surgery embryonic NOTES ( E-NOTES ) via umbilicus , handle myoma different direction could quite big challenge . Fortunately , myoma enough hard pull string tendency rupture manipulation string . - These concept lead traction anchor suture E-NOTES myomectomy apply current case . Safe morcellation could guarantee , direction morcellation via umbilicus possible endobag . - This useful safe surgical approach need confirm multi-centers term feasibility morbidity .</detailed_description>
