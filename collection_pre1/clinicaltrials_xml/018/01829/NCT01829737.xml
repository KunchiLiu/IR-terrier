	<brief_summary>Background : - Malaria illness cause parasite spread mosquito . When mosquito bite person infected kind parasite call gametocyte , able spread infection another person . Not everyone infected parasite gametocyte blood . As result , everyone spread malaria others . Researchers interested learn healthy people gametocyte blood others . Identifying people gametocyte blood help target treatment reduce spread malaria . This study focus people village Kenieroba Mali , malaria common . Objectives : - To study relationship gametocyte malaria transmission Mali . Eligibility : - Individuals 6 month 65 year age live Kenieroba , Mali , stay area 1 year . Design : - For 1 year , participant study visit every 2 week ( twice month , total 24 visit ) . The visit last 30 minute . - At visit , participant provide small blood sample . They report symptom malaria fever , headache , body ache . Participants encourage seek medical treatment experience malaria symptom visit . - Participants malaria symptom blood test malaria parasite . Those parasite blood receive antimalarial treatment . - Three time 1 year , large blood sample collect . These blood sample take dry season , wet season , next dry season . - Women 14 45 year age also provide urine sample test pregnancy . Pregnant woman ask give blood sample .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Plasmodium falciparum malaria continue evade control effort part complexity life cycle , involve human mosquito . While know gametocyte form parasite transmits disease , unclear individual constitute primary gametocyte reservoir give human population . It also unclear individual asexual parasite density , acquire immune response , red blood cell ( RBC ) polymorphisms affect presence transmission gametocyte . Investigating effect limited part gametocyte often present peripheral blood density limit microscopic detection . Recent technical advance molecular detection gametocyte set stage well understanding gametocyte epidemiology biology human . In set highly seasonal transmission , conduct epidemiological study estimate gametocyte prevalence 1 year village Kenieroba , Mali . In cohort 500 individual represent age-distribution entire village population , explore age , asexual parasite prevalence , season , RBC polymorphisms affect variation gametocyte prevalence ( detect sensitive molecular method ) . From individual , purify plasma IgG compare transmission-blocking activity age group season . These assessment provide foundation future study gametocytemia dynamic within individual well impact host immunity gametocyte infectivity study population . Such information enable u identify individual primarily responsible malaria transmission Kenieroba . Incorporation find new exist computer-based model parasite infection transmission may improve evaluation exist malaria control strategy .</detailed_description>
