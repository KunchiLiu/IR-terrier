	<brief_title>RAL+ATV/r Comparison With TDF/FTC ( 3TC ) +ATV/r HIV Infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Overall Study Design Plan : Description This pilot , randomize , open-label study . All participant assign receive RAL+ATV/r TDF/FTC+ATV/r . Patients evaluate screening , randomization ( day 0 ) , week 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 36 48 . At screen visit , subject must willing able give write ( sign date ) inform consent prior study specific procedure . They receive unique screen number undergo study procedure associate screen visit . The investigator evaluate whether subject meet eligibility criterion specify record detail inform consent process result assessment subject 's medical record . Two form ICF sign , one subject file site . At baseline visit , enrollment criterion review subject meet undergo study procedure . Subjects receive instruction study medication dose schedule . Subjects start study medication within 24 hour baseline visit . Subjects return investigator´s site study visit procedure . Subjects prematurely discontinue study must return discontinuation visit undergo study procedure identify discontinuation visit .</detailed_description>
