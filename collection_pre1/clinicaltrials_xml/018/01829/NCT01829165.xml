	<brief_summary>The overarch goal research program elucidate causal directional neural network- level abnormality depression , modulate individually-tailored , circuit-directed intervention . By use concurrent TMS fMRI , investigator overcome major limitation neuroimaging - inability demonstrate causality . The investigator ' finding serve platform future study wherein TMS treatment directly guide investigator ' ability image causally manipulate specific neural network . Aim 1 : To examine causal interaction two major brain network depression . Aim 2 : To examine impact antidepressant TMS causal network abnormality depression . Hypothesis 1 : Depressed subject show blunted response , compare healthy control , two target interact network , use concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . Hypothesis 2 : Treatment patient high-frequency repetitive TMS ( rTMS ) result normalization baseline network-level deficit , predict degree baseline network abnormality .</brief_summary>
