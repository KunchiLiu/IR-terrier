	<brief_summary>Background : - Two way study brain people move near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) electroencephalography ( EEG ) . NIRS us light look blood flow brain active . EEG record electrical activity brain . Both use safely many year , even young child . NIRS EEG use person move show part brain active . Researchers want use NIRS EEG study brain activity movement people cerebral palsy healthy volunteer . Learning people without cerebral palsy use brain control muscle may lead new way train people cerebral palsy move well . Objectives : - To study brain control body movement people without cerebral palsy . Eligibility : - Individuals least 5 year age cerebral palsy . - Healthy volunteer least 5 year age . Design : - This study three part . People cerebral palsy select three . Healthy volunteer ask two . Everyone participate NIRS and/or EEG exams movement . People cerebral palsy may also biofeedback session train coordination movement brain activity . - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Urine sample may collect . - All participant least one session NIRS and/or EEG imaging study . Sessions may also include follow test : - Magnetic resonance image look brain - Electromyography measure electrical activity muscle - Motion analysis specific body part - Ultrasound measure activity muscle - Motorized , robotic , electrical stimulation muscle - Other clinical test muscle movement need . - Participants cerebral palsy biofeedback session . These session help learn coordinate muscle movement brain activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Neural image functional task become portable accessible magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) utilize non-invasive near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) mean isolate area brain activity measure blood flow dynamic electroencephalography ( EEG ) measure electrical activity cortical surface . Although use technology assess cortical activation pattern increase , validation approach , particularly child brain injury cerebral palsy , early stage report literature . The use motor training paradigm rehabilitation population yet report . The objective protocol : 1 ) systematically compare cortical activation pattern associate specified motor sensory task healthy child adults unilateral bilateral childhood-onset brain injury ; 2 ) extend use EEG laboratory across subject group task , use alone NIRS ; 3 ) pilot use NIRS and/ EEG brain biofeedback device child childhood-onset brain injury . The first two objective observational , third objective include pilot intervention . The result study expected increase knowledge brain activation pattern across task group without brain injury provide proof concept power estimate future clinical study technology . A secondary question would like examine image technology potential effect motor impairment result childhood-onset peripheral injury ( e.g . obstetrical brachial plexus palsy ) brain reorganization . Study population : The childhood-onset brain injury group consist to120 individual ( 5 year ) span three objective . The childhood-onset peripheral injury group consist 100 individual within age-range span Objectives 1 2 . The control group participant cohort consist 50 individual span Objectives 1 2 , total recruitment 100 healthy volunteer within age range . Design : Objective 1 , primary focus research protocol , cross-sectional analysis multiple task across subject group . Objective 2 primarily descriptive study , Objective 3 pilot evaluation effectiveness novel short term motor train program child childhood-onset brain injury target improve brain activation pattern motor performance . Outcome measure : Objective 1 primary quantitative objective protocol , compare location , magnitude , volume area cortical activation across task group . Secondary outcome include descriptive measure use primarily evaluate two technique monitor motion muscle activation ( EMG ultrasound ) data help interpret task group difference . Objective 3 measure change brain activation motor performance childhood-onset brain injury short training program .</detailed_description>
