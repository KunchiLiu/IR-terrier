	<detailed_description>PURPOSE OF STUDY The patient understand cancer breast . The patient understand offer opportunity participate registry study collect data FDA approve device , Partial Breast Brachytherapy Applicator . Partial Breast Brachytherapy treatment method work deliver radiation inside breast directly tissue cancer likely recur . The Partial Breast Brachytherapy Applicator device tiny catheter wire fit inside lumpectomy cavity ( space leave tumor remove ) . Radioactive source ( seed ) place within device computer control machine . This radioactive source deliver radiation therapy breast A registry observation database . Participation registry require additional different procedure drug would normally receive breast cancer . Registry databases use identify trend medical care help medical community identify optimal care different disease . PROCEDURES If patient agree take part registry , data compile safety performance Partial Breast Brachytherapy Applicator base information collect treatment follow visit . POTENTIAL RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS There medical risk patient take part registry , continue receive medical care provide medical team . POTENTIAL BENEFITS : It possible state patient benefit study . The information obtain study may use scientifically may possibly helpful others . ALTERNATIVES TO TREATMENT The patient participation voluntary may choose participate study may stop time . The patient choice affect doctor provide care . The patient lose benefit choose participate withdraw study . She free seek care doctor choice time .</detailed_description>
