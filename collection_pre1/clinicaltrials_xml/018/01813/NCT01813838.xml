	<detailed_description>Primary objective Phase I : To determine maximal tolerate dose ( MTD ) dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) increase dos IV Acadesine administer D1 , D3 , D5 , D8 , D10 D12 28 56 day-courses Phase II : To confirm safety hematological toxicity 18 additional patient Secondary objective : Phase I : - To determine response rate , defined 2006 modify IWG criterion , - To evaluate response duration , time IPSS progression , loss RBC transfusion independence patient . - To evaluate hospitalization duration , rate rehospitalization non-hematological toxicity , severe bleed febrile neutropenia . Phase II : To determine - response rate define 2006 modify IWG criterion - toxicity profile safety - response duration - rate progression AML - overall survival</detailed_description>
