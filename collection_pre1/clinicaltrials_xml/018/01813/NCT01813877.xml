	<brief_title>Response Monitoring Trial Patients With Suspected Recurrence Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant glioma aggressive primary brain tumor almost always lead rapid patient deterioration death . Timely diagnosis recurrent disease well accurate monitoring therapeutic response critically important glioblastoma patient . Despite introduction new treatment approach patient prognosis poor less half patient progression-free first 6 month diagnosis disease recurrence ( 6-month-progression-free survival rate 46 % ) . The current diagnostic standard care diagnose monitoring brain tumor contrast-enhanced , multi-planar magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . However , ability MRI early detection disease recurrence progression limit . Moreover , determination treatment responses difficult since benign tissue change radiation and/or chemotherapy appearance tumor recurrence progression MRI . Positron emission tomography ( PET ) establish image technique utilizes small amount radioactivity attach minimal amount substance ( tracer ) inject via hand arm vein . These substance track certain feature cancer visualize use PET/CT scanner . For instance , number different PET-tracers use study brain tumor metabolism detect primary recurrent tumor . These include tracer glucose ( 18F-FDG ) amino acid metabolism ( e.g . 18F-DOPA ) . Metabolic image brain tumor amino acid analogue advantage 18F-FDG . Since FDG ass glucose metabolism normal brain consumes lot glucose difficult detect tumor high glucose use normal brain tissue . 18FDOPA successfully use clinically many year . The advantage 18F-DOPA normal brain tissue consume little 18F-DOPA . Thus , tumor see easily low background activity . 18F-DOPA PET imaging detects brain tumor high accuracy 18F-DOPA imaging affect management 40 % patient . However , impact patient outcome define survival , cost , and/or quality life demonstrate . Randomized trial need evaluate impact PET patient management outcome . We determine randomize patient suspect recurrence glioblastoma manage use conventional diagnostic image versus receive conventional image plus 18F-DOPA PET . Randomization like flip coin . Patients 50 % chance undergo standard image standard imaging combine 18F-DOPA PET . Approximately 25-40 % patient suspected tumor recurrence pseudo-progression MRI ( i.e . image suggest tumor recurrence fact recurrence ) . These patient correctly negative 18F-DOPA PET scan . In patient initiation treatment postpone . In contrast , patient positive 18F-DOPA PET scan undergo kind treatment discretion treat physician ( radiation therapy , chemotherapy surgery ) . We find whether management treatment change base 18FDOPA PET affect survival patient affect cost care patient .</detailed_description>
