	<detailed_description>Heart Failure ( HF ) represent one major social health problem , high prevalence huge economic impact , well elevate morbidity mortality associate . In Spain , estimate prevalence 7 % 45 year old , increase 18 % 75 year old . Currently , HF lead cause hospital admission 65 year mortality patient symptomatic HF remain bad majority cancer . The estimated minimum expenditure 1.1 % total health care cost 2 % specialized medical care . This account staggeringly large financial burden health care system . Chronic HF complex disease , whose progression involve multiple pathophysiological system . It well establish deleterious effect activation renin-angiotensin-aldosterone sympathetic nervous system . The blockage system beta-blockers , angiotensin convert enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitor , angiotensin-receptor blocker ( ARBs ) aldosterone antagonists improved prognosis . However , spite therapy , prognosis patient chronic HF remain poor . During HF progression advance stage , show anabolic metabolic deterioration , result predominance catabolic process . The deficiency anabolic hormone correlate great severity symptom , activation neuroendocrine inflammatory system , insulin resistance , metabolic impairment , exercise intolerance , anemia cardiac cachexia . All process take part final progression HF disease death , HF become systemic disease . In men HF , level testosterone ( main anabolic hormone ) decrease ; fact , 30 % men level 10th percentile reference healthy population adjust age . The deterioration anabolic hormone correlate inversely severity HF disease determine high mortality . In fact , low testosterone level associate reduced cardiac output , great symptomatic limitation high mortality . Therefore , testosterone deficiency men HF detrimental impact symptom prognosis . In addition , testosterone show beneficial effect HF patient , vasodilatation coronary peripheral artery , inotropic effect , reduction neurohormonal activation , anti-inflammatory immunomodulatory action , reduction cytokine production improvement muscle strength . All action potential benefit patient HF , involve progression disease , especially advanced stage . The rational approach `` testosterone replacement improve prognosis patient advance HF testosterone deficiency '' strong pathophysiological plausibility . To date , clinical trial evaluate effect testosterone replacement morbidity mortality . However , last year , numerous editorial lead journal conclude need clarify effect testosterone therapy cardiac function morbimortality patient advance HF . Our group work last year field , confirm presence testosterone deficiency men chronic HF , associate bad prognosis great decline exercise capacity . Therefore , investigator propose clinical trial morbimortality population advance heart failure associate deficiency testosterone ; , previous background justifies potential benefit testosterone replacement therapy . In addition , large clinical impact disease support priority need independent study .</detailed_description>
