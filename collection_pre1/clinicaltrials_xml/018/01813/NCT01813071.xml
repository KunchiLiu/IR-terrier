	<detailed_description>This single site , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , dose-escalation , age-descending study start test vaccine healthy adult move subsequently school-age child . The study design 2 part , part comprise 3 cohort . The cohort receive low dose Parts A B receive one administration vaccine placebo ; subsequent two high dose cohort Parts A B receive three administration vaccine placebo . In cohort , first dose immediate safety evaluation conduct icddr , b Inpatient Unit , participant admit observation 72 hour . Follow-up visit participant A1 B1 take place outpatient basis Mirpur Field Office . Second third vaccination within A2 , A3 , B2 , B3 cohorts follow-up visit take place outpatient basis Mirpur Field Office . Before enrol participant subsequent cohort receive high vaccine dose , move low age group , safety data previous cohort ( ) ( Study Day 7 ) evaluate review Internal Protocol Safety Team ( IPST ) comprise study physician , Medical Monitor GVK , principal investigator , Medical Monitor PVS . Upon completion last adult cohort , ( DSMB -an advisory body Ethical Review Committee ) convene review cumulative safety data IPST recommendation , determine whether proceed Part B ( child ) . Adverse event ( AE ) grade accord standardize criterion . The immunogenicity outcome measure interest include serum IgG IgA antibodies Antibodies Lymphocyte Supernatant ( ALS ) assay S. sonnei2a LPS , shed profile WRSS1 , vaccine-specific mucosal IgA responses . The propose study build upon successful preliminary observation vaccine US , Israel Thailand . While secondary objective include study immunogenicity WRSS1 vaccine , primary goal current trial establish clear safety profile WRSS1 vaccine adult child 5-9 year old.The primary objective study evaluate safety tolerability vaccine ; secondary objective evaluate vaccine immunogenicity .</detailed_description>
