	<brief_title>In Vivo Drug Interaction Pharmacokinetic Study Tenofovir 1 % Gel Three Commonly Used Vaginal Products</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consist three separate crossover study , evaluate local release characteristic systemic exposure TFV 1 % gel give vaginal product impact concomitant use . Vaginal product assess : antifungal cream , antimicrobial gel , combination contraceptive vaginal ring ( IVR ) . There comparison vaginal product group . Participants randomize vaginal product . Participants cream gel cohort randomize order treatment condition ( TFV gel alone , vaginal product alone , TFV gel vaginal product concomitantly ) . Participants IVR cohort use TFV gel alone first crossover period ; order remain treatment condition ( IVR alone , TFV IVR concomitantly ) crossover period 2 3 randomly assign . Each participant attend total least 7 visit . At first visit , volunteer consent undergo procedure ass whether eligible continue study . If eligible , undergo 3 crossover treatment period . Within crossover treatment period 2 visit , schedule occur within menstrual cycle ; first visit follicular phase menstrual cycle product use initiated cycle day 9 18 second visit cycle day 16 24 . At start crossover period 1 , confirm participant meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion , randomize vaginal product cohort sequence treatment condition 3 crossover period . Crossover periods 2 3 schedule subsequent menstrual cycle , first visit crossover period occur approximately 2 week completion previous crossover period . Product usage 3 crossover period follow : - Treatment Condition ( vaginal product alone ) : The participant instruct use assign product 5 21 day , depend dose instruction particular product cohort assign . The second visit crossover period occur product use complete . For participant use antifungal cream antimicrobial gel , blood specimen collect approximately 6 hour last gel cream use . In IVR cohort , blood specimen collect 21 day use 0/4 , 6 , 10 , 24 hour . The 0/4 hour collection time point time first plasma draw . It mean mimic 4 hour post-TFV gel insertion collection time point describe TFV gel alone vaginal product/TFV gel treatment condition . No biopsy collect vaginal product treatment condition cohort . - Treatment Condition ( TFV gel alone ) : The participant instruct use TFV gel 7 day , inserted twice day dose approximately 12 hour apart . The second visit crossover period occur product use complete . Blood specimen collect approximately 4 hour last dose TFV gel . In IVR cohort , participant blood specimen collect 4 , 6 , 10 24 hour last dose TFV gel . Vaginal biopsy schedule take place approximately 6 hour last dose TFV gel cohort . - Treatment Condition ( vaginal product TFV gel ) : The participant instruct use assign product 5 21 day , depend dose instruction particular product cohort assign . TFV gel use 7 day , inserted twice day dose approximately 12 hour apart ; morning insertion TFV gel occur approximately two hour insertion vaginal product ( gel cream cohort ) . The second visit crossover period occur product use complete . In gel cream cohort , blood specimen collect approximately 4 hour last TFV gel use . In IVR cohort , blood specimen collect 4 , 6 , 10 24 hour last dose TFV gel . Vaginal biopsy schedule take place approximately 6 hour last dose TFV gel cohort . Each participant contact phone approximately 1-2 week completion crossover period 3 confirm additional adverse experience . If necessary , may see unscheduled visit follow-up . She exit study .</detailed_description>
