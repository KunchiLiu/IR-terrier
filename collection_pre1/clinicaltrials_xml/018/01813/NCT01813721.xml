	<brief_summary>This prospective observational study investigate physician assess risk febrile neutropenia ( FN ) develop patient receive chemotherapy . Approximately 150-200 investigator take part 100 site Europe , Canada Australia . Approximately 1000 subject study , non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) , non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) breast cancer due receive one specific chemotherapy regimens interest . Investigators ' approach FN risk assessment study use list possible risk factor may consider assessment . Investigators ask select rank factor consider important assess overall FN risk subject make decision whether treat granulocyte-colony stimulating factor ( G-CSF ) primary prophylaxis ( PP ) . They ask make selection base initially routine clinical practise subsequently relate specifically subject recruit . This non-interventional study involve procedure outside normal care subject ; data collection complete prior chemotherapy administration .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Although formal hypothesis test observational study , hypothesize clinical risk factor rank important conducting FN risk assessment investigator align international guideline publish data . Also , investigator 's decision treat G-CSF PP influence clinical non-clinical risk factor ( distance site , estimate subject compliance , access fully reimburse G-CSF ) . Study Design : Prior identify eligible subject , Investigators register record baseline information . During Baseline Investigator Assessment investigator provide two list risk factor . Investigators must rank select risk factor consider important assess 1 ) overall FN risk ( scientific factor include ) , 2 ) decide whether G-CSF PP treatment use ( list also contain non clinical factor ) . They also record FN risk intervention threshold , FN risk threshold score would use G-CSF PP usual clinical practice . Investigators prospectively sequentially identify eligible subject NHL , breast lung cancer due initiate one permitted standard dose chemotherapy regimen list protocol . The permitted chemotherapy regimen estimate intermediate FN risk ( 10 % -20 % ) document publish data and/or international guideline . For enrolled subject , Investigators complete Subject Assessment prior start chemotherapy . They provide two list risk factor Baseline Assessment ask complete base specific subject . Investigators must rank select risk factor consider important assess 1 ) overall FN risk ( scientific factor include ) , 2 ) decide whether G-CSF PP treatment use . They also document final estimate FN risk score percentage base subject 's medical history standard care ( SOC ) assessment ( routine practice assess risk ) , decision whether G-CSF PP administer . Investigators record type G-CSF plan use one use . End Study subject occur activity complete , prescription first cycle chemotherapy write . The subject data collect historical subject information laboratory data SOC assessment perform prior begin chemotherapy treatment . No data collect initiation chemotherapy . The approach statistical analysis generally descriptive nature . The primary analysis conduct two level ; investigator level subject level . It expect opinion investigator single site ( , department within cancer treatment centre ) correlate . Also , opinion subject single investigator alike subject investigator ; adjustment make analysis account . Confidence interval investigator level analysis subject level data obtain Multi-level Modelling ( MLM ) allow expect intra-site intra-investigator correlation investigator within site subject within investigator . In general , categorical data summarise number percentage subject category . Continuous data summarise mean , standard deviation , median , low upper quartile , minimum maximum value . Two-sided exact 95 % confidence interval ( obtain use MLM ) present , appropriate .</detailed_description>
