	<brief_summary>Sedentary behavior protein-energy wasting ( PEW ) well know risk factor adverse outcome low quality life chronic renal failure patient treated dialysis . Treatment strategies PEW different type nutritional support ( dietary counseling , oral nutritional supplement intradialytic parenteral nutrition ) limit efficacy . Physical activity show numerous positive impact pathologic condition associated end stage renal disease . Concomitant prescription physical activity nutritional support might mutually enhance anabolic effect intervention improve rate remission PEW . The aim study analyze effect program , progressive endurance training perform dialysis session cycle ergometer supervision qualify trainer , protein energy waste physical functioning chronic hemodialysis patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim 1 : To determine percentage patient remission state protein- energy wasting . Hypothesis 1 : Patients exercise group frequently reverse PEW control group Aim 2 : To determine pattern change body composition ( fat free mass ) . Hypothesis 2 : Patients exercise group maintain increase fat free mass patient control group decrease fat free mass Aim 3 : To determine effect exercise muscle strength . Hypothesis 3 : Patients exercise group maintain increase quadriceps strength patient control group decrease muscle strength Aim 4 : To determine effect exercise postural balance . Hypothesis 4 : Patients exercise group maintain increase body balance patient control group decrease body balance Aim 5 : To determine effect exercise quality life assess SF-36 . Hypothesis 5 : Patients exercise group maintain increase quality life form patient control group decrease quality life</detailed_description>
