	<brief_summary>Although infection hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) result acute hepatitis ; commonly progress chronic hepatitis . The acute process often asymptomatic . Acute HCV typically lead chronic infection . Chronic HCV infection usually slowly progressive . Approximately 5 20 percent chronically infected individual develop cirrhosis 20-30 year period time . Chronic HCV common cause chronic liver disease , cirrhosis , hepatocellular carcinoma , frequent indication liver transplantation United States . Screening chronic HCV infection crucial chronic HCV infection often asymptomatic , effective treatment available , untreated disease carry high risk morbidity mortality . Expert opinion , recommendation , guideline HCV screen agree . All guideline recommend screen patient increase risk HCV ( ie : typical risk factor ) . In 2012 , Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) recommend screen person born 1945 1965 . At least two study suggest screen person born 1945 1964 1946 1970 , respectively , cost-effective . The study estimate patient find HCV positive treat pegylated interferon , ribavirin , direct act antiviral therapy ( patient HCV genotype 1 ) , would cost $ 35,700 37,700 per quality adjust life-year . Screening base upon birth cohort patient without risk factor may lead false positive result . Currently 1 % patient birth cohort 1945-1965 care Intermountain Healthcare provider screen . Ambulatory care physician effectively screen patient . It unclear whether screen base risk factor alone versus screen base upon risk factor birth cohort effectively manage burden chronic HCV infection patient manage Intermountain Healthcare provider . It possible Intermountain Healthcare population differs risk U.S. population , make guideline application less certain . A well-designed prospective cohort study need understand risk benefit different HCV screening strategy diagnostic yield clinical outcome . The investigator hypothesize screen base person 's history risk factor detect chronic HCV infection 2.7 % population test ; would accord national average . The investigator hypothesize screen base birth cohort risk factor identify roughly percentage test population . The investigator anticipate usable data within three month give u data describe publish effectiveness different screening strategy . The investigator identify patient chronic HCV infection initial study require treatment management . The investigator believe group could follow inexpensively clinical endpoint many year . This would definitively define effectiveness screen strategy base good evidence . No study evaluate clinical outcome associate different screen strategy chronic hepatitis c virus infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Cohort Study : To Provide Evidence &amp; Guidance Hepatitis C Virus Screening , Comparing New Birth Cohort Recommendations From CDC , Versus Classical Traditional Strategies With Established Risk Factors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A . SPECIFIC AIMS ( limit one page ) 1 . Compare yield risk base versus risk base birth cohort screen hepatitis C virus function number invite screen . The control group receive routine care deliver normally local medical practice . This conducted Salt Lake Area . 2 . Determine cost arm hepatitis C virus screen strategy . 3 . Assess patient history unknown risk factor infection HCV . 4 . Create registry HCV positive HCV negative patient follow future study determine long term outcome . Outcome Measures : 1 . Rate positive screening HCV group function number invite screen . 2 . Rate persistent HCV infection screen-positive patient base confirmatory test . 3 . Determine percentage Utah population test positive HCV compare national average . 4 . Listing risk factor patient analysis risk factor tool discover new risk factor cause . B . BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE ( Limit two page ) There much publish regard recommendation screen patient HCV . Much attention due new treatment . Specific antiviral treatment genotype 1 HCV receive much attention . The report sustained viral response HCV genotype 1 new agent impressive currently great expense ( 12 ) . With new advance become paramount identify patient early avoid great morbidity early mortality . There also disparate recommendation screen HCV Centers Disease Control Prevention United States Preventive Task Force . The American Association Study Liver Diseases side CDC . The CDC new birth cohort recommendation addition risk factor screen versus USPTF recommendation screen base upon risk factor . Given conflict guideline , tailor evidence provide guidance Intermountain clinician would useful ; especially Intermountain population may differ U.S. population risk make application national guideline uncertain . This study delineate effective screen approach population serve , identify rate false positive test , delineate cost screen strategy recommend . Currently one percent patient birth cohort 1945-1965 care Intermountain Healthcare provider screen . Ambulatory practitioner effectively screen patient may believe patient sufficient risk merit screen . It unclear whether screen base risk factor alone , screen base upon risk factor birth cohort recommendation effectively manage burden chronic HCV infection patient manage Intermountain Healthcare provider . A well-designed prospective cohort study need understand risk benefit different HCV screening strategy diagnostic yield clinical outcome ( 9 ) . We hypothesize screen base establish risk factor detect HCV 2.7 % population test . We believe add propose birth cohort addition risk factor screen increase number identify chronic HCV . Once generated registry patient Initial study believe group could follow inexpensively clinical endpoint many year come . We would group newly diagnose chronically infected patient HCV , identify CDC USPTF guideline . We could ensure evidence base HCV treatment follow endpoint chronic liver disease complication . We would able know screen hepatitis C virus beneficial patient care cost effective . We 885,000 patient intermountain healthcare born 1945 1965 . Only one percent screen HCV . In screened 11 % positive HCV test . The national average 2.7 percent . This base upon clear screen program . We appear screen hepatitis C well national average . The state Utah Epidemilogist 's data indicate 1 % Utahns hepatitis C. If test per CDC recommendation would expect diagnose 20,000 additional patient HCV . If individual screen tested positively receive liver biopsy treatment could expect cost system close 3 billion dollar . In summary , likely many people chronic HCV identify treat . In study , determine effectiveness screen strategy . This inform clinicians screen know screen chronic HCV base evidence recommendation . Further follow newly diagnose patient determine screen effective follow evidence base management . We also able measure cost oppose calculation base quality life year . C. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND METHODS ( Limit five page ) We identify 9 internal medicine office Salt Lake area . We divide clinic three group ( three clinic per group ) . We currently perform prestratification group make sure n't age , sex , racial divergency . Group 1 would control group . The provider facility perform hepatitis C virus screen would normally . Group 2 would provide risk factor screen per USPTF guide line . Group 3 would use CDC 's recent birth cohort recommendation addition risk factor screen . The exclusion criterion patient test positive hepatitis C virus give positive history regard infection . We would like identify 2000 patient strategy 3 month . We would ask office manager physicians clinic let office staff give screen strategy form patient ask part study . We create sheet patient complete wait appointment . The clinical staff would ask interpret order appropriate testing . We place strategy one side sheet paper give internal medicine patient age 18 75 . I enlist help Dr. Greg Elliott , Scott Stevens , Scott Woller others steer committee offer expert advice guidance . Strategies : 1 . Screen hepatitis C per regular practice occur clinic currently . 1 . Form would ask ever test Hepatitis C. 2 . The rest screening would leave provider 's discretion . 2 . Screen hepatitis C per conventional risk factor : . A sheet risk factor provide . Those history illicit injection drug use intranasal cocaine use , even use ii . Those received clotting factor make 1987 iii . Those received blood/organs July 1992 iv . Those informed receive blood donor later test positive HCV v. Those ever chronic hemodialysis vi . Those evidence liver disease ( persistently elevate alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] level ) vii . Those infected HIV viii . Children born HCV-infected mother . ix . Those needle stick injury mucosal exposure HCV-positive blood x . Those current sexual partner HCV-infected person xi . Incarcerated individual xii . Healthcare , emergency , public safety worker needle stick/mucosal exposure HCV-positive blood xiii . Children born HCV-positive woman xiv . Are spouse household contact HCV-infected patient Those risk factor test HCV , HBV , HIV Investigative factor : - Recipients transplant tissue 1992 - Those history tattoo , body pierce - Those history sexually transmit disease multiple sex partner - Long-term steady sexual partner HCV-positive person Any exposure concern : ______________________________ . 3 . Screen hepatitis C conventional risk factor new CDC birth cohort recommendation . 1 . Anyone born United States 1945 1965 2 . Those history illicit injection drug use intranasal cocaine use , even use 3 . Those received clotting factor make 1987 4 . Those received blood/organs July 1992 5 . Those informed receive blood donor later test positive HCV 6 . Those ever chronic hemodialysis 7 . Those evidence liver disease ( persistently elevate alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] level ) 8 . Those infected HIV 9 . Children born HCV-infected mother . 10 . Those needle stick injury mucosal exposure HCV-positive blood 11 . Those current sexual partner HCV-infected person 12 . Incarcerated individual 13 . Healthcare , emergency , public safety worker needle stick/mucosal exposure HCV-positive blood 14 . Children born HCV-positive woman 15 . Are spouse household contact HCV-infected patient Investigative risk factor : - Recipients transplant tissue 1992 - Those history tattoo , body pierce - Those history sexually transmit disease multiple sex partner - Long-term steady sexual partner HCV-positive person Any exposure concern : ______________________________ . Guidance initial positive HCV screen : All patient test HCV , HBV , HIV risk factor . If patient find Hepatitis C positive EIA , HCV RNA quantity ( viral load ) would perform . If HCV RNA negative EIA + , order HCV RIBA . ( PCR ) ; RIBA negative indicates false positive EIA test . Those patient positive result would notify primary physician . We would provide decision tree work treatment newly find infection . Patients referred gastroenterologist , hepatologists , primary care provider treat chronic hepatitis C virus infection . F. IMPACT ( Limit one page ) Hepatitis C virus lead cause chronic liver disease United States , lead reason liver transplantation . Recent advance , treatment , make Hepatitis C virus chronic infection curable many patient . It important identify , treat , attempt cure patient , many n't know affected . Recommendations make try accomplish . There need evidence guide screen therapy . With study could provide evidence Intermountain , Utah , I believe great medical community . In month could data publishable compare screening recommendation HCV . We would know screen strategy superior identify chronic HCV . We would follow study , hopefully additional funding outside group , identify new carrier chronic Hepatitis C. We would provide current evidence base antiviral treatment available base genotype . This would allow u see comparative progression liver disease subsequent complication three screen group . We could follow group 20 year evidence would guide screen treatment HCV .</detailed_description>
