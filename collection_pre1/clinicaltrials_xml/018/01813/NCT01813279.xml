	<brief_summary>Systemic sclerosis autoimmune disease characterize skin lesion visceral responsible significant morbidity . Microcirculatory disorder tissue fibrosis excessive severity disease . This condition affect hand major functional consequence severely impair quality life patient . Adipose tissue use plastic surgery century fill depression skin . In addition volume effect , trophic effect surround tissue note . It show stromal vascular fraction responsible regenerative effect . In previous study investigator demonstrate mouse model subcutaneous adipose tissue provide trophic effect SSc skin lesion reduce fibrosis dermis provide pro angiogenic . Objectives mean : This clinical study evaluate innovative cell therapy procedure . The objective study evaluate effect injection autologous stromal vascular fraction adipose origin accord system Celution ® ( Cytori Therapeutics , Inc.. , United Kingdom ) digital patient scleroderma cutaneous hand . Eleven patient scleroderma hand include study . Due nature orphan disease , longitudinal study conduct , patient control . The evaluation pre post operative period six month . This evaluation base clinical criterion ( trophic balance , functional ) laboratory ( capillaroscopy , Doppler ultrasound artery forearm , laser-Doppler tissue ) . Project schedule implementation phase : The project run period twelve month . Patients follow period six month . Analyzes clinical , paraclinical , exploitation result achieve period six month . Expected Results : This study validate functional trophic effect reinjection autologous stromal vascular fraction adipose tissue issue finger patient scleroderma . Conclusion : This innovative cell therapy could represent alternative treatment patient scleroderma check , intolerant insufficiently relieve medical treatment currently available scleroderma hand</brief_summary>
