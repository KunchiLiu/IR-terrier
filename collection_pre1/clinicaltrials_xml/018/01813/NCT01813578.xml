	<brief_summary>The hypothesis intensive aerobic endurance muscle training safe beneficial patient systemic sclerosis concurrent interstitial lung disease . The purpose study examine effect eight week intensive aerobic exercise muscle endurance train program patient systemic sclerosis 50-100 % forced vital capacity . A single subject experimental design repeat systematic measure six week A-phase ( baseline period ) eight week B-phase ( intervention period ) use . Physical capacity ( six minute walk test ) , aerobic capacity ( submaximal treadmill test ) muscle endurance shoulder hip flexion ( Functional Index 2 ) assess every week throughout 14 week study . Activity limitation ( Health Assessment Questionnaire ) , quality life ( Short Form 36 ) , Raynaud , Fatigue Global Health recent week ( Visual Analogue Scales ) assess week 0 , 6 , 14 . The exercise program include aerobic exercise correspond 15 Borg RPE scale ( strenuous ) muscular endurance training three times/week .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study examine effect eight week intensive aerobic exercise muscle endurance train program patient systemic sclerosis 50-100 % forced vital capacity . As systemic sclerosis rare condition Single Subject Experimental Design ( SSED ) use include 6-week non-interventional A-phase patient assess systematically follow 8-week interventional B-phase patient exercise three day week continue systematic assessment . According 2-standard deviation ( 2 SD ) band analysis , statistical analysis perform patient individually . Accordingly , statistically significant change detect two consecutive assessment B-phase exceed 2 standard deviation ( SD ) mean A-phase . Patients recruit ongoing study Karolinska University Hospital purpose screen patient systemic sclerosis Stockholm cardiovascular disease . All patient meet inclusion criterion invite participate exercise study . Assessments : The six minute walk test use assess physical capacity . A submaximal treadmill test use estimate oxygen uptake ml/kg x min . Muscle endurance assess Functional Index 2 register number correct perform repetition 7 muscle group . Pain , Raynaud 's Phenomenon , fatigue global disease impact general well-being assess Visual Analogue scale ( VAS ) , 0-100 . Limitations activity daily live assess use Health Assessment Questionnaire SF-36 include assess perceive health . The Exercise program : The program start 10-minute warm-up session biking intensity correspond perceive light exertion ( 10 Borg RPE , 6-20 scale ) . Thereafter , load increase reach intensity correspond perceive heavy exertion ( 15 Borg RPE scale ) additional 15 minute . During last five minute bike session , load reduced intensity correspond light exertion . Heart rate record pulse watch ( RS100 Polar ) peripheral saturation record heart rate oximeter ( Wristox 3100 Nonin Medical ) . During first week patient start low lead increase goal intensity . After bike exercise , participant perform repetitive dynamic muscle resistance training goal achieve many repetition possible shoulder flexion hip flexion .</detailed_description>
