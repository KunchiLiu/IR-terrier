	<brief_title>Phase II Study Optimal Scheme Administration Pazopanib Thyroid Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total near-total thyroidectomy primary treatment differentiate thyroid carcinoma . Postoperatively , DTC treat radioiodine ( 131I ) thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) suppressive levothyroxine therapy . But 5 % 20 % patient DTC develop distant metastasis ; become refractory 131I therapy . Targeted therapy study iodine refractory DTC several year none treatments yet approve DTC clinician continue enroll patient clinical trial . The agent use far thyroid cancer small molecule share property inhibit various tyrosine kinase receptor Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor ( VEGFR ) , Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) , RET c-met . The VEGF ( Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor ) one several pro angiogenic molecule play pivotal role angiogenesis , one mechanism involve tumor growth dissemination . VEGF expression highly prevalent Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma ( PTCs ) ( 79 % ) , Follicular Thyroid Carcinoma ( FTCs ) ( 50 % ) Poorly Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma ( PDTCs ) ( 37 % ) VEGFR respectively express 76 % , 83 % 25 % VEGRF-1 68 % , 56 % 37 % VEGRF-2 . Pazopanib ( GW786034 - GlaxoSmithKline ) orally administer , potent multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor VEGFR particular ( also PDGFR-α -β , stem cell factor receptor c-Kit ) . The result obtain metastatic locally advanced refractory DTC currently available ( phase II study 39 patient metastatic , rapidly progressive RAI-refractory DTC , treat pazopanib 800mg daily , publish Lancet Oncology 2010 KC Bible ) , demonstrate efficacy therapy indication . However , clear data yet available indicate optimal duration treatment first line therapy : patient currently treat progression drug discontinuation due toxicity . Indeed , patient may difficulties manage chronic mild moderate ( grade 1-2 ) side-effects related long-term treatment , lead asymptomatic patient tumor control TKI treatment ask treatment interruption . The intermittent administration avoid occurrence long-term adverse event subsequent dose reduction discontinuation , thus allow long control underlie disease . All consideration lead reflexion design present study , say determine feasibility pazopanib treatment interruption reintroduction progression iodine refractory progressive DTC patient compare pazopanib continuous administration , 6 initial cycle pazopanib 800 mg daily patient include study , strong rationale intermittent administration pazopanib .</detailed_description>
