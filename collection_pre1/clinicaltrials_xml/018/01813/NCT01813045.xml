	<detailed_description>Integrins group molecules responsible intercellular adhesion signal . They comprise superfamily heterodimeric receptor compose 18 different α β subunit . In combination , generate 24 different receptor subtypes range physiological pathophysiological function [ Takada et al , 2007 ] . The αvβ3 receptor integrin find low level mature endothelial cell markedly regulate endothelial cell actively grow blood vessel . It previously know vitronectin receptor although subsequently find bind many ligand include fibrinogen , fibronectin , laminin , thrombospondin , von Willebrand factor , certain collagen subtypes . These feature also see αvβ5 integrin receptor , receptor recognise arginine-glycine-aspartate ( RGD ) motif present ligand . 1.1.2 Role αvβ3 αvβ5 Integrins Cardiovascular Disease The expression αvβ3 αvβ5 receptor regulate number diseased state particularly well characterise angiogenesis associate tumour growth metastasis [ Friedlander et al , 1995 ; Brooks et al , 1994 ] . However , many potential role integrin pathway cardiovascular disease include myocardial infarction , atherosclerosis , restenosis , aortic stenosis aneurysm disease relatively unexplored . 1.1.2.1 Myocardial Infarction After myocardial infarction , intense inflammatory response follow angiogenesis fibrosis . During time heal reparation , mark regulation integrins order orchestrate efficient myocardial healing . For αvβ3 αvβ5 integrin receptor , reflect angiogenesis fibrosis give ligand bind property [ van den Borne et al , 2008 ; Higuchi et al , 2008 ] . This centre early delayed leave ventricular remodelling infarct peri-infarct zone . The early phase dominate angiogenesis restore vascular integrity tissue perfusion αvβ3 αvβ5 receptor regulate express activated endothelial cell within newly form vessel [ Higuchi et al , 2008 ] . With subsequent myocardial healing remodelling , activation fibroblast differentiation myofibroblasts require αvβ3 αvβ5 receptor interaction central development fibrosis [ van den Borne et al , 2008 ] . Maladaptive fibrotic response adverse leave ventricular remodelling may underlie development heart failure follow myocardial infarction . These process pathway may also play role development myocardial fibrosis condition leave ventricular hypertrophy associate aortic stenosis [ Dweck et al , 2011 ] . 1.1.2.2 Atherosclerosis Restenosis The development atherosclerosis due complex interplay oxidise lipid , inflammatory cell infiltration , smooth muscle cell migration arterial wall . Once establish , atherosclerotic plaque may progress rupture lead clinical presentation acute myocardial infarction stroke . Features associate plaque rupture include thin fibrous cap , lipid-rich pool intraplaque haemorrhage . Indeed , plaque rupture particularly associate plaque neovascularisation vascular-endothelial growth factor expression [ Hiyama et al , 2010 ] suggest instability may induce angiogenesis . Thus , regulation αvβ3 αvβ5 receptor may represent novel marker , potential therapeutic target [ Maile et al , 2010 ] , plaque vulnerability . The process neointimal hyperplasia restenosis follow percutaneous coronary intervention involve recruitment vascular smooth muscle cell . This process also dependent αvβ3 αvβ5 receptor also potential target inhibition restenosis [ Kokubo et al , 2007 ] . 1.1.3 Fluciclatide Fluciclatide RGD-containing cyclic peptide recently develop 18F-radiotracer detect tumour angiogenesis positron emission tomography . It highly selective αvβ3 αvβ5 receptor affinity ( EC50 ) 11.1 0.1 nM respectively minimal cross reactivity αIIbβ3 receptor ( EC50 281 nM ) . Pre-clinical tumour work demonstrate 18F-fluciclatide take glioblastoma suppress anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor , sunitinib , confirm specificity fluciclatide area angiogenesis . It assess phase I clinical trial find safe well tolerate . 1.1.4 Aims To date , many preclinical study examine application radiotracers target αvβ3 αvβ5 integrin receptor . The clinical application tracer largely limited oncology method assess angiogenesis within tumour . Here wish explore role αvβ3 αvβ5 receptor radiotracer , 18F-fluciclatide , assess angiogenesis fibrosis two major cardiovascular disease area . Specifically , intend assess myocardial angiogenesis remodel patient recent myocardial infarction . We anticipate patient group co-existent aortic atheroma provide u opportunistic assessment tracer uptake atherosclerosis . We feel important ass range cardiovascular condition determine whether αvβ3 αvβ5 integrin receptor expression particular certain disease process . If successful , preliminary data permit detailed exploration specific disease area novel therapeutic intervention . At present , fluciclatide license approved clinical use use Investigational Agent explore pathophysiology aortic stenosis . 1.2 ORIGINAL HYPOTHESES We hypothesise 18F-fluciclatide identify expression αvβ3 αvβ5 integrin receptor vivo man two major cardiovascular disease area : acute myocardial infarction aortic atherosclerosis . Specifically , hypothesise 18F-fluciclatide : 1 . Demonstrate selective uptake within region myocardial infarction early phase recovery ( 1-3 week ) . 2 . Bind infarct remote region patient substantial myocardial infarction later phase recovery ( 6-12 week ) 3 . Be take aortic atherosclerotic plaque . 6 ASSESSMENTS 6.1 ANGIOGENESIS AND FIBROSIS FOLLOWING ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION Following acute myocardial infarction , intense regulation αvβ3 αvβ5 receptor initially help regulate angiogenesis restoration vascular integrity tissue perfusion addition delay expression associate development fibrosis within infarcted myocardium . We therefore assess patient two nine week acute myocardial infarction . Because possible undertake direct histological confirmation angiogenesis fibrosis population , compare finding patient establish collateral coronary blood flow chronic coronary artery occlusion well cardiac magnetic resonance image establish stable myocardial fibrosis . 6.1.1 Study Schedule On day 14±7 63±7 follow acute myocardial infarction , 30 patient undergo blood sample positron emission compute tomography scan 18F-fluciclatide . Following injection 18F-fluciclatide , patient monitor use standard clinical approach , include observation haemodynamic parameter , continue throughout study visit departure . They also undergo cardiac magnetic resonance image assessment gadolinium perfusion late enhancement day 14±7 6 12 month myocardial infarction . We specifically recruit two equal size matched population patient ( n=15 per group ) infarct-related artery , , revascularised percutaneous coronary intervention . In addition , similarly ass , single occasion , 10 age sex-matched patient chronic ( &gt; 6 month ) occlusion major epicardial vessel . Blood sample assess use standard clinical biochemical haematological profile full blood count urea electrolyte . In addition , marker cardiac ischaemia , fibrosis angiogenesis assess . Additional serum , plasma DNA store -80 degree Celsius future potential analysis . 6.1.2 Study Interpretation Given vessel fully establish , collateral artery infarcted myocardium patient chronic occlusion express αvβ3 αvβ5 receptor , act negative control . We also anticipate acute myocardial infarction unrevascularised complete coronary artery occlusion intensive uptake 18F-fluciclatide day 14 day 63 great early neovascularisation extensive infarction . Patients complete revascularisation likely modest angiogenesis fibrosis , therefore anticipate less intense 18F-fluciclatide uptake time point . Although comparator histology , cardiac magnetic resonance image provide u data extent myocardial infarction ( day 14 ) fibrosis ( 6 - 12 month ) , leave ventricular function , degree myocardial perfusion presence microvascular obstruction . We also assess entire infarct group ( n=30 ) determine whether extent 18F-fluciclatide uptake correlate magnetic resonance measure leave ventricular function remodelling follow infarction . We intend use image obtain 10 age sex match healthy subject recruit co-existing study title 'The identification vivo angiogenesis fibrosis aortic stenosis use positron emission tomography ' ( R &amp; D 2012/R/CAR/23 , REC 12/SS/0204 ) . These act negative control comparators healthy myocardium . It similar study involve use radiotracer 18F-Fluciclatide patient Aortic Stenosis . These patient undergo single CT-PET scan MRI scan assessment late gadolinium enhancement consent data use current study . 6.2 ANGIOGENESIS IN AORTIC ATHEROSCLEROSIS Patients acute myocardial infarction high prevalence concomitant aortic atherosclerosis . In Dr Dweck 's Fellowship , able exploit association undertake secondary analysis 18F-sodium fluoride uptake aortic coronary atherosclerosis [ Dweck et al , 2012b ] . This generate highly innovative finding inform understanding atherosclerosis role calcification . 6.2.1 Study Schedule We use datasets obtain patient explore uptake 18F-fluciclatide within thoracic aorta . Atherosclerosis identify use compute tomography magnetic resonance image obtain thorax time study scan . No additional image acquisition require . This provide pilot data inform subsequent dedicate study focus acutely inflame atherosclerotic plaque , patient recent transient ischaemic attack stroke attributable carotid disease .</detailed_description>
