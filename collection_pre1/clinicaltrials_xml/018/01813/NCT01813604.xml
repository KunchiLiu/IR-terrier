	<detailed_description>Global polio eradication initiative ( GPEI ) In 1988 , World Health Assembly adopt resolution polio eradication 2000 . This launch Global Polio Eradication Initiative ( GPEI ) , spearhead World Health Organization ( WHO ) , Rotary International , US Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) United Nations Children 's Emergency Fund ( UNICEF ) . The major strategy achieve polio eradication include : 1 ) provision 3-4 dos tOPV young infant routine immunization program ; 2 ) provision additional dos child &lt; 5 year age immunization campaign ( supplementary immunization activity SIAs ) ; 3 ) surveillance case acute flaccid paralysis child &lt; 15 year age ; 4 ) mop-up immunization campaign follow detection poliovirus circulation . OPV vaccine choice polio eradication due low cost , ease administration , ability induce intestinal immunity community spread aid induction immunity . Limitations trivalent oral polio vaccine ( tOPV ) tOPV mixture three type polioviruses interference among strain intestinal replication . Type 2 especially interferes uptake type 1 3. tOPV high seroconversion rate industrialized country compare develop country . A study conduct Brazil Gambia report tOPV seroconversion rate 85 % Type 1 , 94 % type 2 68 % Type 3 three dos tOPV . Compared monovalent OPVs , trivalent OPV low seroconversion rate . To address concern low efficacy tOPV type 1 type 3 compare monovalent vaccine , monovalent vaccine re-introduced polio eradication initiative . Monovalent OPVs immunogenic tOPV . In India , compare two dos tOPV give birth 30 day , type-specific seroconversion significantly high two dos mOPV1 ( 90 % vs. 63 % ) mOPV3 ( 84 % vs. 52 % ) . In South Africa , compare one dose tOPV give birth , type-specific seroconversion significantly high one dose mOPV1 ( 73 % vs. 39 % ) mOPV3 ( 58 % vs. 21 % ) . While high immunogenicity monovalent vaccine compare trivalent vaccine highly desirable especially presence poliovirus outbreak cause one antigenic type , monovalent vaccine increase complication vaccine selection . Wild type 2 poliovirus eradicate 1999 present time global circulation wild poliovirus Type 1 3 . Weak routine immunization poor immunization coverage lead immunity gap three type poliovirus . In presence Type 1 poliovirus outbreak country weak routine immunization , use monovalent Type 1 poliovirus vaccine contribute reduce immunity gap Type 1 poliovirus , however , would address exist immunity gap Type 3 poliovirus vice versa . Additionally , presence outbreak Type 1 Type 3 poliovirus , vaccine selection becomes complicate . To address concern , bivalent OPV ( bOPV ) , mixture type 1 type 3 , introduce polio eradication program 2010 . The published clinical trial bOPV report two dos bOPV give birth 30 day later comparable immunogenicity two dos mOPV1 mOPV3 significantly good two dos tOPV . Oral poliovirus vaccine live attenuate viral vaccine vaccine virus OPV mutate acquire neurovirulence cause paralysis either due vaccine-associated paralytic polio ( VAPP ) due circulate vaccine-derived poliovirus ( cVDPV ) , attenuate vaccine virus acquire ability cause paralysis also circulate similar wild poliovirus ( WPV ) . The potential vaccine virus acquire neurovirulence cause paralytic poliomyelitis incompatible eradication polio . Therefore , polio eradication require eventual cessation OPVs . The last case type 2 WPV ( WPV2 ) report 1999 India . Type 2 vaccine virus tOPV likely cause cVDPVs 80 % cVDPVs past decade cVDPV2 . Of estimate 250-500 annual VAPP case almost 40 % due type 2 . Thus , eradication WPV2 imperative prioritize removal type 2 contain OPV . Role bivalent oral polio vaccine ( bOPV ) inactivate polio vaccine ( IPV ) The licensing availability bivalent OPV ( bOPV ) contain type 1 3 offer option OPV contain OPV2 . No study assess immunogenicity bOPV administer Expanded Program Immunization ( EPI ) schedule 6 , 10 14 week age . Additionally , study compare immunogenicity bOPV tOPV administer 6 , 10 14 week age . Thus , comparison propose study inclusion bOPV tOPV arm . At time , switch routine immunization tOPV bOPV propose , significant challenge need address prior implement possible switch . Removing type 2 OPV routine immunization rapidly increase proportion population susceptible type 2 . This turn could facilitate transmission cVDPV2 country experience outbreak cVDPV2 . Ideally , cVDPV2 outbreak need stop prior replacement tOPV bOPV . Equally important need synchronization cessation type 2 OPV globally regionally reduce risk cVDPV2 importation country continue use tOPV . The IPV work group Strategic Advisory Group Experts Immunization ( SAGE ) endorse set necessary pre-requisites type 2 OPV cessation include : formal validation absence WPV2 , interruption cVDPV2 prior OPV2 cessation , laboratory containment WPV2 , availability sufficient bOPV switch stockpile monovalent oral vaccine ( mOPV ) outbreak response . At time , clear recognition would take year achieve necessary pre-requisites balance already shift benefit risk type 2 OPV . Another potential option switch tOPV IPV IPV substantially expensive OPV immunogenic OPV induce mucosal immunity . Hence , polio eradication program explore way make IPV affordable polio eradication include reduce number IPV dose , reduce antigen content dose , manufacture IPV develop country optimize production process . One possible method reduce antigen content dose IPV use fractional injection IPV ( f-IPV ) one-fifth standard IPV dose give intra-dermally . Compared intra-muscular injection IPV , appear f-IPV sub-optimal immunogenicity administer 6 , 10 14 week age ( EPI schedule ) [ ID f-IPV v IM IPV : Type 1 : 53 % vs 89 % ; Type 2 : 85 % vs 96 % ; Type 3 : 69 % vs 99 % ] though immunogenicity comparable administer 2 , 4 6 month age [ ID f-IPV v IM IPV : Type 1 : 97 % vs 100 % ; Type 2 : 96 % vs 100 % ; Type 3 : 98 % vs 100 % ] . Prior study report interval multiple dos IPV play important role immunogenicity IPV 11 . A study conduct Cuba report seroconversion rate 94 % , 83 % 100 % Type 1 , 2 3 respectively 3 dos IM IPV administer 6 , 10 14 week age . These seroconversion rate similar seroconversion observe 2 dos IPV administer 8 16 week age ( Type 1 : 90 % ; Type 2 : 89 % ; Type 3 : 90 % ) . Hence , hypothesize 1-month interval 3 dos EPI schedule major contributor sub-optimal immunogenicity f-IPV compare immunogenicity report 2 , 4 6 month schedule , 2-month interval dos . As result study immunogenicity IM IPV ID f-IPV administer 6 14 week assess interval dos 2 month . Justification study There significant risk associate switch tOPV bOPV routine immunization . IM IPV substantially expensive tOPV immunogenic inducing mucosal immunity . These principal reason prevent use IM IPV EPI schedule . ID f-IPV sub-optimal immunogenicity use EPI schedule . Therefore , polio program need test immunogenicity combination poliovirus vaccine could potentially address concern risk use bOPV alone suboptimal immunogenicity ID f-IPV . Prior study show IPV OPV give together combination sequentially OPV follow IPV achieve high seroconversion IPV OPV alone mucosal immunity induce combined IPV OPV similar induce OPV . However , seroconversion sequential f-IPV bOPV yet determine . Consequently , study assess immunogenicity sequential dose f-IPV bOPV . Combining bOPV f-IPV immunization schedule multiple advantage . Firstly , f-IPV aid development Type 2 immunity . Secondly , bOPV combine f-IPV likely immunogenic f-IPV alone . Finally , bOPV likely contribute substantially development Type 1 3 mucosal immunity . Rationale location study study population Polio immunization Bangladesh provide Expanded Program Immunization achieve high routine coverage 3 dos tOPV infant young 12 month National Immunization Days usually conduct twice year . The 3 dos tOPV routine immunization service administer infant 6 , 10 14 week age WHO/UNICEF estimate coverage 95 % 2010 three dos polio vaccine . With strategy , Bangladesh interrupt endemic transmission 2000 successfully prevent outbreaks re-establishment circulation follow importation neighbor India . With interruption polio transmission , Bangladesh critical juncture need consider step reduce risk associate emergence VDPV2 . Therefore , advantageous test potential new combination exist polio vaccine reduce risk VDPV2 emergence Bangladesh . The result study applicable Bangladesh well important global polio eradication program . ICDDR , B long-standing expertise conduct clinical trial conduct polio clinical trial propose site Mirpur , Dhaka . This study report seroconversion 86 % Type1 , 97 % Type 2 75 % Type 3 3 dos tOPV 6 , 10 14 week age .</detailed_description>
