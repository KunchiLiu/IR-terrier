	<brief_summary>This research study Phase II clinical trial , test safety effectiveness investigational drug learn whether drug work treat specific cancer . `` Investigational '' mean drug study . It find people NSCLC change ( mutation ) certain gene call RET gene . This mutated gene may help cancer cell grow . Only participant RET mutation allow participate . In study , investigator test strategy use study drug design inhibit shut growth signal result mutate RET gene . Ponatinib anti-cancer drug use research study type cancer . Ponatinib block several growth signal cancer cell , include RET . In research study , investigator look see whether ponatinib effective safe treat NSCLC harbor RET rearrangement .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants research study ask undergo screening test procedure confirm eligibility . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn participant take part research study . These test procedure include follow : medical history , vital sign , physical exam , performance status , electrocardiogram , echocardiogram , routine blood test , pregnancy test assessment tumor CT MRI . If test show participant eligible participate research study , he/she begin study treatment . If patient meet eligibility criterion , he/she able participate research study . Participants take study drug day , every day cycle . Each treatment cycle last 28 day ( 4 week ) . Participants give drug diary record drug take day . The diary also include special instruction take study drug . For cycle 1-20 , participant visit clinic test procedures do time point list : On Day 1-physical exam , vital sign , performance status , electrocardiogram , routine blood test , pharmacokinetic test , clinical exam assessment tumor . On day 15 cycle 1-vital sign , routine blood test clinical exam . For cycle 11 , participant visit clinic every 6 week . Some visit happen Day 1 cycle visit happen Day 15 cycle . At visit , follow test procedure do : physical exam , vital sign , performance status , electrocardiogram , routine blood test , clinical exam , assessment tumor . Participants visit clinic study doctor take study drug permanently . They also visit clinic 30 day stop take study drug . The following test procedures do : physical exam , vital sign , performance status , electrocardiogram , routine blood test , pregnancy test , clinical exam tumor assessment . Investigators would also like keep track participant 's medical condition two year first study dose . Investigators contact participant telephone every 3 month . If participant still come clinic , visit might use contact .</detailed_description>
