	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Effectiveness Safety Tapentadol ( CG5503 ) Treatment Acute Pain From Bunionectomy Compared With Placebo</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients undergo bunionectomy ( surgical procedure remove bunion , enlargement joint base big toe comprise bone soft tissue ) often experience moderate severe acute pain post-surgery . Normally pain controlled patient receive repeat dos opioid analgesic . Tapentadol ( CG5503 ) newly synthesize opioid drug act centrally act analgesic like opioid analgesic different mode action . This study , randomize ( patient assign different treatment base chance ) , double-blind ( neither investigator patient know treatment patient receives ) , placebo-controlled ( placebo inactive substance compare drug test whether drug real effect clinical trial ) , parallel-group ( group patient treat time ) , multicenter study ( study perform one clinic ) design evaluate effectiveness ( level pain control ) safety ( side effect ) tapentadol immediate-release ( IR ) 50 mg 75 mg versus placebo . The study consist screen phase , patient evaluate study entry ( Days -28 -2 ) follow surgical period ( Day -1 ) bunionectomy perform start first surgical incision continue termination popliteal sciatic block ( PSB ) infusion . During qualification period ( Day 1 ) start termination post-operative continuous PSB infusion , patient evaluate entry double blind treatment phase . Patients randomly assign one three treatment group receive either 50 mg tapentadol IR , 75 mg tapentadol IR placebo PI equal great 4 0-10 numerical rating scale . The inpatient double-blind treatment period 72 hour duration include final end-of-double-blind evaluation ( Day 4 , i.e. , 72 hour administration first dose ) patient . Any patient requiring analgesia pain relief addition study drug double-blind treatment period discontinue study due lack efficacy . All patient discontinue lack efficacy complete pain assessment Patient Global Impression Change ( PGIC ) receive rescue medication . Pain intensity pain relief periodically assessed treatment period use rating scale . Safety evaluation include monitor adverse event , physical examination , clinical laboratory test . The study length , include screen period , maximum duration 32 day .</detailed_description>
