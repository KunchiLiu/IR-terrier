	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety effectiveness investigational study drug call carfilzomib . The investigator want find effect , good and/or bad , patient cancer treatment continue beyond previous carfilzomib treatment study . Carfilzomib ( KyprolisTM ) approve U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) use certain U.S. patient relapse refractory multiple myeloma try failed therapy . It approve used disease condition . In study , carfilzomib refer investigational study drug approve use patient multiple myeloma United States , approve regulatory authority ( agency responsible approve use medicine country Health Canada ) . Carfilzomib type drug call proteasome inhibitor . A proteasome protein find within cell important role identify mark damage protein need destroy cell survival . The inhibition proteasome allow damage protein accumulate within cell . This accumulation damage protein cause cell die .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Study Carfilzomib Relapsed Waldenström 's Macroglobulinemia ( WM ) IST-CAR-531</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Waldenström 's macroglobulinemia ( WM ) rare low-grade B-cell lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma . Overall report incidence approximately 3 case per million person per year 1500 case diagnose annually United States . There high incidence male compare female ( 3.4 vs 1.7 case per 1 million person-years risk ) WM nearly twice common among white compare black . [ 1 ] A familial form disease also recognize . WM indolent disease overall median survival 5 year although recent data suggest disease-specific median survival 11.2 year , give frequently old age ( median 63 year ) accompany co-morbidities diagnosis ( 1 ) . WM characterize infiltration lymphoplasmacytic cell bone marrow serum immunoglobulin M ( IgM ) monoclonal gammopathy . B-cell origin clinical cellular epidemiological feature share among WM arise intermediately mature B cell ( somatically mutate post germinal center lymphocytes yet undergone isotype switching ) , opposed immature B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia arises fully mature , somatically mutate , cell multiple myeloma arises . There standard care WM ( 2 ) . Therefore , involve patient 's clinical trial strongly recommend whenever possible .</detailed_description>
