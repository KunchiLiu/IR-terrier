	<brief_summary>This study patient malignant melanoma spread beyond local area surgically remove , melanoma tumor accessible repeat biopsy . This research study way gain new knowledge treatment option metastatic melanoma . This research study evaluate effect drug vemurafenib cobimetinib immune system . Vemurafenib approve FDA treatment patient advance melanoma harbor B-RAF mutation . Vemurafenib work block protein call B-RAF . Researchers find large number melanoma mutation ( change ) BRAF gene . Genes specific part DNA contain information hereditary characteristic hair color eye color . The BRAF gene code protein call B-RAF , involve sending signal cell lead cell growth . Research determine mutation BRAF gene V600 position cause change B-RAF protein drive growth spread melanoma cell . Cobimetinib ( GDC-0973 , XL518 ) potent highly selective inhibitor MEK1 MEK2 , central component RAS/RAF pathway . The purpose research study determine vemurafenib cobitmetinib may alter immune system 's reaction melanoma , order learn best combine immune therapy vemurafenib future .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Vemurafenib + Cobimetinib Immunity Patients With Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-arm , multicenter study vemurafenib patient biopsy-accessible advanced metastatic melanoma . The trial consist screen period , treatment phase , one post-study follow-up visit occur 30 day last dose drug . Day 1 study define first day subject receive vemurafenib and/or cobitmetinib . During treatment phase , study assessment conduct Day 1 ( ± 3 day ) cycle , exception compute tomography ( CT ) and/or magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , occur every 6 week ( +/- 7 day ) . All subject biopsy perform safely accessible tumor start treatment 1 , 2 , 4 week later ( day 8 , 15 , 29 ) . In addition , patient accessible tumor time progression tumor biopsy perform time . Mixed-effects model use study change CD8 T cell count per mm2 tissue , change expression immunoinhibitory protein ( B7-H1/PD-L1 , IDO , arginase ) , change endothelial home receptor ligands tumor associate chemokines pre-treatment pre-treatment week 1 , 2 , 4 therapy . Subjects treat random effect account individual variability . Potential covariates age , gender , ECOG performance status . 60 ml blood lymphocyte draw day 1 , 8 , 15 , 29 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histological cytological confirm melanoma metastatic unresectable stage III clearly progressive . Melanoma must document contain BRAFV600 mutation FDA approve assay Age &gt; 18 year ECOG PS 0,1 , 2 Participants must measurable melanoma . Measurable disease define least one lesion measure accurately least one dimension ( long diameter record ) ≥ 20 mm conventional technique ≥ 10 mm spiral CT scan . Cutaneous subcutaneous lesion may consider measurable measure reliably ≥ 10 mm direct physical exam measurement . In addition , participant must also separate disease , may may measurable defined RECIST , must readily accessible core needle biopsy , excisional biopsy , and/or surgical resection . This disease may include one large tumor tissue deposit biopsy harvest multiple time may include multiple deposit biopsied , excise individually , different date . Please see suggested minimum size requirement tumor tissue use biopsy research : 1 lesion ≥ 5 cm3 2 lesion ≥ 3 cm3 3 lesion ≥ 2 cm3each OR ≥ 3 skin lesion , surface area approximately 1 cm2 ( aggregate several lesion ) total volume tumor I approximately 260325 mm3 great biopsy time point . These subject need ≥ 3 epidermal/dermal tumor lesion ; excisional tumor tissue biopsy perform one lesion time point . It acceptable biopsy one lesion , may less 1 cm2 surface area , long total tissue remove surface area approximately 1 cm2 great . A combination may acceptable , long appear enough tumor tissue remove approximately 325 mm3 tissue time point . Lesion volume calculate base formula volume sphere ( 4/3 r3 ) . An acceptable approximation lesion approach spherical shape multiply diameter three perpendicular direction divide 2 . [ Volume ~ ½ ( D1xD2xD3 ) ; e.g . : volume 2 x 2 x 3 cm lesion approximately 6 cm3 . Lesion measurement base length X width X depth ( height ) sample . ] Women must pregnant due fact effect vemurafenib and/or cobimetinib develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation 6 month completion study treatment . See Appendix H acceptable unacceptable form contraception . Should woman become pregnant participate study , inform treat physician immediately . All female childbearing potential must blood test urine study within 2 week prior registration rule pregnancy . A female childbearing potential woman , regardless sexual orientation whether undergone tubal ligation , meet follow criterion : 1 ) undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; 2 ) naturally postmenopausal least 24 consecutive month ( i.e. , menses time precede 24 consecutive month ) . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother vemurafenib and/or cobimetinib , breastfeed must discontinue prior treatment Day 1 study . Patients must measurable disease define Section 9.1 . Cutaneous lesion lymph node measure least 1 cm consider measurable . Baseline CT MRI scan measurable disease site must perform within 4 week study entry . Patients may receive number prior systemic treatment regimen distant metastatic disease advance regional disease . The following prior therapy permit either adjuvant metastatic disease setting : 1 . No prior therapy 2 . Immunotherapy consist interferonalpha , interleukin2 , GMCSF , ipilimumab , antiPD1 , cancer vaccine , experimental agent . 3 . Cytotoxic chemotherapy consist dacarbazine , temozolomide , carboplatin , paclitaxel alone combination . 4 . Targeted therapy temsirolimus , bevacizumab , sorafenib . Patients prior therapy MEK inhibitor inhibitor mutant BRAF ineligible . Because sorafenib low efficacy BRAF inhibitor , prior therapy allow . Patients must discontinue cytotoxic therapy agent least 4 week cytokine immunoregulatory antibody base immunotherapy least 6 week prior enter study recover adverse event due agent .
