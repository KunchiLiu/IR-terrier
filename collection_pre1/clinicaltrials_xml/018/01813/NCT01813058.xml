	<brief_title>Does Tranexamic Acid Decrease Blood Loss Pediatric Idiopathic Scoliosis Surgery ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective randomize double-blinded study enroll 120 child adolescent age undergo scoliosis repair diagnosis idiopathic scoliosis . The primary aim determine intravenous infusion TXA effective standard care ( TXA ) decrease blood loss blood transfusion perioperatively child adolescent present scoliosis surgery . Aims : 1 . Investigate compare efficacy TXA ( measure intraoperative blood loss blood transfusion ) intravenously administer surgery v placebo patient idiopathic scoliosis come surgery . 2 . Determine PK profile TXA child adolescent undergo scoliosis surgery . 3 . Investigate contribution different factor ( plasma concentration TXA , age related difference PK/PD renal function , polymorphism Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 ( PAI-1 ) gene PAI-1 level TXA efficacy pediatric patient undergo scoliosis surgery . 4 . Determine safety profile intravenous TXA child adolescent present scoliosis surgery . Following standardized general anesthetic protocol , patient come idiopathic scoliosis randomize either : 1. placebo i.e . saline 0.9 % ( intravenous injection ) 2. intravenous TXA give load dose 15 minute 50 mg/kg bolus ( 30- 60 minute prior surgical incision ) 10 mg/kg/hr infusion duration surgery . During surgery , follow standardize , define fluid , blood blood production management protocol . The follow data part routine patient care collect study purpose : 1 . Age , weight , height , gender , race , coexist disease , preoperative hemoglobin , hematocrit , platelet , PT , PTT , INR , creatinine . 2 . Intraoperative data : total volume intraoperative blood loss estimate weigh sponge amount blood suction canister , total volume unit blood product administer , total volume cell saver blood administer , total volume crystalloid colloid agent administer , hemodynamic parameter ; mean arterial blood pressure &amp; heart rate , total urine output , total surgical time , number spinal level involve . 3 . Laboratory data : Perioperative baseline serial hemoglobin , hematocrit , platelet count , PT , PTT , INR fibrinogen dictate standard clinical practice . 4 . Postoperative data collection include : blood transfusion requirement first 24 hour surgery , amount blood collect surgical drain first 24 hour postoperatively , occurrence postoperative complication duration ICU hospital stay . A research team member follow patient daily surgery follow-up phone call make family one month discharge hospital aim identify adverse event related TXA . Potential adverse advent include hypersensitivity allergic reaction tranexamic acid , thromboembolic event , neurological complication , development renal insufficiency . Adverse event report immediately IRB per institutional protocol . As estimate blood loss somewhat inaccurate , blood loss also calculate previously describe . The following measure part routine patient care require study protocol : During course operation , total four sample consist 2 ml blood drawn arterial catheter DNA , PAI-1 protein level , baseline TXA . After study drug infusion start , subsequent 2 ml sample draw utilize one four different sample scheme randomly assign . TXA plasma concentration measure described modification make laboratory18 . The sample immediately anticoagulated ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) store ice . Plasma separate centrifugation ( 1000g x10 min 4oC ) store -70 oC pending analysis TXA concentration . TXA plasma concentration measure use high performance liquid chromatography ( HPLC ) ultrafiltration derivatization18 . Recruitment Methods : Potential eligibility study identify via surgical schedule screen daily designate member research team . A cover letter , brochure , consent form mail prospective patient 's family prior schedule pre-operative appointment . The study protocol review patient/family query address day visit preoperative clinic prior schedule date surgery . Informed consent obtain parents/legal guardian per institutional IRB guideline . The child 's assent ( appropriate ) also obtain least 24 hour schedule surgery possible . Data Analysis Plan : A preliminary power analysis indicate total sample size 120 child randomize equally TXA vs. standard care ( TXA ) provide 80 % power ( α = 0.05 , β = 0.20 ) detect decrease 30 % 10 % patient loose significant amount blood ( defined &gt; /= 25 ml/kg ) use chi-square test independent binomial proportion assume standard deviation 25 % ( effect size = 1.2 ) ( version 7.0 , nQuery Advisor , Statistical Solutions , Saugus , MA ) . Adverse Event Criteria Reporting Procedures : Potential adverse event include hypersensitivity allergic reaction tranexamic acid component , thromboembolic event , neurologic event seizure , hypotension ( rapid IV administration ) . In awake patient , follow report : nausea , diarrhea vomiting . The patient assess next day member research team interview occurrence adverse event . In event serious adverse event , report IRB immediately study halt thorough investigation cause make . Data Safety Monitoring Plan Data collection study include collection data pertain adverse event . Any adverse event promptly report IRB member research team responsible data safety monitoring . Data safety monitoring review research team every 10 subject recruit earlier specific problem identify</detailed_description>
