	<brief_summary>The inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , ulcerative colitis ( UC ) Crohn 's disease ( CD ) chronic condition affect approximately 1.4 million Americans . The burden Clostridium difficile infection ( CDI ) , frequent cause infectious diarrhea mediate toxins A B increase faster IBD patient , general population . Clinically , CDI patient IBD lead range clinical syndrome symptomless carriage , severe life threaten colitis , colectomy death . This pilot study look relationship IBD variable host immune response . Clostridium difficile colonization ( asymptomatic carrier state ) low IBD population general population . In general population , high antitoxin titer link colonization low antitoxin titer recurrent disease . The investigator hypothesize patient IBD low Clostridium difficile colonization lower antibody titer control group . Additionally low titer increase risk develop CDI . In Aim 1 investigator determine Clostridium colonization IBD subject stool study ( include CD , UC UC patient IPAA ) compare non-IBD subject ( control ) . In Aim 2 investigator compare antitoxin titer IBD subject compare control . In Aim 3 investigator follow subject 12 month calculate incidence CDI patient IBD compare control association anti-toxin titer .</brief_summary>
