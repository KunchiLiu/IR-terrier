	<brief_title>Clinical Trial Based Use Mononuclear Cells From Autologous Bone Marrow Patients With Pseudoarthrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An estimate 10 % closed fracture 35-45 % case open fracture , risk develop delay process consolidation complete failure ( pseudoarthrosis ) depend location , severity trauma bone , soft tissue vascular structure Some case refractory treatment method available today , require numerous intervention potential risk recurrent infection carry . For reason , treatment remain challenge orthopedic surgeon . Recent advance knowledge cellular molecular biology relate mechanism bone repair biomaterials science join new discipline call tissue engineering , implementation clinical practice do progressive . Cell therapy base use adult stem cell ( MSCs ) derive autologous bone marrow , introduce new application repair fracture include pseudoarthrosis avascular bone necrosis . Its mechanism action focus local action , also release signal molecule autocrine paracrine action recruitment activation endogenous MSCs osteoblastic differentiation bone tissue regeneration . On hand , seed MSCs biomaterials ( natural synthetic ) effective , facilitate adherence , proliferation extracellular matrix production area implant . Today , investigator say experimental clinical evidence support effectiveness method . The investigator design phase II clinical trial check feasibility approach .</detailed_description>
