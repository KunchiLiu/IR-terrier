	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To determine efficacy ( assessed progression-free survival [ PFS ] ) vandetanib compare placebo participant differentiate thyroid cancer either locally advanced metastatic refractory unsuitable radioiodine therapy . Secondary Objectives : - To determine efficacy vandetanib compare placebo participant population assess efficacy variable include duration response ( DOR ) , objective response rate ( ORR ) , change tumour size ( TS ) overall survival ( OS ) . - To evaluate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) vandetanib participant population potentially investigate influence participant demography pathophysiology vandetanib PK . - To demonstrate improvement time worsen pain ( TWP ) participant treat vandetanib compare placebo participant population . - To evaluate safety tolerability vandetanib treatment participant population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants receive vandetanib randomize treatment allow , upon re-consent , continue open-label vandetanib opinion Investigator participant still receive benefit . Placebo participant experience disease progression within 60 day unblinding may offer option treatment open-label vandetanib , Investigator 's opinion , treatment may clinical benefit participant . Approximately 2 year ; duration vary depend individual participant response .</detailed_description>
