	<brief_title>Test Intervention Increase Physical Activity Among School Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This project address current epidemic obesity physical inactivity among adolescent United States . The goal research develop effective way encourage adolescent become remain physically active . In particular , project concern identify adolescent reluctant exercise high sensitivity unpleasant feeling exercise high intensity . Once identify , adolescent target intervention design teach exercise intensity level generate pleasant feeling therefore make likely seek opportunity physically active . The specific aim study : 1 ) evaluate impact novel intervention deliver via school-based physical education ( PE ) adolescent high sensitivity exercise-induced negative affect ; 2 ) determine whether adolescent ' tendency feel uncomfortable exercise stable trait persists even face intervention ; 3 ) compare contrast three alternative method measure adolescent ' sensitivity exercise-induced affect . Healthy middle-school student participate team individual competitive sport recruit assessed determine exist predisposition toward exercise ( i.e. , `` reluctant exerciser '' `` latent exerciser '' ) . The assessment conduct use three method use measure individual ' propensity experience positive affect face stimulus : 1 ) pencil-and-paper assessment measure tendency respond challenge positive affect ; 2 ) electroencephalogram ( EEG ) ascertain frontal cortical asymmetry ; 3 ) empirically assess affective response standardize exercise task . Reluctant latent exerciser assign equal number one two condition . One condition implement PE-based intervention differs traditional approach student instructed exercise intensity determine elicit positive affect individual ( base baseline test ) . In condition , student instruct exercise intensity derive standard formula typically use exercise prescription . It hypothesize non-traditional approach increase reluctant exerciser ' enjoyment PE also level participation physical activity outside PE . The latter determine use portable monitor ( accelerometer ) wear baseline , intervention , 1 year end intervention . This study relevant prevention type 2 diabetes address mechanisms physical activity behavior change among adolescent . This developmental period typically characterize decline participation physical activity , thus represent critical period intervention . The result increase understanding adolescent remain active others test novel intervention may effective among reluctant exerciser .</detailed_description>
