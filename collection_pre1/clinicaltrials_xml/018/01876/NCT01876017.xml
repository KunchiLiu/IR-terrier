	<brief_title>Safety Efficacy BMMNC Patients With Chronic Renal Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic kidney failure , also call chronic kidney disease , describe gradual loss kidney function . Kidney failure medical condition kidney fail filter metabolic waste toxin body series symptom develop .It common , frequently un recognise often exist together condition ( example , cardiovascular disease diabetes ) . When advanced , also carry high risk mortality . The risk develop CKD ( Chronic Kidney diseases ) increase increase age , condition coexist CKD become severe kidney dysfunction advance CKD progress establish renal failure small significant percentage people . This classification divide CKD five stage . Stages 3-5 may define glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) alone , whereas stage 1 2 also require presence persistent proteinuria , albuminuria haematuria , structural abnormality . Stem cell two important characteristic distinguish type cell . First , unspecialized cell renew long period cell division . The second certain physiologic experimental condition , induce become cell special function beat cell heart muscle insulin- produce cell pancreas well neuron brain.So approach prove safety efficacy stem cell CRF</detailed_description>
