	<brief_summary>Low-grade systemic inflammation associate obesity may worsen clinical course psoriasis . Both low-calorie diet nutritional supplementation show impact clinical course psoriasis , include anti-inflammatory effect n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFAs ) . This study aim assess effectiveness energy-restricted diet , enrich n-3 PUFAs poor n-6 PUFAs , metabolic marker clinical outcome obese patient psoriasis . Methods : Forty-four obese patient mild-to-severe plaque-type psoriasis treat immuno-suppressive drug randomize assume either usual diet energy-restricted diet ( 20 kcal/kg/ideal body weight/day ) enrich n-3 PUFAs ( average 2.6 g/d ) . All patient continue immuno-modulating therapy throughout study . End-point measure include anthropometric , biochemical clinical parameter baseline , 3 6 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>n-3 Polysaturated Fatty Acids-rich Diet Psoriasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Psoriasis one common chronic inflammatory skin disorder , affect 2 % general population . It consider T-cell-mediated inflammatory skin disease characterize hyper-proliferation poor differentiation epidermal keratinocytes . Even susceptibility psoriasis inherit , inflammatory reaction modulate diet , lifestyle environmental factor infection stress . Polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFAs ) show promise safe adjunctive treatment many skin disorder , include psoriasis . There two main family PUFAs : n-3 n-6 PUFAs . Alpha-linolenic acid ( ALA ) essential n-3 PUFA , linoleic acid essential n-6 PUFA . These fatty acid form building block downstream long-chain fatty acid : On n-6 side , linoleic acid convert gamma-linolenic acid ( GLA ) dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid ( DGLA ) , latter may convert either pro-inflammatory arachidonic acid ( AA ) anti-inflammatory prostaglandin , prostaglandin E1 ( PGE1 ) . AA ( also derive diet ) primarily precursor pro-inflammatory eicosanoids , prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) , leukotrienes , much small extent , anti-inflammatory prostacyclin . On n-3 side , small amount ALA convert eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) . EPA serve primarily precursor anti-inflammatory prostaglandin , prostaglandin E3 ( PGE3 ) inhibit production AA DGLA production PGE2 thromboxane AA . Skin cell produce eicosanoids response various stimulus contribute inflammatory conditions.The active involvement fatty acid skin health epidermal barrier function justifies choice systemic supplementation n-3PUFA effective strategy improvement inflammatory condition . Epidemiological observation low incidence autoimmune inflammatory disorder , include psoriasis , population Greenland Eskimos compare gender- age-matched group live Denmark provide early suggestive evidence important role n-3 PUFAs dietary intake inflammation . An improvement psoriasis also observe daily dietary supplementation fish oil contain n-3 PUFAs . As mentioned , AA pro-inflammatory fatty acid . As result , low dietary intake AA , typical low-protein vegetarian diet , may produce less anti-inflammatory effect . The Western diet `` deficient '' n-3 PUFAs , n-6/n-3 ratio 15/1 16/1 , compare 1/1 ratio find wild animal presumably human being prior industrial revolution . Although ability low-protein diet improve symptom psoriasis patient consistently support remarkable treatment efficacy report patient Schamberg . In case-control study , Naldi et al show increased intake fresh fruit certain vegetable link decreased prevalence psoriasis , although mechanism clear . Calorie restriction and/or weight loss may also influence symptom severity psoriasis . In obese patient moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis , weight loss show improve therapeutic response cyclosporine . In mouse , four week calorie restriction ( 33 % energy intake ) lead decrease 45 % epidermal cell proliferation rate . Likewise , symptoms inflammatory disease rheumatoid arthritis show improved fasting low-energy diet . Associations also recognize psoriasis increase incidence metabolic syndrome ( visceral obesity , diabetes insulin resistance , hypertension , dyslipidemia ) . Although link psoriasis individual component metabolic syndrome completely elucidate , visceral fat , release pro-inflammatory cytokine , appear play role metabolic syndrome psoriasis . Additional factor influence severity psoriasis examine , alcohol consumption . Alcohol may enhance production inflammatory cytokine cell cycle activator , could lead epidermal hyperproliferation . Although generally recognize decisive cure psoriasis , many treatment commonly use reduce severity symptom lessen impact patient 's quality life . For moderate-to-severe psoriasis , phototherapy topical and/or systemic therapy standard medical therapy . Examples include corticosteroid , emollient , tar , methotrexate , cyclosporine . However , many treatment associate significant adverse effect . Some alternative systemic therapy include monoclonal antibody , fumaric acid ester , vitamin D analog , novel retinoids , macrolactams , biologic immune modifier anti-tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) agent . The present study explore effectiveness energy-restricted n-3 fatty acid-rich diet nutritional clinical outcome obese patient mild-to-severe psoriasis .</detailed_description>
