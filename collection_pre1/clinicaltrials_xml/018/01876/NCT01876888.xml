	<detailed_description>Patient satisfaction physical therapy become important concern health care , use monitor patient perception quality physical therapy care service . Measurement patient satisfaction may provide useful information may improve quality health care . The `` MedRisk Instrument Measuring Patient Satisfaction With Physical Therapy Care '' ( MRPS ) one instrument , undergone reliability validation testing.The MRPS 20-item ( 18 item 2 global measure ) questionnaire assess patient experience therapist , registration process convenience environment . A survey consecutive sample patient various region Turkey receive outpatient physiotherapy program recruited.The study divide two phase : Phase I , cross-cultural adaptation , involve translation procedure Turkish preliminary probe target population ; phase II , involve reliability validation study . After provide informed consent , test-retest reliability , subject ask complete MRPS twice ; first least receive three session physiotherapy second four day later could coincide date discharge later . Subjects provide information regard age , sex , location primary symptom prior complete instrument.Factor structure . The construct validity evaluate factor analysis method . An exploratory factor analysis , use principal component analysis varimax rotation performed.Criterion validity address determine correlation two global measure satisfaction 18 item . The measurement property potential factor investigate determine correlation factor global measure 10-cm Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) evaluate level patient satisfaction high score indicate good satisfaction . Pearson correlation coefficient use assess strength linear relationship . Test-retest reliability examine calculate Intraclass Correlation Coefficient ( ICC ) . Internal consistency relate homogeneity instrument , assess Cronbach 's alpha</detailed_description>
