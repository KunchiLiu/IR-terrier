	<brief_title>Pegylated Irinotecan NKTR 102 Treating Patients With Relapsed Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate 18-week progression free survival ( PFS ) rate relapse small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) patient treat NKTR-102 ( pegylated irinotecan NKTR 102 ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate objective response rate . II . To evaluate duration response . III . To evaluate overall survival . IV . To evaluate toxicity NKTR-102 patient population . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To explore correlation UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family , polypeptide A cluster ( UGTIA1 ) polymorphisms NKTR-102 toxicity . OUTLINE : Patients receive pegylated irinotecan NKTR 102 intravenously ( IV ) 90 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
