	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose dasatinib give together cytarabine idarubicin hydrochloride see well work treat patient acute myeloid leukemia likely come back spread . Dasatinib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , cytarabine idarubicin hydrochloride , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving dasatinib together cytarabine idarubicin hydrochloride may better treatment acute myeloid leukemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dasatinib , Cytarabine , Idarubicin Treating Patients With High-Risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Of dose level study , determine maximum tolerate dose dasatinib give combination cytarabine idarubicin treatment high risk acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) . ( Phase I ) II . To determine anti-tumor activity dasatinib give combination cytarabine idarubicin , assess complete remission rate ( CR ) remission duration . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To document CR survival outcome ( overall , event-free ) . ( Phase I ) II . To estimate survival probability ( overall event-free ) cumulative incidence relapse/progression . ( Phase II ) III . To describe summarize toxicity organ severity . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study dasatinib , follow phase II study . Patients receive cytarabine intravenously ( IV ) continuously 168 hour day 1-7 , dasatinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-7 , idarubicin hydrochloride IV day 1-3 . Patients non-responsive disease day 30 may receive second course therapy ( re-induction therapy ) within 1 week absence unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 2 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
