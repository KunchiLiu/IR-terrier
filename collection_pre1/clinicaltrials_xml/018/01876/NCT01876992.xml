	<brief_summary>The investigator know metformin work level cell body act protein call CREB bind protein CBP . What investigator know process affect dose metformin increase change . Currently dose metformin often used child adult , possible dose metformin base age weight . Understanding CBP work could potentially help u tailor metformin treatment individually patient base age , weight CBP response .</brief_summary>
