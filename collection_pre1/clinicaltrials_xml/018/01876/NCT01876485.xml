	<brief_summary>This hybrid effectiveness/implementation trial conduct two phase four year . In Phase 1 , investigator evaluate process implement collaborative , diabetes goal-setting intervention ( Empowering Patients Chronic Care [ EPIC ] ) personalize self-reported patient activation functional health literacy ( FHL ) level routine primary care practice . In Phase 2 , investigator conduct randomize , clinical trial compare effectiveness EPIC enhance usual care ( EUC ) . In Phase 2 , investigator conduct randomize clinical trial enrol 284 Veterans poorly control diabetes define average hemoglobin A1c last six month &gt; = 8 % receive EPIC enhance usual care ( EUC ) .

	<detailed_description>Project Background : Diabetes mellitus highly prevalent chronic condition , affect one five Veterans use Veterans Affairs ( VA ) health care system . Self-management skill critical control diabetes reduce cardiovascular sequela . Providing diabetic patient effective self-management training support challenge due time constraint primary care encounter limit clinician training behavior change . The investigator previously demonstrate group-based , VA primary care intervention help patient set highly effective , evidence-based diabetes goal positive impact diabetes self-efficacy hemoglobin ( Hb ) A1c level . This study aim evaluate process implement collaborative goal-setting intervention personalize patient activation health literacy level ( i.e . Empowering Patients Chronic Care [ EPIC ] ) routine PACT care evaluate effectiveness intervention relative usual care . Project Objectives : Specific Aim 1 : Assess effective process cost associate implement collaborative diabetes goal-setting intervention personalize patient activation FHL ( i.e. , EPIC ) routine workflows PACTs . H1 : Formative measure within PARIHS framework ( evidence , context , facilitation ) associate implementation EPIC ( define reach , adoption , cost effectiveness , fidelity measure ) routine PACT care . Specific Aim 2 : Evaluate effectiveness deliver collaborative goal-setting personalize patient activation FHL clinical ( HbA1c ) patient-centered ( Diabetes Distress Scale ) outcomes among eligible patient enrol PACTs . H2 : Patients receive collaborative goal-setting personalize activation FHL level significant improvement ) HbA1c b ) Diabetes Distress Scale level , respectively , post-intervention compare patient receive enhance usual care . H3 : Patients receive collaborative goal-setting personalize activation FHL level maintain significant improvement ) HbA1c b ) Diabetes Distress Scale level post-maintenance follow-up , respectively , compare patient receive enhance usual care . Project Methods : In Phase 1 study , investigator implement EPIC routine PACT care . The investigator conduct mixed-methods formative evaluation include 33-48 key informant interview VA leadership , clinician , staff assessment organizational readiness change . This evaluation identify group one-on-one session EPIC best implement routine workflow PACT . In Phase 2 , investigator conduct randomize clinical trial enrol 284 patient poorly control diabetes define average hemoglobin A1c 8 % receive EPIC enhance usual care . The patient serve unit randomization . EPIC consist six 1-hour group session focus 1 ) Your Health , Your Values , 2 ) Diabetes ABCs , 3 ) Setting Goals Making Action Plans , 4 ) Communication Your Health Care Provider , 5 ) Staying Committed Your Goals , 6 ) Reviewing Planning Future . After group session , one-on-one session designate PACT member patient participant focus collaborative goal-setting . Designated PACT member train personalize goal-setting use patient-reported activation health literacy data . The investigator collect laboratory survey data baseline , post-intervention , post-maintenance phase . The investigator evaluate effectiveness personalize goal-setting compare enhance usual care clinical ( e.g. , hemoglobin A1c ) patient-centered ( e.g. , Diabetes Distress Scale ) outcomes .</detailed_description>
