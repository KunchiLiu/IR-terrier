	<detailed_description>Overactive bladder syndrome ( OAB ) , without urge incontinence , characterize urinary urgency , frequency nocturia . Thus , patient OAB could consider reduce quality life . Patients overactive bladder syndrome high risk fall fracture due nocturia . OAB affect around 17 % female population . At present , muscarinic receptor antagonists ﬁrst-line pharmacotherapeutic agent OAB . However , discontinuation treatment often result symptom relapse . Until , optimal duration treatment durability efﬁcacy determine . We plan use urodynamic study outcome evaluate therapeutic effect , change urinary nerve growth factor level . This study randomize prospective study , compare female OAB patient 3 month 6 month antimuscarinic treatment . The purpose study investigate difference urodynamic effect , therapeutic effect urinary urinary nerve growth factor level OAB females 3 month 6 month antimuscarinic treatment .</detailed_description>
