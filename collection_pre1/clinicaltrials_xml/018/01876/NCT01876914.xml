	<brief_summary>Diabetic Macular Edema ( DME ) , happen complication diabetes , occur fluid protein collect macula ( yellow central area retina ) . The fluid cause swell turn lead worsen central vision . The purpose study see study device ( Swept Source Optical Coherence Tomography SS-OCT ) able diagnose DME well already approve imaging procedure call fluorescein angiography ( FA ) . FA standard care would conduct regardless study participation . The dye use FA , cause allergic reaction patient use pregnant woman , need study device . Another purpose study avoid risk administer FA dye possible .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diabetic macular edema ( DME ) one common cause visual loss patient diabetes lead cause blindness work age population . In DME , excess fluid blood vessel retina leak macula , cause swell . Because macula responsible sharp central vision , swell cause blur distorted central vision , loss contrast sensitivity , include change color perception . A patient macular edema may may also ischemia , abnormal reduction blood flow retina due blockage retinal blood vessel . In macular ischemia , inadequate blood supply central retina result loss retinal cell function irreversible central vision loss . DME often treat focal laser application injection anti-vascular endothelial growth factor ( anti-VEGF ) drug eye stop leaky vessel . DME currently diagnose slit-lamp biomicroscopy optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) . Conventionally , OCT use assess edema ( retinal thickening fluid pocket ) . The initial assessment treatment planning also require assessment macular perfusion , currently do fluorescein angiography ( FA ) . FA use identify microaneurysms area capillary dropout ( ischemia ) , guide focal laser treatment help predict treatment response . Eyes great ischemia respond poorly treatment . FA require injection sodium fluorescein systemic circulation . However , 1 3 people adverse reaction sodium fluorescein , include nausea , vomit , hive , acute hypotension . Severe reaction anaphylaxis , cause cardiac arrest sudden death due anaphylactic shock , also report . Finally , risk sodium fluorescein develop fetus unknown , use pregnant woman contraindicate . Replacing FA less invasive well tolerate method would reduce risk patient population . One option OCT angiography . Optical coherence tomography image technology perform non-contact cross-sectional imaging tissue structure real time.It analogous ultrasound B-mode imaging , except OCT measure intensity reflect light rather acoustical wave . OCT number feature make attractive diagnostic imaging modality : 1 . ) It micron-level resolution , possible non-contact technique ; 2 . ) No potentially allergenic dye contrast agent require ; 3 . ) OCT image generate electronic form , facilitate use digital image processing technique extract quantitative parameter regard imaged tissue anatomy . For reason , structural OCT already routinely used ass area macular edema response treatment . Novel functional OCT include Doppler OCT OCT angiography may allow assessment retinal blood flow obviate need invasive FA test . Thus , diagnostic data provide functional OCT least equivalent superior achieve FA , patient healthcare provider could realize substantial benefit utilize technology management DME . To clarify , FA standard care procedure protocol , rather simply comparison conduct functional OCT FA .</detailed_description>
