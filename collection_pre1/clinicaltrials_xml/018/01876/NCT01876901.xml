	<brief_summary>Hypothesis : In France , approximately 12,000 new rectal cancer diagnose year . Frequency one half time high men woman . The average age diagnosis 65 . Unlike colon cancer , technical management remain challenge unresolved operating difficulty . Morbidity surgical procedure remain high large number preventive curative stoma derivation . Reference surgical treatment total excision rectum mesentery , follow continuity restoration immediate coloanal anastomosis ( ACAI ) . In procedure , rate fistula result report literature 15 25 % . An alternative ACAI delay coloanal anastomosis without reservoir ( ACAD ) . Based retrospective experience , form hypothesis ACAD offer much low rate fistula ( &lt; 5 % ) allow diminution preventive stoma derivation practice . Morbidity mortality reduce , patient 's quality life greatly improve . Direct cost ( consumables intraoperative , hospitalization , stoma complication ) indirect ( pocket-fitting stoma ) greatly reduce . This study multicentre , two arm , phase 2 clinical trial .</brief_summary>
