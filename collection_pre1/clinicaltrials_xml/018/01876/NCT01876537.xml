	<brief_summary>THEME RELEVANCE . Sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus disease ( SPD ) congenital disease 's well spread constitutes 1-2 % surgical pathology . In Coloproctological pathology , disease compose 14-20 % ( G.I . Vorobjov , 2006 ; V.D . Fedorov , 2005 ; Gupta P.J . et al. , 2005 ) . Clinical manifestation pilonidal sinus disease mainly due appearance inflammation . The main approach complex treatment group patient execute radical surgery . The guiding principle adequate sanation drainage purulent focus . Despite fact disease subject numerous medical journal , monograph , research work , master doctoral thesis , frequency unsatisfactory outcome remain high ( recurrence - 10 % 19 % , wound inflammation - 20-30 % ) . In case term stationary out-patient treatment increase till 30-70 day ( G.I . Vorobjov , 2006 ; B.M . Dacenko et al. , 2004 ; Cubukcu А. , 2001 , Perruchoud С , 2002 ) . The frequency unsatisfactory result excision SPD directly depend kind surgery . After palliative surgery ( incision drainage abscess ) 11.7 - 25.2 % patient occur recurrence disease ( McCallum I. , King P.M. , Bruce J. , 2007 ; ) , open wound heal recurrence occur 3-8 % operate . For primary wound heal 7,5-9,7 % require re-surgery ( V.K . An , 2003 ; A.A. Kartashev , 2011 ) . Sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus disease overwhelmingly affect people , mostly young work age , treatment failure lead long-term temporary disability patient . In last year continue discuss method one-time multi-stage radical surgical treatment pilonidal sinus , date single approach choice surgical treatment disease ( V.L . Denisenko , 2008 ) . Success surgical treatment SPD depend development introduction new device technique exist produce convergence immobilization wound edge , thereby obtain primary heal significant reduction wind surface . The high frequency disease postoperative complication , well long-term temporary disability patient demonstrate relevance development modern method radical surgery sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus disease ( V.I . Pomazkin , 2008 ) . AIM OF RESEARCH . The aim research improve result complex radical surgical treatment patient sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus disease development introduction new device technique convergence immobilization wound edge . TASKS OF RESEARCH . 1 . To conduct comparative analysis common surgical treatment SPD frequency complication intra- postoperative period . 2 . To develop device convergence immobilization wound edge patient SPD . 3 . To analyze effectiveness develop technique device comparison traditional surgical treatment . 4 . To make practical recommendation option method use develop method device . NOVELTY OF RESEARCH . For first time , base design creation approximation-immobilization device ( RU Patent № 112020 , Bull . № 1 , 01.10.2012 ) improve surgical treatment patient pathology , clinical anatomical study propose device different configuration gluteal-sacrococcygeal region , well analysis justification basic parameter wind ( length , depth width wound , number stitch , complication rate , area wound ) . Developed method closure wound defect radical excision pilonidal sinus Krivonosov-Brezhnev ( RU Patent № 2,464,943 , Bull . № 30 10.27.12 . ) , significantly reduce risk postoperative complication patient acute inflammation SPD . For first time analysis postoperative period patient operate propose method compare traditional method surgery perform . POSSIBLE APPLICATION AREAS . Results research design use treatment process coloproctological department level , well learn process medical school . EXPECTED EFFECTIVENESS . 1 . Scientific technical effect : developed new technique device convergence immobilization wound edge use treatment patient SPD . 2 . Medical social effect : introduction clinical practice develop technique device improve result surgical treatment patient SPD rigid fixation wound edge , reduce time postoperative wound healing , decrease risk complication early postoperative period .</brief_summary>
