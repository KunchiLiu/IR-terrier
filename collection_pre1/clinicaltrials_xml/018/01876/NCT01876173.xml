	<brief_summary>Sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) due ventricular arrhythmia serious cause cardiovascular death Canada . The implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) offer high-risk patient treatment option reduce incidence SCD deliver internal shock restore normal rhythm , need . Definitive evidence establish effectiveness ICD reduce mortality use prophylaxis SCD ( primary prevention indication ) . Approximately 3,700 new candidate accrue annually . Practice guideline define criterion determine patient ICD candidacy primary prevention . However , addition SCD risk , ICD candidate may chronic disease diabetes , renal insufficiency , hypertension , atrial fibrillation . Thus , balance benefit risk ICD become complex , particularly compete mortality risk present . Research recognize human cost associate device complication shock affect psychological , health relate quality life ( HRQL ) , morbidity outcome . The complexity surround long-term benefits/risks , complication , replacement , shock , warrant decision support prepare patient make decision . In Canada , clear framework support patient ' decision-making context ICD treatment option . Decision support , use decision aid , could moderate treatment related uncertainty prepare patient make active , inform , quality decision . Objectives : 1 ) develop decision aid ICD candidate support quality decision-making ( inform , deliberate , values-based choice ) , 2 ) evaluate decision aid , 3 ) determine feasibility conduct trial .</brief_summary>
