	<brief_summary>Clinical pharmacy specialist ideal position assist medical team management patient ischemic stroke . Given extensive specialize knowledge regard medication efficacy , safety , cost-effective use well ability critically review , interpret apply result clinical study patient care , clinical pharmacy specialist potential significant impact stroke care delivery . There numerous opportunity clinical pharmacy specialist become extensively involved delivery care high-risk patient . However , to-date study demonstrate impact clinical pharmacy specialist outcomes patient stroke Stroke third lead cause death United States ( U.S. ) common life-threatening neurologic disorder.1 Stroke lead cause long-term disability result significant individual societal financial burden . In 2006 , stroke account 1 every 18 death ischemic stroke account 87 % strokes.1 In U.S. , approximately 795,000 people develop stroke year , approximately 185,000 ( 23 % ) recurrent events.1 After first year , average annual risk recurrent stroke 4 % .2 Patients survive least 30 day first-ever stroke , average annual risk death 9.1 % , much risk due nonstroke cardiovascular disease . Despite evidence support use various therapeutic intervention within ischemic stroke population , significant proportion patient continue uncontrolled risk factor remain undertreated.26-30 A recent prospective study 4933 high-risk patient report , compare patient coronary artery disease , patient cerebrovascular disease undertreated thus less likely achieve blood pressure ( 45.3 % vs. 57.3 % ; p &lt; 0.001 ) lipid ( 19.4 % vs. 30.5 % ; p &lt; 0.001 ) targets.28 Although reason so-called `` treatment gap '' explore specifically within population , data study within coronary artery disease population suggest provider , patient health care system factor likely contribute . This first , prospective , randomize study evaluate impact clinical pharmacist disease management program surrogate clinical outcome patient non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke . This randomize , control study compare clinical pharmacist-led disease management intervention Clinical Pharmacy Cardiac Risk Service ( CPCRS ) usual care ( UC ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Evaluation Clinical Pharmacist-led Intervention Clinical Outcomes Patients With Ischemic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim 1 : Conduct randomize , control , study clinical pharmacist-led disease management intervention patient history non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke compare usual care . Hypothesis 1a : More patient clinical pharmacy specialist-led disease management group achieve lipid blood pressure goal compare `` Usual Care '' group . Hypothesis 1b : Fewer patient randomize clinical pharmacy specialist-led disease management group recurrent cardiovascular event death compare patient `` usual care '' group . Hypothesis 1c : More patient ischemic stroke receive appropriate secondary prevention care use evidence-based medication intervention group compare usual care . All patient ICD-9 code 430.XX 438.XX administratively identify start January 1 , 2000 administratively pull HealthTrac®-Stroke registry . Each patient include registry undergo validation process ensure stroke type event date accurate . Staff CPCRS manually review electronic medical record patient registry ensure ICD-9 code stroke accurate accord detailed procedure ( Appendix I ) . Patients history indicate transient ischemic attack , subarachnoid hemorrhage , intracerebral hemorrhage , cardioembolic stroke cod `` TIA '' `` Hemorrhage '' `` Cardioembolic '' stroke , respectively , registry eligible study screen entry . Patients consider ischemic stroke documentation medical record , hospital discharge summary otherwise , indicate patient symptom consistent stroke , example limit sudden numbness weakness face , arm leg , especially one side body , sudden confusion , trouble speak understanding , sudden trouble see one eye , sudden trouble walking , dizziness , loss balance coordination , sudden , severe headache know cause ) and/or imaging ( MRI CT scan ) clinically relevant brain lesion documentation physician note patient stroke.12 It estimate approximately 5200 patient validate stroke , 4200 ischemic stroke ( cardioembolic non-cardioembolic ) approximately 2500 non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke . All eligible patient validate non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke diagnosis HealthTrac®-Stroke registry screen study eligibility study personnel . Intervention ( CPCRS ) Group : The intervention utilize clinical pharmacy specialist CPCRS . The intervention similar apply patient CAD . CPCRS ensure patient regular laboratory monitoring ( i.e . lipid ) blood pressure measure , initiate appropriate lipid-lowering antihypertensive medication , receive follow-up timely manner . CPCRS staff order evidence-based lipid-lowering and/or antihypertensive medication , adjust dos , order follow-up laboratory parameter , necessary pre-approved regional treatment protocol Patients monitor medication adherence adverse effect . Patients receive dietary , exercise , smoke cessation counsel verbally mail pre-printed Kaiser Permanente approve , patient education pamphlet , necessary per discretion clinical pharmacy specialist . Patients require intensive dietary counseling refer appropriate resource offer KPCO . Primary care provider inform medication initiation dosage adjustment . The primary mode communication CPCRS patient via telephone e-mail kp.org . Usual Care : Patients randomize Usual Care continue receive interventions/procedures normally receive accord standard/usual care practice . Follow-up Laboratories Blood Pressure Values : Letters mail subject Intervention group remind him/her appropriate laboratory complete , necessary , use standard CPCRS letter . Patients fail laboratory draw 2 mailed reminder letter separate 1-month mark `` noncompliant '' database receive reminder every 6 month thereafter . For patient Usual Care group , reminder letter send . However assessment lipid blood pressure control 3 year ( primary outcome ) group , reminder letter mail , necessary . All patient follow 3 year randomization first occurrence KPCO termination date , cardiovascular event , death .</detailed_description>
