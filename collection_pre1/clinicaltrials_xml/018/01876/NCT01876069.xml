	<brief_summary>Background : Pancreatic cancer associate poor prognosis . Therefore , rapid accurate diagnosis pancreatic mass important direct patient management . Endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration ( EUS-FNA ) current standard sample pancreatic mass lesion , diagnostic accuracy 78 % 95 % . But , EUS-FNA limitation include stromal cell tumor lymphomas may difficult diagnose . To overcome limitation , new needle device ProCore reverse-bevel technology develop recently . Aims : The objective prospective study compare rate diagnostic sufficiency EUS sample use newly develop ProCore needle conventional FNA needle suspect unresectable pancreatic cancer . We also compare safety , yield histologic core tissue cost-effectiveness modality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Newly Developed PreCore Needle With Conventional Fine Needle Suspected Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patient : Newly diagnose pancreatic cancer patient whose cancer lesion suspect unresectable diagnostic imaging CT MRI Procedure : Each EUS-guided FNA ProCore aspiration perform twice patient . The priority order give randomization assignment . The number patient require : Total sixty five patient require .</detailed_description>
