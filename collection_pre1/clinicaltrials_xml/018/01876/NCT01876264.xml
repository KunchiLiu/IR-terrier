	<brief_title>Crohn 's Extent Resection Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct randomise control trial . The patient blind procedure undertaken , endoscopist perform 6 month post operative colonoscopy . It possible blind operating team , obvious reason . Patients undergo elective urgent ileocolic resection , primary redo resection , invite participate trial . Randomisation take place operate theatre conventional ileocolic resection perform . Those patient randomise modest resection ( 10cm margin ) additional 8cm distal small bowel resect prior formation surgical anastomosis . All patient see colorectal clinic approximately 6 week post operatively routine follow appointment , current practice . A colonoscopy perform 6 month post operatively assess anastomosis , keep current practice . Any additional follow discretion colorectal gastroenterological team , keep clinical practice . Patients recruit trial additional ongoing follow directly relate trial participation . At 5 year follow recruitment patient , medical note review identify patient symptomatic recurrence , surgery assess duration medication-free interval follow surgery . Performing colonoscopy 6 month post operatively assess appearance surgical anastomosis ass primary endpoint . This perform senior gastroenterological trainee consultant gastroenterologist familiar assessment post operative Crohn 's disease Rutgeert 's score . The appearance anastomosis score , biopsy take around anastomosis ass microscopic change . The use Rutgeert 's score widely accept gastroenterological community standard assessment tool post operative anastomotic disease recurrence patient Crohn 's disease . The duration medication-free interval follow resection assess review medical note . This clinically relevant patient , previously show quality life improve patient take regular medication . The duration symptom-free interval assess review medical note . This clinically relevant patient , abdominal symptom pain bloat significantly deleterious effect quality life . The duration time reoperation Crohn 's disease recurrence surgical anastomosis assess clinical note . This relevance patient population well medical community . Crohn 's disease commonly recur , necessitate surgery . Multiple operation result resection bowel result reduction length bowel available absorption nutrient food . Ultimately , patient may develop short bowel syndrome . This require total parenteral nutrition , associate risk carry , may require small bowel transplantation .</detailed_description>
