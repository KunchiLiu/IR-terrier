	<brief_title>Brief Culturally Adapted Cognitive Behavior Therapy Psychosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND A number systematic review meta-analyses ( example , Wykes , Steel , Everitt , &amp; Tarrier , 2008 ) conclude Cognitive Behaviour Therapy ( CBT ) effective treat people schizophrenia . Most work however , conduct West . In literature search study CBT psychosis English language literature find low middle income country , include Pakistan . Only two study psychological intervention schizophrenia find Pakistan ( Farooq et al. , 2011 ; Nasr , Kausar , &amp; others , 2009 ) . It suggest cultural difference influence process Cognitive Behaviour Psychotherapy , therefore therapy might need adapt cultural need give country . Our group adapt Cognitive Therapy depression Pakistan ( F. Naeem , Ayub , Gobbi , &amp; Kingdon , 2009 ; F. Naeem , Gobbi , Ayub , Kingdon , &amp; others , 2010 ; Farooq Naeem , Ayub , Kingdon , &amp; Gobbi , 2012 ; Farooq Naeem , Gobbi , Ayub , &amp; Kingdon , 2009 ) , find effective small trial ( Farooq Naeem , Waheed , Gobbi , Ayub , &amp; Kingdon , 2011 ) . Same methodology use adapt CBT schizophrenia local use ( Naeem et al , review ) . A small pilot find effective inpatient setting . ( Habib et al , review ) . This RCT test effectiveness Culturally adapt CBT psychosis ( CaCBTp ) . METHODS Aims The aim RCT test brief culturally adapt Cognitive Therapy Schizophrenia Treatment As Usual Pakistan .

The exclusion criterion include ; - co-morbid alcohol substance dependence - organic brain syndrome learn disability - high level disturb behavior/or high risk suicide homicide . Sample size The sample size calculate show difference post-treatment PANSS positive symptom score group . A previous study ( reference ? ) find standard deviation post-treatment score 5.8 control group , 1.8 CBT group . In analysis , pre-treatment score adjust , previous study find correlation 0.2 pre post treatment score . A difference group 15 % pre-treatment value would regard clinical importance . This equate difference 3 unit PANNS positive symptom score scale . Using 5 % significance level 90 % power , calculate 41 subject per group require , 82 total . It expect 30 % patient may drop-out study . To allow , total 120 patient recruit study . Procedure Mental health professional hospital contact purpose study explain . Patients refer receive information study . After take informed consent participant assess blind assessor psychology graduate receive one day train use assessment tool .

The test test reliability PANSS 0.88 Criterion relate validity 0.62 . The Structured Clinical Interview PANSS ( SCI-PANSS ) ( Kay , 1991 ) use study . Psychotic Symptom Rating Scales ( PSYRATS ) ( Gillian Haddock , McCarron , Tarrier , &amp; Faragher , 1999 ) 17 item interviewer score instrument consist 2 subscales ( PSYRATS Voice , PSYRAT Delusion ) measure severity number dimension auditory hallucination delusion include amount intensity distress associate symptom . The 11 item hallucination sub-scale consist item frequency , duration , loudness , negative content , intensity distress degree disruption . The six item delusion sub-scale ( PSYRATS delusion ) consist item amount pre-occupation , degree conviction , intensity distress disruption . All item rat five point scale increase severity ( 0 = No problem 4 = Maximum severity ) . The PSYRATS demonstrate good inter rater reliability ( intra class correlation ( ICCS ) item &gt; .90 ) , test test reliability ( ICCS subscales = .70 ) , concurrent validity , sensitivity change patient diagnose Schizophrenia . Insight rat use Schedule Assessment Insight ( SAI ) ( David , Buchanan , Reed , &amp; Almeida , 1992 ) . The SAI rate three dimension insight ; Treatment Adherence ( SAI-TA ) , Recognition Illness ( SAI-RI ) Symptom Relabelling ( SAI-SR ) . Symptom Relabelling involves recognition psychotic symptom understand pathological event . Each dimension comprise two three question score 3-point scale 0 ( insight ) 2 ( good insight ) , maximum total score 24 . The sub-scale total sum total insight score . Brief disability rating questionnaire use measure change level disability . Intervention The CBT intervention consist 6 session session last approximately one hour . There one additional session family . It observe family member involve actively patient care Pakistan , main carer/family member involve treatment plan begin . A key carer identify researcher work close collaboration . This person help homework require . The session plan accord manualized treatment protocol ( Kingdon &amp; Turkington , 1994 ) . Therapy deliver use guideline develop cultural adaptation Pakistan therapist receive regular supervision skype .

Initial analysis compare two group carry use test Ï‡2 test . A linear regression analysis use , end therapy dependent variable group allocation , independent variable . In order see effect baseline difference pre treatment score effect therapy second analysis carry baseline score enter independent variable addition treatment group ( i.e. , dependent variable post treatment score , independent variable treatment group pre treatment score ) .</detailed_description>
