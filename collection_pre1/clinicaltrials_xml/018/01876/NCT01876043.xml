	<brief_summary>Liposarcomas soft tissue sarcoma frequent . We distinguish three subtypes basis histological cytogenetic characteristic : well-differentiated liposarcoma / dedifferentiate , myxoid liposarcoma / round cell liposarcoma pleomorphic . Dedifferentiated liposarcoma ( LDD ) represent 20 % liposarcomas characterize well-differentiated component associate contingent sarcomatous differentiation fat-usually high grade . The LDD often rétropértionéal seat . Thus , development long asymptomatic . At diagnosis , tumor volume often important make surgical removal impossible high proportion case . Operable tumor also risk local recurrence 50 % 20 % metastatic . Chemotherapy treatment advance form . However , currently available drug ( adriamycin , ifosfamide ) limit effectiveness . Progression-free survival patient exceed 2 month . The LDD characterize cytogenetically constant presence two amplicons ( 1p32 6q23 ) respectively target gene MAP3K5 JUN . These two gene encode protein involve signal pathway Jun N-terminal kinase ( JNK ) . Activation JNK involve loss adipose differentiation tumor aggressiveness LDD . The plitidepsin drug capable induce apoptosis tumor cell carry functional activation JNK pathway . This drug pro-apoptotic anti-proliferative vitro model LDD . plitidepsin could represent treatment choice patient advance LDD . The objective study evaluate anti-tumor activity plitidepsin patient locally advance dedifferentiated liposarcoma / metastatic .</brief_summary>
