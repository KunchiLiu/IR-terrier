	<brief_summary>Neuroendocrine tumour ( NETs ) rare , slow growing , diagnosis often delay advanced metastasis presentation . In select patient population , radioisotope therapy show safe effective palliative therapy . Lutetium-177 ( Lu-DOTA-TATE ) use Cross Cancer Institute treat 91 patient NETS since August , 2010 . This study do investigator Lu-DOTA-TATE treatment currently give Health Canada 's ( HC ) Special Access Programme ( SAP ) , individual treatment require separate approval . HC request investigator conduct clinical trial Lu-DOTA-TATE , goal receive approval use Lu-DOTA-TATE market treatment agent . There two group subject : Group A ( primary therapy ) somatostatin receptor positive tumour ; Group B ( secondary therapy ) subject currently provide Lu-DOTA-TATE SAP . All subject treat therapeutic stage use 8-12 week dose 4 cycle follow maintenance stage use dose 22 26 week interval 8 cycle 22 26 week follow last dose . Safety assess vital sign , blood work , renal function adverse event collection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Assess Safety Effectiveness Lutetium-177 Octreotate Therapy Neuroendocrine Tumours</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A major group somatostatin receptor positive tumour neuroendocrine origin ( NETs ) , comprise spectrum rare ( &lt; 5 % ) neoplasms derive primitive neuroectodermal tissue . Because neoplasms grow slowly symptoms common general population , diagnosis often delay advanced metastasis presentation . Radiopharmaceuticals label Lutetium-177 report effective therapeutic agent population patient , use extensively group Europe , particular Dr. Krenning 's group University Rotterdam . The peptide DOTA0-tyr3-octreotate ( DOTATATE ) grant orphan drug status USA Europe . Dr. Krenning et al publish data 300 patient , demonstrate safety effectiveness treatment . They show stable disease , minimal , partial complete response 80 % patient treat Lutetium-177 octreotate . They also show comparable response rate term improvement symptoms quality life . Coupled relatively benign safety profile investigator believe treatment offer realization significant objective disease burden reduction improvement quality life symptomatic relief NET subject intend benefit demonstrate study . The Lu-DOTA-TATE use study provide Edmonton Radiopharmaceutical Centre . The radiopharmaceutical manufacture compliance Health Canada requirement batch meet approve quality control specification .</detailed_description>
