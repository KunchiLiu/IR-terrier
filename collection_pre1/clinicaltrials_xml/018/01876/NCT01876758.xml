	<detailed_description>The investigator propose enroll 60 patient schedule undergo ECT course 3 year . They randomly assign one three research condition ( ) participants Mem-ECT condition receive memory training ECT course , ( b ) participant active control condition work commercially available puzzle game times prior ECT determine develop memory training program effective mere mental stimulation , ( c ) participants `` treatment usual '' work memory train puzzle game undergo study evaluation . Participants evaluate day ECT , within 2 week follow ECT , 2 month later . The evaluation consist interview , mental skill test , measure brain wave use electroencephalograph ( EEG ) ECT 2 month ECT ( EEG right ECT ) . It hope develop safe effective strategy minimize adverse memory side effect ECT make ECT good easily tolerate treatment patient severe depression need therapeutic option .</detailed_description>
