	<brief_summary>This study aim determine efficacy safety tourniquet reinflation early tourniquet release total knee arthroplasty , compare method early deflation without reinflation . The investigator hypothesize reinflation early release tourniquet would effective term improve visualization surgical field decrease operation time blood loss , whereas would increase tourniquet-related complication due long tourniquet-use time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Reinflation After Early Tourniquet Release Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) mostly perform tourniquet apply , allow decrease intraoperative blood loss , good visualization surgical field well cement fixation implant , compare TKA without use tourniquet . However , remain controversy time tourniquet release , tourniquet may unreleased throughout whole operation time release early cement fixation implant , atc . Early tourniquet release generally aim control hide arterial bleeding would reveal tourniquet unreleased . This method report reduce arterial bleeding related complication , also know increase intraoperative bleeding , incidence transfusion , operation time . On hand , late tourniquet release , tourniquet unreleased wound close , report increase tourniquet-use time related complication owe longer tourniquet time , although give short operation time . The investigator use way reinflation tourniquet early release , arterial bleeding control sufficiently , balance advantage disadvantage early tourniquet release . The investigator able control arterial bleeding time tourniquet release , remain procedure perform conveniently good visualization surgical field tourniquet reinflated . However , previous study efficacy safety way reinflation early release tourniquet literature . Therefore , investigator ask study whether reinflation early tourniquet release advantage method early tourniquet release without reinflation , term efficacy safety .</detailed_description>
