	<brief_title>Effect Fluvoxamine Cognition , Behavior , Symptoms mRNA Protein Expression Schizophrenia Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical study show add selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) antidepressants antipsychotic improve negative symptom schizophrenia patient unresponsive antipsychotic alone . The effect SSRI augmentation cognitive impairment illness respond antipsychotic associated poor outcome adequately test . In recent study show SSRI augmentation alters expression gamma-aminobutyric acid ( GABA A ) receptor , protein kinase ( PKC ) , brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) relate system peripheral mononuclear blood cell ( PMC ) schizophrenia patient . There evidence system abnormal schizophrenia patient associate cognitive negative symptom strengthen likelihood modulation SSRI augmentation improve cognitive impairment . Behavioral disturbance , particularly aggression another feature schizophrenia difficult treat lead social legal complication poor outcome . Aggression associate serotoninergic dysfunction evidence SSRI modify aggressive behavior include schizophrenia patient .Thus study also examine effect SSRI augmentation aggressive behavior behavioral functional measure . The mechanism SSRI augmentation know focus research interest . We recently show laboratory study combine treatment SSRI antidepressant antipsychotic drug result biochemical change , different effect individual medication . Changes unique combine treatment find GABAergic component related system include GABA-Aβ3 receptor , glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 PKCβ select area rat brain culture cortical neuron . Studies drug mechanism human utilized blood product PMC readily accessible may reflect molecular process central nervous system ( CNS ) schizophrenic patient .Using method schizophrenia patient treat SSRI augmentation show change mRNA encode GABA A receptor , PKC relate protein associate clinical improvement indicating change observe laboratory clinical relevance . Methods The dose antipsychotic unchanged least 2 week prior study remain steady throughout study period . Fluvoxamine 100mg/day add treatment regimen continue 6 week . Clinical state assess use validate rating scale cognitive performance assess cognitive test battery . Behavior function , include assessed appropriate scale Blood sample take baseline 1 , 3 6 weeks.At end study protocol ( 6 week ) patient give option continue receive fluvoxamine . It assume included subject would receive fluvoxamine n't participation study lack indication primary diagnosis ( see inclusion criterion ) . The PMC 's assayed use microarray , ( PCR ) polymerase chain reaction proteomic technique . Changes RNA protein expression detect compare change clinical symptom , cognitive function behavioral change . Identification biochemical change relate augmentation treat relation symptomatic cognitive change major potential benefit study . Subjects 40 chronic schizophrenic schizoaffective patient ( DSM-IVTR ) persistent negative symptom cognitive impairment despite adequate treatment participate . The sample include patient history aggressive behavior hospitalize forensic ward well patient regular hospital ward outpatient setting . Assessments The diagnosis determine consensus two senior psychiatrist use DSM-IVTR criterion . Physical assessment ( include physical examination well measurement blood pressure pulse ) take patient 's medical record prior commencement study . Background demographic characteristic , detail present illness , medication , general medical history current laboratory test also evaluate . Clinical state cognitive function assess prior fluvoxamine treatment study period accord flow sheet . Clinical assessment scale include : Schedule Assessment Negative Symptoms ( SANS ) ; Schedule Assessment Positive Symptoms ( SAPS ) ; Simpson Angus Scale Extrapyramidal Side Effects ; Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scales ( AIMS ) ; Calgary Depression Scale Cognitive assessment include : Mini Mental State Examination , Dot test , Digit Span , Finger Tap Test modify , Wechsler memory test . Computerized Cognitive Neuropsychological Battery : Computerized judgment line orientation ( CJOLO ) ; Penn face memory test ( PFMT ) ; Visual object learn test ( VOLT ) ; Abstraction inhibition work memory task ( AIM ) , Identification facial emotion ( PEAT ) ; Differentiation facial emotion ( EMDIF ) . Behavioral function assessment Overt aggression Scale GAF ( DSM IV TR ) Critical Events Blood test Approx 50cc blood take baseline , prior start fluvoxamine treatment , 1,3 6 week start fluvoxamine treatment . Treatment blood sample : Blood collect heparinized tube , keep ice transport laboratory . Blood sample process enable assay PMC elements interest , include chemokine receptor , G protein receptor GABAA receptor , regulator , PKC GSK3 RGS7 neurotrophins BDNF . Some serum frozen subsequent analyse antipsychotic drug neurohormone concentration . The blood sample store molecular neuropsychiatry laboratory Technion Institute Technology ( Haifa ) supervision principal investigator , Prof. Henry Silver . The sample unnamed number . They keep maximum 10 year . The participant give option ask destruction sample time . Flow sheet Week 0 Subject entry Clinical assessment Cognitive Assessment Behavioral Assessment Blood collection- baseline Start Fluvoxamine Week 1 Blood collection Week 3 Clinical assessment Cognitive assessment Behavioral Assessment Blood collection Week 6 Clinical assessment Cognitive assessment Behavioral Assessment Blood collection Implementation protocol The implementation protocol involve team research clinicians Sha'ar Menashe Mental Health Center ( Hadera ) well Technion Institute Technology ( Haifa ) direction principal investigator , Prof. Henry Silver . Clinical cognitive rating respectively obtain one rater order eliminate inter-rater bias . Statistical analysis Statistical analysis study parameter do repeat measure use analysis variance ( ANOVA ) t-test . For nonparametric distribution Mann Whitney U test chi test utilize . Risk/Benefit Safety Considerations The take blood sample invasive procedure . This routine procedure accompany minor discomfort . Fluvoxamine augmentation study extensively use safely numerous study . Side effect fluvoxamine include nausea GI disturbance . The side effect determine clinical assessment week 0,3 6 accord flow sheet use clinical interview well physical examination necessary . The side effect document study protocol . Severe adverse event monitor treat physician report team research clinician . The major advance methodology enable detection RNA protein change PMC assign subject his/her control , enable change clinical state relate biochemical change . Thus , direct potential benefit participant study would improvement cognitive , behavioral ( include aggressive ) clinical symptom , consequently improve potential well rehabilitation major potential benefit society would identification molecular change accompany clinical response SSRI augmentation basis understand pharmacological mechanism action consequently open new vista treatment future .</detailed_description>
