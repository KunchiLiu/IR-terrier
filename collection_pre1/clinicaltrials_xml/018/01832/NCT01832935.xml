	<detailed_description>This randomize double blind control clinical trial 12months subject type 2 diabetes . Two hundred diabetic subject , 18-65 year age , include study . Subjects willing initiate insulin therapy A1C &gt; 8.0 % . Any current prior medication acceptable participant inclusion type insulin evaluate . Demographic anthropometric variable record . Paraclinical data include glucose lipid profile measure every three months.In addition , quality life assess self-administered standard EQ-5D questionnaire . Subjects exclude follow criterion : Alteration insulin sensitivity major surgery , infection , renal failure ( Glomerular Filtration Rate &lt; 50 ) , glucocorticoid treatment , recent ( within 2 week ) serious hypoglycemic episode ( require assistance another ) , simultaneous participate another clinical study , use type insulin , sight hearing impaired , active proliferative retinopathy maculopathy require treatment within 6 month prior screen , breast feeding , pregnancy nursing intention become pregnant use adequate contraceptive measure . Participants recruit July 2011 October 2012 . They randomly allocate two group use simple randomization method The insulin therapy prescribe physician clinic . The start dose insulin Glargine 24 unit per day ( 0.2-0.6 unit/kg ) 2 divide dos intervention group . The control group receive NPH/Reg insulin ( 2:1 ) initiation dose 0.2-0.6 unit/kg 2 divide doses.Two-thirds dose give breakfast remainder dinner . In study , insulin analogue use accordance license approval local regulatory authority . Changes OGLDs time start insulin analogue , thereafter , entirely discretion participant physician . Paraclinical data measure referral laboratory every three month . Trial visit define 0 , 12 , 24 , 36 48 week baseline . All participant ask record 7-point blood glucose value three consecutive day visit . Seven-point self-monitoring blood glucose include three pre-meals , three post-meals , bedtime blood glucose value day.Insulin dos adjust titration regimen accord self-monitored blood glucose.For group , treatment goal follow : fasting blood glucose 80-120 mg/dl , postprandial glucose &lt; 160 mg/dl , A1C &lt; 7 % We collect medical cost patient checklist . All patient ask attend clinic every one month study . Clinical event hospital episode also related cost determine visit . Any pharmaceutical , laboratory/diagnostic rehabilitative care , well contact specialist , general practitioner , nurse , optician , podiatrist , dietician record patient with/without complication.Finally total cost calculate . Direct nonmedical cost : Any service transportation patient family clinic take care dependent assess non-medical expenditure patient self-estimate questionnaire . Indirect cost : The lost productivity cost due health problem diabetes determine day absent work , poor work performance , low earnings capacity disability , mortality . We calculate number day visit could present job diabetes related health care . The average net hourly wage ask patient . For unemployed patient , consider average wage population economically active employment . Lost earnings owe premature mortality define mortality cost . Costs health provider perspective , convert Iranian Rials ( IRR ) USA dollar ( USD ) official exchange rate 12,260 IRR/1USD 2012 international comparison ( Central Bank Iran ) .</detailed_description>
