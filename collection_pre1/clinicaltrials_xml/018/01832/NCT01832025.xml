	<brief_summary>Sinus augmentation , also refer sinus lift sinus graft , oral surgery procedure bone add upper jaw near molar . The goal surgery add enough bone material onto upper jaw support placement dental implant . The augmentation dental implant placement do time avoid need two surgery . This standard care . The purpose study compare problem patient comfort level follow surgery . Subjects randomly place one two group : internal lift group external lift group . Both type surgery routinely do clinic . Usually type procedure ( internal external ) base dentist 's preference . Investigators study compare see one comfortable subject equal . It predict two technique may differ come complication procedure , patient discomfort follow procedure patient complication week month procedure . This last comparison yet study , surgeon often choose technique prefer experience . With research study researcher hope gain valuable information help surgeon ' decision future . - Investigators hypothesize external sinus augmentation simultaneous implant placement ( external technique ) high rate Schneiderian membrane perforation internal sinus augmentation simultaneous implant placement ( internal technique ) . - Investigators hypothesize internal technique associate discomfort subject compare external technique . - Investigators hypothesize external technique result severe pain/bleeding/swelling internal technique . - Investigators hypothesize internal technique high incidence complication occur three week three month postoperatively compare external technique . - Investigators hypothesize external technique high amount analgesic take postoperatively compare internal technique</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Experimental Design The propose study design single site , double arm , randomized clinical trial . Subjects whose diagnosis require restore lateral maxillary edentulous area perform sinus augmentation together implant placement . Sample Size Statistical Analysis Sample size A number 46 subject , 23 per group , meet study inclusion exclusion criterion , treat study allow dropout rate 15 % . Up 60 subject consent reach research goal 46 . The sample size determine use nQuery program ( version 7.0 ) - power 80 % 20 subjects/group , assume anticipated value Schneiderian membrane rate perforation 55 % ( 8 ) external procedure 10 % internal procedure ( 9 ) , base previously report study procedure . Randomization Randomization perform 1:1 ratio use balance design base computer-generated randomization scheme . A printout scheme use co-investigator randomization subject qualifies order qualification . Randomization occur day surgery . Blinding Due nature procedure , study blind . Subject Characteristics Subjects include patient whose diagnosis require restore lateral maxillary edentulous area perform sinus augmentation together implant placement .</detailed_description>
