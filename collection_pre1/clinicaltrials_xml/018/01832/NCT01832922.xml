	<detailed_description>This non-randomized open label dose-ranging study Bendamustine Rituximab ( BR ) patient previously untreated relapsed/refractory CLL multiple comorbidities ( Cumulative Illness Rating Scale [ CIRS ] ≥7 ) without renal insufficiency ( estimate creatinine clearance [ CrCL ] 15-40 mL/min , receive dialysis ) . The study accrue two independent patient cohort . Both cohort follow standard 3+3 Phase I design . Once maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) determine , two expansion cohort enrol . Dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) assess 1st cycle treatment . Patients CLL significant comorbidities ( CIRS≥7 ; least one category grade 3-4 ) , without minor renal dysfunction ( CrCL &gt; 40 mL/min ) accrue onto Cohort 1 study . At dose level 1 , patient receive bendamustine 45 mg/m2 combination rituximab ( 375 mg/m2 cycle 1 500 mg/m2 subsequent cycle ) . If safe , dose bendamustine escalate 70 mg/m2 ( dose level 2 ) . By contrast , dose de-escalation 25 mg/m2 ( dose level -1 ) occur cohort DLT 's encountered dose level 1 . Once MTD determine expansion cohort accrue dose level allow assessment DLT 's subsequent cycle . Because bendamustine formally study patient renal failure due potential increase frequency toxic event patient , patient significant renal dysfunction ( CrCL 15-40 mL/min , receive dialysis ) accrue Cohort 2 . DLT 's 0/3 ( ≤1/6 ) subject renal dysfunction dose level 1 ( ) permit continue accrual subject onto expansion cohort ( N=10 ) . If unacceptable toxicity encounter , bendamustine dose reduce 25 mg/m2 ( dose level -1 ) , follow expansion cohort safe ( 10 patient ) . Dose escalation allow cohort . Accrual patient cohort occur simultaneously ( see Schema ) take place two center : ambulatory Hematology Clinics Norris Cotton Cancer Center ( NCCC ) Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center ( DHMC ) , Lebanon , NH ( Lead [ Dartmouth ] Principal Investigator [ Lead PI ] - Alexey Danilov M.D. , Ph.D. ) , CLL Center Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ( DFCI ) , Boston , MA ( DFCI Principal Investigator [ DFCI PI ] - Jennifer Brown M.D. , Ph.D. ) .
