	<brief_summary>The area around tumor ( `` pre-metastatic niche '' ) may area cancer cell attract . The study doctor take blood tumor sample look certain feature link response treatment predict future patient may benefit therapy . The purpose study see drug pazopanib use reduce amount pre-metastatic niche patient 's lymph node ( common site prostate cancer spread ) . Down line , may help prevent prostate cancer come back surgery .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Men ≥ 18 year age Histological documentation adenocarcinoma prostate , available biopsy pathology . Biopsy material must available pathologic review . All patient must meet one follow disease feature : clinical stage great equal T3 ; Primary Gleason score 4 OR Gleason score 8 , 9 10 ; serum PSA ( prostatespecific antigen ) ≥ 20 ng/mL ; Prostate MRI finding consistent T3 disease ; Any clinical stage PSA ( prostatespecific antigen ) &gt; 10 Gleason score 7 ; A Kattan nomogram predict probability free biochemical progression 5 year surgery &lt; 60 % . Patients must PSA ( prostatespecific antigen ) ≥ 2 ng/mL time diagnosis prostate cancer later . No prior radiation chemotherapy prostate cancer treatment . Scheduled radical prostatectomy surgery . ECOG Performance Status 0 1 . Patients may treat 4 month androgen deprivation therapy . No clinical evidence metastatic prostate cancer , enlarge pelvic lymph node image study . Resected lymph node must provide subject biomarker analysis immediately ( day ) surgery ( radical prostatectomy ) . Adequate organ system function define study Protocol 1 . Subjects may transfusion within 7 day screen assessment . 2 . Concomitant elevation bilirubin AST/ALT ( aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ) 1.0 x ULN ( upper limit normal ) permit . 3 . If UPC ( urine protein count ) = &gt; 1 , 24hour urine protein must assess . Subjects must 24hour urine protein value &lt; 1 eligible . Subjects must provide write informed consent within one month prior performance studyspecific procedures assessment must willing comply treatment follow . Clinical evidence metastatic prostate cancer . Prior malignancy . No prior malignancy allow except follow : adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , adequately treated Stage I II cancer patient currently complete remission , cancer patient diseasefree 5 year . Clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormality may increase risk gastrointestinal bleeding include , limited : Active peptic ulcer disease Known intraluminal metastatic lesion/s risk bleed Inflammatory bowel disease ( e.g . ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease ) , gastrointestinal condition increase risk perforation History abdominal fistula , gastrointestinal perforation , intraabdominal abscess within 28 day prior begin study treatment . Clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormality may affect absorption investigational product include , limited : Malabsorption syndrome Major resection stomach small bowel . Corrected QT interval ( QTc ) &gt; 480 msecs Note : Correction method report History one follow cardiovascular condition within past 6 month : Cardiac angioplasty stenting Myocardial infarction Unstable angina Coronary artery bypass graft surgery Symptomatic peripheral vascular disease Class III IV congestive heart failure , define New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) No evidence preexist uncontrolled hypertension . If patient history elevate blood pressure baseline must control hypertension document confirm 2 consecutive blood pressure read take within 1 hour . The baseline systolic blood pressure reading must = &lt; 140 mm Hg , baseline diastolic blood pressure reading must = &lt; 90 mm Hg . Note : Initiation adjustment antihypertensive medication ( ) permit prior study entry . Following antihypertensive medication initiation adjustment , blood pressure ( BP ) must reassess three time approximately 2minute interval . At least 24 hour must elapse antihypertensive medication initiation adjustment Blood Pressure measurement . These three value average obtain mean diastolic blood pressure mean systolic blood pressure . The mean SBP / DBP ratio must &lt; 140/90 mm Hg ( OR 150/90 mm Hg , criterion approve HCI DSMC Chair Cochair ) order subject eligible study ( see protocol detail Blood Pressure control reassessment prior study enrollment ) . History cerebrovascular accident include transient ischemic attack ( TIA ) , pulmonary embolism untreated deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) within past 6 month . Major surgery trauma within 28 day prior first dose investigational product and/or presence nonhealing wound , fracture , ulcer ( procedure catheter placement consider major surgery ) . Evidence active bleeding bleed diathesis . Known endobronchial lesion and/or lesion infiltrate major pulmonary vessel increase risk pulmonary hemorrhage Note : Lesions infiltrate major pulmonary vessel ( contiguous tumour vessel ) exclude ; however , presence tumor touching , infiltrate ( abut ) vessel acceptable ( CT ( compute tomography ) contrast strongly recommend evaluate lesion ) . Large protrude endobronchial lesion main lobar bronchus exclude ; however , endobronchial lesion segment bronchus allow . Lesions extensively infiltrate main lobar bronchus exclude ; however , minor infiltration wall bronchus allow . Recent hemoptysis ( = &gt; ½ teaspoon red blood within 8 week first dose study drug ) . Any serious and/or unstable preexist medical , psychiatric , condition could interfere subject 's safety , provision inform consent , compliance study procedure . Unable unwilling discontinue use prohibit medication list protocol least 14 day five halflives drug ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study drug duration study . Treatment follow anticancer therapy : radiation therapy , chemotherapy , immunotherapy , biologic therapy , investigational therapy surgery tumor embolization within 14 day prior first dose pazopanib OR hormonal therapy within 14 day five halflives drug ( whichever longer ) prior first dose Pazopanib Administration nononcologic investigational drug within 30 day 5 half life whichever longer prior receive first Any ongoing toxicity prior hormonal therapy &gt; Grade 1 and/or progress severity .</criteria>
