	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) characterise airflow limitation fully reversible , usually progressive associate abnormal inflammatory response lungs noxious particle gas , commonly cigarette smoking . The disease affect large central airway also small , peripheral airway deeply lung , define less 2 mm diameter . Besides medical treatment , physiotherapy play major role treatment various method suggest remove airway secretion . The flutter simple small device shape like pipe creates positive expiratory pressure ( PEP ) high frequency oscillation expire air pass . These vibration think mobilise airway secretion facilitate clearance improve breathing . Standard blowing test , like spirometry , patient blow forcedly machine , previously use investigate efficacy flutter device . However , spirometry ass damage large airways small airway , also know `` silent zone '' , crucially , specifically damage COPD . In study investigator hypothesise flutter help clear airway excessive thick mucus produce COPD patient , patient may find easy breathe low resistance move air lung . The main objective study compare effect flutter sham device small airway damage use impulse oscillometry ( IOS ) , non-invasive method , contrary common blowing test , measure small airway resistance normal breathing . In addition , COPD characterise inflammation , investigator would also like measure gas patient blow , nitric oxide ( NO ) level reflect airway inflammation . This give investigator insight relationship airway inflammation small airway function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) characterise airflow limitation fully reversible . This limitation usually progressive associate abnormal inflammatory response lungs noxious particle gas . Patients suffer COPD may show pathologic change large also small airway , define less 2mm diameter . Airway inflammation may cause increase thick mucus secretion narrow airway increase resistance airflow . Physiotherapy remove secretion indicated patient COPD regular sputum thick secretion various technique physiotherapy device apply removal secretion . The flutter simple small device shape like pipe creates positive expiratory pressure ( PEP ) high frequency oscillation expire air pass . These vibration PEP think mobilise airway secretion facilitate clearance improve airflow . The effect flutter device study different patient group , especially lung disease characterise mucus hypersecretion COPD , cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis . In COPD , even though flutter device increase volume expectorate secretion , beneficial effect pulmonary function assess spirometry plethysmography inconclusive . However , standard lung function test ( spirometry ) asses large airway , provide accurate estimate small airway describe author `` silent zone '' . The investigator hypothesise use impulse oscillometry ( IOS ) , non-invasive technique provide information small airway resistance normal breathing , may reveal effect flutter device may accurately measure spirometry previous study . In addition , investigator would like measure exhale nitric oxide ( NO ) level reflect airway inflammation may therefore useful determine association small airway disease inflammation . In summary , symptoms patient COPD improve follow breathing exercise flutter device , however , effect device lung function unclear . The investigator hypothesise combine use IOS NO , would help understand quantify effect flutter device small airway disease COPD . The main objective study measure effect 30 minute breathe exercise flutter device airway resistance assess impulse oscillometry patient COPD . The secondary objective investigate association inflammation , airway resistance volume secretion COPD patient .</detailed_description>
