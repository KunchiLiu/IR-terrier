	<brief_summary>The aim care protocol study effect scan help epidural infiltration realization , presume difficult patient suffer sciatica . These scan already perform Rheumatology Department objective evaluate objectively contribution patient doctor . Epidural infiltration young patient , easy anatomical identification , cause generally technical difficulty , therefore protocol include patient presumed difficult infiltration , mean aged 60 , and/or BMI &gt; 30 and/or suffer scoliosis . This study concern patient hospitalize Rheumatology Department ( Hospital Nantes ) first epidural infiltration treatment-resistant lombosciatica . Patient randomize Day 0 , infiltration . This latter perform accordance current practice . Tolerance data ( pain satisfaction ) collect infiltration eventual complication report within 48 hour infiltration . Following treatment lombosciatic realize hospitalization , usual . Scan safe , non invasive , painless non radiate exam . It extension musculoskeletal clinical exam already change rheumatology practice . The investigator hope end study , result would confirm scan help practice perform epidural infiltration .</brief_summary>
