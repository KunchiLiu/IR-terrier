	<brief_summary>This Phase II study conduct assess safety efficacy CPI-613 patient advance and/or metastatic solid tumor available therapy provide clinical benefit refuse standard therapy . The primary outcome measure Overall Survival ( OS ) . The secondary outcome measure : Response Rate ( RR ) , Progression-Free Survival ( PFS ) , safety .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Safety , Tolerability Efficacy Study CPI-613 Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Open-Label Single-Arm Design : This open-label study , investigator subject blind treatment . Also , assignment patient randomize , since single-arm study . Treatment CPI-613 : A treatment cycle 4 week , CPI-613 give Days 1 4 first 3 week . Dose Sample Size : The dose CPI-613 3,000 mg/m2 . This Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) determine Phase I dose-escalated trial , Study # CL-CPI-613-009 ( conduct patient hematologic malignancy IND 107,800 ) . This dose also find well tolerate another Phase I dose-escalated trial , Study # CL-CPI-613-002 ( conduct patient solid tumor IND 74,530 ) . There 20 evaluable patient tumor type . Once 20 evaluable patient particular tumor type treat least 1 cycle , patient tumor type accrue . Dosing Delay Dose Modification CPI-613 Event Adverse Events : For adverse event unrelated serum creatinine elevation reduction renal function possibly related CPI-613 , occurrence Grade 1 toxicity generally require dose modification subsequent dose patient . However , Grade 2 toxicity ( alopecia nausea ) probably related CPI-613 develops , treatment withheld resume Grade 2 toxicity reduce Grade 1 , dose level subsequent dose patient reduce 25 % dose Grade 2 toxicity occurs . Grade 2 alopecia nausea require withholding treatment dose reduction . If Grade 3 4 toxicity probably related CPI-613 develops , dose CPI-613 patient withheld patient shall monitor recovery , reversibility , Grade 3 4 toxicity . To resume treatment CPI-613 patient CPI-613-related Grade 3 4 toxicity , Grade 3 4 toxicity must reduce Grade 1 , dose level subsequent dose patient reduce 50 % dose Grade 3 4 toxicity occurs . For adverse event related creatinine elevation reduction renal function possibly related CPI-613 , dose patient withheld even severity level Grade 1 . Treatment resume toxicity reduce Grade 0 . The dose level subsequent dose patient reduce 15 % severity level Grade 1 , 25 % Grade 2 toxicity , 50 % Grade 3 4 toxicity . Furthermore , toxicity possibly relate CPI-613 acute renal failure severity level Grade 3 4 , patient enrollment temporarily suspend order enable assessment follow aspect trial implementation corrective measure protocol amendment , necessary : - compliance study sit investigator study protocol - evaluation appropriateness procedure monitor renal function</detailed_description>
