	<brief_summary>Our research compare lung baby young child CF ( cystic fibrosis ) without CF . We look blood flow lung help doctor well understand CF damage lungs prevent damage future . We use MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) special blood test way understand early change lung baby young child CF . We look special blood test see work signal doctor well understand change happen lung . For baby CF , compare MRI image lung CT image ( also sometimes call CAT scan Computerized Tomography ) . We hope study help u reduce number X-rays CT scan child CF might get future . Because MRI 's use radiation , could reduce amount radiation exposure child CF would get lifetime .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using MRI Observe Lung Changes Infants With CF Compared Infants Without CF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cystic fibrosis ( CF ) well characterize multi-organ disease produce mucus obstruction , chronic lung infection , inflammation , oxidant stress . These process result airway damage , chronic pulmonary symptom , ultimately death young adulthood . These process largely silent infant toddler CF population , ultimately result lung damage symptom CF . Detection monitoring lung disease infants toddler CF currently limit , major barrier advancement care research population . This study perform CF non-CF control age 6 month - 4.5 year , repeat measure CF patient window . We intend examine new technique evaluate lung CF infant base magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) incorporate measurement lung structure blood flow . In CF group , augment MRI image CT image determine structural relationship MR CT ( gold standard ass lung structure CF ) . We correlate image data core peripheral biomarkers CF use unbiased , metabolomic proteomic-based approach . It hop result study provide support use MRI monitor lung structure blood flow early CF lung disease , potentially provide modality monitor disease status independent radiation exposure . We hypothesize MRI lung pulmonary circulation potential serve sensitive portable tool monitor early CF lung disease . We examine three functional aspect pulmonary blood flow ( total regional pulmonary perfusion , vascular resistance , aortopulmonary collateral blood flow ) compare structural assessment lung MRI CT . This proposal couple advancement magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) techniques emerge technology metabolomics proteomics , link new MR imaging candidate novel pathway analysis . We use new technology ( metabolomics proteomics - perform peripheral blood sample ) determine alter signal pathway detect blood relate change lung . We hypothesize change pulmonary perfusion and/or structure correlate peripheral biomarkers identify metabolomics proteomic methodology . Candidate metabolomic pathway show segregate CF non-CF condition ( include oxidative status , purinergic signaling , glucose metabolism ) focus initial biomarker analysis , advance bioinformatic technique apply define novel relationship metabolome image . Proteomics serve validate function , help assign enzyme pathway metabolomics alteration . The study design include 30 CF subject divide 2 age group ( 6 12 month old 24 36 month old ) receive chest CT High Resolution CT ( HRCT ) baseline 12 month later . They compare 30 age match non-CF subject one visit MRI contrast . The non-CF group include subject schedule MRI clinical reason additional chest image end schedule MRI . Both group blood draw measure metabolomic proteomic marker .</detailed_description>
