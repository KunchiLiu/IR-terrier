	<brief_summary>One every six men diagnose prostate cancer post prostatectomy 75 % report urinary incontinence . There many hypothesis exact cause post prostatectomy stress incontinence ( PPI ) . Existing study focus surgical cadaveric dissection define structure responsible PPI . Contemporary 3T MRI allows three dimensional , sub-millimeter resolution human pelvis clearly demonstrate pelvic anatomy without distortion dissection . It overarch hypothesis PPI multifactorial occurs combination specific anatomical functional impairment . We propose conduct case control study match age race compare MRI anatomy urinary tract function urodynamics 20 men PPI ( case ) 20 men continent post prostatectomy ( control ) minimum 12 month post surgery . We use static dynamic MRI 3 Tesla make objective measurement bladder neck , external urethral sphincter , pelvic floor , urethral anastomotic fibrosis , urethral hypermobility- believe play large part continence . Multi-channel urodynamic study also perform assess leak point maximum urethral closure pressure . All case control complete standardize questionnaire - AUA symptom index Incontinence Severity Index quality life measure . This study need provide critical information cause male PPI , quality life alter void dysfunction , assist advancement pharmacological surgical treatment disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>Only men include since study post prostatectomy incontinence . Cases comprise men post radical retropubic laparoscopic ( robotic ) prostatectomy stress urinary incontinence base history minimum 50 gram urine loss 24 hour pad weight . Controls comprise men post radical retropubic laparoscopic ( robotic ) prostatectomy kind amount incontinence base history . Cases control match age race show alter anatomical appearance structure low urinary tract function . Criteria group include urge incontinence , urinary retention , neurologic disease , insulin dependent diabetes , high dose steroid use , presurgical abnormal void function incontinence , prior pelvic radiation urologic surgery , prior incontinence surgery , current medical therapy incontinence perineal route radical prostatectomy since show give distinctly different appearance MRI compare laparoscopic retropubic approach . Any patient pelvic systemic recurrence prostate cancer also exclude . Any man relative absolute contraindication MRI implant claustrophobia exclude .</criteria>
