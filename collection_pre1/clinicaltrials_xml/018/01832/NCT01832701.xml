	<detailed_description>Coffee one widely consume beverage . It contain polyphenols ( chlorogenic acid ) bioavailability bioactive compound somewhat well understood . However , even chlorogenic acid know antioxidant cup , reliable evidence remain observed vivo . After medical examination approval , subject undergo 2 period 21 day . The first 7 day consist dietary restriction lower polyphenols intake . Then subject drink random one three treatment 14 day ( 4 cups/day ) . Blood urine sample collect throughout study evaluate vivo effect oxidative biomarkers . Furthermore , day 21 , subject undergo physical regimen increase acutely transiently oxidative damage . Blood urine sample collect throughout challenge allow u evaluate effect coffee intake reduce oxidative damage create exercise compare placebo .</detailed_description>
