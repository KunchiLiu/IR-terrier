	<brief_summary>This project design examine interaction microflora low airway concentration serum protein call alpha-1 antitrypsin . The hypothesis alpha-1 antitrypsin impact diversity content low airway microflora , result less inflammatory airway . The Specific Aims : 1 . To compare low respiratory tract microbiome virome population diversity content age GOLD stage match PiZZ individual receive augmentation therapy , PiZZ individual augmentation therapy , PiMZ individual receive augmentation therapy , PiMM individual chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . 2 . Determine correlation bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) peripheral blood gene expression pattern pattern lung microbial viral population across cohort . 3 . Correlate presence absence compute tomography ( CT ) bronchiectasis bronchiolectasis pattern microbiome population diversity content . 4 . To identify define novel molecular phenotype Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency ( AATD ) base computational integration clinical , transcriptomic , microbiome data .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency ( AATD , Alpha-1 ) genetic condition predisposes early onset pulmonary emphysema airway obstruction , often indistinguishable usual smoker 's chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . Prominent feature AATD COPD include basilar predominant panacinar emphysema , frequent radiographic bronchiectasis , prominent interaction environmental factor influence clinical disease phenotype . Alpha-1 antitrypsin ( AAT ) abundant serum lung antiprotease variety biologic activity influence lung homeostasis . Prominent among role neutrophil elastase inhibition , antiprotease activity cathepsins , involvement complement cascade , interaction toll receptor . Since effect AAT lung homeostasis remain poorly understood , Alpha-1 protocol Genomic Research AAT Deficiency Sarcoidosis ( GRADS ) grant ( hereafter call GRADS Alpha-1 protocol ) design investigate overarch hypothesis alpha-1 antitrypsin ( AAT ) impact diversity content low airway microflora , result less inflammatory airway . Since risk bronchiectasis , COPD severity measure GOLD stage , emphysema extent proportional serum AAT concentration , comparison different genotype AAT replete deficient population provide data determine diversity content low airway microflora influence risk COPD AATD population . The AATD population select individual measurable interaction environmental burdens22,28 may key garner understanding interplay important anti-protease , airways low lung inflammation , peripheral blood gene expression , radiologic clinical phenotype COPD . The GRADS Alpha-1 Study prospective cross-sectional cohort study enroll approximately 200 participant seven clinical center total nine recruitment location two year . An ancillary application SPIROMICS request data 50 PiMM subject , ( estimate 10 ) PiMZ subject , ( estimate 1 ) PiZZ subject . The remainder participant ( N=~139 ) recruit GRADS Alpha-1 center . All participant two study-related visit ( Baseline Bronchoscopy ) . During study visit , clinic staff conduct physical examination test , collect biological specimen , administer series questionnaire study participant . Participants could also receive telephone call determine final status adverse event , 1 month study conclusion .</detailed_description>
