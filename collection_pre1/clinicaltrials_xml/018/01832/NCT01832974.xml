	<brief_summary>IL-13-PE chemical similar one make body connected toxin specifically attack cancer cell . Researchers want look different dose IL-13-PE find one may safe effective cancer return , spread organ , surgically remove . Participants receive physical exam report side effect . Blood urine sample collect . Imaging study , tissue sample , test use study tumor start treatment study . IL-13-PE therapy give participant day 1 , 3 5 monthly cycle 4 monthly cycle . The study do two part , six-month period . If cancer continue grow , participant stop take IL-13-PE . If cancer continue shrink grow study continue , even follow-up period second part study . The first part study determine much IL-13-PE tolerate . For part , study recruit adult patient various type cancer . After six participant take low dose one experience dose-limiting toxicity , two participant may begin study take medium dose . If tolerate medium dose month , four may begin dose . When least three participant tolerate medium dose , two may attempt high dose . When tolerated high dose one monthly cycle , 1-4 may begin study , receive high dose . Adrenal cortex cancer ( ACC ) rare tumor gland kidney . It affect 1-2 people per million year cause hormone problem . This tumor affect child age 5 adult age 30-40 , cause death within five year 80 % . During second part study , participant ACC patient . They receive high dose tolerate Part 1 day 1 , 3 , 5 monthly cycle four month .</brief_summary>
