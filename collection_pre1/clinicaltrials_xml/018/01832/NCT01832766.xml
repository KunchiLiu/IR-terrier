	<detailed_description>The trial double two period ( visit ) blind cross-over trial one arm dronabinol 10 mg one arm placebo control . The order dose placebo randomize restriction half subject receive order . This counterbalance possible visit effect learn effect associate visit . The use oral cannabis analog equivalent smoking onset action slower . This people use dronabinol chronic pain prefer smoke cannabis . There `` high '' associate dronabinol . However , active ingredient , THC , similar effect cannabinoid 1 receptor . Ethically , feel could ask people smoke cannabis one day study . Subjects present GCRC 5:00 p.m . They abstain use cannabis overnight . The following morning , 8:00 a.m. , subject provide urine sample toxicology screen blood sample quantitative THC level .

Nicotine quickly remove body inhaled effect wear within 20 minute . Two hour administration , subject perform follow test : P50 auditory evoke potential- record consist presentation 5 set 16 click pair intrapair interval 500 ms heard headphones 3-minute rest set . Brain wave response record ; neurocognitive assessment-the California Verbal Learning Test measure verbal memory Stroop measure inhibition ; clinical symptom assessment- The BPRS administer measure positive negative symptom ; blood sample collect quantitative THC level . They escort Clinical Research Center nurse laboratory Colorado Psychiatric Hospital perform smooth pursuit eye movement In perform smooth pursuit eye movement , watch dot move across computer screen infrared sensor place front eye record eye movement . Each subject perform 3 trial one minute , 2 minute rest record . Subjects reassess BPRS drug exacerbation symptom , vitals , check adverse effect , perform sobriety test ( standard test use roadside test i.e . walk straight line finger nose test ) assess Dr. Olincy , experience assess sobriety , assure patient acutely intoxicate able perform normal function require coordination . If fail sobriety test , ask remain ( General Clinical Research Center ( GCRC ) pas sobriety test . Otherwise , discharge 5:00 p.m. Transportation GCRC provide cab service .
