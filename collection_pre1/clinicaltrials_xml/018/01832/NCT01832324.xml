	<brief_summary>The Study examines molecular basis food allergy . It explore interaction T cell , InKT cell cytokine development food allergy . The study also explore factor development tolerance `` outgrow '' food allergy . It also explore genetic factor lead development food allergy . The study examine type food allergy include IgE mediate reaction , Eosinophilic Esophagitis Food Protein Induced Enterocolitis</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Food Allergy ( FA ) common pediatric atopic disease . Characteristically child affect FA become sensitized food first month life spontaneously outgrow disease 5-6 year age 80 % case . At present time , diagnosis FA make combination history , skin test food challenge . The pathogenic mechanism lead food sensitization subsequent spontaneous tolerance development understood .</detailed_description>
