	<brief_summary>This study design evaluate use collection test measure eye response , balance , oculomotor reaction time test aid diagnosis mTBI . The test use highly precise measurement tool assess various neurologic function . ( For example , high-speed camera record eye movement , high-end motor precisely spin move subject , comprehensive analysis stitch together stimulus response . ) Hypotheses : 1 . A battery oculomotor , vestibular reaction time test generate variable properly weight run give multi-variant analysis , separate subject one two group , mTBI not-mTBI . 2 . A battery neurologic assessment test include reaction time , vestibular oculomotor test tax range neurologic function execute use one I-Portal® family device , generate response , use trained physician , aid diagnosis mTBI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study use prospective , between-subjects design compare Investigational ( mTBI ) Group Control Group . The Investigational Group include SM diagnose mTBI . The Control Group consist SM clinical symptom consistent mTBI . There 90 participant group , target total 180 study participant Existing mTBI evaluation tool use qualify type severity patient 's mTBI symptom . After volunteer assess physician , follow questionnaire screen tool administer : - Demographic , include control patient demographic , education , military service , see Appendix A ; - History health problem treatment include medication mTBI history stress level testing , include page 1 MACE , see Appendix B ; History health problem treatment include medication mTBI history stress level testing , include page 1 MACE , use second third test , see Appendix B1 ; - Glasgow Coma Scale , use 24 hrs accident , see Appendix C ; - Functional Gait Assessment ( FGA ) - This assessment individual ask perform ten gait task . Each gait task score trained observer 0-3 scale ( 0 could perform 3 perform well ) . The individual end total FGA 0-30 . The test sensitive demonstrate balance dysfunction improvement . ( see Appendix D ) - Trail Making Test ( TMT ) - This test cognitive test subject use pencil draw line order series letter letters/numbers paper . Subjects instruct follow appropriate order without lift pencil paper . Time completion sensitive measure cognitive performance . ( see Appendix E ) - Dizziness Handicap Inventory , ( DHI ) -This validate questionnaire commonly use clinician qualify quantify symptom associate dizziness , light-headedness , vertigo , migraine associate dizziness , assist identify complaint dizziness related anxiety , depression , post-traumatic-stress disorder , etc . This tool capture subjective symptom associate mTBI prior complete objective measure ( see Appendix F ) Device comprehensive oculomotor/ neuro-otologic testing system . System component : - Motorized Chair move 3 axis - Full field Optokinetic stimulus - Pursuit Tracker™ - laser target generator - Isolation enclosure - Patient monitoring communication technology FDA classification : The NOTC cover FDA 510K , certify standard 60601-1 , 60601-1-1 , 60601-1-2 , 60601-1-4 . Modifications approve device : Included manufacturer : 1 . A new function exist button reaction time test 2 . Audio stimulus audio reaction time test 3 . 2 stationary LED 's installed inside enclosure ceiling crHIT test Investigational software incorporate newly define oculomotor reaction time test design investigate mTBI instal device .</detailed_description>
