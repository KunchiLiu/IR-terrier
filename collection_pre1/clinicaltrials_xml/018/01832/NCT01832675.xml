	<brief_title>Clinical Trial With Bupivacaine Lozenges Local Anaesthesia Under Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The research group previously conduct clinical study patient underwent UGE Department Gastroenterology , Hvidovre University Hospital , Denmark , effect new lidocaine lozenge compare lidocaine suspension use standard treatment . The result show lozenge increase patient 's acceptance gag reflex , decrease patient discomfort UGE thereby increase patient acceptance UGE . Furthermore , significant improvement assessment taste texture lozenge compare suspension . A study Thanvi et al . show difficult obtain valid VAS score patient sedate , might cause amnesia may impair patient 's ability make accurate assessment discomfort . Sedation limitation study conduct research group , impairment patient judgmental ability . Furthermore long duration effect lozenge request . Therefore , research group reformulate lozenge change active pharmaceutical ingredient ( API ) bupivacaine . Bupivacaine amide lidocaine , longer anesthetic effect four time potent lidocaine . It would therefore relevant optimize study design perform new clinical study unsedated patient undergo UGE , bupivacaine lozenge test . The clinical study perform private gastrointestinal ( GI ) clinic Hvidovre , Denmark . Before UGE perform patient locally anesthetize pharynx lidocaine spray standard treatment . The hypothesis bupivacaine lozenge would reduce patient experienced discomfort UGE due well local anesthetic effect compare lidocaine spray . Moreover hypothesize bupivacaine lozenge would patient friendly lidocaine spray well taste mask accord less bitter taste pleasant mode anesthetize . The aim study compare patient discomfort two different local anesthetic method . The standard treatment lidocaine pharyngeal spray compare experimental treatment bupivacaine lozenge . The efficacy acceptance treatment also examine , well taste anesthetic . Furthermore patient 's endoscopist 's assessment UGE examine .</detailed_description>
