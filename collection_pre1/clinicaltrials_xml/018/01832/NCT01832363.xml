	<brief_title>Bronchial Thermoplasty Severe Asthmatics Guided HXe MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study explore feasibility use hyperpolarized xenon ( HXe ) Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) diagnostic imaging agent prioritize order airway treatment bronchial thermoplasty , rather FDA approve pre-established treatment sequence perform today . The Alair® Bronchial Thermoplasty System FDA approve device clinically proven effective treat severe asthma patient well control inhaled corticosteroid long act beta agonist . Bronchial thermoplasty ( BT ) procedure reduce excessive airway smooth muscle radio wave ablation , thus decrease ability airway constrict asthma attack . The BT procedure perform three separate outpatient treatment session , treat pre-established region lung . The session separate least three week heal time . MagniXene® pure xenon gas magnetically alter become contrast agent magnetic resonance imaging lung . The subject inhales hyperpolarized xenon inside MRI scanner highly detailed ventilation map lung space acquire short breath-hold . By detect unventilated region airway reactivity use HXe image , prioritized scheme perform bronchial thermoplasty elaborate treat problematic airway within first BT session . In study rest airway treat follow two session , airway treat end standard procedure . This study include approximately 30 patient clinically indicate undergo bronchial thermoplasty . Half patient randomly assign receive HXe guide BT , half receive standard BT procedure . HXe image clinical measure asthma disease severity , Asthma Quality Life Questionnaire ( AQLQ ) , Asthma Control Test ( ACT ) , morning expiratory peak flow ( AM-PEF ) , pulmonary function test ( PFT ) , acquire three time point interleave BT session : BT , 12 week first session BT , 12 week third session BT ( approximately 36 week baseline ) . HXe MRI repeat within day bronchodilator treatment patient establish airway reactivity . Additionally , three-week follow HXe MRI allow u study temporal variability HXe metric . A total six HXe image session ( distinctive day ) , include least four HXe image dedicate patient . The primary outcome study determine extent guide treatment inferior benefit standard full treatment course . The statistical metric incremental change AQLQ score .</detailed_description>

FEV1 ≥ 50 % predict prebronchodilator . Asthma symptoms least two day one night per week last 2 week . Subject nonsmoker 1 year great ( former smoker , less 10 packyears total smoke history ) . Patient clinical indication bronchial thermoplasty decide treat physician . Ability undergo bronchoscopy opinion investigator . Exclusion Criteria ( bronchial thermoplasty ) : Asthma exacerbation ( ED visit , hospitalization , course increase systemic steroid , urgent health care visit asthma ) prior four week . Asthma exacerbation require hospitalization prior six week . Chronic oral steroid therapy great 30 mg per day . Respiratory tract infection within past 4 week Subject know sensitivity medication require perform bronchoscopy ( lidocaine , atropine benzodiazepine ) . Subject undergoing immunosuppressant therapy ( e.g. , methotrexate ) . Subject anticoagulant medication . Subject bleed diathesis , platelet dysfunction , thrombocytopenia platelet count le 125,000/mm2 know coagulopathy ( INR &gt; 1.5 ) . Subject respiratory disease include interstitial lung disease , emphysema , cystic fibrosis , vocal cord dysfunction , mechanical upper airway obstruction , untreated obstructive sleep apnea , ChurgStrauss syndrome , cardiac dysfunction , allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis ( total IgE &gt; 1000 Units/mL positive specific IgE aspergillus evidence central bronchiectasis ) . Subject segmental atelectasis , lobar consolidation , significant unstable pulmonary infiltrate , pneumothorax , confirm xray .
