	<brief_summary>This randomized phase I/II trial study side effect best dose fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR ) inhibitor AZD4547 give docetaxel see well work treat patient recurrent non-small cell lung cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether docetaxel FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 effective give together separately .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determination recommend phase II dose combination docetaxel AZD4547 ( FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 ) . ( Phase I ) II . Estimation comparison progression-free survival ( PFS ) treatment arm . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I. Pharmacokinetic evaluation docetaxel without concomitant AZD4547 . Pharmacokinetic evaluation AZD4547 concomitant docetaxel . ( Phase I ) II . Safety assessment toxicity characterization combination . ( Phase I ) III . Initial assessment clinical activity combination . ( Phase I ) IV . Response rate . ( Phase II ) V. Overall survival . ( Phase II ) VI . Estimation response single agent AZD4547 among patient crossover single agent docetaxel . ( Phase II ) VII . Further safety assessment toxicity characterization AZD4547 alone combination docetaxel . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 follow randomized phase II study . PHASE I : Patients receive docetaxel intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 2-15 course 1 day 1-14 subsequent course . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PHASE II , STEP I : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive docetaxel IV 60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients experience progressive disease may receive FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 PO BID day 1-14 . ARM II : Patients receive docetaxel IV Arm I FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 PO BID day 1-14 . In arm , course repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . PHASE II , STEP II : Patients receive FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 PO BID day 1-14 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 year . This study open accrual September 19 , 2013 suspend accrual January 29 , 2014 first two patient register first dose level phase I experience dose limit toxicity ( DLTs ) week 1 cycle 1 . The study subsequently terminate April 17 , 2014 meet predefined criterion closure per phase I study design .</detailed_description>
