	<brief_summary>The Canadian Diabetes Association recommend optimize glycemic control achieve glycated hemoglobin ( A1C ) less 7 % patient diabetes . Despite recommendation , approximately 25 % patient undergoing cardiac surgery evidence suboptimal glycemic control ( A1C &gt; 7 % ) . Recent research demonstrate patient experience high rate post-operative complication significantly bad short-term long-term post-operative survival . Therefore , recommend attempt make improve glycemic control patient wait elective surgery . However , present process care facilitate pre-operative glycemic control optimization exist Canada . The objective project determine feasibility effectiveness comprehensive community-based pre-operative diabetes optimization program patient await elective cardiac surgery .</brief_summary>
