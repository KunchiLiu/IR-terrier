	<brief_summary>The goal investigation generate need PMCF data HiFocus Mid-Scala electrode . As point interest investigator would like evaluate benefit patient low-frequency residual hearing implanted HiFocus Mid-Scala Electrode . The HiFocus Mid-Scala electrode array design allow surgeon flexibility use variety contemporary surgical technique show enable easy insertion minimize cochlear trauma ( see , e.g. , Adunka Buchman , 2007 ; Friedland Runge-Samuelson , 2009 ; Roland et al. , 2007 ) . Temporal bone experiment show HiFocus Mid-Scala electrode array straightforward insert cause minimal trauma cochlear structure surgery ( Lenarz et al. , 2010 ) . In addition , HiFocus Mid-Scala already show safe electrode promise post op clinical result premarketing study final stage .</brief_summary>
