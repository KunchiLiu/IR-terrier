	<brief_title>A Pharmacokinetic Safety Study Osmotic Release Oral System ( OROS ) Hydromorphone Non-Opioid Tolerant Chinese Participants With Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , single-dose study adult chinese participant cancer . The study consist screen phase ( within 21 1 day admission research facility Day -1 ) follow 4-day open-label treatment phase ( Day -1 Day 3 ) . Participants remain confined study center Day -1 completion end-of-study visit withdrawal assessment , do upon completion 48-hour pharmacokinetic sample Day 3 , upon early withdrawal . The total study duration approximately 24 day . All participant undergo naloxone challenge test ( subcutaneous [ skin ] dose 0.8 milligram [ mg ] ) opioid dependency screen phase . Only participant pass challenge test allow continue study . During treatment phase , upon completion 10-hour overnight fast , participant receive single oral ( mouth ) 8 mg dose hydromorphone morning Day 1 . Serial blood sample collect immediately 48 hour dose determination plasma hydromorphone concentration . Participants administer naltrexone 50 mg , block opioid effect hydromorphone , 14 hour , 2 hour , 10 hour study drug administration . After 10-hour dose , additional dos naltrexone administer every 12 hour 34 hour postdose . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
