	<brief_title>Transmission Reduction Prevention With HPV Vaccination ( TRAP-HPV ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two prophylactic vaccine ( Gardasil Merck , Cervarix GlaxoSmithKline ) proven randomize control trial ( RCT ) highly effective prevent infection target HPV type ( HPV-6 , 11 , 16 and18 , Gardasil , HPV-16/18 , Cervarix ) cervical precancerous lesion cause . These vaccine shift paradigm prevention expect major impact reduce burden cervical cancer HPV-associated malignancy , vulvar , vaginal , penile , anal , oropharyngeal cancer , well benign HPV-associated condition ( case Gardasil ) , anogenital wart respiratory papillomatosis . However , little known extent vaccination may reduce transmission sexual partner ; i.e . much remain understood effect HPV vaccine prevent transmission target HPV type sexual partner vaccinated individual impact herd immunity . The investigator propose conduct placebo-controlled , double-blinded RCT measure impact vaccination prevent HPV transmission within young ( age 18-45 ) heterosexual couple McGill Concordia Universities Montreal , Canada . Individual partner 500 couple randomize treatment ( Gardasil 9 ) control vaccine ( Havrix , hepatitis A vaccine ) . This control vaccine provide similar health benefit incentive HPV vaccination preserve scientific cogency `` placebo '' comparator . Risk factor data collect via computerized questionnaire enrolment ( time 0 ) , 2 , 4 , 6 , 9 12 month . At time point , investigator measure HPV DNA infection status PCR partner exfoliate penile , oral sample men vaginal , oral sample woman . Assessing pre-enrolment humoral immune response HPV infection competitive Luminex immunoassay ( CLIA ) do enrolment blood sample study participant . The primary outcome reduction HPV DNA positivity target HPV vaccine type ( type 6 , 11 , 16 18 ) multiple anatomic sit Havrix-treated sexual partner participant receive Gardasil 9 . The investigator hypothesize HPV vaccination effective reducing risk HPV transmission sexual partner . They use Kaplan-Meier technique logrank test compare cumulative probability HPV infection sexual partner vaccinate versus unvaccinated individual follow-up time , Cox proportional hazard regression estimate effect vaccination covariates transmission HPV sexual partner . Statistical analysis follow intention-to-treat approach additional regression model examine role several candidate determinant mediate transmission protective effect . Mixed-effects model also use take advantage repeat measurement across visit , HPV type , anatomical site subject . In addition finding protection unvaccinated partner , expect study provide valuable insight whether protection may exist vaccine recipient prevent infection anatomical site target type yet establish infection . These finding generate key parameter data inform extent herd immunity cost-effectiveness model HPV vaccination . Such model essential arrive rational science-driven policy HPV vaccination girl boy Canada . ( full protocol available upon request )</detailed_description>
