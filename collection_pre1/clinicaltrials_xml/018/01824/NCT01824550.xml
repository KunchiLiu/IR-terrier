	<detailed_description>This study use two-arm randomized control trial ( RCT ) design examine effect home-based exercise training program versus minimal exercise , attention control condition marker subclinical atherosclerosis mobility disability person MS . The primary outcome subclinical atherosclerosis include measure arterial structure function measure mobility disability include six-minute walk time 25-foot walk , GaitRite walk assessment one week accelerometry data . Fifty-four person MS Expanded Disability Status Score ( EDSS ) score 0 4.0 randomize either home-based exercise training condition attention control condition . Participation study include 3-month exercise program complete home . In addition , participant need come University Illinois Chicago ( UIC ) three time undergo test . Each visit take 3-4 hour complete . Testing take place three visit include blood pressure measurement , six vascular ( artery ) measurement , heart measurement , short walking test , peak aerobic capacity test , blood draw , five quality Life questionnaires two cognitive function test . The home-based exercise regimen include cycle ergometry aerobic mode training 3 time per week gradual progression duration intensity across 12-week period . Exercise prescription base peak aerobic capacity cycle test conduct first visit . The attention control involve stretch use frequency duration across 12-week period exercise recommend National Multiple Sclerosis Society ( NMSS ) . Both arm receive weekly internet `` coaching '' session via video chat . Subclinical atherosclerosis mobility disability data collect , 6 week train immediately 12-week intervention .</detailed_description>
