	<brief_summary>Patients early advance stage epithelial ovarian cancer treat postoperative systemic chemotherapy appropriate surgical stag cytoreductive surgery . For ovarian cancer patient recurrence , salvage chemotherapy without secondary cytoreductive surgery recommend . The recommendation specific primary adjuvant salvage chemotherapy cyclophosphamide paclitaxel plus platinum regimen . Despite high objective response rate associate primary chemotherapy ovarian cancer , majority patient eventually experience disease recurrence potential candidate second-line treatment approach . Ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma ( OCCA ) recognize distinct histological type cancer WHO-classification ovarian tumor . OCCA think arise endometriosis patient present disease early stage ( International Federation Gynecology Obstetrics ( FIGO ) stag I II ) . The incidence OCCA among epithelial ovarian cancer estimate less 5-10 % . However , OCCA occur frequent Japan Taiwan ( around 10-15 % ) . Unfortunately , OCCA usually resistant systemic chemotherapy type poor prognosis . Sunitinib small molecule anti-tumor property pharmacologically mediate inhibition multiple receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTKs ) , important regulator tumor cell growth , angiogenesis , metastasis . Due multi-targeted profile , pharmacological activity sunitinib likely mediate inhibition multiple RTK target multiple pathway . c-KIT implicate mastocytosis/mast cell leukemia , germ cell cancer , small-cell lung cancer , GISTs , AML , neuroblastoma , melanoma , ovarian breast carcinoma . In addition , sunitinib demonstrate high response rate report anti- VEGF antibody treatment patient renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) . A clinical case report indicate sunitinib effective treat recurrent ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma ( OCCA ) almost resistant second line chemotherapy . So would like conduct Phase II Sunitinib clinical trial recurrent / persistent ovarian clear cell cancer patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ovarian cancer 10th lead cancer woman Taiwan . There 894 new case 2004 297 woman die ovarian cancer 2001 accord data release Department Health . The incidence epithelial ovarian cancer increase age median age time diagnosis 63 year , 70 % patient present advanced disease . Primary treatment ovarian cancer consist appropriate surgical stag cytoreductive surgery , follow patient systemic chemotherapy . Initial surgery comprehensive stag laparotomy . For patient clinical stage III IV disease , usual recommendation continue maximally cytoreductive surgery follow adjuvant chemotherapy . Most patient epithelial ovarian cancer receive postoperative systemic chemotherapy . Observation recommend stage Ia , grade 1 tumor , owe high cure rate . For patient higher-grade and/or higher-stage tumor , systemic chemotherapy indicate . The recommendation specific primary chemotherapy/primary adjuvant therapy Paclitaxel plus platinum regimen . Paclitaxel plus cisplatin carboplatin recommend regimen . The extent treatment vary stage disease . For patient advanced-stage disease , six cycle chemotherapy recommend , whereas earlier-stage disease , three six cycle recommend , pending result ongoing study group patient . Treatment relapse ovarian cancer Despite high objective response rate associate primary platinum/taxane-based chemotherapy advance ovarian cancer , majority patient eventually experience disease recurrence potential candidate second-line treatment approach . Treatment option relapse cancer numerous . Patients platinum-sensitive tumor ( response initial platinum therapy relapse least 6 month ) may retreat platinum agent and/or taxanes upon relapse . Clear cell carcinoma ovary comprise approximately 5 % ovarian neoplasms exhibit unique feature include aggressive clinical course malignant behavior . Clinically , clear cell carcinoma often present large pelvic mass , majority detect early stage ( FIGO stage I ) . Despite early stage diagnosis , survival rate significantly low woman clear cell carcinoma relative stage-matched serous adenocarcinoma ovary . Furthermore , tumor chemoresistant , result high degree recurrence exhibit frequent early metastasis lymph node parenchymal organ . Sunitinib small molecule anti-tumor property pharmacologically mediate inhibition multiple receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTKs ) , important regulator tumor cell growth , angiogenesis , metastasis . Specifically , sunitinib potent ATP-competitive inhibitor catalytic activity group closely related RTKs consist VEGFR-1 , -2 , -3 , PDGFR-α -β , KIT , CSF-1R , FLT-3 , RET . Due multi-targeted profile , pharmacological activity sunitinib likely mediate inhibition multiple RTK target multiple pathway . In study , would like evaluated effect Sunitinib recurrent / persist ovarian clear cell carcinoma .</detailed_description>
