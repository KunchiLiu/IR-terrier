	<brief_summary>Globally , stunt affect 26 % ( 165 million ) under-5-year child , underlies 15-17 % mortality lead long-term cognitive deficit , few year poor performance school , low adult economic productivity , high risk child also stunt , perpetuate problem future generation . Stunting begin antenatally peaks 18-24 month postnatal life , mean length-for-age Z-score ( LAZ ) -2.0 among child live Africa Asia . Improving diet young child reduce stunting , though , best , one-third . Frequent diarrheal illness also implicate . However , effect diarrhea permanent stunt relatively small , maybe child grow `` catch-up '' rate illness episode . The Sanitation Hygiene Infant Nutrition Efficacy ( SHINE ) trial motivate 2-part premise : - A major cause child stunt anemia Environmental Enteric Dysfunction ( EED ) . EED subclinical disorder small intestine , virtually ubiquitous among asymptomatic people live low-income setting throughout world . EED characterize increase permeability facilitate microbial translocation systemic circulation trigger chronic immune activation . - The primary cause EED infant ingestion fecal microbe due live condition poor quality quantity water , sanitation , hygiene ( WASH ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Sanitation Hygiene Infant Nutrition Efficacy ( `` SHINE '' ) trial test effect two package intervention : 1 ) improve water , sanitation hygiene ( WASH ) 2 ) improve infant young child feeding ( IYCF ) child stunt anemia first 18 month life . The trial conduct rural Zimbabwe WASH poor , food insecurity high , 15 % pregnant woman infect HIV . The study enroll 5282 woman early pregnancy follow infant 18 month delivery . The study cluster-randomized control trial : two entire district central Zimbabwe divide 212 geographic area , 100 household . The area randomly allocate ( , assign accord chance like flip coin ) one four intervention : 1 . Improved WASH ( ventilate pit latrine , hand wash facility soap , drink water treatment , protect play space health lesson adopt improve hygiene behavior ) 2 . Improved Infant Nutrition ( health lesson best infant feeding practice nutritional supplement ( Nutributter ) feed daily baby 6 18 month ) . 3 . Improved WASH Infant Nutrition ( intervention ) 4 . Standard Care All woman live two district become pregnant recruitment period study invite enroll . They receive one 4 package intervention accord area live . Health lesson give Village Health Workers . Latrines hand wash facility construct building team . Mothers follow research nurse 7 month gestation , 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 month delivery . Primary outcome infant height hemoglobin 18 month age . Within SHINE measure two causal pathway : biomedical pathway program impact pathway . The biomedical pathway comprise infant biologic response WASH IYCF intervention ultimately result attained stature hemoglobin concentration 18 month age ; elucidate measure biomarkers intestinal structure function ( inflammation , regeneration , absorption permeability ) ; microbial translocation ; systemic inflammation ; hormonal determinant growth anemia among subgroup infant enrol EED substudy . The investigator also ask mother record daily episodes diarrhea ; blood/mucus stool ; cough ; fast difficult breathing ; fever ; lethargy prevent breastfeeding , child 1 month 18 month age . A subgroup infant also stool sample collect diarrhoeal episode evaluate reduction pathogen-specific diarrhoea follow WASH intervention . Since mother enrol SHINE live unsanitary living condition throughout life , anticipate degree EED . It hypothesize result chronic inflammation contributes adverse birth outcome , prematurity low birth weight . This question investigate observational design . For mother enrolled SHINE , sugar absorption test describe conduct specimen saliva , stool blood collect archive 10-12 week gestation visit subsequent assessment EED biomarkers . The association severity EED risk adverse birth outcome ( low birth length weight ; miscarriage , stillbirth , premature delivery ) assess . The program impact pathway comprise series process behavior link implementation intervention two child health outcome ; model use measure fidelity intervention delivery household uptake promote behavior practice . We also measure range household individual characteristic , social interaction , maternal capability childcare , hypothesize explain heterogeneity along pathway .</detailed_description>
