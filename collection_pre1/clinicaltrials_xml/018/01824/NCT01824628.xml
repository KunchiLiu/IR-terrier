	<detailed_description>Primary objective : The primary objective compare QT/QTc interval HIV positive subject treat antiretroviral therapy follow ambulatory HIV clinic QT/QTc interval : 1. outpatient HIV negative population health center pre-admission one-day surgical clinic . 2. large HIV-free korean population study ECG-ViEW database . Secondary objective : - Evaluate prevalence QTc interval prolongation outpatient HIV positive population comparatively two HIV negative outpatient population available one-day surgical clinic ECG-ViEW database . - Evaluate risk factor associate QTc interval prolongation outpatient HIV positive population compare outpatient HIV negative population population study ECG-ViEW database . - Compare QT/QTc interval prevalence QTc interval prolongation outpatient HIV positive population currently antiretroviral regimen include protease inhibitor versus antiretroviral regimen without protease inhibitor . - Compare QT/QTc interval among outpatient HIV positive population treat protease inhibitor , regard presence absence certain genetic polymorphism may influence pharmacokinetic aspect protease inhibitor .</detailed_description>
