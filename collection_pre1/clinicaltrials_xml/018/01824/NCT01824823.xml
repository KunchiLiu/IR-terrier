	<brief_title>Afatinib After Chemoradiation Surgery Treating Patients With Stage III-IV Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck High-Risk Recurrence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Examine disease-free survival ( DFS ) give afatinib/placebo adjuvant therapy patient viable tumor lymph node neck dissection suspect residual disease concurrent chemoradiation . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate recurrence rate , recurrence pattern , development second primary malignancy , overall survival ( OS ) toxicity afatinib/placebo . II . Evaluate on-target inhibition afatinib , determine circulate deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) biomarker afatinib resistance . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive afatinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . ARM B : Patients receive placebo PO QD day 1-28 . In Arms , treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 1 year every 12 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
