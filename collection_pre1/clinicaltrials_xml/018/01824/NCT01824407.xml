	<brief_summary>The Sponsor study , SANUWAVE , Inc. , develop investigational device know dermaPACE® ( Pulsed Acoustic Cellular Expression ) device possible treatment diabetic foot ulcer . This device generate acoustic ( sound ) pressure wave design act cell body generate protein may lead wound closure . The dermaPACE® device approve treatment diabetic foot ulcer ; therefore use study investigational . The purpose study evaluate ability dermaPACE® device help diabetic foot ulcer heal quickly . The active study device , dermaPACE® , compare inactive look-alike device ( call `` Sham '' ) study . The sham device provide treatment diabetic foot ulcer .</brief_summary>
