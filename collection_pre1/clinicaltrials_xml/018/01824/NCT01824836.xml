	<brief_summary>E1Z11 study determine whether certain genetic information predict breast cancer patient discontinue treatment AIs due development musculoskeletal symptom ( MSS ) . Women stage 1-111 breast cancer prescribe aromatase inhibitor anastrozole treatment may join .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Genetic Predictors Aromatase Inhibitor Musculoskeletal Symptoms ( AIMSS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To validate previously identify association 10 specific single nucleotide polymorphism ( single nucleotide polymorphisms [ SNPs ] ) discontinuation treatment aromatase inhibitor ( AIs ) due development musculoskeletal symptom ( MSS ) among woman breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether SNPs cytochrome P450 enzyme ( CYP ) , glucuronosyltransferases ( UGT ) , Vitamin D , serotonin receptor associated discontinuation treatment due development severe aromatase inhibitor-associated musculoskeletal symptom ( AIMSS ) . II . To determine whether SNPs CYP , UGT , Vitamin D , serotonin receptor associate development potential complication AI therapy . III . To develop gene signature identify patient risk develop severe anastrozole-related AIMSS potential complication AI therapy . IV . To determine epidemiology predictor severe AIMSS AI discontinuation . V. To describe patient report outcomes minority patient breast cancer treat AIs . VI . To assess utility Patient Reported Outcomes Management Information System ( PROMIS ) system collect patient report outcomes cooperative group study , validate PROMIS Physical Function 20a form patient AIMSS . VII . To develop model incorporate patient rating treatment burden , fear recurrence adherence behavior describe patient decision continue discontinue anastrozole . VIII . To collect serum sample future test biomarkers AIMSS . OUTLINE : Patients receive anastrozole orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) 12 month . After completion study treatment , patient follow 12 month .</detailed_description>
