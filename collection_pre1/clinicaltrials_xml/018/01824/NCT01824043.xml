	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To investigate effectiveness intravitreal application 0.5 mg Lucentis ( ranibizumab ) patient vitreous hemorrhage due proliferative diabetic retinopathy . The primary endpoint study mean change best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) baseline mean level Month 3 . Secondary Objectives : 1 . To assess difference mean change BCVA time ; 2 . To assess difference vitreous transparency ( amount hemorrhage ) fundus angiography exam ; 3 . To assess difference retinopathy severity level accord Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ; 4 . To correlate visual outcome serum glucose level .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Written informed consent must obtain study assessment perform . This study one group patient , total twenty subject stratify base decreased visual acuity due vitreous hemorrhage proliferative diabetic retinopathy : Stratus 1 ( ten subject ) : patient low moderate diabetic vitreous hemorrhage ; Stratus 2 ( ten subject ) : patient severe diabetic vitreous hemorrhage . Patients treat monthly : intravitreal ranibizumab ( 0.5 mg ) administer open-label fashion , use 3 monthly injection ( day 0 , day 30 day 60 ) follow additional post treatment visit , month last injection , posterior report . During regular , monthly visit , detailed ophthalmologic evaluation perform , include BCVA assessment . Vitreous hemorrhage density also assess , accord fundus visualization retinal angiography : 1. low moderate vitreous hemorrhage : posterior pole detail slightly hazy hazy ; 2. severe vitreous hemorrhage : fundus detail visible . All patient severe vitreous hemorrhage A/B ultrasound scan perform day injection . The intravitreal injection always last procedure perform give day . Blood sample also collect study visit , order ass serum glucose level . Laser treatment may administer investigator 's discretion vitreous hemorrhage reduce disappear intravitreal treatment ranibizumab retinal fundus visibility level permit photocoagulation . All patient study monitored adverse event remain usual clinical ophthalmological care end study .
