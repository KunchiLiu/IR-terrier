	<brief_summary>This pilot study conduct provide proof concept three recently develop needle treatment , treatment whiplash associate disorder type 2 ( WAD-II ) . The investigator aim show technique consider regular , effective option people suffer WAD-II . These technique Intramuscular stimulation ( IMS ) , neural prolotherapy ( NPT ) , myoActivation ( mA ) . Additionally , investigator plan begin profile responder non-responders effort identify treatment likely work best different people . In future , may help expedite treatment WAD-II , help patient get appropriate treatment , quickly . The investigator expect show three treatment significantly well placebo treatment , collect information make technique less likely work individual case .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Evidence show people recover whiplash symptom within acute phase ( 3 month post-injury ) may continue neck pain disability year later . The investigator hope show novel treatment offer long-lasting improvement chronic whiplash symptom long acute phase pass traditional treatment ( standard physiotherapy , massage , etc ) fail . Each needle technique small body research , anecdotal evidence , and/or patient feedback support use . All currently use clinical practice throughout British Columbia treatment many type chronic pain symptom . However , quite new , many clinician insurance company resistant recommend clients/patients , may suggest treatment last resort . Studies like one need provide concrete evidence efficacy treatment increase use . The objective project show proof concept - three needle technique valid placebo effect . The investigator plan use result study support effort secure fund large-scale , adequately powered study . Our long-term objective make type treatment readily available need traditional therapy currently offer . Secondary objective show relationship pain secondary measure ( function , depression , anxiety ) . The investigator plan begin profile patient less likely respond type needle treatment . This profile help identify people likely benefit treatment get patient best treatment , sooner . This double-blind , randomize control trial . The person evaluate change participant know treatment participant receive . Additionally , patient know treatment placebo group ( though may able use process elimination determine treatment NOT get , acceptable unavoidable ) . Once volunteer confirm eligible , randomly assign one four group - three treatment group control group . The investigator assess pain level ( several secondary outcome measure ) three timepoints : pre-treatment , post-treatment , 6-months post-treatment . At timepoint , primary secondary outcome measure evaluate , number general question ask . investigator hope show three technique , though somewhat novel yet well-supported literature , effective treat WAD-II . Additionally , investigator hope show effect long-lasting provide pilot data treatment reduce need access type treatment reduce need medication .</detailed_description>
