	<brief_title>Flexibly adding-on Second Antimuscarinic Agent First Antimuscarinics Refractory Overactive Bladder Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>- Introduction : Overactive bladder ( OAB ) symptom syndrome characterized urgency frequency without urgency incontinence . Usually metabolic anatomical disorder find patient OAB , condition may great impact quality life . Antimuscarinics first line treatment yield success rate 70 % . Urothelial dysfunction abnormality sensory receptor expression transmitter release suburothelial nerve might contribute OAB refractory antimuscarinics . In patient fail current antimuscarinic treatment , intravesical botulinum toxin A ( BoNT-A ) injection provide chance improvement . Previous study report success rate BoNT-A injection OAB range 60 80 % . Intravesical treatment inhibit abnormal receptor expression transmitter release sensory nerve terminal suburothelial space provide good therapeutic effect treatment OAB . However , patient might develop large postvoid residual ( PVR ) subsequent urinary tract infection ( UTI ) BoNT-A injection , therefore , treatment usually leave patient refractory antimuscarinic therapy . However , define antimuscarinic refractory OAB remain controversial . How many different type antimuscarinics prescribe call case failure elucidate . The aim study evaluate effect flexibly adding-on oxybutynin ER ( 5mg QD ) patient OAB refractory monotherapy first antimuscarinic agent ( tolterodine 4mg QD ) . - Methods : A total 200 patient refractory OAB include prospective , open label protocol . Inclusion criterion persistent OAB symptom ( frequency urgency with/without urgency urinary incontinence ) behaviour therapy optimize dose one antimuscarinic agent ( Tolterodine 4mg ) least 3 month . Patients neurogenic disease , untreated bladder outlet obstruction , recurrent UTI , large PVR ( &gt; 150ml ) exclude study . Patients randomized allocate treatment group ( receive tolterodine 4mg QD oxybutynin 5mg 15mg QD ) control group ( tolterodine 4mg QD ) 1:1 ratio base permuted block randomization code . Oxybutynin ER 5mg 15 mg daily flexibly adding-on baseline third month treatment group , depend patient 's effectiveness tolerability adverse event . At baseline , 1 3 month oxybutynin ER adding-on , assess International Prostate Symptom Score ( IPSS ) , Overactive Bladder Symptom Score ( OABSS ) , Patient Perception Bladder Condition ( PPBC ) , Urgency Severity Scale ( USS ) questionnaires , uroflowmetry PVR . The therapeutic effect consider successful reduction PPBC 2 baseline reduction USS 1 baseline , USS value 0 3 month . The adverse event tolerability combine therapy also assess . - Expected Results : Compared baseline , total IPSS , IPSS storage subscore , quality life index , OABSS , USS PPBC expect significantly decrease 1 3 month . PVR might increase 3 month adding-on treatment . The change IPSS void subscore , peak urinary flow rate void volume might increase comparable control group follow-up . We expect least one-third patient successful therapeutic effect without significantly increase adverse event . However , patient might withdraw study due adverse event severe dry mouth , constipation , large PVR , UTI , severe difficult urination acute urinary retention . Adverse event cautiously monitor treatment course .</detailed_description>
