We use schedule escalate monetary contingency base breath saliva and/or urine sample encourage abstinence . We obtain dependent measure twice/week . The primary measure reward responsivity percent choose hard task amount respond monetary reward EEfRT task score Rewarding Events scale . Other outcomes delay discount result self-reports anhedonia apathy . The study run 1 week pre-cessation ( 2 visit ) 4 week post-cessation . Measures biochemical verification occur twice/wk . Former smoker attend wee four week . For first week abstinence , cutoff nonsmoking CO &lt; 8 ppm . For remain week , abstinence verify score 0 ( &lt; 10 ng/ml cotinine ) test strip saliva urine sample plus CO &lt; 8 ppm . At initial session , completion baseline survey describe sample also measure plausible moderator depression . We believe direct test reward sensitivity evaluation influence abstinence operant respond reward . Thus , chosen performance Effort Expenditure Rewards Task ( EEfRT ) , examine respond function response cost , reward magnitude probability reward , one primary outcome . For self-report measure use Rewarding Events ( RE ) scale ask occurrence presume rewarding event anticipated pleasantness . Our RE scale ask participant rate 58 item frequency last week well perceived/expected pleasantness event .
