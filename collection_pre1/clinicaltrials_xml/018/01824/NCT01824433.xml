	<brief_summary>Women prone depression certain point life cycle , although etiologic therapeutic implication remain largely unknown1,2 . It report pre- postmenopausal woman significant difference response antidepressant , within large clinical trial data set3 , 4 . A grow number research indicate woman 's hormonal status may influence response different form antidepressant medication . Specifically , young woman appear respond well monoamine oxidase inhibitor ( MAOIs ) selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) , whereas men old woman tend relatively good response tricyclic antidepressant ( TCAs ) 1-5 . One difference class antidepressant SSRIs strongly serotoninergic , whereas TCAs predominantly noradrenergic effect . One pool analysis 6 suggests old woman ( age ≥ 50 ) tend respond poorer SSRI , phenomenen observe venlafaxine . The antidepressive mechanism venlafaxine noradrenergic serotonergic effect superior SSRIs . As noradrenergic serotonergic antidepressant , venlafaxinee demonstrate significant advantage response remission rate compare various SSRIs . As mention , old woman tend relatively good response TCAs predominantly noradrenergic antidepressant . Postmenopausal woman depression also would predict respond good SSRI administer along hormone replacement therapy 6 . This could critical understanding age difference antidepressant response across life cycle circulate estrogen level may modulate central serotoninergic pathway . Therefore , presume antidepressant enhance serotonergic noradrenergic neurotransmission , venlafaxine , may effective SSRIs postmenopausal woman major depressive disorder .</brief_summary>
