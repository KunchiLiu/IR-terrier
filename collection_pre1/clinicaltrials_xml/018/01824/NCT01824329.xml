	<brief_summary>Bladder cancer 4th common cancer amongst men . If bladder cancer invades muscle bladder fail local treatment , surgical removal bladder ( cystectomy ) creation new bladder intestine require . However , standard cystectomy affect urinary function sexual function . The investigator evaluate two modification cystectomy determine extent preserve urinary sexual function .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prostate Capsule Sparing Cystectomy Nerve-sparing Radical Cystoprostatectomy Men With Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radical cystoprostatectomy ( RCP ) standard treatment muscle invasive , refractory high grade , superficial bladder cancer . RCP involve removal bladder prostate . While effective treatment patient organ confine disease almost men follow RCP impotent due resection neurovascular bundle control erectile dysfunction . While neobladders ( new bladder form detubularized bowel connect native urethra ) allow patient void normally , many patient difficulty urinary incontinence . Two modification develop improve functional outcome surgery . Nerve spar cystectomy ( NSC ) attempt spare cavernosal nerve travel immediately adjacent lateral prostate routinely divide standard RCP . Published series NSC show improved preservation sexual function less urinary incontinence without compromise cancer control . Another alternative , prostate capsule spar cystectomy ( PCSC ) , remove adenoma prostatic urethra along urinary bladder , leave situ prostatic capsule subsequently surround neurovascular bundle . Several retrospective series demonstrate preservation sexual function improve urinary continence compare standard RCP neobladder . A concern PCSC prostate urothelial cancer invade prostate could leave behind preservation prostate capsule . Most reported series patient screen digital rectal exam , prostate prostatic urethral biopsy , PSA blood testing could identify patient risk prostate urothelial cancer prostate capsule preoperatively recommend alternative approach . Therefore , NSC PCSC appear offer good urinary sexual function properly select patient conventional RCP retrospective series . However , procedure evaluate prospectively randomized fashion . Our intent evaluate functional outcome PCSC NSC orthotopic neobladder term urinary sexual function use bladder cancer index , validate quality life instrument , determine surgical margin status , complication two surgical technique .</detailed_description>
