	<brief_summary>When limb traumatically sever , pain perceive part body long exist often develop . This call `` phantom limb '' pain , different `` stump '' pain , pain within part limb remain intact . Unfortunately , phantom pain resolve 16 % people , rest experience pain remainder live . There currently reliable treatment phantom limb pain . The exact reason phantom limb pain occurs unclear , nerve cut—as happen traumatic amputation—changes occur brain spinal cord actually worsen increase phantom pain . These abnormal change may often correct put local anesthetic—termed `` peripheral nerve block '' —on injure nerve , keep `` bad signal '' reach brain , resolution phantom limb pain . However , nerve block end hour , phantom pain return . But , demonstrate brain abnormalities—and phantom pain—that occur amputation may dependent upon `` bad '' signal send injured nerve ( ) , suggest long peripheral nerve block—lasting many day rather hours—may permanently reverse abnormal change brain , provide last relief phantom pain . Until recently , extend peripheral nerve block beyond 16 hour unrealistic . However , treatment option call `` continuous peripheral nerve block '' available . This technique involve placement tiny tube—smaller piece spaghetti—through skin next nerve supply amputate limb . The tiny tube may place minimal discomfort 15 minute . Numbing medicine call local anesthetic infuse tube , block signal injure nerve send spinal cord brain . Using small , portable infusion pump , prolong nerve block may provide individual ' home . The ultimate objective propose research study determine 6-day continuous peripheral nerve block provide home effective treatment persistent phantom limb pain follow traumatic limb amputation . The primary hypothesis ( researcher predict ) phantom limb pain intensity significantly decrease 4 week follow treatment 6-day continuous peripheral nerve block .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treating Phantom Limb Pain Using Continuous Peripheral Nerve Blocks : A Department Defense Funded Multicenter Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background . The combination increase munition force , use improvise explosive device , casualty survival rate result dramatic increase percentage injure combat veteran live traumatic amputation . Of American Veteran amputee , 35-98 % develop chronic , intractable pain perceive miss limb , phenomenon term `` phantom limb pain . '' This pain resolve 16 % afflicted individual , currently reliable treatment . The etiology phantom pain remain unclear , evidence suggest sever nerve provokes change spinal cord , thalamus , cerebral cortex . When neural input amputate limb block local anesthetic ( peripheral nerve block ) , cortical abnormality phantom pain frequently resolve . However , single-injection nerve block resolve hour , phantom pain return . These finding demonstrate cortical abnormality phantom pain may maintain abnormal peripheral input , suggest peripheral nerve block extend duration—lasting many day rather hours—may permanently reorganize cortical pain mapping , thus provide last relief phantom pain . A `` continuous peripheral nerve block '' ( CPNB ) involve percutaneous insertion catheter directly adjacent peripheral nerve supply affected limb . Local anesthetic infuse via catheter ( ) induce completely insensate extremity long desire without systemic side effect . Additionally , CPNB may provide ambulatory basis use small , portable pump infuse local anesthetic . Objective . To determine ambulatory CPNB effective treatment intractable phantom limb pain follow traumatic limb amputation . Previously-published small , uncontrolled series describe patient immediately follow surgical amputation whose phantom limb pain dramatically decrease completely resolve CPNB . We data randomize , double-masked , placebo-controlled , crossover pilot study suggest great promise treat intractable phantom limb pain ambulatory CPNB : participant ( n=3 ) experience change phantom pain follow 6-day infusion normal saline ; however , 6-day CPNB potent local anesthetic administer 4 month later , subject ( n=2 ; one patient return duty crossover infusion ) experience complete resolution phantom limb pain . Within 12-week follow-up period , one subject experience phantom pain recurrence ; subject report mild pain occur week small fraction original pain . Specific Aims . The primary hypothesis phantom limb pain intensity significantly decrease 4 week follow ambulatory CPNB ( measure Numeric Rating Scale Brief Pain Inventory ) . Study Design . We propose multicenter , randomize , double-masked , placebo-controlled , simultaneous parallel crossover , human-subjects clinical trial . We include subject exist upper low amputation experience phantom limb pain least daily previous 4 week . Catheter site ( ) determine amputation location . Subjects randomize receive one two study solution double-masked manner : either local anesthetic ( ropivacaine 0.5 % ) placebo ( normal saline ) . Catheters remove 6 day at-home infusion . Although require , subject option return alternative treatment four week later ( crossover infusion ) . The primary endpoint difference average phantom pain intensity baseline 4 week follow initial infusion measure Numeric Rating Scale treatment group initial infusion . Major secondary endpoint involve intra- inter-subject comparison additional measure pain health-related quality-of-life . Clinical Impact . From 2001-2006 , 70 % U.S. military casualty endure major limb injury , amputation rate 28 % within Operation Enduring Freedom alone . Previous conflict leave tens-of-thousands United States Armed Forces Veterans miss limb . CPNB relatively ubiquitous within United States , apply nearly exclusively provide acute post-injury/surgical analgesia . If propose study demonstrate ambulatory CPNB reliable treatment intractable phantom limb pain , result impact treat consequence traumatic amputation immediate profound , healthcare provider within United States Armed Forces Veterans Affairs Medical Centers already expertise place manage perineural catheter . Currently , CPNB provide exclusively acute setting—to treat pain immediately follow battlefield injury surgery—and chronic , intractable phantom limb pain . However , little technical difference provide CPNB acute versus chronic pain , thousand U.S. Veterans active duty personnel suffer intractable phantom pain could treat relatively easily , rapidly , negligible additional cost .</detailed_description>
