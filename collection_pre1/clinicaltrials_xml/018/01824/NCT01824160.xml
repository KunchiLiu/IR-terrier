	<brief_summary>The Covered Cheatham-Platinum Stent ( CCPS ) study repair tear occur pulmonary artery dilation ( enlargement ) conduit ( passageway ) connect right ventricle heart pulmonary artery . Patients undergoing replacement pulmonary valve transcatheter technique Melody Valve ) risk develop tear process prepare conduit accept new valve . In order implant valve , connection right ventricle pulmonary artery often need enlarge . High pressure balloon may need balloon sometimes cause tear even rupture connect conduit . Such tear allow blood flow chest rarely lead life-threatening emergency . Experience suggest tear close implant conduit metallic stent outer cover , rebuild wall allow continuation valve implant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Recent clinical report multiple pediatric cardiology program around world indicate conduit repair use stent . In United States commercially available , FDA approve , cover stent size require . The Covered Cheatham Platinum Stent ( CCPS ) manufacture NuMED Corporation Hopkinton , New York use Europe since 2003 recently Canada . The CCPS device yet approve Food &amp; Drug Administration ( FDA ) . However , use many hospital U.S. repair Right Ventricle pulmonary artery conduit Emergency Compassionate Use circumstance . The NuMED Covered Cheatham-Platinum Stent ( CCPS ) currently study use area body . The investigator study use RV-PA conduit . The use Covered Cheatham Platinum Stent research study investigational . Only patient find conduit tear Melody Valve implant procedure eligible inclusion trial . Implant technique leave catheterization physician . Clinical data obtain catheterization , CCPS implant study order understand factor lead tear evaluate successful CCPS repairing defect . Melody valve implant patient routinely see clinical echocardiographic reevaluation 6 month implant . Patients receive CCPS Melody valve procedure likewise see . Results clinical evaluation review make sure presence CCPS diminish effectiveness Melody valve . Finally , catheterization angiogram 6 month follow echocardiogram review independent expert confirm clinical reading .</detailed_description>
