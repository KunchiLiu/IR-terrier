	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well give temozolomide without capecitabine work treat patient advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor . Drugs use chemotherapy , temozolomide capecitabine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . It yet know whether temozolomide effective without capecitabine treat patient advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Temozolomide With Without Capecitabine Treating Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression-free survival ( PFS ) associate temozolomide alone temozolomide capecitabine patient advance pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response rate ( RR ) associate temozolomide alone temozolomide capecitabine treatment patient advance pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor . II . To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) associate temozolomide alone temozolomide capecitabine patient advance pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor . III . To evaluate toxicity associate temozolomide alone temozolomide capecitabine treatment patient advance pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor . IV . To evaluate usefulness methyl guanine methyltransferase ( MGMT ) status ( immunohistochemistry [ IHC ] promoter methylation ) predict response pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor patient treat either temozolomide temozolomide capecitabine . V. To bank radiology image evaluation quality , reproducibility , compliance compute tomography ( CT ) methodology . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive temozolomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 13 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients receive capecitabine PO twice daily ( BID ) day 1-14 temozolomide PO QD day 10-14 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 13 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
