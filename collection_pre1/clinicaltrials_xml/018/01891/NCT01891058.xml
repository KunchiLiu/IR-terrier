	<brief_summary>Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) atrial flutter ( AFL ) cardiac rhythm problem irregular , rapid heart rate . Investigators plan study Emergency Department ( ED ) patient recent-onset episode AF AFL ( RAFF ) rapid heart rate require urgent treatment restore normal heart rhythm . RAFF common rhythm disorder manage ED . Investigators recently show doctor use wide variety treatment approach Canadian EDs RAFF . Also , Canadian Cardiovascular Society Guidelines indicate enough study know best treatment use electrical shock ( Shock Only ) drug follow shock ( Drug-Shock ) . Investigators believe Drug-Shock approach effective help avoid electric shock many patient . Investigators also know electrical shock give electrode pad front ( antero-lateral ) front back ( antero-posterior ) . Investigators intend conduct 2 randomized protocol within one study ( partial factorial design ) order answer two question . 1 . Will initial drug treatment follow electrical shock necessary ( Drug-Shock ) lead patient convert normal heart rhythm strategy electrical shock ( Shock Only ) ? 2 . Will antero-posterior pad position effective antero-lateral position ? Investigators plan enroll 468 RAFF patient 8 large Canadian EDs . Patients randomize 1 2 arm two protocol . Investigators primary outcome conversion normal heart rhythm . Other outcome include heart rhythm discharge , need hospital admission , length stay ED , adverse event , patient satisfaction , 14-day follow-up status . Investigator result add important information best safest way treat RAFF patient Canadian EDs . Ultimately Investigators expect see few patient admit hospital patient rapidly safely return normal activity .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Electrical Versus Pharmacological Cardioversion RAFF ED</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) characterize disorganize atrial electrical depolarization lead irregular rapid heart rate common arrhythmia see emergency department ( ED ) . Atrial flutter ( AFL ) less common arrhythmia similar pathophysiology . Investigators focus recent-onset episode AF AFL ( RAFF ) , usually present less 48 hour , highly symptomatic , may first recurrent event . There surprising lack evidence regard many important ED RAFF management question 2011 Canadian Cardiovascular Society AF Guidelines indicate clinical equipoise facet early care . In Canadian EDs , physicians use rhythm control approach , attempt make cardiovert patient sinus rhythm ED , either pharmacologically electrically ( DC cardioversion ) . Canadian ED physicians seem equally divide prefer attempt rhythm control initially drug move DC cardioversion necessary ( Drug-Shock strategy ) prefer start immediately DC cardioversion ( Shock Only strategy ) . Investigators recently complete prospective cohort RAFF study ( N=1,065 , fund Heart Stroke Foundation Ontario ) 6 Canadian EDs . 73.3 % patient underwent ED rhythm control 34.4 % receive rhythm control drug first 38.9 % receive electrical shock first . There also much variation whether DC cardioversion electrode place front back ( antero-posterior ) front side ( antero-lateral ) position ( Figure 1 ) . Investigators believe Drug-Shock strategy many advantage Shock Only strategy . Most Canadian EDs single physician duty , barrier safe procedural sedation DC cardioversion . Even large EDs , DC cardioversion require 4 professional staff , risk associate sedation , frighten patient . Investigators expect Drug-Shock strategy effective procainamide facilitate DC cardioversion prevent early return AF . Even Drug-Shock strategy effective overall , use prevent need DC cardioversion 50-60 % patient . Regarding DC cardioversion pad placement , randomize trial ever do RAFF patient use modern biphasic device high energy level . Study Objectives : Investigators primary aim compare conversion sinus rhythm strategy ) attempt pharmacological cardioversion intravenous procainamide follow DC cardioversion necessary ( Drug-Shock ) ii ) DC cardioversion alone ( Shock Only ) . Investigators secondary aim compare effectiveness ) antero-posterior ii ) antero-lateral pad position . Methods : Design Interventions : Investigators propose partial factorial study design 2 protocol ( Figure 2 ) . All patient participate Protocol 1 ( N=468 ) Protocol 2 ( N=356 ) . 1 . Drug versus Shock Protocol . This randomized , blind , placebo-controlled comparison : ) attempt pharmacological cardioversion intravenous procainamide ( 15mg/kg 30 minute ) follow DC cardioversion ( 200 joule x 3 ) necessary ( Drug-Shock ) , ii ) DC cardioversion ( Shock Only ) ( Hypothesis 1 ) . 2 . Pad Position Protocol . For subset patient undergo DC cardioversion , randomize , open-label comparison ) antero-posterior pad position , ii ) antero-lateral pad position ( Hypothesis 2 ) . Management protocols standardize . Randomization stratify site rhythm ( AF AFL ) . Setting : 8 EDs large , tertiary care Canadian hospital . Subjects : Stable patient primary diagnosis RAFF acute rhythm control safe option . Investigators obtain patient consent . Outcomes : The primary outcome measure conversion sinus rhythm maintenance sinus rhythm least 60 minute ; outcome include sinus rhythm discharge , hospital admission , length stay ED , adverse event , patient satisfaction , 14-day follow-up status . Patients telephone 6 month 1 year original ED visit determine stroke-free status medication change . Data Analysis : Primary analysis intention-to-treat use chi-square testing . Sample Size : Investigators require 213 evaluable patient per group detect minimal clinically important absolute difference 10 % group . Allowing 10 % non-compliance , investigator plan enroll 468 patient . Importance : This study answer two important question early management ED RAFF patient , lead high rhythm conversion rate low admission rate . The result inform future effort create effective , safe , efficient pathway RAFF patient management Canada .</detailed_description>
