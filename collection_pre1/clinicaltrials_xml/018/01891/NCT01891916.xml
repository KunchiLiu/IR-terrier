	<brief_summary>Food allergy ( FA ) , define adverse immune response food allergen , among frequent allergic disorder childhood recognize major paediatric health problem due severity reaction dramatic increase past decade . Cow 's milk allergy ( CMA ) frequent FA child worldwide , demonstrate could first manifestation so-called `` atopic march '' , characterize occurrence allergic disorder subsequent year onset CMA . In previous study , involve child CMA period 5 year , 40 % developed asthma , 21 % atopic eczema , 43 % allergic rhinitis . Similar result report recent study Finnish child Intestinal microflora appear crucial role development atopic disorder . Children atopic diseases different commensal bacterial group gut compare non-atopic child , difference also find country high low incidence atopic disease . There currently great interest manipulate normal microbiota accrue health benefit approach know `` probiotic . '' Probiotics define `` live microorganism administer adequate amount confer health benefit host '' . The conceptual basis possible use probiotic prevention treatment atopic disorder well ground . Lactobacillus GG ( LGG ) study probiotic prevention treatment atopic disorder . Wide well-designed clinical study provide several evidence efficacy LGG preventive therapeutic strategy pediatric atopic disorder . More recently , vitro study provide evidence potent immunoregulatory role influence intestinal microflora composition ( toward beneficial composition prevention treatment atopic disorder ) elicit LGG . This view reinforce recent research show LGG able improve recovery intestinal symptom infant CMA-induced allergic colitis .</brief_summary>
