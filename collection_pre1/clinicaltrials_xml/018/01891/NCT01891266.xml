	<brief_summary>Background : Osteoarthritis ( OA ) common joint disease cause symptomatic health problem elderly population . For patient knee OA , total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) may option offer possibility reestablish patient 's life quality . Surgery TKA usually take place complete bloodless field establish tourniquet around thigh . The method aim reduce blood loss give surgeon well visibility operation . The method , however , without side effect patient often experience severe pain swollen leg time surgery . Furthermore , method show decidedly muscle- nerve damage follow prolonged rehabilitation reduce physical function . It , however , possible perform operation without use tourniquet . Aim hypothesis : The aim present study assess effect tourniquet use TKA physical function , early rehabilitation , pain opioid consumption . Hypotheses H1 : TKA without tourniquet lead well physical function early rehabilitation . H2 : TKA without tourniquet cause less pain opioid consumption H3 : Recovery mechanical low limb function post TKA faster without use tourniquet . Methods : 80 patient ( 40 group ) eligible TKA consecutively recruit randomize A ) TKA without tourniquet , B ) TKA tourniquet . Subjects evaluated operation ( baseline ) 14 day , 3 , 6 12 month operation . The primary outcome change baseline 3 month self-administered knee-function ( KOOS-ADL subscale ) . Further , examine number pre-specified secondary outcome , include self-rated knee-related pain , symptom , difficulty sport leisure activity , quality life . In addition , muscle function , physical performance , use pain medication study Impact project : The project design study enable analysis determine impact operate without tourniquet whether intervention fact improve physical function , performance quality life within TKA patient . The result may impact notably patient level possible redefine current surgical strategy . The societal perspective project remobilize patient faster , may reduce hospital service absence work .</brief_summary>
