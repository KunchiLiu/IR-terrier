	<brief_title>ACE Inhibitors Combined With Exercise Seniors - Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An initial telephone screen indicate eligibility participate study . The first study visit ( `` Screening visit '' ) determine eligibility participate . If eligible fully participate , study consist structured physical activity program 24 week . In addition , take daily medication control blood pressure come clinic several additional assessment visit monitor safety measure study outcomes . This physical activity program include moderate-intensity walking , lower-body strengthening , flexibility , balance training . For first 12 week , participation three ( 3 ) physical activity session per week physical activity center . These session lead investigator study staff . These session use begin walk program introduce participant strength , stretching , balance part program safe manner . This allow instructor well tailor program individual need ability . These session involve 40-60 minute physical activity instruction . For final 12 week intervention , two ( 2 ) session per week . Participants also engage home-based walking twice per week . This walk do home , community-based physical activity center ( YMCA , senior center , church , etc . ) , appropriate facility desire . Participants ask report number minute walk week . Participants randomly assign take one three medication continue treat blood pressure . These medication Perindopril , Losartan , Hydrochlorothiazide . Each medication represent separate type medication commonly use practice . These medication standard , FDA-approved medication treatment blood pressure . During time participate study , use normal blood pressure medication replace medication assign study . The medication insert identical capsule study pharmacy neither participant investigator know medication use . Study staff monitor blood pressure study supervision board-certified cardiologist , necessary adjustment medication indicate physician . Participants also provide blood pressure monitor use home study ask check blood pressure day report abnormal value study staff . This monitor also automatically record blood pressure reading . Please bring monitor assessment visit study staff download store blood pressure reading .</detailed_description>
