	<detailed_description>Sickle cell anemia disease result inheritance two hemoglobin S ( Hb S ) gene . Sickle-cell anemia individual refer Hb SS patient , know suffer variety life-threatening symptom . Paramount clinical complication sickle cell patient `` sickle-cell crisis '' . If crisis stop prompt medical attention , may result death . It become increasingly clear sickle cell anemic patient benign clinical profile others . The genetic reason clinical difference well determine : although mutation change `` normal '' hemoglobin gene patient , genetic material outside gene influence gene express . This genetic material refer beta-globin haplotype . Carriers sickle cell gene refer Hb AS individual . Hb AS carrier usually normal life free clinical problem associate disease suffer sickle cell patient . However , become increasingly clear strenuous situation , Hb AS carrier experience heat illness life threaten problem others . The purpose project determine genetic reason athlete carrier sickle cell trait experience heat illness , others . Although genetic reason different clinical outcome sickle cell anemic patient well understood ( different haplotype result different disease course ) , possibility haplotype might reason sickle cell carrier worse clinical profile never explore . In project work sickle-cell trait registry athlete , test haplotype Hb AS athlete heat illness . Our study first attempt clarify genetic reason occurrence . Total participation time study thirty minute less . Information provide participant analyze within one year participation . Deidentified result keep five year , per University South Florida 's Institutional Review Board protocol , available upon request principal investigator . Participants complete study half hour privacy home .</detailed_description>
