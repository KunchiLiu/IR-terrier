	<brief_title>Evaluating Two Types Cognitive Training Veterans With Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia disorder affect higher-level neurocognitive operation ( e.g. , verbal memory , executive functioning ) lower-level perceptual process ( e.g. , auditory processing ) . These deficit contribute poor community outcome severe functional disability see patient . Effectively treat cognitive dysfunction associate illness important achieve improvement daily functioning . Recent meta-analytic study report cognitive training schizophrenia moderate effect-size impact cognitive function low impact daily functioning . However , train intervention schizophrenia target higher-order cognitive process . A recent intervention target basic perceptual processing show auditory visual perceptual ability train improved patient schizophrenia . These finding suggest basic perceptual processing may ideal target intervention . At point , still unclear whether neuroplasticity-based , bottom-up intervention effective intervention target top-down function like attention , work memory , executive functioning . This clinical trial contrast bottom-up intervention target basic auditory process top-down intervention target higher-order cognitive function , compare control condition , Veterans schizophrenia . These intervention assess effect representative measure three outcome domain : 1 ) neurocognition , 2 ) electroencephalography ( EEG ) , 3 ) functional capacity . Participants randomly assign bottom-up auditory training , top-down cognitive training , control treatment ( commercial computer game ) . All treatment administer three time week ( 1 hour ) 12 week . A comprehensive battery cognitive , electrophysiological , functional measure administer baseline , 6 week , completion treatment . The investigator enroll 120 Veterans schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder across 5 year study . This study determine train approach lead large magnitude improvement neurocognition , functional capacity , neural functioning measure EEG . Moreover , shed light neural mechanism underlie response training . By determine whether beneficial treat lower-level perceptual process higher-level cognitive function , result project inform future recovery-based cognitive remediation intervention Veterans schizophrenia .</detailed_description>
