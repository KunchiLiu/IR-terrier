	<brief_summary>Background : - Eltrombopag drug test treat severe aplastic anemia . It help improve blood count patient . However , researcher know long drug take type anemia . Objectives : - To look whether 6 month treatment eltrombopag improve patient blood count . Eligibility : - Individuals least 2 year age take eltrombopag severe aplastic anemia . Design : - Participants take eltrombopag mouth day 6 month . - Blood sample collect every 2 week first 6 month . Bone marrow sample collect 3 6 month . These sample look effect study drug marrow . - Participants continue take study drug long effective side effect severe .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extended Dosing With Eltrombopag Severe Aplastic Anemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe aplastic anemia ( SAA ) life-threatening blood disease successfully treat immunosuppressive drug regimen allogeneic stem cell transplantation . However , 20-40 % patient ineligible transplant due lack appropriate donor , age , comorbidities . Immunosuppression broadly utilize , 1/3 patient respond single course horse ATG cyclosporine persistent severe cytopenia . Among patient respond immunosuppression , response may partial , persistent thrombocytopenia , neutropenia , and/or anemia . About 30 % respond patient either relapse dependent continue cyclosporine administration . Patients refractory severe cytopenia risk die infection bleeding , require regular platelet and/or red blood cell transfusion , expensive inconvenient , Patients refractory SAA also risk progression hematologic disorder , include myelodysplasia leukemia . Thrombopoietin ( TPO ) first identify principal protein regulate platelet production , stimulate proliferation megakaryocyte release platelet . TPO later show stimulate proliferation primitive bone marrow stem progenitor cell vitro animal model , suggest could impact production red white blood cell well platelet . The 2nd generation oral small molecule TPO-agonist eltrombopag ( Promacta ) show increase platelet healthy subject thrombocytopenic patient chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) -infection . Eltrombopag well-tolerated clinical trial , unlike recombinant TPO , induce autoantibody . Eltrombopag receive FDA accelerate approval November 20 , 2008 treatment thrombocytopenia patient chronic immune ( idiopathic ) thrombocytopenic purpura insufficient response corticosteroid , immunoglobulin , splenectomy . In November 2012 , FDA approval receive hepatitis C associate thrombocytopenia . We conduct pilot dose find study patient severe aplastic anemia refractory thrombocytopenia follow standard immunosuppressive therapy . Patients begin dose 50 mg/day escalate every two week maximum dose 150 mg/day . We report 11 25 patient ( 44 % ) achieve hematological response least one lineage follow 12 week dose-escalating eltrombopag therapy , minimal toxicity . Responding patient assess 12 week invite continue drug extension phase . With median follow-up 27 month drug , 7 eventually become tri-lineage responder . Nine become transfusion-independent platelet ( median increase platelet count 34,000/micro l ) , six improve hemoglobin level ( median increase 3.8g/dL ) , include three previously dependent red cell transfusion achieve transfusion-independence , eight exhibit increase neutrophil count ( median increase 590 cells/mico L ) . Serial bone marrow biopsy demonstrate normalization tri-lineage hematopoiesis responder , without increase fibrosis . In previous study , response assessment occur 12 week , patient fulfil response criterion time drug discontinue . Several patient begin detectable change transfusion requirement blood count 12 week , fulfill response criterion time point therefore discontinue eltrombopag . Other patient barely meet response criterion 12 week show marked improvement blood count lineages extension phase , case reach maximal response one year initiate eltrombopag . We hypothesize large fraction patient may respond eltrombopag continue longer 12 week . We , therefore propose follow-up Phase 2 study give eltrombopag treatment 24 week prior definitive response assessment , initiate study medication fix dose 150 mg/day ( 75 mg /day individual East Asian ethnicity ) , give lack toxicity dose prior study , evidence response patient dose escalation prior reach dose . Responses assess three lineage . Subjects platelet , red cell , and/or neutrophil responses 24 week may continue study medication ( extended access ) meet study criterion . The primary objective ass efficacy 6 month eltrombopag administration improve bone marrow function SAA patient persistent severe cytopenia refractory treatment immunosuppressive treatment . Secondary objective include assessment relapse clonal evolution , pre-treatment characteristic predict response , impact treatment treatment response quality life .</detailed_description>
