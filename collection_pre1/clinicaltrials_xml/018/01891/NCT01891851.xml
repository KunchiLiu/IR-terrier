	<brief_title>A Study Drug-drug Interaction Between Ritonavir TMC435350 Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial Phase I , open label trial ( mean research physician study participant know medication administer trial ) 12 healthy volunteer ( referred participant ) investigate effect ritonavir , market product use several HIV medication , plasma level TMC435350 , new investigational drug process development treatment hepatitis-C virus ( HCV ) infection . TMC435350 protease inhibitor ( PI ) , class drug selectively inhibit replication virus thereby inhibit progression HCV infection . Plasma level TMC435350 circulating level TMC435350 blood important antiviral activity TMC435350 . Ritonavir ability increase circulating level compound administer day Ritonavir . The trial consist 2 sequential session ( Session 1 Session 2 ) participant enrol study enter session . In Session 1 , participant take TMC435350 200mg orally ( mouth ) daily 7 day . There wait period least 7 day allow drug leave body last treatment Session 1 eliminate start Session 2 ( refer `` washout period '' ) . In Session 2 , participant take ritonavir 100 mg orally twice daily Days 1 15 TMC435350 200mg daily Days 6 12 . All study drug treatment session take fed condition ( i. e. , participant eat standard breakfast within approximately 30 minute take study drug ) . Full pharmacokinetic profile TMC435350 ( investigate drug move body , include absorption , distribution , metabolism elimination drug ) determine blood sample obtain Days 1 7 Session 1 Days 6 12 Session 2 . Safety tolerability record continuously . The total duration treatment study participant approximately 30 day ( include 7 day treatment Session 1 , 16 day treatment Session 2 , washout period least 7 day treatment session ) .</detailed_description>
