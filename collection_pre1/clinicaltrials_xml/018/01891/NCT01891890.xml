	<brief_summary>Seizures arise specific area brain call Localization Related Epilepsy ( LRE ) common seizure disorder child . Children receive drug treatment disorder may suffer treatment related side effect impact ability think concentrate ability interact socially . These negative treatment effect impact child 's performance school long term may impact employment job option . This study determine whether change attention social interaction see child treat LRE use three common medication use treat pediatric LRE . Children newly diagnose LRE doctor 6-12 year age randomize receive levetiracetam , lamotrigine , oxcarbazepine . There 12 study site throughout US . Children undergo evaluation think ability pay attention start drug treatment LRE . Regardless specific finding , result study provide information need help parent clinicians choose treatment option maximize cognitive ability child LRE , provide data need practice guideline establish basis cognitive side effect risk .</brief_summary>

Localization relate seizure base upon least one following : 1 ) focal EEG abnormality ( sharp wave , spike , slow ) absence generalize spike wave discharge , 2 ) focal MRI abnormality active cysticercosis , may include temporal lobe sclerosis , dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor , ganglioglioma , focal malformation cortical development , 3 ) focal neurologic abnormality , 4 ) clinical semiology , may include Todd 's phenomenon , unilateral dystonia , fence posture , distinct aura consistent localization relate seizure onset ( e.g. , classic déjà vu bad smell ) . Participants must either AED therapy naïve AED ( exclude benzodiazepine ) 1week less . Children may stable dose psychostimulants time enrollment , change medication , dose , schedule 3 month prior study enrollment , anticipate dosing change 6 month study .
