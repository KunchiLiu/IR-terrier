	<brief_title>Bortezomib Low Intermediate-1 Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS ) With p65 Activation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , receive bortezomib injection skin Days 1 , 4 , 8 , 11 21-day cycle . Study Visits : At visit , ask drug may take side effect may . One ( 1 ) time week Cycle 1 , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . On Day 21 Cycles 1 3 , bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy check status disease cytogenetic testing . On Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . If doctor think need , may additional bone aspiration and/or biopsy check status disease and/or cytogenetic testing . Length Treatment : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , able allogeneic stem cell transplant ( stem cell transplant donor ) , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of- treatment visit . End-of-Treatment Visit : At 30 day last dose study drug : - You ask drug may take side effect may . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , bone marrow aspirate and/or biopsy check status disease cytogenetic testing . This investigational study . Bortezomib FDA approve commercially available treat multiple myeloma mantle cell lymphoma . Giving patient MDS investigational . Up 40 participant enrol study .
