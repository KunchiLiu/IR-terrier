	<detailed_description>The CONSORT ( Consolidated Standards Reporting Trials ) Statement ( www.consort-statement.org ) evidence base guideline aim improve report randomize controlled trial . If trial well report difficult clinician use best evidence inform clinical practice patient may get best care . A number different CONSORT extension develop specify additional information need complex trials.We conduct multicentre randomize controlled trial evaluate whether use simple web-based tool ( WebCONSORT ) improve completeness report clinical trial . To eligible inclusion study journal must publish report randomize trial endorse CONSORT Statement ( e.g . refer journal website ) actively implement ( e.g . require author submit complete CONSORT checklist time manuscript submission . Participating journal ask author register manuscript ( revision stage manuscript ) WebCONSORT website randomize one two group ( i.e . intervention control ) . In intervention group , author direct WebCONSORT tool . The tool allow author combine different extension relevant trial generate list item flowchart specific trial design type intervention test . The checklist item generate WebCONSORT tool report revised paper complete checklist flow diagram submit journal along revised manuscript.In control group , author direct different version WebCONSORT tool . This tool include flowchart part WEBCONSORT tool main checklist element relate CONSORT extension . The primary outcome measure percentage poorly report methodological item submit manuscript . Secondary outcome include time spent WEBCONSORT website , rejection rate study , feedback author compliance rate . It anticipate web-based tool lead improvement report transparency trial finding , thus aid critical appraisal interpretation reader .</detailed_description>
