	<brief_title>Study Moxetumomab Pasudotox Patients With Relapsed and/or Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia ( ALL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 4 group 3-6 participant enrol Phase 1 portion study . If Phase 1 , dose moxetumomab pasudotox receive depend join study . The first group receive low dose level moxetumomab pasudotox . Each additional group receive high dose previous group , intolerable side effect see . If Phase 2 , receive high dose moxetumomab pasudotox find safe Phase 1 portion study . Study Drug Administration : You receive moxetumomab pasudotox vein Days 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 21-day cycle . You may treat hospital first cycle . If doctor think need , length study cycle may change . You may receive drug control side effect one hour dose study drug 12 hour dose study drug . You may also receive fluid hydration dose study drug . Study Visits : Every week Cycle 1 , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . Within 1 week Day 1 study cycle : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - If doctor think need , eye exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw test drug antibody . On Day 1 ( 1st dose ) Cycle 1 , right first dose study drug 4-5 time next 8 hour , blood ( 1/2 teaspoon time ) drawn pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . At 6th dose , blood ( 1/2 teaspoon time ) drawn right dose study drug PK testing . PK test 1st 6th dose repeat Cycle 2 every 4th treatment cycle end treatment . If doctor think disease respond study drug , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn least 1 time every week routine test . Between Days 14-21 ( +/- 7 day ) Cycle 1 , bone marrow biopsy/aspiration . You additional bone marrow biopsy/aspirations every 2-4 cycle , every 3 month 1 year follow-up period . At end cycle , urine collect routine test . After last dose study drug , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw test drug antibody . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . If doctor think disease respond , may receive 6 cycle . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit . Follow-Up Visit : About 30 day last dose study drug , ask return clinic follow-up test . During visit , may blood drawn test perform check status disease , test drug antibody , check health . If come MD Anderson , contact phone ask health . This investigational study . Moxetumomab pasudotox FDA approve commercially available . At time , use research purpose . Up 60 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
