	<brief_title>The Benefit Harm Fever Suppression Antipyretics Influenza</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Being one commonest condition encounter modern medical practice , fever commonly regarded illness treat , medical professional patient . However , objective convincing evidence lack naturally occur fever harmful , grow evidence fever may serve important host defense mechanism infection risk suppression may far outweigh apparent benefit . In acute respiratory infection include influenza , antipyretic commonly prescribe symptomatic treatment . Evidence different randomize controlled trial , however , challenge actual amount clinical benefit achievable fever suppression improve patient ' comfort behavior . On hand , evidence animal human challenge study suggest antipyretic therapy may actually prolong duration illness , suppress humoral antibody response , increase level duration viral shedding . The knowledge gap : Most currently available evidence harm benefit antipyretic treatment upper respiratory tract infection ( URTIs ) either experimental animal study , human challenge study various respiratory virus , randomize control trial ( RCTs ) patient fever presumed viral origin . There yet RCT investigate effect antipyretic clinical course , disease duration , pattern viral shed naturally occur acute URTIs viral origin human . Whereas acute URTIs cause range viral non-viral cause , influenza virus infection one leading cause , pathogenesis relatively well understood compare respiratory virus . Aim : To investigate potential benefit risk antipyretic use naturally occur influenza virus infection human . Design subject : The study double-blind , randomize control trial . Four hundred young adult age 18-30 year recruit present symptom acute respiratory infection within 48 hour symptom onset university health clinic , test positive QuickVue rapid influenza test . They receive clinical consultation prescription indicate usual , randomized receive either paracetamol placebo , give back-up NSAID intolerable fever require . Blood specimen , nasal throat swab collect day ( day 1 ) . They followed-up day 4 , day 7 day 10 collection nasal throat swab , day 28 final blood taking . A symptom diary keep participant 10 day monitor clinical course infection . Potential significance : This first RCT investigate effect antipyretic clinical course , disease duration , pattern viral shed naturally occur influenza virus infection human . Findings study important contribution understanding role fever host defense mechanism , help inform appropriate clinical management approach human influenza virus infection .</detailed_description>
