	<detailed_description>In general public , certain sub-populations higher risk adverse health effect due air pollution exposure . Asthmatics identify one susceptible population due observe association elevate air pollution level increase incidence acute asthma exacerbation evidence decreased lung function value respiratory symptom , shortness breath , emergency department ( ED ) visit , hospitalization ( 6-13 ) . A study conduct Mar et al ( 2004 ) report health outcome associate coarse particulate matter ( PM2.5-10 ) notable child asthma adult asthma ( 14 ) large epidemiological study asthmatic child Northeastern US show asthma morbidity high ozone day consistently high among child age 6 18 year ( 15 ) . Furthermore , child persistent asthma ( require daily maintenance medication ) show increase risk respiratory symptom rescue medication use ambient ozone exposure compare child mild intermittent asthma ( 16 ) . Together , study demonstrate additional level susceptibility air pollution child compare adult child persistent asthma compare mild intermittent asthma . African-American patient appear particularly susceptible asthma-related complication , rate asthma-related emergency department visit , hospitalization , death approximately 2 3 time rate find Caucasian subject ( 17 ) . Furthermore , high proportion African-American asthmatic poorly-controlled asthma compare non-African-American asthmatic ( 18 ) . In recent pediatric study , poorly control asthmatic increase risk asthma-related hospitalization , emergency department visit , corticosteroid burst ( OR , 6.4 ; 95 % CI , 1.2-34.5 ) compare whose asthma good control 2-year period ( 19 ) . The goal panel study determine African-American child poorly-controlled moderate-to-severe persistent asthma increase risk cardiopulmonary effect result ambient air pollution exposure compare age- race-matched well-controlled moderate-to-severe asthmatic child . The primary cohort panel study African-American child age 12-17 year moderate-to-severe asthma ( divide study population poorly-controlled asthma well-controlled asthma ) . Since study exclusively focus African-American population , design address effect race/ethnicity baseline asthma control . Volunteers recruit primarily UNC Pediatric Pulmonary clinic UNC Allergy/Immunology clinic locate Rex Hospital Raleigh , NC Dr. Hernandez attend physician . These volunteer well-characterized asthmatic follow regularly pediatric pulmonologist ( Dr. Ceila Loughlin ) pediatric allergist ( Dr. Michelle Hernandez ) Rex location . In order ensure two cohort experience equivalent daily exposure ambient air pollutant , study population recruit defined geographical region within reasonable drive distance Rex Hospital relative proximity state-operated monitoring station ambient air pollutant . Establishing relationship asthma control adverse health outcome response air pollution exposure provide health care provider parent child moderate-to-severe asthma information necessary take proactive action high air pollution day communicate public color-coded day base National Ambient Air Quality Standards ( NAAQS ) establish EPA . If asthma control determine study risk factor susceptibility , future work direct toward establish mechanism underlie susceptibility may lead potential design new therapy intervention strategy .</detailed_description>
