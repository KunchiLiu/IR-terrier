	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine novel oral agent VT-1161 safe effective treating patient moderate - severe tinea pedis ( also refer athlete foot ) . VT-1161 design inhibit CYP51 , enzyme essential fungal growth . Inhibition CYP51 result accumulation chemical know toxic fungus . CYP51 molecular target class drug refer 'azole antifungal ' . All currently approve azole drug poor selectivity CYP51 result many side effect associate azole antifungal . The safety profile class similarly limit use chronic treatment non-life-threatening fungal infection .
