	<brief_summary>The amount active therapy provide patient inpatient stroke rehabilitation unit report often insufficient . Observational study find first 14 day post stroke , patient receive little therapy low activity level . More opportunity practice may , however , improve short-term outcome level mobility , endurance , use affect arm leg , length stay . The Stroke Inpatient Rehabilitation Reinforcement ACTivity ( SIRRACT ) trial utilize sensor reveal type , quantity , aspects quality patient activity outside confines research laboratory . SIRRACT deploy inexpensive Personal Activity Monitors ( PAMs ) , comprise triaxial accelerometer wear thigh . The objective study : . To assess impact feedback Personal Activity Monitors ( PAM ) amount active practice , walk speed distance stroke patient undergoing rehabilitation . ii . To assess impact feedback PAMs physical , psycho-emotional , cognitive ecosocial Health-Related Quality Life stroke patient undergoing rehabilitation . iii . To assess acceptability thigh-strapped accelerometer use among stroke patient undergoing rehabilitation . iv . To assess reliability validity thigh-strapped accelerometer use among stroke patient undergoing rehabilitation . Hypotheses In moderate severely disabled subject receive in-patient rehabilitation , daily feedback PAMs purposeful activity increase amount active practice &gt; 30 % , high proportion subject reach level independence walking , increase walk speed 25 % , lead high mean walking speed distance time discharge inpatient rehabilitation . Daily feedback PAMs increase walk speed distance improve physical , psychological , cognitive ecosocial domain Health-related quality life .</brief_summary>
