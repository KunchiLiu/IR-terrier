	<brief_summary>The Neo-PREDICT-HER2 Study phase II trial validate predictive marker response evaluation combine chemo-immunotherapy patient HER2-positive early breast cancer . The treatment arm consist Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 weekly 12 week lapatinib 750 mg P.O . daily trastuzumab 2 mg/kg IV ( load dose 4 mg/kg ) weekly 12 week .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Validate Markers Response Evaluation Combined Therapy Patients With HER2+ Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trastuzumab ( T ) -containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy report increase probability pathological complete response ( pCR ) HER2 positive disease 67 % . Large trial reveal pCR rate ( remain invasive situ component ) 30-40 % , anthracyclines/taxane base polychemotherapy apply 40-45 % invasive tumor breast lymph node use pCR definition . Nevertheless , resistance trastuzumab remain one important challenge adjuvant metastatic breast cancer therapy cause poor prognosis increase incidence cerebral metastasis limit therapeutic option disease progression6 . An improvement show combination trastuzumab lapatinib , report increased efficacy in-vitro metastatic setting patient mostly resistant therapy previous course disease . Recent data neoadjuvant setting ( neoALTTO ) - paclitaxel backbone - show significantly high pCR rate L + T either compound separately ( 47 % vs. 20 % 27.6 % respectively ) . Several trial plan evaluate combination therapy adjuvant neoadjuvant setting . Clinical response measure sequential evaluation different proliferation marker ( Ki-67 ) follow course neoadjuvant chemotherapy demonstrate correlate significantly increase risk relapse patient achieve pathological complete response . It therefore clinically relevant evaluate proliferation tool early prediction combination therapy efficacy ( chemotherapy HER2 target therapy ) . So far , remain unclear method proliferation measurement optimal marker response evaluation regard combine chemo-immunotherapy . However , measurement proliferation apoptosis gene well assessment change Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases ( PI3K ) , Protein Kinase B ( AKT ) , Insulin-like Growth Factor ( IGF ) stem cell signal short course therapy could provide unique signature dynamic response evaluation . The planned trial validate predictive marker dynamic model base sequential evaluation different proliferation apoptosis marker . Furthermore assess pCR-rate 12 week therapy . The aim study define predictive marker response evaluation combine chemo-immunotherapy .</detailed_description>
