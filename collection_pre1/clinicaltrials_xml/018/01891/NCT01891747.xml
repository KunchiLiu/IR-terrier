	<brief_summary>This Phase I/II non-randomized prospective study high-dose L-methylfolate combination bevacizumab temozolomide patient recurrent high-grade glioma . The primary objective phase II trial determine whether addition high-dose L-methylfolate bevacizumab temozolomide therapy improve progression-free survival ( PFS ) compare previously report result .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase I/II Study High-dose L-methylfolate Combination With Temozolomide Bevacizumab Recurrent High Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The phase I part study complete determine Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) high-dose L-methylfolate combination bevacizumab 10mg/kg IV every 14 day , 5-day regimen per month temozolomide 150 mg/m2/day 250 mg tablet vitamin C. Dose escalation involve 3 patient treat dose level L-methylfolate ( 15mg , 30 mg , 60 mg 90 mg ) , MTD confirm expansion 3 additional patient . It anticipate 6 15 patient enrol phase 1 part study . Patients continue treatment disease progression . Once MTD L-methylfolate determine , patient enrol low dose level may increase L-methylfolate dose MTD dose , per investigator discretion . The phase II part study consist patient take MTD L-methylfolate daily combination bevacizumab 10 mg/kg IV every 14 day , 5-day regimen per month temozolomide 150 mg/m2/day 250 mg tablet vitamin C. There 32 patient treated Phase II study patient continue treatment progression . The 6 patient treat MTD cohort Phase</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must histologically confirm malignant glioma ( anaplastic oligodendroglioma , anaplastic astrocytoma , anaplastic oligoastroctyoma glioblastoma ) . Patients must genetically confirm Isocitrate dehydrogenase I ( IDH1 ) wildtype tumor . Patients must measurable disease , define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension great equal 5 mm . Patients nonmeasurable disease recent surgery radiographic progression . Patients treated standard therapy high grade glioma , include surgical resection , chemoradiation temozolomide , adjuvant temozolomide bevacizumab . Patients receive experimental therapy high grade glioma . Patients must 18 year age old . Patients may breastfeed child . Patients must Karnofsky Performance Score great equal 60 percent . Patients must normal organ marrow function define : leukocyte great equal 3,000/milliliter ( mcL ) absolute neutrophil count great equal 1,500/mcL platelet great equal 100,000/mcL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit Aspartate transaminase ( serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase ) Alanine transaminase ( Serum Glutamic Pyruvate Transaminase ) less equal 2.5 time institutional upper limit normal Creatinine within normal institutional limit OR creatinine clearance great equal 60/mL/min 1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Patients must concurrent malignancy except curatively treat basal squamous cell carcinoma skin carcinoma situ cervix breast . Patients prior malignancy must diseasefree great equal 3 year . The effect highdose Lmethylfolate develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown , , evidence folic acid protective neural tube defect . However , concern folate supplementation increase incidence autism , thus woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , patient inform treat physician immediately . All woman pregnancy test perform prior enter trial . Patients must ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients must able tolerate MRIs . CT scan NOT substitute MRI study . Patients therapeutic warfarin enoxaparin eligible . Patients chemotherapy radiotherapy within 2 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enter study recover adverse event ( great grade I ) due agent administer 4 week earlier . Patients genetically confirm IDH1mutated tumor . Patients may receive investigational agent . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition folic acid . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , stage II hypertension , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Pregnant woman exclude study highdose folic acid potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother highdose folic acid breastfeed discontinue mother treat highdose folic acid . HIVpositive patient combination antiretroviral therapy ineligible potential pharmacokinetic interaction highdose folic acid . In addition , patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Appropriate study undertake patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy indicate .</criteria>
