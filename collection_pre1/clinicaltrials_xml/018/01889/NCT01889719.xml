	<brief_title>A Phase I Study Evaluate Safety Immunogenicity Heterologous Boost Immunizations With MVA-CMDR</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial investigate whether immunization MVA recombinant HIV vaccine safe whether boost immune response generate immunization dendritic cell ( DC ) target protein vaccine , DCVax-001 , plus poly ICLC healthy HIV-uninfected volunteer . Investigators propose assess quality immunity elicit immunization MVA-CMDR booster immunization MVA-CMDR volunteer previously immunize DC-targeted HIV vaccine . This vaccination regimen provide proof-of-concept DC target protein vaccine prime strong immune response therefore valuable combination vaccine modality HIV disease .</detailed_description>
