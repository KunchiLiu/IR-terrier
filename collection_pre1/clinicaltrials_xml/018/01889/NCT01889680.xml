The primary aim study determine value add ziv-aflibercept continuation regimen 5-FU/LV improve progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient metastatic colorectal cancer achieve least stable disease induction therapy . The secondary aim determine overall objective response rate ( complete , partial stable response ) Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST 1.1 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patient receive induction regimen mFOLFOX6 ( 5-FU 400 mg/m2 IV bolus Day 1 + leucovorin 400 mg/m2 IV Day 1 + oxaliplatin 85 mg/m2 IV Day 1 follow 5-FU 2400 mg/m2 continuous intravenous infusion ( CIV infusion ) 46 hour [ Day 1 2 ] ) + ziv-aflibercept ( 4 mg/kg Day 1 ) every 14 day 6 cycle . Patients attain stable disease well 6 cycle induction therapy randomize receive continuation regimen either 5-FU/LV + ziv-aflibercept IV [ 4 mg/kg Day 1 ] ) every 14 day , investigational arm ; 5-FU/LV alone every 14 day , control arm , disease progression . Toxicity grade accord National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events version 4.0 . Submission archive primary tumor tissue blood sample FC-8 correlative science study study requirement patient . Submissions include primary tumor specimens diagnostic biopsy sample another previous surgery blood sample collect start study therapy , prior start even numbered cycle therapy , ( i.e. , Cycles 2 , 4 , 6 ) time disease progression end study therapy . The total study accrual 120 patient period 24 month order provide 90 patient randomization continuation regimen . Patients randomize 2:1 receive continuation regimen 5-FU/LV + ziv-aflibercept ( Arm 2 , 60 patient ) 5-FU/LV alone ( Arm 1 , 30 patient ) . In arm , clinical response assess radiological examination every eight week continuation regimen course .</detailed_description>
