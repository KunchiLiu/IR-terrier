	<brief_summary>Patients previously untreated low tumor burden indolent Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma ( NHL ) receive either rituximab GA101 weekly 4 week follow re-staging determine response . Rituximab , anti-CD20 chimeric antibody , approve United States Food Drug Administration 1998 treatment patient relapse low-grade B-cell lymphoma . Clinically , four weekly dos rituximab proven well tolerated effective previously untreated well relapsed patient low-grade lymphoma . GA101 anti-CD20 humanize glyco-engineered monoclonal antibody . GA101 show increase antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) direct cell-death induction compare Rituximab . It possible GA101 may great efficacy rituximab . PrE0401 Sub-Study Evaluation Corrected QT ( QTc ) Interval Pharmacokinetic Parameters Patients Participating GA101 ( Obinutuzumab ) Approximately twenty-five patient randomize GA101 may participate sub-study .

	<brief_title>Phase II Randomized Trial Comparing GA101 Rituximab Untreated Low Tumor Burden Indolent Non-Hodgkin 's Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>According American Cancer Society , estimate approximately 70,800 individual diagnose non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma ( NHL ) 18,990 men woman die disease 2014 . The survival rate patient indolent NHL remain unchanged 1950s early 1990s , recent evidence suggest outcomes improve . Indolent NHL particular challenge incurable disease require multiple treatment ; yet relatively long survival elevate importance quality life associate treatment . Agents rituximab active patient low burden disease result high response rate durable remission patient . However , optimal therapeutic approach patient low-grade lymphoma low disease burden controversial conventional chemotherapy also result high rate response . Regardless whether patient receive immunotherapy , chemotherapy , combination thereof , unfortunately exhibit continue pattern disease relapse median survival newly diagnose patient 7-10 year . Rituximab GA101 target CD20 antigen . The CD20 antigen locate surface normal malignant B-cell lymphocyte . An attractive feature target CD20 hematopoietic stem cell , express great extent normal body tissue . Studies vitro show rituximab predominantly induce antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity ( ADCC ) , also bind complement directly induce apoptosis lymphoma cell . GA101 show increase ADCC relate improved binding GA101 different allotypes express natural killer cell monocytes . It also increase direct cell-death relate elbow hinge amino acid exchange Type II bind CD20 epitope . The safety GA101 NHL far appear similar observe rituximab patient NHL , except high incidence infusion-related reaction . Depletion malignant B-cells use anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody acceptable safety profile , particularly patient low-grade B-cell lymphoma low disease burden . To determine whether treatment GA101 result well outcomes see rituximab determine anti-CD20 antibody utilize future study , conduct randomize Phase II trial rituximab GA101 patient previously untreated low-grade lymphoma . Patients receive either rituximab GA101 weekly 4 week follow re-staging . The endpoint study Complete Response ( CR ) , Overall Response Rate ( ORR ) , time next treatment , progression free survival ( PFS ) , safety treatment arm . PrE0401 Sub-Study Evaluation Corrected QT ( QTc ) Interval Pharmacokinetic Parameters Patients Participating GA101 ( Obinutuzumab ) Patients randomize GA101 consent sub-study electrocardiogram obtain pre post Week 1 Week 4 investigate effect GA101 QTc interval . Pharmacokinetic blood sample also do evaluate serum concentration GA101 time-points .</detailed_description>
