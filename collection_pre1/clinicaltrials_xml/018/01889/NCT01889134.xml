	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether osteoprotegerin RANKL ( receptor activator nuclear factor-κB ligand ) involve bone remodel patient primary hyperparathyroidism ( PHPT ) , whether alendronate may useful treatment patient PHPT treat parathyroidectomy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study background rationale Receptor activator nuclear factor-κB ( RANK ) , RANK ligand ( RANKL ) decoy receptor osteoprotegerin ( OPG ) play key role regulate bone turnover . They involve mechanism `` crosstalk '' osteoblast osteoclast . After bind RANK , RANKL induce bone loss , whereas OPG prevents RANKL-RANK interaction increase bone mass strength . The expression RANKL find surface many cell type include cell osteoblast lineage , osteocytes , activate T cell vascular endothelial cell . RANK cell bound receptor RANKL . Its expression detect mainly cell macrophage/monocytic lineage , include pre-osteoclastic cell . OPG produce secrete many different cell type include osteoblast vascular cell . The OPG/RANKL/RANK system regulate many hormone cytokine among parathormone ( PTH ) one important . Primary hyperparathyroidism ( PHPT ) characterize sustain secretion PTH parathyroid glands excessively disproportionate calcium level . This lead enhance bone turnover , predominantly resorption , result low bone mass , hypercalcemia , hypercalciuria hypophosphatemia . Successful parathyroidectomy ( PTX ) reverse pathological condition treatment choice PHPT . Alternatively , bone disease PHPT may treat pharmacologically use bisphosphonates able diminish bone turnover . The mechanism PTH exert effect bone mechanism bone loss PHPT humans fully explain . PHPT enhance PTH seem suitable model observe possible relationship PTH , OPG RANKL . Study objectives The primary objective study investigate serum Osteoprotegerin/sRANKL ( soluble RANKL ) ratio patient primary hyperparathyroidism treat parathyroidectomy alendronate Secondary objective : - To compare effect parathyroidectomy treatment alendronate bone mineral density ( BMD ) ; - To compare effect parathyroidectomy treatment alendronate PTH serum concentration biochemical index PHPT . Subjects control group The subject ( least 50 ) recruit among patient diagnose primary hyperparathyroidism hospitalize Department Endocrinology Wroclaw Medical University . Before include research thoroughly investigate term symptom PHPT disease , particular hormonal disorder , liver kidney function hospitalization . Patients symptomatic disease meet surgery criterion propose undergo selective PTX . Surgery criterion generally follow : serum calcium concentration &gt; 1.0 mg/dL upper limit normal , creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min , BMD &gt; 2.5 standard deviation standard reference value sex-matched peak bone mass site ( T-score &lt; -2.5 ) , age &lt; 50 year old . Patients underwent previously unsuccessful parathyroidectomy , meet criterion surgery unsuitable unwilling undergo PTX treat alendronate . The control group consist generally healthy volunteer ( least 50 ) corresponding age , gender , body mass index ( BMI ) patient PHPT . They suffer bone disease use medication could affect BMD PTH calcium level . Healthy people use control many examine parameter standard concentration serum establish . All subject sign inform consent form enter study . Subjects right withdraw study time reason without prejudice future medical care physician institution . Study protocol Patients diagnosed primary hyperparathyroidism destine PTX ( ) treatment alendronate ( Sedron 70 mg week take orally ) one year . From PTX group patient successful parathyroidectomy followed-up next 12 month study . All subject least 4 visit : month 3 , 6 12 treatment alendronate PTX . BMD lumbar spine ( LS ) , femoral neck ( FN ) , distal third ( F-D ) ultradistal ( F-UD ) sit forearm , total body ( T ) measure dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) every six month . Fasting blood sample well 24-h urine specimens take 3 , 6 12 month study . In control group blood , urine BMD examination PHPT group carry . Serum urinary solute ( calcium , phosphate , creatinine ) PTH alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) assay fresh sample . Additionally serum sample preserve −70°C hormone cytokine estimation . The laboratory evaluation include , limited : - 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D ( 1,25 ( OH ) 2D ) - 25-hydroxyvitamin D ( 25 ( OH ) D ) - Alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) - Calcium - Creatinine - C-terminal telopeptide type I collagen ( ICTP ) - Interleukin -18 - Interleukin-1 beta - Interleukin-6 - Osteocalcin ( OC ) - Osteoprotegerin ( OPG ) - Parathormone ( PTH ) - Phosphate - Soluble RANKL ( receptor activator nuclear factor-κB ligand ) - Total protein - Transforming growth factor-beta ( TGF-β ) - Tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-α ) The accuracy completeness data verify compare register data medical record paper case report form . Safety assessment Safety assessment base : - clinical adverse event report subject observed Investigator , include physical examination study visit ; - abdominal ultrasound examination every six month ; - laboratory evaluation serum calcium , phosphate , creatinine every visit ; - serum pregnancy test , applicable , do every visit ; - regular telephone contact study staff . Treatment compliance If patient miss Sedron administration , take drug next day morning next dose one week . Statistical analysis The data analyze use Statistica 10 ( StatSoft Inc. ) . Categorical data present absolute relative frequency ( n % ) . Continuous data summarize mean , median , standard deviation , minimum maximum . The pairwise deletion use miss data . The statistical significance difference pair data calculate use Wilcoxon 's signed rank test . The Mann-Whitney U test use compare value different sample group . Correlation coefficient determine use Spearman 's rank correlation . The result present mean ± standard deviation . Statistical significance define p &lt; 0.05</detailed_description>
