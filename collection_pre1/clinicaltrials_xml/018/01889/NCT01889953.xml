	<brief_title>EUS-Guided Biliary Drainage Patients With Inoperable Malignant Distal Biliary Obstruction Failed ERCP : Prospective Feasibility Multicenter Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our central hypothesis EGBD equally effective safe percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage ( PTBD ) associate good quality life PTBD patient inoperable malignant distal biliary obstruction fail prior ERCP . Furthermore , EGBD may associate decreased procedure-related cost . Patients undergo PTBD usually require multiple procedure stent exchange/upsize . Our initial study prospective multicenter feasibility study include patient inoperable distal biliary obstruction fail ERCP . If feasibility demonstrate , goal compare EGBD PTBD randomize multicenter international trial crossover design .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Consecutive adult patient ( 1880 year age ) jaundice due inoperable ( EUS and/or CT criterion due health status ) malignant distal ( 2cm distal hilum ) biliary obstruction fail prior ERCP attempt . Failure consider 2 unsuccessful attempt , accord institution 's definition `` fail '' procedure ( patient may consent EGBD prior repeat ERCP due high likelihood failure ) . One failure outside institution one failure institution consider total two failure .
