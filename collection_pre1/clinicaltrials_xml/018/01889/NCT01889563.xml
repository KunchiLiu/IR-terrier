	<brief_title>Physical Training Heart Rate Variability COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective randomized control trial . A total fifty two patient recruit , however , 32 patient meet inclusion criterion . Patients include present : 1 ) diagnosis COPD accord criterion set forth Global Initiative Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease ( 19 ) , 2 ) compliance medical management , 3 ) change medical management decompensation episode least one month prior study initiation , 4 ) participation regular physical exercise program least six month prior study initiation . Exclusion criterion consist presence orthopedic neurological condition would preclude participation physical exercise program , history cardiac arrhythmia , past history consistent heart disease , diabetes mellitus , arterial hypertension failure comply research protocol . Patients randomly assign physical exercise training program PTG , ( n=17 ) control group ( CG , n=15 ) without aerobic exercise training draw shuffle , opaque , cod envelope open immediately start case . However , randomization process , five patient refuse continue seven interested patient exclude . Finally group compose PTG ( n=10 ) control group ( CG , n=10 ) . Heart rate variability ( HRV ) rest submaximal test determine linear analysis ( rMSSD SDNN ) nonlinear index SD1 , SD2 sample entropy ( SE ) . In addition , physiological response obtain cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPX ) , walk distance ( WD ) six minute walk test submaximal constant speed testing ( CST ) . PTP consist 30 minute aerobic exercise training treadmill , 3 time per week 70 % CPX peak speed rate . Patients evaluated baseline , 6 12 week . All patient receive regular treatment consist inhaled bronchodilator steroid dosage change study . The study protocol approve Institutional Ethics Committee patient sign write consent form prior study initiation ( 109/2006 ) . The target number patient calculate 10 patient group , base 5 % type I error , 2-sided test , 80 % power detect change group 5 SD2 rest . Considering drop 20 % , 12 patient group calculate . Due Gaussian distribution and/or homogeneity variance variable value , parametric test select statistical analysis .</detailed_description>
