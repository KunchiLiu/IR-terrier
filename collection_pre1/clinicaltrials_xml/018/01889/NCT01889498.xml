	<brief_summary>The aorta large vessel carry blood away heart . Sometimes becomes dilated ( swell ) know 'aneurysm ' . It may cause either dissection ( split wall ) rupture ( burst ) . Treatments could open surgery use stent ( tubular mesh ) groin . There risk cause paraplegia , loss/weakness leg function well incontinence ( loss bladder and/or bowel control ) . To try prevent , number technique use removing/draining cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) ( clear fluid surround brain spinal cord ) . Sometimes however ; - CSF drain - drain inserted - draining unlikely improve situation - Paralysis/weakness leg see In situation , use drug call acetazolamide may helpful . This reduce production CSF therefore decrease need CSF drain . It may also effect decrease risk paraplegia . Patients randomly ( chance ) place one two group . One get drug tablet injection receive acetazolamide . Blood test do group . We expect 100 patient study , patient involvement total 10 day ( maximum ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aortic aneurysm classify accord extent position aorta involve : thoracic aneurysm ( TA ) , include ascend descend aorta within thoracic cavity , thoracic-abdominal aneurysm ( TAA ) , involve thoracic abdominal aorta , abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA , involve abdominal aorta ) . The outlook patient extensive aneurysms poor treat medically 5 year survival 20 % 1 . Intervention show significantly improve survival great 70 % 5 year 2 . However , intervention come significant risk , mortality 3 40 % paraplegia 5-20 % dependent series1-2 . Additional risk renal pulmonary failure require prolong intensive care unit stay . However , paraplegia remain concern doctor patient . Paraplegia consequence tenuous nature spinal cord blood supply originate aorta . Interruption blood supply aortic repair responsible neurological dysfunction . Several adjunct develop reduce risk include sequential clamping , left-heart bypass , evoked potential , intercostal reattachment cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) drainage- employed Liverpool Heart &amp; Chest Hospital . Drainage spinal fluid reduce intracranial CSF pressure favour blood perfusion spine . In order perform CSF drainage spinal drain inserted patient preoperatively . This process tightly regulate exist `` Spinal Drainage Protocol '' produce Trust . Issues arise follow scenario : 1 . A CSF drain insert technical reason 2 . The CSF blood stain preclude use 3 . Drainage per hour outside protocol guideline ( &gt; 20mls/hr ) 4 . Intracranial Pressure ( ICP ) remain high despite drainage 5 . There neurological impairment ( detection ; clinical Motor Evoked Potentials ) despite adhere protocol . A hypothesis develop team drug call acetazolamide may use scenario encounter . Acetazolamide ( carbonic anhydrase inhibitor ) conventional diuretic also drug use traveller counteract mountain sickness one effect reduce CSF production . A low-dose ( 250mg orally ) drug show effective prophylaxis method acute mountain sickness 3 . Its oral form also utilised reduce shunt CSF volume children4 . Additionally , Acetazolamide suggest 'first-line treatment ' Idiopathic intracranial hypertension 9 , 10 . To date , use drug intravenously 7 thoracic-abdominal patient , licence , encourage result ( SEE APPENDIX 1 ) reduction intracranial pressure ( ICP ) patient . At moment however , drug licence ( approve Medicines Healthcare product Regulatory Agency ( MHRA ) ) use glaucoma , epileptic patient patient abnormal fluid retention . We hypothesize use acetazolamide post operatively , 5 scenario describe , result reduction CSF production hence ICP . Following believe reduce need vasopressor improve spinal cord blood perfusion . Undoubtedly patient drug dramatic effect CSF production , ICP need drainage vasopressor , potential beneficial consequence . We know however whether drug work patient whether consequence effect drug acidosis , hypercapnia diuresis . In addition , know whether drug best give preoperatively , prophylactic measure , whether preoperative treatment improve response intravenous postoperative dose . In addition , know whether measure intuitively low risk paraplegia , actually translate lowering complication . General hypothesis : Acetazolamide may safely use preoperative prophylactic measure ( orally ) , well postoperatively ( intravenous ) treatment measure spinal drain protocol exceed , modify CSF production reduce risk neurological impairment measure biochemically , spectroscopically , electrically clinically . This study power test statistical effect clinically evident paraplegia frequency institution 5 % thus current activity 30 case per year TAA .. ? ? â€¦ case thoracic stents. , study would need run 5 year . The number sufficient demonstrate significant change relatively common end-points note . This study therefore serve prove utility acetazolamide modify factor consider influential development paraplegia . Should study prove positive aim roll international multicentre study test clinical effectiveness reduce paraplegia . Hypothesis Acetazolamide reduce follow clinically relevant end-points : 1 . Intracranial pressure record immediately line insertion , throughout surgery post-operatively ( recording post-operatively treat end-point ) 2 . Need drain large quantity CSF 3 . Incidence non-clinically evident paraplegia ( measure motor evoke potential ) 4 . Incidence clinically evident paraplegia 5 . The need vasopressor drug 6 . Incidence non-clinically evident neurological dysfunction ( measure microwave technology ) 7 . Incidence non-clinically evident neurological dysfunction ( measure CSF/serum biomarkers ) Research Objective : The randomised trial aim investigate inhibitory property drug decrease CSF production reduce ICP , would effect decline paraplegia risk induce elevated ICP . Study design : A single-centre , randomize , unblinded , controlled trial compare acetazolamide versus usual practice Sample size : n=100 ( 50 patient per group ) Power calculation estimate follow : 1 . For reduction 50 % control group treatment group ; We require 32 patient group significant difference 5 % ( P &lt; 0.05 ) We require 54 patient group significant difference 1 % ( P &lt; 0.01 ) 2 . For reduction 25 % control group treatment group ; We require 116 patient group significant difference 5 % ( P &lt; 0.05 ) . We require 192 patient group significant difference 1 % ( P &lt; 0.01 We choose recruit total 100 patient sample size due limitation availability sufficient number patient undergo type surgery single centre .</detailed_description>
