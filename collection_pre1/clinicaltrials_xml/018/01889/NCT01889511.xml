	<brief_summary>The purpose Academic Research Enhancement Award proposal conduct small-scale health-related research project text message improve adherence oral chemotherapy agent . Michigan State University College Nursing major recipient National Institute Health grant funding . As result , overall objective proposal strengthen research environment College Nursing develop significant health-related scientific research enterprise . This project would involve undergraduate graduate student , thus , generate student interest research career . The importance research plan proposal follow . More 50 oral chemotherapy agent pill form currently market , projection 3 year , 25 % cancer treatment deliver pill form . For oral agent achieve therapeutically effective level cancer treatment , patient must strictly adhere regimen . Adherence oral cancer agent often less 80 % , may inadequate treat cancer . To date , empirical research area improve adherence oral agent underdeveloped . The goal research improve adherence oral chemotherapy agent technology base strategy , tailor SMS text message . This prospective randomized control trial examine feasibility , acceptability , satisfaction 3-week tailor text message intervention oral agent adherence . Descriptive statistic , generalize linear modeling , generalize estimate equation use analysis . In proposal , preliminary data collect examine efficacy text message intervention promote adherence oral agent . Data use inform development intervention improve adherence oral agent R01 application conduct large randomize trial test innovative intervention . This study transformative impact oral agent adherence develop technology-based strategy promote adherence among increase number cancer patient receive cancer treatment pill form . This type novel intervention also potential transform impact many ill population require adherence medication regimen .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The therapeutic outcome cancer treatment patient take oral chemotherapy agent depend heavily adherence oral agent regimen . Yet recent research indicate patient miss one-third oral chemotherapy agent dos . With 50 oral anti-cancer agent market , project within 3 year , 25 % cancer treatment deliver pill form . In new treatment paradigm , care move clinic home setting . This mean patient see less frequently oncologists great responsibility place patient . Complicating , 75 % cancer also comorbid condition require perform self-care management ( SCM ) responsibility . In addition , many low self-efficacy , may interfere ability adhere oral agent . The therapeutic outcome patient take oral agent depend heavily engaging patient adhere regimen . Thus , critical need exist test novel intervention promote adherence patient take oral chemotherapy agent . The long-term goal research develop novel intervention improve bio-behavioral outcome patient cancer treatment pill form . The objective study determine feasibility , acceptability , satisfaction efficacy short message service ( SMS ) text message intervention promote adherence among cancer patient prescribed oral agent . The strategy achieve objective examine technology use improve adherence explore translation technology clinical set deploy follow research plan . This 10-week , 2-group , prospective randomize control trial enroll 75 patient ( 50 intervention group 25 control group ) , 2 cancer center , test feasibility efficacy tailor intervention use text message deliver patient 's cell phone promote oral agent adherence . As patient newly prescribe oral agent , randomly assign either intervention control group . At baseline ( week 1 ) , assess age , sex , race , cancer type stage , self-efficacy , comorbid condition SCM , symptom . For 21 day ( week 2-4 ) intervention group receive tailor text message oral agent adherence plus usual care control group receive usual care . Each week ( week 2-9 ) exit ( week 10 ) assessment oral agent adherence symptom occur . Satisfaction intervention also evaluate exit interview . Specific Aims Aim # 1 . To determine feasibility , define patient acceptance , retention study , satisfaction , tailor text message intervention among patient oral agent . Hypotheses test : Hypothesis 1a : 80 % participant recruit enroll study . Hypothesis 1b : 80 % patient intervention group complete 21 day tailor text message . Hypothesis 1c : 90 % intervention group satisfy tailor text message . Aim # 2 . To determine preliminary efficacy tailor text message intervention adherence oral agent . Hypotheses test : Hypothesis 2a : The intervention group significantly high rate oral agent adherence control group . Hypothesis 2b : There large effect size intervention group differences adherence rate . Exploratory aim : To explore effect oral agent complexity , low self-efficacy , symptom severity , comorbid condition , SCM comorbid condition adherence oral agent . We expect adherence great patient higher self-efficacy , simple oral agent , few comorbid condition , few SCM responsibility comorbid condition , low symptom severity . This study transformative impact oral agent adherence develop easy-to-use , technology-based intervention promote adherence among increase number cancer patient receive treatment manner . The significance study target difficult clinical problem among patient sick life threaten disease must adhere complex treatment protocol . This innovative intervention involve readily available technology use interact patient regular , consistent basis would otherwise possible , feasible , cost effective do one-by-one interaction health care provider . The number cancer patient receive chemotherapy pill form increase intervention enable adhere complete cancer treatment . Thus , intervention high generalizability potential transform care .</detailed_description>
