	<brief_title>Idarubicin Overcomes MDR1 Induced Chemoresistance With Higher Induction Remission Rate Quality Than Daunorubicin Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The long-term survival rate acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) significantly prolong due improvement chemotherapeutic protocol hemopoietic stem cell transplantation . However , 20 % -40 % patient refractory AML fail achieve complete remission ( CR ) approximately 50 % CR patient relapse eventually . 1-3 The refractoried relapsed AML patient poor prognosis , therefore refractoriness relapse major challenge chemotherapy AML . Chemoresistance one major obstacle success AML treatment.4 One main mediator AML chemoresistance multi-drug resistance-1 ( MDR1 ) gene MDR1 protein , also know permeability-glycoprotein P-gp.5,6,7 Studies leukemic blast cell demonstrate association MDR1 expression low intracellular retention cytostatic drug lead cancer cell resistance several commonly use anti-cancer drug chemotherapy . Several subsequent study indicate influence MDR1 expression level treatment response survival leukemia patient , frequency resistance chemotherapy increase increase MDR1 expression.8,9,10 Previous method determination MDR1 expression include demonstration P-glycoprotein flow cytometry and/or immunohistochemistry , molecular polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) -based assay RNA expression . However , assay either proven difficult standardize tedious perform mainly focus qualitative semi-quantitative assay . 11,12 A real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR increase sensitivity also maintain high specificity . The false positivity cause pollution amplification production also decrease hermetization operation . RQ- PCR novel methodology enables sensitive quantitative measurement gene expression . 12We establish RQ-PCR method determination expression MDR1 gene . We perform pilot study small cohort AML patient determine relationship MDR1 expression CR rate AML patient . The data show MDR1 expression find case AML . However , MDR1 expression level vary widely case case . This result indicate RQ-PCR method would provide accurate quantitative measurement detection MDR1 expression level different AML case positive qualitative RT-PCR method . 13,14 The pilot result indicate complete response rate induction therapy compromise expression high level MDR1 . 15 Minimal residual disease ( MRD ) major cause leukemia relapse . It report treatment intensity human leukemia assess expression status MRD gene . However , 50 % acute leukemia , especially AMLs , lack know genetic lesion clonegenic marker suitable MRD monitoring . WT1 gene locate chromosome 11p13 cod zinc-finger transcription factor , identify AML patient . It report detection WT1 level effectively monitor MRD expression status AML.16,17 Therefore , WT1 expression use monitor MRD evaluation remission quality AML patient . By detect WT1 level evaluate efficacy different induction therapy . By employ multiple fluorescence quantitative PCR , several target gene simultaneously quantitatively amplify . Therefore multiple fluorescence quantitative PCR suitable clinical application . This technology provide high accuracy , specificity reproducibility also simplify procedure reduce measurement cost . The recombinant plasmid MDR1 WT1 gene construct methodology multiple fluorescence quantitative PCR also develop group .14 High MDR1 gene expression common feature AML resistance conventional chemotherapeutic regimen.18,19 One strategies overcome MDR increase pharmacal liposolubility elevate intracellular drug concentration , counteract drug efflux pump P-glycoprotein . Idarubicin ( IDA ) , new anthracycline , strengthen liposolubility easily permeate cell membrane comparison traditional marcellomycin . Also , vivo metabolite IDA ( 4-IDA ) antineoplastic activity IDA long half-life vivo . It also permeate blood brain barrier . As result , IDA strong antileukemia activity marcellomycin partially overcome P-glycoprotein-mediated drug resistance.20 , 21 In recently pilot study , detect expression MDR1 pre-treated bone marrow sample 160 de novo AML patient median value MDR1/GAPDH ratio de novo AML case 0.016（0-81.865） . The median value MDR1 gene expression take cut-off point high low MDR1 gene expression level . For high MDR1 expression patient , low CR rate ( 61.3 % ) observe compare low-MDR1 expression patient ( 80.0 % , P =0.009 ) . In retrospective pilot study , 123 patient receive daunorubicin ( DNR 35~45mg/m2/d,3 day ) idarubicin ( IDA 6~8 mg/m2/d , 3 day ) combination cytarabine ( Ara-c100~200 mg/m2/d , 7 day ) remission induction significant difference also observe 2 course chemotherapy receive IA regimen ( 57 case ) DA regimen ( 66 case ) regard CR rate ( 80.7 % vs 57.6 % , P=0.006 ) . Significant difference could also discover two treatment arm regard CR rate ( 75.9 % vs 43.6 % , P=0.011 ) high MDR1 expression AML patient . Our data show IDA may overcome MDR1 induce chemoresistance high CR rate DNR de novo high MDR1 expresser AML patients.These result provide rationale development randomize , prospective trial compare CR rate IA regimen DA regimen de novo AML patient high MDR1 expression identify whether Idarubicin overcome MDR1 induce chemoresistance high induction remission rate daunorubicin de novo acute myeloid leukemia patient . We speculate favorable outcome high-MDR1 patient group IA regimen may associate high remission rate . It report AML patient achieve low MRD level extremely low relapse rate . It also report patient treated IA regimen significant high long-term survival DA regimen .22-24 Therefore , speculate favorable outcome IA group may associate low MRD level high remission quality . This study also conduct prospective analysis alteration WT1 MDR1 gene expression level induction therapy IA DA separately identify whether induction therapy IA regimen low MRD level high remission quality DA regimen .</detailed_description>
