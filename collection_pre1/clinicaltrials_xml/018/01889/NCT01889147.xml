	<brief_summary>In present study human recombinant placental alkaline phosphatase ( hRESCAP ) investigate . Alkaline Phosphatase naturally present body report use lipopolysaccharde ( LPS , bacterial endotoxin ) extracellular nucleotide leak damage ischemic cell physiological substrate . The LPS-substrate prevalence make alkaline phosphatase interest novel therapeutic agent treatment LPS-mediated disease . A bovine homologue protein ( bovine intestinal alkaline phosphatase , BIAP ) previously investigate treatment acute inflammatory response sepsis , show safe human . hRESCAP , investigate current study , expect longer half-life human previously investigate BIAP , due fact sialylated . The possibility increase t1/2 day instead minute enable treatment chronic disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Microdose First-In-Human ( FIH ) Study Recombinant Human Placental Alkaline Phosphatase ( hRESCAP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In current study peak plasma concentration ( pharmacokinetics/elimination ) [ 14C ] -labelled hRESCAP healthy volunteer investigate increase single dos ( anticipate therapeutic dose ) , microdose ( ≤30 nmol ) safe start dose . - Part 1 : To assess peak plasma concentration single microdose ( ≤30 nmol ) recombinant human protein ( hRESCAP ) , administer intravenously , suitable technique predict pharmacokinetics human pharmacologically relevant dos ; - Part 2 : To determine safety tolerability single dose hRESCAP 5300 µg healthy male volunteer administer intravenously ; - To determine peak plasma concentration hRESCAP healthy male volunteer within pharmacologically relevant dose-range compare BIAP pharmacokinetics emphasis half-life ( t1/2 ) .</detailed_description>
