	<brief_summary>Treatment pollen allergy roughly divide symptomatic treatment ( e.g . antihistamine , steroid ) potentially curative immunotherapy . Immunotherapy deliver use subcutaneous oral ( mucosal ) rout , similar clinical outcome . The study seek compare immunological change subcutaneous ( SCIT ) sublingual tablet ( AIT ) immunotherapy grass pollen allergy ( hayfever ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immunological Comparison AIT SCIT Immunotherapy Against Grass Pollen</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Worldwide , 400 million people allergic rhinitis , sick-leave due condition cost society billion dollar annually1 . Allergic rhinitis commonly treat oral antihistamine intranasal corticosteroids2 . For moderate-severe rhinitis poor control topical treatment , immunotherapy considered3 . Allergen immunotherapy disease-modifying treatment available IgE mediate allergy . Immunotherapy commonly administer subcutaneous injection SQ-standardized allergen extract ( SCIT ) lesser extent , sublingual drop ( SLIT ) . However , option exist newly develop sublingual allergen immunotherapy tablet ( AIT ) . The clinical effect AIT4 SCIT5 grass pollen allergy demonstrate large double-blind-placebo-controlled registration trial . These study report significant reduction symptom score ( AIT 30 % , SCIT 32 % ) seasonal rescue medication score ( AIT 38 % , SCIT 41 % ) compare placebo4,5 , persist several year withdrawal4,6 . Immunotherapy may prevent new sensitization progression rhinitis asthma7-11 . Allergen immunotherapy generally well tolerated side effect , although potential risk anaphylactic reaction exist 12 . A review recent parallel meta-analyses immunotherapy grass pollen rhinitis suggest safety profile AIT superior SCIT13 . The recommended length immunotherapy SCIT AIT 3-5 years2 , although route administration dose allergen differ substantially . SCIT involve up-dosing phase last 12-15 week one weekly injection increase dos allergen follow maintenance dose every 6-10 week . AIT start daily maintenance dose , result high cumulative dos . It largely unknown whether immunological mechanism involve clinical effect . The change immunology extensively investigate SCIT , pronounce pattern : 1 ) induction block antibody , 2 ) shift Th1/Th2 balance towards Th1 , 3 ) induction regulatory T cell . Similar mechanism seem play AIT 14-16 . Increases allergen-specific non-IgE antibody demonstrate large trial SCIT AIT treatment17,18 , study demonstrate serum antibody reduce vitro reaction mimic allergic response , IgE bind allergen , IgE facilitate antigen presentation basophil activation19-22 , suggest humoral cellular effect play role23 . The aim present study compare effect AIT SCIT antibody titer ( IgE IgG4 ) , allergen-IgE interaction competition assay ( IgE-blocking factor FAP inhibition ) effector cell activation ( BAT ) . Nasal challenge include ass change nasal response grass pollen allergen .</detailed_description>
