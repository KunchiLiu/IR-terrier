	<brief_title>Biphasic Insulin Aspart Versus NPH Plus Regular Human Insulin Type 2 Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design participant This randomize control clinical trial 48 week subject T2DM July 2011 October 2012 . Two hundred four diabetic subject age 28-65 year include study . Subjects A1C &gt; 8.0 % indication start insulin . They randomly allocate two group use simple randomization method . Any current prior medication acceptable inclusion participant except type insulin evaluate . Demographic anthropometric variable record . Hypoglycemia event laboratory data include FPG , HbA1c lipid profile measure every three month . In addition , quality life assess self-administered standard EQ-5D questionnaire ( Brooks , Rabin et al . 2003 ) . Subjects exclude follow criterion : Alteration insulin sensitivity major surgery , infection , renal failure ( Glomerular Filtration Rate &lt; 50 ) , glucocorticoid treatment , recent ( within 2 week ) serious hypoglycemic episode ( require assistance another ) , simultaneous participate another clinical study , use type insulin , sight hearing impaired , active proliferative retinopathy maculopathy require treatment within 6 month prior screen , breast feeding , pregnancy nursing intention become pregnant use adequate contraceptive measure . The study approve ethic committee Tehran University Medical Sciences record IRCT ( IRCT code : 201112038282N1 ) . All eligible subject agree sign write informed consent full explanation purpose nature procedure use . All patient free withdraw time . Assessments outcome measure The insulin therapy prescribe single physician clinic . The start dose BIAsp 30 ( NovoMix® 30-pen , NovoNordisk ) 0.2-0.6 unit/kg per day 2 divide dos accord level glycemia intervention group . The control group receive NPH/Reg insulin ( Exir pharmaceutical , Lorestan , Iran ) Ratio 2:1 initiation dose 0.2-0.6 unit/kg 2 divided dos . Two-thirds dose give breakfast remainder dinner NPH/Reg insulin group . Changes oral glucose lower drug ( OGLDs ) time start insulin analog , thereafter , entirely discretion participant physician . Para clinical data measure referral laboratory every three month . After overnight fast least 12 hour , blood sample obtain measurement fast blood sugar ( FBS ) use glucose oxidase method , lipid profileswere determine use enzymatic method . These measurement conduct use commercial Parsazmun kit ( Tehran , Iran ) Hitachi 704 automatic analyzer ( Tokyo , Japan ) ( Lentjes , Harff et al . 1987 ) . HbA1c measure use high performance liquid chromatography method ( Esteghamati , Jamali et al . 2010 ) . Post prandial blood glucose ( PPG ) measure two hour breakfast use glucose analyzer ( YSI 2700 Select , YSI , Inc. , Yellow Springs , OH ) . Trial visit define 0 , 12 , 24 , 36 48 week baseline . All participant ask record 7-point blood glucose value three consecutive day visit . Seven-point self-monitoring blood glucose include three pre-meals , three post-meals , bedtime blood glucose value day . Insulin dose adjust titration regimen accord self-monitored blood glucose . For group , treatment goal follow : fasting blood glucose 80-120 mg/dl , postprandial glucose &lt; 160 mg/dl , A1C &lt; 7 % dinner blood glucose target NPH/Reg insulin group 100 mg/dl , stepwise increase type insulin depend pre-meal blood glucose value achieve target plasma glucose ( PG ) follow : +2 IU/day 126 mg/dl &lt; PG &lt; 140 mg/dl , +4 IU/day 140 mg/dl &lt; PG &lt; 160 mg/dl , +6 IU/day 160 mg/dl &lt; PG &lt; 180 mg/dl , +8 IU/day 180 mg/dl &lt; PG &lt; 200 mg/dl +10 IU/day PG &gt; 200 mg/dl ( Hermansen , Davies et al . 2006 ; Liebl , Prager et al . 2009 ) , unless symptom hypoglycemia occur . Hypoglycemia define blood glucose &lt; 70 mg/dl . Severe hypoglycemia define event symptom consistent hypoglycemia individual require assistance another person treat oral carbohydrate due confusion unconsciousness associate blood glucose level &lt; 40 mg/dl recovery intravenous glucose , glucagon administration . Nocturnal hypoglycemia define hypoglycemia occur night commonly know hypoglycemia asleep . Data collect physician 's clinical note participant ' recall self-monitoring blood glucose value visit . Costs Direct medical cost : We collect medical cost patient checklist . All patient ask refer clinic every one month study . Clinical event hospital episode also related cost determine visit . Any pharmaceutical , laboratory/diagnostic rehabilitative care , well contact specialist , general practitioner , nurse , optician , dietician record patient with/without complication . Finally total cost calculate . Direct nonmedical cost Any service transportation patient family clinic take care dependent assess non-medical expenditure patient self-estimate questionnaire . Indirect cost The lost productivity cost due health problem DM determine day absent work , poor work performance , low earnings capacity disability , mortality . We calculate number day visit patient could present job DM relate health care . The average net hourly wage ask patient . For unemployed patient , consider average wage population economically active employment ( Javanbakht , Baradaran et al . 2011 ) . Lost earnings owe premature mortality define mortality cost . Costs health provider perspective , convert Iranian Rials ( IRR ) USA dollar ( USD ) official exchange rate 12,260 IRR/1USD 2012 international comparison ( Central Bank Iran ) . Utility calculation Utility score calculate two recent well know measurement ; EQ-5D EQ-VAS 0-1.These two standardized measure health status quality adjust life year ( QALY ) , develop EuroQol group order provide simple , generic measure health clinical economic appraisal ( 1990 ) . Cost Effectiveness Analysis Hypoglycemic event QALYs consider outcome incremental cost effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) per patient calculate accord formula : ICER= ∆Cost/ ∆Outcome ( Rasccati Karen L. 2009 ) .The comparison ICERs hold afterwards per outcome . Analysis All data present mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) . Significant difference general characteristic determine Chi-square Student 's t-test . Change baseline HbA1c , FBS , PPBG , blood lipid analyze use analysis variance ( ANOVA ) model baseline characteristic variate . SPSS Windows ( Version 14 ; SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL ) use data analysis P value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
