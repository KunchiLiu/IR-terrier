	<brief_summary>Around 0.5 million under-five child currently suffer severe acute malnutrition ( SAM ) Bangladesh risk death . Children SAM complication treat health care facility . It imperative , however , manage child SAM without complication community . This require ready-to-use-therapeutic food ( RUTF ) conform standard recommendation composition . The prototype RUTF peanut base , make outside Bangladesh , import . By develop RUTF use local food ingredient , test acceptability efficacy treatment child SAM , hopefully make treatment SAM cost-effective sustainable . Hypothesis : Does locally develop ready-to-use-therapeutic food ( RUTFs ) demonstrate similar good acceptability efficacy treatment child suffer severe acute malnutrition ( SAM ) compare prototype RUTF ( Plumpynut ) ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Development Field Testing Ready-to-use-therapeutic Foods Made Local Ingredients Bangladesh SAM Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Childhood malnutrition continue significant public health problem world , especially Asia . Acute malnutrition , severe acute malnutrition ( SAM ) among child five year age remain major embarrassment , impediment optimal human capital development Asia . Without access appropriate treatment , SAM child high risk death ; hospital Bangladesh develop country facility manage child appropriately coverage extremely low . In 2008 , Government Bangladesh publish National Guidelines management SAM facility level . However , national guideline yet become operationalized small exploratory initiative focus community-based management acute malnutrition ( CMAM ) . Under auspex Directorate General Health Services , 2007 national consensus meeting management SAM resolve CMAM along scale facility-based management essential Bangladesh local RUTF develop ensure cost-effective sustainable program . Absence RUTF make locally available food ingredient hence , relatively inexpensive , impede implementation program community-based management SAM country . The propose project develop new improve recipe RUTF base establish principle dietetics select least two candidate RUTFs treat SAM test acceptability efficacy . The experiment development RUTF do ICDDR , B Food Processing Laboratory investigator . Experiments , include assessment composition local food ingredient presence anti-nutrient factor , phytate , perform laboratory Nutriset France . Acceptability candidate RUTFs child well mother assess compare among group child , receive new two RUTF product prototype RUTF ( Plumpy'nut ) . For efficacy trial , study population child come ICDDR , B hospital SAM complication . They receive standardized management acute/initial phase treatment hospital . After completion initial treatment associate medical complication appetite test standard RUTF do . If child pass appetite test , child enrol study subsequent alternate feed child replace assigned RUTF . The child observe next day give total ration assign RUTF monitor possible adverse effect , e.g . skin rash , urticaria food allergy , abdominal distension , pain abdomen , vomit , diarrhea significant change clinical status . If unwanted event child eats RUTF eagerly , child discharge hospital RUTF ration one week ( 7- 10 day ' ration cover weekend holiday ) . The RUTFs use partial double-blind manner . Complete blinding three RUTFs might possible distinctive smell peanut proto type RUTF . Other two candidate RUTFs blind . The code keep producer sachet ( Nutriset ) Dr ASG Faruque , Senior Scientist , ICDDR ' B , involve study . A team ICDDR , B staff responsible implementation study . All field personnel recruit full time study prior experience interview technique , data collection , assessment nutritional status . Before start field activity , intensive 5-day training give supervisor interviewer . The quality control team support investigator ( ) monitor performance field personnel regular observation household level regular check data completeness . The quality control team independently check data collection . Errors detect correct immediately field . The entire assignment include report writing complete within 24 month IRB approval ICDDR , B sign MOU UNICEF , Bangladesh , Nutriset ICDDR , B .</detailed_description>
