	<brief_summary>Cognitive impairment widely report side effect many commonly use drug . Even mild , untoward effect essential function linguistic behavior , directly observable product complex cognitive process , disruptive daily life . Nevertheless , mechanisms underlying drug 's impact cognition poorly understood . This lack understand impedes ability predict effect drug development degree individual vulnerable cognitive impact particular agent . Topiramate ( TPM , antiepileptic drug ) , increase frequency , prescribed range condition include migraine prophylaxis , obesity pain . It prime example drug cause speech language problem severe enough patient result discontinuation therapy . For reason well understood , TPM poorer cognitive profile many old antiepileptic drug . The investigator ' rational study offer insight mechanism underlie drug-induced cognitive deficit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator ' long-term goal enhance clinical strategy inform drug development order maximize benefit individual drug therapy minimize adverse cognitive/language-related side effect . The investigator ' objective application elucidate relationship among drug exposure measure plasma drug level , neurophysiological effect , consequent effect cognitive process observable everyday language use . Using topiramate ( TPM ) prototype , investigator apply tools clinical pharmacology , computational linguistics , neuroscience , engineering design execution randomize , double blind , crossover study use three ( 3 ) dos TPM , one ( 1 ) dose comparator drug ( lorazepam-LZP ) placebo . In order isolate cognitive effect TPM possibly arise underlie medical condition , subject healthy adult . The investigator capitalize innovative system automate language speech analysis ( SALSA ) develop laboratory , quantify effect TPM administration effective language use , crucial component normal day-to-day functioning .</detailed_description>
