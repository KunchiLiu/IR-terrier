	<brief_summary>Nutritional formula drink widely consume Asia especially chronic illness diabetes . Therefore , gauge impact nutritional formula blood glucose level important . Asia home three predominant ethnic groups- Chinese , Malay Indians . It still unknown blood glucose response nutritional formula differs ethnic group . Therefore aim study observe ethnic difference blood glucose response nutritional formula drink .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Determine Ethnic Differences Glycaemic Response Nutritional Formula Drinks</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nutritional formula commonly consume individual supplement food intake total meal replacers . Consumption rate nutritional formula increase also Asia . Very little known difference glycaemic response nutritional formula different ethnic group . The aim current study determine glycaemic response ( GR ) glycaemic index ( GI ) three nutrition formula Chinese , Indian Malay subject . The study randomise , non-blind , between-subjects , crossover design . The subject return six test session . At three random session subject test reference food remain three session consume test food ( Diasip , Isocal , Protinex ) . The first test session glucose test session ( subject require glucose test ) . The reference food anhydrous glucose ( 50 g ) dissolve 250 ml water . The test food portion nutritional formula contain 50 g available carbohydrate . Subjects previously take part GI study CNRC already complete three reference glucose test complete three test food session . However , may ask one , two three glucose test previous test result old ( &gt; 3 month ) within require precision ( CV &lt; 30 % ) . This aspect discretion investigator communicate participant time briefing ( consent ) . The primary measurement study glycaemic response . This measure use finger-prick blood sample . The finger non-dominant hand use . To encourage blood flow hand warm use warm water hot towel beforehand require . The finger disinfect use sterile wipe . Blood obtain finger prick use single-use lancing device . To minimise plasma dilution fingertip squeeze extract blood gently massage start base hand move towards tip . The first two drop express blood discard next drop ( 5 μL ) use test . Blood glucose sample measure use HemoCue® 201+ Glucose analyser ( HemoCue Ltd , Dronfield , UK ) . The participant arrive laboratory 8:30-9 follow 10 hour overnight fast . They instruct partake intense level sport avoid alcohol consumption even prior test session . Following 10 minute rest two blood sample obtain five minute apart determine baseline blood glucose level . If two baseline blood glucose value far apart 1-2 blood sample may take two stable value obtain . The study session terminate stable value obtain baseline blood glucose level 6 mmol/L . After obtain acceptable baseline blood glucose value give either standard test food consume . They ask consume drink comfortable pace within 10 minute . Further blood sample obtain 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 150 180 minute blood glucose measurement . Mandatory sample carry 120 minute . If blood glucose level reach baseline level end 120 minute sample may take 150 180 minute . During entire test period participant instruct remain rested laboratory .</detailed_description>
