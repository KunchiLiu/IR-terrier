	<brief_summary>It show vitro animal model hypoxia pro-inflammatory effect hyperoxia anti-inflammatory effect . The pro-inflammatory effect could result activation Hypoxia Inducible Factor , transcription factor know activate many cell system aim cell survival , include inflammatory response . The anti-inflammatory effect hyperoxia could annihilation Hypoxia Inducible Factor , also decrease inflammation due oxygen toxicity result decrease clearance pathogen . These effect sparsely study human . Therefore , hypothesize hypoxia result increase Hypoxia Inducible Factor circulate leukocyte increase inflammatory reaction , whereas hyperoxia decrease reaction .</brief_summary>
