	<brief_summary>Background : The human face critically important breathing , eat , see , speaking/ communicating , important job may look like human face . Devastating facial deformity often cause affected individual avoid human contact disappear society . Although current surgical advancement somewhat restore facial defect , process often require many operation result face resembles human face . To date , 20 face transplant perform highly encouraging functional aesthetic result , widespread clinical use limit due adverse effect life-long high-dose immunosuppression need prevent graft rejection . Risks include infection , cancer , metabolic problem , greatly affect recipient ' quality life , make procedure risky , jeopardize potential benefit face transplantation . Study Design : This non-randomized , Phase II clinical trial document use new immunomodulatory protocol ( aka - Pittsburgh Protocol , Starzl Protocol ) establish face transplantation safe effective reconstructive treatment devastate injuries/ defect minimize maintenance immunosuppression therapy face transplant patient . This protocol combine lymphocyte depletion donor bone marrow cell infusion enable graft survival use low dos single immunosuppressive drug follow weaning treatment . Initially design living-related solid organ donation , regimen adapt use graft donate deceased donor . The investigator propose perform 15 full partial human face transplant employ novel protocol . Specific Aims : 1 ) To establish face transplantation safe effective reconstructive strategy treatment devastate facial injuries/defects ; 2 ) To reduce risk rejection enable allograft survival minimize requirement long-term , high-dose , multi-drug immunosuppression . Significance Research : Face transplantation could help injured individual recover functionality , self-esteem , ability reintegrate family social life `` whole '' individual . This protocol offer potential minimizing morbidity maintenance immunosuppression , thereby beneficially shift risk/benefit ratio life-enhancing procedure enable wide clinical application face transplantation .</brief_summary>

Strong desire undergo craniomaxillofacial transplantation . Completes protocol informed consent form . Nonsmoker , define never smoke quit &gt; 6 consecutive month prior screen . No coexist medical condition , opinion study team , could affect immunomodulatory protocol , surgical procedure , functional result ( see Exclusion Criteria . If condition amenable treatment , study team must agree say condition significantly enhance surgical risk full partial craniomaxillofacial transplantation . ) No coexist psychosocial problem ( i.e. , alcoholism , drug abuse ) . Negative malignancy past 5 year . Negative HIV transplant . Negative crossmatch donor . If female childbearing potential , negative serum pregnancy test . If female childbearing potential , consent use reliable contraception least one year follow transplantation . Consents cell collection , storage , bone marrow infusion part treatment regime . USA citizen equivalent . Patient agree comply protocol state dedication immunomodulatory treatment regime . Positive following condition : Untreated sepsis . HIV ( active seropositive ) . Active tuberculosis . Active Hepatitis B infection . Hepatitis C. Viral encephalitis . Toxoplasmosis . Malignancy ( within past 5 year ) . Current/recent ( within 3 month donation/screening consent ) IV drug abuse . Paralysis ischemic , traumatic , congenital origin . Infectious , post infectious , inflammatory ( axonal demyelinating ) neuropathy . Toxic neuropathy ( i.e . heavy metal poisoning , drug toxicity , industrial agent exposure ) . Mixed connective tissue disease . Conditions , opinion study team , may impact immunomodulatory protocol potentially expose recipient unacceptable risk immunosuppressive treatment . A history medical noncompliance . Sensitized recipient high level ( 50 % ) panelreactive HLA antibody . Conditions may impact success surgical procedure increase risk postoperative complication include inherited coagulopathies like Hemophilia , VonWillebrand 's disease , Protein C S deficiency , Thrombocythemias , Thallassemias , Sickle Cell disease , etc . Mixed connective tissue disease collagen disease result poor wound heal surgery . Conditions may impact functional outcome include Lipopolysaccharidosis amyloidosis ( may impact nerve regeneration ) rare disorder bone heal like osteopetrosis . Subjects inadequate donor sit autologous reconstruction event posttransplant flap failure . Patients consider unsuitable per consult Psychiatric/ Psychologic appraisal .</criteria>
