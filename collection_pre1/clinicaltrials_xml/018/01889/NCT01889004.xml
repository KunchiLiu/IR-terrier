	<brief_summary>The explanation consciousness pose one greatest challenge science philosophy 21st century . It remain unclear consciousness emerge brain activity . By study anesthesia sleep , investigator aim reveal happens brain consciousness lose return . During study , series Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) , Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) electroencephalography ( EEG ) study carry healthy male subject reveal neural correlate consciousness . Consciousness subject manipulate normal sleep anesthetic agent dexmedetomidine propofol . First , various neurophysiological tool separate consciousness , connectedness responsiveness normal sleep test . The suitable method subject select test anesthetic-induced sedation loss responsiveness ( LOR ) . The anesthetic ( dexmedetomidine propofol ) administer target-controlled infusion ( TCI ) step-wise concentration-increments LOR detect . Then , TCIs repeat subject adjust accord individual drug target concentration sufficient LOR , series PET perfusion image measurement perform obtain brain activity information various state consciousness . The subject image PET brain activity sleep deprivation ( awake ) , various sleep stage immediately awaken . Finally , ten dexmedetomidine subject give drug , functional MRI ( fMRI ) data collect various state consciousness verbal nonverbal vocalization . EEG continuously collect session . The depth anesthesia measure use quantitative EEG bispectral index ( BIS ) monitoring . The result may lead discovery new well objective indicator depth anesthesia consciousness , new insight understanding neural mechanism behind drug-induced loss consciousness ultimately mechanisms action ( general ) anesthetic well consciousness .</brief_summary>
