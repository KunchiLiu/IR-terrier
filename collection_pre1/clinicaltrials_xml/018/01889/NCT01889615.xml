	<brief_summary>The investigator want compare use MRI PET/CT preform 1 hour 3 hour preoperative assessment resectability . The investigator ' hypothesis dual time PET/CT perform 60 180 minute increase diagnostic accuracy conventional PET ( perform 60 minute ) preoperative assessment resectability . Further investigator suggest GLUT/G6Pase index correlate SUVmax . And retention index ( RI , see Methods - PET protocol ) prognostic marker ovarian cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The use PET/CT ovarian cancer well-established . The diagnosis usually include physical examination ( incl . pelvic examination ) , blood test incl . CA-125 transvaginal ultrasound . Furthermore image include CT thorax/abdomen and/or MR pelvic . Ninety per cent ovarian cancer epithelial carcinoma ( EOC ) , divide serous ( 45 % ) , mucinous ( 4 % ) , endometrioid ( 5 % ) , clear cell , undifferentiated mixed type . All EOC treat equally . Treatment ovarian cancer involve surgery chemotherapy . The decision operability make multidisciplinary conference . Prognosis depend stage histological type tumor also end result surgery . Residual disease initial surgery strong prognostic factor survival , improvement overall progression free survival great woman minimal ( tumor &lt; 1 cm ) visible disease end surgery . Supra radical surgery radical procedure plus e.g . extensive peritonectomy , resection liver metastasis , splenectomy , resection tail pancreas bowel resection . Only 60 % patient advanced stage ovarian cancer deem optimal debulked peroperative . Patients optimal debulking 5 year survival 42 % versus patient possible achieve radical operation 5 year survival 15 % , result hazard rate 2,12 optimal vs. optimal debulking . A correct preoperative assessment important planning operation avoid futile operation patient resectable . Preoperative CT show predictive value assessment completeness cytoreduction . But also PET/CT show independent predictor resectability . Currently MR standard evaluate patient operability . Studies show PET/CT particularly useful distinguish patient stag I-IIIB IIIC-IV , accuracy 98 % compare 88 % CT alone . The latter group important identify optimal debulking often possible benefit preoperative chemotherapy . Currently use PET/CT stag ovarian cancer controversial , mainly relatively low specificity , due FDG-uptake inflammatory cell benign lesion . The concordance PET/CT surgical staging ovarian cancer report range 69 % 78 % .8,9 , And recent study find good correlation PET/CT finding laparoscopy high rate false negative result lesion &lt; 5 mm . But dual time point image maybe solution problem . Today standard perform PET/CT scan 60-90 minute injection tracer . Theoretically , get increase tumor/background ratio perform late scan , thus well able distinguish malignant benign . Dual time image study head neck cancer , breast cancer lung cancer suggest improvement diagnostic accuracy PET . But use delay image ovarian cancer study . The tracer use PET 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose . Generally cancer cell think low absent G6Pase expression compare normal cell cancer cell increase expression GLUT ( especially GLUT1 ) hexokinase ( especially HK2 ) , lead intracellular trap FDG-6-phosphate malignant cell yield high maximum standardize uptake value ( SUVmax ) . But ovarian cancer find relatively low ratio hexokinase/phosphatase maybe explain low/absent rise FDG-uptake . The amount GLUT , hexokinase G6Pase responsible FDG trap intracellular retention late scan .</detailed_description>
