	<brief_summary>Background : - Bone marrow stromal cell ( BMSCs ) cell develop tissue type , include bone , cartilage , marrow , blood cell . However , BMSCs stem cell evidence infusion another person BMSCs change cell . Research suggest BMSCs travel different part body work immune cell reduce inflammation help repair damage tissue . BMSC infusion use test treat moderate severe inflammatory bowel disease , like Crohn 's disease ( CD ) ulcerative colitis ( UC ) . These test show good result , research need study safety effectiveness . Researchers want see well BMSC infusion work treat CD UC . The BMSCs collect volunteer donor . Objectives : - To look safety effectiveness BMSC infusion moderate severe CD UC . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 65 year old moderate severe inflammatory bowel disease ( CD UC ) respond standard treatment . Design : - Participants two screen visit . The first 15 30 day first BMSC infusion . The second within 14 day first BMSC infusion . - At first screen visit , participant physical exam medical history . They provide blood , urine , stool sample . They also give information symptom quality life . - At second screen visit , participant vital sign ( like blood pressure heart rate ) measure . They also provide blood sample , colonoscopy biopsy . - During treatment , participant one BMSC infusion per week 4 week . Blood urine sample collect treatment visit . - One week last infusion , participant study visit . The test first second screen visit repeat . - There six follow-up visit 1 , 2 , 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 month last study visit . Participants repeat test first screen visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Crohn disease ( CD ) ulcerative colitis ( UC ) , 2 major sub-types inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) , chronic , life-long condition characterize relapse inflammation gastrointestinal tract . CD predilection small bowel proximal large bowel ; however , affect gastrointestinal tract discontinuously anywhere . UC mainly affect distal colon involve entire colon well . In spite advance IBD therapeutic , significant number patient continue symptoms conventional medication . The current protocol proposes study infusion allogenic bone marrow stromal cell ( BMSCs ) treatment active IBD . The purpose study evaluate safety BMSC infusion subject IBD examine host clinical immunologic response BMSCs . BMSCs possess multi-lineage differentiation potential bone marrow , aid repair damage tissue . They suppress lymphocyte immune response target sit inflammation promote heal tissue regeneration . Studies underway examine utility BMSCs treat several condition include neurologic disorder , myocardial infarction , rheumatologic disorder , gastrointestinal disorder include acute graft-versus-host-disease IBD . Progress understand cell population involve pathogenesis IBD discovery potential immunologic regenerative characteristic BMSCs create new potential direction IBD therapy . This phase I study enroll subject moderate-to-severe IBD refractory intolerant standard therapy . Under guidance NIH Bone Marrow Stromal Cell Transplantation Center , Cell Processing Section Department Transfusion Medicine Clinical Center develop procedure collecting , expand , cryopreserving clinical grade BMSCs FDA Drug Master File . Marrow aspirate volunteer donor participate protocol 10-CC-0053 pass standard screen blood marrow donor ; BMSCs expand vitro . Since necessary HLA-match BMSC donor recipient , BMSC repository use source BMSCs study . In Arm 1 , safety BMSC infusion dosage ( 4 x 106 cells/kg/dose 10 % ) schedule ( week 4 week ) evaluate 3 non-overlapping IBD subject . Once safety establish subject , subsequent subject Arm 2 enrol without overlap restriction . Subjects return clinic safety response assessments 28 , 56 , 84 , 112 day first infusion . Additional safety visit perform 180 , 360 720 day first infusion . Safety monitor Data Safety Monitoring Board . Response study drug assess patient change symptom score , endoscopic/histologic finding , quality life score , immunologic/laboratory parameter . Fifty subject evaluate 5-year period .</detailed_description>

Any subject NOT meet criterion list # 2 , appropriately counsel reproductive risk pregnancy avoidance , require adhere follow measure , agree upon subject PI least 12 week last BMSC infusion : 1 . A highly effective hormonal method prevent pregnancy [ e.g . CONSISTENT , CONTINUOUS use contraceptive pill , patch , ring , implant injection ] , and/or IUD equivalent . IN ADDITION TO 2 . A barrier method use time potentially reproductive sexual activity ( e.g . [ male/female condom , cap , diaphragm ] + spermicide ) . 3 . Male participant appropriately counsel risk must agree consistently use effective contraception female sexual partner Day 112 study visit avoid pregnancy could affect study drug . Appropriate measure avoid pregnancy trial related risk sexual partner , per PI judgment , must agree practiced .
