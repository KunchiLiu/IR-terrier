	<brief_summary>The Bio-SHiFT study aim investigate whether disease progression individual patient chronic heart failure ( CHF ) accurately assess serial measurement disease-related ( novel ) biomarkers . Secondary objective study include comparison 2D- real-time 3D-echocardiography CHF patient comparison Speckle track tissue Doppler imaging ( TDI ) CHF patient , relate echocardiographic measurement clinical outcome . Bio-SHiFT prospective , observational , multi-center , cohort study men woman , age 18 year old , visit outpatient clinic . Blood sample take day inclusion follow-up visit , perform every 3 month end schedule follow-up . Clinical data collect baseline 3-month follow-up visit . Echocardiography include TDI , Speckle track 3D-echocardiography performed subset patient , baseline follow-up 6-month interval . The primary endpoint composite cardiovascular death , cardiac transplantation , leave ventricular assist device implantation , re-hospitalization management acute worsen heart failure .</brief_summary>
