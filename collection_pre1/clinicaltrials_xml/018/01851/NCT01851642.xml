	<brief_summary>The purpose study look Alpha-1-antitrypsin ( AAT ) deficiency Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) affect white blood cell lung , call macrophage , ability work .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lung Disease Its Affect Work White Blood Cells Lungs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AAT deficiency genetic disorder affect around 100,000 people USA , include 1-3 % people diagnose chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . In AAT deficient people diagnose COPD , originally believe cause disease due lack supply alpha-1 antitrypsin . However , early information gather laboratory suggest another cause development COPD progress disease may due malfunction macrophage . CF also genetic disorder affect 1/300 birth among Caucasian population . One main symptom CF inflammation lung tissue . Lung macrophages play major role lung inflammation well help resolve inflammation . Inflammation important defense body . It body 's response infection cause germ thing may cause irritation , well , way body repair damage tissue . We suggest effect AAT deficiency CF decrease inflammation response lung also restrict ability macrophage correct inflammation occurs .</detailed_description>
