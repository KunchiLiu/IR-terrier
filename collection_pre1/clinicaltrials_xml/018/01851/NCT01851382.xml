	<detailed_description>Background : - Chronic graft-versus-host disease ( cGVHD ) severe immunological complication occur allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) . Although oral cGVHD occur &gt; 25 % cGVHD patient lead decrease quality life , etiology poorly understood . - The primary objective present protocol enroll normal volunteer contribute saliva and/or blood sample order compare characteristic patient without chronic GVHD allogeneic HSCT . The normal control saliva blood sample provide standard comparison patient saliva blood sample ongoing NCI cGVHD related protocol . Objective : -To collect approximately 5 ml saliva and/or 18 cc peripheral blood healthy volunteer need support research activity . Eligibility : - Healthy individual ( include employee ) racial/ethnic group , age 18 year old . - Volunteers must willing undergo saliva peripheral blood collection . - No active illness , immunodeficiency , history opportunistic infection , autoimmune disease , immunosuppressive medication prior organ , bone marrow peripheral blood stem cell transplant . - Ability subject understand provide write informed consent . - Phase I study restricted male , age 30-70 year Design : - Healthy volunteer offer opportunity participate protocol . - A basic clinical dental assessment do . - Saliva sample collect consent subject . - Peripheral blood sample may collect consent subject visit . - Protein assay perform collected saliva blood sample .</detailed_description>
