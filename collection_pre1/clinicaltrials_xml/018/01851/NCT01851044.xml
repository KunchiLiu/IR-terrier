	<brief_title>The Effect Platelet Rich Plasma Lateral Epicondylitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lateral epicondylitis , also know `` tennis elbow '' , common work-related disease upper extremity . Usually favorable natural healing-tendency , sometimes responsible long-lasting disability . The pathogenesis disease remain unclear , however speculate role inflammation small previously believe . Instead , anatomical vascular factor may play much great role . The evidence operative treatment lacking , conservative treatment therefore prefer . The conservative treatment use rely largely corticosteroid injection extensor muscle insertion . However , show corticosteroid , fact , tend increase subjective pain long run . Several study -- unfortunately underpowered -- carry find efficient conservative treatment disease , none turn significantly good others . During last couple year , platelet rich plasma ( PRP ) use treatment several musculoskeletal disease ( e.g . fracture healing , cartilage regeneration , wound heal ) . PRP substance centrifuge patient blood . There couple study regard use PRP lateral epicondylitis . The result mostly positive ; however thoroughly show would effective patient 's whole blood . The hypothesis study PRP effective treatment lateral epicondylitis whole blood saline vehicle injection . The primary outcome measure pain ( VAS ) Disabilities Arm , Shoulder Hand -score ( DASH ) .</detailed_description>
