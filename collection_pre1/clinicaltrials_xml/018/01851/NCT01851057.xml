Non-adherence , modifiable , associate continued seizure , mortality , poor quality life , high healthcare cost .

	<brief_title>Supporting Treatment Adherence Regimens Pediatric Epilepsy : The STAR Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-adherence antiepileptic drug ( AEDs ) common ( i.e. , 58 % patient level non-adherence ) previously under-recognized problem young child newly diagnose epilepsy . This surprising give consequence non-adherence patient epilepsy extremely serious , include continued seizure , mortality , high healthcare expenditure . Despite critical need develop implement intervention improve adherence , family-based intervention young child epilepsy family . As , develop family-tailored adherence intervention ( STAR : Supporting Treatment Adherence Regimens ) focus increase epilepsy knowledge problem-solving skill around barrier adherence child epilepsy family . Data pilot adherence intervention study demonstrate good preliminary effect ( effect size= 0.64 ) excellent feasibility , family report intervention beneficial positive experience family . Capitalizing finding , next logical step test efficacy STAR intervention improve AED adherence 200 child epilepsy via randomize controlled trial . Thus , aim study examine short-term long-term effect STAR intervention electronically-monitored medication adherence child new-onset epilepsy compare education ( EO ) intervention . In addition , exploratory aim examine effect STAR intervention seizure freedom QOL child epilepsy compare EO intervention . The current study use innovative , sequential , randomization enrichment design preventatively target 200 patient new-onset epilepsy , 2-12 year , demonstrate non-adherence . Using criterion establish pilot study , adherence fall 95 % within first six month study trigger participant randomization one two 8-session intervention : STAR EO . If aim project achieve , study change practice pediatric epilepsy provide proven approach routine monitoring treatment AED non-adherence epilepsy clinic across nation . This study also lay foundation determine long term impact adherence intervention morbidity mortality . In addition , study 's innovative methodological enrichment design generalizable pediatric condition lead development cost effective , clinic-based adherence promotion intervention .</detailed_description>
