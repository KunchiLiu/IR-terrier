	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) -guided laser surgery ( MLA ) doxorubicin hydrochloride treat patient recurrent glioblastoma multiforme . The blood brain barrier ( BBB ) separation circulate blood tissue central nervous system , prevent substance blood enter brain . MLA disrupt BBB around tumor may allow cancer-killing substance carry directly tumor surround area . Using MLA prior chemotherapy may result great concentration drug tumor kill cancer cell limit side effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Evaluate imaging technique ( MRI ) blood test ( biomarkers ) help figure best time chemotherapy initiate blood brain barrier disrupt , immediately follow procedure like MRI-guided laser ablation ( MLA-Monteris Neuroblate ) .</detailed_description>
