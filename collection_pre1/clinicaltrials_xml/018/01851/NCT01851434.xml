	<brief_summary>Background : - Optic neuritis often symptom multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . Many people experience optic neuritis later diagnose MS. MS disease activity see magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan often great see test give regular doctor 's visit . Even though MRI helpful tool study optic neuritis MS , information need MS symptom show MRI scan . Researchers want use MRI scan track change optic nerve optic neuritis episode . This approach help study relationship optic neuritis MS . Objectives : - To collect information relationship optic neuritis multiple sclerosis . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 50 year age new optic neuritis . - Individuals 18 50 year age new symptom MS optic neuritis . - Healthy volunteer 18 50 year age . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They may provide blood urine sample . - Participants optic neuritis MS symptom baseline study visit . They physical exam full eye exam . To look sign MS , evoke potential test see body responds stimulation . They also MRI scan study change brain optic nerve . - After first visit , participant steroid treatment 5 day optic neuritis . - Additional study visit give 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month baseline visit . The test first visit , include MRI scan , repeat visit . - Healthy volunteer baseline study visit . They physical exam full eye exam . They evoke potential test see body responds stimulation . They also MRI scan study change brain optic nerve . - Healthy volunteer additional study visit 2 11 month baseline visit . The test first visit , include MRI scan , repeat visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective The goal pilot study : 1 . To assess degree subacute change clinical , electrophysiological , image measure robustly predict retinal neuronal loss 12 month acute optic neuritis . 2 . To construct composite score integrates subacute change , robustly predict retinal neuronal loss 12 month acute optic neuritis , validated future trial , likely modulate drug promote tissue repair neuroprotection multiple sclerosis ( MS ) . 3 . To evaluate usefulness specialize magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) measure optic nerve future clinical trial drug design promote tissue repair neuroprotection . The primary hypothesis study peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer ( RNFL ) thickness , generally agree reflect integrity optic nerve axon follow optic neuritis , measure use spectral-domain optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) affect eye 12 month follow optic neuritis , robustly predict change RNFL thickness 1 3 month follow symptom onset . Study Population The following cohort recruit three study site : - Up 30 participant acute optic neuritis . - Up 15 healthy volunteer group-wise age- sex-matched participant unilateral optic neuritis . Design This one-year , prospective , multi-cohort , multi-site , pilot natural history study . Data obtain NIH compare aggregate data obtain study site , specifically University Utah-Moran Eye Center ( Salt Lake City ) Hebrew University-Hadassah Medical Center ( Jerusalem , Israel ) . Data gather baseline ( optional ) 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month patient cohort , 1 , 3 , 12 month healthy volunteer . Outcome Measures The primary outcome measure RNFL thickness affect eye 12 month optic neuritis . Secondary outcome measure , measure 12 month , include : - Measures optic nerve structure : mean cross-sectional optic-nerve area ; mean , parallel , perpendicular diffusivity ; MTR within optic nerve lesion visualize baseline . - Measures brain structure : ventricular volume ; T2 lesion volume along visual pathway side consider together . - Measures retinal structure : ganglion cell layer + inner plexiform layer thickness affect eye . - Measures visual function : low-contrast letter acuity ; high-contrast letter acuity ; Pelli-Robson contrast sensitivity ; object-from-motion detection ; visual field ; critical flicker-fusion frequency affect eye . - Measures visual physiology : VEP amplitude ; VEP latency effect eye .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : COHORT 1 : Unilateral optic neuritis . Typical demyelinate optic neuritis base best clinical judgment investigator . Symptom onset within 46 week enrollment OR patient history optic neuritis follow symptom onset Neuroimmunology Branch natural history screen protocol . For woman childbearing potential , willing use acceptable form contraception ( i.e . hormonal contraception ( birth control pill , inject hormone , vaginal ring ) , intrauterine device , barrier method ( condom diaphragm ) spermicide undergone surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , tubal ligation , vasectomy partner ) study duration . Able provide inform consent . Willing able participate aspect trial . COHORT 2 : Healthy volunteer . No medical history would interfere study result interpretation , best clinical judgment investigator . Age great equal 18 year less equal 50 year . Able provide inform consent . Willing able participate aspect trial . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : History sign symptoms suspicious MS , best clinical judgment investigator . PateintsDiseasemodifying therapy MS prior onset current episode optic neuritis ( excludes oral intravenous glucocorticoid : Healthy Volunteers Previous current use diseasemodifying therapy MS ( exclude oral intravenous glucocorticoid . Previous history clinical optic neuritis systemic disease associate optic neuritis ( e.g . sarcoidosis , lymphoma ) . Current prior optic neuropathy ( e.g . trauma , ischemia , glaucoma , optic nerve drusen ) . Previous history retinal disease ( e.g . diabetic retinopathy , retinal drusen ) uveitis . Previous history ophthalmic disease best judgment investigator could affect ophthalmic imaging result . Previous history systemic disease may mimic MS ( e.g . neurosyphilis , neurosarcoidosis , CNS ymphoma , Si ( SqrRoot ) ( Delta ) gren syndrome ) . Previous history systemic disease best judgment investigator could confound study outcome . Current use TNFalpha inhibitor ( e.g . etanercept ) . Habitual use illicit drug best judgment investigator could confound study outcome . Pregnant breastfeeding . Unwilling coenroll Neuroimmunology Branch natural history screen protocol currently 89N0045 . Contraindication MRI scanning .</criteria>
