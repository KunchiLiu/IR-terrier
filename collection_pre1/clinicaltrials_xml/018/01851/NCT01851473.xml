	<brief_summary>Background : - Scientists study medication may useful treat cocaine addiction . It important study know whether study participant always take medication direct . This study look two chemical see use determine whether participant take medication direct . Because acetazolamide quinine measure plasma urine , good test subject study . They give alone , combine intravenous cocaine . Objectives : - To see body handle acetazolamide quinine alone , combine cocaine . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 50 year age smoke used IV cocaine least one year least three time per month three month prior screen . Urine test positive cocaine within prior 6 month Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample also collect . - This study involve 12-day inpatient stay National Institutes Health . - On day 1 , 5 , 10 , participant receive dose cocaine . Blood , urine , breath , saliva sample collect 18 time day 24 hour . - On day 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , participant receive acetazolamide . Regular blood sample collect Day 4 . - Day 6 wash-out day drug blood test . - On day 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , participant receive quinine . Regular blood sample collect Day 9 . - On day 11 , blood , urine , breath , saliva sample collect early morning . Participants able leave later day .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Cocaine dependence public health concern worldwide , FDA-approved pharmacological treatment condition . Thus , need control clinical trial evaluate potential new pharmacological treatment . Adherence medication regime major factor success treatment . In controlled clinical trial , medication adherence often monitor measure specific marker ingested medication . No marker validate use study cocaine dependence treatment . Objective : Evaluate feasibility oral acetazolamide quinine adherence marker trial cocaine dependence treatment determine pharmacodynamic pharmacokinetic interaction intravenous ( IV ) cocaine . Study Population : Up 30 healthy cocaine user age 18-50 year smoke used IV cocaine least one year least three time per month three month prior screen positive urine test cocaine within last 6 month . Experimental Design Methods : Participants admit secure residential research unit undergo baseline assessment Day -1 , receive training Day 0 , receive single dos IV cocaine ( 25 mg ) Days 1 , 5 10 . On Days 1 , 5 , 10 , dry blood spot specimen collect 3 time daily 1.5 h. Single oral dos acetazolamide ( 15 mg ) give Days 2-5 quinine ( 80 mg ) Days 7-10 . Blood , oral fluid , breath specimen collect 71 h , 70 h , 22 h , respectively , drug administration Days 1 , 4 , 5 , 9 10 . Participants wear AutoSense device Days 1 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 8 , 9 10 12 hour day . All void urine collect throughout study . Outcome measure : Primary outcome measure include cocaine , benzoylecgonine , ecgonine methylester , norcocaine , acetazolamide , quinine pharmacokinetics plasma urine whether subjective cardiovascular response IV cocaine change coadministered oral acetazolamide quinine . Secondary outcome measure include cocaine pharmacokinetics oral fluid breath , plasma activity BChE carboxylesterase ( enzymes metabolize cocaine ) , basal post-cocaine administration serum concentration leptin appetitive peptide ( e.g . ghrelin , GLP-1 , insulin , PYY , amylin ) . Benefits : There direct benefit participant , study likely yield generalizable knowledge feasibility acetazolamide quinine marker medication adherence future study pharmacological treatment cocaine dependence . Risks : &lt; TAB &gt; This study pose great minimal risk participant IV cocaine administration .</detailed_description>
