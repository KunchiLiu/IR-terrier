	<brief_summary>The purpose study : ( 1 ) establish assessment technique ( laboratory ) identify functional integrity long spinal tract associate adaptive walking recovery post-spinal cord injury ( 2 ) preliminary investigate locomotor outcomes associate adaptive locomotor train approach post-spinal cord injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Walking Adaptability Post-Spinal Cord Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Eligible individual without spinal cord injury enrol study participate 1-2 day . These individual may undergo variety non-invasive neurophysiological test evaluate spinal reflex integrity specific spinal pathway . In addition , movement may assess walk treadmill overground variety different condition ( e.g . mirror , without mirror , obstacle , without obstacle ) . Eligible individual spinal cord injury enrol study undergo test describe healthy control . In addition , small subset individual may receive locomotor training ( 3 week basic locomotor training follow 3 week adaptive locomotor training , separate 3 week washout period ) . For individual receive locomotor training , test 3 week training session .</detailed_description>
