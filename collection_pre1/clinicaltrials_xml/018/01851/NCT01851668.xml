	<detailed_description>Neonatal intensive care advance significantly recent year result marked decrease mortality , especially extremely low birth weight ( ELBW ) infant ( &lt; 1000g ) . However , observed parallel improvement long term outcomes neurological disability observe EPICure EPICure 2 data . There need explore new avenue neonatal care reduce long term neurodevelopment complication extremely preterm birth . One area receive little attention inter-hospital transfer preterm baby . In UK , like country USA Australia , centralisation neonatal intensive care large tertiary unit ( NICU 's ) result reduced mortality significant morbidity . Data Australia suggest 4-fold increase death ELBW infant transfer tertiary neonatal unit within city ( Melbourne ) . Furthermore , data USA , 69,000 neonatal transport occur year , demonstrate significant increase severe intraventricular haemorrhage ( IVH ) transport infant . Severe IVH associate poor neurological outcome include cerebral palsy . Many ELBW infant transfer within hour life order receive specialist care service . However , first day life represent great risk develop IVH 50 % develop IVH 3 day severe 75 % could go develop cerebral palsy . No causation identify associated significant increase risk IVH likely multifactorial . Such factor could include resuscitation birth early care NICU . However , developed country factor likely less important establishment neonatal network ( share common practice guideline ) international national guidelines/training programme newborn resuscitation . This raise actual transfer preterm infant could represent significant stress infant . Inter-hospital transfer , usually many mile away birth hospital , time early life transition fetus newborn still occur often cardiorespiratory instability . The combination factor increase risk neurological injury immature develop brain , especially period great risk IVH . Although IVH easy identify define risk long term neurodevelopment baby also possibility subtle neurological injury occur . Such injury may detectable ultrasound image alone may require novel biochemical marker detect bodily fluid ( blood , urine ) detail image technique ( magnetic resonance image - MRI ) . A recent study highlight early marker stress correlate poor neurological predictor , regional alteration brain volume ( MRI ) functional motor deficit , ex-preterm infant term correct gestation . As ELBW infant reach school age , grow concern surround increase incidence neurodevelopmental problem child . Many predict problem may stem early life exposure environmental stressor could potentially adverse effect infant 's physiological neurological stability . The presence stressor much evident inter-hospital transportation neonatal unit preterm infant expose noise mechanical vibration . On neonatal unit , characteristic loud noise contribute alarm , ventilator , phone even conversation often exceed recommend hourly level 45 decibel A-weighted scale . Excessive noise level show increase heart rate preterm term infant . A mature biphasic pattern initial cardiac acceleration rebound deceleration observe high birth weight infant , absent milder ELBW infant . Noise also show increase blood pressure , increase respiratory rate , affect sleep cycle . Decreased autonomic self-regulatory ability make ELBW infant vulnerable high noise level due inability filter process noxious stimulus . This could potentially hinder neurodevelopment critical time . During inter-hospital transfer , infant continually expose prolonged , low-frequency , high amplitude mechanical vibration . This mechanical vibration show exceed maximum recommended limit ( 0.31m/s ) adult . In adult human experimental animal vibration find adverse effect cardiovascular function , nervous system , thermoregulatory function , metabolic endocrine function , gastrointestinal system . In animal model , short period vibration , similar experience transported infant , deleterious effect surfactant respiratory function often require support early part preterm infants life . The implication vibration may especially relevant transport ELBW infant could compromise stability observation infant transport . Whilst focus transport ensure safety infant must also explore intervention increase comfort , reduce physical stress improve outcome . No study detail combined physical , physiological biochemical effect inter-hospital transfer infant outcomes . Indeed , many study document sound exposure limit number document vibration ( albeit transport incubator rather baby ) . None study address detailed structured way allow u plan interventional strategy aim reduce stressor . Until detailed data available possible undertake trial aim reduce impact inter-hospital transfer aim improve outcome . The present study first examine physical force baby expose transfer . We also combine measure physiological stability ( i.e . monitor vital sign correlate physical stressor ) well measure key biochemical marker newborn . These biochemical marker include cortisol ( well describe marker short-term stress ) 32 , copeptin ( marker newborn stress ) s100b protein urine ( marker neurological injury ) . Outcome data also analyse . STUDY OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE Hypothesis Inter-hospital transfer ELBW infant first day life adversely impact measure neonatal stress short-term . Aims The Primary aim quantify : ( ) physical stress experience preterm infant inter-hospital transfer early life , Secondary aim quantify : ( ii ) physiological biochemical disruption cause transfer , ( iii ) central nervous system dynamic use advanced computational modelling ascertain potential impact brain injury . STUDY DESIGN This observational study provide feasibility data large interventional trial appropriate sample size . The study 3 element : Study A . Using infant mannequin undertake standard inter-hospital journey similar currently undertake neonatal transport team . The mannequin equip motion detection equipment ( accelerometer ) , position device ( GPS ) noise meter . We examine number intervention aim reduce transport associate motion . This work allow u plan future trial aim improve transport comfort , safety practicality preterm infant . Study B . Establish motion experience neonatal patient current transport method . This element study quantify multi-directional force experience baby transfer . Whilst data available vibration transport incubator , study quantify actual effect baby response key physiological observation ( e.g . heart rate oxygen saturation ) . Data element capture range clinical variable gestation , weight level support . This data , along gather Study C , allow u develop computational model physical stress experience design well transport system . Study C. To quantify , correlate assess physiological biochemical disturbance experience preterm infant undergo inter-hospital transfer . Preterm infant undergo inter-hospital transfer include element .</detailed_description>
