	<brief_title>Safety Pharmacology Study SNX-5422 Subjects With Resistant Lung Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heat shock protein 90 ( Hsp90 ) chaperone proteins stabilize many client protein include mutant EGFR , also hypothesize help maintain malignant phenotype mutant EGFR lung adenocarcinoma . Treatment EGFR mutant cell line Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin result cellular degradation , decrease level pAKT/cyclin D1 , increase apoptosis . Furthermore , Hsp90 inhibitor hamper growth tumor nude mice gefitinib-resistant H1975-xenografts vivo . Clinical data show mono-therapy Hsp90 inhibitor provide stable disease patient partial remission best response heavily pre-treated non small cell lung cancer patient . SNX-5422 pro-drug SNX-2112 , potent , highly selective , small-molecule inhibitor molecular chaperone Hsp90 . Inhibitors chaperone protein Hsp90 current interest central role Hsp90 play maturation maintenance numerous protein , example HER2 mutate EGFR , critical tumor cell viability growth .</detailed_description>
