	<brief_title>Brentuximab Vedotin ( SGN-35 ) Salvage Treatment CD30-positive Germ Cell Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Complete response third-line later salvage chemotherapy ( CT ) germ cell tumor ( GCT ) range 0 % 10 % usually short-lived nearly patient ( pt ) progress multiple course high-dose CT ultimately die progressive disease . Cluster Differentiation antigen-30 ( CD30 ) express untreated embryonal carcinoma ( ECA ) thus lend support rationale target approach . The investigator retrospectively re-assessed ECA strongly retain CD30 staining case ( &gt; 70 % ) , even multiple course high-dose CT . Moreover , negative prognostic value CD30 expression residual CT , particularly salvage setting , set . Brentuximab vedotin antibody-drug conjugate consist chimeric anti-CD30 antibody chemically conjugate antitubulin synthetic analog ( MMAE ) . Proof activity provide rationale develop first-line chemo-immunotherapy maintenance immunotherapy select high-risk pt . The primary objective study activity Brentuximab vedotin refractory GCT . Secondary objective include safety survival . 24 pt biopsy-proven CD30 positive GCT receive intravenous Brentuximab vedotin dose 1.8 mg/Kg every 3 week disease progression onset unacceptable toxicity . Further eligibility requirement include failure 2 3 platinum-based CT ( prior high-dose CT allow ) . All pt undergo measurement serum tumor marker , compute tomography positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan every week . An optimal Simon 's 2-stage design apply . The primary endpoint objective response-rate ( ORR ) . An ORR 5 % promising , 25 % rate promising . In stage 1 , 9 evaluable patient accrue . The type I II error set 10 % . Additional post-treatment tissue available pt undergo surgery treatment time-course . Tissue array block construct sample pt . Assessment include mutational analysis most-frequently mutate gene . Two serum aliquot collect baseline during/end treatment ass circulate CD30 .</detailed_description>
