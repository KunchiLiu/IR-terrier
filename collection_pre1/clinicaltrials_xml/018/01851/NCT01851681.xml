	<brief_title>Comparison Between Two Different Antibiotic Regimens Placement Dental Implants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction After discovery penicillin antimicrobial agent 1928 , later methicillin , important improvement prognosis antimicrobial therapy occur . However , increase trend antibiotic resistance among community-acquired pathogen observe past two decade ( 1 , 2 ) . For example , short period time , S. aureus develop resistance β-lactam compound find penicillin family , 2003 , 50 % S. aureus isolates recover U.S. hospital methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( 3 ) . When resistant bacterium involve clinical infection , prognosis antimicrobial treatment drop significantly patient affected might always survive infection . As health care professional , important minimize exposure patient antibiotic since emergence resistance oral microflora start become threat modern society . This could explain improper use antibiotic , term either dosage ( duration treatment long dose weak ) indication ( 4 , 5 ) . To support statement , three study show low dosage and/or long treatment duration increase risk carriage antibiotic-resistant strain ( 6-8 ) . The demand dental implant increase population due high success rate significant improvement quality life . On hand , use antibiotic common practice oral implantology . In order prevent infection , initially establish implant placement protocol pre- postoperative antibiotic prescribe patient receive dental implant 9 . There many antibiotic regimen use attempt minimize risk infection consequently , increase survival rate dental implant . Initially , recommend give antibiotic least 1 hour implant placement follow daily dos 10 day ( 9 ) . Later , retrospective study demonstrate advantage give antibiotic 1 hour implant placement post-operatively 10 day regard implant survival rate ( 10 ) . A multicenter retrospective study 2,973 implant show significant high survival rate patient receive preoperative antibiotic ( 11 ) . The subject follow 36 month implant placement . In study , 96 % case receive post-operative antibiotic decision prescribe antibiotic coverage regimen follow leave discretion surgeon . Another retrospective study find significant difference failure rate implant place patient receive 1-day single-dose administration antibiotic place patient take 1-week post-operative regimen antibiotic ( 12 ) . The author also state single dose antibiotic prevent dental implant infection efficient enough prevent risk emergence antimicrobial-resistant bacterial strain . Two recent meta-analyses 4 randomized clinical trial compare implant place patient received antibiotic pre- and/or post-operatively show statistically significant high number patient experience implant failure group receive antibiotic ( 13 , 14 ) . To illustrate controversy surround antibiotic prophylaxes dental implant patient , survey private dental practice UK find wide variation antibiotic regimen : prophylactic , postoperative , combination pre- postoperative antibiotic ( 15 ) . Consequently , order prevent overuse antibiotic potential emergence drug resistant bacteria , would advisable find optimal protocol include antibiotic therapy minimal duration implant survival rate would remain unchanged . Very clinical trial look patient-based outcome . Indeed , patient ' pain discomfort experience take account dental implant clinical trial little known prevalence intensity surgery , especially regard different antibiotic regimen . Moreover , show individual take postoperative antibiotic exhibit less crestal bone loss 6 month implant placement compare take antibiotic postoperatively ( 16 ) . However , information available effect antibiotic crestal bone loss newer design implant exhibit platform switch concept . Crestal bone loss around dental implant recently associate high peri-implant crevicular fluid ( PICF ) concentration biomarkers ( pg/μL ) involve bone metabolism metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) , osteoprotegerin ( OPG ) ( 17 , 18 ) . The membrane bound soluble RANKL ( sRANKL ) find significantly high PICF level peri-implantitis site compare healthy site ( 19 ) . To knowledge , prospective study oral implantology compare two antibiotic regimen look subject-based outcome , clinical , radiographic immunological outcome simultaneously . Therefore , aim prospective two-arm randomize clinical trial compare crestal bone loss , PICF concentration three select biomarkers bone loss , pain experience interference daily activity , postoperative morbidity ( swell , bruising , wind dehiscence suppuration ) 2 different antibiotic regimens patient undergo dental implant surgery . Hypothesis Specific aim The study 's null hypothesis difference crestal bone loss around implant 2 different antibiotic regimen . The primary objective study : 1 . To find whether give pre- and/or postoperative antibiotic implant placement would significantly change crestal bone loss around implant . The secondary objective : 2 . To assess patient 's perception post-operative healing process antibiotic regimen . 3 . To assess surgeon 's perception post-operative healing process antibiotic regimen . Materials &amp; Methods Study design Subjects randomize controlled clinical trial divide two group : one group receive 2 g amoxicillin 1 h prior surgery 500mg three time day 7 day ; second group receive 2 g amoxicillin 1 h prior surgery identical placebo three time day 7 day . Participants Fifty patient attend undergraduate implantology clinic Faculté de Médecine Dentaire Université de Montréal invite participate study ( see Appendix II detail sequence appointment ) . The following inclusion criterion study : - Periodontally healthy remain dentition present mild gingivitis adequate oral hygiene . - Presence partially edentulous alveolar ridge plan restore 2 implant . - To 1 2 implant restore crown fixed bridge . - Presence non-infected site . - Presence enough bone soft tissue implant place without additional bone augmentation 1-stage approach ( heal abutment ) . - Implants 8mm long longer . - Subjects able willing provide write informed consent comply study procedure . The exclusion criterion follow : - Subjects take regular analgesic antidepressant . - Smoking 10 cigarettes/cigars per day . - Drug abuse . - Completely edentulous individual . - Pregnant nursing woman . - Allergies amoxicillin , cephalosporin , and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesic . - To active peptic ulcer susceptibility peptic ulcer . - Any systemic local immunodeficiency . - Any blood coagulation impairment . - Presence uncontrolled periodontitis poor oral hygiene . - Presence acute oral infection . - Presence uncontrolled diabetes systemic disease . - Previous radiation therapy head neck area . - Intravenous bisphosphonates . - Oral bisphosphonates intake 3 year . - Long-term intake corticosteroid . - Need routine prophylactic antibiotic prior dental surgery . Prior data collection , consent form approve institutional review board Université de Montréal ( Comité d'éthique de la recherché en santé ) present participant initial consultation . All study procedure undertake understand write consent participant accord ethical principle include World Medical Association Declaration Helsinki . Medical socio-demographic data collection An investigator research assistant , one surgeon , approach recruit individual accept treatment plan dental implant ( ) restore partially edentulous jaw implant dentistry clinic Faculty Dentistry ( CRIP ) . Medical history , smoke habit ( smoker , non-smokers ) , ethnicity , gender age obtain medical questionnaire use Faculty Dentistry include statistical analysis . Clinical procedure data collection Dental implant ( ) ( Osseospeed™ TX Osseospeed™ TX Profile , Astra Tech Implant System™ , Dentsply Implants , Mölndal , Sweden ) place one stage procedure , without simultaneous bone grafting , inserted implantology clinic Université de Montréal - Faculty Dentistry ( CRIP ) one three board-certified specialist experience implant surgeon ( RD , RV , PB ; minimum 10 year experience ) . All participant instruct rinse chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12 % 1 min . surgery take 1 hour surgical appointment 2 g amoxicillin . A third party give envelope patient contain antibiotic take postoperatively patient 's study number surgeon unaware antibiotic regimen . Subjects randomly distribute one two study group : - 2 g amoxicillin take 1 hour preoperatively 500mg identical placebo three time per day 7 day ; - 2 g amoxicillin take 1 hour preoperatively 500mg amoxicillin take three time per day 7 day . Subject 's allocation do block 4 subject computer-generated sequence seal consecutively numbered opaque envelope . The subject receive research assistant envelop contain either one antibiotic regimen specific instruction take medication . The participant take antibiotic supervision research assistant . Additional measure asepsis include use sterile drape around patient 's head supine body patient . Screw-type , root-form , two-piece rough surface dental implant place use standard surgical protocol , follow manufacturer ' recommendation . Mucoperiosteal flap use access underlie alveolar bone implant surgery . The heal abutment insert instead cover screw , soft tissue suture interrupted suture ( 4-0 silk , Perma Sharp® , Hu-Friedy Mfg Co. , Chicago , U.S.A. ) . A standardized radiograph take perpendicular crestal bone ass baseline crestal bone level mesial distal aspect implant use bite registration material ( Blu-Mousse® , Parkell Inc. , Edgewood , U.S.A. ) adapt parallel device ( XCP film hold system , Dentsply Rinn , Elgin , U.S.A. ) participant . The customized bite registration keep patient cool room lock cabinet participant study identification number subsequent 4 month 1-year radiographic evaluation . The duration surgery length incision record surgeon . The participant ask refrain perform mechanical plaque control surgical area advise remain soft diet first postoperative week . To minimize influence independent variable , prescribe 600mg ibuprofen take every 4 hour first 48 hour maximum 4 tab per day . They also prescribe emergency analgesic ( 500mg acetaminophen ) take need 0.12 % chlorhexidine gluconate rinse use twice daily suture remove 1 week later . After receive standardized verbal write post-operative instruction , participant give questionnaire assess postoperative pain interference daily activity first postoperative week . The patient ask keep pain medication diary keep track number analgesic ( ibuprofen acetaminophen ) take first postoperative week . The patient ask record his/her experience interference daily activity use 10-cm VAS questionnaire end point `` none '' `` extremely much '' ( 20 ) attribute numerical value his/her pain intensity experience use Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS-11 ) , 0 represent `` pain '' 10 `` intolerable '' . The patient 's pain experience also assess daily pain medication intake diary . Daily activity include ability chew food want eat , open mouth wide , talk , sleep , go school work , carry regular social life participate favorite recreational activity . The subject ask bring back research assistant pain daily interference questionnaire well envelope drug container ensure compliance prescription . At end first postoperative control appointment , one two calibrate examiner unaware antibiotic regimen prescribe ask fill questionnaire evaluate swelling , bruising , pu exudate wind dehiscence describe elsewhere 20 . Postoperative swell graded follow : 0 = No swelling , 1 = Mild swelling , 2 = Moderate swelling , 3 = Severe swell . Postoperative bruising , suppuration wind dehiscence evaluate use Boolean variable : 0 = None ; 1 = Present . The examiner measure modify plaque index ( PI ) ( 21 ) four site per implant ( mesial , distal , buccal , lingual ) . The PI grade follow : 0 = detection plaque , 1 = Plaque detect run probe ( PCP-UNC15 ; Hu-Friedy Mfg Co. , Chicago , U.S.A. ) along smooth surface heal abutment , 2 = Plaque see naked eye , 3 = Abundance soft matter . The PI also measure 3-weeks 16-weeks examination . He collect PICF sample detect presence MMP-8 , sRANKL OPG mesial surface implant first postoperative appointment also 3-weeks 16-weeks examination . Briefly , supragingival plaque present , remove gently gauze . The sample site isolated cotton roll carefully dry . A filter strip ( PerioPaper , Oraflow Inc. , Smithtown , NY , U.S.A. ) place 30 peri-implant sulcus . The collected sample immediately transfer sterile 1 ml tube contain 100 μl phosphate buffer saline , centrifuge 10 min , store - 80 °C analysis . At laboratory , enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) use assess PICF level MMP-8 ( Quantikine-Human Total MMP-8 Immunoassay , R &amp; D Systems Inc. , Minneapolis , U.S.A ) , sRANKL OPG ( Biomedica , Gruppe , Vienna ) . At 3-weeks appointment , postoperative swelling , bruising , suppuration wind dehiscence evaluate well modify PI . PICF sample also collect . At 16-weeks evaluation , implant re-assessed clinically radiographically confirm osseointegration modify PI PICF sample collect . This appointment coincide impression restoration implant . The calibrated examiner unaware antibiotic regimen take verify implant osseointegrated take standardized periapical radiograph verify presence absence infection evaluate crestal bone loss use standardize bite registration parallel device . The examiner also assess implant mobility use handle two blunt dental instrument ( 22 ) ( osseointegration = immobile , failure = mobile ) presence absence symptom relate infection ( suppuration ) , inflammation ( erythema , bleed probe ) neuropathy ( paresthesia , dysesthesia , anesthesia ) ( 23 ) . Four month one year implant placement , standardize radiograph take measure crestal bone loss . Subtraction radiographic analysis do use software ( Image J , National Institutes Health , Bethesda , U.S.A. ) measure mean mesial distal bone loss around implant one investigator unaware antibiotic regimen take participant . Ethical issue To make sure patient implantology clinic feel obligate participate study , research assistant give potential participant write information ongoing study clinic ( `` Feuille d'information et de recrutement '' ) . The patient tell read information wait dental chair treatment finish home let know dental care provider decision sure willing participate . The provider notify research assistant patient 's interest participating study indeed case . At time , information consent form present patient interested participate study . Since dental record number participant write questionnaires identification purpose , third party ( research assistant ) remove dental record number replace study code prior data analysis . The third party place questionnaires folder contain study number participant . The folder contain research data keep locked office principal investigator Université de Montréal . The principal investigator ensure entire process data collection research team follow rule ethic member research team access room data keep . Only third party possession sheet dental record number match study code . Sample size calculation Assuming difference crestal bone loss study group would 0.5 mm standard deviation 0.5mm , sample size 17 participant group would provide power 80 % reject null hypothesis absence between-group difference indeed false , alpha level 5 % . This difference 0.5 mm generally consider clinically significant ( 24 ) . Outcome measure The primary outcome measure crestal bone loss mesial distal aspect implant . The secondary outcome presence absence peri-implant radiolucency , patient 's pain experience ( intensity ( VAS ) number analgesic take ) , surgeon 's perception healing ( intensity swell presence/absence bruising , pu exudate wound dehiscence ) , PICF level MMP-8 , sRANKL , OPG , modify PI , presence absence implant mobility , presence absence pain , infection , neuropathy , pu exudate . Statistical analysis Two train calibrated examiner perform clinical measurement take radiograph . An intra- inter-reliability study do compare gold standard examiner . One calibrate examiner extensive experience perform radiographic analysis . Cohen 's kappa , intraclass correlation coefficient Bland Altman graph use evaluate reliability . Normality data distribution assess use Shapiro-Wilk test . Normalization use case non-normal distribution . Crestal bone loss , PICF level patient 's pain perception ( VAS ) analyze repeated measure ANOVA , time repeat measure ( 7 day ) group group measure . Groups compare regard postoperative swell Kruskall-Wallis one-way ANOVA Mann-Whitney U test . Groups compare regard implant survival 4 month , bruising , suppuration , wound dehiscence , mobility , presence pu exudate , presence peri-implant radiolucency radiograph , presence persistent signs/symptoms Fisher 's exact test . Analyses conduct conformity intention treat principle . Relevance result To knowledge , first prospective randomize control clinical trial compare crestal bone loss two different antibiotic regimen include simultaneously patient-based outcome , clinical , immunological radiographic measure . The result study might allow dentist oral surgeon establish optimal antibiotic regimen minimize patient exposure potential stimulation bacterial resistance reduce antibiotic intake .</detailed_description>
