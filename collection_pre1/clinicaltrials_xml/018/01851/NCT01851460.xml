	<brief_summary>Background : - Abscesses pocket infection organ tissue . Patients disease call chronic granulomatous disease ( CGD ) often develop abscess . CGD inherit disorder affect white blood cell function . Liver abscesses people CGD often require surgery remove treat infection . However , people CGD full surgery would risky . Researchers want try procedure call radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) treat liver abscess . RFA usually do without major operation . This study see RFA safe effective treatment liver abscesses patient CGD . Objectives : - To see RFA safe effective treatment CGD-related liver abscess . Eligibility : - Individuals 18 75 year age CGD liver abscess treat surgery . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . Imaging study perform liver . - Participants RFA abscess . RFA image-guided technique heat destroy specific tissue , tumor tissue . It target abscesses liver . - After procedure , participant stay hospital monitoring release . - Participants regular follow-up visit 1 year treatment . Blood urine sample collect . Additional imaging study perform .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiofrequency Ablation Liver Abscesses From Chronic Granulomatous Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Radiofrequency Ablation ( RFA ) become increasingly common therapeutic treatment neoplasms liver . A number device Food Drug Administration clear indication , grow body literature support technique therapeutic option patient primary metastatic hepatic malignancy . In vivo animal study also show technique also use treat infection . Insertion thermal energy delivery probe infect liver abscess destroys bacteria preserve surround tissue . Off-label use RFA successfully use treat 22 abscess 4 patient chronic granulomatous disease inoperable liver abscess . The proposed clinical trial specifically evaluate feasibility , safety , less extent , efficacy RFA treat liver abscesses subject previously diagnose chronic granulomatous disease . This non-randomized case study conduct Clinical Center National Institutes Health . One RFA device use . Ten subject enrol . If method prof feasible safe , detailed analysis efficacy perform . RFA eventually could play important clinical role patient chronic granulomatous disease liver abscesses amenable surgical management without effective therapeutic option , might otherwise incompletely treated surgical resection debridement alone .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION/ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA : A patient include meet follow criterion : 1 . Has document chronic granulomatous disease 2 . Age 18 75 3 . Has liver abscess infected Staphylococcus aureus , optimal candidate curative surgical resection either due location disease , multiplicity disease , previous surgery comorbidities , pulmonary insufficiency , contraindication general anesthesia perioperative management refuse surgery . 4 . Is willing return NIH image scan 5 . Is willing undergo testing procedure associate protocol 6 . Has fail long term antibiotic treatment abscess drainage applicable . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : A patient exclude satisfies 1 follow criterion : 1 . Positive result toxinproducing bacteria obtain liver biopsy pertinent abscess . 2 . Is good candidate livercurative open surgical resection refuse surgery 3 . Is candidate RFA therapy due lesion size , location , and/or infection non staphylococcal bacteria . 4 . Has prothrombin time ( PT ) partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) &gt; 1.5 time normal ( except patient know lupus anticoagulant condition hematologist deem cause excessive bleeding despite abnormal coagulation parameter ) . 5 . Has platelet count &lt; 50,000/mm ( 3 ) maintain despite platelet transfusion . 6 . If pregnant . 7 . Any condition , investigator opinion , place patient undue risk participate study Please Note : Comorbidities critically ill patient constitute exclusion criterion cause illness/condition may require use RFA less invasive treatment surgery .</criteria>
