	<brief_summary>Background : - TRC102 new cancer treatment drug may help improve result chemotherapy . It block tumor cell ' attempt repair damage DNA , may allow chemotherapy kill cell easily . Researchers want see well work temozolomide , chemotherapy drug design damage tumor cell DNA . These drug give people advance solid tumor lymphomas respond earlier treatment . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness TRC102 temozolomide advance solid tumor lymphomas . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age advance solid tumor lymphomas respond earlier treatment . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . Tumor sample may also collect . The size location tumor determine image study . - Participants take TRC102 temozolomide 28-day cycle treatment . They take temozolomide TRC 102 mouth day day 1-5 . Participants keep diary record dose side effect . - Treatment monitor frequent blood test image study . Tumor sample also collect . - Participants continue treatment long cancer grow severe side effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TRC102 Temozolomide Relapsed Solid Tumors Lymphomas</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : -Base excision repair ( BER ) DNA repair pathway implicate resistance alkylating antimetabolite chemotherapy . -TRC102 ( methoxyamine HCl ) act novel mechanism inhibit BER demonstrate ability potentiate activity alkylating agent temozolomide ( TMZ ) , vitro vivo . We hypothesize TRC102 safely co-administered TMZ would potentiate DNA damage cause TMZ , result antitumor response . - Based response measure Phase I portion trial , explore efficacy combination patient metastatic colon carcinoma , nonsmall cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , granulosa cell ovarian cancer Primary Objective : -To establish safety , tolerability , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) oral TRC102 combination oral TMZ patient refractory solid tumor -Evaluate pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile oral TRC102 administer combination TMZ . -To explore response rate combination patient colon cancer , NSCLC , granulosa cell ovarian cancer Secondary Objectives : - Determine effect study treatment level histone gammaH2AX circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) tumor correlate gammaH2AX response tumor CTCs - Determine effect study treatment level cleave caspase 3 , epithelialmesenchymal transition , APE tumor CTCs - To explore resistance mechanism study drug combination - Determine characterize effect study treatment erythrocytes - Characterize clinical presentation hemolysis observe earlier study subject explore possible mechanism -To explore progression free survival rate combination patient colon cancer , NSCLC , granulosa cell ovarian cancer Eligibility : -Phase I : histologically confirm solid tumor progress standard therapy know prolong survival standard treatment option exist -Phase II : histologically confirm adenocarcinoma colon post least two line therapy , NSCLC post least two line therapy , granulosa cell ovarian cancer post least one line therapy - No major surgery , radiation , chemotherapy within 4 week prior enter study - Adequate organ function - Healthy adult volunteer great equal 18 year age consent donate research blood Study Design : Phase I - This open-label Phase I trial ; traditional 3+3 design . - Oral TRC102 oral TMZ administer daily , day 1-5 28-day cycle - Once MTD establish , 15 additional patient enrol MTD evaluate dose PK PD endpoints evidence DNA damage apoptosis . -During escalation phase , tumor biopsy optional . During expansion phase , ( MTD reach ) , mandatory paired tumor biopsy pursue 15 additional patient enrol evaluate PD endpoint . Phase II -This 3-arm Simon 2-stage design trial evaluate independently response rate patient colon , NSCLC , granulosa cell ovarian cancer . - All patient receive 125 mg TRC 102 150 mg/m2 TMZ PO qday x 5 every 28 day . Each cycle 28 day . - The accrual ceiling Phase II portion 75 patient . - Mandatory paired tumor biopsy pursue evaluate PD endpoint .</detailed_description>
