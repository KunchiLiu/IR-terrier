	<brief_summary>In recent year , diabetes emerge one significant co-diseases many Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) patient develop . Type 1 ( T1D ) Type 2 ( T2D ) diabetes result either body make enough insulin body respond correctly insulin , respectively . Insulin hormone make cell pancreas help carry glucose ( sugar ) food eat cell body energy . While cystic fibrosis relate diabetes ( CFRD ) many feature similar T1D T2D , patient CF may symptoms either T1D T2D patient . Currently , little understanding CFRD best option treatment remain unclear . The purpose research study examine understand various mechanism contribute CFRD gain well understanding potential mean treat CFRD . In particular , plan study effect incretin hormone enhance insulin production CF patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Beta-cell Response Incretin Hormones Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Previously , cystic fibrosis relate diabetes ( CFRD ) consider consequence damage pancreas therefore cell contain pancreas -- i.e. -- islet house beta cell , make release insulin ( similar T1D ) . Recent evidence suggest factor may also associate similar T2D . For example , patient T2D , decrease secretion incretins , hormone release small intestine response nutrient food act , among thing , increase insulin secretion Beta cell pancreas . When patient T2D treat incretin hormone , pancreatic Beta cell release insulin ( measure 'second phase insulin secretion ' ) . Currently , know patient CFRD decrease incretin secretion like T2D treat CFRD patient incretin hormone improve insulin level . This study measure insulin release Beta cell CFRD patient ( second phase insulin secretion ) give incretin hormone vein . This compare insulin release patient give placebo ( salt contain solution ) . The patient research team know give result collect . The result provide unbiased evidence incretins help improve insulin release CFRD patient .</detailed_description>
