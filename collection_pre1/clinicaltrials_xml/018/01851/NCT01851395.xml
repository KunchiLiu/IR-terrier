	<brief_summary>Background : - People lung cancer unfortunately commonly succumb disease . Some agree donate body cancer research may help medical community well understand disease . Studies lung cancer tumor tissue obtain soon death may use answer question origin , progression , treatment lung cancer . Researchers want conduct study involve plan collection lung cancer tumor tissue shortly death . To , arrange provide inpatient hospice care people non-small cell lung cancer . &lt; TAB &gt; Objectives : - To collect lung cancer tissue biopsy sample soon possible death . Eligibility : - Individuals non-small cell lung cancer plan receive end-of-life hospice care . Design : - Participants agree receive inpatient hospice care National Institutes Health Clinical Center . Full detail end-of-life instruction note . - An autopsy perform clinical center within 3 hour death . Tumor tissue collect primary site cancer area body cancer spread . - Participants receive cancer treatment part study . This tissue collection study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rapid Autopsy Procurement Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Tissue</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background - Despite lead cause cancer-related death worldwide , limited knowledge tumor heterogeneity lung cancer . There also limit knowledge tumor heterogeneity less common thoracic malignancy , thymic epithelial tumor mesothelioma . - Tumor heterogeneity evaluate comprehensive manner deep sequencing global analysis genomic proteomic alteration simultaneous core biopsy several area primary tumor metastasis correlation clinical outcome . However study feasible clinical setting . - Tissue procurement rapid autopsy provide effective way investigation . Hypothesis - Clonal evolution selection tumor cell assess examine genomic proteomic alteration tumor sample obtain multiple site primary metastatic site . Objectives - Procure primary metastatic tissue thoracic malignancy shortly death order investigate tumor heterogeneity- intratumor pair primary metastatic site , use integrated genomic proteomic analysis . Eligibility - Adult patient metastatic non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) , extrapulmonary small cell cancer ( ESCCs ) , pulmonary neuroendocrine tumor ( PNETs ) , thymic epithelial tumor , mesothelioma life expectancy less equal 3 month Design - Twelve patient NSCLC , SCLC , thymic epithelial tumor , mesothelioma , six ESCCs pNETs autopsied pilot study . - Patients admitted inpatient hospice investigator estimate survival less 2 week . - Upon expiration , rapid autopsy perform tissue obtain primary tumor site still identifiable , multiple metastatic site assess tumor heterogeneity use deep sequencing global genomic proteomic analysis . - Archival tissue patient , available , used evaluate change several stage tumor progression .</detailed_description>
