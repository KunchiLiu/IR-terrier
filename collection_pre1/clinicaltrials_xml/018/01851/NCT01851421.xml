	<brief_summary>Background : - Melanocortin receptor proteins body help send message body system . One receptor , melanocortin 3 receptor ( MC3R ) , important regulating body weight . Differences MC3R affect fat metabolism - body handle fat . Some people change MC3R genetic code heavier change . These change find often African Americans . Researchers want study MC3R African American adult see change may affect fat metabolism . They look overweight adult either common genetic code MC3R rare variant . Objectives : - To study role MC3R body weight fat metabolism . Eligibility : - Healthy African American volunteer 18 55 year age . - Volunteers must overweight ( body mass index least 30 kg/m2 ) weigh less 450 lb . Design : - The study consist outpatient screen visit 7-day inpatient visit dietary study . - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood sample collect . ( Participants need fast 10 hour give blood sample . ) A body scan give determine fat , bone , muscle content . Participants complete 3-day dietary assessment record food drink consumption . They also exercise test look heart lung function . - Participants 7-day inpatient stay . They regular diet first 3 day study . For final 4 day , diet high fat content . - During inpatient visit , participant follow study procedure : - Body measurement - Daily exercise routine - Imaging study body - Measurement whole day energy expenditure ( spend one day metabolic chamber-day 5 ) - Frequent blood sample - Urine collection 24 hour ( day 3 7 ) - Fat biopsy ( collection small sample fat tissue skin abdomen ) - Insulin metabolism test eat two different diet ( day 4 day 7 ) . - After final insulin metabolism test , participant discharge study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our prior study find child homozygosity two rare Melanocortin 3 Receptor ( MC3R ) polymorphism ( T6K+V81I ) great fat mass compare wild type child . These polymorphisms 10-fold prevalent Non-Hispanic Black White Americans . In vitro , T6K+V81I cause MC3R hypofunction . Since mouse model limit human data suggest MC3R may involve regulate substrate oxidation , therefore fatty acid disposal , propose study 30 Non-Hispanic Black BMI-matched subject homozygous T6K+V81I wild-type MC3R compare substrate turnover ( fatty acid glucose ) fast condition hyperinsulinemia adaptation normal-fat high-fat isocaloric diet . Using adipocytes obtain biopsy , also study glucose fatty acid uptake , storage mobilization vitro . We hypothesize study shed light role MC3R substrate metabolism energy expenditure , yield information may assist development effective approach treatment obesity Non-Hispanic Black Americans .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Volunteers qualify meet follow criterion 1 . Age 1855 year . Subject age limit 55y maximum subject require complete maximal exercise test part evaluation . Studying young patient decrease risk exercise test . 2 . NonHispanic Black selfidentification ( best subject knowledge ) 4 grandparent consider NonHispanic Black . Because T6K+V81I MC3R 10times prevalent among NonHispanic Blacks , NonHispanic Blacks eligible participate . 3 . Obesity , define body mass index ( BMI ) ( Bullet ) 30 kg/m2 weight 450 lb , order subject able undergo DXA scanning . 4 . Willing undergo genetic screen establish subject either homozygous wild type MC3R homozygous T6K+V81I MC3R , absence genetic cause monogenic obesity ( study control group ) . 5 . Good general health . In general , subject take medication . However , individual take medication obesityrelated comorbid condition , change dosage 6 month , may include , discretion principal investigator . 6 . For female , negative pregnancy test initial evaluation . Because pregnancy state weight gain expect appropriate , pregnant individual would suitable study . Sexually active woman must use effective form birth control . These method include abstinence , oral contraceptive , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , levonogestrol implant ( Norplant ) , medroxyprogesterone acetate injection ( Depoprovera shot ) . If one use , contraceptive foam condom recommend ( One method must use subject least two month prior start study ) . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Volunteers exclude ( referred nonexperimental treatment program need ) follow reason : 1 . Subjects major medical illness opinion medical team would impede interpretation result , include significant renal , hepatic ( obesityrelated steatosis ) , gastrointestinal , endocrinologic ( e.g. , Cushing syndrome , untreated hyper hypothyroidism , pheochromocytoma ) , hematological problem ( e.g . PT/PTT value prolong ( Bullet ) 3 second upper limit normal thrombocytopenia &lt; 70,000 ) pulmonary disorder ; porphyria ; 2 . Current user tobacco product ; 3 . Subjects follow diet specific food requirement vegetarian , vegan , kosher ; 4 . Women pregnant currently nurse infant irregular menses ; 5 . Individuals current substance abuse psychiatric disorder condition opinion investigator would impede competence adherence ; 6 . Recent ( 3 month ) use anorexiant medication ; 7 . Subjects use medication know affect glucose fatty acid metabolism and/or absorption ; 8 . Subjects anticoagulatns , safely stop NSAIDs antiplataelet agent 10 day ( week prior three day biopsy ) 9 . Subjects weight change 3 % body weight past two month ; 10 . Subjects currently use weight loss diet ; 11 . Subjects untreated hypertension : consistently ( 2 week apart ) elevate systolic blood pressure great 160 mm Hg and/or diastolic flood pressure great 95 mm Hg . 12 . Subjects history keloid formation , since individual may great scar biopsy intravenous catheter placement .</criteria>
