	<detailed_description>Molecular test tumor , use technique next-generation sequencing ( NGS ) , facilitate individualized approach cancer treatment sub-classifying disease individual basis . Physicians utilize depth understand disease molecular level optimize therapy select appropriate drug therapeutic target . Genomic profile identify multiple genomic aberration predictive marker treatment response target therapeutic . FoundationOne™ commercially available molecular diagnostics test , solid tumor type , analyze routine clinical specimen somatic alteration relevant cancer-related gene . This validated vitro diagnostic test , perform single Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments ( CLIA ) certify College American Pathologists ( CAP ) approve laboratory Foundation Medicine , Inc . It provide individualized , potentially actionable information regard patient 's molecular cancer subtype use physician tailor treatment option . With recent commercial availability FoundationOne™ test , knowledge gap exist regard practice pattern associate use test routine clinical practice impact test clinical decision making . There limited information regard physician patient characteristic determine patient receive test , rationale patient selection , physician interpret use test result . Findings study help optimize patient selection maximize clinical impact test term guide therapy .</detailed_description>
