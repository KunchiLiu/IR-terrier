	<detailed_description>Overweight obesity health problem utmost importance world population . The continuous development consumption high-energy food low cost correlate increase risk diabetes insulin resistance addition weight gain . To maintain body weight , balance energy intake energy expenditure must obtain . Since weight gain common outcome energy-dense diet , best approach reduce caloric intake consumption fruit vegetable . However , approach usually unsatisfactory long-term loss tasty food low reward healthy meal often undermine nutritionally prudent diet . A possible alternative approach produce tasty food low caloric density satiety-inducing compound reduce caloric intake increase sensation satiety . The human body regulate energy intake complex interconnect biological system involve gut-brain axis , endocannabinoid system hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis . Biomarkers hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis regulate food intake physiological response stress . In absence food , brain sens hunger elevation gastrointestinal hormone ghrelin . Once food ingest , ghrelin level decrease biomarkers gut-brain axis release increase feeling satiety delay gastric emptying , decrease appetite decrease food intake . Recent study mice link endocannabinoid system hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis physiological stress energy homeostasis . Furthermore , endocannabinoids anandamide 2-arachidonoylglycerol elevated hunger decrease feeding . Natural food low energy density , fruit vegetable , usually contain high amount dietary fiber . Dietary fiber classify either soluble fiber ( beta-glucans ) insoluble fiber ( wheat bran ) soluble insoluble fiber strongly link increased satiety sensation . Dietary fiber important properly function gastrointestinal tract provide nutrient source bacteria large intestine . When 3 % portion barley beta-glucans add fruit drink bread consume breakfast , reduction energy intake 30 % 24 hour observe along beneficial change post-prandial gastrointestinal hormone involve biological control hunger satiety . Intake insoluble fiber improve insulin sensitivity enrich barley fiber bread wheat fiber bread improve ghrelin peptide YY ( PYY ) hormone response compare control bread . A recently characterize class food compound , melanoidins , find exhibit similar property dietary fiber gastrointestinal tract . Melanoidins form Maillard reaction process reaction protein reduce carbohydrate sugar cook heat-treated food . Melanoidins large insoluble partially insoluble complex present coffee , bread , cocoa , beer . However , main source melanoidins diet coffee bread contribution 0.5-2.0 g/day coffee melanoidins 1.8-15 g/day bread melanoidins . Research show coffee melanoidins ferment gastrointestinal tract bread melanoidins stimulate bifidobacteria large intestine . Bitter compound also recently implicate increase satiety beneficial effect gastrointestinal tract hormone . Recent research animal indicate several bitter compound reduce rate gastric emptying , induce secretion satiety-inducing hormone cholecystokinin glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) , decrease food intake . However , animal experiment require bitter compound deliver directly stomach action . A bitter tasting vegetable , include broccoli chicory , show beneficial health effect . Some natural phytochemical polyphenols know possess different biological mechanism bitter taste . The plant specie Gentiana lutea L. produce several biologically active bitter phytochemical , include iridoid ( loganic acid ) secoiridoids ( swertiamarin , gentiopicroside , amarogentin , sweroside ) . Gentiana lutea L. use often production herbal teas liqueur . In randomized , crossover trial , hunger satiety feeling measure blood collect specific time point seven arm . Since intervention develop tasty food increase satiety decrease energy intake short term , bitter compound also encapsulate protective coating . Encapsulation commonly use protect pharmaceutical passage oral cavity stomach enable active compound properly absorb body . The coating use one arm allow Gentiana lutea L. extract pas oral cavity , allow volunteer taste bitter compound , target stomach duodenum . All volunteer participate seven arm study . Three different fiber-enriched bread control bread consume addition skim milk breakfast four intervention . In three intervention , participant consume control pudding , Gentiana lutea L. extract pudding encapsulate Gentiana lutea L. extract pudding . A one-week washout period include two separate intervention . The hedonic feeling satiety , hunger , appetite measure questionnaire time 0 ( baseline ) 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 3 hour breakfast . After 3 hour , volunteer consume lunch satiate keep food diary record intake throughout rest day . In addition , blood collect time point amount specific hormone , neuropeptides , endocannabinoids measure part secondary outcome .</detailed_description>
