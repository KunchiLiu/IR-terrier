	<brief_summary>Despite widespread agreement continuous positive airway pressure effective therapy obstructive sleep apnea , estimate 50 % patient recommend therapy noncompliant 1 year later . Nasal continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) definitive medical therapy obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . Many patient difficulty tolerate nasal CPAP due nasal airway problem , mouth leak , general discomfort mask headgear . Interventions improve compliance patient study . The investigator plan evaluate usage CPAP identify time last meal bedtime affect compliance tolerance CPAP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OSA chronic disorder characterize frequent reduction and/or cessation inspiratory airflow sleep , result hypoxemia hypercapnia terminate arousal . This pattern repetitive arousal nocturnal hypoxemia lead disruption sleep architecture daytime hyper-somnolence well multitude neurobehavioral cardiopulmonary derangement . All patient diagnose OSA instruct undergo behavioral change weight loss , avoidance alcohol sedative , sleep side improvement sleep hygiene , keep regular sleep schedule get adequate amount sleep . Continuous Positive Airways Pressure ( CPAP ) currently consider cornerstone therapy sleep apnea ( OSA ) . However compliance treatment frequently poor , may lead ongoing symptom sleep disruption , daytime sleepiness poor wake cognitive function . Mechanical psychological/educational intervention propose try increase hour use CPAP therapy . In old male patient OSA , compliance CPAP therapy associate attendance patient CPAP education support group . Resolution symptom therapy also appear associate enhanced compliance . Some study suggest direct causal relationship OSA gastro esophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) . The investigator hypothesize compliance tolerance CPAP affect time last meal bedtime may also affect symptom GERD .</detailed_description>
