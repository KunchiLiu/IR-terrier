	<brief_title>Prone Patient Positioning Reducing Tumor Motion Improving Breathing Reproduction Patients With Lung Cancer Undergoing Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Quantify three-dimensional tumor normal tissue ( thoracic abdominal ) motion , deformation volume change respiratory cycle image prone vs. supine positioning . II . Quantify three-dimensional tumor normal tissue ( thoracic abdominal ) motion , deformation volume change respiratory cycle alteration thereof radiotherapy series . OUTLINE : Patients undergo one conventional compute tomography ( CT ) scan one 4 dimensional CT ( 4D CT ) scan supine prone position undergoing radiation therapy .</detailed_description>
