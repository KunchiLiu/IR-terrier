	<brief_summary>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) relatively common medical condition include upper-airway obstruction consequent cessation breathe sleep significant associate medical problem . The time period around surgery demonstrate independent risk factor various complication mechanism well understood . This protocol propose study fundamental question change occur postoperative set ambulatory patient without OSA administer validate `` STOP-BANG '' screen questionnaire conduct preoperative postoperative Home Sleep Testing ( HST ) . In , critical evidence shall gain understanding postoperative sleep disorder breathing change associate surgery anesthesia . With evidence , sound perioperative management recommendation policy may develop assist care large risk surgical population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) highly prevalent syndrome upper-airway obstruction consequent cessation respiration sleep . Associated complication include impairment cardiovascular cerebrovascular , neurological endocrine system . There grow concern perioperative period may acutely worsen exist OSA potentially induce sleep disorder breathe susceptible individual . Indeed , presence OSA show independent risk factor perioperative complication . The mechanism perioperative risk , however , yet fully elucidate . This study propose investigate relationship surgical anesthesia OSA observational prospective single-blinded investigation . A sample 600 adult female male orthopedic surgery patient schedule elective ambulatory orthopedic surgery WRNMMC enrol . Study subject shall undergo unattended Home Sleep Test ( HST ) night surgery follow surgery anesthesia determine surgical team unchanged study participation . Following surgical procedure anesthesia , study subject undergo series two additional HSTs first night follow surgery post-operative night three complete postoperative questionnaire include validate screen questionnaire information pertain postoperative pain medication use . Qualitative quantitative analysis perform data . The prevalence ambulatory orthopedic population screen positive STOP-BANG questionnaire , validate Obstructive Sleep Apnea ( OSA ) screen tool , determine well prevalence OSA diagnose preoperative Home Sleep Test ( HST ) . The analysis HST data blind OSA status , know , screen result use validated `` STOP-BANG '' screen questionnaire . There several additional research question pose observational prospective single-blinded clinical study determine OSA , define apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) , significant factor adverse event associate ambulatory orthopedic surgery . First , study sample size 600 select provide 82 % power detect significant difference unplanned admission patient OSA ( estimate 20 % surgical orthopedic population ) without OSA . This assume 10 % patient without OSA experience unplanned admission compare 20 % patient OSA . Other adverse perioperative event examine include difficult intubation , upper airway obstruction extubation , bronchospasm , laryngospasm , arrhythmia atrial fibrillation , need mechanical ventilation Additional question examine include surgery anesthesia , specific anesthetic technique , intraoperative sedative use , postoperative sedative use associate Home Sleep Test ( HST ) parameter ( AHI , Oxygen Desaturation Index ( ODI ) , pulse oximetry ( SpO2 ) nadir , percentage time SpO2 &lt; 90 % ) . Paired t-tests use perform analyse except question anesthetic technique analysis variance follow Tukey 's post-hoc multiple comparison employ . Lastly clinically relevant question address whether difference patient screen high risk OSA screen low risk OSA regard pre postoperative AHI , ODI , SpO2 nadir , percentage time SpO2 &lt; 90 % ? High- low-risk patient per screen instrument compare use t-tests independent sample . Ultimately understanding relationship surgical anesthesia OSA may use risk stratify patient , identify increase risk perioperative complication , potentially aid determine perioperative management plan .</detailed_description>
