	<brief_summary>Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) one difficult technique field GI endoscopy . It necessary trainee spend enough time perform enough case grasp technique . The method ERCP train include hands-on teaching , train different kind simulator , train ex-vivo live anesthetize porcine stomach model , etc . Supervised hands-on teach standard method ERCP training . Selective cannulation consider difficult challenge part learn ERCP . There optimal time trainee attempt cannulation hands-on ERCP training . The time use attempt cannulation trainee 5min 10min several center . In ERCP center investigator hospital , 15min use trainee attempt cannulation one year . The incidence post-ERCP pancreatitis , major complication relate cannulation , 4.0 % , comparable previous study . The investigator hypothesize long time ( 15min ) trainee attempt cannulation would increase success rate selective cannulation help improve skill quickly . At meantime , actively verbal hands-on assistance instructor performance trainee , risk complication would increase long time attempt cannulation . Here prospective , endoscopists-blinded , randomize , control study design evaluate effect different period time trainee attempt selective cannulation success rate cannulation , self-satisfaction performance post-ERCP pancreatitis .</brief_summary>
