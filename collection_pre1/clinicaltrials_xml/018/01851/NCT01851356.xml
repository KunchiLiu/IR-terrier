	<brief_summary>Background : - Studies show inflammation play important role depression . Brain inflammation may contribute depression , may make difficult treat kind depression current therapy . Researchers want use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan study inflammation brain . To , use contrast agent , chemical show inflammation image study . Objectives : - To see people major depressive disorder increase inflammation brain . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age major depressive disorder . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They provide blood sample scan session . - Participants PET scan screen visit . They dose contrast agent study . This scan look possible brain inflammation . - Participants also MRI scan . This scan take picture brain comparison study . - Treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Inflammation Major Depressive Disorder Background</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVE : Inflammation periphery brain may predispose factor major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . For example , MDD ( even absence medical illness ) often associate raise inflammatory marker , inflammatory medical illness associate great rate MDD . Moreover , patient treat cytokine various illness increase risk develop MDD . Translocator protein 18 kDa ( TSPO ) highly express protein inflammatory cell brain : activated microglia reactive astrocyte brain . TSPO , thereby , potential biomarker neuroinflammation . This protein accurately quantify use positron emission tomography ( PET ) [ C ( 11 ) ] PBR28 , TSPO tracer synthesize laboratory . The aim study ass whether subject MDD increase TSPO bind brain indirect marker neuroinflammation . STUDY POPULATION : This protocol study 40 patient MDD 30 healthy volunteer . We recruit 40 MDD subject achieve 30 completers . The remain 10 MMD subject include total - account subject sign consent ( therefore contribute accrual ceiling ) complete study variety reason . About half MDD subject take antidepressant medication half unmedicated . We exclude subject ( approximately 10 % population ) low affinity PBR28 ( non-binders ) , base blood test genotyping . All healthy volunteer must current serious medical condition . DESIGN For absolute quantification TSPO , MDD subject healthy control arterial blood sample concurrent PET image use 11C-PBR28 . We try minimize recruitment new healthy control rely historical database healthy control already scan [ C ( 11 ) ] PBR28 . OUTCOME MEASURES : To assess absolute quantitation TSPO 11C-PBR28 , primarily use distribution volume ( VT ) calculate compartmental modeling . As primary goal , compare VT value obtain MDD subject healthy control . As secondary goal , assess 1 ) effect medication treatment MDD patient 2 ) relationship CRP level TSPO bind MDD patient healthy subject .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : For healthy volunteer Age 18 old No serious current medical condition Able give write informed consent . No prior diagnosis drug alcohol dependence . For patient Age 18 old Able give write informed consent . Subjects meet DSMIV criterion recurrent MDD current major depressive episode . No prior diagnosis drug alcohol dependence . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : For healthy volunteer Any current Axis I diagnosis Clinically significant laboratory abnormality CRP . Subjects autoimmune disorder HIV positive Subjects current infection Recent peripheral injury Smoking last 6 month , smoking may cause inflammatory response Risk MRI scan , pacemaker implant electrical device , brain stimulators , type dental implant , aneurysm clip ( metal clip wall large artery ) , metallic prosthesis ( include metal pin rod , heart valve , cochlear implant ) , permanent eyeliner , implanted delivery pump , shrapnel fragment . Welders metal worker also risk injury possible small metal fragment eye may unaware . History neurologic illness injury potential affect study data interpretation . Recent exposure radiation ( i.e. , PET research ) combine study would allowable limit . Inability lie flat camera bed least two hour . Pregnancy breast feed . Able get pregnant use birth control . Non binder PBR28 determine blood test genotyping Positive urine drug screen day scan Subjects receiving treatment likely impact inflammation ( e.g. , chronic antinflammatory drug treatment ) , statins corticosteroid Significant MRI abnormalities brain . History seizure , childhood relate fever . A history drug alcohol abuse within 6 month history alcohol drug dependence ( except nicotine ) within 3 year ( DSMIV criterion ) For patient Previous radiation exposure ( Xrays , PET scan etc . ) , together study procedure , would exceed NIH RSC research limit . Claustrophobia degree subject would feel uncomfortable MRI machine . Can lie back least two hour . Smoking last 6 month , smoking may cause inflammatory response Brain abnormality brain tumor , stroke , brain damage head trauma blood vessel abnormality , MRI scan . Risk MRI scan , pacemaker implant electrical device , brain stimulators , type dental implant , aneurysm clip ( metal clip wall large artery ) , metallic prosthesis ( include metal pin rod , heart valve , cochlear implant ) , permanent eyeliner , implanted delivery pump , shrapnel fragment . Welders metal worker also risk injury possible small metal fragment eye may unaware . Subjects meet criterion bipolar disorder schizophrenia Current serious suicidal ideation ( e.g. , thought attempt suicide along intent plan attempt suicide ) recent suicidal behavior ( i.e. , suicide attempt within past six month ) Current psychosis Medical condition current medication likely influence cerebral function radiotracer delivery include cardiovascular , cerebrovascular , endocrine neurological diseases A history drug alcohol abuse within 6 month history alcohol drug dependence ( except nicotine ) within 3 year ( DSMIV criterion ) Current pregnancy breastfeed Able get pregnant use birth control Subjects autoimmune disorder Subjects current infection HIV positive Recent peripheral injury Subjects receiving treatment likely impact inflammation ( e.g. , chronic antinflammatory drug treatment ) , statins corticosteroid Subjects unable travel independently participate research study severity depression . Non binder PBR28 determine blood test genotyping Positive urine drug screen day scan .</criteria>
