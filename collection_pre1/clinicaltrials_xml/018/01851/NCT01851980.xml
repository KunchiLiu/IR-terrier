	<brief_summary>Breathlessness exertion common troublesome complaint individual restrictive lung disorder . In adult , breathlessness contributes physical activity-limitation avoidance adverse health-related quality-of-life , often self-perpetuating cycle . It follow alleviate dyspnea improve exercise tolerance among principal goal management adult restrictive lung disorder . Nevertheless , effective management breathlessness physical activity-limitation remain elusive goal many healthcare provider current therapy ( e.g. , antifibrotic agent , oxygen , exercise train ) partially successful regard . Thus , research aim identify breathlessness-specific medication complement exist therapy management physical activity-related breathlessness restrictive lung disorder timely clinically physiologically relevant . The purpose randomize crossover study study examine acute effect two dos inhale nebulized furosemide ( loop diuretic ) perception breathlessness laboratory-based cycle exercise healthy , young men presence external thoracic restriction mimic 'mild ' restrictive lung deficit . To end , investigator compare effect inhale 0.9 % saline placebo inhale furosemide ( 40 mg 120 mg ) detail assessment breathlessness ( sensory intensity affective response ) physiological determinant ( ventilation , breathe pattern , dynamic operating lung volume , cardio-metabolic function ) symptom-limited , high-intensity , constant-work-rate cycle exercise test external thoracic restriction sufficient mimic 'mild ' restrictive pulmonary deficit healthy , men age 18-40 year .</brief_summary>
