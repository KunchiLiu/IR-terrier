	<brief_summary>Epidural analgesia proven effective method severe pain relief associate labor delivery . During labor , low dose continuous infusion local anesthetic narcotic administer epidural catheter . As labor progress baby 's head make way pelvis , breakthrough pain may emerge often need treatment . The investigator provide pain relief administer analgesic epidural catheter . The patient randomly assign receive one two medication mixture believe successful treat type pain associate advanced labor . After initial treatment , pain relief attain , patient may receive medication well . The medication use study use institution time find safe mother baby . The opioid ( fentanyl ) dose small small fraction transmit baby . The medication ( clonidine ) good know blood pressure medication also use pain relief . Studies clinical experience show clonidine give epidurally dos use study minimal , effect , blood pressure mother baby . The investigator record medical obstetric history labor progress relevant patient . The patient ask question regard labor pain side effect analgesic administer . The primary objective determine treatment regimen successful abolish breakthrough pain advance labor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Epidural analgesia popular choice among patient relief severe pain associate labor delivery . Currently , investigator ' institution investigator use continuous infusion low dose local anesthetic narcotic ( 12 ml/hr 0.0625 % bupivacaine 2 micrograms/ml fentanyl ) initial spinal epidural dose maintain patient comfort delivery . This dose infusion chosen often provide adequate comfort without interfere mobility patient ability effectively push delivery . However , low-dose epidural infusion strategy often result recurrence pain initial pain-free period . This recur pain know breakthrough pain alleviate administer small bolus analgesic via epidural catheter . The pain occur labor initially visceral origin mediate pain fiber originate low thoracic upper lumbar segment spinal cord . As labor progress late first phase ( also know transitional stage ) , pain sensation originate distension pelvic floor , vagina perineum add somatic component labor pain . This type breakthrough pain , mediate nerve fiber originate sacral nerve dermatomes S2-S4 , often difficult treat . Patients may experience inadequate analgesia even boluses analgesic administer . Inadequate analgesia deleterious due subjective discomfort associate neurohumoral physiological change , initiator urge bear ( push ) . Pushing complete dilation cervix may lead swell , cervical injury premature exhaustion mother . Adequate pain control allow cervix fully dilate motivate mother push effectively appropriate time . Although request patient alleviate late stage breakthrough pain common , establish data literature regard effective strategy pain management stage labor . This study design compare efficacy two treatment control late first stage breakthrough pain labor : clonidine-bupivacaine versus fentanyl-bupivacaine . Both strategy use Columbia University Medical Center ( CUMC ) clinical situation , clear evidence whether one superior .</detailed_description>
