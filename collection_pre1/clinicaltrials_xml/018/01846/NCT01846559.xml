	<brief_summary>Platelets main type blood cell involve formation blood clot cause heart attack . The investigator give antiplatelet drug ( aspirin , example ) reduce risk another clot form future cause another heart attack . Platelets know role inflammation infection well clot . In recent large clinical trial , know PLATO study , also show patient treat new antiplatelet medication ( ticagrelor ) develop few lung infection , well few heart attack , compare current standard treatment ( clopidogrel ) . The investigator would therefore like investigate reason behind look effect medication immune response . This may help u develop new drug well effect immune response . The investigator plan clinical trial investigates effect medication immune response healthy volunteer age 18 65 . Only volunteer significant past medical history take medication include . Thirty volunteer receive either normal dose ticagrelor clopidogrel antiplatelet medication 1 week . They attend Sheffield Clinical Research Facility immune response stimulate use safe , well establish method . The investigator injection low dose endotoxin , part surface coat bacteria use extensively similar study , thousand volunteer past 20 year investigate immune response . It known cause temporary flu-like symptom last approximately 68 hour . The investigator take measurement inflammatory marker , white blood cell function platelet function compare effect ticagrelor clopidogrel immune response .</brief_summary>
