	<brief_summary>Investigators recently complete pilot study explore safety efficacy use virtual-reality base cue platform elicit crave smoker schizophrenia ( SWS ) ( Wehring et al , unpublished ) . In study , participant schizophrenia ( n=16 ) show increase attention cigarette change crave measure participate VR crave platform . In addition , participant tolerate VR environment without undue adverse effect exacerbation symptom . Adverse effect VR environment differ non-mentally ill population , include headache , nausea , dizziness commonly occur factor . Persons pilot also show acceptable rate Immersion Presence VR environment , show potential use form environment purpose . In study , investigator examine virtual reality cue-reactivity smoker schizophrenia , focus relationship cue-reactivity self-identified triggers/cues . Smokers schizophrenia often identify specific cue trigger crave . Many environmental ( scent , sight smoking paraphernalia cigarette , related object , social situation ) , however , significant amount smoker describe emotionally-based factor ( sadness , upset , etc . ) primary cue trigger . Most method use elicit crave experimental study execute via use environmental cue like sight cigarette smoke paraphernalia . It known smoker schizophrenia ( SWS ) strongly emotionally trigger responsive environmental trigger cue-elicited crave platform . This important research question , test anti-craving intervention generalizable use across SWS differ trigger smoke . The VR-based environmental program pilot study , include sight , scent , social cue , use test pre-identified environmental cues/triggers effect cue-elicited crave 30 SWS . Subjective report , mood emotion measure , objective physiological measurement use identify quantify environmental crave responsivity well tonic craving . Given high prevalence smoking among individual schizophrenia , understanding environmental factor serve maintain nicotine dependence critical step improve smoke cessation treatment outcome . Establishing validate model cue-elicited responsivity allow future investigation crave , ultimately design study efficacy anti-craving medication people schizophrenia .</brief_summary>
