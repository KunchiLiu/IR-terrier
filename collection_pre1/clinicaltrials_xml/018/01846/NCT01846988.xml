	<brief_summary>The purpose research study determine auto-adjustable positive airway pressure ( APAP ) effective way treat obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) child . APAP device similar continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) deliver pressure upper airway ( nose throat ) keep airway collapse sleep . The difference APAP adjust pressure throughout night change resistance breathing , CPAP give amount pressure whole time worn . APAP currently widely use treat adult OSA , however , device yet extensively studied child . There two part research study . Subjects begin use APAP time enrollment 4 8 week . The investigator compare pressure measure APAP device 4-8 week pressure determine CPAP titration study . The titration study second overnight sleep study routinely order child sleep apnea start treatment CPAP . It tell doctor CPAP setting use . In second part study The investigator compare effect APAP CPAP see report comfortable used hour sleep . This part study last 8 week subject use CPAP APAP 4 week . Currently someone diagnose OSA delay start treatment CPAP result titration study available . In research , patient could allow immediately start treatment APAP . If APAP find safe effective regular CPAP , treatment APAP could use alternative CPAP .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing Auto-adjustable Positive Airway Pressure Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Children With Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This small clinical trial test feasibility use APAP child sleep apnea . Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) commonly use treat OSA delivering predetermine amount positive pressure patient 's upper airway order reduce collapsibility airway structure sleep . The commonly accepted method determine appropriate pressure set child OSA in-hospital overnight CPAP titration study . Another commonly use treatment modality adult OSA auto-adjustable positive airway pressure ( APAP ) , airway patency maintain adjusting pressure delivery night depend need patient determined device . Benefits APAP compare CPAP include ability initiate therapy without inpatient CPAP titration study , result prompt establishment treatment cost-savings . Patient adherence may also significantly improve pressure deliver appropriate sleep stage patient position , result great patient comfort . Utility efficacy APAP compare CPAP never evaluate pediatric population . The aim study establish APAP effective mean assess CPAP pressure OSA child , determine APAP therapy confers well treatment adherence quality life compare traditional CPAP . The investigator hypothesize APAP effectively approximate pressure determine CPAP titration study , APAP superior fix CPAP term treatment success , adherence therapy improve APAP compare CPAP . Forty patient age 5-20 year enrol study . These subject recruit pediatric pulmonary pediatric sleep clinic Cincinnati Children 's Hospital . Patients suspect OSA refer usual manner sleep center diagnostic sleep study ( PSG ) . Following establishment OSA diagnosis subsequent enrollment study , subject begin therapy APAP continue 4 8 week . In period time clinically order in-hospital CPAP titration study complete . The subject randomize either traditional fixed pressure CPAP pressure determine in-hospital titration APAP . The subject receive 4 week treatment randomize group ( CPAP APAP ) crossover 4 week alternate group ( CPAP APAP ) . Both patient researcher blind randomization pressure modality . The total study period range 12-16 week .</detailed_description>
