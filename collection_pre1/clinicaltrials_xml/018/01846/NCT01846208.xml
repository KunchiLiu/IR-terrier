	<brief_title>Baked Egg Egg Oral Immunotherapy Children With Egg Allergy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Food allergy affect 6-8 percent child United States . In young child , reaction egg range hive severe life threaten allergic reaction call anaphylaxis . Current treatment food allergy complete avoidance food carry antihistamines self-injectable epinephrine accidental reaction occurs . However , accidental exposure allergen process food may difficult avoid . Currently , several therapeutic strategy investigate prevent treat food allergy . Since immunotherapy injection food allergy associate high rate allergic reaction , alternate approach treatment need . Oral ( mouth ) immunotherapy ( OIT ) one approach try study treatment food allergy . The purpose study compare bake food egg versus ( vs. ) egg OIT . The intent study investigate participant able consume egg take bake food egg egg OIT period time stop certain period . This refer tolerance sustain unresponsiveness . This study evaluate effectiveness egg OIT vs. bake egg participant ingest egg white solid bake food egg . This do 2 year . This study last 2 year . All eligible subject receive bake egg oral food challenge ( OFC ) . Those pas bake egg OFC 2 gm egg OFC . Those react egg OFC randomize Baked Egg Egg OIT . Individuals pass initial baked egg OFC assign Egg OIT . Those pass egg OFC eligible study follow per site standard care . All eligible enrolled subject 1-year 2-year OFC . At select visit , blood urine collection , physical examination , prick skin test , atopic dermatitis asthma evaluation occur .</detailed_description>
