	<brief_title>Viral Therapy In Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Squamous Cell Carcinoma Head Neck Cancer Metastatic Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximally tolerate dose ( MTD ) intratumoral administration Edmonston strain measles virus genetically engineer express human thyroidal sodium-iodide symporter ( NIS ) ( oncolytic measles virus encode thyroidal sodium iodide symporter [ MV-NIS ] ) patient recurrent/metastatic squamous cell head neck cancer . II . To determine safety toxicity intratumoral administration MV-NIS patient recurrent/metastatic squamous cell head neck cancer metastatic breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess preliminary fashion antitumor efficacy approach follow , radiographic response , time progression . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine time course viral gene expression virus elimination biodistribution virally infected cell various time point infection MV-NIS use single-photon emission compute tomography ( SPECT ) /computed tomography ( CT ) imaging . II . To assess viremia , viral replication , measles virus shedding/persistence follow intratumoral administration . III . To determine humoral cellular immune response inject virus . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive oncolytic measles virus encode thyroidal sodium iodide symporter intratumorally ( IT ) day 1 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 6 week , every 3 month 1 year , every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
