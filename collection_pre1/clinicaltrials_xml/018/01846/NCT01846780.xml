	<brief_summary>Patients unilateral post-thrombotic obstruction iliac tract common femoral vein , eligible stenting include . Intravenous pressure measure dorsal foot vein common femoral vein . Patients ask undergo standardise treadmill test ( 3.2km/h , 0 % slope increase 2 % /2min , maximum walking time 26 min ) . Painfree maximum action radius note .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treadmill Pilot Study ( Invasive Pressure Measurements PTS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : PTA &amp; stenting iliofemoral iliocaval venous obstruction proven effective method treatment good clinical result . However , proper investigation make objectify reduction ( ambulatory ) venous hypertension cause type obstruction . Normal ambulatory venous pressure 20mmHg , though study already show linear relationship incidence ulcer ambulatory intravenous pressure 30mmHg . We believe measure ( ambulatory ) venous pressure stenting , gain knowledge hemodynamics venous disease treatment obtain information might identify patient risk stent occlusion form ulcer early stage . Identifying patient certainly influence preventive treatment future . Objective : To map change intravenous pressure post-thrombotic iliofemoral venous obstruction evaluate effect PTA &amp; stenting possible identification predictive parameter success treatment . Study design : Prospective , observational study ( healthy diseased limb one patient ) . Study population : Patients iliofemoral venous obstruction , objectify duplex ultrasonography magnetic resonance venography , indication stenting obstruct tract ( ) . Intervention : All patient undergo stenting obstruct venous tract . Patients receive therapy would receive participate study ; therefore study influence treatment patient receive . Main study parameters/endpoints : Primary outcome change ( ambulatory ) venous pressure stenting deep venous obstructive disease . Other important endpoint absolute value intravenous pressure , pain free walking distance maximum walking distance . Additional outcome measurement stent patency , CEAP score , Villalta score , venous clinical severity score , generic disease specific quality life score . Finally , transverse surface area , diameter circumference common femoral vein measure . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Patients make three visit . Each visit take approximately two hour . During test day , patient undergo intravenous pressure measurement dorsal foot vein , common femoral vein vein leave upper arm , measure via venflon needle microsheath ( place ultrasound guidance ) connect pressure transducer ; treadmill test last maximally 26 minute ; air plethysmography , need undergo anyway ; duplex ultrasound ass common femoral vein . This low risk study , since diagnostic tool use also use usual clinical practice give low risk mild complication . Patients experience pain due insertion removal venflons/microsheaths , due compression groin removal microsheaths due walk treadmill ( venous claudication ) . Amendment : iv arm vein control perform anymore . An abdominbal wall collateral cannulate instead , present .</detailed_description>
