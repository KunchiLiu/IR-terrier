	<detailed_description>This prospective study design examine role bacterial overgrowth delay intestinal transit effect Rifaximin hepatic encephalopathy ( HE ) . This study divide Phase A Phase B . The purpose Phase A test patient cirrhosis determine bacterial overgrowth may lead slow intestinal transit hepatic encephalopathy . The purpose Phase B investigate whether improvement find patient hepatic encephalopathy take Rifaximin also relate decreased bacterial overgrowth . The target population patient chronic liver cirrhosis without symptom HE . Many patient may present advanced cirrhosis may liver transplant list . During Phase A , 20 patient ask sign inform consent form assign subject number . They ask provide demographic information , medical history , history hospitalization HE , HE medication use . They undergo complete physical examination , urine pregnancy test ( woman childbearing potential ) , 12-lead EKG , grade ascites , modify Child Pugh Score , MELD Score . They also complete follow neuropsychological questionnaire : NCT , D-KEFS Trail Making Test , California Verbal Learning Test , WAIS-III Digit Symbol-Coding Block Design , D-KEFS Stroop Color-Word Test , Evaluation Constructional Apraxia , , asterixis . During evaluation visit ( minimum 3 day Screening Visit ) follow procedure perform : lab test ( chemistry hematology panel ) . They also complete follow questionnaire : Liver Disease Quality Life Questionnaire , Fisk Fatigue Impact Score , Flatulence Survey , Epworth Sleepiness Scale . Finally , undergo Lactulose Hydrogen Breath Test : This test design evaluate intestinal transit bacterial overgrowth . Participants Phase B administer 550 mg Rifaximin two time day 14 day . Patients scheduled come day 14 active study period . The follow visit day 28 , test describe repeat . During Phase B , patient ask undergo complete physical examination , Neurological Examination [ include calculation modify Child Pugh MELD Score NCT , Trail Making Test ] , evaluation constructional apraxia asterixis . In addition , researcher make sure patient meet eligibility criterion participation open label trial Rifaximin . They administer first dose study drug ( Rifaximin ) study coordinator investigator dispense study drug need remainder trial diary record daily flatulence . A urine pregnancy test perform within 48 hour first study dose ( woman childbearing potential ) . During Day 14 Day 28 visit , patient 1 tablespoon blood drawn measurement ammonia level monitor potential blood clot . They complete NCT , Trails Test , Digit Symbol-Coding , Block Design , Stroop Tests . They also complete Liver Disease Quality Life Questionnaire , Fisk Fatigue Impact Score , Flatulence Survey ( A diary provide patient instruction record flatulence experience daily basis ) , Epworth Sleepiness Scale questionnaire . In addition , Day 14 , undergo another Lactulose Hydrogen Breath Test . Subjects ' mental capacity assess visit via interview , brief mental status , questionnaires psychometric evaluation . Any subject appear lose capacity continue participation , evidence HE grade 2 high , lack attentiveness , concentration , understanding evaluation , discontinue study . Female subject childbearing potential ask comply use contraception Phase B study period well throughout time remain study drug . Following completion study , patient categorize degree HE . To determine whether impaired intestinal transit bacterial overgrowth associate severity HE , multivariate analysis perform determine whether independent factor liver disease severity , intestinal transit , bacterial overgrowth significant predictor presence severity HE . Also , determine whether treatment Rifaximin improve bacterial overgrowth , ammonia level , HE , change Breath Test analysis correlate correlated change ammonia level HE .</detailed_description>
