	<detailed_description>If willing participate study , ask undergo screening test procedure confirm eligible . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn taht take part research study . If test procedure recently , may may repeat . The screen process may include follow : medical history , mini-mental status exam , physical exam , performance status , electrocardiogram , blood test , urine test . If test show eligible participate research study , begin study treatment . If meet eligibility criterion , able participate research study . If take part research study , give study drug-dosing calendar treatment cycle . Each treatment cycle last 28 day ( 4 week ) time take study drug daily 3 week study drug last week cycle . The diary also include special instruction take study drug . During cycle physical exam ask question general health specific question problem might medication may take . Standard contrast-enhanced ( CE ) MRI scan do prior odd-numbered study cycle . Vascular MRI scan do prior start treatment , Day 1 treatment prior even-numbered cycle . These study do Charlestown Navy Yard . We would like keep track medical condition 24 month last dose study treatment . We would like call telephone year see . Keeping touch checking condition every year help u look long-term effect research study .</detailed_description>
