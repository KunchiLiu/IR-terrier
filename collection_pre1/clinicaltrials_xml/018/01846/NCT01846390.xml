	<brief_summary>This research do yet know dose romidepsin combination gemcitabine , dexamethasone , cisplatin ( GDP ) give safely patient peripheral T-cell lymphoma , type severity side effect result combination treatment . This research also do clear addition new drug romidepsin treatment GDP offer good result longer survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Romidepsin , Gemcitabine , Dexamethasone Cisplatin Treatment Peripheral T-Cell Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study find high dose romidepsin safely give combination gemcitabine , dexamethasone , cisplatin ( GDP ) without cause severe side effect tolerable . This do start dose low one cause side effect animal . Patients give romidepsin GDP watch closely see side effect make sure side effect severe . If side effect severe , patient ask join study give high dose romidepsin ( GDP ) . Patients join study later get high dos romidepsin ( GDP ) patient join earlier . This continue dose find cause severe temporary side effect . Doses high give .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients histologically confirm PTCL . Biopsy proof disease initial diagnosis mandatory . A biopsy relapse preferred mandatory . Patients must receive one two previous regimen therapy disease ( salvage chemotherapy plus autologous stem cell transplantation consider one regimen ) . Clinically / radiologically measurable disease ( 1 site bidimensionally measurable ) . Measurements / evaluation must do within 28 day prior registration . Age 18 75 year . ECOG performance status 0 , 1 2 . Life expectancy ≥ 90 day ( 3 month ) . Laboratory Requirements : ( must do within 7 day registration ) Hematology : Granulocytes ( AGC ) ≥ 1.0 x 10^9/L Platelets ≥ 75 x 10^9/L ( ≥ 50 bone marrow involvement lymphoma ) Biochemistry : AST ALT ≤ 2.5x ULN ( ≤ 5x ULN hepatic involvement disease ) Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x ULN ( ≤ 3x ULN hepatic involvement disease , ≤5x ULN Gilberts Disease ) Serum Potassium ≥ 3.8 mmol/L* Serum Magnesium ≥ 0.85 mmol/L* * NB : Patients potassium magnesium level value eligible supplementation correct deficit . This supplementation continue throughout course study . Calculated creatinine clearance ( CockcroftGault formula ) ≥ 50 mL /min . Women must postmenopausal , surgically sterile use reliable form contraception study 90 day discontinue therapy . Women childbearing potential must pregnancy test take proven negative within 7 day prior registration must lactate . Patient consent must obtain accord local Institutional and/or University Human Experimentation Committee requirement . Patients must accessible treatment followup . Patients register trial must treat follow participate centre . This imply must reasonable geographical limit ( example : 1 ½ hour 's driving distance ) place patient consider trial . In accordance NCIC CTG policy , protocol treatment begin within 2 work day patient registration . Patients history malignancy , except : adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer superficial bladder cancer , curatively treated insitu cancer cervix breast localize excised prostate cancer , solid tumour curatively treat evidence disease ≥ 3 year . Central nervous system involvement , meningeal parenchymal . Patients CNS disease initial presentation CNS CR time relapse eligible . MRI scan / lumbar puncture perform clinical suspicion active CNS disease . HIV , active hepatitis B current hepatitis C infection . ( Hepatitis B core antibody positive , surface antigen negative patient allow concurrent antiviral prophylaxis administer . Patients past history hepatitis C eradicate virus eligible . ) Any serious active disease comorbid medical condition , laboratory abnormality , psychiatric illness would prevent patient participating ( accord investigator 's decision ) . Patients serious cardiac illness condition include , limited : history document congestive heart failure ( CHF ) systolic dysfunction ( LVEF &lt; 45 % MUGA ECHO ) high risk uncontrolled arrhythmia ( ventricular tachycardia , highgrade AVblock , supraventricular arrhythmia adequately ratecontrolled ) unstable angina pectoris require antianginal medication clinically significant valvular heart disease evidence transmural infarction ECG New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV functional status patient congenital long QT syndrome , history significant cardiovascular disease and/or take drug lead significant QT prolongation patient QTc &gt; 480 msec eligible Pregnant lactating female woman childbearing potential willing use adequate method birth control duration study .
