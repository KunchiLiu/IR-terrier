	<brief_title>A Study Comparing Combination Trabectedin ( YONDELIS ) DOXIL/CAELYX With DOXIL/CAELYX Treatment Advanced-Relapsed Epithelial Ovarian , Primary Peritoneal , Fallopian Tube Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize ( individual assign study treatment chance ) , open - label ( identity assign study drug know ) , active - control study adult female patient platinum-sensitive advanced - relapse epithelial ovarian , primary peritoneal , fallopian tube cancer receive 2 previous line platinum - base chemotherapy . Approximately 670 participant enrol . Patients stratify 4 criterion define protocol randomly assign 1:1 ratio trabectedin+DOXIL combination therapy group ( Arm A ) DOXIL ( pegylated liposomal doxorubicin ) monotherapy group ( Arm B ) . During treatment phase , patient receive study drug infusion accord 21 - day cycle Arm A 28 - day cycle Arm B . Treatment continue occurrence disease progression unacceptable treatment toxicity , 2 cycle assessment complete response ( CR ) . Efficacy assessment evaluate use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors . Disease assessment , include assessment patient discontinue treatment reason disease progression , perform disease progression , start subsequent anticancer therapy , withdrawal consent , clinical cutoff date . Collection survival status continue least 514 death observe . Serial pharmacokinetic ( PK ) sample collect subset patient voluntarily consent PK portion study . Safety monitor throughout study . An interim analysis overall survival ( OS ) perform approximately 308 participant die . The final analysis OS occur approximately 514 death observe .</detailed_description>
