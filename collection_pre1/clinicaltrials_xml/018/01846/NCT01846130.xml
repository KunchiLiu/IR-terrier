	<brief_summary>The loss muscle mass function old adult bed rest facilitate defect regulation muscle protein metabolism , include impaired ability mount anabolic response mixed nutrient meal . The investigator propose low-intensity exercise supplement daily meal leucine whey independently synergistically reduce deleterious effect inactivity skeletal muscle facilitate recovery rehabilitation . Metabolic measure include : ) nutrient exercise-specific marker translation initiation ; b ) skeletal muscle protein synthesis ; c ) novel breath test glucose tolerance . Morphologic functional measure include : ) muscle mass body composition ; b ) muscle strength function ; c ) motor activation . The investigator test follow hypothesis old men woman ( 65-80 year ) 7 day bed rest follow 7 day inpatient rehabilitation : 1 . Inactivity-induced metabolic dysregulation blunt anabolic response meal , facilitate loss lean muscle mass , glucose tolerance functional capacity partially restore rehabilitation . 2 . Supplementing daily meal leucine whey maintain nutrient-stimulated translation initiation preserve anabolic response meal ingestion . This partially preserve lean muscle mass function bed rest facilitate recovery functional metabolic capacity rehabilitation . 3 . Daily low-intensity exercise preserve motor unit activation , stimulate exercise-regulated signal pathway normalize anabolic response meal ingestion . This partially preserve glucose tolerance , lean muscle mass function bed rest facilitate rehabilitation . 4 . Leucine whey-supplemented meal combine low-intensity exercise effective stimulus either intervention alone , preserve glucose tolerance , lean muscle mass function bed rest facilitating great increase functional metabolic capacity rehabilitation . This translational project provide mechanistic practical insight strategy reduce negative consequence physical inactivity promote rehabilitation age muscle . Our novel , minimally invasive clinically intervention direct application old hospitalize patient risk accelerate muscle loss diminish functional capacity .</brief_summary>
