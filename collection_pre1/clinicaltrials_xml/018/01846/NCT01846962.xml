	<brief_summary>Therapeutic strategy eosinophilic esophagitis ( EoE ) actually include : 1 ) allergen avoidance dietary modification , 2 ) pharmacologic antiinflammatory therapy . Medical treatment mainly base topical administration corticosteroid swallow fluticasone propionate budesonide spray . Dietetic treatment high efficacy elemental diet , consist exclusive feed amino-acid base formula , often administer trough SNG . Alternative choice acceptable efficacy empirical six-foods elimination diet ( cow 's milk , egg , soy , wheat , peanut , fish ) target elimination diet base result allergy test . Most paediatric patient EE respond elemental target elimination diet , therefore author recommend elimination diet consider treatment choice child . However , elimination diet often complex follow may associate poor adherence owe low palatability highly restrict diet . In non-compliant patient , especially adolescent young adult , may practical proceed first corticosteroid treatment . In case partial response elimination diet corticosteroid , combination treatment mod . However , limited test regimen randomize controlled trial , available literature base case series . The aim study compare efficacy six-foods elimination diet versus swallow fluticasone versus budesonide pediatric patient active EoE . The investigator assess effect randomly assign treatment clinical endoscopic/histologic severity primary secondary outcome , respectively . In addiction , assess efficacy combine therapy ( diet plus topical steroid ) administer non respond patient . The investigator describe clinical , allergological , endoscopic histological feature , pH study result , pediatric population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Eosinophilic esophagitis ( EoE ) characterize significant eosinophilic infiltration esophageal mucosa , lead tissue damage consequently esophageal symptom . The clinical presentation childhood often mimic gastro-esophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) , sometimes association feed difficulty failure thrive . Later life , common symptom dysphagia food impaction , due esophageal dysmotility . The progression non-recognized , untreated disease , think lead chronic esophageal inflammation fibrosis stenosis . Diagnosis require multiple esophageal biopsy ( least 4 proximal distal esophagus , regardless gross appearance mucosa ) demonstrate mucosal infiltrate least 15 eosinophil high power field ( HPF ) patient normal pH study refractory acid-suppression therapy . Although endoscopic examination may unremarkable , endoscopic feature EoE well characterize include : linear furrowing , concentric ring ( thachealization ) , white spot ( eosinophilic abscess ) , Schatzki ring , stricture , linear superficial mucosal tear occur introduction endoscope .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>suspect , previously diagnose , EoE phase clinical activity . Diagnostic criterion : 1. suggestive esophageal symptom ( GERDlike disease , dysphagia , food impaction ) ; 2. negative 24 hour pHimpedenzometric study , whether positive , refractoriness high dose proton pump inhibitor ( PPI ) therapy least 8 week ; 3. histological demonstration &gt; 15/20 eosinophils/HPF least 1 esophageal biopsy . Patients receive dietetic antiinflammatory treatment last 6 month drop , allergy therapy allow study diagnosis concomitant inflammatory , rheumatic infectious disease , assumption dietetic therapy since clinical onset .</criteria>
