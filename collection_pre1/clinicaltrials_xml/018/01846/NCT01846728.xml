	<brief_title>Effects Estrogen Deficiency Energy Expenditure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate role female sex hormone estrogen , metabolism , thermoregulation energy expenditure . Weight fat gain increase menopause , reason clear . Loss estrogen may cause change woman regulate metabolism thermoregulation , possibly lead weight gain . Specifically , study determine loss estrogen affect facultative thermogenesis . Loosely defined , facultative thermogenesis represent heat production turn need . For example , body core temperature fall certain threshold , shiver response invoke skeletal muscle increase heat production , thus , energy expenditure . However , exposure several hour mild cold temperature trigger shiver ( 16-20‚Å∞ C ) also induce increase energy expenditure ( cold-induced non-shivering thermogenesis ) . Although several different tissue may contribute response , recent identification functional brown adipose tissue ( BAT ) human promote interest BAT activate human potential role regulate energy balance body weight . The investigator measure BAT activity use PET/CT scan pre post three month estrogen suppression .</detailed_description>
