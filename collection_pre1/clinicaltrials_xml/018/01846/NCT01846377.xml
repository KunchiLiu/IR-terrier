	<brief_summary>With increase rate child obesity diabetes , innovative program need capture child 's attention permit behavior change message get . Serious video game immersive story offer one promising alternative due low cost approach intervention since game already develop , broadly disseminate simply reproduce distribute DVDs . While use video game health promotion controversial , study establish whether video game effectively change diabetes obesity risk ( especially fast insulin , diet physical activity ) among child . `` Escape Diab '' `` Nanoswarm : Invasion Inner Space '' two video game target child increase fruit , vegetable water intake , reduce sedentary behavior ( SB ) , increase physical activity pilot study relatively low risk child . In light , important test whether game help decrease diabetes ( i.e . fast insulin ) obesity risk high risk ( 85 % tile &lt; BMI &lt; 99 % tile ) 10 12 year old child . Children randomly assign treatment control group . The treatment group play `` Diab '' `` Nano '' 3-month time period . A wait-list control group receive `` Diab '' `` Nano '' game end second post assessment ( 5-months post baseline assessment ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This project conduct efficacy trial Diab Nanoswarm ass potential minimize T2D obesity risk . The propose research conduct two phase , cover 3-year period : implementation evaluation phase 2.5 year analysis phase 0.5 year . Specific Aim 1 : Conduct efficacy outcome evaluation Diab Nano use randomized clinical trial . Hypothesis 1 : Children decrease fast insulin , least , 2Î¼U/dl , increase FV intake least 1.0 servings/day , increase MVPA least 10 min/day baseline 3 month post baseline . Hypothesis 2 : Diet , MVPA fast insulin change moderate demographic characteristic ( e.g . gender , age , ethnic group ) . Hypothesis 3 : Fasting insulin change mediate change diet , PA SB . Hypothesis 4 : Diet PA change outcomes mediate change child 's preference intrinsic motivation FV PA. Control Intervention wait list group receive intervention end 5-month post assessment . Intervention : Children play game home . Each game session take 45 60 minute complete ability go back replay non-behavior mini-games . Child Measures include : - Fasting insulin glucose - Height , weight waist circumference - Body mass index ( BMI ; kg/m2 ) BMI % - Fruit , vegetable beverage intake food frequency , preference , self efficacy , intrinsic motivation - Physical activity ( PA ) Actigraph GT3X accelerometer PA preferences/enjoyment , self efficacy , intrinsic motivation home equipment availability - Transportation/immersion/liking video game play - Social desirability reflect give answer socially acceptable expect Parent Measures include : - Family demographic - Food physical activity equipment availability home - Report child like played video game</detailed_description>
