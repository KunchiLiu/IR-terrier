	<detailed_description>At least 1 4 700,000 U.S. Veterans serve 1990-1991 Gulf War suffer Gulf War Illness ( GWI ) . Despite considerable research , effective treatment remain elusive . GWI refers complex symptom typically include widespread chronic pain , persistent headache , memory concentration problem , gastrointestinal difficulty , sleep disturbance unexplained fatigue . This symptom profile similar fibromyalgia syndrome ( FMS ) , multi-symptom condition similar GWI . Whereas , effective treatment GWI yet find , progress make identify medication treat FMS . For example , FDA approve number medication include Duloxetine Pregabalin treatment FMS . Compared placebo ( PBO ) Duloxetine ( serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor ) Pregabalin ( alpha-2-alpha-subunit calcium-channel ligand ) significantly improve pain response fatigue . The capacity Duloxetine increase central level serotonin norepinephrine well complex alteration neurotransmitter central nervous system ( CNS ) mediator pain attributed pregabalin think responsible medication 's effect pain , mood sleep . Clinical practice one open-label trial support use medication combination achieve optimal symptom improvement amongst GWI sufferer ; however , combination formally test randomize controlled trial . The lack progress find effective treatment GWI , similarities GWI FMS , provide rationale determine FDA approve medication provide significant symptomatic relief Veterans suffer GWI . Central Texas home one high number Gulf War Veterans nation , thus investigator ' research team ideally situate conduct propose study . In randomized , double-blind , controlled trial , 180 Veterans meet define criterion GWI whose symptom profile include chronic widespread pain sleep disturbance treat one follow medication ; 1 ) AM Duloxetine+ PM placebo ( PBO ) ; 2 ) PM Pregabalin + AM PBO 3 ) AM PBO + PM PBO . All active treatment titrate low dose 2-week increment full therapeutic dos ( FDA-approved FMS ) . The outcome PBO double-dummy period compare statistically 18 week active therapy ( week 5-22 ) .</detailed_description>
