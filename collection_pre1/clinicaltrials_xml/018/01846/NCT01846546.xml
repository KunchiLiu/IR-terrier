	<brief_summary>Angiogenesis important pathophysiological response traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) modulate pro- anti-angiogenic factor . Recent study suggest endogenous angiogenesis inhibitor endostatin/collagen XVIII might play important role secondary brain injury follow TBI . The aim study investigate early change concentration CSF endostatin/collagen XVIII TBI evaluate relation endostatin/collagen XVIII injury severity clinical outcome . Endostatin/collagen XVIII concentration measure serially 1 week hospitalization use enzyme link immunosorbent assay method cerebrospinal fluid 30 patient TBI Glasgow Coma Scale score 8 less admission . Comparative analysis use determine serial change correlate GCS score prognosis . Receiver operate characteristic curve use appraise value CSF endostatin/collagen XVIII level predict prognosis patient severe head injury .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cerebrospinal Fluid Endostatin/Collagen XVIII Concentrations Patients With Severe Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients severe TBI ( Glasgow Coma Scale score 8 less ) require continuous lumbar drainage CSF include study . Patients deliver within 4 h whose high abbreviated injury score 3 less ( head injury ) consider isolated TBI case include . To avoid interfere factor , patient suffer open combined injury , exist prior neurological disease exclude . Those die within first week hospitalization and/or whose serial cerebrospinal fluid sample could obtain also excluded incomplete data . Accordingly , 30 patient analyze study . Demographic data , include age , gender , mechanism trauma GCS score admission document patient arrived emergency room . The control group comprise 20 patient whose cerebrospinal fluid examine via lumbar puncture investigation suspect neurological disease . All patient normal neurological examination , negative imaging study , none evidence trauma preexist neurological disease , include tumor , vascular anomaly , abnormality cerebrospinal fluid . The study approval hospital ethic committee inform consent participate study obtain appropriate member patient 's family performance lumbar drainage .</detailed_description>
