	<criteria>Histologically cytologically proven highrisk advance solid malignancy include melanoma , colorectal cancer , ovarian cancer , breast cancer , non smallcell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) meet one follow criterion : Melanoma : For Arms A B : Stage IIIBIV melanoma render clinically free disease surgery , therapy , spontaneous remission For Arm C : Stage IIAIV melanoma render clinically free disease surgery , therapy , spontaneous remission For Arms : Stage III IV melanoma disease , patient fail approved therapy , candidate approve therapy , refuse approve therapy . Staging base 7th edition AJCC stag system melanoma cancer . Staging mucosal melanoma base follow system modify cutaneous melanoma stag system : IIA : 2.01 4mm primary , stage IIB : &gt; 4mm primary , lymph node metastasis = stage III , distant metastasis = stage IV . Breast cancer : Metastatic stage IV unresectable breast cancer endocrine therapy systemic therapy least one prior therapy metastatic disease . Patients metastatic , measurable disease eligible . Participation study preclude delivery approve appropriate anticancer therapy , deliver concurrent trial , except patient may participate take endocrineonly therapy ( eg : aromatase inhibitor tamoxifen Lupron ) . Patients may also participate preplanned chemotherapy holiday . Patients resection stage IIIA IV breast cancer ( ER , PR , Her2 status ) surgery , radiation therapy , adjuvant chemotherapy , HER2 target therapy . For Arm C : Stage III , high risk patient either triple negative breast cancer HER2 positive disease also eligible tumor large 1 cm . Vaccine offer surgery , radiation therapy adjuvant chemotherapy ( indicate ) Colorectal cancer : Metastatic ( advance ) colorectal cancer fail least 2 prior chemotherapy regimen , include 5FU , ironotecan , oxaliplatin . Highrisk resect metastatic colorectal cancer resection liver metastases approved agent administer . For patient surgical resection liver metastasis , Eligibility Arms A B limit least 3 follow risk factor : nodepositive primary , diseasefree interval less 1 year , 1 liver metastasis , size large liver metastasis great 5 cm , serum CEA great 200 ng/ml . Eligibility Arm C limit least 1 5 risk factor list . Ovarian cancer : Ovarian fallopian tube cancer recurrent treatment refractory remain alternative , approve therapy option reasonable possibility clinical response . Non smallcell lung cancer : Patients stage IIIBIV nonsmall cell lung cancer stable disease clinical response ( CR/PR ) treatment chemotherapy concurrent radiation therapy . Patients may prior therapy cancer adjuvant setting may 14 prior systemic therapy advance cancer . Patients may multiple primary melanoma . Patients less equal 5 brain metastasis may eligible long follow 3 criterion true : 1 . The brain metastases completely remove surgery treat completely stereotactic radiotherapy . Stereotactic radiotherapy , gamma knife , use 1 week prior study entry . 2 . There evident growth brain metastasis since treatment . 3 . No metastasis great 2 cm time protocol entry Patients great 5 brain metastasis may eligible 3 criterion meet least one year elapse since last treatment . All participant must : ECOG performance status 0 1 ( Appendix 3 ) Ability willingness give inform consent Patients must least one intact axillary and/or inguinal lymph node basin . A patient prior lymph node biopsy may candidate lymphoscintigraphy demonstrate intact drainage node basin . A lymphoscintigram may perform screen ensure drainage regional node plan vaccine site . If lymphoscintigram perform sentinel lymph node locate , patient ineligible study vaccine sit available . Laboratory parameter follow : The follow laboratory parameter require participant . If lab value appear error result transient treatable condition , investigator use his/her clinical judgment decide test may repeat . The requirement inclusion follow : HLAA2+ ANC &gt; 1000/mm3 Total lymphocyte count &gt; 500/mm3 . If value low initial test prior cytotoxic therapy , test may repeat patient recovers therapy . Platelets &gt; 100,000/mm3 Hgb ≥ 9 g/dL HGBA1C &lt; 7 % Hepatic : AST ALT ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Bilirubin ≤ 2.5 x ULN Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN Renal Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN Serology ( within 6 month study entry ) HIV negative Hepatitis C negative LDH 2 x ULN Participants must 18 year old study entry . Patients recur progressed either administration cancer vaccine may eligible enroll 12 week follow last vaccination . Exclusion Criteria Patients brain metastasis unless meet criterion outline inclusion criterion section protocol . Patients currently receive systemic cytotoxic chemotherapy , radiation , experimental therapy , receive therapy within precede 4 week . Gamma knife stereotactic radiosurgery may administer within prior 4 week , must administer less one week prior study enrollment . Patients currently receive nitrosoureas receive therapy within precede 6 week . Patients eligible clinically detectable malignancy deem likely investigator require intervention first 12 week study would require premature discontinuation . Examples circumstance may include untreated bone metastasis risk fracture , rapidly progressive low volume disease . Patients know suspected allergy component vaccine . Patients receive follow medication study entry within precede 4 week exclude : 1 . Agents putative immunomodulating activity ( exception nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent topical steroid ( see section 4.2.5 ( 3 ) ) . 2 . Allergy desensitization injection . 3 . Systemic corticosteroid , administer parenterally orally inhaled steroid ( e.g . Advair® , Flovent® , Azmacort® ) permit . Topical corticosteroid acceptable , include steroid low solubility administer nasally local effect ( e.g . Nasonex® ) . 4 . Any pharmacologic growth factor ( e.g . GMCSF , GCSF , erythropoietin ) . 5 . Interferon therapy 6 . Interleukin2 interleukins . 7 . Tolllike receptor agonist , include imiquimod , resiquimod , polyICLC . Participants may vaccinate previously synthetic phosphopeptides include protocol . Pregnancy possibility become pregnant vaccine administration . Female patient childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test ( urinary serum betaHCG ) prior administration first vaccine dose . Males female must agree , consent form , use effective birth control method course vaccination . The method specify consent form include follow : Norplant , IUD , DepProvera , Birth Control Pills , Birth Control Patch , Sterilization . The following may use combined birth control method : Condoms , Jellies foam , Diaphragm , Rhythm , Withdrawal , Sponge , Cervical cap . Women must also breast feeding . Patients medical contraindication potential problem complying requirement protocol , opinion investigator . Patients classify accord New York Heart Association classification Class III IV heart disease ( Appendix 4 ) . Patients body weight &lt; 110 lbs amount frequency blood drawn Participants must know inflammatory condition gastrointestinal tract ( oropharynx , esophagus , stomach , small bowel , colon , rectum , anus ) respiratory tract ( airway lung ) autoimmune , infectious , cause . Examples may include limited , gastritis , C. difficile colitis , radiation proctitis , bronchitis . Patients may condition past recover completely least 3 month prior , expect relapse condition . Participants must prior autoimmune disorder require cytotoxic immunosuppressive therapy , autoimmune disorder visceral involvement . Participants active autoimmune disorder require therapy also exclude . The following exclusionary : The presence laboratory evidence autoimmune disease ( e.g . positive ANA titer ) without associate symptom Clinical evidence vitiligo Other form depigmenting illness Mild arthritis require NSAID medication medical therapy Non smallcell lung cancer express EGFR ALK mutation , neuroendocrine feature .</criteria>
