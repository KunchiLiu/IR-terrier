	<criteria>For Stage 1 , 2 3 subject : Subjects eligible inclusion stage study fulfill follow criterion screen : Healthy male female subject age 18 45 year age include , good health determine past medical history , physical examination , vital sign , electrocardiogram , laboratory test screen . At screening , first baseline , vital sign ( systolic diastolic blood pressure pulse rate ) assess sit position subject rest least three minute , ( require ) three minute stand position . Sitting vital sign within follow range : oral body temperature 35.037.5 °C systolic blood pressure , 90140 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure , 5090 mm Hg pulse rate , 40 90 bpm For Stage 4 subject : Male female subject , age 18 75 year age include , previously identify chronic renal insufficiency ( estimate measure GFR ≤ 45ml/min/1.73m2 , diabetic estimate measure GFR ≤ 60ml/min/1.73m2 . ) Diabetes establish prescription current use antiglycemic drug , random fast glucose level ≥ 144mg/dl hemoglobin A1c ≥ 6.5 % At screening , vital sign ( systolic diastolic blood pressure pulse rate ) assess sit position subject rest least three minute , ( require ) three minute stand position . Sitting vital sign within follow range : oral body temperature 35.037.5 °C systolic blood pressure , 90179 mm Hg diastolic blood pressure , 50100 mm Hg pulse rate , 40 95 bpm For Stages 1 , 2 3 , subject fulfil follow additional criterion eligible inclusion study : An active history clinically significant ECG abnormality determine Investigator , follow ECG abnormality Screening Baseline : Long QT syndrome QTcF &gt; 450 msec ( male ; screen ) QTcF &gt; 460 msec ( female ; screen ) Known history current clinically significant arrhythmia . Use phosphodiesterase5 inhibitor , UNLESS subject agree discontinue use drug duration study . Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman , pregnancy define state female conception termination gestation , confirm positive hCG laboratory test . Women childbearing potential , defined woman physiologically capable become pregnant Smokers ( use tobacco product previous 3 month ) . Urine cotinine level measure screen baseline subject . Smokers define subject report tobacco use and/or urine cotinine ≥ 500 ng/ml . Hemoglobin level 11.0 g/dl screening . Subjects Stage 3 study exclude following : A history allergy topical anesthetic drop A history corneal disease A history eye surgery within three month prior screen A history corneal surgery ( include refractive surgery corneal transplantation ) For Stage 4 , subject fulfil follow additional criterion eligible inclusion study : An active history clinically significant ECG abnormality determine Investigator , follow ECG abnormality Screening Baseline : Long QT syndrome QTcF &gt; 480 msec screening Use phosphodiesterase5 inhibitor , UNLESS subject agree discontinue use drug duration study . Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman , pregnancy define state female conception termination gestation , confirm positive hCG laboratory test . Women childbearing potential , defined woman physiologically capable become pregnant Significant smoker . Significant smoker unable tolerate use 4 cigarette day exclude History right ventricular dysfunction within last 12 month Hemoglobin level 9.0 g/dl screening . Use angiotensin convert enzyme inhibitor ( ACEi ) , UNLESS subject agree either withholding ACEi , switch angiotension receptor blocker , start 5 day ( 5 halflives ever longer ) prior initiation study extend endofstudy visit . Patient withhold ACEi specify duration must first consult primary physician determine suitability safety temporary withholding ACEi . Diureticdependence , i.e . unable produce urine without diuretic , high risk flash pulmonary edema without diuretic . Use diuretic exclude subject UNLESS subject agree withhold diuretic start day prior checkin extend discharge . Consultation subject primary physician must use determine suitability safety temporary withholding diuretic .</criteria>
