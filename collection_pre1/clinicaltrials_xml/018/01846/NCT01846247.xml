	<brief_summary>Phase 3 , multicenter , international randomize controlled trial Very Early Mobilization ( VEM ) care rehabilitation protocol compare standard post stroke care ( SC ) . Participants receive either SC VEM SC alone acute phase stroke period 14 day . Participants follow blind assessor 3 12 month post stroke determine trial outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Very Early Rehabilitation Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>People suffer stroke often left disability weakness , problem speech , think , control bodily function . Severe stroke often result death . The result recent European study indicate patient commence mobility train early stroke ( Day 1 ) recover ability walk quickly return home sooner great number start train one week later stroke . Recently phase II ( pilot ) AVERT study conduct investigator test safety feasibility early mobilisation ( European model ) Stroke patient study randomly receive either standard care early mobilisation ( VEM ) . The study show harm patient VEM group compare standard care deliver VEM feasible . Consequently , grant conduct large phase III study , test effectiveness intervention obtain . In next phase III trial , investigator aim look 2104 patient across stroke care unit city regional hospital . Each hospital ask include 30 60 patient per year study . All stroke patient admitted hospital Stroke Unit ward hospital invite participate . Medical clearance obtain potential participant . Those unconscious ill , together already participate acute drug trial exclude . Patients able provide consent participate . Those able consent third party ( usually relative ) acknowledge participation study . As blind controlled trial , keep assessor patient unaware treatment group important . The investigator inform patient 50 % chance receive one two rehabilitation type hospitalization decide participate . Patients VEM group commence treatment within 24 hour admission hospital . VEM provide trained AVERT physiotherapist , AVERT study nurse aim improve functional mobility . The mobilization activity depend patient 's functional ability tolerance exercise . Patients closely monitor prior mobilization mobilise meet requirement blood pressure vital sign . The number session time spend patient vary , however specific target meet accord intervention protocol . The content timing treatment receive participant either group record . The treatment period study time patient consent , day 14 discharge stroke unit ward . ( Whichever early ) . All participant assess admission study , 3 month , 12 month stroke . Information collect AVERT physiotherapist nurse assessor record individual case record form secure web base data base . Therapists also add information palm pilot , download onto secure website . All information collect patient treat confidential line international guideline local law . The primary outcome measure study number patient dead disable 3 month stroke . Other secondary outcome measure include safety patient , quality life , cost effectiveness . An independent Data Monitoring committee monitor safety , conduct efficacy trial . In addition , independent outcome committee review event report serious .</detailed_description>
