	<brief_summary>Acupuncture treatment may improve cardiac function quality life heart failure patient . These effect may relate inhibition sympathetic activity and/or increase vagal function . The suppression inflammatory reaction acupuncture treatment may also associate outcomes . Specific aim include : 1 . To evaluate effect acupuncture treatment human cardiac sympathetic/vagal activity 2 . To evaluate effect acupuncture treatment cardiac function functional capacity 3 . To evaluate general health score quality-of-life acupuncture treatment 4 . To explore mechanism acupuncture treatment inflammation nitrative stress heart failure patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Acupuncture Cardiac Autonomic Function Human Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim study evaluate effect acupuncture treatment cardiac sympathetic/vagal activity chronic heart failure patient . The investigator would like investigate effect acupuncture treatment cardiac function general health score quality-of-life . The investigator would like explore mechanism acupuncture treatment autonomic imbalance chronic inflammatory reaction heart failure patient compare treatment sham group , baseline treatment change treatment . Chronic heart failure affect million people lead cause death US . Despite advance diagnosis treatment , long-term prognosis quality life chronic heart failure patient remain poor . The mortality chronic heart failure estimate 50 % within 4 year , 50 % patient severe chronic heart failure . Chronic heart failure result leave ventricular ( LV ) systolic and/or diastolic dysfunction . Autonomic imbalance sustain sympathetic overdrive vagal withdrawal play important role development chronic heart failure . This autonomic dysregulation relate increased heart rate , excess inflammatory response , progressive LV dysfunction , increase mortality morbidity chronic heart failure patient . Sympathetic active inhibition beta-adrenergic receptor blocker show significant reduction mortality morbidity chronic heart failure patient . Also modulation parasympathetic activation electrical vagus nerve stimulation ( VNS ) demonstrate potential therapy chronic heart failure . Acupuncture widely use China thousand year treat variety disease symptom . Except pain disorder , increase evidence show acupuncture may useful cardiovascular disease , coronary artery disease , hypertension chronic heart failure . It demonstrate certain acupuncture point show inhibit cardiac sympathetic activation increase cardiac vagal component experimental animal clinical study . Recently small clinical trial Dr. Kristen , et al find acupuncture could improve exercise tolerance chronic heart failure patient . The investigator hypothesize acupuncture treatment may improve cardiac function quality life heart failure patient . These effect may relate inhibition sympathetic activity and/or increase vagal function . The suppression inflammatory reaction acupuncture treatment may also associate outcomes . In addition optimize standard heart failure medication , acupuncture may safe therapeutic strategy chronic heart failure treatment . Studies acupuncture cardiac autonomic activity heart failure may show evidence acupuncture treatment chronic heart failure patient .</detailed_description>
