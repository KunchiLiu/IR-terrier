	<brief_title>A Randomized Phase 2 Trial Combining Sipuleucel-T With Immediate v . Delayed CTLA-4 Blockade Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label randomized multicenter Phase 2 clinical trial combine SipT ipilimumab patient chemotherapy-naïve metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer ( CRPC ) . All patient treat standard SipT ( Q2wks x 3 ) . Patients randomize one two arm : Arm 1 ( Immediate Treatment ) : Ipilimumab Q3wks x 4 start 1 day follow final dose SipT ( Day 0 ) . Arm 2 ( Delayed Treatment ) : Ipilimumab Q3wks x 4 start 3 week follow final dose SipT ( Day 0 ) . Following ipilimumab treatment , patient follow monthly 3 month quarterly disease progression . The definition unacceptable toxicity grade 3 high treatment-related toxicity ( NCI CTCAE v4 ) exclude irAEs . The study assess immunogenicity clinical activity sequential sipuleucel-T treatment follow ipilimumab . Patients experience initial clinical response ipilimumab follow subsequent disease progression offer reinduction treatment ipilimumab .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Histologically confirm , metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma ( positive bone scan and/or measurable disease CT scan and/or MRI abdomen pelvis ) . 2 . Progressive disease androgen deprivation , define PSA Working Group 2 and/or RECIST criterion . Patients must disease progression one following : For patient measurable disease , progression define least 20 % increase sum long diameter ( LD ) target lesion appearance one new lesion , per RECIST criterion version 1.1 . For patient measurable disease , positive bone scan elevate PSA require . PSA evidence progressive prostate cancer consist PSA level least 2 ng/ml , rise least 2 successive occasion , least 1 week apart . If confirmatory PSA value great screen PSA value , additional test rise PSA required document progression . If prior orchiectomy perform , patient must remain LHRH agonist antagonist ( e.g . degarelix ) therapy . Patients receive antiandrogen part primary androgen ablation must demonstrate disease progression follow discontinuation antiandrogen , define two consecutive rise PSA value , obtain least two week apart , document osseous soft tissue progression . At least one PSA value must obtain least four week ( flutamide ) six week ( bicalutamide nilutamide ) discontinuation . 3 . Laboratory requirement : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500/μL Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN Hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL PSA ≥ 2 ng/mL Platelets ≥ 100,000/μL AST ALT less equal 2.5 x ULN Creatinine clearance ≥ 60mL/min Cockcroft Gault equation Testosterone le equal 50 ng/dL 4 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 life expectancy ≥ 12 week . 5 . At least 18 year age old . 6 . Patients receive hormonal therapy , include dose megestrol acetate ( Megace ) , Proscar ( finasteride ) , herbal product know decrease PSA level ( e.g . Saw Palmetto , PCSPES ) , systemic corticosteroid , must discontinue agent least four week prior study treatment . Progressive disease define must document discontinuation hormonal therapy ( exception LHRH agonist ) . 7 . Prior radiation therapy must complete ≥ 4 week prior enrollment patient must recover toxicity . Prior radiopharmaceutical ( strontium , samarium ) must complete ≥ 8 week prior enrollment . 8 . Because unknown potential risk gamete and/or develop embryo investigational therapy , patient must agree use adequate contraception ( barrier method male ) duration study participation , three month discontinue therapy . 1 . Prior chemotherapy prostate cancer , exception neoadjuvant chemotherapy , potential effect chemotherapy immune system . 2 . Prior sipuleucelT treatment investigational immunotherapy . 3 . Prostate cancer pain require regularly schedule narcotic . 4 . Current treatment systemic steroid therapy ( inhaled/topical steroid acceptable ) . Systemic corticosteroid must discontinue least 4 week prior first treatment . 5 . History autoimmune disease include , limited : Systemic lupus erythematosis ( SLE ) , scleroderma , CREST syndrome , rheumatoid arthritis Inflammatory bowel disease , celiac disease , primary biliary cirrhosis , autoimmune hepatitis Dermatomyositis , polymyositis , giant cell arteritis Autoimmune hemolytic anemia ( AIHA ) , cryoglobulinemia , antiphospholipid antibody syndrome ( APLS ) Diabetes mellitus type I , myasthenia gravis , Grave 's disease Wegener 's granulomatosis vasculitis A history Hashimoto 's thyroiditis , psoriasis , eczema , inactive least one year , isolate Raynaud 's phenomenon acceptable 6 . Known central nervous system visceral metastasis . 7 . Medical psychiatric illness would , opinion investigator , preclude participation study ability patient provide informed consent . 8 . Cardiovascular disease meet one following : congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association Class III IV ) , active angina pectoris , recent myocardial infarction ( within last 6 month ) . 9 . Concurrent prior malignancy except follow : Adequately treat basal squamous cell skin cancer Adequately treat stage I II cancer patient currently complete remission Any cancer patient diseasefree 5 year 10 . Known HIV history immunodeficiency disorder . 11 . Prisoners subject compulsorily detain ( involuntarily incarcerate ) treatment either psychiatric medical ( e.g . infectious ) illness . 12 . Any underlying medical psychiatric condition , opinion investigator make administration ipilimumab hazardous obscure interpretation AEs , condition associate frequent diarrhea . 13 . A history prior treatment ipilimumab prior CD137 agonist CTLA4 inhibitor agonist .</criteria>
