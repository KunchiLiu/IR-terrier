	<brief_summary>The purpose study collect long-term safety efficacy data participant treat PCI-32765 ( Ibrutinib ) provide ongoing access PCI-32765 participant currently enrol PCI-32765 study complete accord parent protocol , actively receive treatment PCI-32765 , continue benefit PCI-32765 treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Long-term Extension Study PCI-32765 ( Ibrutinib )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( identity assign study drug know ) study design collect long-term safety efficacy data provide PCI-32765 ( Ibrutinib ) access participant complete PCI-32765 study . PCI-32765 ( Ibrutinib ) first-in-class , potent , orally-administered , covalently-binding small molecule inhibitor bruton 's tyrosine kinase . `` PCI-32765 '' `` ibrutinib '' refer molecule ; hereafter , `` PCI-32765 '' use . Participants continue current PCI-32765 dosing regimen establish parent PCI-32765 study investigator determine participant longer benefit treatment ( ie , disease progression unacceptable toxicity occur ) , study terminate sponsor , participant withdraws consent , alternative access PCI-32765 available feasible , reason define protocol . Safety monitor throughout study summarize . Efficacy may analyze combination data collect parent protocol . Blood sample lymph node biopsy sample biomarker evaluation collect time disease progression End Treatment visit participant discontinue treatment without disease progression ( local regulation ship logistics permit ) . There formal hypothesis test plan long-term extension study . Participants receive treatment single-agent PCI-32765 continue end study , define time last End-of-Treatment safety assessment last subject participate study 5 year last subject enter , upon decision sponsor terminate study , whichever occur early .</detailed_description>
