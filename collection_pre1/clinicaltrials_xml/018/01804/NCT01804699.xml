	<brief_summary>Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy ( ARVC ) inherit condition may cause life threaten irregular heart rhythm often manifest unexpected cardiac arrest sudden death early adulthood . The condition difficult diagnose often noticed family member suffers cardiac arrest death . The Canadian National ARVC registry collect data Inherited Heart Rhythm Clinics across Canada . STUDY OBJECTIVES : Primary : 1 . To determine natural history ARVC ( short/intermediate term ) , include risk symptomatic arrhythmia sudden death , patient phenotype gene positive patient without phenotype evidence disease . 2 . To understand risk factor sudden death/appropriate ICD use ARVC , include test characteristics/performance relationship outcome ( ECG , Holter , signal average ECG , loop recorder , imaging , voltage mapping , T wave alternans , cardiac biopsy biomarkers ) . 3 . To establish phenotype genotype correlation , include comparison patient disease cause mutation , variant unknown significance ( VUS ) Task Force Criteria ( TFC ) positive , gene negative patient</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy ( ARVC ) familial condition characterize onset life threaten ventricular arrhythmia early adulthood , present ventricular tachycardia , cardiac arrest sudden death1 . The disease diagnose wide range test focus image right ventricle assess ambient arrhythmia abnormal electrical substrate . These factor collate score form ARVC Task Force Criteria , know specific sensitive 2 , 3 . These criterion revise 2010 , introduce broader quantitative approach diagnosis include genetic testing result , intend enhance sensitivity without reduce specificity 4 . An online tool Task Force Criteria calculation develop Principal Investigator enable calculation real time , export PDF excel format , free public use ( http : //qstatistic.com/pdg/public.php ? rep=arvc_cri ) .These criterion take account electrocardiographic imaging finding , along tissue analysis family history . They account finding genetic testing , confound part unknown significance positive genetic test absence phenotype disease variable penetrance expressivity 2 , 4-12 . The disease predominantly cause defect cell-cell adhesion PROJECT APPROVAL PROCESS : For new project analysis New project proposal Canadian National ARVC Registry review case-by-case basis Steering Committee . The following item must include new proposal : 1 . Project description necessary background , hypotheses methodology/protocol 2 . A comprehensive list funding source ( ) detail budget 3 . Local Research Ethics Board ( REB ) approval PATIENT RECRUITMENT &amp; SCREENING PROCESS : 1 . Patients approach participate Registry specialty clinic involve Registry across Canada . 2 . Once informed consent obtain ARVC affect patient undergo baseline data collection include : 1 . Collection standard clinical testing ARVC ( affected patient ) accord local clinical practice i.e . MRI , ECG etc . Family member undergo screen deem necessary local investigator 2 . Baseline clinical history 3 . Family history exercise history 4 . A family pedigree construct . 5 . An online tool pedigree construction develop Principal Investigator Dr. Andrew Krahn enable creation pedigree real time well link patient genetics database , export PDF format , ( demonstration version http : //ocrr.ca/pdg/i.php ? loc=dmo , contact kgibbs @ provicdencehealth.bc.ca access ) 6 . Patients enrol database prevalent case previously identify , incident case 7 . Other test applicable 3 . Genetic Information ( applicable ) . Once informed consent obtain patient undergo baseline data collection invite participate optional DNA biobanking arm study : 4 . Genetic Screening ARVC standard clinical evaluation individual ARVC well 1st degree family member do clinically send commercial laboratory per standard enrol centre 5 . If participant consent biobanking arm study additional blood sample ( Please see ARVC Lab Manual detail ) collect baseline store subsequent analysis . These analysis may include measurement serum Troponin T , NT-pro-BNP , C-reactive protein biomarkers determine association progression disease ; term cardiac structure ( i.e . change right ventricular volume ) electrical substrate ( i.e . number ICD shock ) time . DATA COLLECTION : Baseline : 1 . Patients require provide write informed consent participate study . 2 . The local Research Ethics Board ( REB ) must approve informed consent document . 3 . All demographic information , clinical test genetic result enter password-protected database . Core Data Set ( require ) : The core data set consist baseline follow-up clinical test establish participant eligibility accord 2010 Revised Task Force Criteria . The core data set include follow : 1 . Resting ECG 2 . Signal average ECG 3 . Transthoracic echocardiogram 4 . Treadmill exercise test 5 . 24 hour Holter monitor 6 . Cardiac MRI Additional test result ( clinically indicate ) : The following comprises typical list additional test result may collect available . These test result collect clinically indicate participant ( ) . 1 . Right ventricular angiography 2 . Right ventricular biopsy 3 . Right ventricular voltage map 4 . Ability induce ventricular tachycardia Electrophysiologic test 5 . Transesophageal echocardiogram 6 . T wave alternans 7 . Cardiac CT scan Genetic Testing Results : 1 . Optional blood drawn banking PHRI process local site ship Cryovials banking PHRI Hamilton , Ontario . Specimen ( ) collect ( i.e . blood , saliva , DNA ) process locally ship PHRI . 2 . Blood drawn standard clinical ARVC genetic test commercial laboratory Canada ( For example : Ontario SickKids Department Paediatric Laboratory Medicine CHEO Molecular Genetics Diagnostic Laboratory perform ARVC test ) package ship accord local site labs independent specification . 3 . Genetic test result enter secure , password-protected database . These result de-identified code list linkage clinical data . Follow-up : Follow-up visit Registry occur annual basis follow testing : 1 . Resting ECG 2 . Signal average ECG 3 . 24 hour Holter Monitor 4 . Clinical History 5 . Screening new cardiac symptom , : syncope , palpitation , cardiac arrest , ICD implant , ICD therapy sudden death Clinical follow-up data collect accord standard local practice . It ideal reassess participant clinically , however feasible reason - telephone interview conduct assess new clinical finding new event take place . If site wish conduct telephone follow - follow clinical test still require annual follow visit : 1 . Resting ECG 2 . Signal average ECG possible 3 . 24 hour Holter Monitor ECGs Holter tracing obtain remote area finding enter database annual follow purpose . 3-Year Reassessment : After 3 year participation study , participant reassess base 2010 task force criterion . This include following : 1 . Resting ECG 2 . Signal average ECG 3 . Transthoracic echocardiogram 4 . Treadmill exercise test 5 . 24 hour Holter monitor 6 . Cardiac MRI 7 . Clinical History 8 . Screening new cardiac symptom , : syncope , palpitation , cardiac arrest , ICD implant , ICD therapy sudden death There currently obligation enter data beyond 3 year mark , however sit encouraged continue follow participant indefinitely . The Registry open-ended local REB approval participant 's follow data continue enter long declared letter information originally give participant . DATA MANAGEMENT : Data point collection present internet base database ( see online demo http : //www.qstatistic.com/arvc/demo ) . The database host University British Columbia Research Institute Vancouver British Columbia . The research institute compliance national Canadian PIPEDA privacy guideline . Data enter directly e-CRFs electronic submission server locate UBC Research Institute , Vancouver BC collect personal identifier ( password protect internet base system ) .
