	<brief_summary>Dietary management integral aspect self care many chronic disease . Craving Change™ standard program already offer many Family Health Teams ( FHT ) patient interested mindful food choice . The program help patient understand difficulty modify behaviour associate diet , address impact emotion eat behaviour provide affect regulation strategy . Existing literature show emotion strong effect food choice emotion regulation lead improvement food choice . Craving Change™ , however , currently selectively offer FHTs patient deem high risk cardiovascular disease evaluate context . For study , propose 1 ) Selectively target patient higher cardiometabolic risk ; 2 ) Evaluate effect program ( modified address chronic disease ) pilot Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) . If find effective , modify Craving Change™ program , call `` Beyond Fork : A health-centred approach manage chronic disease '' , could broadly implement within Family Health Teams .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Managing Problematic Eating Behaviours With Dietary Management Chronic Disease Self-management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study specifically focus Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 Hypertension chronic condition dietary management integral part manage condition , also major factor poor outcome . Many current approach intervention use treat condition provide patient information `` '' eating behaviour change `` '' change , DEP ( Diabetes Education Program ) CDSM ( Chronic Disease Self-Management , aka Stanford ) . The new intervention propose study primarily base material Craving Change™ program ; focus provide patient understand `` '' difficult change problematic eating behaviour . The new information add specific chronic disease management . The original Craving Change™ program provide patient information environment , physical body emotional reaction contribute problematic eating behaviour thus increase difficulty change behaviour . The Craving Change™ program also provide patient tool overcome identified obstacle environment , physical body emotional reaction order facilitate behaviour change . Patients diagnosis Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 and/or Hypertension poorly control , often required make dietary change improve condition often struggle make necessary dietary behaviour change . By provide patient behavioural intervention use main component Craving Change™ program along additional information specific chronic disease management , overall aim help patient improve control chronic condition diagnose . As feasibility study , main goal determine patient diagnose chronic disease ( ) recruit successfully , stay program experience change perception eat behaviour result learn various strategy offer program . Specifically , study focus whether strategy learn improve emotion regulation , turn could facilitate behaviour change . Our primary outcome measure EEQ ( `` Emotional Eater Questionnaire '' ) ; validate 10 item questionnaire measure degree interaction emotion food choice . This study Randomized Control Trial . The set 3 Family Health Teams Greater Toronto Area . Eligibility criterion include rostered status Family Health Team , previous participation program use Craving Change™ , diagnosis Diabetes Mellitus Type 2 and/or Hypertension , 2 3 high A1c / BP / LDL . Patients identify use Electronic Medical Records ( EMRs ) patient meet criterion send EEQ via mail . Patients consent participation invite intake blood pressure ( BP ) , height/weight/waist circumference ( ht/wt/wc ) measure patient randomize immediate participation program wait list control . After 6 week EEQ re-administered , BP , ht/wt/wc measure .</detailed_description>
