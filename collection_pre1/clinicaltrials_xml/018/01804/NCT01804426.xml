	<brief_summary>Post-traumatic stress disorder , PTSD , one prevalent psychiatric disorder . As casualty motor vehicle accident , criminal act terrorism arrive ER , almost impossible conclude overcome psychiatric trauma able return normal life course thrown promising life trajectory . Current attempt identify great risk still unsatisfactory , comprise therapeutic dilemma , since intervention use ameliorate prevent occurrence PTSD high-risk patient , might counter-productive even precipitate emergence PTSD lower-risk patient . Since PTSD closely related `` Fight , Flight Freeze '' reaction , much autonomic nervous system major stress hormone , cortisol . Despite many study demonstrate involvement factor development PTSD , various attempt profile direction association PTSD cortisol abnormality yield conflict result . The introduction novel method assess excretion cortisol use residue human hair shaft , allow unprecedented evaluation activity prolong period time . Using novel method cortisol assessment , investigator aim identify biomarkers able aid prediction PTSD development ahead symptom emergence , enhance understanding physiological mechanism involve etiology disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) stem event perceive threat physical psychological integrity individual . Despite evidence point predispose protective factor , extremely difficult predict develop PTSD exposure traumatic event . However , paramount importance predict clinical course , order intervene early stage facilitate research may lead prevention disorder . As certain feature PTSD closely resemble response adrenergic system via fight flight mechanism , substantial effort make understand role hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) development maintenance disorder . Various study demonstrate conflict finding , trend level cortisol time endocrinological anomaly . Additional study assess effect HPA axis suppression dexamethasone anxiety-related symptom healthy volunteer subject stress test . Those participant whose HPA axis inhibit , present significant increase anxiety symptom , compare control group . Variability lack stability main disadvantage current method quantify systemic cortisol level via measurement plasma , urine saliva . These shortcoming undermine effort understand role HPA axis PTSD . Variable timing test , well stress involve psychiatric examination phlebotomy , also major confounders effort . Recently , introduction novel test hair cortisol concentration ( HCC ) enable retrospective quantification cortisol level , thus HPA axis activity , prolonged period time . As hair grows , unbounded cortisol incorporate hair shaft manner correlate amount unbounded plasma cortisol time period . Since scalp hair grow fairly constant rate 1cm per month , especially posterior vertex area , analysis 3cm would reflect average level unbounded cortisol throughout previous 3 month . Several study animal human establish test 's stability time , thus prove test reliably reflect major change HPA axis . Studies evaluate novel test field mental health demonstrate variation cortisol level number clinical population : increase hair cortisol level demonstrate 6 month period depress patient compare control ; community expose horror war Uganda elevate cortisol level compare Ugandan community live war zone ; among patient generalize anxiety disorder ( GAD ) , low hair cortisol level comparison control population , despite similar cortisol saliva level . In addition advantage reliable measurement unbound plasma cortisol level time , novel test also easy perform , easy store cause minimal inconvenience patient actual risk . The use novel method test cortisol level prolong period time enable u study course HPA axis relation stressor : baseline status , immediate aftermath continuous effect traumatic event axis . Such valuable information aid ongoing debate , whether baseline function HPA axis core predisposing factor , fact , secondary causality traumatic event . Achieving well understand complex interplay biological mechanism formation PTSD might enable target high-risk population traumatic exposure pharmacological psychological intervention . Study Hypothesis Main Hypothesis 1 . Hair cortisol level previous trauma correlate PTSD development . Secondary Hypothesis 2 . Ratio hair cortisol level prior trauma saliva cortisol level follow traumatic event correlate PTSD development . 3 . Saliva cortisol level immediately trauma correlate PTSD development . 4 . Hair cortisol level one month post trauma correlate PTSD development . 5 . Ratio saliva cortisol level saliva alpha-amylase level ( take ER immediately trauma ) correlate PTSD development . 6 . Patients difference hair cortisol level 3 month prior traumatic event level 3 month follow , prone develop PTSD . Study Methods Prospective observational study , perform Meir Medical Center , Kfar Saba , Israel Shalvata Mental Health Center , Hod Hasharon , Israel . 50 men woman arrive Meir medical center Emergency department , result traumatic civil event , recruit . Participants fill demographic medical history questionnaire , structure psychiatric interview ( M.I.N.I ) perform exclude active psychiatric disorder . If none exclusion criterion meet , several procedure perform : 1 . Sampling hair posterior vortex . 2 . Sampling blood cortisol saliva cortisol alpha-amylase . 3 . Documenting pulse time admission ER 6 hour follow event . 4 . Filling number questionnaire : SLE ( stressful life event ) ; BDI ( Beck Depression Scale ) ; MADRSS ( Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ) ; STAI ( State &amp; Trait Anxiety Inventory ) ; VAS-A , VAS-D ; PDEQ ( Peritraumatic Dissociation Experience Questionnaire ) ; SASRQ ( Stanford Acute Stress Reaction Questionnaire ) . Psychiatric follow-up perform 4 time point , relation traumatic event : After 1 month , 3 month , 6 month 12 month . During assessment , follow procedure perform : 1 . Sampling hair posterior vortex . 2 . Filling number questionnaire : BDI , MADRSS , STAI , VAS-A , VAS-D , CAPS ( Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale ) , PSS ( PTSD Symptoms Scale ) . Relevance potential study finding The propose study provide novel information role HPA axis development PTSD . By answer old , unresolved question investigator achieve understand neurobiological mechanism may able predict development disorder early , sub-clinical stage . The result study also contribute understand rationale possibility steroid treatment follow acute traumatic event .</detailed_description>
