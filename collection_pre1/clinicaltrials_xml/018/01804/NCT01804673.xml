	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety Tolerability Fentanyl Iontophoretic Transdermal System ( Fentanyl-ITS ) Management Post-Surgery Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open label ( people know identity intervention ) , single arm , multi-center ( one hospital medical school team work medical research study ) study evaluate safety efficacy fentanyl-ITS management acute moderate severe pain post-operative participant ' undergone elective surgery ( surgery could postpone do without danger participant ) . The study consist 2 phase : screening phase ( comprise pre-operative post-operative stage ) open label treatment phase . The participant treat 40 microgram ( mcg ) fentanyl transdermally per on-demand dose ; deliver 10 minute maximum 6 dos ( 240 mcg ) per hour 24 hour maximum 80 dos ( 3.2 milligram [ mg ] ) . Each system inactivate 80 dos 24 hour , whichever occur first . A new system apply every 24 hour unless participant use 80 dos less 24 hour . Maximum treatment duration 72 hour allow . Participants expect require parenteral ( administration injection ) opioids ( morphine like medication ) least 24 hour post-operatively . This study evaluate participant 's , nurse 's physician 's assessment fentanyl-ITS routine condition . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
