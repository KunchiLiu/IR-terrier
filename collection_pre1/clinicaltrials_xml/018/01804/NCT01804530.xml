	<detailed_description>Part 1 . Open-label , sequential PLX7486 TsOH single-agent dose escalation approximately 60 patient solid tumor . Part 2c . Based upon safety clinical activity observation , extension cohort plan RP2D single-agent PLX7486 TsOH approximately 30 patient : 1 . Advanced , non-resectable tumor histology growth driven CSF-1R activity activate Trk ( NTRK ) point NTRK fusion mutation ( e.g. , mammary analogue secretory carcinoma , secretory breast cancer , papillary thyroid cancer , congenital fibrosarcoma , congenital mesoblastic nephroma , lung cancer , melanoma , colon cancer ) underlie pathology pathophysiology suggest NTRK signaling may play significant role disease ( e.g. , TrkC/NT3 overexpression adenoid cystic carcinoma , TrkB/BDNF overexpression non-small cell lung cancer ) AND receive prior treatment , know therapy result increase survival particular disease OR 2 . Unresectable , locally advanced refractory TGCT ( include metastatic disease )</detailed_description>
