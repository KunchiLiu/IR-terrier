	<detailed_description>Methods 39 Medical Wards 12 Emergency Departments , belong 12 hospital , voluntarily enrol . Through collaboration 12 Multidisciplinary Teams ( MT ) , take Pre-EOI picture human resource ( i.e . doctor patient ratio ) organisational structure ( i.e . laboratory 's opening hour ) hospital . For six month , unit enrol ask fill Clinical Checklist every patient suspect severe sepsis septic shock ; Pre-EOI `` sepsis six '' bundle compliance could evaluate . Then , plan several pre-agreed educational meeting doctor nurse belong enrolled ward . In meanwhile MT work overcome impediment well septic patient management . Finally , educate medical staff ask fill Clinical Checklist use Pre-EOI phase ; Post-EOI `` sepsis six '' bundle compliance could evaluate comparison Pre-EOI phase could do . Hypothesis This first study aim analyze impact Educational Organizational Intervention outcome septic patient manage Critical Care Units . We guess difference show human resource organizational structure among hospital could role `` sepsis six '' bundle compliance patient 's outcome , comparison data collect clinical checklist patient 's outcome confirm guess . Likewise , believe educational intervention could improve septic patient 's management , need Post-EOI phase conclusion demonstrate hypothesis .</detailed_description>
