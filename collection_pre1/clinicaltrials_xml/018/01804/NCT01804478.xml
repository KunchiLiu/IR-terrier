	<brief_summary>SPECIFIC AIMS The limbs diabetic patient associate decrease capillary density , arterial inflow , local blood flow leg . Decreased perfusion adversely affect wound heal viability tissue , especially patient peripheral vascular disease diabetes . The investigator hypothesize mild external compression restore decrease skin muscle blood flow would great increase microvascular blood flow induce leg compression compare healthy subject . Blood flow measure use Photoplethysmography ( PPG ) , , external compression , muscle oxygenation measure Near Infrared Spectroscopy ( NIRS ) . The specific aim : - To measure Muscle Blood Flow ( MBF ) , Skin Blood Flow ( SBF ) , Bone Blood Flow ( BBF ) microcirculatory alteration leg foot cause mild external compression healthy subject patient diabetes . - To measure muscle oxygenation change leg foot cause mild external compression healthy subject patient diabetes . - To optimize pressure Continuous Compression induce maximum microcirculatory blood flow healthy subject patient diabetes . - To optimize compression pressure , duration , frequency Intermittent Pneumatic Compression ( IPC ) induce maximum microcirculatory blood flow healthy subject patient diabetes . - To measure microcirculatory response compression patient diabetes - Continue validate photoplethysmography tool measure microcirculation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE Therapies utilize external compression leg prevent deep venous thrombosis , decrease low extremity edema , manage chronic venous insufficiency , increase heal treatment venous stasis ulcer . In diabetic patient ' foot , microcirculation compromise lead increase chance ulcer formation . Therefore , therapy utilize compression low leg could beneficial population compression therapy show increase limb perfusion . In recent decade , investigator find intermittent compression calf foot produce acute increase arterial inflow limb . Moreover , intermittent pneumatic compression high pressure ( 120 mmHg ) increase skin perfusion popliteal artery inflow . Compression stock produce much low pressure ( around 20-40 mmHg ) still aid ulcer heal . The commercial system use rapid compression last 3 less , foot calf pressure ( 80-100 mmHg ) . Longer compression duration ( 10 60 mmHg ) moderate inflation rate supine patient effective increase flow velocity femoral artery , mean system necessarily need high level compression rapid inflation period uncomfortable . An optimal therapy individual patient peripheral vascular disease increase microvascular flow limb long period possible . Relatively little known local circulation context treatment venous disease compression therapy . It know venous disease decrease muscle skin oxygenation , acute chronic physiologic adaptation compression therapy increase large small vessel blood flow capillary growth . Compression pressure range 20-120 mmHg use , little physiologic evidence support optimal pressure therapy . Little previous research look duration hyperemia external compression , purpose therapy important , since compression cycle must set maximize period hyperemia . Another unknown whether intermittent compression increase blood flow great extent compare continuous compression . The major variable compression therapy compression pressure , duration compression , frequency compression . The investigator aware study date examine variable context skin muscle microvascular blood flow leg . Photoplethysmography ( PPG ) non-invasive optical technique measure local microvascular blood flow . PPG direct light light emit diode ( LED ) toward skin ; light scatter absorbed skin deep tissue . Green light LEDs place close photodetector measure skin blood flow . Infrared LEDs place farther photodetector penetrate several centimeter underlying muscle . Blood flow change tissue cause change intensity scatter light record photodetector . This technique validate multiple study invasive method consider best non-invasive measurement local muscle blood flow . For skeletal muscle , PPG provide equivalent result compare invasive laser Doppler technique . However , frequent motion artifacts local tissue trauma limit laser Doppler 's usefulness . In patient central venous hypertension due heart failure , hypothesize increase compression-induced leg muscle microvascular blood flow occur proportion increase central venous pressure . It also hypothesize patient diabetes , increase compression-induced foot microvascular blood flow occur proportion increase central venous pressure .</detailed_description>
