	<brief_summary>The study aim validate clinical efficacy telemedicine- web-based system platform Self-monitoring blood glucose ( SMBG ) data transmission analysis term improve metabolic control , assess measuring change HbA1c , insulin-treated diabetic patient . The system platform involve ( . ) systematic ( real-time anywhere ) transmission SMBG data decision support software ( DSS ) -assisted server , ( ii . ) web-based analysis data , ( iii . ) feedback patient medical staff implement metabolic control . The expected outcome use telemedicine-based system transmission SMBG data , web-based analysis data medical feedback patient medical team improve glucose control insulin-treated individual type 1 type 2 diabetes mellitus .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Self-monitoring blood glucose ( SMBG ) currently recommend type 1 diabetic patient type 2 diabetic treat insulin ( ≥4 glucose test per day ) , tool favor achievement glucose control . It still debate whether SMBG also useful achieve improve glucose control non-insulin treat type 2 diabetes due discordant result intervention trial [ Farmer AJ , 2009 ] . In general , assume usefulness SMBG fully meet SMBG perform structured manner , patient medical team make use SMBG result optimize lifestyle drug therapy ; result effective control hyperglycemia hypoglycemia , result less glucose variability [ IDF , 2009 ] . SMBG currently perform majority diabetic patient , include non-insulin treated type 2 patient ; however , SMGB procedure often far satisfactory due inappropriate frequency test , data collection data analysis , result suboptimal impact disease management . Thus , multiple unmet need currently exist SMBG procedure , could resolve ( . ) implement appropriate SMBG test frequency ( # blood glucose ( BG ) tests/day-week-month ) ; ( ii . ) temporally localize BG test respect fast period vs. meals/snacks ; ( iii . ) improve quality control SMBG procedure ( use strip , calibration , test , data collection analysis ) ; ( iv . ) make SMBG result available statistical medical analysis monitor diabetes status adjust lifestyle drug therapy need ; ( v. ) provide patient appropriate feed-back driven SMBG data analysis ; ( vi . ) monitor real-time SMBG data detect emergency situation ( e.g. , severe hypoglycemia , persistent hyperglycemia ) assist patient appropriate timely intervention . There grow body evidence suggest telemedicine effective intervention improve glucose control . Use telephone contact , video-conferencing , personal digital assistant web-based system offer new opportunity bridge gap support patient diabetes face face visit health care provider . Several small-scale non-randomized study find patient exposed telemonitoring intervention low HbA1c value without . Moreover , large randomize controlled study also show promising result . In comprehensive randomize comparison telemonitoring intervention yet complete , IDEATel study , 1,665 participant randomize telemedicine unit conventional care . At 1 year , patient intervention group show significantly low HbA1c ( -0.38 % p &lt; 0.01 ) , systolic diastolic blood pressure , ( respectively , -3.4 mmHg , p= 0.001 ; -1.9 mmHg , p &lt; 0.001 ) , low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol ( -9.5 mg/dL , p &lt; 0.001 ) . In patient blindly assess annually period five year , find telemedicine group score good standard care group virtually outcome measure annual evaluation . Mortality different group , although power limit [ Shea S , 2009 ] . More recently , Charpentier et al. , six-month multicenter study , enrol 180 adult patient type 1 diabetes basal-bolus insulin regimen , baseline HbA1c ≥8 % . Patients randomize either usual quarterly follow-up , home use smartphone recommend insulin dos quarterly visit , use smartphone short teleconsultations every two week visit endpoint ( Diabeo system ) . Use Diabeo system yield 0.91 % decrease HbA1c control 0.67 % decrease HbA1c use without teleconsultation . There difference frequency hypoglycemic episodes medical time spend hospital telephone consultation . However , patient use Diabeo system spend nearly 5 h less patient group attend hospital visit [ Charpentier G , 2011 ] . Similarly , Bujnowska-Fedak et al enrol total 100 adult patient type 2 diabetes , divide insulin- non-insulin-requiring , randomize , control trial aim investigating effect telehome monitoring . The experimental group ( n = 50 ) receive in-home wireless glucose monitor transmitter , whereas control group ( n = 50 ) instruct follow conventional arrangement . There overall reduction HbA1c value experimental control group 6 month . A significant difference HbA1c value group observe among noninsulin-requiring patient . The experimental group report considerably less hyperglycemic hypoglycemic event . The profile patient benefit telemonitoring consist old , educate patient , acquire disease relatively recently , spend time home . The experimental group high overall score quality life measure sense control diabetes [ Bujnowska-Fedak MM , 2011 ] . A recent meta-analysis 22 trial total 1,657 participant show mobile phone intervention diabetes self-management reduced HbA1c value mean 0.5 % median 6-month follow-up duration . Interestingly , type 2 diabetes patient report significantly great reduction HbA1c type 1 diabetes patient ( 0.8 vs. 0.3 % ; P = 0.02 ) [ Liang X , 2011 ] . In conclusion , telemedicine case management intervention tele-home care may potentially assist daily diabetes management via establishment active interaction diabetic patient healthcare professional . However , evidence warrant , particularly consider new innovative system potential implementation patient 's assistance diabetes drug therapy remotely . We recently develop telemedicine system [ Glucoonline® , 2011 ] , consist smartphone-connected glucometer , software-implemented smartphone real-time anywhere BG data collection transmission remote server , Decision Supported Software ( DSS ) -assisted server capable perform data collection analysis , provide feed-back patient medical staff accord pre-defined specific algorithm . A pilot study show feasibility use system 10 individual type 1 diabetes treat multiple daily injection ( MDI ) regimen 3-month period already carry [ Giorgino F , data file ] . We believe system could utilize prospective randomize control trial investigate suitability enable improve glucose control insulin-treated individual type 1 type 2 diabetes mellitus .</detailed_description>
