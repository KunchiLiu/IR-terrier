	<brief_title>Study Bicycle Seat Effects Male Perineal Blood Flow</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : An independent market research company release report 1997 , estimate bicycling industry worth astound 4.5 billion dollar . ( 1 ) The magnitude number give u idea popularity sport . An important component bicycle saddle , affect comfort , performance , rider 's health . Several study report sexual side effect male bicyclist , specifically temporary genital numbness erectile dysfunction . Goldstein et . al claim article prolonged pressure perineal region cause arterial damage result erectile dysfunction men . These result trigger bike manufacturer come various saddle design claim reduce risk men . For project investigator want correlate bike rid effect male reproductive organ measure pressure exert perineum blood flow cycling . Previous study matter show high percentage bicyclist effect Erectile Dysfunction ( ED ) compare general population . There many publish study hemodynamics penis use Pulse Oximetry , Doppler Ultrasound CAPSV measurement . Investigators goal able measure pressure exert artery supply penis via saddle perineum . A study , attempt carry measurement similar , used pressure transducer place saddle stationary bike . There flaws study , investigator want improve upon design research experiment . For example , place sensor saddle enable measurement force saddle directly relate pressure exert perineum . In word place sensor saddle researcher able distinguish pressure exert perineum body part contact sensor seat , sit bone . Also , use stationary bike physic body force perineum different compare road bike road mountain bike rough terrain . Investigators study corrects flaw . Purpose study : Can investigators measure blood flow perineum via perineal artery see effect bicycle rid blood flow artery ? Design : This pilot study involve 2 step determine perineal blood flow bicycle seat affect flow . The first step use doppler ultrasound measure perineal blood flow Ultrasound suite University Illinois Chicago Medical Center . At visit , patient ask lie frog-leg/lithotomy position exam table allow access perineum . The linear ultrasound probe ( L12-55 ) use measure flow perineal/cavernosal artery . By apply sequentially increase pressure , critical pressure occlusion measure along flow rate various applied perineal pressure . The second step involve bicycle ride perineal pressure measure . Investigators use disposable sensor tegaderm stick sensor perineum . No shave perineum require long sensor able secure . The record device credit card size attach bicycle . The subject ride use six different bike seat standard road course also stationary trainer . This conclude requirement patient . The pressure obtain bicycle ride compare critical occlusion pressure flow-pressure relationship measure ultrasound suite . Recruitment : Patients recruit project via various bicycle meeting . Cyclist approach via oral presentation men age 18-64 , avid cyclist risk undue influence ( i.e . UIC student ) . Please see attached recruitment script . Risks Involved : The study involve minimal risk subject subject already cyclist use mild exercise involve cycling . Sensors use electric input patient harm . All data acquire use noninvasive radiology , ultrasound doppler .</detailed_description>
