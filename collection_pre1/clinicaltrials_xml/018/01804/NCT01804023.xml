	<detailed_description>Screening test perform detect exclusion criterion . After confirm absence point-of-care exclusion criterion , four applicator ( # 1 4 , `` sham '' applicator ) handle participant , insert vagina gel expel waste container . Four applicator ( # 5 8 ) insert participant 's vagina , one time , investigator , remove , gel expel waste container . Two applicator ( # 9 10 ) insert participant 's vagina , one time , gel expel participant 's vagina . Finally , two applicator ( # 11 12 ) insert participant 's vagina , one time , investigator , remove gel expel waste container . Applicators # 11 12 wiped clean paper towel . Thus , participant provide total 12 applicator , half process within one week visit half process approximately one month visit . Three reader blind status applicator ( sham , insert without gel expulsion ) determine , VIRA UV light assessment , whether applicator insert vaginally . Additional laboratory personnel , also blind status applicator , process applicator DNA protein marker product adherence protocol compliance .</detailed_description>
