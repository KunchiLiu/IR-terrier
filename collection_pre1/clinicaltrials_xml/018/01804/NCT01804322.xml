Primary objective study verify comprehensive standardize educational plan follow significant reduction number adult patient epilepsy comorbidity present clinically relevant adverse treatment effect . Secondary objective include effect number adverse treatment event , health-related quality life ( HRQOL ) , direct medical cost , patient 's compliance .

Included consecutive adult outpatient 1+ concurrent clinical condition chronic treatment least one clinically relevant treatment-related adverse event and/or clinically relevant drug interaction . Eligible patient randomize receive comprehensive standardize educational plan ( experimental arm ) usual care , ie management adverse event/drug interaction do clinical practice ( control arm ) . The experimental plan consist discuss patient caregiver cause nature adverse event/drug interaction , tolerability profile drug , clinical manifestation associate current drug interaction ( ) , contraindication potentially interfere over-the-counter drug , indication benefit suggest treatment change , withdrawal potentially interfering , contraindicated ineffective drug . All patient see one , three six month admission . Expected result : The number patient free clinically relevant adverse treatment event and/or drug interaction treatment arm end study expect high patient assign comprehensive standardize educational plan compare usual care ( primary outcome ) . Patients experimental plan also expect commonly free relevant adverse event and/or drug interaction intermediate visit , present low number adverse treatment event , imply low cost medical contact , hospital admission , drug , present good HRQOL score , present less weekly treatment omission .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY The primary objective study verify whether comprehensive standardize educational plan follow significant reduction number adult patient epilepsy comorbidity present clinically relevant adverse treatment effect . Secondary objective include effect follow comprehensive standardize educational plan : - Reduction total number adverse treatment event - Reduction number medical contact - Improvement health-related quality patient 's life ( HRQOL ) - Reduction direct cost health care assistance - Improvement patient 's compliance The hypothesis test comprehensive standardize educational plan superior present modality adopt manage treatment safety clinical practice follow reason : - It raise level attention towards putative adverse effect drug currently take possible drug interaction - It help identify clinically relevant event onset prevent occurrence symptom sign lead medical contact hospital admission - It educate patient live treatment schedule represent best compromise term safety METHODS Study design . This randomize , control , open-label , pragmatic trial . Study population . Patients eligible inclusion identify among consecutively see outpatient service participate unit . Intervention . Patients fulfil inclusion/exclusion criterion randomize receive comprehensive standardize educational plan ( experimental arm ) usual care , ie management adverse event/drug interaction usually do clinical practice keep unit 's modality ( control arm ) . The comprehensive standardized educational plan consist discussion patient , available , caregiver follow point ( write summary make available : - The cause nature adverse event and/or drug interaction - The tolerability profile drug present schedule , illustrate simple list include common adverse event present decrease order frequency - The clinical manifestation ( ) associate current drug interaction ( ) - Any contraindication use over-the-counter drug potentially interfere current treatment schedule - The reason potential benefit suggest treatment change - An encouragement withdraw potentially interfere contraindicate drug compound unequivocally find efficacious specific case Study conduction . After sign informed consent form , eligible patient immediately randomize receive comprehensive standardize educational plan usual care . Patients assign experimental arm give appointment one-hour private meeting discuss item include comprehensive educational plan . The patient assign control arm manage do context usual care ambulatory visit . All patient see one , three six month admission whenever indicated management individual case . Outcomes . These include one primary number secondary outcome . The primary outcome define number patient free clinically relevant adverse treatment event and/or number drug interaction treatment arm end study . Secondary outcome include follow : - The number patient free clinically relevant adverse treatment event and/or drug interaction treatment arm intermediate visit - The mean median number adverse treatment event treatment arm , intermediate visit end study - The monetary cost medical contact , hospital admission , drug ; one-hour meeting patient assign experimental arm include cost . Costs calculate healthcare economy service Mario Negri Institute accord current national value . - Total HRQOL summary score change ( compare last follow-up admission visit ) - Number patient least weekly omission assign treatment schedule Randomization . A centralized randomization procedure adopt . Randomization perform access user-friendly , protect centralized database , proceed assignment experimental control arm verification appropriateness inclusion/exclusion criterion . To control center-related confounding , separate randomization list make available center . Blinding ( mask ) . For purpose study , treat evaluate physician represent different person . Given diversity two management policy , neither patient care physician involve administer intervention blind assigned arm . An attempt make blind physician assess outcome . Statistical analysis . The data analyze use SPSS-13 package PC . The statistical analysis plan include descriptive statistic compare baseline characteristic two population distribution treatment schedule , number type adverse event ( present baseline occur follow-up ) , propose change , along cost item ( medical contact , hospitalization , drug cost ) HRQOL score . For descriptive statistic , chi-square test , Student 's test , analysis variance ( ANOVA ) equivalent non parametric test use appropriate . The chi-square test also use test number patient free relevant adverse event end study ( primary end-point ) intermediate visit . The analysis primary end-point base intention-to-treat analysis include randomized patient . Repeated measure ANOVA use compare difference two treatment arm mean change number adverse event , number omit drug dos , total monetary cost , total HRQOL score follow-up visit ( applicable ) study end . Timing . The duration entire study 24 month follow distribution : - Months 1-3 : Protocol approval local unit ' ethic committee preparation electronic database - Months 4-15 : Patients ' enrolment - Months 16-21 : Completion follow-up - Months 22-24 : Data analysis scientific report An interim assessment recruitment rate perform end month 12 decide whether enrolment complete expect . If need , request make postpone patient ' enrolment end month 21 study completion end month 30 . Ethical aspect . Each eligible patient properly inform study aim , use diary , requirement meet visit . A summary sheet outline study objective conduct give patient part write informed consent form . The patient also instruct possibility withdraw study plausible reason without interference management his/her disease do clinical practice . The confidentiality data collect study purpose grant give access ( nominal username password ) person officially involve study conduction . The data manage without disclose patient ' identity .</detailed_description>
