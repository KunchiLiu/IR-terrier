	<brief_summary>Objective : The aim study assess efficacy web tutorial base case vignettes complementary tool teach literature critical assessment nursing student , term : 1 ) knowledge , 2 ) tutorial quality acceptability 3 ) student ' point view research participation . Participants : Nursing second-year student 3 university Paris ( Paris Descartes University , Paris Diderot University Paris 13 Nord ) . Design : A randomized control trial ass teach efficacy case vignette base tutorial compare tutorial . In order preserve minimal blinding participant , comparator basic passive teaching presentation internet . The student randomize two parallel group . They evaluate final case vignette , invite follow intervention evaluation . The allocation participant do computerized randomization list , sequence create independent statistician ratio 1 : 1 : 1 . Since student follow course different nursing institute university may different teach content organization , randomization stratify nurse institute . Allocation concealment provide statistician access randomization list . All participant receive individual mail link group dedicate website . In order preserve minimal blinding participant , comparator passive presentation participant inform intervention evaluate opportunity follow intervention evaluation . In parallel , group follow normally university course . Intervention : A case vignette clinical scenario base clinical practice . It ask clinical problem student answer read research article randomize clinical trial . Then answer question article related major methodological point randomize trial . All step available secure website . Outcomes : The primary endpoint student 's knowledge critical assessment randomize controlled trial . It measure student ' score evaluation case vignette multiple choice questionnaire . The secondary endpoint quality perception acceptance tutorial tutorial modify perception research participation . Responses range 5-point Likert scale . Potential interest : This study take place field nursing universitary teaching . Nursing student enter recently universitary education system enhance nurse research , emerge field France . The investigator hope complementary teaching tool enhance knowledge participation nurse research . Sample size expect : 506 participant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Statistical analysis : Qualitatives variable present number percentage participant miss data outcome . Quantitative variable present number percentage participant , mean , standard deviation range . Assymetrical variable present median interquartile range . Quantitative outcome compare group Fisher test linear mixed model . ( fixed effect allocation group random effect nurse institute take account similarity student institute ) . Qualitative outcome compare use mixed effect logistic regression model ( fixed effect allocation group random effect nurse institute take account similarity student institute ) . The data analysis carry 'intention-to treat analysis ' randomized participant . For primary outcome , miss data dealt multiple imputation method . Sensibility analysis use confirm result primary outcome . Two-tailed test apply standard level 5 % . The statistical analysis perform SAS 9.3 statistical software .</detailed_description>
