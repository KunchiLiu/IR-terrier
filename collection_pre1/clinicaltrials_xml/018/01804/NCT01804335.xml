	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , apply CD5789 cream 1 time day . You wash area . During first study visit , study staff select lesion apply cream . The study staff tell much cream apply . On Day 1 , study staff apply study drug half lesion . You apply study drug rest lesion study staff watch . In diary , study staff write time apply study drug . You must write information diary apply study drug home . On Week 1 visit , apply study drug clinic study staff watch . You use glove apply study drug thin film lesion . Be careful overlap healthy skin . You massage study drug gently skin .

On Day 1 : - Any skin lesion measure photographed . Your private area cover much possible , picture face take . - You skin biopsy check status disease . To perform skin biopsy , area numb anesthetic small amount skin remove small knife . The skin biopsy do apply study drug . - You tape strip measure inflammatory marker skin . Inflammatory marker may relate status disease . To tape stripping , small special piece tape apply 1 skin lesion area normal skin next . When tape lose stickiness collect study staff . - You EKG check heart function . - You ask much itch burn stinging sensation apply study drug . - If become pregnant , urine collect urine pregnancy test . At Weeks 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 : - Any skin lesion measure photograph . - You ask much itch burn stinging sensation apply study drug . At Weeks 4 8 , become pregnant , urine collect urine pregnancy test . Length Study : You may continue use study drug 12 week , long study doctor think best interest . You longer able use study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of-study visit . All sample collect study destroy study complete patient study . End-of-Study Visit : On last day apply study drug ( Week 12 ) , end-of-study visit : - You ask drug treatment may receive . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - Any skin lesion examine photograph . - Blood ( 2Â½ teaspoon ) draw routine test . test HIV and/or hepatitis . - Blood ( 1 teaspoon time ) drawn pharmacokinetic ( PK ) test 12 hour study drug apply home PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . - You EKG check heart function . - You skin biopsy check status disease . - You tape strip measure inflammatory marker skin . - If become pregnant , urine collect pregnancy test .
