	<brief_summary>The purpose Ohio Colorectal Cancer Prevention Initiative ( OCCPI ) reduce morbidity mortality due colorectal cancer ( CRC ) state Ohio . By identify individual high-risk CRC ( genetically predispose ) provide screen recommendation cancer risk reduction , OCCPI understand increase length life quality life diagnose CRC Ohio , well well prevent CRC others Ohio . Participants free tumor screen Lynch syndrome , may eligible free genetic test free genetic counseling part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lynch Syndrome : Lynch syndrome ( LS ) , previously know `` hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer '' , hereditary cancer syndrome cause majority hereditary CRC approximately 3 % CRC . LS significantly increase risk individual develop CRC lifetime . Individuals LS also increase risk develop extracolonic cancer , include endometrial , gastric , ovarian , upper urinary tract , small bowel , biliary tract , CNS , certain type skin cancer . Tumor study , include microsatellite instability ( MSI ) test immunohistochemical ( IHC ) analysis , provide information regard characteristic feature LS-associated tumor help target genetic testing . Given hereditary nature syndrome , screen patient newly diagnose CRC LS identify additional individual high-risk develop cancer . Study Aims : By develop CRC research infrastructure within state Ohio , OCCPI achieve follow specific aim : - Establish implement statewide universal screen protocol LS . - Elucidate prevalence hereditary CRC Ohio . - Provide screen recommendation high-risk individual CRC family , well local access genetic counseling . - Create CRC biorepository future research etiology CRC leftover sample CRC patient , well sample relative . With successful implementation OCCPI , knowledge gain facilitate adoption universal screen protocol LS Ohio creation statewide CRC biorepository use additional study cancer risk , prevention , screen , treatment survivorship . Study Procedures CRC EC participant : - You ask donate 2-3 tablespoon blood . - A small piece colorectal endometrial tumor obtain hospital surgery . - You ask contribute leftover sample ( tumor blood ) OCCPI biorepository ( sample bank ) help future research . Additionally , CRC participant ask donate saliva sample OCCPI biorepository . The sample keep securely lab OSU . Before sample use research , people research must get specific approval OCCPI Steering Committee possibly Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) OSU . The IRB responsible protect participant involve research study make sure research do safe ethical manner . - You ask complete questionnaire ask age , medical history , family history , lifestyle factor environmental exposure . It take one hour complete questionnaire complete home . - We test tumor feature LS ( MSI , IHC , methylation ) . - For CRC patient : tumor show feature LS OR diagnose age 50 OR family history CRC endometrial cancer OR synchronous metachronous CRC endometrial cancer , test blood gene cause LS , well gene cause hereditary cancer . - For endometrial cancer patient : tumor show feature LS , test blood gene cause LS , well gene cause hereditary cancer . - Some patient may tumor genetic testing . - If find LS another type hereditary cancer , offer free genetic counseling . - If find LS , at-risk relative offer free genetic counseling genetic testing . Study Procedures first-degree relative ( FDR ) CRC participant : The FDRs CRC study participant give opportunity contribute biorepository future research . - Family Member Consent Contact form provide CRC participant time enrollment distribute FDRs ( parent , sibling adult child ≥ 25 year ) . The FDRs mail sign form OSU . - After obtain permission contact FDRs , OSU mail biorepository consent form saliva kit return OCCPI biorepository . - The FDRs CRC study participant also invite complete baseline questionnaire . Length study : - The LS tumor screen portion OCCPI take 1-4 month . - If applicable , genetic test result ready additional 3-6 month . - Overall , participation LS screen portion OCCPI expect take 1 year . Most time spend wait result . Your active involvement take 15 minute day provide consent 60 minute complete questionnaire home .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Newly diagnose colorectal adenocarcinoma ( stage ) resection hospital Ohio 1/1/2013 12/31/2016 . For individual neoadjuvant treatment show complete response resection , tumor screening attempt original biopsy ( even occur 2012 ) long resection occur 1/1/2013 12/31/2016 . Many individual stage IV CRC resection ; therefore , tumor screening attempt original colon biopsy long primary diagnosis occur 1/1/2013 12/31/2016 . If metastatic CRC available biopsy ( liver lymph node metastasis ) , tumor screening attempt metastatic tissue . 2 . Newly diagnose endometrial cancer ( histology except sarcoma ) resection 1/1/2013 12/31/2016 OSU . 3 . All atrisk relative participant find LS . 4 . Firstdegree relative ( parent , sibling adult child ≥ 25 year age ) CRC participant LS . 1 . Prisoners . 2 . Individuals age 18 . 3 . Individuals must primary colorectal endometrial cancer , recurrence previous colorectal endometrial cancer .</criteria>
