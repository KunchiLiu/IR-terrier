	<brief_title>Effects Supplement Enriched Hydroxymethylbutyrate Vitamin D Muscle Strength Hip Fracture</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hip fracture cause substantial morbidity mortality elderly people . Nine month hip fracture , patient still poorer quality life compare control subject match age sex . After hip fracture , many patient fail return home previous state mobility . Acute hospital cost generate condition substantial , although cost rehabilitation special care long-term community even great . Patients hip fracture likely frail elderly , usually malnourish fracture occur . Moreover , physiological age accompanied functional loss change various organ system , include musculoskeletal system , progressive reduction muscle mass , call sarcopenia . Approximately 30 % muscle mass lose fifth eighth decade life percentage muscle loss reach 15 % per decade 70 year age . Having establish correlation loss muscle mass loss strength , sarcopenia associate risk functional disability twice men thrice woman . Hydroxymethylbutyrate ( HMB ) leucine metabolite produce small quantity ( 0.3-0.4 g/d ) . Leucine effect muscle metabolism appear due , part , HMB . In vitro experiment observe HMB attenuates proteolysis process inhibition various catabolic pathway could stimulate protein synthesis . There evidence administration HMB elderly result increase muscle strength functionality enhancement , compare control group . In elderly people , low level vitamin D associate , among others , decrease muscle strength , fall fracture . The elderly increase risk develop vitamin D deficiency due less sun exposure , decrease absorption change metabolism vitamin . Because muscle weakness clinical feature vitamin D deficiency , postulated deficiency could precipitate increase muscle weakness functional decline old people . Therefore , study raise possibility intervention consist high protein , high calorie oral nutritional supplement enrich HMB vitamin D effective standard high protein , high calorie oral nutritional supplement improve muscle strength .</detailed_description>
