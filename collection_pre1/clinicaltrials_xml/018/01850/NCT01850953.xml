	<brief_summary>The objective study determine mechanism varenicline , effective smoking cessation treatment , protect relapse . Varenicline administer smoker schizophrenia control smoker use randomized , double-blind , cross-over design . Smokers ask stop smoking overnight ; next day ability resist smoke assess laboratory smoking lapse paradigm . Measures tobacco craving , reinforcement withdrawal-related cognitive dysfunction correlate time lapse . The result could significant clinical implication identify mechanisms smoker schizophrenia risk relapse general population , lead development effective smoking cessation therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>One way facilitate medication development smoke cessation use human laboratory paradigm provide efficient , cost-effective mechanistic evaluation medication signal smoking behavior bridge pre-clinical study costly clinical trial . This study take advantage recent development validation smoke lapse procedure evaluate effect varenicline smoker without schizophrenia . We extend recent work varenicline relate effect reinforcement , crave cognition clinical outcome ( i.e. , lapse - strong predictor relapse ) . It pertinent study smoker schizophrenia smoke rate decline general population leave group of'hardcore ' smoker current smoke cessation strategy limit efficacy . The objective study determine effect varenicline versus placebo , time lapse , function craving , reinforcement cognitive dysfunction , smoker without schizophrenia . We hypothesize : 1 . Smokers schizophrenia reduced ability resist smoke placebo condition compare control ; secondarily , relate high level cognitive dysfunction abstinence . 2 . Varenicline increase ability resist smoke control schizophrenia smoker ; secondarily , mediate via effect cognition smoker schizophrenia , effect crave control smoker . The exploratory aim determine : 1 . Varenicline 's effect cue-reactivity smoker without schizophrenia relationship time lapse . 2 . Varenicline 's effect tobacco reinforcement relationship ad lib smoke lapse period The current study advance development tobacco addiction treatment follow way : 1 ) Identification mechanism varenicline facilitate abstinence different subtypes smoker ( schizophrenia vs. control ) critical improve treatment response . 2 ) Identification predictor relapse different subtypes smoker ( schizophrenia vs. control ) could guide future medication development effort . 3 ) Relating measure tobacco abstinence addiction collect laboratory proxy measure treatment outcome ( i.e. , smoke lapse ) provide validation evaluation medication paradigms useful cost-effective screening strategy . 4 ) Our approach could also use identify smoker risk tobacco abstinence symptom would benefit treatment target prominent aspect withdrawal . This could lead improved health outcome smoker .</detailed_description>
