	<detailed_description>- Hypothesis 1 : Reduced hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) outflow old men underlies reduce mass luteinizing hormone ( LH ) pulse , reduce men untreated OSA . The investigator aim test hypothalamic function examine decrement pulsatile LH secretion submaximally inhibitory dose selective GnRH-receptor antagonist , ganirelix , men untreated ( i.e . active ) treat OSA . This decrement regress age , significant reduction slope active OSA ( v treat OSA ) indicate disease attenuation . - Hypothesis 2 : Untreated OSA attenuate age-related erosion testosterone 's negative-feedback control LH . The investigator aim assess pituitary function quantitating LH secretion enforce androgen deprivation , men active treat OSA . Slopes obtain age regression compare . - Hypothesis 3 : Impaired Leydig-cell steroidogenesis cause hypoandrogenemia old men , effect untreated OSA human entirely unknown . Hence investigator aim assess testicular function examine testosterone secretion experimentally control pulsatile i.v . infusion recombinant human LH maximal GnRH-receptor blockade , men active treat CPAP . Slopes compare . Accordingly immediate goal characterize four hypothalamic , pituitary , testicular feedback-dependent control LH testosterone secretion determine primary mechanism ( ) occur ( ) drive ( ) alteration loci , give subject . To meet challenge , investigator implement innovative comprehensive analytical platform , correctly embody time-lagged , dose-dependent nonlinear signaling among GnRH , LH testosterone . To ensure necessary age continuum , volunteer whose age span 30-70 year study 3-4 men per decade life ( 16 men total ) . To assess disease effect , investigator compare age regression men active OSA ( sham therapy ) men treat real CPAP , feasible , convenient sample 16 individually age- BMI- matched ( ±2.5 year ±2.5 kg/m2 ) normal control select large cohort 100 men identify Rochester -Minnesota ( MN ) . The within subject cross-over design control possible know unknown confounders , however BMI also restrict exclude men diabetes mellitus ( HbA1c ) . Study Subject Recruitment : 16 men OSA recruit age 30-70 year , use entry criterion age range utilized generate preliminary data 42 . Additionally , body mass index restrict 30-35 kg/m2 . Volunteers recruit clinic University California , Los Angeles ( UCLA ) -affiliated medical center Harbor Santa Monica advertisement . Study Design : Randomized sham-controlled cross-over trial , period 3 month duration one month washout . This design replicate recently complete study . Another comparable study recently complete California ( elsewhere USA ) involve 6 month sham treatment , many 1105 adult recruit severe OSA . Dynamic Testing Male Gonadal Axis : Enrolled subject undergo repetitive sample peripheral blood ( 1.5 mL ) every 10-min 5 hr 0800-1300 h [ 2 outpatient protocol ] , 15 hr overnight ( 2200 - 1300h ) 22 hr overnight ( 1500 - 1300h ) . Polysomnography ( 2200-0600h ) perform 2 inpatient visit . A terminal i.v . bolus injection GnRH ( 100 ng/kg ) give 1100h 4 visit calibrate endogenous GnRH response . Ganirelix ( saline ) give 2000h 1500h : hypothalamic function test partial ( submaximal ) ganirelix blockade endogenous GnRH . Oral medication ( Δ ) placebo except pituitary test response LH androgen depletion enforce ketoconazole ( KTCZ ) adrenal rescue dexamethasone ( DEX ) . Here , KTCZ ( 1000mg ) DEX ( 0.75mg ) give 2000h , KTCZ ( 400mg ) 0800h DEX ( 0.75mg ) 1300h . Testis function assess testosterone response fix exogenous LH stimulus : 6 pulse rh LH ( 18.75 IU ) every 2 hr . 2300h maximal ganirelix blockade endogenous LH . Statistical Analysis : The effect age disease mechanistic outcome assess construct repeat measure mixed model include OSA ( treat versus untreated ) , age OSA*age interaction . The statistical significance interaction term indicate whether disease process ( OSA ) alters age relate decline outcome ( i.e . assess difference slope two condition ) . The within-subject design reduce variance increase power . Assuming suitable convenient control group assemble Rochester MN , investigator additionally construct between-subject mixed model disease effect untreated OSA versus normal control , treatment effect compare treat OSA versus normal control . The former affirm disease effect latter whether treatment 3 month CPAP fully reverse deficit normality . Power Analysis : Preliminary data suggest untreated OSA attenuate testosterone feedback , result impaired unleashing LH pulse . Under ketoconazole castration , correlation LH pulse frequency age normal men -0.50 . A sample size 16 men 80 % power two-tailed á=0.05 detect attenuation correlation 1.00 . By way comparison , investigator observe one-third great attenuation correlation 1.35 . Hence , power adequate . This estimate conservative since within-subject study design , reduce variability , incorporate ketoconazole-induced testosterone depletion paradigm ass pituitary function sharpen age regression variability individual 's blood testosterone concentration reduce . The latter verify normal men , also true men OSA . Outcomes : To appraise GnRH outflow ( Aim 1 ) , response variable ganirelix-suppressed ( analytically reconstruct ) basal LH secretion . To assess gonadotrope responsiveness , pertinent end point mass LH secrete follow exogenous GnRH stimulus . The degree feedback unleashing infer degree elevation LH pulse frequency elicit androgen withdrawal ( Aim 2 ) . And , Leydig-cell sensitivity define analytical reconstruction rate testosterone secretion achieve response last two six ( pseudosteady-state ) pulse recombinant human LH ( Aim 3 ) . Other Outcomes : GnRH outflow reconstruct simultaneously calculate hypothalamic pituitary testosterone feedback , previously describe . These data analyze mixed model describe statistical analysis ( ) . Pulsatile LH secretion aligns slow wave sleep onset puberty , implicate sleep architecture time puberty . The investigator perform analysis describe , compare ( Student 's t-test ) proportion LH pulse occur slow wave versus non-slow wave sleep , normalized amount time spend sleep stage . The final additional outcome examine total testosterone secretion overnight control condition first phase study , separately combine finding original 18 men describe preliminary data . Anticipated Alternate Results : It expect show OSA impairs testosterone feedback ( i.e . pituitary dysfunction ) , specifically androgen depletion ( Aim 2 ) , increase LH pulse frequency reduce basal LH secretion . Although It postulate reduced basal LH secretion due attenuate testosterone feedback pituitary , unexpected plausible alternate find would alter GnRH outflow responsible - It assess Aim 1 grade GnRH receptor blockade . Additionally , due recent analytical innovation , investigator also reconstruct hypothalamic versus pituitary feedback effect testosterone ( Aim 2 ) whilst simultaneously assess GnRH outflow ( Aim 1 ) . This particularly pertinent since preliminary data brain permeant versus brain impermeant androgen receptor blockade suggest specific brain effect . Specific brain effect plausible intermittent hypoxia OSA already know alter neurocognition . Another inexplicable find relative reduction LH OSA seem great correspond fall testosterone , might suggest relatively enhanced Leydig cell responsiveness . Indeed , intermittent hypoxia increase testosterone production primary rat Leydig cell culture response human chorionic gonadotropin ( hCG ) , effect OSA testicular steroidogenesis human know . Aim 3 address possibility first time use physiological rh LH probe . Testosterone secretion expect increase CPAP . If , presence preserve enhanced Leydig cell responsiveness rh LH ( Aim 3 ) , would motivate future long duration study CPAP . Potential Problems Alternate Strategies : investigator anticipate recruitment problem since study require enrol single individual month 16 month , however recruitment could broaden Westwood UCLA-affiliated clinic , need . If cross-over design prove problematic , investigator convert 3 month parallel group study 32 men without loss power . The study include run-in period wherein CPAP compliance monitor direct CPAP machine download subject exclude non-compliant , since intensive endocrine test perform 3 month establish therapy . Our study dependent upon able include convenient control group control within ±2.5 year ±2.5 kg/m2 case . Finding 16 control 100 men age 18-80 year , BMI 18-35 kg/m2 without significant illness ( include diabetes mellitus ) identify possible . If , investigator loosen match criterion ( double interval ±5.0 year kg/m2 ) , simultaneously match 2 control every case . A problem might LH testosterone assay align , however investigator test directly assay single pooled sample individual ( 16 men total ) testosterone tandem mass spectroscopy LH immunoassay external standard ensure comparability .</detailed_description>
