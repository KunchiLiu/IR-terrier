	<brief_summary>Patients brain metastasis candidate treatment stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) potential study participant . SRS delivers high-energy , precisely-focused radiation brain metastasis shrink tumor , standard-of-care patient tumor . Oxygen enhance damaging effect radiation tumor cell . Hyperbaric oxygen ( HBO ) therapy increase oxygen level kinds tissue , include tumor . The purpose trial study whether feasible treat patient HBO prior receive SRS , give time constraint treat sequentially HBO SRS . Patients undergo HBO treatment follow placement Gill-Thomas-Cosman head frame transport , via stretcher , receive SRS . The transfer placement head frame need complete within 15minute time frame . The trial 's secondary objective determine whether effect outcomes quality life . As part study participation patient ask complete quality life questionnaire well mini mental status questionnaire . These do prior treatment follow appointment throughout next 3 year participate study . Patients give option participate optional bio marker blood draw study would require patient blood draw three time point , pre-treatment , day treatment first follow visit .</brief_summary>
