	<brief_summary>Autologous wash homogenized fat micrograft harvest patient 's front abdominal wall enrich adipose-derived regenerative cell ( ADRC ) derive enzyme-treatment portion harvest fat . Fat tissue micrograft mixed ADRC administer one-time endoscopically submucosal layer urethra eye control . This single arm study control . All patient receive cell therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Fat tissue obtainment . Subjects undergo liposuction local anesthesia . In procedure , Ringer 's solution anesthetic lidocaine vasoconstrictor adrenaline infuse adipose compartment minimize blood loss contamination tissue peripheral blood cell . 15 minute later hollow blunt-tipped 3 mm cannula introduce subcutaneous space small ( 0.5 cm ) incision . The cannula attach syringe gentle suction move adipose compartment , mechanically disrupt fat tissue . Aspirate volume - approximately 150 cc . Procedure time - 30 minute . ADRC isolation . Aspirated fat tissue place sterile tube transport medium deliver laboratory within 15 minute . To isolate ADRC , part lipoaspirate ( approximately 100 cc ) wash extensively equal volume phosphate-buffered saline digest collagenase . After enzyme activity neutralization decompose fat tissue eliminate ADRC wash 3 time saline . Cells divide 3 portion . First portion use counting , viability sterility assessment . Second portion prepare freeze liquid nitrogen . Third portion mix fat micrograft . Fat tissue enrich micrograft preparation . Obtained fat tissue ( approximately 20-30 cc ) wash repeatedly . Aspirated fat settle syrinx place vertical position , liquid fraction eliminate . Syringes fat fill Ringer 's solution procedure settlement repeat 3-5 time . Washed fat place metallic mesh mash use metallic spatula . Homogenized fat mixed prepare ADRC collect syringe injection . Ratio fat micrograft/fat ADRC estimate accord aspirate volume usually form 1:10 . For example , ADRC obtain 100 cc fat tissue mix 10 cc fat micrograft . Fat micrograft preparation also possible Puregraft System ( Cytori Therapeutics Inc ) - close disposable system fat tissue selective washing . Periurethral injection fat micrograft enrich ADRC Urethra puncture several time circle-wise bulbomembranous region depth 5 mm endoscopic vision 0.5-1 mL fat micrograft enrich ADRC injected time . Total volume solution inject - approximately 8 mL . After fat micrograft inject , urethral balloon catheter place removed following day .</detailed_description>
