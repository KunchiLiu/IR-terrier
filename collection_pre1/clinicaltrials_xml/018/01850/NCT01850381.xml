	<detailed_description>Background The investigational drug GM6028 synthetic oligopeptide contain 6 amino acid sequence identical one active site human Motoneuronotrophic factor ( MNTF ) , also refer GM6 study . MNTF novel human endogenous developmental stage neurotrophin nervous system specific human chromosome location . The investigator ' preclinical animal study show intravenously inject GM608 able penetrate blood-brain barrier enter brain . GM608 show neuroprotection variety vitro animal model numerous CNS disease include ischemic stroke , spinal cord injury , Parkinsons Disease ( PD ) , ALS , MS , Alzheimer Huntington Disease . In particular , MPTP 6-OHDA mouse model PD show GM608 neuroprotective effect . GM608 also enhance neuron cell survival significantly CSF patient Huntington disease , MS , Stroke , Parkinson , Alzheimer ALS . This pilot trial design test proof principle , i.e . determine 2-week treatment agent restore nonfunctioning nigral dopaminergic neuron PD 3month period , placebo-treated arm expect little worsen total UPDRS score compare baseline . A Phase 1 Clinical Trial Study complete . The Phase 1 Trial primary objective determine safety tolerability establish pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic property GM608 0.5 , 1.5 , 5.0 mg/kg administer single bolus intravenous dose human subject 3 consecutive daily dos GM608 high safe tolerate dose 5.0 mg/kg . The Phase 1 study establish 3 consecutive daily dose 5.0 mg/kg GM602 safe tolerate . Mechanism Action Motoneuronotrophic factor ( MNTF ) highly specific human nervous system . It express rapidly first trimester human fetal development , peak week nine . MNTF developmental stage regulatory ( antisense ) neuro-signaling molecule bind perfectly specific receptor . Using In Silico Analysis , Genervon identify develop drug candidate one active site MNTF , analog six amino acid name GM608 . In investigator ' test efficacy Parkinson disease MPTP 6-OHDA animal model , GM608 demonstrate dose dependent attenuation PD mouse 20 mg/kg show efficacious . Behavioral , biochemical histological analysis demonstrate attenuation illustrate unique effect GM608 PD . These data suggest GM608 effective mouse model PD follow IV injection may potential treatment PD patient . In investigator ' vitro study Parkinson disease , treatment wortmannin ( PI3K inhibitor ) abrogate protective effect GM608 SH-SY5Y cell subject salsolinol exposure 24 hour . The result suggest GM608 may function phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) pathway important pathway neuronal disease . Although neuroprotective mechanism animal study well understood , investigator hypothesize GM608 respond specific distress signal anywhere human nervous system common underlie mechanism trigger specific pathway ( ) , possibly PI3 pathway pathway protect neural tissue increase decrease specific gene ( ) expression . This single-center , prospective , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled pilot study , involve 6 subject dopaminergic medication ( i.e . levodopa dopamine agonist ) . Subjects randomized 2:1 one two treatment arm : ( 1 ) 4 subject receive i.v . injection GM608 ( 2 ) 2 subject receive match placebo . Progression clinical PD assess use UPDRS 12 week . Safety tolerability also compare treated placebo group . There 2 week active treatment , follow 10 week assessment without active treatment . During 2-week active treatment phase , subject receive one IV bolus injection day three time week 2 week total six injection . Subjects evaluate UPDRS screening , baseline , end week 2 ( visit 6 dosing ) , 6 , 12 . The study duration subject 12 week .</detailed_description>
