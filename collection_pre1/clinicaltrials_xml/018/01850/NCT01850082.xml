	<brief_summary>Coronary artery bypass grafting ( CABG ) common major surgical procedure United States 300,000 case perform year . To restore blood flow heart , vascular conduit another part body procure create bypass around critically block coronary artery . The left internal thoracic artery conduit choice CABG due superior long-term patency . However , almost patient refer CABG require additional graft provide complete revascularization . This necessitate harvest vessel , commonly saphenous vein use almost ubiquitously contemporary CABG average two vein graft per CABG procedure . In last 10 year , Endoscopic Vein Harvesting ( EVH ) recommend preferred method traditional open harvesting technique ( OVH ) provide minimally invasive approach . However , recent investigation indicate potential reduce long-term bypass graft patency bad clinical outcome EVH . The long term impact EVH clinical outcome never investigate large scale use definitive , adequately power , prospective Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) long-term follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>CSP # 588 - REGROUP randomize , intent-to-treat , two-arm , parallel design , multicenter study . Cardiac Surgery Programs Veterans Affairs Medical Centers ( VAMC ) expertise perform EVH OVH invite participate study . Subjects require elective urgent CABG use cardiopulmonary bypass use least one SVG screen enrollment use establish inclusion/exclusion criterion . Enrolled Subjects randomize one two arm ( EVH OVH ) experience vein harvester identify assign . Intraoperative assessment collect post-operative assessment complete 24 hour post-surgery . Additional assessment complete time discharge 30-day post-surgery date subject still hospital . Assessment leg wound complication complete time discharge six-week post-surgery . Telephone follow-ups occur three-month interval post-surgery participate site decommission end trial period ( would approximately 4.5 year site initiation ) . For long-term MACE outcome , passive follow MACE event use VA database ( CPRS , VASQIP ) perform centrally Study Chair 's office another 2 year .</detailed_description>
