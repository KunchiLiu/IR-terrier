	<brief_summary>Recent data highlight role vascularity melasma recent study show interest target vascular component pulse dye laser . The Dual Yellow laser copper bromide laser emit dual wavelength ( green 511nm yellow 578 nm ) . This laser target vascular pigment component melasma . A preliminary study show efficacy excellent tolerability treatment melasma . This study require however confirm comparative study versus reference treatment . Main objective To compare efficacy melasma 6 month post treatment Dual Yellow Laser precede 1 month kilnman trio kilnman trio monotherapy 3 month intra-patient study . Secondary objective - To study frequency PPI . - Compare rate extent recurrence 6 month completion treatment . - To study occurrence possible adverse effect . - Compare effectiveness Dual Yellow laser kilnman trio monotherapy S12 ( end treatment ) . - To study patient satisfaction effectiveness tolerability study treatment . Methods Monocentric prospective interventional randomize split face comparative study experimental treatment versus reference treatment . Intervention 1 . Visit Selection Patients select present consultation department dermatology University Hospital Nice . Participation offer patient correspond selection criterion study . 2 . Visit V0 : Inclusion early treatment After minimum 15 day , patient begin study . This ensure patient sign informed consent . An initial clinical evaluation melasma calculation MASI score standardize photograph ( see chapter 'assessment ' ) make . An examination confocal microscopy vivo realize . All patient receive treatment stabilize kilnman trio four week . In week prior Visit 1 , side face receive laser treatment determine randomisation . 3 . Visit V1 : ( Week 4 ) Clinical evaluation melasma calculation MASI score photograph make . Possible side effect ( include PPI ) note . The next trio treat depigmenting kilnman trio another 8 week . The contralateral side receive first laser session . Given result analysis intention treat , occurrence serious side effect result discontinuation treatment monitoring continue assessment . 4 . Visit V2 : ( week 6 ) Clinical evaluation melasma calculation MASI score photograph make . Possible side effect ( include PPI ) note . The laser side receive second session . Patients continue application cream contralateral side . 5 . Visit V3 ( week 9 ) Clinical evaluation melasma calculation MASI score photograph make . Possible side effect ( include PPI ) note . The laser side receive third session.Patients continue application cream contralateral side . 6 . Visit V4 ( week 12 ) Clinical evaluation melasma calculation MASI score photograph make . Possible side effect ( include PPI ) note . The laser side receive fourth final session . Patients continue application cream contralateral side 4 week . 7 . Visit V5 : ( week 18 ) Clinical evaluation melasma calculation MASI score photograph make . Possible side effect ( include PPI ) note . An assessment vivo confocal laser realize . 8 . Visit V6 : ( week 24 ) Clinical evaluation melasma calculation MASI score photograph make . Possible side effect ( include PPI ) note . An assessment vivo confocal laser realize . 9 . Visit V7 ( final week 36 ) : Clinical evaluation melasma calculation MASI score photograph make . Possible side effect ( include PPI ) note . An assessment vivo confocal laser realize . The evaluation safety patient satisfaction perform use visual analog scale . The primary endpoint MASI score , score approve assessment melasma treatment .</brief_summary>
