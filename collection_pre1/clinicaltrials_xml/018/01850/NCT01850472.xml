	<detailed_description>The purpose research study investigate brain process emotion , way process affect behavior . Specifically , hypothesize individual difference reward responsiveness correlate differential activation mesolimbic region brain predict future wellbeing follow-up interview . Participating study involve two session 7.5 hour . In present observational study , participant expose experimental procedure . Visit 1 take 4.5 hour , 12pm 4:30pm . The visit take place Center Depression , Anxiety Stress McLean . During visit , clinical interviewer conduct diagnostic SCID interview ensure participant qualify take part research study . Participants complete several task . These task include several different `` game-like '' situation arithmetic riddle , simple require participant work hard remain alert extended period time . The goal game earn much money avoid lose money . Participants respond ( press keyboard button ) quickly accurately . These task intend assessment tool , form therapy intervention . In addition , test participant ' ability keep hand cold water . Participants also ask provide blood ( via saline IV ) saliva sample different time session , also conduct urine drug pregnancy test . The IV place total around 3 hour , use reduce discomfort multiple blood draw . Visit 2 take place McLean Imaging Center McLean Hospital . During first part session , fMRI scanner take structural picture brain anatomy . Next , additional image obtain participant complete several different `` game-like '' task , similar task perform visit 1 . Again , task intend assessment tool , form therapy intervention . The whole fMRI session last 2.5 hour ; participant spend 1.5 hour fMRI machine , half-an-hour completing questionnaire provide saliva sample . Prior fMRI scan , another urine sample obtain check drug may interfere experiment . After second study session complete , participant re-contacted internet every four week total six month , complete questionnaire . At end six month , participant ask return McLean complete in-person interview . This follow-up period purely observational intend ass health outcome , intervention study .</detailed_description>
