	<brief_summary>This first-time-in-man study mainly design assess safety tolerability AADvac1 treatment Alzheimer 's disease . AADvac1 vaccine direct pathologically modify Alzheimer tau protein main constituent neurofibrillary tangle ( NFTs ) , intend disease-modifying treatment Alzheimer 's disease , i.e . halt progress . As study Phase I study focused tolerability safety , efficacy assess exploratory manner .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Safety Study AADvac1 , Tau Peptide-KLH-Conjugate Active Vaccine Treat Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AADvac1 candidate therapeutic vaccine Alzheimer 's disease target misfolded tau protein , common denominator neurofibrillary pathology . Based preclinical result , intervention expect reduce number neurofibrillary tangle , remove hyperphosphorylated tau protein reduce amount oligomerized insoluble pathological tau brain , halt spread neurofibrillary pathology brain , thus prevent associate cognitive decline . The vaccine 's antigenic determinant synthetic peptide derive tau protein sequence , couple keyhole limpet hemocyanin ( KLH ) use aluminum hydroxide ( Alhydrogel ) adjuvant . At present AADvac1 intend active immunotherapy patient diagnose Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . Patients receive 3 - 6 immunization dos ; raise titer therapeutic antibody possible benefit treatment extend beyond duration study . Because central role pathological misfolded tau protein etiology AD , vaccine expect effective active passive immunotherapy aim eliminate amyloid β plaque clinically investigate far .</detailed_description>
