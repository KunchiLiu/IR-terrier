	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether Adipose Derived Stem Cells effective treatment Premature Ovarian Failure ( POF ) . Stem cell transplantation report rescue ovarian function pre-clinical mouse model chemotherapy-induced POF ; however , maintain survival transplant cell human ovarian tissue enable POF patient regain ovary function long-term achieve successful pregnancy remain troublesome issue . In study investigator aim determine whether CD29+/CD44+ human Adipose Derived Stem Cells could later enable ovary produce mature oocyte .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects ADSC Therapy Women With POF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study explore therapeutic potency adipose derived stem cell ( ADSC ) transplantation premature ovarian failure ( POF ) woman underwent Autologous fat transplantation . The serum patient keep sent laboratory test surgery . 100ml fat harvest abdomen POF patient use abdominal fat abortion . And ADSC isolate cultured vitro use autologous serum . The biomarkers ADSC , CD29 CD44 , detect ADSC culture use Flow cytometry detection . The ADSC transplant directly bilateral ovary cell reach density 5-10Ã—106 . The clinical condition patient examine 1 , 2 , 4 8 week transplantation . Ovarian function evaluate follicle diameter sexual hormone level . The follicle number count radiology data keep future analysis . To ensure high rate pregnancy , intercourse medical guidance may suggest hormone replacement treatment may take help patient conceive . Main Outcome Measure ( ) : Serum FSH , LH , E2 level , recurrence Menstruation , Antral follicle diameter , pregnancy .</detailed_description>
