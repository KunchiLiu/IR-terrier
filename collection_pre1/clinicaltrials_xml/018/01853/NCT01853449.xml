	<brief_summary>`` Dyspnea '' refers awareness breathe discomfort typically experienced exercise health disease . In various participant population , dyspnea predictor disability death ; contributes exercise intolerance adverse health-related quality-of-life . It follow alleviate dyspnea improve exercise tolerance among principal goal disease management . Nevertheless , effective management dyspnea activity-limitation remain elusive goal many healthcare provider current strategy aim reverse underlie chronic disease partially successful regard . Thus , research aim identify dyspnea-specific medication complement exist therapy management exertional symptom timely clinically relevant . The purpose study test hypothesis single-dose inhalation fentanyl citrate ( mu-opioid receptor antagonist ) improve perception dyspnea strenuous exercise healthy , young men presence external thoracic restriction . To end , investigator plan compare effect inhale 0.9 % saline placebo inhale fentanyl citrate ( 250 mcg ) detail assessment neural respiratory drive ( diaphragm EMG ) , ventilation , breathe pattern , dynamic operating lung volume , contractile respiratory muscle function , cardio-metabolic function dyspnea ( sensory intensity affective response ) symptom-limited , high-intensity , constant-work-rate cycle exercise test without external thoracic restriction healthy , men age 20-40 year .</brief_summary>
