	<brief_summary>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) common visual impairment person 50 year age . It estimate 1 3 individual 75 year age 1 30 individual 52 year age affect AMD . The deficit visual function result disease affect central retina debilitating , individual lose ability carry many daily activity require resolve fine spatial detail . The investigator 's previous study show train oculomotor control exercise significantly increase read speed patient AMD . In proposed study , investigator examine whether training exercise effective practice home . In Phase 1 , investigator develop standardized user-friendly , Web-based platform allow patient easily self-administer training exercise . The software platform design automatically choose appropriate exercise base patient 's previous performance , run train exercise , collect performance data universal patient data file . In Phase 2 , platform test two setting : standard clinical rehabilitation practice patient 's home . Reading outcomes two setting compare . The investigator recruit 60 patient per year three year Phase 2 study . Half patient assign Clinic Training Group , half assign At-home Training Group . For patient , three assessment take : baseline , 1 month , 2 month train . The investigator compare read outcome assess role feedback versus role frequent available practice . Because extensive cost clinical resource require vision rehabilitation , critical determine whether train program make less expensive , effective , self-trained . If investigator demonstrate utility at-home practice , clinical facility therapist ' time make available activity require face-to-face contact</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In propose study , investigator examine whether training exercise effective practice home . There two specific aim project : Aim # 1 ( Year 1 ) : develop web-based meta program administer training exercise . For convenience , proposal , investigator refer platform PAECT ( Platform Administering Eye movement Control Training ) . The PAECT meta program incorporate exercise investigator develop validated course previous Merit Review grant ( Seiple , Szlyk et al. , 2005 , 2011 ) . The PAECT platform design allow patient easily run train exercise home practice convenience . The PAECT employ executive component keep track exercise practice record performance . Each time subject open platform , choose exercise subject base upon previous training performance . The development software design hardware interface administer system take place first year project . This do series software/hardware iteration base upon feedback derive direct patient test system . The investigator recruit ten patient AMD test comment system phase project . Aim # 2 ( Years 2-4 ) . To compare effect PAECT train read outcomes two train situation : ( 1 ) . train do clinic feedback performance provide trained low-vision therapist , ( 2 ) train do at-home expand opportunity practice exercise , therapist feedback . Patients assign one two group : Patients Group 1 ( `` Clinical '' ) undergo weekly two-hour training session three month use software/hardware system . This training conduct low-vision clinic use PAECT , feedback performance provide trained low-vision therapist . Patients Group 2 ( `` At-home '' ) practice exercise home use PAECT system three-month period . The subject encourage use system often possible , less two hour per week . Sixty patient ( 30 clinical set 30 home ) test three year .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients diagnosis retinal disease affect central visual field ( e.g. , nonexudative `` dry '' AMD ) central scotoma visual acuity less equal 20/70 great equal 20/400 ( test eye ) , include study . The presence central scotoma eccentric viewing confirm use OPKO OCT/SLO microperimeter . The investigator 's intent include subject base upon patient 's functional characteristic ( e.g. , eccentric viewing ) . Patients major ophthalmologic neurologic disease choroidal neovascularization ( `` wet '' AMD ) moderate severe medium opacity cognitive impairment exclude . Patients ' disease status monitor throughout study .</criteria>
