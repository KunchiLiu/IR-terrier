	<detailed_description>The purpose study investigate safety six different commercially use Gadolinium-containing contrast agent . In order get good view internal organ brain , joint body region contrast agent contain Gadolinium often administer magnetic resonance imaging . Gadolinium-containing contrast agent introduce 1980s , presently many different product common use . Although agent well tolerate , 2006 report patient severe renal failure undergo magnetic resonance contrast imaging develop sign rare condition know Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis ( NSF ) . NSF extremely rare disease predominantly report patient severe kidney impairment , acute kidney insufficiency due hepatorenal syndrome ( kidney failure patient advance chronic liver disease ) patient acute kidney insufficiency , recently soon expect liver transplantation . In order collect additional clinical data global scale across different agent common use , study request European Medicines Agency investigate whether Gadolinium human bone skin retain long time administration Gadolinium-containing contrast agent . It recommend analyse bone skin sample patient undergo hip knee replacement . Therefore , study develop evaluate Gadolinium retention patient renal function range stable severely impaired renal function previously receive six different contrast agent within magnetic resoÂ¬nance contrast imaging procedure undergo hip knee replacement surgery . For study patient administer research medication . Participating site locate Germany , Italy , Poland , Spain , Turkey , USA , Japan Republic Korea .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Main Patient schedule hip knee replacement A minimum 3 month elapse Gadolinium contrast agent ( GdCA ) dose schedule hip knee replacement . Patient belong one follow subgroup respect number GdCA dose receive status renal function : 1. patient stable severe renal impairment ( eGFR &lt; 30 ml/min/ 1.73 m2 ) receive one GdCA injection standard dose ( 0.025 mmol per kg body weight Gadoxetic acid 0.1 mmol per kg body weight agent ) 2. patient stable severe renal impairment ( eGFR &lt; 30 ml/min/ 1.73 m2 ) receive one injection GdCA 3. patient stable moderate renal impairment ( eGFR within range 30 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 ) receive one GdCA injection standard dose ( 0.025 mmol per kg body weight Gadoxetic acid 0.1 mmol per kg body weight agent ) 4. patient stable moderate renal impairment ( eGFR within range 30 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 ) receive one injection GdCA 5. patient stable renal function ( eGFR &gt; 60 ml/min /1.73 m2 ) receive one GdCA injection standard dose ( 0.025 mmol per kg body weight Gadoxetic acid 0.1 mmol per kg body weight agent ) 6. patient stable renal function ( eGFR &gt; 60 ml/min /1.73 m2 ) receive one injection GdCA . Main Patient receive different GdCAs . Patient receive intraarticular GdCA per noni.v . route . Patient receive investigational product participate clinical trial within 30 day prior enrol study .</criteria>
