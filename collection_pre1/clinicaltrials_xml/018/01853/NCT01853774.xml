	<brief_summary>The purpose study test effectiveness two-phase intervention use `` community-to-clinic navigator '' guide individual especially hard-to-reach , multicultural , underinsured population primary care clinic , subsequently , track effect intervention completion colorectal cancer ( CRC ) screen clinic . A cost-effectiveness analysis lay foundation implementation dissemination research . Aim 1 : Test effectiveness community group education + tailor navigation versus community group education increase clinic attendance among low-income , multicultural Arizona resident , age 50 75 yr . Hypothesis 1 : Individuals receive group education class + tailor navigation show high rate clinic attendance receive group education . * As separate critical step make clinic appointment , investigator examine effect follow screening , use initial group assignment control variable analysis . Patients make clinic appointment receive referral screening tailor navigation usual care . Aim 2 : Track outcome Phase I intervention CRC screen test completion among low-income , multicultural Arizona resident age 50 75 year attend clinic . Hypothesis 2 : Individuals receive group class tailor navigation Phase I high rate CRC screen test completion receiving class , ( however outcome primarily due clinic attendance ) . Aim 3 : Determine cost-effectiveness phase intervention increase CRC screen completion among low-income , multicultural Arizona resident age 50 75 year . Exploratory Aim 4 : Examine level program dissemination community clinic final screening use RE-AIM model . Research Question 2 : What degree Reach , Efficacy , Adoption , Implementation , Maintenance community-to-clinic navigation , clinic-to-screening outcome ?</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design overview : This study employ 2-phase experimental , randomized design test community clinic navigation intervention : ( 1 ) increase attendance primary care clinic ( Phase I ) , ( 2 ) track CRC screening among visit clinic ( Phase II ) . The investigator recruit non-adherent individual multicultural community sit low-income zip code Phoenix Arizona metropolitan area . In Phase I , community site randomize either group education ( GE ) group education plus tailored navigation ( GE +TN ) increase attendance primary care clinic . In Phase II , individual complete clinic appointment ( Phase I ) receive standard care ( provider prompt , navigation call patient ) clinic . Phase I bring individual primary care system ( clinic attendance ) , Phase II follow CRC screen completion ( either stool-based colonoscopy ) . An accelerated plan initiate individual identify high risk CRC , refer colonoscopy , realistically evaluate effect intervention real-world condition , include range patient risk profile set . Recruitment , intervention , data collection material develop English Spanish review Cultural Community Advisory Board ( CCAB ) cultural fit across multicultural population low-income participant . Intervention detail : Group education ( Phase I ) : Groups assemble educational class baseline survey complete community site . The curriculum 60 minute class include : - general information cancer risk , - specific risk factor CRC , - brief review dietary physical activity guideline , - stool blood test : purpose , preparation , procedure ( emphasis fecal occult blood test -- FOBT -- FIT test ) , - requirement reason annual testing , - meaning result , importance follow-up positive test , - instruction sample kit discussion - colonoscopy discussion , - preventative potential polyp remove , - colonoscopy preparation , - anesthesia , - guideline regard use colonoscopy primary screen tool individual high risk , test positive stool-based screening discuss Tailored navigation ( TN ) Phase I : Participants randomize group receive GE + TN intervention call within 5 day completion class encourage schedule appointment nearby identify clinic . Trained , culturally sensitive navigator navigate participant individual barrier concern , use tailor set response message library ( multi-theoretical basis ) develop co-PI 's previous research ( R21CA100566 ; PI : Menon &amp; R01NR8425 ; PI : Menon ) . Calls continue , total 5 within 8-week period ( less , attendance clinic and/or adherence screening obtain ) . In whichever call become final , Tracking Questions administer assess status clinic attendance reason schedule keep clinic appointment ( data collect end 8 week non-navigated control group participant ) . Tailored navigation ( TN ) Phase II utilize full message library assist patient overcome barrier care , negotiate healthcare system , access quality care . Within clinic , exist train , staff member ( study navigator ) follow patient attend clinic appointment . Although patient navigator vary site , primary role clinic-based navigator include connect patient resource support system ; assist communication clinic provider staff ; streamline appointment paperwork ; help patient identify access financial service , basic counsel psychosocial issue fear , anxiety , appropriate social service ; track interaction outcomes . Our TN cover component propose study . Calls continue total 5 within 8-week period . Control condition clarification . In Phase I , participant control arm study receive 3 call design support data collection tracking , receive navigation message . Call 1 : 1-2 week initial clinic visit verify contact information ; Call 2 : week 5-6 inquire clinic appointment make kept schedule data collection call week 8 ( Call 3 ) . Call 3 ( early , clinic attend ) utilize Tracking survey document clinic attendance reason non-attendance . During call appointment make kept , clinic name provider visit document , patient follow Phase II . Data Collection : Eligibility status determine use initial screening question . Participants determine ineligible thanked time , encourage continue CRC screen annually ( whatever schedule appropriate base risk status , age type screening obtain ) . Those eligible administer study consent . Consent procedure inform participant purpose detail study . Once participant consent , interview baseline data collection . The demographic data collect baseline confirm ( repeat ) participant appear clinic Phase II include age , date birth , gender , race , ethnicity , education , income insurance , marital status , number adult child household . Screening history risk status obtain determine eligibility serve baseline CRC screening data . Questionnaires administer face face Survey Interviewers ask question record answer . Questionnaire administration distribute across three different point : 1 ) baseline , 2 ) post-intervention , 3 ) 6 month post-intervention . Data collection material develop English Spanish review Cultural Community Advisory Board cultural fit across multicultural population low-income participant . Data collection cost-effectiveness analysis : Data cost analysis draw study clinic record track separately phase study . Navigators keep log time spend recruit site , run group class implement TN account salary spent Phase I intervention control . Phase II navigation call track clinic staff contract clinic . We also capture number clinic appointment make , keep , miss without timely cancellation number different type screening receive . Sample Size : We expect recruit randomize 1,840 participant total , allow 15 % attrition ( , 85 % retention ) final sample size 1,600 participant . Approximately 266 group 5-7 participant form , result approximately 133 control condition intervention condition . Education group begin stagger session 46 month . Approximately 450 participant recruit year achieve total recruitment goal . Recruitment : We recruit old adult , low-income participant community setting Phase I ( ) identify previously engage new formal site ( church , senior citizen center , employer ) recruitment , ( b ) continue canvass nontraditional option ( apartment complex , neighborhood association , barber shops/salons , area commerce ) , ( c ) investigate new type sit reach broad range multicultural population low-income area . Members Cultural Community Advisory Board ( CCAB ) include lay advisor strong community leader director represent key institution community link . Eligibility screen do face-to-face interview criterion meet informed consent administer .</detailed_description>

Those identify clinic home , however , also encourage join study long due screening . Phase II Inclusion criterion : • Participants keep clinic appointment Phase I enrol study clinic navigator Phase I inclusion criterion ( ) reconfirm . • Individuals compliant CRC screen guideline eligible . While intentionally exclude specific racial/ethnic group , study material offer Spanish English . As , anyone speak , read , write English Spanish eligible participate study .</criteria>
