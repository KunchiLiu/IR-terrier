	<brief_summary>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test effectiveness investigational drug learn whether drug work treat specific cancer . `` Investigational '' mean drug still study research doctor try find it-such safest dose use , side effect may cause , drug effective treat different type cancer . It also mean FDA approve drug use patient undergoing adjuvant treatment HER2+ breast cancer . Trastuzumab emtansine ( T-DM1 ) drug may stop cancer cell grow . This drug use research study information research study suggest drug may help prevent recurrence breast cancer research study . The use T-DM1 research study experimental , mean approved regulatory authority adjuvant treatment HER2-positive breast cancer . However , FDA-approved metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer . T-DM1 cause cancer cell die laboratory study . In preclinical study , drug prevent slowed growth breast cancer . The breast cancer treatment ( paclitaxel Trastuzumab ) use study consider part standard-of-care regimens early breast cancer . A standard treatment mean treatment would accept majority medical community suitable treatment type breast cancer . In research study , investigator look see study drug T-DM1 le side effect traditional HER2-positive breast cancer treatment trastuzumab paclitaxel . The investigator also hop learn long term benefit disease-free survival participant take study drug T-DM1 comparison participant take combination trastuzumab paclitaxel .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If participant agrees participate study ask undergo screening test procedure confirm eligible . Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn take part research study . If test procedure recently , may may repeat . These test procedure include : medical history , performance status , assessment tumor , blood test , cardiac test , pregnancy test collection tumor tissue . If test show eligible participate research study , begin study treatment . If meet eligibility criterion , able participate research study . Because one know study option best , participant `` randomize '' one study group breast surgery : Group 1 Group 2 . Randomization mean put group chance . Neither participant research doctor choose group . The participant one three chance place group . Approximately 375 study participant receive study drug , 125 study participant receive standard therapy trastuzumab paclitaxel . Group 1 participant receive study drug T-DM1 every three week IV ( intravenous injection ) 17 treatment ( total 51 week ) . Group 2 participant receive FDA-approved drug Paclitaxel Trastuzumab per week IV 12 week . Then begin week 13 , participant receive Trastuzumab IV injection every three week next 13 treatment . During cycle participant physical exam tumor assessment . The investigator would like keep track participant 's medical condition next five year final dose study drug . The investigator would like regular visit every 6 month 3 year completion study treatment , year next two year . The investigator may ask additional follow-up phone completion visit . Participants undergo lumpectomy ( breast conserve surgery ) need receive breast radiation therapy participate study . Participants undergone mastectomy may receive chest wall lymph node radiation ( determined discussion physician ) . Radiation Therapy begin conclusion study paclitaxel dos , 12 week fo study drug T-DM1 .</detailed_description>
