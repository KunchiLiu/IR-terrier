	<brief_title>Impact ADM Reduction Surgical Complexity Breast Reconstructions With Implants ( Nava )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design compare clinical outcome patient undergo mastectomy follow direct implant breast reconstruction Strattice™ Reconstructive Tissue Matrix patient undergo standard two-stage reconstruction without Strattice™ mesh tissue flap . Potential candidate study identify routine practice . Women meet inclusion exclusion criterion invite participate study . A screening visit take place maximally 30 day prior surgery . Randomization occur maximally 7 day prior mastectomy procedure . As woman may undergo bilateral mastectomy reconstruction , randomization scheme ensure breast reconstruct surgical approach . The Day Surgery consist mastectomy breast reconstruction . The surgical site breast evaluate day hospital discharge postoperative day 14 30 patient hospital admission . During visit , breast examine Acute Inflammatory Assessment ( AIR ) complete . In addition breast flap incision evaluate sign infection , seroma , hematoma skin necrosis .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>A study patient may include : 1 . Has plan undergo unilateral bilateral mastectomy small medium size breast ( predict breast implant size maximally 500 gm ) , none moderate ( Grade 1 2 ) ptosis , healthy , sufficiently thick , wellvascularized skin flap anticipate surgeon . 2 . Is clinically suitable candidate immediate reconstruction ADM base single stage reconstruction technique ( define use Experimental arm ) . 3 . Is female , ≥18 year age . 4 . Is willing undergo immediate breast reconstruction subpectoralis muscle placement breast implant either Experimental ( ADM base single stage ) Control ( TE/Implant base two stage ) technique . 5 . Is good health breast pathology suit general anesthesia plan treatment . 6 . Understands willing follow aspect study protocol include randomization sign date approve Informed Consent Form prior studyrelated procedure perform . A study patient exclude participation study : 1 . Has undergone breast radiation treatment and/or preoperatively evaluate require radiation treatment breast area course study . 2 . Has collagenvascular , connective tissue , uncorrectable bleeding disorder determine clinically PI . 3 . Has BMI ≥ 35 . 4 . Has disease , include uncontrolled diabetes , clinically know impact wound heal ability . 5 . Has autoimmune disease , immune deficiency , immune suppression drug current treatment breast cancer . 6 . Currently alcohol/substance abuse problem relapse within 1 year prior screen visit . 7 . Is pregnant , lactate . 8 . Has concomitant unrelated condition breast/chest wall/skin , determine PI , could affect surgical outcome ( e.g . significant chest wall abnormality include pectus excavatum pectus carinatum ) . 9 . Has abscess infection time surgery . 10 . Has undergone previous breast surgery exception breast biopsy , cyst removal , lumpectomy . 11 . Has prior soft tissue support device implant breast participate another clinical trial breast related device ( e.g . drain , expanders , implant ) . 12 . Has know pork allergy sensitive polysorbate .</criteria>
