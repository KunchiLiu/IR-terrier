	<detailed_description>The burden acute gastroenteritis ( AGE ) child family continue enormous . It account 1.7 million pediatric emergency department ( ED ) visit annually United States nearly 240,000 Canada . Children often suffer prolong severe illness ; amongst hospitalize Canadian child , 19 % clinical sepsis , 7 % seizures 4 % require intensive care unit admission.3 In study conduct 11 Canadian EDs , 51 % child experience moderate severe disease . Parents rate episode equivalent 10 day admission ( moderate ) persistent moderate hearing loss ( severe ) . The burden augment 50 % household transmission rate2 , 6 42 % prolonged work absenteeism rate . Apart supportive care , health-care provider little offer relieve suffering . Probiotics , define viable microbial preparation beneficial effect health host , represent rapidly expand field . While available over-the-counter product , accord National Institutes Health , Food Drug Administration yet approve single agent health claim . Further , 2012 meta-analysis conclude limited data support indication publish pediatric gastroenteritis trial report side effect . Thus , understand benefit side effect probiotics crucial widespread use endorse . Although probiotic clinical trial perform , one ( still unpublished ) ED base . Most study date significantly flaw guideline NOT endorse use state well-controlled human trial need . Consequently , others find rarely used clinical practice . Reasons cite include ( 1 ) questionable clinical meaning outcome evaluate thus far ; ( 2 ) absence study appropriate patient population , ( 3 ) lack confidence quality probiotic agent study . This study address ( 1 ) need medical community , aware widen gap number important pediatric adult trial ( 2 ) interest caregiver `` probiotic '' - 71 % aware term ; 31 % believe may beneficial child diarrhea , &gt; 90 % would administer probiotic could make child well . Furthermore , pilot study provide promising preliminary data proven feasibility method . Thus poised conduct randomize control trial ( RCT ) definitively determine meaningful benefit derive probiotic use provide critical information regard mechanism action . This information impact practice , burden disease , ensure child receive best care possible . The result propose RCT enable guideline either clearly endorse recommend routine use probiotic agent child Acute Gastroenteritis . We also hypothesize therapeutic benefit probiotic child AGE vary infect pathogen . We assemble team bridge gap clinical RCT team , molecular diagnostics , immunologic quantify pathogen-specific effect probiotic . The latter likely distinct mechanism ( e.g . invasive , inflammatory , non-inflammatory ) pathogens cause clinical symptom . Similarly , probiotic effect exert multiple modes-of-action ( e.g . direct antimicrobial activity , competitive exclusion , immune response stimulation , inhibition virulence gene protein expression ) . The simultaneous evaluation pathogen-specific effect clinical , microbiological immunological level previously perform . The knowledge gain multi-faceted approach inform understand probiotic-host-pathogen interaction responsible improved clinical outcome child AGE . Our study population , outpatient child , main group patient suffer AGE well main consumer probiotic . Thus , finding relevant ready translation clinical care simultaneously open avenue future research . The principal question address follow : Hypotheses : In child age 3-48 month present ED le 72 hour AGE like symptom , compare placebo , administration probiotic agent : 1 . Will result significantly low proportion child develop moderate severe disease subsequent 2 week . 2 . Will associate significantly great occurrence minor side effect . 3 . Will associate great increase secretory IgA ( sIgA ) . 4 . Will vary effect base etiologic pathogen , give diverse underlie pathophysiologic process induce causative agent multiple mechanisms action probiotic . Clinical Efficacy : Primary Question : For previously healthy child , age 3-48 month , present ED le 72 hour AGE like symptom , proportion develop moderate severe disease [ Modified Vesikari Score ( MVS ) ≥ 9 ] follow ED evaluation , significantly different receive probiotic agent ( Lacidofil ) compare receive placebo ? Secondary Questions : In group patient , amongst receive active treatment versus placebo : 1 . Is difference ( ) duration diarrhea ( b ) duration vomit ? 2 . Is difference proportion require unscheduled health care provider visit ? 3 . Is difference effectiveness treatment base infect pathogen ? Side Effect Profile : Question : In group patient , proportion experience side effect ( e.g . bloating , fever , abdominal distention , rash ) significantly different receive Lacidofil compare placebo ? Mechanism Action : Question : In group patient , fecal sIgA level 5 day 4 week initiation treatment higher receive Lacidofil compare receive placebo ? Microbiologic - Stool Pathogen-Specific Load : Question : In group patient , difference pathogen specific reduction stool pathogen load receive Lacidofil compare receive placebo ?</detailed_description>
