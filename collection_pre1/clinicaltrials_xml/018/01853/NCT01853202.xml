	<brief_summary>Patients lymphoma cancer receive chemotherapy outpatient set risk blood clot form vein . The occurrence blood clot major implication personal health include need blood thinner monitoring , potential bleeding , complication relate blood clot cardiovascular health . The goal study determine whether aerobic exercise training therapeutic strategy offset risk blood clot improve quality life among cancer patient chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EXercise Training Prevention Cancer Thrombosis ( EXPECT ) Pilot Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Activation blood coagulation system common manifestation cancer associate premature death venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) . ( 1-5 ) Ambulatory cancer patient undergo chemotherapy lymphoma cancer lung , ovarian , stomach , bladder , pancreas confer 12.6 % absolute rate VTE 1-year compare similarly age-sex matched control , nearly 50 % VTE event occur within first 3 month treatment . ( 6 ) Further , cancer patient develop VTE 2.5-fold high mortality risk compare cancer patient experience VTE . ( 3 ) Therapies offset VTE risk , low-molecular weight heparin vitamin K antagonist , currently recommend American Society Clinical Oncology Guidelines secondary lack robust clinical trial data , potential bleeding , need monitor dose adjustment . ( 7 ) As , alternative strategy prevent VTE chemotherapy without add toxicity urgently require . The investigator hypothesize aerobic exercise training therapeutic strategy mitigate VTE risk among ambulatory cancer patient undergo chemotherapy . Aerobic exercise training moderate intensity favorable effect coagulation factor reduce risk VTE healthy population . ( 8-11 ) To date , study determine whether exercise training favorable impact coagulation factor implicate VTE risk . Furthermore , lack data regard impact exercise training functional performance patient-reported outcome among ambulatory cancer patient chemotherapy . The focus grant application establish whether aerobic exercise training potential modality prevent VTE ambulatory lymphoma cancer patient chemotherapy . To end , investigator propose EXercise Training PrEvention Cancer Thrombosis ( EXPECT ) Pilot trial , two-arm randomize control trial ( RCT ) compare aerobic exercise training ( three supervise treadmill session per week nonconsecutive day 12 week moderate intensity ( 50-70 % baseline VO2max ) ) , versus control among 54 subject ( 27/group ) . Patients high risk VTE malignancy receive chemotherapy ambulatory set focus recruitment . ( 2 , 6 , 12 ) The primary endpoint change thrombin generation , ( 13 ) well establish VTE risk marker cancer . ( 14 , 15 ) We also assess relationship exercise train factor Xa generation , key modulator thrombosis novel therapeutic target VTE prevention . ( 16 , 17 ) Design Procedures : Potential participant identify screened eligibility study clinical research coordinator via medical record review candidate schedule initiate chemotherapy Vermont Cancer Center . After obtain write consent , participant complete follow baseline assessment : ( 1 ) fast blood draw ( 2 ) cardiopulmonary exercise test ( CPET ) . Blood draw CPET baseline assessment repeat end 12 week intervention . Group ( Randomization ) : Participants randomly allocate , individual basis , one two study group prior initiation chemotherapy . Randomly allocate participant remain group remainder study ( i.e. , cross-over ) . Randomization stratify cancer type ensure balance type group . Exercise Intervention : All participant agree participate exercise testing , exercise logging , blood draw , survey pre post intervention . The intervention , depend randomization , include : Group 1 - The goal AT group 3 supervise exercise sessions/week intensity 50 % -70 % individually determine VO2max 30-45 min/session 12 week . The aerobic training intervention closely mimic standard exercise-based guideline adopt cardiac rehabilitation . All intervention session perform supervised set one-on-one supervision American College Sports Medicine-certified exercise physiologist . Aerobic exercise training prescribe base guide ACSM principle aim improve VO2max . Walking choose preferred mode exercise training cancer patient . ( 51 ) Group 2 - Control : The 12-week program consist monthly phone contact check patient review exercise log entry month order capture physical activity do outside intervention set . Study Endpoints : Markers VTE Risk : Investigators measure follow marker VTE risk : thrombin , FXa , F 1+2 , TAT , D-Dimer , vWF , soluble P-selectin , C-reactive protein . Samples process clinic attention issue relate coagulation activation , plasma serum store -80 degree C laboratory . Functional Capacity : VO2peak : To determine VO2peak , incremental treadmill test ( modify Balke protocol ) 12-lead ECG monitoring ( Mortara ) perform ACSM-certified exercise physiologist . Expired gas analyze continuously metabolic measurement system ( Sensormedics Vmax 29c ) . Physical Functioning also include subjective ( i.e. , SF-36 ) assessment well 6-min walk distance test describe previously . ( 55 ) Fatigue : The Fatigue Symptom Inventory ( FSI ) test several cancer patient population use assess fatigue ( 56 ) Anxiety depression assess use The Medical Outcomes Study , Short Form Health Survey ( SF-36 ) . This widely use validate instrument assess general functional health relate quality life . ( 58 ) The SF-36 36 item instrument contain eight individual scale measure follow domain : physical functioning , role physical , bodily pain , social functioning , mental health , vitality , role emotional general health perception . Exercise Experience : Individuals experience exercise predicts participation exercise intervention . Exercise Self-Efficacy : Self-efficacy refers one 's belief he/she successfully complete give activity . ( 59 ) Adherence evaluate assess rate study eligibility , acceptance , overall accrual . Safety evaluate type prevalence adverse event exercise-related assessment .</detailed_description>
