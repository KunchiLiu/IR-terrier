	<brief_title>Tivozanib Recurrent , Platinum-Resistant Ovarian , Fallopian Tube Primary Peritoneal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine clinical activity tivozanib patient platinum-resistant , recurrent ovarian , fallopian tube primary peritoneal cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determining potential survival advantage characterize safety single agent tivozanib patient platinum-resistant ovarian cancer . OUTLINE : Patients receive tivozanib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 . Courses repeat every 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
