	<brief_summary>The main objective access efficacy first second line antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) determinants patient treat Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital Kumasi ( KATH ) , Ghana , compare clinical , virological immunological efficacy second line ART patient switch virological failure compare patient switch clinical immunological failure . Other specific study objective : 1 . To establish HIV Cohort Study study site . 2 . To assess rate virological failure among patient first line therapy 3 . To compare clinical , immunological virological efficacy second line antiretroviral therapy amongst patient randomise virological monitoring whilst first line compare monitor routinely use clinical immunological monitoring . 4 . To assess incidence outcome tuberculosis ( TB ) opportunistic infection patient treat Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital HIV service 5 . To obtain parameter quality care , e. g. performance TB screening procedure 6 . To develop strategy minimise treatment failure , basis result study 7 . To generate large prospective second-line ART cohort , serve basis research project 8 . To implement point-of-care viral load analysis Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital 9 .

	<brief_title>Kumasi Cohort Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design : Open randomize study Recruitment : All patient stable ART least one year ask participate study thorough information objectives/procedures study associate inconveniences/risks . After informed consent give , patient ask complete short questionnaire history antiretroviral therapy , include information drug adherence , reliability drug supply , side effect complication highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) . Data socioeconomic status , perceive difficulty related antiretroviral therapy subjective quality care support offer HIV treatment program document . Randomization : Patients randomize arm I ( n=1500 ) , viral load testing ( VL ) addition clinical immunological monitoring accord algorithm list , group II ( eligible patient , least n=1500 ) , clinical immunological monitoring ( CI ) . Randomization conduct accord computer list . Blood sampling : In addition blood drawn routine workup HIV service ( CD4 cell count , biochemistry ) , additional 10ml blood sample ( 5ml EDTA , 5ml serum ) obtain patient enrol study analysis viral load major confounders ART outcome , e. g. viral hepatitis . Additionally , blood sample ( 5ml EDTA plasma ) take patient arm II ( CI ) switch second line ART upon clinical immunological failure viral load analysis . Viral load analysis : To assure timely clinical availability viral load testing , point care test require shall establish KATH . A Cobas® Amplicore Analyzer ( Roche Diagnostics ) instal KATH routinely use , although functional , due lack resource . Viral load test shall conduct adequate training staff service machine assure . Definition therapy failure : Therapy failure define accord WHO national guideline antiretroviral therapy : 1 . Clinical failure occurrence new opportunistic infection malignancy signify clinical disease progression , recurrence prior opportunistic infection onset/recurrence WHO stage 3 4 condition . 2 . Immunologic failure return CD4 count pre-therapy baseline , and/or 50 % fall on-therapy CD4 peak-level ( and/or 50 % fall CD4 ) , persistent low CD4 le 100 cells/µl one year therapy without concomitant infection explain low CD4 . 3 . Virological failure define plasma HIV-1 RNA level 5,000 copies/mL person regimen 6 month without concomitant infection explain rise non-suppression viral load drug adherence determine sufficient . In patient viral load &gt; 5000 copy per mL evidence insufficient drug adherence , adherence counseling conduct viral load control 3 month . If viral load &gt; 5000 copy per mL , adherence determine sufficient , patient shall switch second line ART . In patient viral load 50 5,000 copy per mL , adherence counseling conduct viral load repeat 3 6 month . Patients viral load &gt; 500 copy per mL upon control shall switch second-line ART . ART Switch : Patients meet definition virological , immunological clinical failure specify , inform indication switch second-line ART accord national guideline , benefit possible side effect second-line ART . Patients however choice refuse switch second-line treatment . Currently , recommend available second-line regime : 1 . Tenofovir plus lamivudine patient fail first line backbone zidovudine plus lamivudine 2 . Zidovudine plus lamivudine patient fail backbone Tenofovir plus lamivudine together Lopinavir/ritonavir . Other available backbone available seldom use include Abacavir didanosine . Adherence monitor counseling : Adherence monitor self reporting , pill count pharmacy record , indicate national guideline antiretroviral therapy . All patient virological , immunological clinical therapy failure receive adherence counsel switch second-line ART . Patients detectable viral load equally receive adherence counseling , control viral load 3 month . Follow-up : Patients re-evaluated accord national guideline . Patients without detectable viral load evidence treatment failure see every 6 month frequently clinically indicate . Patients switch second-line ART closely follow assess tolerance . Usually , within 14 day initiation treatment , monthly first 3 month , interval 2-6 month . End point : Primary end point : Combined endpoint clinical failure 12 24 month switch second line treatment , define : 1 . First/new AIDS define event 2 . Death Secondary end point : 1 . Absolute number CD4 cell diagnosis therapy failure 2 . Mean increase CD4 cell count 12/24months 3 . Frequency time therapy change , Lost-to-follow 4 . ART-related Adverse Events ( AE ) 5 . Adherence Interventions : Apart viral load analysis subgroup randomly assign patient , intervention carry within study . Viral load result make available clinician treat patient help management . Sample size calculation : No substantiate data report regard expect difference combine primary endpoint , occurrence clinical failure ( death new AIDS defining event ) switch second line ART group . Based exist data , assume incidence primary endpoint 4 % first year switch second line ART [ 1 ] . To detect difference 1.5 % follow-up period one year power 0.8 , sample size 626 patient ( 313 per group ) need . By screen 1500 patient viral load testing , assume rate virological failure 30 % , total 450 patient offer second line ART [ 2 ] . Thus , assume 20-30 % either give informed consent , drop evaluable , appear adequate randomize 1500 patient viral load analysis achieve calculate sample size . Statistical analysis : An interim analysis do primary secondary end point 12 24 month recruitment complete . Because number patient clinical failure become evident recruitment period lower number patient treatment failure detect viral load analysis , patient already start second-line ART upon clinical failure evaluate retrospectively . Statistical analysis perform use SPSS statistic 19 software package .</detailed_description>
