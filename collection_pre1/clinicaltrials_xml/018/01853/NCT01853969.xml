	<detailed_description>Carpal tunnel syndrome condition median nerve compress wrist . It cause symptoms numbness , tingle , weakness , muscle damage , pain . If non-operative treatment work generally patient go carpal tunnel release surgery transverse carpal ligament release . After surgery patient usually return work restriction within six week . Patients often ask soon able return type surgery , type ability like surgery . Currently study evaluate long take patient 's type skill return pre-operative skill level . We would like answer question compare type result different time point include baseline prior surgery . We additionally seek identify patient characteristic predictive fast return type proficiency . An additional innovative aspect project use web-based type test use assessment patient type proficiency . We additionally use web-based model collection survey data .</detailed_description>
