	<brief_summary>Colonoscopy gold standard diagnostic procedure colonic disease . Excellent bowel cleanse critical procedure . However , inadequate bowel cleanse common problem occur 20 % procedure . This fact deep clinical economical impact . In fact , inadequate bowel preparation associate misdiagnosis 30 % lesion . Moreover several clinical condition cirrhosis , antidepressant drug , hospitalize patient predictive factor inadequate colonic preparation . These circumstance promote multiple clinical trial , however consensus optimal strategy colonic cleansing . Education colonic preparation obtain conflict result . Polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) sodium phosphate solution commonest preparation use similar efficacy . However , large volume ingest ( 4 litter ) make PEG compliance difficult . Likewise , sodium phosphate also contain high level sodium phosphate contraindicate use elderly patient / comorbidity . The use adjuvant olive oil bisacodyl allow reduce volume polyethylene glycol thereby improve tolerance right colon preparation . The aim study compare efficacy multidisciplinary approach ( education , fiber free diet , polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) 2L , adjuvant bisacodyl + olive oil ) vs. conventional approach ( fiber free diet+ PEG 4L split dos ) clean colon hospitalize patient .</brief_summary>
