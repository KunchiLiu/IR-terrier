	<brief_summary>Background : - Pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial ( PNTM ) infection cause common type bacteria environment . Although PNTM infection common people lung disease , also affect healthy people . It difficult treat , affect part body lung . For example , PNTM may affect cilium , hair-like structure inside nose lung help move dirt debris body . - Ciliary beat frequency ( CBF ) measurement fast cilia move . People PNTM infection lower CBF healthy people . Nitric oxide ( NO ) gas body may affect CBF . People PNTM infection produce low amount NO nose healthy people . Researchers want see drug call sildenafil increase NO production CBF . If sildenafil improve measurement , may useful treatment PNTM infection . Objectives : - To study effect sildenafil CBF NO level people PNTM infection . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age PNTM infection . - Participants must enrol related National Institutes Health study bacterial infection . The study Natural History , Genetics , Phenotype Treatment Mycobacterial Infections . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . They also heart lung function test , well test NO production nose . They provide sample sputum cell inside nose . - Before first study visit , participant collect sputum sample 24 hour . They bring sample study visit . - At first study visit , participant heart lung function test , well test NO production nose . They provide blood , urine , sputum , nasal cell sample . They also receive sildenafil tablet take home . - Participants take sildenafil tablet three time day . - The second study visit 7 day first one . The test first visit repeat . Participants receive sildenafil tablet take schedule . - The third final study visit 30 day first one . The test first visit repeat . Participants stop take sildenafil visit . - A follow-up phone call make 2 week final study visit . This call ask question quality life symptom side effect study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Pulmonary nontuberculous mycobacterial ( PNTM ) infection increase past several decade , especially old woman . No consistent immunological abnormality find despite extensive investigation . In cystic fibrosis primary ciliary dyskinesia , mucociliary dysfunction predisposes individual high rate PNTM disease increase markedly age . We study respiratory biology subject PNTM healthy control find decreased level nasal nitric oxide ( nNO ) vivo . Ex vivo analysis ciliated respiratory epithelium subject PNTM demonstrate abnormally low rest ciliary beat frequency ( CBF ) abnormal response toll-like receptor ( [ TLR ] 2 , TLR3 , TLR5 , TLR7/8 , TLR9 ) agonists , compare respiratory sample healthy control . The low CBF response normalize ex vivo augment nitricoxide-cyclic guanosine monophosphate pathway ; supplementation appreciable effect difference TLR responses observed subject PNTM healthy control . The reduced CBF nNO level subject reveal possible mechanism susceptibility respiratory infection , well possible avenue direct investigation therapy . This open-label , interventional study evaluate effect sildenafil CBF subject PNTM infection . The study also measure effect sildenafil nNO , evaluate quality life , exertional capacity , pulmonary function , low airway microbiology , inflammatory marker , safety tolerability sildenafil treatment population . The first 5 subject receive oral bolus sildenafil ( 40 mg ) day 0 follow oral dose 20 mg 3 time day ( tid ) start day 1 approximately 6 day study visit day 7 . The remain 5 subject receive oral dose sildenafil ( 20 mg ) tid day 0 approximately 1 week study visit day 7 . Subsequently , dose increased subject 40 mg tid administer another 3 week study visit day 30 ( 4 week total ) . Administering initial oral bolus help u examine sildenafil immediate effect CBF safety parameter . The dose necessary modulate CBF subject population yet know , thus , feel undertake dose-ranging study allow thorough evaluation sildenafil effect CBF .</detailed_description>
