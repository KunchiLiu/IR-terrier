	<detailed_description>Background Subclinical hypothyroidism common condition among old adult , particularly age 65 year , prevalence reach 10 15 % population . This condition associate numerous adverse outcome , cardiovascular disease , cognition disturbance muscular problem . All potential outcome assess TRUST study . Subclinical hypothyroidism also associate increase risk develop depression . It suggest subclinical hypothyroidism may lower threshold development depression . The prevalence depression among community-dwelling elderly range 2 10 % . Patients depression show low response anti-depressive drug subclinical hypothyroidism . Only randomized study patient subclinical hypothyroidism study effect thyroid hormone replacement depression , conflict result : studied population often small ( maximal number participant : 143 ) , use different scale measure presence depressive symptom . Objective To investigate whether thyroid hormone replacement old adult subclinical hypothyroidism associate decrease presence depressive symptom sub-study TRUST study . Methods Use 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale ( GDS-15 ) measure depressive symptom 450 patient include TRUST study Switzerland Netherlands , validate test depression screening , validity measure longitudinal change . GDS-15 apply baseline 1 year compare change depression score placebo thyroxin arm . Power calculation ( ANCOVA method ) 225 participant per treatment group , assume standard deviation 3 baseline follow correlation 0.7 , result 99.9 % power detect mean difference 1.0 point two-sided alpha-level 0.05 . Depending recruitment main trial ( clinicaltrials.gov ID : NCT01660126 ) respective country , low number participant may include , retain large power continuous outcome .</detailed_description>
