	<detailed_description>Angina pectoris anginal equivalent dyspnoea frequent symptom relate impaired myocardial blood supply . The supply-demand imbalance arises set coronary artery disease address improve myocardial blood supply mechanical revascularization percutaneous coronary intervention bypass surgery reduce myocardial energy demand pharmacotherapy include use negative chronotropic agent beta blocker . When revascularization option , standard therapy insufficient control symptom , novel therapy attempt improve myocardial blood supply decrease angina . Enhanced external counterpulsation ( EECP ) device demonstrate augment cardiac performance coronary flow beneficial effect reduce anginal symptom patient CAD . ( 1-4 ) Transcutaneous ( non-invasive ) electrical nervous stimulation skeletal muscle improve venous return heart provide potential mechanism augment improve blood flow , include coronary flow , potential alternative method achieve similar effect , ( 5,6 ) less cumbersome easily integrated clinical practice . The gekoTM device small transcutaneous nerve stimulator ( weight 18g , dimension 149mm x 42mm x 11mm ) apply non-invasively skin common peroneal nerve low limb demonstrate safely stimulate blood flow gastrocnemius soleus venous system via activation venous 'pump ' system , intrinsic calf muscle . As result , gekoTM device approve use Canada improve blood flow already use clinical practice University Hospital . By improve venous return , device potential therapeutic effect management CAD augment coronary blood flow . The purpose PERCCAD Study investigate effect gekoTM device coronary blood flow order assess potential role therapeutic modality treatment symptomatic CAD . Further , since previous study EECP also demonstrate improvement endothelial function , investigator plan study effect gekoTM device endothelial function peripheral blood flow patient via non invasive technique ( 4 , 7 , 8 ) give establish relationship endothelial dysfunction cardiovascular risk . ( 9-12 ) The primary objective PERCCAD study ass effect gekoTM device coronary blood flow patient symptomatic CAD undergo invasive angiographic assessment management PCI . This evaluation gekoTM device perform time patient 's already plan invasive assessment management invasive data collect without expose patient risk already associate planned procedure usual clinical care . The secondary objective study assess effect muscle stimulation gekoTM device endothelial function peripheral blood flow measure via non-invasive technique . Study Design : Single arm clinical study patient act control ( coronary flow reserve endothelial function measure patient already undergo angiography PCI ) measurement record pre post application gekoTM device . Coronary flow assessment : The PCI procedure perform accord standard practice . As part routine practice , guidewire insert coronary artery use `` rail '' deliver balloon stent . Often , use special Doppler guidewire sensor tip use measurement blood flow . We use guidewire current study ( 13-16 ) . Velocity signal obtain guidewire average peak velocity ( APV ) determine . Intracoronary adenosine give induce hyperemia increase coronary flow ( 17-21 ) . Intracoronary adenosine use routinely PCI . Coronary flow reserve ( CFR ) calculate ratio APV hyperemia compare APV baseline . After measurement baseline APV CFR , perform two minute muscle stimulation use gekoTM device low pulse width setting record APV . After , two minute muscle stimulation use gekoTM device high pulse width set occur repeat APV CFR measurement record . This process perform least two coronary artery time patient 's usual invasive assessment management . Calf muscle stimulation gekoTM device : The gekoTM device fit bilaterally behind patient 's knee popliteal fossa . At appropriate time device set stimulate common peroneal nerve transcutaneously ( low setting set level patient sensation stimulation visible movement low leg ; high set patient 's high tolerable level , low level elicit slight visible movement low leg ) . Endothelial Function Assessment : Endothelial function study perform separate visit follow PCI , measurement peripheral vasodilator response use fingertip pulse amplitude tonometry ( peripheral arterial tonometry-PAT ) . PAT signal obtain EndoPAT2000 ( EndoPAT ) device ( Itamar Medical Inc. , Caesarea , Israel ) . The EndoPAT FDA approve device noninvasive assessment endothelial dysfunction , widely use clinical research purpose validate method endothelial function assessment . ( 22-24 ) Specially design finger probe place index finger patient 's hand . The probe comprise system inflatable latex air cuff connect pneumatic tube inflate device control computer algorithm . There occlusion arterial blood flow . Pulsatile volume change distal digit induce pressure alteration finger cuff , sensed pressure transducer transmit recorded EndoPAT . Endothelial function measure via reactive hyperemia-peripheral arterial tonometry index ( RH-PAT index ) . A reactive hyperemia protocol consist 5-minute baseline measurement , blood pressure cuff place test arm inflate 60 mmHg baseline systolic blood pressure , least 200 mmHg 5 minute . After 5 minute , cuff deflate , PAT trace record 5 minute . The ratio PAT signal cuff release , compare baseline , calculate computer algorithm automatically normalizing baseline signal , indexed contra lateral arm . The calculated ratio reflect RH-PAT index , reflection degree endothelial function . This process non-invasive require percutaneous vascular access . Endothelial function also assess baseline follow 1 hour treatment gekoTM use EndoPAT calculate RH-PAT index describe . In addition , effect popliteal artery vessel diameter Doppler flow velocity also record use surface ultrasound probe baseline follow 1 hour treatment gekoTM .</detailed_description>
