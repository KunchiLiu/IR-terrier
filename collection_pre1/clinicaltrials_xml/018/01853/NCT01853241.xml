	<brief_title>Prospective Randomized Trial Anterograde Single Balloon Versus Spirus Enteroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We currently perform spiral enteroscopy ( SE ) single balloon enteroscopy ( SBE ) Johns Hopkins Hospital . The decision procedure use determine endoscopist performing procedure , currently approximately 60 % perform SE 40 % perform SBE . We wish perform prospective , randomised trial , assess difference two procedure . The question difference two technique , term depth insertion , diagnostic therapeutic yield , time required procedure sedation requirement , important question answer , depend result , would affect investigator approach patient small bowel disease . The small bowel poorly suit standard endoscopy technique due anatomical difference colon upper gastrointestinal tract . The small bowel average length 6.7 , free mesentery resist standard `` push advance '' endoscopy technique . New development overtubes , place enteroscope , revolutionize investigator ability deeply intubate small bowel . The first new technique describe double balloon enteroscopy ( DBE ) ( Fujinon , Wayne , NJ ) 2001 . The next development single balloon enteroscopy ( SBE ) ( Olympus America , Center Valley PA ) , iteration DBE simply forgo second balloon tip endoscope , also allow deep enteroscopy available United States since 2007 . Spiral enteroscopy ( SE ) introduce soon SBE 2007 , consist spiral overtube ( Spirus Medical Inc. , Stoughton , Massachusetts , USA ) pleat small bowel onto enteroscope . DBE large amount publish data , 1370 patient 2591 examination . Data regard efficacy SBE SE limit DBE . SBE SE available United States since 2007 , therefore less publish data DBE . There two published series SBE , several publication abstract form . A total 362 case report , diagnostic yield range 30 % 76 % , therapeutic intervention perform 55 % . There 6 report SE procedure , one large series 1750 case document side effect SE . The overall diagnostic yield range 24 % 51 % similar treatment success rate . SBE compare DBE patient suspect small bowel disease three study report abstract form . SE compare push enteroscopy DBE , however study compare SBE SE . The risk associate augmented enteroscopy ( DBE , SBE , SE ) similar associate routine endoscopy include sedation-related complication , aspiration pneumonia , respiratory infection . In addition , complication specifically relate augment enteroscopy . Abdominal discomfort occur due trap gas . DBE associate intestinal cramp 2 % 20 % patient . The use CO2 , investigator routinely use Johns Hopkins , decrease post procedure abdominal cramping . Minor small bowel contusion occur . The incidence gastrointestinal haemorrhage seem increase augmented enteroscopy compare standard endoscopic procedure . Pancreatitis occur 6 ( 0.2 % ) case report multicenter United States study DBE . There report pancreatitis associate SBE SE enteroscopy . Intestinal perforation rare serious event . Perforation report 5 ( 0.2 % ) 2591 DBE examination . In SBE , one perforation report series 37 patient , case report perforation patient jejuna ulceration metastatic adenocarcinoma unknown primary . A mucosal tear , require endoscopic clip esophageal gastric perforation , severe bleed require transfusion , cardio-pulmonary arrest death . There 7 ( 0.4 % ) severe complication . Six small bowel perforation ( 0.34 % ) . In Johns Hopkins one perforation use SBE one use SE one occur patient small bowel Crohns disease ( SBE ) patient alter anatomy ( SE ) ( personal communication Dr PI Okolo ) . This latter group patient know increased risk perforation endoscopic procedure exclude study . There serious complication associate either SE SBE enteroscopy . All individual participate study already schedule augment enteroscopy . Therefore , additional risk incur patient participate study , risk augment enteroscopy part routine clinical care patient .</detailed_description>
