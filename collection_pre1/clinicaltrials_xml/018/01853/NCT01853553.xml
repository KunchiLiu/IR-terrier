	<brief_summary>The propose research determine effectiveness block aldosterone improve health function arteries patient autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ( ADPKD ) . The study also provide insight block aldosterone improve artery health determine physiological mechanism ( biological reason ) involve . Overall , propose research provide important new scientific evidence upon physician base recommendation patient ADPKD decrease risk develop cardiovascular disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Cardiovascular complication currently major cause mortality among patient autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease ( ADPKD ) . Therefore , test valid intervention reduce morbidity mortality within population high priority . It well document endothelial dysfunction couple abnormality marker oxidative stress inflammation develop early ADPKD even significant decline kidney function . Aldosterone level increase patient ADPKD may contribute cardiovascular disease impair endothelial function , reduce vascular compliance . Of note , aldosterone antagonist show improve endothelial dysfunction number study patient population . However , clinical interventional study specifically target endothelial dysfunction ADPKD . Our main goal establish efficacy aldosterone antagonist ( spironolactone ) treat vascular endothelial dysfunction large elastic artery stiffness ADPKD patient preserve kidney function . A key secondary goal determine integrative physiological ( i.e. , whole limb/artery molecular ) mechanisms underlying beneficial effect spironolactone . Working Hypotheses : 1 . Six month aldosterone antagonist increase endothelium-dependent dilation ( EDD ) reduce large elastic artery stiffness ADPKD patient preserve kidney function . 2 . The improvement EDD aldosterone antagonist associate reduce circulate endothelial cell marker oxidative stress inflammation . 3 . The improvement large elastic artery stiffness aldosterone antagonist associate reduce circulate endothelial cell marker oxidative stress inflammation , change marker structural protein turnover . Impact Field : The expected result provide first insight : - Efficacy aldosterone antagonist primary treatment vascular dysfunction ADPKD patient preserve kidney function . - Cellular molecular physiological mechanism treatment benefit confer .</detailed_description>
