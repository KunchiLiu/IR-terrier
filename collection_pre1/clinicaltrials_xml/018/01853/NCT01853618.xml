	<brief_summary>Background : - Tremelimumab cancer treatment drug help immune system recognize destroy cancer cell . Researchers want see use treat advance liver cancer . The drug give one two type treatment liver cancer . The first type , transarterial catheter chemoembolization ( TACE ) , inject chemotherapy drug tumor main blood vessel feeding . That blood vessel close help keep drug tumor longer . The second type , radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) , use heat probe destroy tumor tissue . Researchers want study safe effective treatment study drug . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness Tremelimumab TACE RFA advance liver cancer . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age advance liver cancer respond treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tremelimumab With Chemoembolization Ablation Liver Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Worldwide , hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) fifth common malignancy median survival 6-9 month . For patient advanced disease sorafenib approve drug limit benefit . Tremelimumab monoclonal antibody CTLA4 . Anti-CTLA4 therapy show enhance anti-tumor immunity block tumor-induced immune suppression cytotoxic T cell . Both trans-arterial catheter chemoembolization ( TACE ) radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) show induce peripheral immune response . The underlying hypothesis study effect anti-CTLA4 treatment enhance TACE RFA patient advance hepatocellular carcinoma . Objectives : Primary : To assess safety feasibility combine Tremelimumab trans-arterial catheter chemoembolization ( TACE ) radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) , cryoablation stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) patient advanced HCC . Secondary : To evaluate follow patient advanced HCC undergo TACE radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) combination Tremelimumab : - change immune parameter peripheral blood - clinical indicator efficacy ( response rate , time tumor progression , overall survival ) Eligibility : Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis HCC . Childs-Pugh A/B7 cirrhosis allow . If patient cirrhosis , limitation apply . Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer ( BCLC ) Stage B C patient . Patients must disease amenable potentially curative resection , radiofrequency ablation , liver transplantation .</detailed_description>
