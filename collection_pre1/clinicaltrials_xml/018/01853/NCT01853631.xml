	<brief_summary>Subjects study type lymph gland cancer call Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma , acute lymphocytic leukemia , chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia ( disease refer `` lymphoma '' `` leukemia '' ) . The lymphoma leukemia come back go away treatment . The body different way fight infection disease . No one way seem perfect fight cancer . This research study combine two different way fight disease , antibodies T cell , hop work together . Both antibody T cell use treat patient cancer . They show promise , strong enough cure patient . T cell kill tumor cell normally enough kill tumor cell . Some researcher take T cell person 's blood , grown laboratory give back person . The antibody use study call anti-CD19 . It first come mouse develop immunity human lymphoma . This antibody stick lymphoma cell substance outside cell call CD19 . CD19 antibody use treat people lymphoma leukemia . For study , anti-CD19 change instead float free blood join T cell . When antibody join T cell way call chimeric receptor . In laboratory , investigator find T cell work well also add protein stimulate T cell , one call CD28 . Adding CD28 make cell last long body long enough able kill lymphoma cell . The investigator believe add extra stimulate protein , call CD137 , cell well chance kill lymphoma cell . The investigator go see true put CD19 chimeric receptor CD28 alone half cell CD19 chimeric receptor CD28 CD137 half cell . These CD19 chimeric receptor T cell CD28 without CD137 investigational product approve FDA . The purpose study find big dose chimeric T cell safe , see long T cell sort chimeric receptor last , learn side effect see whether therapy might help people lymphoma leukemia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients give investigator blood make CD19 CD28 ( without CD137 ) chimeric receptor-T cell laboratory . These cell grow frozen . To make T cell , investigator take blood ( blood donor ) stimulate growth factor make T cell grow . To get CD19 antibody CD28 ( without CD137 ) attach surface T cell , insert antibody gene T cell . This do virus call retrovirus make study carry antibody gene T cell . This virus also help find T cell blood injecting ; order tell apart investigator make two virus slightly different one CD137 . These two virus tell apart special laboratory test . Because patient receive cell new gene , patient follow total 15 year see long term side effect gene transfer . If patient visit clinic , contact research coordinator physician . When subject enroll study , assign dose CD19 chimeric receptor-T cell . Several study suggest infuse T cell need room able proliferate accomplish function may happen many T cell circulation . Because , subject 's level circulating T cell relatively high , s/he may receive one treatment cyclophosphamide ( Cytoxan ) fludarabine doctor think appropriate . This drug decrease number subject 's T cell infusion CD19 chimeric receptor T cell . If subject already receive chemotherapy , may need . The investigator would prefer subject receive chemotherapy 6 week cell infusion doctor think medically necessary . Patients give injection cell vein IV assign dose . The injection take 20 minute . The investigator follow clinic injection 3 hour . If 6 week evaluation period infusion , patient seem experience benefit ( confirmed radiological study , physical exam and/or symptom ) , s/he may able receive five additional dos T cell s/he wish . The first repeat infusion take place least 6 week first infusion . Any additional infusion would least 4 week apart . All additional infusion dose level receive first time lower dose . The treatment give Center Cell Gene Therapy Texas Children 's Hospital Houston Methodist Hospital .</detailed_description>
