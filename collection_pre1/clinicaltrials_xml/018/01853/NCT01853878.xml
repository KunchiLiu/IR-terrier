	<brief_summary>The purpose study test potential new kind anti-cancer treatment , call PRAME immunotherapy resect patient lung cancer . As 18 July 2014 , recruitment stop prematurely study unblinded . Only patient active treatment option continue study . Patients randomise Placebo group withdrawn . There longer active follow-up patient discontinuation completion treatment . The study end 30 day last dose administer . As result , primary secondary objective assess plan . All clinical safety data collect study analyse descriptively . For biological sample already collect scope study test yet , test perform default , except scientific rationale remain relevant despite premature termination study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Demonstrate Benefit New Kind Anti-cancer Treatment PReferentially Expressed Antigen MElanoma ( PRAME ) Immunotherapy Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) , After Removal Their Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During treatment period , safety monitoring continue initially foreseen . Reporting post-study adverse event ( AEs ) serious AEs ( SAEs ) continue per protocol . In best interest patient , biological sample protocol research purpose ( i.e . serum sample humoral immunity , whole blood sample pharmacogenetics ) take .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The patient radically resect NSCLC The NSCLC pathological stage IAT1b , IB , II IIIA NSCLC The surgical technique resection patient 's tumor anatomical , involve least segmentectomy The patient 's tumor show expression PRAME . The patient â‰¥ 18 year age time first consent . Written inform consent obtain patient prior performance studyspecific procedure . The patient free disease ( residual tumor , locoregional recurrence , distant metastasis ) , confirm post thoracic surgery contrastenhanced compute tomography ( CT scan ) chest , upper abdomen contrastenhanced CT scan Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) brain . Other examination perform clinically indicate . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 , 1 2 time randomization Adequate bonemarrow reserve , adequate renal , hepatic adrenal function assess standard laboratory criterion If patient female , must nonchildbearing potential , i.e . current tubal ligation , hysterectomy , ovariectomy postmenopausalor childbearing potential , must practice adequate contraceptionfor 30 day prior administration study product , negative pregnancy test continue precaution study treatment period 2 month last treatment administration . Patients investigator believe comply requirement protocol ( e.g . return active followup visit ) . The patient diagnose concomitant malignancy and/or history malignancy within past five year malignancy complete remission le 5 year . Patients effectively treat non melanoma skin cancer effectively treat carcinoma situ cervix remission le 5 year eligible . The patient receive anticancer specific treatment , include radiotherapy , immunotherapy , hormonal therapy , chemotherapy neoadjuvant chemotherapy , except : Administration adjuvant platinumbased doublet chemotherapy treatment current NSCLC allow surgery randomization . Treatment previous malignancy allow protocol . The patient diagnose Potential ImmuneMediated Disease ( pIMD ) . Patients vitiligo exclude study . The patient history confirm adrenal dysfunction . The patient require concomitant treatment immunosuppressive agent , systemic corticosteroid prescribe chronic treatment ( 7 consecutive day ) . The patient need chronic long term oxygen therapy ( LTOT ) . The patient medically uncontrolled congestive heart failure hypertension , unstable heart disease uncontrolled arrhythmia time randomization . The patient uncontrolled bleed disorder . The patient undergone splenectomy . The patient know Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV ) positive . The patient psychiatric addictive disorder may compromise his/her ability give inform consent , comply trial procedure . The patient concurrent severe medical problem , unrelated malignancy , would significantly limit full compliance study expose patient unacceptable risk . The patient history allergic disease reaction likely exacerbate component study investigational product . The patient receive investigational nonregistered product within 30 day precede randomization , plan use study period . For female patient : patient pregnant lactate plan become pregnant .</criteria>
