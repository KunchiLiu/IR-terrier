	<brief_summary>Many patient suffer devastate injury vascularize composite tissue . Vascularized composite tissue blocs functional tissue contain multiple tissue type bone , muscle , nerve , blood vessel , tendon , ligament , others . Examples patient severe vascularize composite tissue defect include limb amputee , patient third-degree burn face extremity , soldier improvised-explosive-device blast injury face , others . These patient help satisfactorily conventional reconstructive surgery ; however , recently vascularize composite allotransplantation ( VCA ) transplantation face limbs become available patient . Unfortunately , juncture , patient receive VCA must submit life-long regime immunosuppressant drug serious side effect infection , renal toxicity cancer . Immune tolerance absence destructive immune response recipient 's body transplant , otherwise maintain sufficient immune function fight infection threat . Transplant recipient immune tolerance need take immunosuppression drug . The investigator believe achieve immune tolerance recipient face limb transplant .</brief_summary>
