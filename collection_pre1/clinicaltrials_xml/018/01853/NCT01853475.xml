	<brief_summary>Piperaquine tablet ( coat ) + OZ439 granule + TPGS granule co-administered Phase IIb ( adult ) . However , safety PK data ( OZ439 plus piperaquine ) obtain use piperaquine tablet plus OZ439 Powder Bottle milk . Piperaquine yet administer together TPGS . Co-administration piperaquine plus OZ439 Powder Bottle ( PIB ) milk result increase OZ439 exposure ( current estimate ~ 70 % due small drug drug interaction ) . This study investigate exposure piperaquine OZ439 co-administered piperaquine phosphate tablet OZ439 + TPGS prototype ( formulation close Phase IIb , identical ) , order select appropriate dos Phase IIb . The reference treatment piperaquine phosphate tablet + OZ439 Powder Bottle + full fat milk</brief_summary>
