	<brief_summary>TITLE Perianal Abscess Packing ( PAP ) : randomise control trial ( Pilot study ) DESIGN Randomised control trial . HYPOTHESIS In patient perianal abscess incision drainage without pack subsequent cavity reduce patient discomfort without increase healing time recurrence compare management involve cavity packing . OUTCOME MEASURES - Length hospital stay - Time cavity heal - Recurrent abscess fistula formation - Pain score - Analgesia usage POPULATION All patient older 18 year present perianal abscess . ELIGIBILITY Exclusion criterion : - 18 year - unable give inform consent - abscess associate Crohn 's disease underlying cause - abscesses initial drainage consider inadequate ( skin open sufficiently allow drainage abscess cavity ) DURATION Until recruitment subject complete</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . INTRODUCTION 1.1 BACKGROUND Perianal abscesses common incidence 0.5-1 % . Some present emergency require surgery , place significant burden health resource . The mainstay management incision drainage . Traditionally residual cavity pack . On discharge , cavity packing require frequent change . This use considerable community nursing resource . Perianal abscess alternatively treat primary closure without pack cavity . Benefits treat without pack include great patient comfort acceptance reduce nursing requirement . However treat without pack yet widely accept , absence sufficient evidence safe effective . This study aim address issue . 1.2 RATIONALE FOR CURRENT STUDY - Question : In patient perianal abscess , incision drainage without pack subsequent cavity reduce patient discomfort without increase healing time recurrence compare management involve cavity pack ? - Hypothesis : Perianal abscess manage without cavity packing , increase heal time recurrence . - Note partly address Tonkin et al ( 2004 ) study underpowered . We intend sufficiently power study definitively answer question . 2 . STUDY OBJECTIVES - Assess whether statistically significant difference patient perianal abscess manage without cavity packing term : - Length hospital stay - Time cavity heal - Recurrent abscess fistula formation - Pain score - Analgesia usage 3 . STUDY DESIGN - This randomise controlled trial . - Due nature intervention ( pack ) , impossible either subject research team blind . - Duration : recruitment study remain open target number subject reach . - Number type subject : power calculation publish pilot study show demonstrate difference 10 % vs 20 % e.g . fistula recurrent abscess formation , 316 patient need recruit . We perform pilot study 20 patient group time calculate number subject recruit 3.1 STUDY OUTCOME MEASURES - Length hospital stay - Time cavity heal - Recurrent abscess fistula formation - Pain score - Analgesia usage 4 . PARTICIPANT ENTRY 4.1 PRE-REGISTRATION EVALUATIONS - Documentation duration symptom presentation . - Examination documentation abscess characteristic ( do time operation ) : size , site type . - Comorbidities 4.2 INCLUSION CRITERIA - Perianal abscess . - Over 18 year age . 4.3 EXCLUSION CRITERIA - Under 18 year age . - Those unable give inform consent . - Abscesses associate Crohn 's disease underlying cause . - Abscesses initial drainage consider inadequate ( skin open sufficiently allow drainage abscess cavity ) . 4.4 WITHDRAWAL CRITERIA - If patient want withdraw study point resume standardize treatment pathways 5 . ADVERSE EVENTS 5.1 DEFINITIONS Adverse Event ( AE ) : untoward medical occurrence patient clinical study subject . Serious Adverse Event ( SAE ) : untoward unexpected medical occurrence effect : â€¢ Results death - Is life-threatening - refers event subject risk death time event ; refer event hypothetically might cause death severe - Requires hospitalization , prolongation exist inpatient ' hospitalization - Results persistent significant disability incapacity - Is congenital anomaly birth defect Medical judgement exercise decide whether AE serious situation . Important AEs immediately life-threatening result death hospitalization may jeopardize subject may require intervention prevent one outcomes listed definition , also consider serious . 5.3 REPORTING PROCEDURES All adverse event report . Depending nature event reporting procedure follow . Any question concern adverse event reporting direct Chief Investigator first instance . 6 . ASSESSMENT AND FOLLOW-UP - Patients pack group dress change day 1 post-operatively . On discharge care transfer District Nurses daily dress care home . - Patients non-packing group initial haemostatic dressing remove day 1 post-operatively discharged superficial protective dress absorb discharge protect wound . - All patient review 2 weekly interval outpatient clinic cavity close skin completely re-epithelialized . At outpatient appointment , patient ask score pain previous two week standard 10cm Visual Analogue Scale pain . - Patients attend clinic interview telephone gather information list . - The end point patient discharge outpatient clinic complete healing ( describe ) development fistula recurrent abscess . 7 . STATISTICS AND DATA ANALYSIS - Data appropriate documentation store minimum 5 year completion study , include follow-up period . - The data test normal distribution analyze accordingly : If normally distribute , unpaired T-test perform continuous data ( time healing , length stay , pain score , morphine dose ) Fischer test perform categorical data ( fistula rate , recurrence , delay healing ) . - If normally distribute , Mann-Whitney U test perform place T-test . - The test two-tailed significance level 0.05 . - Following pilot study 40 patient perform power calculation however similar pilot study already publish indicates need 316 subject recruit 8.1 CONSENT Consent enter study must seek participant full explanation give , information leaflet offer time allow consideration . Signed participant consent obtain . The right participant refuse participate without give reason must respect . After participant enter study clinician remain free give alternative treatment specify protocol stage he/she feel participant 's best interest , reason record . In case participant remain within study purpose follow-up data analysis . All participant free withdraw time protocol treatment without give reason without prejudice treatment . 8.2 CONFIDENTIALITY The Chief Investigator preserve confidentiality participant take part study register Data Protection Act . 8.3 AUDITS The study may subject inspection audit Imperial College London remit sponsor regulatory body ensure adherence GCP NHS Research Governance Framework Health Social Care ( 2nd edition ) . 9 . STUDY MANAGEMENT The day-to-day management study coordinate Mr Mikael Sodergren . 10 . PUBLICATION POLICY All publication presentation relate study authorize Trial Management Group ( TMG ) . The first publication trial result name Trial Management Group , appropriately names author . If name author , include least trial 's Chief Investigator , Trial Coordinator .
