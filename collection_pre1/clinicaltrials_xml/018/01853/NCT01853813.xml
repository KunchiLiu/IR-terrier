	<brief_summary>Bevacizumab combination chemotherapy represent standard care first-line treatment patient advance colorectal cancer . Molecular predictive factor bevacizumab efficacy yet identify therefore selection patient likely benefit treatment approach possible . Retrospective analysis suggest LDH serum level may influence clinical activity anti-angiogenetic drug . Primary aim clinical trial prospectively ascertain whether bevacizumab combination chemotherapy improve clinical activity patient high LDH serum level compare patient normal LDH serum level</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The VEGF-driven tumour pathway demonstrate represent novel therapeutic target innovative class antineoplastic agent . Among antiangiogenetic-targeted treatment modality anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab become new standard care first-line treatment metastatic colorectal cancer . The biological link hypoxia , LDH level tumour-driven angiogenesis pathway abnormal activation hypoxia Inducible factor 1 α ( HIF1-α ) well establish . HIF1-α key transcription factor up-regulates series gene involve glycolytic metabolism , angiogenesis , cell survival erythropoiesis Accordingly biological assumption Azuma et al ( Azuma et al 2007 ) demonstrate high LDH serum level associate tumour over-expression VEGFA VEGFR-1 . As clinical consequence speculate LDH level may represent indirect indicator activate tumour angiogenesis ultimately bad prognosis We previously analyse role LDH pre-treatment serum level colorectal cancer patient receive first-line bevacizumab metastatic colorectal cancer treat first-line bevacizumab eligible . A control group include consecutive patient treat chemotherapy alone also consider . Pre-treatment LDH serum level collect case</detailed_description>
