	<detailed_description>Despite need consistent adherence medical care , youth live HIV ( YLWH ) suboptimal rate retention care adherence antiretroviral medication ( ARV ) treatment . There adherence study YLWH result mixed , great need development novel intervention . Results adult HIV adherence study indicate participant interested use technology-based method receptive toward intervention couple technological device motivational component . Pill take monitoring device find sensitive measure adherence ARV medication , lead sustain improvement adherence intrinsic motivation use alone . Building knowledge , study examine multi-level technology integrate medication monitoring device WITH interactive smartphone base app/game attractive engage YLWH . This multi-level approach integrate theory drive content novel , intuitive , technology improve HIV treatment adherence . In study , data opening pill bottle transfer wirelessly bottle cap text adherence send phone . This developmental project adapt refine smartphone app/game include content consistent Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills ( IMB ) Model . Creation adaptation occur in-depth interview YLWH ART ( n=25 ) open trial Intervention ( n=20 ) . While game , participant experience absorb action-oriented adventure increase information health ( e.g . knowledge HIV treatment ) , improve motivation ( e.g . action-figures experience health benefit adherence ) , build skill ( e.g . utilize clinician partner ) . A small randomized control pilot study ( 24 week ) among 60 YLWH examine preliminary efficacy IMB Gaming Adherence Intervention ( integration smart cap IMB inform app/game ) compare comparison group receive smart cap smartphone IMB game , adherence biological measure .</detailed_description>
