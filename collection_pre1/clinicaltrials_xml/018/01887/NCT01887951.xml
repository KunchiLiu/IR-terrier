	<brief_summary>Introduction Current practice Singapore Emergency Ambulance Service ( EAS ) include use analgesia deliver via inhalation Enthanox ( Nitrous Oxide ) . However difficulty administer Enthanox on-scene due add weight carry bulky cylinder tank . It common delay administration analgesia . Inhaled methoxyflurane ( Penthrox ) potential agent early administration analgesia Singapore Civil Defense Force ( SCDF ) EAS . It extensively use pre-hospital setting Australia . However data use analgesic agent general limit publish controlled trial methoxyflurane analgesic role . Intramuscular ( IM ) tramadol common medication use hospital set analgesia . It well proven , simple deliver control drug . Aim To compare Penthrox Tramadol treatment acute pain patient transport SCDF EAS . Methodology The trial recruit 400 eligible patient 1 year ( 200 Penthrox 200 tramadol ) . Patients manage SCDF EAS treatment acute pain meet eligibility criterion recruit study . Half SCDF 's 30 ambulance ( 15 ambulance ) , randomly assign , equip train carry new medication ( Penthrox ) . The half ( 15 ambulance ) , train equipped tramadol . Allocation per station level . After 6 month , cross Penthrox tramadol respectively . All paramedic train use medication , pain scale Ramsey score , record patient 's pain , sedation score patient satisfaction part routine clinical practice . All patient follow review Emergency Department hospital record medication relate adverse effect . Hypothesis The investigator hypothesize patient acute pain ( pain score ≥3 ) , present ambulance service musculo-skeletal trauma ( limbs back ) ; pain relief inhale methoxyflurane equivalent IM tramadol , assess Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) 5 , 10 , 15 20 min start study treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction Current practice Singapore Emergency Ambulance Service ( EAS ) include use analgesia deliver via inhalation Enthanox ( Nitrous Oxide ) . However difficulty administer Enthanox on-scene due add weight carry bulky cylinder tank . It common delay administration analgesia . In addition , problem storage , leakage , maintenance occupational exposure EAS crew member . Therefore , need good standard care treatment . Inhaled methoxyflurane ( Penthrox ) potential agent early administration analgesia EAS . It extensively use pre-hospital setting Australia . However data use analgesic agent general limit publish controlled trial methoxyflurane analgesic role . Intramuscular ( IM ) tramadol common medication use hospital set analgesia . It well proven , simple deliver control drug . We intend conduct clinical evaluation trial comparing use inhale Penthrox IM Tramadol early pain relief . Objective &amp; Hypothesis Primary objective : To compare Penthrox ( methoxyflurane ) Tramadol treatment acute pain patient transport Singapore Civil Defense Force ( SCDF ) EAS respect : - Pain Score assess Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) 5,10 , 15 20 min start study treatment - Time arrived scene delivery first analgesia - Time onset analgesia ( arrive scene ≥ 3 point reduction pain score assess VAS ) Secondary Objective : - To understand patient ' perception pain , satisfaction pain management , use analgesic inhaler compare IM tramadol treatment acute pain . - To understand staff satisfaction pain management , ease use analgesic inhaler compare IM tramadol treatment acute pain . - To assess Ramsay sedation score 5 , 10 , 15 20 min start study treatment - Vital sign ( i.e . Respiratory rate , heart rate , blood pressure GCS ) Methods Study Design A phase , prospective , non-randomised , before-after evaluation study compare Penthrox ( Methoxyflurane ) Tramadol patient acute pain manage SCDF EAS . The trial recruit 400 eligible patient 1 year ( 200 Penthrox 200 tramadol ) . 200 sample Penthrox provide free charge Medical Developments International ( MDI ) , Australian company , evaluation trial . Patients manage SCDF EAS treatment acute pain meet eligibility criterion recruit study . Intramuscular tramadol purchase SCDF implementation trial . Half SCDF 's 30 ambulance ( 15 ambulance ) , randomly assign , equip train carry new medication ( Penthrox ) . The half ( 15 ambulance ) , train equip IM tramadol . Allocation per station level . After 6 month , two separate cohort ambulance cross administer Penthrox Tramadol respectively . This do order minimize potential patient selection bias ambulance crew operator bias arise two 6-monthly time period . All paramedic train use medication , pain scale Ramsey score , record patient 's pain , sedation score patient staff satisfaction part routine clinical practice . In case one study drug use cross-over period , patient ineligible either drug , SCDF ambulance still carry Enthanox back analgesia . SGH submit ethic application Centralised Institutional Review Board ( CIRB ) behalf SCDF recruit case present SCDF , irrespective destination hospital . This SCDF IRB . All patient follow review Emergency Department hospital record medication relate adverse effect . Enrollment Patients Patients give treatment eligibility criterion meet treatment indicate protocol . For patient meet inclusion exclusion criterion either new treatment , Enthanox still keep ambulance study period back analgesia . No write consent seek part routine clinical care . Team member Contribution SCDF staff member enrol eligible participant administer study drug . The SGH study team provide clinical input protocol , physician oversight , train paramedic , data quality control , analysis data interpretation result etc . Quality Assurance This study include follow specific element quality assurance : - Development standard protocol perform data collection follow-up activity - Development adherence detailed Standard Operation Procedures ( SOP ) - Use standardize form uniform criterion patient recruitment - Standardized data processing , edit generation edit statement - Regular communication study investigator resolve question - Internal external monitoring data collection Additional step ensure data quality include : range check verification build data entry system sequence logic check examination variable . Human Subjects Instructions Risk Reduction - A formal education train program conduct paramedic administer treatment patient . This include didactic practical training session , competency certification allow administer treatment . Paramedics also teach monitor patient , watch adverse effect treat . A formal education train program conduct investigator conduct survey reduce risk regard confidentiality . All subject ' identifier remove database protect subject ' confidentiality . Risk/Benefit - Comparison Penthrox Tramadol help advise drug use standard drug EAS treatment acute pain patient . This study potential change practice Singapore beyond , allow patient earlier relief pain suffering . Compensation Plan - No compensation provide patient family member . Informed Consent Issues - Apply waiver consent study . Only collect patient ' pain scale information SCDF EAS . Therefore , pose additional risk patient . All patient identifier subsequently remove dataset .</detailed_description>
