	<brief_title>Phase I Study Of Vincristine , Doxorubicin , And Dexamethasone ( VXD ) Plus Ixazomib In Adults With Relapsed Or Refractory Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia/Lymphoma , Lymphoblastic Lymphoma Or Mixed Phenotype Acute Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In phase I study , escalate dos MLN9708 combine fix dose mVXD regimen . MLN 9708 administer day 1 , 8 , 15 . If patient experience DLT dose MLN maybe reduce next dose level day 8 day 15 patient . DLT would grade 3 toxicity think probably definitely related MLN9708 . Three patient treat per dose level unless dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) observe . The start dose MLN9708 2.3 mg orally day 1 , 8 15 . If toxicity see level dose may reduce 1.5 mg ( dose level -1 ) . If DLT see first 3 patient , dose increase 3 mg 4 mg orally day 1 , 8 15 classic 3 +3 phase I design . We attempt increase dose beyond 4 mg orally , achieve acceptable toxicity , would accept recommended phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) . 0 3 DLTs would allow escalation next dose level . 1 3 DLTs require expand six patient ; 1 6 DLTs allow escalation . 2 DLTs require dose de-escalation . The maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) high dose administer 1 DLT observe . All patient evaluate hematopoetic stem cell transplantation . If patient achieve CR eligible HSCT , proceed HSCT . If eligible , donor identify HSCT delay , patient achieve benefit , treatment maybe repeat discretion investigator . A total 9-18 patient enrol study . The study duration would 2 year .</detailed_description>
