	<brief_summary>No randomized trial compare long-term outcome follow endoscopic open carpal tunnel release patient carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) . The investigator conduct single-center randomized control trial January 1998 December 2002 , include 128 patient ( 25 60 year ) clinically diagnose electrophysiologically confirm idiopathic CTS . The outcome measure include validated CTS symptom severity functional status scale complete baseline 1 year postoperatively . The trial show 1-year outcome open endoscopic carpal tunnel release regard symptom function equivalent . This extend follow-up randomized trial primarily measure symptom outcomes 10-15 year surgery . A questionnaire sent mail patient . The questionnaire consist CTS symptom severity functional status scale , 6-item CTS symptom scale ( CTS-6 ) , 11-item disability arm , shoulder hand ( QuickDASH ) , 2-item palmar pain scale , visual analog scale treatment satisfaction . The patient also ask whether undergone surgery CTS contralateral hand operation randomize trial . The complete questionnaire scan database . The score different scale calculate . Analysis include comparison open endoscopic group well within-group change score 1 year 10-15 year .</brief_summary>
