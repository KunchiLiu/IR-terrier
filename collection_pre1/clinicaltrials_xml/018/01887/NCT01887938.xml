	<brief_title>Open-Label Extension Study Evaluating Safety Efficacy HGT-1110 Patients With Metachromatic Leukodystrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Metachromatic leukodystrophy ( MLD ) inherit , autosomal recessive disorder lipid metabolism characterize deficient activity lysosomal enzyme , arylsulfatase A ( ASA ) . MLD rare disease occur part world . The estimate overall incidence disease western world approximately 1 100,000 live birth varies geographic location . There approved therapy MLD . This study multicenter open-label study design evaluate safety efficacy outcomes HGT-1110 administer intrathecally child MLD participate dose escalation study , HGT-MLD-070 , Week 40 receive study drug every week ( EOW ) . Treatment group identical HGT-MLD-070 , ie , patient assign Cohort 1 Study HGT-MLD-070 continue receive dose 10 mg , patient assign Cohort 2 Study HGT-MLD-070 continue receive dose 30 mg , patient assign Cohorts 3 4 Study HGT-MLD-070 continue receive dose 100 mg . Patients Cohort 4 exclusively receive drug product produce Process B Study HGT-MLD-070 continue receive drug product study . Patients enrol study Cohorts 1 3 Study HGT-MLD-070 transition Process B necessary approval obtain . In HGT-MLD-071 , patient 10 mg dose cohort experience disease progression , determine Investigator , increase 30 mg dose agreement Medical Monitor . Based interim analysis result HGT-MLD-070 ( Cohorts 1-3 ) , dose HGT-1110 increase 100 mg patient HGT-MLD-071 necessary approval obtain .</detailed_description>
