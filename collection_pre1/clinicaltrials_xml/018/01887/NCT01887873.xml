	<brief_summary>The study design assess safety Hyaluronan Thiomer i.o . implant patient primary open angle glaucoma undergo combine phacoemulsification - non penetrate deep sclerectomy procedure . In study , Hyaluronan Thiomer i.o . implant combined surgery cataract non - penetrate deep sclerectomy group 16 patient primary open angle glaucoma clinically significant cataract . Given considerable number glaucoma patient also suffer cataract , reasonable test Hyaluronan Thiomer i.o . combined procedure phacoemulsification deep sclerectomy . This also importance combined procedure avoids need second operation group patient . Finally , show combined phacoemulsification - deep sclerectomy induce risk compare deep sclerectomy alone ( open phase I study ) . Safety assess base occurrence adverse event . Efficacy assessment perform every visit efficacy analysis include : - Proportion subject study time point need additional IOP lower drug therapy achieve IOP reduction value &lt; 21 mmHg . If subject need one drug achieve target IOP , number drug need achieve adequate IOP reduction record . - Proportion subject time point need Neodymium : YAG goniopuncture achieve IOP reduction value &lt; 21 mmHg .</brief_summary>
