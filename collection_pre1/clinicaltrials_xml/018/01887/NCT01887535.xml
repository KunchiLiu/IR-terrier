	<brief_title>A Study Investigate Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics , Pharmacodynamics JNJ-54861911 Healthy Elderly Participants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This multiple ascend dose study anticipate enroll 5 cohort ( small group ) . Cohorts 1 4 conduct double-blind ( neither investigator participant know treatment participant receives ) , randomize ( participant assign different treatment base chance ) , placebo-controlled ( placebo inactive substance compare drug test whether drug real effect clinical trial ) study . Cohort 5 perform open-label study ( people know identity intervention ) , use recently make available solid dose formulation JNJ-54861911 . The study design evaluate safety ( side effect ) , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( drug absorb body , distribute within body , remove body time , ie , body drug ) , pharmacodynamics ( drug body ) JNJ-54861911 . The study population consist approximately 38 healthy elderly participant divide among approximately 5 cohort . For participant study consist 3 phase : eligibility screen examination phase ( 28 2 day prior first dose administration ) , 14-day double-blind ( Cohorts 1 4 ) open-label ( Cohort 5 ) treatment phase , follow-up examination phase ( within 7 14 day last dose administration ) . Participants successfully complete screen examination consider eligible participate admit clinical unit Day -1 administration study drug . Cohorts 1 4 consist 8 participant . Within cohort , participant randomly assign double-blind treatment oral suspension JNJ-54861911 3 mg , 10 mg , 30 mg , 80 mg ( n=6/cohort ) match placebo ( n=2/cohort ) . Cohorts 1 4 use dose escalation assess maximal tolerate dose use oral suspension JNJ-54861911 . Cohort 5 consist 6 participant receive open-label treatment single solid dose formulation JNJ 54861911 25 mg. Cohort 5 ass recently make available solid dose formulation ( strength 25 mg ) similar pharmacokinetic property pharmacodynamic effect oral suspension dose level range assess earlier ( Cohorts 1 4 ) find safe well tolerate . All cohort ( Cohorts 1 5 ) follow study assessment . Participants administer single dos study medication Days 1 14 . Following and/or dose level study ( cohort ) , observe safety tolerability profile ongoing cohort previous cohort evaluate dos increase observed safety tolerability profile acceptable . Plasma pharmacokinetic profile ongoing cohort ( include Day 7 ) plasma cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) pharmacokinetic profile well CSF plasma amyloid beta ( AÎ² ) profile previous cohort ( include Day 14 ) applicable , support dose increase decision . Actual dose level well magnitude dose escalation depend result ongoing single-ascending dose study ( 54861911ALZ1001 ) , observe safety tolerability profile , well observed exposure . Participants discharge clinical unit last study assessment Day 16 approximately 24 hour indwell catheter remove , whatever occurs later . If discharge Day 16 , participant return clinical unit Day 17 ( 72 hour post-dose Day 14 ) plasma pharmacokinetic sampling . Safety assessment perform throughout study . The maximal study duration participant exceed 8 week .</detailed_description>
