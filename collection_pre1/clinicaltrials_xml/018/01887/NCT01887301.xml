Subject willing name notify responsible authority participation study , applicable individual country . Subject willing allow primary care practitioner consultant , appropriate , notified participation study . Groups 1 2 ( mild moderate hepatic impairment ) Clinical feature consistent confirm clinical diagnosis mild moderate liver impairment . ChildPugh clinical assessment score consistent degree hepatic impairment . Clinical evidence stable hepatic impairment , define clinically significant change disease status within last 30 day , document patient ' recent medical history . Otherwise consider healthy general determine past medical history , physical examination , vital sign , ECG , laboratory test screen . Platelet count &gt; 50,000 X 109/L screen baseline .

History clinically significant drug allergy ; know hypersensitivity study drug drug similar study drug . Any surgical medical condition ( hepatic impairment ) might significantly alter absorption , distribution , metabolism excretion drug , may jeopardize subject case participation study . Any history significant bleeding haemorrhagic tendency . However , subject history bleed tendency secondary hepatic impairment exclude base Principal Investigators ' discretion . History immunocompromisation , include know history human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity .
