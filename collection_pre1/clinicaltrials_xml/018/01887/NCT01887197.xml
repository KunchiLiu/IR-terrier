	<brief_summary>The investigator develop new nuclear medicine imaging technique measure liquid absorption airway apply screen new medication develop treat cystic fibrosis ( CF ) . The investigator believe absorption small molecule radiopharmaceutical Indium 111 diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid ( In-DTPA ) indicate change liquid absorption airway demonstrate whether new CF medication effective . In study investigator determine whether image technique demonstrate similar result repeat different day . They also determine result change subject utilize several common CF medication .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) autosomal recessive genetic disease , cause mutation Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator ( CFTR ) impair ion transport epithelial surface . This result accumulation dehydrate secretion airways chronic infection inflammation lung , lead significant morbidity mortality . The investigator understand CF pathogenesis increase substantially many new target therapy develop treat disease , however , measurement clinical efficacy use evaluate therapy require long trial demonstrate effect . New translational technique need ass change basic aspect disease allow rapid screen disease-altering therapy . The investigator recently develop novel aerosol-based imaging technique measure liquid absorption airways - central pathophysiological process relate CFTR dysfunction . The investigator propose airway liquid hyper-absorption key link cellular defect ion fluid transport progressive airway dysfunction CF . Thus The investigator technique may provide measure disease severity rapid indication therapeutic correction advance currently available outcome measure .</detailed_description>
