	<brief_summary>This innovative study involve use probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy , new medical imaging technology never use surgical indication date . Virtual biopsy ( pCLE image ) compare histopathology analysis . This study focus evaluation rectal tumor margin . The hypothesis pCLE allow identification rectal tumor margin , comparable histopathology . In future , decision resection margin could rely intraoperative pCLE exam . The propose study feasibility study , first indication rectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Rectal Tumor Margin Using Confocal Endomicroscopy Comparison Histopathology</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Defining limit resection rectal tumor often imprecise . The identification bank tumor becomes critical come decision potentially sacrifice sphincter surgical resection . Currently tumor margin identify direct examination surgeon , use flexible endoscopy . Endoscopy confocal microscopy could provide precise image tumor enable reliable definition resection margin . There would direct benefit patient , sphincter could preserve . pCLE ( probe-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy ) already widely use colorectal lesion , value proposition demonstrate validated several study . This study first use pCLE intraoperatively . Study result may lead use pCLE validate surgical procedure decision ( resection margin ) revision patient management colorectal cancer , adapt neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy patient 's responder status . The goal identify tumor margin ( low pole ) optimize resection margin , limit resection healthy rectal tissue optimal anal sphincter preservation . Moreover , determine optimal date surgery follow neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy rectal cancer discuss consensus reach . Therefore , date , formal evaluation tumor response . This partly due lack information tumor state tumor evolution time , end radiochemotherapy surgery . Histological follow tumor would provide support information fill gap . However , frequent tumor biopsy possible . Alternatively , probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy ( pCLE ) could allow sequential analysis tumor response . Response treatment could assess use define optimal date surgical resection , depend patient respond status treatment . Responding patient would undergo surgery later date non-responders , surgery could perform early . Benefits study lay accurate definition resection margin , associate potential therapeutic impact anal sphincter preservation definition optimal date rectal tumor resection , base response status radiochemotherapy . Study interest : - Microscopic structure tumor analyze cellular microvascular level compare healthy mucosa . - Evolution response follow radiochemotherapy assess , help classify patient responders/non responder . - pCLE result compare histopathology result pre-treatment resection biopsy . - Images gather image modality ( WLE , pCLE , EUS ) along histopathology result combine create atlas database rectal tumor .</detailed_description>
