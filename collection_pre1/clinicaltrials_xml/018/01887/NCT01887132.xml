	<brief_summary>Background : - Some child autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) normal sleep cycle . Some child spend little time rapid eye movement ( REM ) stage sleep . Some study suggest less time REM sleep associate learn behavior problem . Donepezil medication use treat Alzheimer disease . Donepezil increase REM sleep adult different disorder . A small study show Donepezil also increase REM sleep child ASD . Researchers want see Donepezil improve communication skill social interaction child ASD . They also want see change symptom seem come change REM sleep . Objectives : - To see medication , Donepezil , improve way communication skill social interaction develop young child autism spectrum disorder . Eligibility : - Children 22 44 month age ASD . Design : - Participants screen blood test , heart test , sleep study . During sleep study , child sleep darkened room 2 night electrode body tube nose . Parents sleep room child . A technician monitor room night . - Participants take study medication day . - Treatment monitor visit every 3 month . At visit participant take blood test , heart test , behavior test . Participants 2 sleep study . - Participation end 18 month .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Drug Donepezil Sleep Enhancement Behavioral Change Children With Autism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>. Objective The objective study investigate efficacy donepezil improve developmental trajectory core behavioral domain specific autism , namely reciprocal social interaction communication . ii . Study population 90 child autism spectrum disorder age 24 50 month screen via polysomnogram find 45 relative REM deficiency . This group divide two arm drug versus placebo . Allowing 22 % drop rate expect 17 group complete study . Additionally , enroll 16 child ASD meet criterion relative REM deficiency open label arm ascertain whether donepezil beneficial behavior group . iii . Design The proposal 6 month treatment trial 2.5 mg donepezil/placebo/day follow 12 month longitudinal follow-up . The primary study endpoint examination autism core symptom sleep architecture 12 month . iv . Outcome measure The primary outcome measure : An improvement Expressive Language Receptive Language subscales Mullen Scales Early Learning ( MSEL ) 12 month . 1 . Secondary outcome measure : An improvement Expressive Language Receptive Language subscales Mullen Scales 18 month . 2 . An improvement severity scale Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ( ADOS ) 6 , 12 18 month . 3 . An improvement Vineland 3 , 6 , 12 18 month 4 . We also measure change REM sleep parameter 6 , 12 18 month relation improvement behavioral index . 5 . An exploratory analysis investigate whether normalization REM parameter also improve measurement sleep quality child autism .</detailed_description>
