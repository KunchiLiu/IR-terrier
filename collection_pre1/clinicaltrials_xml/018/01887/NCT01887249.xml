	<brief_summary>10-day sequential therapy sufficient overcome tough situation H. pylori eradication Korea due high antimicrobial resistance . The present investigator assume double duration second phase sequential therapy might potent bactericidal efficacy previous 10-day sequential regimen . But 15-day regimen initial 5-day PPI amoxicillin follow remain 10-day PPI , clarithromycin metronidazole ever test . Moreover , whether extend sequential therapy 15-day might effective 10-day sequential therapy unknown especially Korea . From background , present investigator prepare clinical trial regard modify sequential therapy extend treatment duration 15 day compare previous 10-day sequential therapy regimen .
