	<detailed_description>Varicella infection one common childhood infectious disease .

Most hospitalization varicella occur child previously healthy cause significant long term sequele mortality immunocompetent well immunocompromised child . Incidence varicella related hospitalization rate change accord climate also presence vaccination . WHO recommend routine childhood varicella vaccination consider country disease relatively important public health socioeconomic problem however live attenuate varicella introduce childhood immunization programme Australia , Canada , Germany , Greece , Qatar , Republic Korea , Saudi Arabia , Taiwan , United States , Uruguay , part Italy Spain . Clinically statistically significant reduction varicella-related hospitalization child adult associate childhood varicella immunization correspond significant decrease hospital charge . Epidemiological information varicella complication child essential develop immunization recommendation strategy . Economic analysis varicella immunization sensitive cost hospitalize case , need validate varicella relate hospitalization data country-based level . The data also provide baseline data routine varicella immunization evaluate overall impact cost-effectiveness varicella immunization program . Knowledge cause incidence varicella relate hospitalization limit center-specific Turkey provide sufficiently accurate information . Varicella infection commonly see child Turkey VZV seroprevalence increase age 70 % age 7 year 90 % 15-19 year . Varicella vaccine available private practice Turkey estimate coverage lower 10 % . The aim multicenter study ( VARICOMP study ) estimate annual incidence pediatric varicella related hospitalization , describe complication estimate annual mortality cost child .</detailed_description>
