	<brief_summary>A computational model human sound production base high quality anatomic measurement physical law sound propagation accomplish without comprehensive data set include 3D-images speaker 's anatomy simultaneous record speech . Since computational model separate model vocal fold vocal tract , patient undergo orthognathic surgery optimal test object model development . Vocal fold remain unchanged substantial change take place vocal tract . Moreover , since aim research predict acoustic change speech due operation head neck area , orthognathic patient group par excellence example prediction problem . If model show give valuable information pre-operationally , many patient group could benefit result .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Computational Modeling Prediction Acoustic Changes Vowel Production Due Orthognathic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Orthognathic surgery deal correction abnormalities facial tissue . The underlying cause abnormality may present birth acquire life result distort growth trauma . Orthodontic treatment alone adequate many case due severity deformity . In typical operation , position either one jaw ( mandible maxilla ) jaw surgically change relation skull base . The movement jaw position varies usually 5-15 mm either anterior posterior direction . Such considerable movement profound effect shape volume vocal tract result detectable change acoustic . Although surgery involve mandibular maxillary bone , change occur also position shape respective soft tissue hyoid bone , well . For project , 20 adult patient ( 10 woman 10 men ) undergo orthognathic surgery enrol . Exclusion criterion include disease condition MRI examination contraindicate ( .e.g . pace maker ) , severe speech hearing impairment , situation patient difficulty complete task define research protocol . Furthermore , patient segmental surgery jaw perform connection orthognathic surgery exclude . A specific pre-selection criterion patient presence numerous dental amalgam filling may cause artifact MR image .</detailed_description>
