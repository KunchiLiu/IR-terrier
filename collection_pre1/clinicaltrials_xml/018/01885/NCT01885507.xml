	<brief_summary>Protective ventilation ( association tidal volume &lt; 8 ml/kg positive end expiratory pressure ) poorly use severe brain-injured patient . Moreover , systematic approach extubation may decrease rate extubation failure enhance outcomes brain-injured patient . We hypothesize medical education implementation evidence-base care bundle associate protective ventilation systemic approach extubation reduce duration mechanical ventilation brain-injured patient .</brief_summary>
