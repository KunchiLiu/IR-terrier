	<brief_title>The Addition Non-Invasive Ventilation To Airway Clearance Techniques In Adults With Cystic Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) genetic disorder alter ion transport across cell membrane characterise production thicken bodily secretion , affect function organ pancreas lung . Within lung , thicken mucus alters normal mucocillary clearance mechanism result airway obstruction , mucus plug recurrent infection . The cycle recurrent infection subsequent inflammation think major mechanism towards damage lung tissue occurrence fibrosis , decrease lung function , lower tissue oxygenation eventually lead respiratory failure death . Optimisation removal airway secretion therefore integral part management CF order try prevent complication . Traditionally , variety approach usually combine include mucolytic hydrator therapy make secretion less viscous , chest physiotherapy mobilise secretion improve airway clearance . There many chest physiotherapy airway clearance technique ( ACT ) available include breathe method Active Cycle Breathing Techniques ( ACBT ) Autogenic Drainage ( AD ) adjuncts Positive Expiratory Pressure ( PEP ) , High Frequency Chest Oscillation ( `` Vest '' ) , oscillatory device Flutter Acapella . Research show difference effectiveness technique , long perform correctly regularly , therefore choice ACT depend upon assessment patient train physiotherapist discussion individual . With advance disease infection , often effectiveness ACTs decrease due patient fatigue , shortness breath overwhelm amount secretion . At time necessary re-assess ACTs , addition positive pressure airway clearance technique show decrease patient fatigue respiratory rate clearance . One study also demonstrate improvement oxygenation respiratory muscle strength use positive pressure ACT . While study report increase sputum expectorate addition positive pressure , ability augment great tidal volume positive pressure think mechanism could improve sputum clearance . Clinical experience Royal Brompton hospital indicate alteration pressure flow rate rest setting , sputum clearance appear easier effective ; investigator aim explore observation objectively study . Research Question : Does addition non-invasive ventilation ( Breas , I-Sleep 25 ) supplementary positive pressure normal airway clearance technique improve sputum clearance stable adult patient cystic fibrosis ? Hypothesis The inclusion non-invasive ventilation addition patient 's normal airway clearance technique lead improvement subjective ease clearance work breathe airway clearance objectively increase sputum clearance , well well tolerated patient adjunct airway clearance .</detailed_description>
