	<brief_summary>Muscle mass normally maintain regulated balance process protein synthesis ( i.e . make new muscle protein ) protein breakdown ( break old muscle protein ) . Proteins compose amino acid know amino acid increase muscle protein synthesis . However , amino acid . Essential amino acid one must consume food , non-essential amino acid make body . Interestingly , essential amino acid require increase rate muscle protein synthesis . In addition , essential amino acid leucine appear particularly important regulate protein synthesis . However , leucine able increase protein synthesis entirely understood . Previously , show 20-25 g high-quality protein , find milk ( whey ) , appear amount protein maximize rate muscle protein synthesis perform bout resistance exercise . Thus , aim measure synthesis new muscle protein ingest different amount protein amino acid . We measure muscle protein synthesis consumption beverage participant randomize leg do exercise ( ie . rest leg ) leg do resistance exercise . Amino acid 'strung-together ' make protein . The 'essential ' amino acid must consume food body make , thus consume eat protein rich food like milk chicken . Leucine , isoleucine , valine simply 3 8 essential amino acid make dietary protein . Unlike essential amino acid , 'non-essential ' amino acid may synthesize body , however also present protein rich food like chicken milk . We aim determine leucine content find 25 g whey protein primarily responsible maximize muscle protein synthesis rest follow resistance exercise . We also wish determine muscle gene metabolism respond protocol .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The process muscle protein synthesis ( MPS ) muscle protein breakdown ( MPB ) occur concurrently . This constant protein turnover allow muscle fiber change protein structure load demand diet change . The plasticity skeletal muscle respond alter load contractile pattern evidence capacity remodel fiber undergo . It quite well documented example mitochondrial content increase endurance-type work . In contrast , heavy load lead less change mitochondrial content increase myofibrillar protein . All aforementioned phenotypic adaptation represent re-patterning muscle 's genetic expression pattern , protein translation , process breakdown exist protein structure 'insert ' new protein . A persistent muscle protein turnover also provide constant mechanism protein 'maintenance ' remove damage protein replace new protein . Damage proteins come oxidation simply mechanical damage due high force lengthen contraction . Regardless mechanism balance process muscle protein synthesis ( MPS ) muscle protein breakdown ( MPB ) determine net gain , loss , change protein myofiber .</detailed_description>
