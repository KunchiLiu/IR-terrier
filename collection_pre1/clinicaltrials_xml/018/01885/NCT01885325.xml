	<detailed_description>Obesity rate 3-5 year-old American child increase dramatically recent decade . Concurrent alarm trend , time spend young child preschool setting increase time spent unstructured play decrease . Recent study show child preschool engage primarily sedentary activity . Nonetheless , intervention design increase PA decrease sedentary behavior evaluate preschool child . The propose investigation test multicomponent intervention design increase physical activity energy expenditure ( PAEE ) 3-5 year-old child . Sixteen preschools randomly assign intervention control group . 500 child , two annual wave ~250 child , participate measurement protocol baseline exposure intervention 9 month . Child-level measure include moderate-to-vigorous PA , sedentary behavior , PAEE measure accelerometry ; height , weight waist circumference ; demographic . The intervention consist four component : Move IN ( physical education indoor activity programming ) , Move OUT ( recess structure outdoor activity ) , Move Learn ( PA classroom , academic lesson ) , enhance social environment promote PA . The study 's intervention coordinator work preschool director , teacher , assistant teacher facilitate intervention implementation provide training , material , ongoing support feedback . An extensive process evaluation document extent intervention implement . Effects intervention PA , sedentary behavior , PAEE , weight status determine . In addition , study examine factor associate change physical activity , sedentary behavior , physical activity energy expenditure body mass index school year preschool child .</detailed_description>
