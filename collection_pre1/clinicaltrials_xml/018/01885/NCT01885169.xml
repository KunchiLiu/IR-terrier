	<brief_summary>Influenza ( `` flu '' ) one common respiratory virus associate respiratory deterioration child adolescent cystic fibrosis . These deterioration usually mean antibiotic , hospitalization , worsen pulmonary function test . A new flu vaccine recently approve use Canada ( Flumist® ) . What particular flu vaccine spray nose , mimic influenza usually infect u . This particular vaccine protect child adolescent much good regular injectable flu shot . This new vaccine give &gt; 2,000 healthy child &gt; 2,000 child asthma well tolerate . The investigator want know Flumist® well tolerate child CF cause worsen respiratory symptom . The investigator conduct study participant receive Flumist® nose . This study particularly important result provide safety information vaccine efficacious population need safe easy administer protection flu .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>LAIV ( Flumist® ) Administration CF Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The literature demonstrate significant impact influenza disease course child cystic fibrosis ( CF ) superior efficacy live-attenuated influenza vaccine ( LAIV - Flumist® ) compare trivalent inactivate vaccine ( TIV ) healthy asthmatic child adolescent . LAIV recently approve use Canada people age 2-59 year . CF describe hyper-inflammatory disorder , abnormal inflammatory signaling , excessive inflammatory response , impairment resolution inflammation could risk development adverse event LAIV . Given impact influenza CF patient , likelihood superior protection LAIV , hyper-inflammatory status CF patient could increase risk adverse event , scarcity data safety LAIV use population , assessment LAIV 's safety profile CF patient necessary determine whether anticipated benefit associate LAIV use outweigh potential risk , mainly respiratory deterioration . Our study specifically aim : Aim 1 : Explore mucosal inflammatory response participant expose LAIV : Using self-procured nasal swab 75 participant CF ( 30 previously vaccinate 45 LAIV naïve ) 45 healthy sibling , investigator aim explore : ( ) inflammatory response profile patient without CF LAIV ( b ) participant ' inflammatory profile differ whether report respiratory deterioration LAIV . As viral infection show induce cytokine production ( IL-1b IL-6 , TNFa CXCL-8 [ IL-8 ] ) nasal secretion , expression 4 inflammatory marker profile use multiplex cytokine detection kit LAIV participant without CF . The inflammatory signature compare patient with/without CF with/without respiratory deterioration . Aim 2 : Determine LAIV efficacy prevent shed viral strain upon challenge : Using 75 participant CF 45 healthy sibling aim 1 , investigator compare proportion child shed vaccine strain among LAIV naïve LAIV experience . The clinical efficacy extrapolate efficacy prevent shed derive 1 - ( % shed LAIV experienced/ % shed LAIV naïve ) . Aim 3 : Assess LAIV safety patient CF : Compare incidence severe AEFI follow LAIV child CF vaccinate LAIV previous season ( n = 70 ) compare without prior vaccination LAIV ( n = 45 ) . Using self-controlled case-series design , investigator compare incidence AEFI at-risk period ( Day 1-28 post LAIV ) non at-risk period ( Days 29-56 ) . These incidence rate ratio compare child CF LAIV experience LAIV naïve . Methods : The cohort child CF vaccinate LAIV follow 56 day phone development severe adverse event follow immunization ( AEFI ) . Both period ( 4 week ) monitor use methodology : diary monitoring symptom hospital chart . The cohort child without CF vaccinate LAIV follow 8 day phone ( one phone call day 8 ) development severe AEFIs . A subgroup participant CF ( 30 LAIV experience MCH 45 LAIV naïve BC ) 45 participant without CF recruit also provide self-procured nasal swab day 0 ( LAIV ) , day 1,2 , 4 , 7 inflammatory marker viral shed . Knowledge gain project use determine LAIV safety child CF , patient population influenza major health impact could greatly benefit recommendation LAIV preferential use . Moreover , intranasal route administration make vaccine acceptable patient need yearly vaccination , thereby potentially increase vaccination coverage . Patients CF also population risk adverse event LAIV high , give baseline respiratory condition inflammatory dysregulation . Therefore , LAIV well tolerate population , investigator could generalize LAIV preferential use pediatric population chronic condition .</detailed_description>
