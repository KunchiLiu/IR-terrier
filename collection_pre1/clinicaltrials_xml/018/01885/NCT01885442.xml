	<brief_summary>Background : Patients intensive care unit ( ICU ) sick hospital , need advanced life-support . Survivors critical illness vulnerable weakness disability . Up 1 4 severe leg weakness impair quality life long 5 year ICU discharge . In-bed cycling employ special equipment attache patient 's hospital bed , allow gentle leg exercise ICU . The investigator offer patient in-bed cycle need breathing machine , help recover weakness fast possible . Before large trial test in-bed cycling reduces disability , data safety ( Is safe ? ) feasibility ( Can investigators ? ) need . Objectives : To study safety feasibility in-bed leg cycle critically ill patient need breathe machine . Methods : Adult patient admit ICU need breathe machine expect survive ICU stay eligible . Specially trained physiotherapist provide patient 30 minute in-bed cycling day ICU . Outcomes : The investigator study ( 1 ) Safety : heart rate breathing pattern patient in-bed cycling , carefully monitor safety . ( 2 ) Feasibility : whether patient cycle day ICU stay , whether patient family agree part study , whether investigator ass patient ' strength ICU hospital discharge . Relevance : As Canadian population age , demand breathe machine acute illness increase dramatically . Effective method physiotherapy need critically ill patient minimize muscle weakness , speed recovery , improve quality life . This pilot study first several future large study in-bed cycling ICU . This program research help patient need life support regain strength recover fast possible critical illness .</brief_summary>
