Subjects receive WHO step II Step III analgesic medication constipation induce , worsen opioid medication , show 1. subject 's medical need regular intake laxative least 3 bowel evacuation per week , le 3 bowel evacuation take laxative , respectively . 2. subject 's selfassessment constipation induce worsened current prestudy opioid medication . 4 . Documented history moderate severe , chronic cancer pain require around theclock opioid therapy ( start dose oxycodone PR 2080 mg/day ) &amp; likely benefit WHO step III opioid therapy duration study . Subjects must willing discontinue current opioid analgesic routine . 5 . Opioid medication continue stable nearly stable dose investigator 's opinion treatment . 6 . Subjects willing discontinue pre study laxative medication &amp; take study specific laxative medication . 7 . Subjects take daily fibre supplementation bulk agent eligible maintain stable dose &amp; regimen throughout study , &amp; investigator opinion willing &amp; able maintain adequate hydration . 8 . Subjects willing &amp; able ( e.g . mental &amp; physical condition ) participate aspect study , include use medication , completion subjective evaluation , attend schedule clinic visit , complete telephone contact , &amp; compliance protocol requirement evidence provide write , informed consent . 9 . Subjects already take nonopioid analgesic &amp; concomitant medication ( include treatment depression ) eligible take part study . However , concomitant medication consider necessary subject 's welfare continue stable dose throughout doubleblind phase study &amp; supervision investigator . 10 . Expected survival time &gt; 3 month . 11 . With capability reading , understand &amp; sign inform consent form &amp; compliance protocol requirement . Exclusion 1 . Subjects require dose &gt; 80 mg/day oxycodone PR start doubleblind phase . 2 . Any history hypersensitivity oxycodone , naloxone , morphine , bisacodyl , relate product &amp; ingredient . 3 . Subjects situation opioids contraindicate , severe respiratory depression hypoxia &amp; hypercapnia , severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , cor pulmonal , severe bronchial asthma , paralytic ileus . 4 . Subjects evidence clinically significant gastrointestinal disease ( e.g . paralytic ileus , peritoneal carcinosis ) , significant structural abnormality gastrointestinal tract ( e.g . scarring , obstruction etc ) either relate related underlying cancer disease progression . 5 . Evidence clinically significant cardiovascular , renal , hepatic psychiatric disease , determine medical history , clinical laboratory test , ECG result &amp; physical examination , would place subject risk upon exposure study medication may confound analysis &amp; interpretation study result . 6 . Abnormal aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ; SGOT ) , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ; SGPT ) , rglutamyltransferase ( GGT ) alkaline phosphatase level ( &gt; 3 time upper limit normal ) abnormal total bilirubin &amp; creatinine level ( ) ( great 1.5 time upper limit normal ) . 7 . Cyclic chemotherapy two week screen visit plan core study show past influence bowel function . If subject first cycle chemotherapy 2 week screen visit doubleblind phase study exclude study . 8 . Radiotherapy , investigator opinion , would influence bowel function pain doubleblind phase study . 9 . Subjects know suspect unstable brain metastasis spinal cord compression may require change steroid treatment throughout duration study . 10 . Subjects uncontrolled seizure . 11 . Subjects increase intracranial pressure . 12 . In investigator 's opinion , subject receive hypnotic central nervous system ( CNS ) depressant may pose risk additional CNS depression opioid study medication . 13 .
