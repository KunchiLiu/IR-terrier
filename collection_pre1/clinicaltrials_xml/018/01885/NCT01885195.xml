	<brief_title>MEK162 Patients With RAS/RAF/MEK Activated Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II , open label study determine efficacy safety treatment MEK162 patient diagnosis select solid tumor hematological malignancy pre-identified ( prior study consent ) activation RAS/RAF/MEK pathway whose disease progress standard treatment . Genomic profile become accessible patient physician . This signal-seeking study match patient mutation RAF , RAS , NF1 MEK ATP-noncompetitive MEK 1/2 inhibitor , MEK162 . Pre-identification mutation activation pathway perform locally CLIA certify laboratory prior screen participation trial . Once patient identify , treat physician qualified investigator may contact Novartis consider enrollment study . For purpose study , genomic profiling consider part screen . Informed consent must sign screening activity take place . Once eligibility ( screen criterion meet ) confirm Novartis , patient initiate therapy single agent MEK162 . The patient may receive additional anti-cancer therapy treatment MEK162 . Patients continue receive study treatment disease progression ( assessed RECIST 1.1 appropriate hematologic response criterion ) , unacceptable toxicity , death discontinuation study treatment reason ( e.g. , withdrawal consent , start new anti-neoplastic therapy discretion investigator ) , otherwise known End Treatment . All patient discontinue study treatment due disease progression must progression clearly document . Disease assessment ( per RECIST 1.1 appropriate hematological response criterion ) perform every 8 week ( ±4 day ) first dose study drug ( Day 1 every odd cycle ) , disease progression end treatment , whichever occur first . The frequency disease assessment may reduce every 12 week patient least 4 post-baseline disease assessment clinically stable ( except AML MM patient ) . Scans assess locally investigator . After discontinuation treatment , patient , regardless reason treatment discontinuation , follow safety 30 day last dose . All patient follow survival status every 3 month 2 year last patient enrol study regardless treatment discontinuation reason ( except consent withdrawn patient lose follow-up . )</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patient confirm diagnosis select solid tumor ( except primary diagnosis pancreatic cancer , biliary cancer , colorectal cancer , low grade serous ovarian cancer , melanoma ) hematologic malignancy ( except primary diagnosis chronic myelomonocytic leukemia ) .
