	<brief_summary>Objectives : In Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre ( RUNMC ) initiate study first objective investigate toxicity ( safety feasibility ) vaccination frameshift-derived neoantigen-loaded DC CRC patient MSI-positive CRC person know carrier germline MMR-gene mutation sign disease yet . The secondary objective study : - demonstrate peptide-loaded DC induce enhance immune response tumor-associated antigen CEA specific frameshift-derived neoantigens study population . - study pathological clinical response , e.g . disease-free survival , determine accord standard protocol . Study design : This study phase I/II open-label study . Study population : Two group adult vaccinate : Group I ) CRC patient , know carry germline MMR-gene mutation patient MSI-positive CRC yet unknown negative MMR-gene mutation status . Group II ) person know carrier germline MMR-gene mutation sign disease yet . All participant need HLA-A2.1 positive .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dendritic Cell Vaccination Patients With Lynch Syndrome Colorectal Cancer With MSI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale study : Ex vivo generate tumor-antigen-loaded dendritic cell ( DC ) currently use clinical vaccination protocol cancer patient . DC vaccine safe , minimal side effect . Evaluating 200 patient treat past ten year find clinical response measure several patient directly coincide specific cytotoxic T cell response . The majority study investigate therapeutic effect DC vaccine late-stage cancer patient metastasis . In ( heavily ) pretreated patient immune system compromise . Based observation specific immune response indicative good clinical outcome believe full potential immunostimulatory cell exploit high-risk patient low tumor burden precancerous state . A good clinical model carrier germline mutation one DNA mismatch repair ( MMR ) gene , patient Lynch syndrome ( also know Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer HNPCC ) . These person lifetime risk 60-80 % colorectal cancer develop within year precancerous adenoma . The immune system think potential great importance colorectal cancer Lynch syndrome characterize strong lymphocyte infiltration , even stage adenoma . In affected cancer lesion , MMR dysfunction result frameshift mutation short , repetitive DNA sequence refer microsatellites . In cod region mutation destroy gene function demonstrate lead production neopeptides . These neopeptides : 1 ) tumor specific , frameshift mutation occur tumor cell premalignant progenitor , 2 ) similar patient , since gene affect mismatch repair defect 3 ) immunogenic , since cytotoxic T cell ( CTL ) helper T cell could induce vitro blood patient Lynch syndrome . Similar mechanism occur sporadic colon cancer MMR dysfunction , represent 10-15 % colorectal 2 . Objectives : In Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre ( RUNMC ) initiate study first objective investigate toxicity ( safety feasibility ) vaccination frameshift-derived neoantigen-loaded DC CRC patient MSI-positive CRC person know carrier germline MMR-gene mutation sign disease yet . The secondary objective study demonstrate peptide-loaded DC induce enhance immune response tumor-associated antigen CEA specific frameshift-derived neoantigens study population . And want study pathological clinical response , e.g . disease-free survival , determine accord standard protocol . Study design : This study phase I/II open-label study . Study population : Two group adult vaccinate : Group I ) CRC patient , know carry germline MMR-gene mutation patient MSI-positive CRC yet unknown negative MMR-gene mutation status . Group II ) person know carrier germline MMR-gene mutation sign disease yet . All participant need HLA-A2.1 positive . Main study endpoint : The first objective study toxicity ( safety feasibility ) vaccination frameshift-derived neoantigen-loaded DC . This measure record adverse event accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events version 3.0 . The secondary objective study demonstrate peptide-loaded DC induce enhance immune response tumor-associated antigen CEA specific frameshift-derived neoantigens study population . Immune response assess : - proliferative humoral response KLH - cytokine production KLH stimulate PBMC - tumor antigen-specific T cell responses peripheral blood - tumor antigen-specific T cell response biopsy DTH - cytokine production T cell biopsy DTH - cytotoxicity T cell biopsy DTH - immunohistochemical characterization DTH infiltrating lymphocytes The pathological clinical response , e.g . disease-free survival , determine accord standard protocol .</detailed_description>
