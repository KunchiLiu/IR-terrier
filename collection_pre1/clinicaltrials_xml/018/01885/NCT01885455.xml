	<detailed_description>The burden participant minimize enhance retention . Patients usual care arm receive current `` gold standard '' treatment . The patient intervention arm assign PN , help reduce barrier care could negatively impact patient ' receipt LDTCI . The telephone-administered survey administer study participant baseline 3- , 6- , 12-months post-enrollment . It take approximately 30-40 minute administer . The telephone mode survey administration choose reduce number visit would require patient . Interviews schedule convenience study participant . To reduce burden study participant , interviewer offer break interview process . Patients arm undergo standard therapy visit . Patients navigation arm receive standard therapy visit plus navigation intervention . Outside standard therapy visit , additional clinic visit require study participant . Once informed consent obtain informed consent document receive , SSC/PN communicate MUSC HCC study staff participant 's contact information participant ready baseline survey administration . All study survey administer trained MUSC HCC study staff via telephone . A survey answer guide provide participant either in-person via mail prior administration baseline survey .</detailed_description>
