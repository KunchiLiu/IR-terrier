	<brief_summary>This phase II comparative randomize clinical trial . Eligible patient randomize ( 1:1 ) : Arm A : Myocet plus Cyclofosfamide plus Metformin Arm B : Myocet plus Cyclofosfamide Statistical Considerations : In randomized phase II study , sample size calculate base primary end-point ( PFS ) assume error α = 10 % ( 2-tailed ) power 80 % . To find advantage 4 month median time progression ( 6 month control arm B 10 month experimental arm A ) recruit 112 patient ( 98 event ) period 24 month consider 12-month follow-up . The primary analysis study conduct accordance `` intention treat '' principle , secondary analysis conduct `` per protocol '' population .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>MULTICENTER , RANDOMIZED , COMPARATIVE STUDY OF MYOCET PLUS CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE PLUS METFORMIN VERSUS MYOCET PLUS CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE IN FIRST LINE TREATMENT OF HER2 NEGATIVE METASTATIC BREAST CANCER PATIENTS . The aim study determine addition metformin regime Myocet / Cyclophosphamide improve disease-free survival patient HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer . The primary objective evaluation clinical efficacy combination Myocet / Cyclophosphamide plus Metformin compare treatment Myocet / Cyclophosphamide , term progression-free survival ( PFS ) . Clinical secondary objective : - Objective response rate - Overall survival - Tolerability - Progression-free survival , objective response rate overall survival accord Homa Index level . Secondary biological endpoint characterization metabolic profile patient ( sensitivity insulin level ) . Treatment Arm A ( experimental treatment ) : Metformin 1000 mg , 2 time daily per os* . Myocet 60 mg/m2 , intravenous infusion , day 1 , every 21 day Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 , intravenous infusion , day 1 every 21 day . * During cycle 1 , patient assume metformin day 1 day 13 begin chemotherapy day 14 . From day 1 day 3 , patient assume Metformin 1000 mg day . Starting day 4 patient assume Metformin 1000 mg 2 time day . Arm B ( standard treatment ) : Myocet 60 mg/m2 , intravenous infusion , day 1 , every 21 day Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 , intravenous infusion , day 1 , every 21 day Chemotherapy perform 8 cycle . The treatment continue progression disease . Statistical Considerations : In randomized phase II study , sample size calculate base primary end-point ( PFS ) assume error α = 10 % ( 2-tailed ) power 80 % . To find advantage 4 month median time progression ( 6 month control arm B 10 month experimental arm A ) recruit 112 patient ( 98 event ) period 24 month consider 12-month follow-up . The primary analysis study conduct accordance `` intention treat '' principle , secondary analysis conduct `` per protocol '' population .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must histologically cytologically confirm breast cancer 2 . Metastatic disease 3 . HER2 negative disease , measure IHC FISH 4 . Non endocrine responsive disease ( negative hormonal status failure endocrine therapy MBC ) 5 . Patients measurable and/or nonmeasurable disease accord RECIST Criteria ( Version 1.1 ) 6 . Homa Index calculate accord Matthews ' formula 7 . Prior endocrine therapy allow , adjuvant and/or metastatic set 8 . Prior chemotherapy allow , adjuvant setting , provide terminate least 12 month study entry . Adjuvant anthracyclines allow prior cumulative dose exceed 360 mg/m2 case epirubicin 280 mg/m2 case doxorubicin . Adjuvant taxanes allow . 9 . Age 1875 year 10 . Life expectancy great 3 month 11 . ECOG performance status &lt; 2 12 . Patients must normal organ marrow function : leukocyte &gt; =3,000/μL absolute neutrophil count &gt; =1,500/μL platelet &gt; =100,000/μL total bilirubin within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; =1.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine within normal institutional limit 13 . Adequate cardiac function , i.e . leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &gt; = 50 % 14 . The effect liposomal doxorubicin develop human fetus recommend therapeutic dose unknown . For reason anthracyclines well therapeutic agent use trial know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . All woman childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 72 hour prior start study medication . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . 15 . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document 1 . Known diabetes ( type 1 2 ) 2 . Currently metformin , sulfonylurea , thiazolidenediones insulin reason ( drug alter insulin level ) 3 . Current previous congestive heart failure , renal failure liver failure ; history acidosis type ; habitual intake 3 alcoholic beverage per day 4 . Creatinine upper limit normal institution , AST 1.5 time upper limit normal institution ( reduce risk lactic acidosis ) 5 . Hypersensitivity allergy metformin 6 . Participation another clinical trial investigational agent within 30 day prior study screen 7 . Patients know brain metastasis exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event 8 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition Myocet agent use study 9 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .</criteria>
