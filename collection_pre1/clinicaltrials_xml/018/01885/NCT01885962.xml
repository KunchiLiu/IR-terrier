	<brief_summary>The investigator propose test feasibility iSHIFTup ( Internet Skin Health Intervention For Targeted Ulcer Prevention ) adults spinal cord injury ( SCI ) prevent serious pressure ulcer ( PrUs ) promote protective health behavior . This protocol Phase 2 three phase project . In Phase 1 , investigator develop iSHIFTup . In Phase 2 , investigator test intervention partnering Woodrow Wilson Rehabilitation Center ( WWRC ) conduct randomize control trial ( RCT ) 18 participant . In Phase 3 , investigator focus optimize intervention base outcome finding feedback , sustain program WWRC , seek future funding large RCT . The investigator conduct RCT 18 participant ( 9 participant treatment usual ( TAU ) group , 9 participant TAU + iSHIFTup intervention group ) ( 18 participant need obtain statistically significant result ) . The investigator meet potential participant in-person complete inform consent process confirm eligibility . Participants TAU+iSHIFTup group use program study period . Participants randomize TAU usual treatment study period opportunity use program follow trial participation . The investigator collect information participant two time study , enrollment post-intervention 6-weeks ( 42 day ) . The investigator also collect qualitative information participant TAU+iSHIFTup group , optional focus-group setting , learn user ' experience program . The investigator expect participant TAU+iSHIFTup group compare TAU group , display great awareness personal risk pressure ulcer ; increase preventive behavior ; increase skin care self-efficacy knowledge .</brief_summary>
