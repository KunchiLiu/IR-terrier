	<brief_title>N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) Improving Cognitive Dysfunction Schizophrenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia serious mental illness associate substantial social occupational dysfunction . While positive psychotic symptom schizophrenia often respond antipsychotic medication , negative symptom cognitive impairment difficult treat , necessitate novel intervention . Cognitive deficit important treatment target degree cognitive impairment critical predictor work , education , social functioning . Glutamatergic receptor among promising biological target cognitive-enhancing drug schizophrenia . Abnormal glutamatergic signal long think important pathophysiology schizophrenia ; specifically , reduce NMDA glutamatergic receptor activity thalamic inhibitory neuron disinhibits glutamatergic neuron project cortex , cause secondary dopaminergic abnormality lead characteristic symptom , include cognitive deficit . Many electrophysiological ( EEG ) biomarkers related cognitive dysfunction schizophrenia think link deficient NMDA glutamatergic neurotransmission . Additionally , neuroplasticity think involve glutamatergic signal . This pattern linkages suggest correct impaired NMDA glutamatergic transmission schizophrenia could lead enhanced cognitive function learning . In pilot study , focus promise dietary supplement approach address glutamatergic deficit , evaluate effect EEG biomarkers performance-based neurocognitive assessment . N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) modify amino acid commonly use dietary supplement antioxidant property . NAC modulate glutamatergic signal follow : In CNS , glial cell take NAC via cystine-glutamate antiporters , turn lead increase glutamate efflux extracellular space . Extracellular glutamate bind non-synaptic glutamate receptor metabotropic glutamate receptor ( mGluR ) type 2/3 type 5 . The net result event normalization pathologically elevate cortical glutamate level . We assess EEG biomarkers associate cognitive deficit schizophrenia , include recently-described biomarker visual cortical plasticity . We also perform comprehensive assessment neurocognition MATRICS battery , could suggest whether certain cognitive domain sensitive improvement NAC therapy . Our primary aim determine whether NAC administration improve NMDA-dependent EEG abnormalities schizophrenia . We 3 hypothesis : ( 1 ) NAC administration increase mismatch negativity amplitude compare placebo ; ( 2 ) NAC administration increase P300 amplitude compare placebo ; ( 3 ) NAC administration increase gamma oscillation power phase synchronization compare placebo . We also examine whether NAC improve measure visual neuroplasticity , performance-based measure neurocognition , clinical symptom schizophrenia .</detailed_description>
