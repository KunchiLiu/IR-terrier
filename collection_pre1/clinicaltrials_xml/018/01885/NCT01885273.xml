	<brief_summary>The study examine effectiveness cleanse wound pressurize irrigation method compare conventional practice swab wound heal infection acute chronic wound , evaluate patient 's physical symptom relate wound , patient 's satisfaction cleansing method , cost material use two group . Patients acute chronic non-sutured wound well eligible exclusion criterion recruit randomly assign cleanse use either : pressurized irrigation method ( experimental group ) swab method ( control group ) . 244 patient recruit study . This take place four community health centre run Hospital Authority Hong Kong . The wound participant cleanse use assign method six week period . The clinic staff nurse responsible ongoing assessment wound . Wound assessment undertaken enrolment upon heal wound end six-week period wound heal . Demographic data information relate wound -wound size +/- wound volume , wound culture swab , symptom -wound discomfort , pain odour collect enrolment . Information relate wound subjective measure patient satisfaction -feeling cleanliness , like , staff satisfaction -feeling user-friendliness , accessibility , cleanliness , like cleanse method use VAS assessed completion treatment . A list cost measurement wound cleanse would also capture .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>- Registration/ randomization procedure : Once patient identify potential participant outpatient clinic visit , research nurse initiate enrolment process explain objective propose study patient . Informed consent obtain eligible subject . A thorough assessment measurement wound do another research nurse . Participants ask complete first questionnaire . Participants randomize either intervention control group . Randomization do randomization list generate statistician use simple randomization method program designate computer . - Schema intervention delivery data collection : The wound participant control group study group cleanse follow allocate method wound completely heal six week wound yet heal . Wound-care specialist microbiologist consult throughout study technical advice , particularly information readily available literature . Decisions relate time period need detect wound infection healing , well investigation require detect wound infection , make consultation group . The first research nurse undertake wound cleanse experimental group . Wound cleanse control group do usual staff nurse four designated clinic , attend education programme explain detail study , procedure follow , patient documentation . The first research nurse clinic nurse undertakes dress change responsible ongoing assessment wound cleanse record information volume solution amount cleanse material use , frequency dress change type dress apply visit . Participants instructed report sign infection first research nurse clinic nurse physician . The second research nurse blind wound cleanse method undertake data collection wound assessment subject enrollment upon heal wound end six-week period wound yet heal . Wounds healed end six-week period reassess data relate wound characteristic record . - Criteria study discontinuation : Participants may discontinue study assessment time . Criteria premature withdrawal trial include 1 ) Voluntary discontinuation participant without prejudice care ; 2 ) Participants lose follow . For withdrawal trial treatment : 1 ) Any surgical intervention wound require ; 2 ) Safety reason judge investigator ; 3 ) Severe non compliance protocol judge investigator , patient follow trial completion . Investigators document reason withdrawal patient note . The decision withdrawal would affect wound care management . - Statistical analysis : The time wound-healing analyzed use Cox regression analysis . An intent-to-treat principle apply analysis . Patients ' time-to-wound-healing censor time consent withdrawal , dead lose follow . The difference two arm assess use Cox model . Repeated measure ANOVA perform compare effect intervention ( vs. control ) time ( 6 week post randomization ) mean wound size change . The difference wind symptoms patient 's satisfaction comfort cleanse method analyze use Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test . Chi-square test use test difference infection incidence proportion wound completely heal follow two group . Prognostic factor assess adjust use Cox proportional hazard regression model . These variable : age , body mass index ( calculated participant ' height weight ) , wound characteristic ( location , type , wound size ) , wound status ( assess Wound Status Assessment score ) , smoke , presence underlying disease , concomitant medication mental status ( assess AMT ) . - Recruitment schedule : For purpose easy operation avoid many patient accumulated time , recruitment do separately 10 cycle . The first research nurse need perform wound dress experimental group 2 patient per hour , thus 12-13 patient day . It stop soon 26 patient recruit first week cycle facilitate spread attending time patient come 6-week wound cleanse visit , therefore need wait long . That mean take 2 month accomplish recruitment plus 6 week wound cleanse data collection 24-26 subject , therefore 20 month require 244 subject . It envisage study take 24 month .</detailed_description>
