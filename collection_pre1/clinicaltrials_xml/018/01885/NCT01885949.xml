	<brief_summary>This research study Phase II clinical trial , test safety effectiveness investigational combination drug learn whether work treat specific cancer . `` Investigational '' mean combination drug still study research doctor try find , safest dose use side effect may cause . It also mean FDA yet approve combination . The two drug test study tivozanib enzalutamide . Enzalutamide approve FDA treatment prostate cancer . On hand , tivozanib still investigational , tested combination enzalutamide . Enzalutamide androgen receptor antagonist ( block activity male sex hormone ) . Prostate cancer initially dependent male hormone testosterone growth . Hormonal therapy lower testosterone block ability testosterone act level prostate cancer currently among effective treatment prostate cancer taht spread body organ ( metastasize ) . The effectiveness hormonal treatment , however , permanent , time many prostate cancer progress spite treatment . Enzalutamide drug proven help delay progression advanced prostate cancer average 8 month . Tivozanib anti-angiogenesis medicine fight different type cancer block blood supply tumor , tumor receive nutrient need grow . The main goal study determine whether combination tivozanib enzalutamide effective delay progression disease enzalutamide give alone . This study also determine whether treatment combination tivozanib enzalutamide side effect treatment enzalutamide alone .</brief_summary>
