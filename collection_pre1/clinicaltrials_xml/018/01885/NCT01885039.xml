	<brief_summary>Background : - The Chinese University Hong Kong National Cancer Institute conduct breast tissue study connection another study breast health . This large study look breast health woman live Hong Kong . Women breast health study provide breast tissue sample biopsy surgery . Researchers want use part sample study change breast tissue relate breast disease . This sample study part large study . Objectives : - To look change breast tissue relate breast disease . Eligibility : - Women participate Hong Kong breast health study . - Participants must biopsy remove breast tissue study . Design : - Participants biopsy remove breast tissue sample . Most sample use diagnosis . A portion leftover tissue use study . - No extra surgery require . - Treatment provide part study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : Breast cancer incidence increase rapidly among many Asian population primarily due adaptation Westernized lifestyle . However , Asian woman seem distinctive profile breast cancer differs see Western population , early age onset , advanced stage , high frequency ER-negative tumor . The disproportionally high rate among young woman also see among U.S.-born Asian woman , Chinese , Filipina , Indian , Pakistani woman . These finding suggest Asian breast cancer may distinct etiology fully explain adapt westernized lifestyle . Recent molecular study suggest breast cancer comprise several biologically clinically distinct tumor subtypes . Epidemiologic evidence suggest association breast cancer risk factor may vary tumor subtype . However , previous study conduct Western population ; large , population-based epidemiologic study characterize molecular subtypes breast cancer Asian woman limit . In study , would like characterize molecular profile breast cancer among Chinese woman Hong Kong associate molecular feature clinical etiologic factor . An improved understanding inter-relationships among age , breast cancer subtypes , race/ethnicity critical development target prevention best efficacious therapy . Objectives : To assess technical feasibility 1 ) collect fresh frozen tissue fix tissue block breast cancer case Hong Kong , 2 ) conduct tumor profiling analysis collect tissue . Eligibility : Breast cancer case participant ongoing breast cancer case control study among Hong Kong woman ( Night shift breast cancer : case-control study among Hong Kong woman , lead Dr. Tse Chinese University Hong Kong ) receive surgery North District Hospital , HK , 2013 . Design : In feasibility study , plan collect fresh frozen fix tissue ( tumor adjacent normal ) approximately 100 breast cancer case give consent participate breast tissue collection pilot study . DNA RNA extract frozen tumor assess quality yield . We conduct expression profile analysis subset case ( N approximately 10 ) determine quality RNA molecular profiling analysis . We also determine whether enough epithelial benign tumor tissue construction tissue microarrays ( TMAs ) . The result feasibility study inform decision whether pursue large scale study .</detailed_description>
