	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well clofarabine melphalan donor stem cell transplant work treat patient decrease disappearance sign symptom myelodysplasia acute leukemia ( disease remission ) , chronic myelomonocytic leukemia . Giving chemotherapy , clofarabine melphalan , donor stem cell transplant help stop growth cancer cell . It may also stop patient 's immune system reject donor 's stem cell . When healthy stem cell donor infused patient may help patient 's bone marrow make stem cell , red blood cell , white blood cell , platelet . Giving clofarabine melphalan transplant may help prevent cancer come back transplant , may cause few side effect standard treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clofarabine Melphalan Before Donor Stem Cell Transplant Treating Patients With Myelodysplasia , Acute Leukemia Remission , Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Following patient safety lead-in , determine anti-tumor activity clofarabine give combination high-dose melphalan assess 2-year progression-free survival ( PFS ) . II . Estimate overall survival ( OS ) , cumulative incidence ( CI ) relapse/progression non-relapse mortality ( NRM ) 100 day , 1 year 2 year . III . Summarize toxicities/complications organ severity , include acute chronic graft-vs-host disease ( GVHD ) , infection . OUTLINE : CONDITIONING REGIMEN : Patients receive clofarabine intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour day -9 -5 melphalan IV 20 minute day -4 . TRANSPLANT : Patients undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant day 0 . GVHD PROPHYLAXIS : Beginning day -3 , patient receive tacrolimus IV orally ( PO ) sirolimus PO daily taper per City Hope standard operating procedure . After completion study treatment , patient follow weekly 60 day , 100 , 180 day , one year , yearly 5 year .</detailed_description>
