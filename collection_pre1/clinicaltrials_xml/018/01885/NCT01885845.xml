	<detailed_description>Postpartum hemorrhage one common cause maternal mortality serious maternal morbidity , especially develop world . In India , hemorrhage major cause maternal mortality : A study Register General 1993 show 23 percent maternal death rural area cause hemorrhage ( Sibley , 2005 ) . The measurement postpartum blood loss identification postpartum hemorrhage important measure effort prevent treat postpartum hemorrhage . However , visual estimation postpartum hemorrhage often lead underestimation blood loss subsequent delay seek provision appropriate treatment . In recent year , researcher employ several different method measure blood loss hospital community-based birth setting . Although research demonstrate laboratory measure accurate visual estimation technique , study explicitly document systematic difference ( ) among different collection modality . Moreover , study correlate measured blood loss change hemoglobin level experience antepartum postpartum period . The aim study compare variation measurement blood loss obtain use two popular measurement method : Excellent BRASSS-V Drape™ modify version blood collection method develop World Health Organization ( WHO ) . We propose randomize prospective study compare measurement blood loss third stage labor two different method : modify WHO blood measurement protocol Excellent BRASSS-V Drape™ . Upon admission labor ward , study staff approach deliver woman participation study seek inform consent . Blood loss measure consenting woman vaginal delivery . Women agree participate randomize one two blood collection technique : modify version WHO blood measurement protocol Excellent BRASSS-V Drape™ . Blood loss measure immediately delivery cord clamp period least one hour active bleeding stop . The blood loss quantify study staff record study form . Women receive facility 's standard care management third stage labor , applicable , treatment PPH . Measures postpartum hemoglobin level take admission delivery twenty-four hour post-delivery randomly select sub-set study participant . Besides measurement blood loss regular measurement hemoglobin sub-sample participant , change hospital 's standard procedure labor delivery .</detailed_description>
