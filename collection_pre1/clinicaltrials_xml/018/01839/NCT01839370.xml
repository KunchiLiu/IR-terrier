	<brief_summary>In study , closed-loop Adaptive Insulin Meal Supervisor system ( AIMS ) utilize continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) , subcutaneous insulin pump standard pramlintide therapy apply individual type 1 diabetes . Pramlintide , drug well recognize help control hyperglycemia meal , evaluate closed loop open loop control . It expect closed loop control condition pramlintide improve glycemia , thus combine well control enhance safety . In recent pilot study , investigator start test concept collect data show order successful strategy must controller equipped ability optimize configuration timing meal boluses concomitant administration pramlintide . Our preliminary data review previously unavailable individual data German study indicate large individual variability time appearance meal insulin need . Thus , adequate safety efficacy meal insulin pramlintide , investigator develop new closed-loop controller account variability individual response meal meal delay , Adaptive Insulin Meal Supervisor system ( AIMS ) . In study , performance combination AIMS system standard pramlintide treatment test versus standard pramlintide treatment alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study Adaptive Insulin Meal Supervisor ( AIMS ) Adults With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study probe concept Model Predictive Control insulin delivery strategy closed-loop glucose control supervise safety system couple standard amylin replacement therapy patient type 1 diabetes result combined treatment unify benefit individual therapy . In order reduce post-meal blood glucose excursion patient type 1 diabetes mellitus , pramlintide ( analog human β-cell hormone , amylin ) utilize , thus deal problem meal hyperglycemia effectively insulin infusion alone . Pramlintide successful maintain normal blood glucose concentration significantly improve postprandial glucose excursion patient add mealtime insulin mimic closely diurnal β-cell secretory pattern see normal physiology . However , pramlintide treatment result post-prandial hypoglycemia primarily due overbolusing insulin . Closed-loop system show potential significantly reduce hypoglycemia . A combined closed-loop insulin + pramlintide therapy could provide advantage individual therapy , may also provide certain benefit respect weight control improvement sense well decrease glucose variability . A potentially important secondary benefit combine pramlintide treatment precise insulin delivery closed-loop system , base upon animal study perform research team , moderate inhibition glucagon , usually achieve pramlintide treatment , anticipate potentially improve safety insulin treatment well enhance glucagon response hypoglycemia , usually impaired type 1 diabetes , occur early postprandial period .</detailed_description>
