	<brief_summary>In severe bronchial asthma mechanism inflammation bronchospasm complex still clarify . The smooth muscle cell play important role mechanical point view , culmination neurogenic stimulus inflammatory cytokine determine final effect bronchospasm time hypertrophy muscular coat . There hypothesis smooth muscle cell may play role central regulator chemical mediator cause bronchospasm inflammation , although currently firm conclusion 2 According studies3 , nerve receptor TRANSIENT RECEPTOR POTENTIAL VANILLOID TYPE 1 great importance complex mechanism airway inflammation . ( There least 4 ) These receptor would intervene accord follow mechanism : 1 . Irritants bronchial mucosa stimulate TRANSIENT RECEPTOR POTENTIAL VANILLOID TYPE 1 present afferent ending sensory fiber , unmyelinated C ( chemiosensitive neuron ) 2 . On afferent axon act factor activation effect ( lower activation threshold , increase expression , promote translocation TRPV1 receptor membrane ) . Among factor neurotrophins important NERVE GROWTH FACTOR ( NGF ) 3 . The activation TRPV1 ( release Ca2 + + ) determine two efferent response : 1 . CENTRALLY-MEDIATED 2 . LOCAL AXON Reflex Investigators hypothesize BT may strong influence destruction nerve receptor TRPV1 unmyelinated nerve fiber locate mucosa go stop reflection central local authority responsible activation bronchospasm . In support hypothesis , anatomical studies4 , show receptor numerous level main bronchus main target BT . Please note context already know thermoablations commonly use cardiology use radio frequency development heat control 65 ° , BT , able interrupt circuit nervous responsible activation circuit cause abnormal 'arrhythmia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The mechanism action bronchial thermoplasty exerts positive action demonstrate study yet well understood yet . The action denaturation destruction smooth muscle layer bronchus intermediate high caliber perhaps fully explain action , take account smooth muscle load small airway minimally altered procedure . From premise outline section mechanism inflammation hypothesize BT may strong influence destruction nerve receptor TRPV1 unmyelinated nerve fiber locate mucosa go stop reflection central local authority responsible activation bronchospasm . In support hypothesis , anatomical studies4 , show receptor numerous level main bronchus main target BT .
