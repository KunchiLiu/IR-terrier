	<brief_summary>Emergency Departments ( EDs ) critical component U.S. healthcare system , treat 119 million patient year . While EDs historically neglect tobacco control effort , several recent study examine feasibility efficacy implement tobacco cessation ED . Work research team others , show tobacco treatment feasible effective ED setting . Effective , evidence-based intervention treat tobacco dependence also codify United States Public Health Service guideline . Even brief intervention deliver physician healthcare provider produce significant increase cessation across diverse clinical setting ( e.g. , outpatient clinic , surgery unit , EDs ) , patient group ( cardiac , respiratory , general admission ) . However , clinical practice , delivery tobacco intervention inconsistent best , particularly non-primary care setting . This translational study use exist Emergency Department Information System ( EDIS ) , facilitate identification smoker enhance provision smoke cessation intervention material pharmacological adjunct patient receive treatment ED . The EDIS track geographic chronologic progression patient ED contain triage nursing note , lab value , radiology report link image , vital sign , embed printable discharge instruction , fax link primary care provider ( PCP ) office . Following recruitment baseline ( care-as-usual ) cohort ( Step 1 ) , investigator provide train ED physician staff improve identification treatment smoker . Following Step 1 , investigator make adaptation EDIS system include smoke status tracking , tobacco treatment prompt medication information panel emergency treat physician , link printable discharge instruction , quit-smoking medication information referral pro-active phone follow-up counseling enrol smoker . A second cohort participant ( Step 2 ) enrol implementation complete . Contemporaneous Steps 1 2 , participant cohort recruit control site ( UMass Medical ) control potential effect historical trend . This study represent comprehensive systems-based translation empirically support tobacco treatment build widely use patient track platform ( MedHost ) maximize probability develop sustainable tobacco intervention readily disseminate . Specific Aims A.1 . To test incremental efficacy modify Emergency Department Information System ( EDIS ) `` MedHost '' , use multiple-cohort design implement 2 step . Two recruitment phase ( baseline/care usual full implementation ) use assess impact EDIS enhancements rate identification treatment ED patient smoke . The primary outcome difference six-month abstinence recruit prior program implementation ( Baseline ) versus recruit program fully implement ( Step 2 ) . H1 ) Smokers enrol Step 2 RIH show significantly great cessation month 6 compare Step 1 control site participant . A.2 . To compare rate smoker identification , physician intervention follow care smoke cessation use quit-smoking medication among ED patient recruit EDIS modification . H2 ) Compared Step 1 control site , Step 2 show significantly high rate smoker identification , physician intervention follow-up smoking , use quit-smoking medication . A.3 . To investigate effect EDIS enhancement relevant behavioral psychological construct may act mediator smoke behavior change ( `` Mechanisms Action '' ) , relationships potential mediator smoke cessation ( e.g. , perceive risk , nicotine dependence ; Measures section ) . H3 ) Participants enrol Step 2 RIH show great change posit mediational construct enrol Step 1 control site . A.4 . To examine incremental cost implementation intervention conduct analyse marginal cost effectiveness use cost-per-smoker-quit . ( This aim hypothesis drive ) Exploratory Aim : A.5 . To examine ED physician health care provider ( HCP ) attitudes regard utility EDIS system tobacco intervention . The investigator conduct interview ED physicians nurse elicit perception usefulness helpfulness modify EDIS , effect perceive self-efficacy motivation provide tobacco intervention . The investigator also solicit direct feedback modify platform user interface .</brief_summary>
