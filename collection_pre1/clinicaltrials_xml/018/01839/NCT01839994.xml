	<brief_title>Conformal Radiotherapy ( CRT ) Alone Versus CRT Combined With HDR BT Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prostate cancer consider disease relatively slow natural course good clinical prognosis . Such description , however , well refer intermediate high-risk case long-term rate biochemical progression remain satisfactory , available treatment modality entail considerable morbidity . Over last decade several competitive therapeutic approach evolve curative treatment intermediate high-risk prostate cancer . The use intensity-modulated radiation therapy ( IMRT ) make possible escalate total dose prostate without excessive toxicity . Based assumption low value low α/β value adenocarcinoma prostate , potential escalate biological dose tumor high dose per fraction . High-dose-rate brachytherapy ( HDR-BT ) one option , ability conform radiation dose prostate sharp dose gradient adjacent critical organ . An increase number study suggest usefulness boost intermediate high risk disease . The randomized trial conduct UK compare external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) alone EBRT HDR brachytherapy boost . Combining EBRT HDR BT - boost result significantly high relapse-free-survival ( RFS ) comparable incidence severe late toxicity . However , total dose use EBRT alone - arm radiotherapy technique may consider suboptimal accord current standard . Stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) may interest alternative HDR brachytherapy , require implantation multiple catheter anesthesia . SBRT boost advance localized prostate cancer potential reduce toxicity escalate dose . First result trial combine conventional irradiation hypofractionated stereotactic boost institutional pilot result give promising outcome . The comparison modality radiation therapy prostate cancer perform current phase III trial study .</detailed_description>
