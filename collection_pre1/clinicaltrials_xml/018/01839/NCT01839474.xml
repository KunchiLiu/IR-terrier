	<brief_title>CPAP Survival Study Ghana</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute respiratory infection , malaria , sepsis remain leading cause death child throughout world.These condition may lead respiratory distress eventually failure adequately manage . In develop country limit resource , advance airway management support challenge need approach different manner do developed nation . For example , use invasive mechanical ventilation respiratory distress option many resource-limited country due lack available technology , infrastructure , trained personnel . Other alternative utilized order support child reversible condition acute respiratory distress stage . One alternative non-invasive positive pressure . Prior research demonstrate nasal bubble CPAP successfully introduce utilized develop country 's emergency ward . Nurses four Ghanaian district hospital emergency ward ( Kintampo , Mampong , Nkoranza , Wenchi ) able safely apply CPAP monitor patient 's response . The investigator demonstrate patient receive CPAP significant decrease respiratory rate compare mean difference 14 breath per minute . There major side effect associate use CPAP . Now CPAP demonstrate decrease respiratory rate non-specific disease population present respiratory distress important determine also improve survival . Therefore , purpose study determine use CPAP child 1 month 5 year age respiratory distress decrease mortality .</detailed_description>
