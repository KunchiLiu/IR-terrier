	<brief_summary>Fibromyalgia Syndrome ( FS ) one condition affect functional performance , especially woman , due alteration entire musculoskeletal system . Given , Physical Therapy ( PT ) study human movement dysfunction , FS , complex chronic characteristic , impairs affect individual 's activity cause movement disorder , PT professional must part multidisciplinary team involve FS treatment . Nonetheless , explain present proposal , several aspect still need clarification relate PT role syndrome . Particularly , study analyze biomechanical , sensorial cardiorespiratory adaptation individual undergo PT intervention still lack ; study would contribute scientific evidence clinical practice . According recent systematic review , one use therapy positive effect FS subject hydrotherapy , combine exercise water relax effect . Other alternative treatment also search , attempt decrease painful picture present , FS etiology pathophysiology well know . The aim study evaluate efficacy different physical therapy resource FS , two subprojects . The first verify hydrotherapy effective modifying movement variable ( scapular kinematics electromyography ) autonomic modulation . Other variable , pain level quality life woman FS , also analyze . The second study evaluate efficacy Shiatsu massage pain , sleep quality , balance quality life subject FS .</brief_summary>
