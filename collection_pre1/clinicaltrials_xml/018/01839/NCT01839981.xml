	<brief_title>CPI-613 Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine initial estimate overall survival ( OS ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate . II . To determine progression free survival ( PFS ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive 6,8-bis ( benzylthio ) octanoic acid intravenously ( IV ) 2 hour day 1-5 week 1 ( pre-course 1 ) , day 1 4 week 2 3 ( course 1 ) , day 1 4 week 1-3 ( course 2-6 ) . Treatment repeat every 4 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
