	<brief_title>APBI Proton Feasibility Phase II Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose APBI Proton Therapy study examine feasibility , side effect , clinical efficacy use proton therapy tumor bed woman treat breast cancer surgical removal malignancy ( opposed whole breast treatment ) . The study 's aim establish effect type therapy compare traditional radiation whole breast treatment therapy . In order eligible , patient must female old 50 either invasive ductal , medullary , papillary , colloid ( mucinous ) tubular histology stage IA-IIA breast cancer , ECOG performance status 0-2 , margin great equal 2mm , node negative microscopic node disease , estrogen- progesterone-positive breast cancer , eligibility criterion must meet detailed describe herein .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically confirm diagnosis invasive noninvasive breast cancer . Invasive ductal , medullary , papillary , colloid ( mucinous ) tubular histology . AJCC T1 T2 ; N0 N1mic ; Stage IAIIA breast cancer AJCC TIS ( Stage 0 ) ductal carcinoma situ without invasion Gross disease must unifocal pathologic ( invasive and/or DCIS ) tumor size 3 cm less . ( Patients microscopic multifocality eligible long total pathological size 3 cm less ) . Estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive invasive breast cancer . DCIS stage 0 require receptor test . No evidence distant metastatic disease document history physical examination ( radiographic staging perform indicated symptom physical finding . ) Patients must ECOG Performance Status 0 , 1 2 Age ≥ 50 . Patients must able provide inform consent . Patients must undergo breastconserving surgery All tumor ( invasive noninvasive disease ) must excise minimum margin width ≥ 2 mm . Reexcision surgical margin permit . Focally close ( &lt; 2 mm ) positive ( tumor cell ink edge specimen ) margin determine anatomic boundary resection surgeon , posterior fascia posterior margin skin anterior margin , also acceptable . Patients invasive breast cancer must nodenegative ( N0 ) microscopic disease ( ≤2mm ) node ( N1mi ) . Patients Stage IA IIA require axillary stag do patient Stage 0 DCIS . Options axillary stag include : 1 . Negative sentinel lymph node biopsy ( SLNB ) 2 . Level III axillary lymph node dissection ( ALND ) ( 6 node remove ) . 3 . Positive SLNB follow completion ALND ( 6 node remove ) . Patients present abnormal microcalcifications screen mammogram must radiographically confirm excision suspicious microcalcifications , either specimen radiograph postbiopsy mammogram . The patient must enrol study within 50 day follow last surgery breast cancer ( lumpectomy , reexcision margin , axillary staging procedure ) . The target lumpectomy cavity must clearly delineate target lumpectomy cavity/whole breast reference volume must ≤ 30 % base postoperative/preenrollment CT scan . Patients must bilateral mammogram and/or breast MRI within 3 month diagnosis breast cancer . CBC/differential obtain within 3 month prior registration study , adequate bone marrow function define follow : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1,800 cells/mm3 ; Platelets ≥ 75,000 cells/mm3 ; Hemoglobin ≥ 8.0 g/dl ( Note : The use transfusion intervention achieve Hgb ≥ 8.0 g/dl acceptable ) . Patients synchronous bilateral breast cancer treat radiotherapy breast eligible , provide treatment perform manner avoids overlap treatment field . Both side may treat APBI pathologic eligibility criterion meet tumor , one side may treat APBI criterion meet one tumor . Patients history prior breast cancer opposite breast eligible long treatment perform without overlap prior RT field . Patients history prior breast cancer ipsilateral breast treat lumpectomy alone ( RT ) eligible long entry criterion study meet . Patients history nonbreast malignancy eligible long receive prior radiotherapy thoracic region , great 2 year interval without evidence recurrence . Women childbearing potential must nonpregnant nonlactating willing exercise effective form birth control radiation therapy ( e.g . oral contraceptive , IUD , condom barrier method etc. ) . Hysterectomy menopause must clinically document . Patient must provide studyspecific inform consent prior study entry . Exclusion Criteria Male breast cancer T2 ( &gt; 3cm ) , T3 , T4 , Node positive ( N1mi ) , M1 disease Lobular mix ductal lobular histology . Multifocal primary tumor . Clear delineation extent lumpectomy cavity possible . Prior simultaneous malignancy within past two year ( carcinoma situ cervix , CIS colon , melanoma situ , thyroid cancer , basal cell squamous cell carcinoma skin ) . Any nonaxillary sentinel node ( ) positive . ( Note intramammary node stag axillary node ) . Patients positive SLNB decline completion ALND eligible . Patients treat neoadjuvant chemotherapy eligible . Palpable radiographically suspicious ipsilateral contralateral axillary , supraclavicular , infraclavicular , internal mammary node , unless histological confirmation node negative tumor . Suspicious microcalcifications , density , palpable abnormality ( inpsilateral contralateral breast ) unless biopsied found benign . Proven multicentric carcinoma ( invasive cancer DCIS ) one quadrant two breast cancer resectable single lumpectomy incision . Paget 's disease nipple . Surgical margin microscopically assess positive pathological evaluation . A focally positive margin determine anatomic boundary resection surgeon , posterior fascia posterior margin skin anterior margin , also acceptable . If surgical margin render free disease reexcision , patient eligible . Breast implant . ( Patients implant remove eligible ) . Prior ipsilateral breast thoracic radiation condition . Collagen vascular disease , specifically dermatomyositis CPK level normal active skin rash , systemic lupus erythematosis , scleroderma . Pregnant woman , woman plan become pregnant woman nurse . Psychiatric addictive disorder condition , opinion investigator , would preclude patient meeting study requirement . Actively treated therapeutic research study .</criteria>
