	<brief_summary>This research attempt well understand alter preserved memory mechanism Alzheimer disease , particularly well apprehend learn implicit memory process , give scientific support non-pharmalogical intervention . At present time , possible delay emergence symptom related disease , eventually decrease , cure . Yet , care patient become crucial question solution propose healthy age people appropriate Alzheimer patient present specific disorder . The improvement quality life institutionalize patient lie good comprehension disorder also preserve ability . The literature testify great heterogeneity clinical expression disease , however notice two constant regard capability generally announce preserve , one hand , implicit memory , hand artistic aptitude , particularly musical capability . Patients Alzheimer disease present particularly severe early deterioration episodic memory . Thus , begin disease explicit acquisition new knowledge become increasingly difficult . However , clinical observation , new learn unknown song , even patient severe stage illness , seem support assumption preservation implicit learn ability . Indeed , several study already show preserved implicit memory capability among patient Alzheimer disease , mostly begin stage illness : preserved effect perceptual priming , procedural learning . Thus , mainly interested effect exposure rise feeling familiarity , show preserve implicit learning ability , moderate severe Alzheimer patient . However , study carry date use neuroimaging technique , among Alzheimer patient moderate severe stage illness , main objective identify cerebral substrate imply learn new knowledge . Indeed , several study already show preserved implicit memory capability among patient Alzheimer disease , mostly perform begin stage illness none study thesis learn ability moderate severe Alzheimer patient . The objective work specify , severe form Alzheimer disease , cognitive mechanism allow memorizing ( feel familiarity ) new information thus highlight neural network underlie learn process ( recently learn stimulus v old stimulus ) . The goal propose positive image Alzheimer patient , understand cognitive mechanism cerebral area allow learn capability . 20 patient Alzheimer moderate severe stage , 20 patient mild moderate stage illness , 20 healthy age participant , select neurological interview neuropsychological evaluation . The whole include participant take part experimental protocol organize two phase : - phase familiarization phase test . The phase familiarization consist repeat exposure ( daily session MRI acquisition ) new song new paint obtain high feeling familiarity item . The phase test carry 3T MRI camera , comprise anatomical ( T1 , T2 MRI ) functional acquisition . The functional acquisition corresponds passive listen see task musical pictorial stimulus . Finally , participant realize debrief phase allow obtain feedback familiarity stimulus present functional acquisition .</brief_summary>
