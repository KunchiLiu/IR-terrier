	<brief_summary>The study aim test whether use promotoras significantly impact health attitude , health seek behavior , patient confidence self-managing health rural Hispanic adult diagnose metabolic syndrome . Specifically , study design address four area inquiry : 1 ) identification patient attitude involve : ) trust medical provider health care system , b ) procedural fairness treatment , c ) provider patient communication pattern , ) potential cultural bias treatment , e ) healthy lifestyle behavior adoption/maintenance , 2 ) select clinical indicator metabolic syndrome ( blood pressure , height/weight/BMI , blood glucose , hemoglobin A1c , cholesterol ) , 3 ) cultural competence medical provider perspective provider patient , 4 ) patient self-management confidence score .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Utilizing Promotora Model Rural Adult Hispanics Diagnosed With Metabolic Syndrome : A Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The following research question investigate study : 1 . For adult rural Hispanic patient diagnose metabolic syndrome , add service promotora standard care model significantly change metric associate metabolic syndrome great extent standard care model ? 2 . For adult rural Hispanic patient diagnose metabolic syndrome , add service promotora standard care model significantly change attitude trust medical provider health care system great extent standard care model ? 3 . For adult rural Hispanic patient diagnose metabolic syndrome , add service promotora standard care model significantly change attitude associate comfort seek care health care system great extent standard care model ? 4 . For adult rural Hispanic patient diagnose metabolic syndrome , add service promotora standard care model significantly change perception cultural bias regard treatment compare patient use standard care model ? 5 . For adult rural Hispanic patient diagnose metabolic syndrome , add service promotora standard care model significantly change attitude associated feeling procedural fairness health care treatment great extent standard care model ? 6 . For adult rural Hispanic patient diagnose metabolic syndrome , add service promotora standard care model significantly change Patient Activation Measure ( PAM ) score time compare patient utilize standard care model ? 7 . For adult rural Hispanic patient diagnose metabolic syndrome , add service promotora standard care model significantly change doctor-patient communication score time compare patient utilize standard care model ? 8 . For rural Hispanic patient diagnose metabolic syndrome , add service promotora standard care model significantly change perception cultural competence provider compare patient experience standard care model ? The propose study utilize randomize clinical trial design ass efficacy combine community health worker/ promotora service plus standard clinical care versus standard clinical care model rural Hispanic patient diagnose metabolic syndrome . This design select : 1 ) best protect possible confounding , 2 ) ethical issue study participant receive minimum current standard care metabolic syndrome , 3 ) three year enough time assess result , 4 ) sufficient staff available . In order answer research question pose earlier , primary data must collect since design analyze secondary data sufficient instance . Patients identify three primary care clinic Southern Idaho receive care . The clinic locate Caldwell , Nampa , Jerome , Idaho . Caldwell population 47,000 ( 50.6 % female ) 35 % Hispanic 26 % speak Spanish primary language . Nampa population 81,000 ( 51 % female ) 23 % Hispanic 17 % home English primary language . Jerome population 11,000 ( 49.5 % female ) 34 % Hispanic approximately 24 % home Spanish primary language spoken.32 The Family Medicine Residency Idaho ( FMRI ) two Rural Training Track ( RTT ) program participate , one Caldwell one Jerome ( 130 mile east Caldwell ) . A third site clinic ( 35 % patient Hispanic ) rural Nampa , community locate 15 mile outside Boise . Each rural clinic see 1,000 ( Nampa Jerome ) 1,800 ( Caldwell ) unduplicated adult Hispanic patient per year , estimate 10-20 % metabolic syndrome extreme risk develop condition . After review medical record , patient identify metabolic syndrome sent letter invite participation study . Patients outside clinic also eligible participate notify opportunity community advertise Spanish language radio church , restaurant , grocery store frequent member Hispanic community . A patient recruitment coordinator employ purpose , he/she continue recruit number patient need reach adequate sample size agree participate reach . No one patient per family allow participate study . The Caldwell Clinic seek 128 patient intervention control group ( four cohort 32 intervention control group ) . Each two clinic goal 60 patient group ( three cohort 20 intervention control group ) . The cumulative number 248 per group ( sum total enrollment clinic ) allow 10-12 % attrition rate throughout study timeframe still retain statistical power detect difference might exist group . If 10 % attrition occur , group would still `` n '' 225 value use determine statistical power analysis subsection plan . A chart appendices illustrate study site , cohort size , date data collection . Although discussed detail Section Four , patient meet inclusion criterion consent participate include study . All participant study adult rural residing patient Hispanic ethnicity diagnose metabolic syndrome . Patients clinic randomize control group ( total three clinic n = 248 ) intervention group ( total three clinic n = 248 ) intervention group receive education promotora addition standard treatment control group receive standard treatment protocol . All patient receive annual physical exam appropriate lab test ( lab test every six month ) regular MD follow . At time introduction study six month interval period one year , participant complete patient activation measure ( PAM ) qualitative attitude measure describe detail late section . Initiation study stagger Caldwell clinic start January 2014 two clinic start April 2015 . Again , please see appendix detail study plan chart complete timeline . The use multiple clinic help minimize ( least allows control ) potential influence clinic environment provider effect enable good control possible cohort history effect . Using Caldwell clinic example , two promotoras work 16 patient three month period . During timeframe , conduct four home education visit patient four group session entire 16 member cohort . At conclusion first three month , new 16 patient cohort/promotora start new intervention patient . This three month intense contact sequence Caldwell patient repeat four cycle 128 intervention patient experience promotora exposure . Following three month intense promotora exposure intervention patient experience monthly large group session promotora total nine month complete qualitative questionnaire laboratory test six month interval one year start date arrives . After patient 's one year anniversary beginning study protocol , study end person . Each intervention cohort accompany control group patient equal number . The one year timeframe clinic help reduce chance elevate drop-out rate . This pattern repeat year two Nampa clinic Jerome clinic one promotora 20 intervention patient cohort begin April 1 , 2015 . Because clinic small Caldwell , three cycle ( instead four ) three month intense promotora exposure ( 4 individual 4 group session ) hold few patient recruit . Of course , 20 person cohort mirror 20 patient control group . Again intense promotora exposure , intervention patient experience monthly large group session promotora complete qualitative questionnaire laboratory test six month interval one year start date arrives . For clinic , patient assign control group entrance physical screening complete qualitative questionnaire PAM instrument laboratory test start study , six month interval , exit physical exam one year enrol study . Promotoras recruit community significant input member Hispanic Community Advisory Board ( CAB ) actively involve Companeros en Salud ( CES ) Partners Health ( PIH ) program Idaho Partnership Hispanic Health past five year . The promotora training model study adapt establish curriculum project . Standard templates recruitment training develop Linda Powell , Principal Investigator Companeros en Salud project . Co-PI Lynda Bennett Mountain States Group direct recruitment , train ongoing support/oversight promotoras ensure consistency delivery intervention training across three community , well timeliness fidelity topic discuss group member family .</detailed_description>
