	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose quinacrine dihydrochloride give together erlotinib hydrochloride see well work treat patient stage IIIB-IV non-small cell lung cancer . Erlotinib hydrochloride may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , quinacrine dihydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide .

	<brief_title>Erlotinib Hydrochloride Quinacrine Dihydrochloride Stage IIIB-IV Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess safety tolerability combination erlotinib ( erlotinib hydrochloride ) quinacrine ( quinacrine dihydrochloride ) patient advance non-small-cell lung cancer . II . To determine recommended Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) combination erlotinib quinacrine patient advance non-small-cell lung cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To describe dose limit toxicity erlotinib quinacrine combination . II . To determine pharmacokinetic profile erlotinib quinacrine combination . III . To determine objective response rate ( complete response [ CR ] +partial response [ PR ] ) clinical benefit rate ( CR+PR+ stable disease [ SD ] ) erlotinib quinacrine combination . IV . To estimate overall survival ( OS ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose escalation study quinacrine dihydrochloride Escalation Portion : Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily day 1-28 quinacrine dihydrochloride PO thrice daily ( TID ) day , 1-7 PO daily day 8-28 . After Maximum Tolerated Dose establish : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride PO daily day 1-28 . ARM II : Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride PO quinacrine dihydrochloride PO daily ( TID ) day , 1-7 PO daily day 8-28 . In arm , course repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
