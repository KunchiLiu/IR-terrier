	<brief_title>The Effect Preoperative Suggestions Perioperative Dreams Dream Recalls</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator carry 2009 2011 Department Oral Maxillofacial Surgery Faculty Dentistry , University Debrecen , prospective randomize fashion . Adult patient include , verbal communication possible . After write informed consent , write agreement obtain . Exclusion criterion : mental retardation , tracheotomy , inability communicate . None participant need exclude . Among others , important component general anaesthesia provide sufficient level hypnosis procedure , well reduce anxiety perioperative period . Perioperatively used hypnosis suggestive technique employ , addition local , general anaesthesia complementer technique anxiolysis , sedation , relaxation , pain alleviation , amnesia . It proven despite use depth anesthesia monitor : recent decade occurrance perioperative dream avoid . 7-16 According present knowledge , dream formation anaesthetic procedure reflect brief period light level hypnosis dream show close relationship external event perioperative period . Unpleasant perioperative dream dream recall may lead decreased patient satisfaction relate surgical/anaesthesiological event thus reduce . It seem imagination guide suggestion anaesthesia induction modify dream recall recovery . The main goal suggestive technique perioperative phase turn content dream toward favourable direction consider pleasant event patient . So far little attention pay administration perioperative psychological method may meet requirement . Along line , present study intend assess whether dream recall influence two different psychological method administer preoperative setting . The investigator intend answer follow study question : 1 . What incidence spontaneous dream recallable dream use different general anaesthesiological method ? 2 . What effect perioperative suggestion dreamfilm-formation training occurrence dream recallable dream different general anaesthesiological technique ? 3 . What influence induction maintance anaesthesia agent psychological method ? 4 . Finally investigator intend assess whether relationship find content preoperatively administer suggestion prepared dreamfilms well postoperatively recalled dream . Grouping patient Patients randomly allocate three group accord follow aspect : 1 . In control group spontaneous dream patient assess conventionally manage anaesthesia without suggestion . 2 . In suggestion group patient receive suggestion evoke image exclusively operate theatre time narcosis induction . For , patient instruct find fix favourite place `` want travel '' anaesthesia . 3 . In `` dreamfilm group '' patient work dreamfilm-plan use favourite place technique one day prior surgery . At induction narcosis , series image prepare suggestion evoke . In three previously list group 3 subgroup form base anaesthesiological technique use : Subgroup 1 : anesthetic induction etomidate ( 0,15-0,3 mg/kg ) , maintenance sevoflurane ( 1 MAC ( minimal alveolar concentration ) , low-flow technique ) , Subgroup 2 : anesthetic induction propofol ( 1,5-2,5 mg/kg ) , maintenance sevoflurane ( 1 MAC , low-flow tchnique ) , Subgroup 3 ( TIVA group ) : anesthetic induction propofol ( 1,5-2,5 mg/kg ) , maintenance propofol ( 8-10 mg/kg/hour ) . Psychological method use The `` favourite place '' technique '' describes guide imagination life event help positive suggestion immediately induction anesthesia . In operating theatre first measurement make patient inform go happen , sensation induction agent would cause also told waking stimulus would name . We ask patient pay attention noise , anaesthetist say . The suggestion technique start relaxation exercise , use suggestion promote calm , deep breathing muscle relaxation . In pleasantly relax atmosphere positive suggestion help patient imagine favourite place activity feel calm , safe happy . Acting suggestion , gesture , action , touch voice unwittingly evoke effect patient . Suggestions help u guide vivid imagination patient alter state consciousness . The patient simply ask remember event , aim produce feel `` virtually '' favourite place . Meanwhile patient involved imagination process dialogue form . `` Dreamfilm method '' : Patients meet one day prior surgery ask imagine produce film would like `` watch '' anaesthesia . Thus , `` favourite place '' produce patient , feature prepared dreamfilm evoke suggestion time induction narcosis . In group , favourite place dreamfilm produce patient record prior anaesthesia physician sake analysis . All suggestion anesthesias perform person ( JGY ) , certify experienced anaesthetist psychotherapist . Postanaesthetic management OR : After patient awaken , call name , informed operation finish . Thereafter receive amnesia-lifting suggestion , ask , recovery full consciousness , retain dream recall later ward could report independent assistant . At phase , event related recovery period record , include patient 's first reaction early recovery phase . Gathering data The patient interview dream postoperative questionnaire fill department 's assistant , 10 60 minute recovery , respectively . These pretrained , independent ( blind ) staff personnel aware group status patient . The postoperative questionnaire contain parameter patient ' general condition : blood pressure , pulse , complication , communication . A pivotal part questionnaire question dream report . One section questionnaire concern assessment relationship anaesthetist patient ( rapport ) well team 's work patient 's anxiety level related procedure . ( See Appendix ) On day study , first author record data questionnaire ( preoperative blinded-postoperative ) , assessment rapport anaesthetist ( 5 : best mark , 1 : bad mark ) description association serve `` favourite place '' . Anaesthetic monitoring technique General anaesthesia well suggestion technique patient group 2 3 apply single physician ( JGy ) . Midazolam ( 7,5- 15 mg ) atropin ( 0,5-1 mg ) administer per o one hour anaesthetic induction premedication patient . Induction maintenance anaesthesia perform depend group status patient , describe . In three anaesthetic protocol , pain relief achieve fentanyl ( 0,02-0,05 mg/kg bolus ) , muscle relaxation atracurium ( 0,5 mg/kg bolus , 0 , 15mg/kg rep. ) , mivacurium ( 0,2 mg/kg ) , depend length surgery . Intratracheal intubation perform case , follow pressure control ventilation technique , use oxygen-air mixture , Dräger Primus anaesthetic device . Monitoring secure use Dräger Infinity Kappa XLT monitor : part standard narcosis monitoring , non-invasive blood pressure , pulse oxymetry , capnography , ECG , relaxometry perform . Hypnotic depth measure use bispectral index monitor ( BIS ) . Anaesthesia manage ensure hypnotic depth measure BIS 40 60 throughout entire time elapse intubation wound closure . Monitoring start time point induction anaesthesia end total recovery patient , awake state consciousness return adequate communication reach . Postoperative analgesia : Tramadol ( 4x 1mg/kg ) metamizole ( 4x0,5-1 g ) use reduce postoperative pain necessary proper pain relief . Analgesia anxiolysis measurement : The efficiency analgesia grade every hour patient base rating scale use Hungarian school assessment ( 5 best grade= pain , 4= mild pain , 3= moderate pain , 2= strong pain , 1= bad , intolerable pain ) . Statistical method The statistical analysis perform SPSS 11.5 software . We use follow procedure test : - χ²-test independence two variable , provide SPSS Crosstabs procedure . As well know , interpret even test homogeneity distribution , purpose use . - T-test independent sample ( use large sample version independent sample binomial test , however , SPSS offer , use t-test instead , test asymptotically equivalent ) . - One-sample binomial test . Dependent variable examine Patient report 10 60 minute respectively recovery appearance dream ( yes/no ) .</detailed_description>
