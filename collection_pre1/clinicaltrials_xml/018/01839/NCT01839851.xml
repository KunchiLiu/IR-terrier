	<brief_summary>The purpose study prospectively examine relation topical corticosteroid use hair cortisol concentration , among patient moderate persistent asthma allergic rhinitis . The investigator hypothesize patient asthma allergic rhinitis treat topical corticosteroid ( i.e . inhaled corticosteroid ( ICS ) intranasal glucocorticoid ( INGC ) ) high level hair cortisol 3 month treatment 3 month prior initiation treatment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inhaled corticosteroid proven effective treatment asthma , suppress airway inflammation reduce bronchial hyper-responsiveness . Beneficial clinical outcome include few asthmatic symptom , increase lung function , improve asthma-specific quality life , few asthmatic exacerbation , include severe attack result hospitalization death . ICS commonly use asthmatic episode frequent severe control solely short act beta agonist . ICS adverse effect low medium dos , mainly local effect hoarseness oral thrush . On hand , high dos ICS associate systemic effect increase risk skin bruising , cataract , elevate intraocular pressure accelerate loss bone mass . While less evidence point towards systemic effect low medium dose ICS , several study suggest effect exists . One study demonstrate change hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis ICS administration dose low 88 Î¼g fluticasone per day . Moreover , study child show ICS influence basal cortisol level significantly reduce peak cortisol adrenocorticotropic hormone level . Hence , extent systemic effect ICS high dos especially low medium dose fully understood . This partly due nature systemic side-effects necessitate long term follow-up large population patient , also technical difficulty assess systemic cortisol level prolong period time . A similar clinical conundrum exist intranasal glucocorticoid ( INGC ) , regard systemic effect . INGCs consider first-line medical therapy allergic rhinitis effective systemic antihistamine . The common adverse effect stem local irritation nasal mucosa , systemic effect much rarer . The effect INGC HPA axis growth evaluate extensively child . Most study , especially second generation agent recommend dos , show limited HPA suppression . Despite reassure data , adverse effect INGC additive glucocorticoid preparation comorbid condition , thus caution exercise . A handful study demonstrate detrimental effect INGC therapy bone mineral density intraocular pressure . These study small sample size clearly proven whether effect result clinically relevant long term outcome , fracture . As result , study reflect current practice guideline . Cortisol level routinely determine blood , salivary urinary sample However , method provide information long term cortisol secretion , account variability HPA axis activity . There grow pool evidence show Hair Cortisol Concentration ( HCC ) examination provide reliable retrospective estimation integrate cortisol secretion period several month . Hair grow rate 1 cm/month , thus 3 cm hair would give indication cortisol level previous 3 month . HCC correlate 24h urinary cortisol level , salivary serum cortisol , support use HCC indicator cortisol level time rather point measurement . HCC evaluate several clinical setting activity HPA axis cortisol level period time interest . Studies demonstrate increased level hair cortisol patient stress well condition associate stress pregnancy , unemployment , PTSD , alcohol withdrawal , chronic pain myocardial infarction . Elevated level hair cortisol also show Cushing 's syndrome , reduce level correction disorder . No study date examine correlation use inhale intranasal corticosteroid level cortisol hair . If correlation exists , would indicate systemic absorption topical steroid turn would suggest potential systemic side effect . In addition , pending study , HCC may serve validated test determine patient prone systemic side effect , well help assess compliance .</detailed_description>
