	<detailed_description>This study prospective , unicentric , control comparison placebo , randomise double-blinded . Patients stratify three group : prostatic cancer , gynecologic cancer without chemotherapy gynecologic rectal cancer chemotherapy . Patients block-randomized research nurse receive standard dose Bifilact® probiotic placebo accord random list generate block 2 , 4 , 6 patient accord random permutation . A preliminary internal pilot study perform half expect sample size recruit . The goal analysis test assumption lead choose sample size ( N0 ) thus , validate feasibility study . Following preliminary result , sample size re-calculated interim analysis similar originally intend . It would advisable continue recruitment plan . No adjustment critical level test would require analyzes carried end study . However , another random block use high probiotic dosage randomization add preservation double bind . New random list generate strata 3:1:1 ratio ( high dose , standard dose , placebo ) compensate start late high dose group . All bottle similar aspect , identify commercial brand Bifilact . Also group , either A , B C , circle bottle , depend bottle belong placebo group , standard dose group , high dose group . Only nurse know cod system , also would assign patient group , accord randomization list . She would also hand bottle patient every week .
