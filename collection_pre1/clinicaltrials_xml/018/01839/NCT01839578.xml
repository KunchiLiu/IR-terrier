	<brief_summary>Sepsis responsible 50 % acute kidney injury ( AKI ) intensive care unit ( ICUs ) , contribute greatly multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( MODS ) . Special type continuous renal replacement therapy ( CRRT ) propose adjuvant therapy septic shock due ability remove middle molecular weight molecule inflammatory mediator involve MODS pathophysiology . These therapy call extracorporeal `` blood purification `` therapy . When CRRT use , anticoagulation require prevent clot extracorporeal circuit , possibly cause bleed select patient . Many anticoagulation strategy propose commonly used 2013 still unfractionated heparin . Regional citrate anticoagulation ( RCA ) interest alternative dramatically decrease bleed risk . The investigator hypothesize use citrate Super High Flux Continuous Veno-Venus Hemodialysis ( SHF-CVVHD ) would highly beneficial time preserve filter effectiveness via limit protein adhesion ( subsequently reduce filter pore size ( protein cake ) ) , compare heparin . Consequently , high clearance inflammatory mediator could maintain time citrate compare heparin anticoagulation . In word , duration filter use , middle molecular weight molecule cytokine clearance would great citrate compare heparin . To test hypothesis , investigator perform clinical randomized control trial aim would compare middle molecular weight molecule cytokine clearance SHF-CVVHD use RCA versus systemic heparin anticoagulation septic patient AKI .</brief_summary>
