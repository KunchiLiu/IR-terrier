	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose azacitidine give together cytarabine mitoxantrone hydrochloride treat patient high-risk acute myeloid leukemia . Drugs use chemotherapy , azacitidine , cytarabine , mitoxantrone hydrochloride , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Azacitidine may also help cytarabine mitoxantrone hydrochloride work well make cancer cell sensitive drug</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish recommended phase II dose 5-azacytidine ( azacitidine ) combine high-dose cytarabine ( HiDAC ) mitoxantrone ( mitoxantrone hydrochloride ) chemotherapy high-risk acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine complete remission ( CR ) rate follow use induction chemotherapy regimen 5-azacytidine follow high-dose cytarabine ( HiDAC ) mitoxantrone chemotherapy high-risk AML patient . II . To determine toxicity combination regimen . III . To determine disease-free survival ( DFS ) overall survival ( OS ) patient population . IV . To determine gene expression level topoisomerase II deoxycytidine kinase leukemia blast pre-treatment follow therapy 5-azacytidine . V. To collect specimen bank use future research study view elucidate predictor response epigenetic therapy . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study azacitidine . INDUCTION : Patients receive azacitidine intravenously ( IV ) 10-40 minute subcutaneously ( SC ) daily ( QD ) day 1-5 , cytarabine IV 4 hour day 6 10 , mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV 60 minute day 6 10 . CONSOLIDATION : Patients receive azacitidine IV 10-40 minute SC QD day 1-5 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients ineligible allogeneic stem cell transplantation continue maintenance . MAINTENANCE : Patients receive azacitidine IV 10-40 minute SC QD day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 28 day 1 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
