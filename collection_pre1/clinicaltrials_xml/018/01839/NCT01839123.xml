	<brief_title>Evaluation Limb Health Associated With Prosthetic Vacuum Socket System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prosthetic suspension play pivotal role amputee 's comfort . It also significantly impact amputee 's limb health . If prosthesis hold securely amputee 's limb , relative movement limb prosthetic interface cause bruising , skin irritation skin breakdown . These poor outcome uncomfortable lead much serious health condition . A positive solution create secure comfortable suspension use vacuum suspension socket . The vacuum pressure assist prevent movement socket . The clinical benefit associate vacuum suspension include volume retention , increased proprioception , secure suspension , frequently report observation wound heal . However , long term effect vacuum suspension circulation remain undetermined undocumented . This study examine vacuum suspension system health residual limb ( amputated limb ) . A vacuum socket create vacuum rigid prosthetic socket prosthetic liner seal socket . Therefore , vacuum directly apply skin residual limb .</detailed_description>
