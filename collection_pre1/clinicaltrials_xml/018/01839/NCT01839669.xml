	<brief_summary>Pes planovalgus , also call flat foot , common foot deformity characterize flattening foot 's longitudinal arch accompany dysfunction posterior tibial tendon ( `` posterior tibial tendon dysfunction '' `` PTTD '' ) . Early stage pathology think treated non-surgical therapy option like foot orthoses ( relief tendon stress mechanical unload arch ) , strengthen exercise basic physiotherapeutic measure . Recent literature clearly state urgent need high quality study evaluate propose non-surgical treatment ( Bowring 2009 , 2010 ) . There one high quality study available show benefit orthoses therapy exercise ( Kulig 2009 ) . No study date evaluate functional change pre-post dynamic movement pattern like gait stair climb . The widespread use several non-surgical treatment strategy lead extensive financial expense health care system . An optimized therapeutic strategy could eventually lead efficient health care investment . The presented proposal address late knowledge aim analyse non-surgical treatment strategy Cure Pes Planovalgus associate Complaints ( CurePPaC ) CurePPaC Study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction : Pes planovalgus flatfoot-associated complaint frequent symptom , think cause foot deformity . Concurrently , multifactorial weakness M. tibialis posterior tendon ( trauma , systemic disease , chronic tendon degeneration overuse ) lead flatten medial longitudinal arch foot . Affected patient suffer functional impairment pain . Less severe case eligible non-surgical treatment . Foot orthoses consider first line approach . Furthermore strengthen arch ankle stabilize muscle think contribute active compensation deformity . There limited evidence concern numerous therapy approach since high quality study miss . One excellent report ( Kulig et al . 2009 ) show clear benefit use foot orthoses eccentric strengthen exercise . Beside fact evidence-based guideline therapy yet develop , data available show functional benefit accompany therapy process . This would give insight mechanism behind non-surgical management strategy patient benefit functionally therapy . Purpose : The purpose randomize longitudinal intervention study evaluation therapeutic benefit three different non-surgical treatment regimen ( foot orthoses FOO , foot orthoses eccentric exercise FOE , foot orthoses sham treatment FOS ) patient Pes planovalgus accompany complaint . Furthermore analysis possible functional change gait mechanic ( kinematic kinetic view ) neuromuscular control ( electromyographic analysis ) contribute superior understanding functional change accompany non-operative management . The purpose study optimize non-surgical management patient suffer Pes planovalgus associate pain lead efficient use health care system 's financial resource . Methods : 60 patient Pes planovalgus associate complaint ( clinical diagnosis plain weight bear radiograph ) , M. tibialis posterior dysfunction ) include study . Functional impairment evaluate pre post intervention Foot-Function-Index ( FFI , German version ) . Anthropometric data recording follow preparation subject 's foot anatomical landmark retroreflective marker superficially detectable muscle ankle joint complex prepare surface electromyography ( SEMG ) electrodes . The 3D kinematic data allows inter alia calculation segmental angel low extremity measurement navicular drop . The neuromuscular activity analyse time ( on-off pattern ) amplitude domain ( gait cycle specific phase ) . Procedure : Potential participant recruit via Outpatient Clinic Department Orthopaedic Surgery Inselspital , University Hospital , Bern . After initial screening , subject randomize one three intervention group ( foot orthoses FOO , foot orthoses eccentric exercise FOE , foot orthoses sham treatment FOS ) . FOO-subjects wear custom-made foot orthoses . FOE-subjects wear individually accustomed foot orthoses perform combine monitor home training program progressively strengthen M. tibialis posterior accompany ankle stabilize muscle eccentric exercise . FOS-subjects wear custom-made sham foot orthoses without functional element treatment orthoses ( longitudinal arch support , ankle stabilizer , bowl-shaped heel rearfoot stability ) . Subjects measure pre post intervention ( 12 week ) . Measurements include primary outcome measure Foot-Function-Index ( FFI , German version : total score ) follow basic anthropometric measure . Subject preparation allow measurement 10 trial walkway stair embed force plate barefoot condition . An average step cycle 10 trial calculate biomechanical outcome measure extract . A re-test allows calculation intervention effect one-factor ANOVA ( group : treatment FOO v . FOE vs. FOS ) repeat measure .</detailed_description>
