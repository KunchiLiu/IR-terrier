	<brief_summary>The purpose research study identify factor gene ( DNA material determines makeup human body ) may associate child respond pain medication . Morphine pain medication commonly prescribe surgery hospital stay . The investigator want study factor may associate pain sensitivity , morphine requirement surgery side-effects morphine . The investigator expect information obtain research study help develop effective , safe , tailor treatment option future .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Safe effective analgesia important unmet medical need child . Despite effort promote non-pharmacologic intervention , drug treatment remain standard care child experience severe pain follow surgery . Inadequate pain relief invasive surgery , side effect analgesic morphine occur frequently 50 % child . A study patient-controlled analgesia morphine use spine surgery adolescent observe 45 % incidence postoperative nausea vomit 15 % incidence pruritis 7 % incidence respiratory depression . Among drug available , opioids , specifically morphine commonly employ . Morphine narrow therapeutic index , fatal toxicity respiratory depression . For morphine , like opioids , fine balance dose regimen optimal pain control safety term decrease morphine 's respiratory depressant/ sedative side effect . Inadequate pain relief analgesic side effect major clinical , behavioral economic consequence . Neither evidence-based dosing guideline rigorous documentation therapeutic benefit morphine ascertain pediatric patient population . Despite aggressive pain management spine surgery , finding show neither child 's pain analgesic use diminish significantly time . As , critical knowledge gap medical literature significantly impact pediatric pain management . In recognition therapeutic challenge investigator plan evaluate determinant inter-individual difference opioid analgesic responsiveness adverse effect child . Adolescents follow spine surgery great variability morphine requirement great use become old . Analgesic dose dependent appreciation interplay pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics therapeutic . These factor often poorly understood , effective control procedural pain example , remain problematic . Suitable pharmacological alternative opioid treatment moderate severe pain child surgery limit consequently need critical evaluation exist opioids research report . Recently number small study show association single nucleotide polymorphism gene pain pathway , alter pain response stimulus alter response opioids follow painful procedure . Age , gender , cultural influence , anxiety , type surgical procedure genetic factor influence response .</detailed_description>
