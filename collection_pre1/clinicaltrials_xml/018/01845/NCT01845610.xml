	<brief_summary>Complementary food supplement ( CFS ) , fortify product mixed infant 's usual complementary food , potential improve nutrition among infant . In Africa , maize major staple food use complementary feeding . Compared rice wheat , maize high level phytates , bind trace element iron zinc , inhibit absorption . The impact CFS product context maize-based diet well investigate . This study test two newly develop fat-based CFS product make soy . The first product fortify fat-based spread contain essential fatty acid add docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) arachidonic acid ( ARA ) , phytase improve iron zinc bioavailability . The second product fortify fat-based product contain essential fatty acid . Both product contain soy . The enrichment product essential fatty acid particular interest South African context , consumer expose high linoleic acid ( LA ) diet due inclusion mostly high LA-containing sunflower oil food preparation . The CFS product could contribute towards restore balance LA alpha-linolenic acid ( ALA ) intake . The result study provide evidence whether two type fortify CFS potential address malnutrition ( linear growth ) improve psychomotor development infant . If proven effective , approach provide multiple nutrient make available infant develop world may lead sustainable action .</brief_summary>
