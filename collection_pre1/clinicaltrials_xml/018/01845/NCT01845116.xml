	<detailed_description>Rationale Omegaven® Treatment Unlike conventional intravenous fat emulsion , Omegaven® comprise solely fish oil contain primarily omega-3 fatty acid . Animal study show IV lipid emulsion fish oil high eicosapentaenic docosahexaenoic acid reduce impairment bile flow see cholestasis cause conventional fat emulsion ( 1,2 ) . By administer Omegaven® place conventional phytosterol/soybean fat emulsion , cholestasis may reverse patient able maintained adequate PN able ingest adequate nutrition enterally . References 1 .
