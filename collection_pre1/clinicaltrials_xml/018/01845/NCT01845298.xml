	<brief_summary>The investigator ' objective describe variability rifampicin absorption , marker inflammation gut damage , intestinal absorptive capacity , intestinal permeability among HIV-infected volunteer . Rifampicin least well absorbed first-line anti-tuberculosis drug . Rifampicin malabsorption frequently observe HIV-infected patient active tuberculosis , predict patient factor CD4+ T cell count , viral load , presence diarrhea . The mechanisms rifampicin malabsorption HIV-infected patient unknown . An understanding mechanism rifampicin malabsorption could eventually lead new therapeutic target , ultimate goal improve HIV/tuberculosis treatment outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The dose scheme rifampicin treatment tuberculosis develop pre-HIV era , achieve target concentration site infection important successful outcome . Rifampicin least well absorbed first-line anti-TB drug may depend active transport across intestinal barrier . Rifampicin malabsorption frequently observe HIV/tuberculosis patient , predict patient factor CD4+ T cell count , viral load , presence diarrhea . Most importantly , loss rifampicin absorptive capacity set HIV infection would explain inferior treatment outcome characteristic HIV-associated tuberculosis , include early mortality , relapse completion therapy , development rifampicin-resistant infection anti-tuberculosis therapy . The gut-associated lymphoid tissue site early dramatic lymphocyte depletion HIV+ patient , near complete loss intestinal CCR5+ CD4+ T cell within first week infection . Lymphocyte depletion accompany loss intestinal epithelial barrier integrity , recent attention focus potential role bacterial translocation across damage ( `` leaky '' ) intestinal barrier . In support model , systemic immune activation marker show predict HIV progression well CD4+ T cell count HIV viral load . Independent potential role bacterial translocation , damage gut epithelium may profound consequence HIV-infected patient . The impact disease progression enterocyte 's capacity absorb specific drug nutrient adequately explore . Loss rifampicin absorptive capacity set HIV infection would explain inferior treatment outcome characteristic HIV-associated tuberculosis , include early mortality , relapse completion therapy , development rifampicin resistant infection anti-tuberculosis therapy . Therefore , propose pilot study relationship immune activation , rifampicin absorption , intestinal capacity carrier-mediated transport permeability , lay foundation K23 Career Development Award application Division AIDS , NIAID . Rifampicin an-antibacterial compound rifamycin family use treatment certain bacterial infection , cornerstone first-line treatment regimen tuberculosis . Polymorphisms specific drug uptake transporter gene , SLCO1B1 , lead significant variability pharmacokinetics rifampicin . Other host factor negatively influence rifampicin absorption well understood , particularly high-risk group HIV-infected patient active tuberculosis . Long-term use rifampicin rarely associated adverse effect include flu-like illness anemia . Both effect cease termination drug . Neither effect report single dose administration . Hypersensitivity reaction present rash also report prolonged use rifampicin , would rare single-dose administration . The risk associate rifampicin minimize study pharmacokinetics administration single dose , rather prolong use . Rifampicin potent inducer cytochrome p450 enzyme system involve metabolism many commonly use therapeutic compound . For reason , exclude participant receive prescription medication clinically significant drug-drug interaction rifampicin .</detailed_description>
