	<brief_title>A Dose-Optimization Study Initial Treatment Dysplastic Barrett 's Esophagus With trūFreeze™ Spray Cryotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This adaptive dose-escalation clinical trial use trūFreeze™ spray cryotherapy treatment dysplastic Barrett 's Esophagus clinical setting . Participants enrol cohort 15 . Each cohort receive similarly dose spray cryotherapy treatment , base outcomes previous cohort . Participants receive one treatment spray cryotherapy per protocol follow clinically . During next scheduled clinical endoscopy , participant assess percent regression disease follow spray cryotherapy treatment . A determination make regard effectiveness dose base number subject achieve primary outcome criterion ( &gt; = 50 percent BE segment regression ) . The first cohort 15 participant receive upper endoscopy systematic image esophagus take research study receive treatment spray cryotherapy use trūFreeze™ system . These participant clinical follow-up endoscopy schedule approximately 2 month initial spray cryotherapy procedure . During follow-up endoscopy , physician ask provide estimate percent regression disease well systematic image esophagus . These image send central panel mask expert assess percent regression disease compare image take prior first ablation procedure . Interim review potential dose effectiveness occur 7 11 participant complete follow-up visit . If interim review least 5 participant experience sub-therapeutic response , dose consider sub-therapeutic meeting definition `` fully effective , '' cohort close new enrollment , enrollment new cohort next high dose begin . If interim review le 5 participant experience sub-therapeutic response , enrollment cohort continue . If/when enrollment cohort reach 15 participant decision make regard effectiveness dose . If dose find `` ineffective '' `` partially effective , '' new cohort individual enrol prescribed higher start dose . If dose find `` fully effective , '' confirmatory cohort enrol dose confirm result . Enrollment continue `` fully effective '' therapeutic dose spray cryotherapy identify confirm two cohort 15 participant .</detailed_description>
