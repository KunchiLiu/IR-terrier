	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial Improve Outcomes Patients With Resected Pancreatic Cancer ( Azacitidine , Abraxane , Gemcitabine )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This trial patient resect pancreatic adenocarcinoma conclude adjuvant therapy deem unable receive adjuvant therapy elevate CA 19-9 node positive margin positive disease . CA 19-9 elevation define two level &gt; institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) take least 2 week apart . These level measure adjuvant therapy conclude upon decision adjuvant therapy offer . Patients randomize one two arm . Subjects enrol due node + disease R1 resection must able undergo randomization within 3 month finish adjuvant therapy decision unable take adjuvant therapy . Patients enrol due CA 19-9 elevation enroll time adjuvant therapy complete . Group A , treatment arm , start CC-486 ( oral azacitidine ) . Group B , control arm , receive additional therapy . Both Arms evaluate CA 19-9 CT scan every 3 month . When patient visible disease recurrence imaging , CC-486 stop group start first-line chemotherapy ( possibly abraxane gemcitabine ) . GOALS : To improve progression free survival high risk patient resect pancreatic adenocarcinoma node positive disease , margin positive disease , and/or elevation CA 19-9 treat CC-486 ( oral azacitidine ) compare observation completion adjuvant therapy . To improve response rate first-line chemotherapy ( partial complete response ) recurrence patient treat CC-486 complete adjuvant therapy . To improve overall survival patient resect pancreatic adenocarcinoma treat CC-486 . To evaluate resect pancreatic cancer tissue biopsy time recurrence epigenetic genetic alteration determine pharmacodynamic effect CC-486 . To evaluate resect pancreatic cancer tissue identify predictive signature possible recurrence benefit hypomethylating therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Understand voluntarily sign informed consent form . Age great 18 year time signing informed consent form . Able adhere study visit schedule protocol requirement . Subjects must histologically confirm pancreatic adenocarcinoma R0 ( negative margin ) R1 ( microscopically positive margin ) resection . Subjects must finish adjuvant therapy , include chemotherapy and/or chemoradiation therapy determine unable take adjuvant therapy . Although patient expect complete chemoradiation chemotherapy per physician recommendation , patient unable complete chemotherapy ± radiation therapy secondary dose limit toxicity eligible provide meet study criterion . Subjects enrol due node + disease R1 resection must able undergo randomization within 3 month finish adjuvant therapy decision unable take adjuvant therapy . Patients enrol due CA 199 elevation enroll time adjuvant therapy complete . All previous cancer therapy include radiation , chemotherapy , surgery , must discontinue least 4 week prior treatment study Subjects must either CA 199 value &gt; institutional ULN two separate check least 2 week apart OR R1 resection margin OR N1 nodal disease regardless CA 199 level Subjects must free visible disease imaging ( CT , PETCT MRI ) evaluate chest , abdomen , pelvis within 28 day enrollment study . Life expectancy great 12 week ECOG performance status less equal 1 study entry Subjects must normal organ marrow function Free prior malignancy great equal 5 year exception currently treat basal cell , squamous cell carcinoma skin , carcinoma situ cervix breast . Women childbearing potential advise avoid become pregnant men advise father child receive treatment CC486 nabpaclitaxel . All men woman childbearing potential must use effective method birth control throughout study three month complete treatment . Women childbearing potential must negative serum urine βhCG pregnancy test screening . Subjects must &lt; Grade 2 preexist peripheral neuropathy ( per CTCAE ) Any serious medical condition , laboratory abnormality , psychiatric illness would prevent subject signing informed consent form . Pregnant breastfeed woman . Use chemotherapy , radiotherapy , experimental drug therapy within 4 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) prior enrollment study recover adverse event ≥ grade 1 due agent administer 4 week earlier except stable grade 2 neuropathy . Subjects may receive concomitant investigational agent . Known suspect hypersensitivity 5azacitidine mannitol Known positive HIV infectious hepatitis , type B C. HIV patient increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Any known gastrointestinal disorder would preclude oral administration 5azacitidine .</criteria>
