	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : Auto immune pancreatitis ( AIP ) , benign pancreatic disease certain morphological form mimic pancreatic malignancy radiological appearance . There singe diagnostic test accurately differentiate two condition . In past , AIP account 27 % Whipple resection perform suspected adenocarcinoma . AIMS : To evaluate efficacy Secretin assist Magnetic resonance cholangio pancreatography ( MRCP ) differentiate AIP pancreatic malignancy . METHODS : 100 patient suspect AIP consent participate study undergo secretin MRCP addition standard investigation . Patients categorize AIP pancreatic malignancy base result follow . Follow eventually give true diagnosis patient pancreatic malignancy undergo pancreatic surgery pancreatic tissue examine histopathologist . AIP patient undergo steroid trial give true diagnosis . The preliminary diagnosis result base standard investigation without inclusion secretin MRCP compare true diagnosis .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A total 100 patient suspicion Auto Immune Pancreatitis identify multidisciplinary pancreatic cancer clinic Johns Hopkins Pancreatitis clinic Division Gastroenterology , Johns Hopkins Hospital . After write , informed consent obtain ; preliminary screening do include medical history physical examination include weight vital sign . Serum immunoglobulin G4 ( IgG4 ) level also evaluate . If patient meet exclusion/inclusion criterion , screen eligibility sign inform consent , include study . Study investigator and/or delegate complete patient demographic form , medical history form , baseline physical examination , baseline laboratory evaluation concomitant medication evaluation per protocol . Any investigational procedure endoscopic ultrasonography - fine-needle aspiration ( EUS - FNA ) esophagogastroduodenoscopy ( EGD ) papillary biopsy IgG4 assist differentiation AIP Pancreatic malignancy may perform base treat physician 's discretion . Involvement organ AIP Pancreatic malignancy obtain base medical history , examination imaging finding . The patient subject MRI MRCP MRCP perform two stage namely injection secretin intravenous injection 0.4mcg/Kg synthetic human secretin ( CHIROSTIM , Human Secretin , CHIRHOCLIN Inc. , Burtonsville , MD ) . All subject give 3 cup ( approximately 500-600cc ) pineapple juice 5-10 minute image procedure . Pineapple juice act negative oral contrast null signal stomach duodenum , thereby suppress gastrointestinal overlap pancreas . MR Examination perform use 3.0 T magnet include non contrast enhance scan follow gadolinium enhance scanning , perform arterial dominant , venous dominant late phase . The secretin MRCP perform serial breath-hold T2-weighted sequence run first 8-12 min intravenous administration secretin . Based result investigation , patient categorize suspected AIP suspect Pancreatic malignancy . Patients suspect malignancy eventually undergo surgical resection pancreas treat physician pancreatic tissue examination provide true diagnosis . Patients suspect AIP undergo steroid trial least 3 month , end repeat MRI , secretin MRCP perform diagnosis confirm base response steroid therapy .</detailed_description>
