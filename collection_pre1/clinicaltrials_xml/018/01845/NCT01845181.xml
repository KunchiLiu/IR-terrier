	<brief_summary>This phase I , single-center , randomize , double-blind , dose escalation study without therapeutic benefit , PBF-680 administer single oral ascend dose young male healthy volunteer . Up four different rise dos test group 8 participant . Thus , four group participate one participating . For dose level / group participant randomize active placebo 2 participant randomly assign placebo 6 active drug . First , one volunteer receive active drug ( subgroup 1 ) ; 48h safety tolerability assessment second subgroup 3 volunteer receive 2 active drug 1 placebo ; 48h safety tolerability parameter assessment third subgroup 4 volunteer receive 3 active drug 1 placebo . After evaluation safety parameter dose level process replicate one week afterwards follow dosage . The aim study : Primary : - To assess safety tolerability single escalate oral dos PBF-680 young male healthy subject lead determination maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . Secondary : - To assess pharmacokinetics PBF-680 single rise oral dos healthy young male subject . - To ass preliminary pharmacodynamic effect . - To evaluate adenosine A1 receptor antagonism blood sample healthy volunteer cause PBF-680 administration</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>`` First-in-human '' Study To Assess Safety Tolerability PBF-680 Male Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In order ass safety tolerability single escalate oral dos PBF-680 , safe measurement ( ECG , vital sign , blood chemistry hematology ) conduct , follow-up study course . - Physical Examination . Physical examination data collect screen end study . All occur abnormality display subject . Vital Signs . Vital sign ( DINAMAP V100 ) include measurement blood pressure , pulse respiratory rate digital axillary temperature obtain screening , study study completion ( follow ) . All occur abnormality display subject . - Adverse Events . All information obtain adverse event display tallied treatment /dose . Laboratory variable ( Hematology , Biochemistry Urinalysis ) : Clinical laboratory data collect screening , study study completion ( follow ) . All subject value outside normal range variable identify . All occur abnormality display subject . - Electrocardiographic Evaluation . An electrocardiogram perform several time , screening , study completion study ( follow ) . Description ECG interval also do . All occur abnormality identify . Also , secondary variable evaluate : - Pharmacokinetic profile analysis . The variable pharmacokinetic evaluation parameter defines bioavailability extend rate Ln [ AUC 0t ] ( AUC : area curve ) , Ln [ Cmax ] experimental product placebo . For purpose necessary kinetic parameter determine mean non compartmental method value obtain quantitative analysis plasma level PBF-680 . The following pharmacokinetic parameter obtain individual plasma concentration versus time profile use standard method , data warrant - Pharmacodynamic effect . To ass preliminary pharmacodynamic effect PBF-680 dose level , subjective test ( VAS ) ( LSEQ ) different time post-drug administration conduct . Effects CNS ( Central Nervous system ) evaluate analyze change observe different time subjective assessment scale .</detailed_description>
