	<brief_summary>The study base master thesis show 72 % patient head neck cancer admit Danish hospital ( Rigshospitalet , Copenhagen ) develop refeeding syndrome admission . Refeeding syndrome characterized decrease plasma phosphate level , develop reintroduction adequate food intake long period starvation semi-starvation . This normally happen within 7 day reintroduction food . The aim study minimize incidence refeeding syndrome group patient reintroduce food slowly provide diet low sodium high slowly absorb carbohydrate prevention diet ( i.e . give potential decrease plasma phosphate level appear ) . Both patient eat normally , patient eat tubes patient central vein catheter include study , data evaluate together separately .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A large weight loss result long period ( &gt; 30 day ) starvation semi-starvation result metabolic adaptation decrease food intake . To prevent degradation muscle mass gluco- ketogenic amino acid use energy production , shift gluconeogenesis lipolysis occur . Lipids therefore become primary energy fuel , body adapts use ketone body instead glucose . The reduction glucose metabolism result decrease need amino acid use gluconeogenesis . This mean less amino acid need gluconeogenesis therefore important muscle mass preserve . At time lipid store degrade , intracellular depletion phosphate , potassium magnesium occur . The serum level electrolytes stay within normal range long body adaptive starvation state . A quick reintroduction food body result major glucose-induced increase insulin secretion stimulate transport glucose , phosphate , potassium magnesium plasma cell . Because extracellular blood volume much small intracellular , influx electrolyte intracellular space result quick large decrease plasma level . Likewise , influx glucose mean enter glucolysis , need phosphate co-factor thiamine , production ATP , increase . The increased production adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) activate membrane pump reestablish membrane potential . This mean sodium transport large intracellular space small extracellular , subsequent fluid retention edema formation . Therefore slowly introduce diet low sodium high slowly absorb carbohydrate might prevent development refeeding syndrome .</detailed_description>
