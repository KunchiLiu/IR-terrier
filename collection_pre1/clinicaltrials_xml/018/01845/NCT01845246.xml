	<brief_summary>Objectives : Main objective : assess impact intervention optimize dose colistin base plasma level patient infection due multi-drug resistant gram negative bacillus . The impact evaluate term clinical microbiological outcome , toxicity . Secondary objective : 1 . To determine percentage patient reach plasma level consider adequate ( Cmax / MIC 8-10 ) treatment infection due gram-negative bacillus susceptible colistin , cohort patient treat standard dos drug without adjust dose . 2 . To analyze possible emergence bacterial resistance drug relationship calculate colistin pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic index . Methods : Design : open control trial , blind analyst , perform thre tertiary care Hospitals Barcelona . Subjects : Patients attend consecutively 2012 2013 infect multi-drug resistant gram negative bacillus treat colistin . Sample size : 142 case . Intervention : Once detect infection require treatment colistin , patient randomize receive intervention , 1:1 ratio . The intervention perform Infectious Diseases physician consist recommendation dose colistin base plasma level 48 hour treatment onset . Variables : peak colistin level 48 hour treatment onset , clinical , analytical microbiological data baseline follow-up patient . Outcome measure : clinical , microbiological toxicity data . Analysis : Comparison patient characteristic outcome variable patient receive intervention . The analysis do intention treat , biological effectiveness compliance protocol .</brief_summary>
