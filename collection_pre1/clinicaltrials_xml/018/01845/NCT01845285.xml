	<brief_title>A Registry Evaluate Direct Flow Medical Transcatheter Aortic Valve System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patient population include patient candidate transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR ) . According routine practice , heart team ( interventional cardiologist cardiothoracic surgeon ) make choice use Direct Flow Medical Aortic Valve System , compare available TAVR prosthesis , basis clinical surgical consideration . Therefore , valve implanted heart team decide product best suit specific patient . In order enrol Registry , patient must candidate implantation Direct Flow Medical Transcatheter Aortic Valve System , base commercial indication state Instructions Use . Therefore , candidate study must meet follow criterion ( Indications Use ) : 1 . Age &gt; 70 year old 2 . Severe aortic valve stenosis determine echocardiogram Doppler : - mean gradient &gt; 40 mmHg peak jet velocity &gt; 4.0 m/s AND - aortic valve area ≤0.8 cm2 aortic valve area index ≤0.5 cm2/m2 3 . Symptomatic aortic valve stenosis ( angina , congestive heart failure , NYHA Functional Class ≥ II , syncope ) . 4 . Patient extreme risk candidate open surgical aortic valve repair site Investigators ( interventional cardiologist cardiothoracic surgeon ) agree medical factor preclude operation , base conclusion probability death serious morbidity exceed probability meaningful improvement due patient 's co-morbidities ( , limit , severe COPD , porcelain aorta , previous thorax irradiation ) logistic EuroSCORE ≥ 20 . All Registry clinical evaluation test perform generally consider standard care TAVR patient . When recommendation conflict standard care Registry site , standard care prevail . In addition standard care , Sponsor recommend one brief additional evaluation ( EQ-5D quality life measure ) conduct . Failure perform evaluation shall consider protocol deviation . Baseline Clinical Evaluation - Medical History Physical Exam - 12 lead ECG Arrhythmia Assessment - Logistic EuroSCORE/STS Score - New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional status - Modified Rankin Score Assessment ( mRS ) - Current Cardiac Medications Baseline Imaging Studies - Transthoracic Echo ( TTE ) - CT Scan ( ECG trigger , contrast enhance ) - Aorto-Iliac Angiogram : 1 . Peripheral Evaluation 2 . Coronary Evaluation All patient clinical follow-up hospital discharge , 30 day , 12 month annually 3 year undergo follow evaluation : - Physical Exam - 12 lead ECG Arrhythmia Assessment - New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) functional status - Modified Rankin Score Assessment ( mRS ) symptomatic stroke - Current Cardiac Medications - Transthoracic echo ( TTE ) Patients heart team plan use Direct Flow Medical Transcatheter Aortic Valve System valve , inform DISCOVER Registry consent participate require . This study intend monitor clinical condition patient period 3 year operation . By agree participate , patient agree undergo clinical assessment specific test certain interval ( prior procedure ; implantation ; hospital discharge , 30 day procedure , 1 year , 2 3 year later ) ; patient also agree collection daThe purpose Registry monitor outcome data Direct Flow Medical Transcatheter Aortic Valve System Post Market phase . The primary outcome interest freedom all-cause mortality 30 day . The result pivotal CE mark study ( IP 010 ) yield 30 day freedom all-cause mortality rate 97 % . Should `` true '' rate 97 % , N=250 patient would provide estimate rate margin error 2 % , 95 % confidence .</detailed_description>
