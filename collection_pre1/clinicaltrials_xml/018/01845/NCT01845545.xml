	<brief_summary>Investigators propose feasibility pilot study cluster randomise control trial . The propose trial evaluate effect economic intervention ( microfinance ) self-help group poor marginalise woman three province northern India , upon health community , focus child five year . This feasibility pilot study determine whether accurate data collect mortality mean house house survey register births death . The feasibility stage also determine whether village volunteer accurately weigh child five record weight alongside financial data already record self-help group . If data accurate collect reliably , investigator calculate power sample size need future cluster randomise trial , well analyse preliminary result current project . The investigator evaluate health outcome , relate two Millennium Development Goals : number child five year age underweight five mortality rate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Effect Microfinance Under 5 Health Rural India</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Microfinance process whereby small loan give poor family develop country help overcome short term economic shock ( natural disaster ill health ) make small investment improve standard living ( eg livestock . Microfinance show contribute reduce poverty ( particularly female participant ) improve health village economy . The Rojiroti scheme microfinance run several impoverished state Northern India ten year . This low cost scheme active state Bihar , Madhya Pradesh Uttar Pradesh serve much poor beneficiary reach mainstream microfinance . It work establish self-help group ( predominantly woman schedule caste ) . Initially member group contribute money - small sum per week . After 3-6 month become eligible emergency loan medical emergency general purpose loan , investment livestock etc.. These loan administer locally charity `` Centre Promoting Sustainable Livelihoods '' ( CPSL ) . Rojiroti UK receive grant Department International Development ( DfID ) 3 year expansion Rojiroti programme . Most participant Rojiroti scheme live rural hamlet `` tolas '' , comprise several hundred people earn live share crop , tenant farmer . The investigator evaluate feasibility collect mortality data ( directly tola registered death ) feasibility village volunteer weigh child five record weight , along self-help group data . If data collection prove feasible , investigator conduct pilot cluster randomise trial immediate vs. delay microfinance 50 tolas Bihar . Trial outcomes mortality weight age Z score , weight height z-scores mid upper arm circumference child less 5 year age . Main centre Rojiroti already establish northern Indian province Bihar , Madhya Pradesh Uttar Pradesh . In study , investigator plan enrol tolas Bihar . In feasibility study 10 tolas arm . If data reach acceptable standard accuracy completeness , investigator continue study 40 tolas arm ( total 50 tolas per arm , 100 altogether ) . The data analysis undertaken School Medicine , University Nottingham . Design A feasibility pilot study cluster randomise control trial ( RCT ) . The unit randomisation tola . A control tola , pair intervention tola , randomly select similar characteristic ( size agroeconomic zone ) early intervention tola . The control tola least 15km away intervention site ( avoid self-help group set word mouth ) close enough practical data collection . The control tola receive microfinance intervention 18 month randomisation . Selection randomisation intervention sit The investigator select tolas Bihar province feasibility study ( 10 intervention 10 control ) . It important include control tolas feasibility stage , investigator think challenge complete accurate data collection great control tolas . Pairs tolas select CPSL detail provide team University Nottingham secure , password protect spreadsheet , tola identify code number . The Nottingham team randomise one pair intervention control group . Randomisation stratify agroeconomic region ( low , moderate heavy annual rainfall ) . Consent randomisation Initial discussion take place CPSL staff woman tolas prior randomisation . The project proceed tola sufficient village woman ( around 10 ) express interest participate self-help group . The idea immediate delay intervention group discuss woman , CPSL staff . Women option agree go ahead self-help group , without randomisation collection health outcome data . The investigator keep record demographic characteristic tola take part well . Tolas agree participate randomise immediate delay intervention group . Randomisation take place remotely tolas informed CPSL study arm randomise . Evaluating accuracy completeness data collection More one self-help group may set tola outcome data collect tola whole , order measure effect intervention family self-help group indirect effect tola dweller part group . Accuracy data collection record evaluated field visit CPSL staff . At baseline visit , CPSL staff village volunteer independently : - Estimate , use questionnaire , total population ( population 5 year ) tola number death last year ( deaths child 5 year ) . - Record weight , height mid upper arm circumference age child 5 , use scale measure provide CPSL . These data enter spreadsheet CPSL staff transfer team Nottingham calculate percentage concordance . Concordance 75 % great record CPSL worker village volunteer population mortality data deem acceptable accuracy . Concordance five weight ( one decimal place ) 75 % child take acceptable . As well check accuracy weigh weight recording , CPSL staff determine number child five weighed ( e.g . child temporarily absent village ill ) . Data also collect immunisation rate . The investigator apply access data register death tola , provincial government investigator use check validity mortality data obtain questionnaire . Statistical analysis plan Sample size power calculation : This perform inform future RCT , use data collect part current study . If sufficient , reliable data available end feasibility stage , preliminary power calculation perform determine whether pilot study might detect clinically important difference mortality , proportion underweight weight age z score . If , trial move pilot status definitive trial . Published estimate nutrition Bihar date back 2006 suggest 55 % five Bihar underweight ( 61 % amongst child schedule caste ) . This may well change considerably last 6 year . This pilot study provide current estimate baseline prevalence mortality underweight . The sample size calculation cluster randomise trial describe Hayes et al use . Type analysis : In pilot study future trial , intention treat analysis use possible i.e . tola randomise receive microfinance early late , data include irrespective whether self-help group microfinance run successfully . Statistics test : We compare proportion child underweight mortality rate last year ( death past year / population tola ) intervention control tolas . This do baseline 18 month establishment self-help group early intervention tola . In order estimate current tola population , investigator use questionnaire administer CPSL worker child weigh . An adjusted risk ratio ( RR ) 95 % confidence interval calculate , allow potential confounding effect pre-intervention prevalence underweight mortality rate . As cluster randomise trial base small population unit ( tolas ) , investigator allow correlation within zone . Planned exploratory analysis : The investigator explore whether data collect maternal literacy year school receive . If data available , investigator compare effectiveness intervention accord whether mother literate illiterate whether receive least 5 year school . Change primary outcome : In initial study protocol , primary outcome measure mortality rate among child five year age overall mortaility tola . However , consideratation , change mean weight height z-score ( WHZ ) child five year age . Given short duration study period ( 18 month ) , thought effect intervention mortaility rate may evident study period . WHZ marker acute malnutrion waste Children severe wasting ( WHZ &lt; −3 SD ) 9.4-fold high chance die moderate wasting ( WHZ −3 −2 SD ) 3.0-fold high chance die compare nonmalnourished counterpart . WHZ therefore select primary outcome measure strongly associate mortality may affect intervention within short duration study period . This change protocol make prior randomisation baseline data collection report protocol publication .</detailed_description>
