	<brief_summary>The purpose research study learn use statin patient nephrotic syndrome could lower risk blood clot . Nephrotic syndrome collection sign symptom occur glomeruli -the tiny filter work kidney- leak protein urine . One symptom associate nephrotic syndrome hyperlipidemia : much bad cholesterol ( LDL ) . This bad cholesterol could link increase risk blood clot patient nephrotic syndrome . The study doctor would like see take statin drug reduce amount bad cholesterol could reduce risk blood clot .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Venous thromboembolic ( VTE ) event common nephrotic syndrome ( NS ) occur 30 % patient systematically screen . The investigator propose explore novel mechanism increase clot formation NS . To date , consistently identify underlying risk factor VTEs severe hypoalbuminemia relate NS . The underlie pathophysiology relate VTE NS remain poorly understood previously ascribe dysregulation pro- anticoagulant clotting factor due urinary protein loss reflect low serum albumin . However , direct evidence mechanism inconsistent relatively poor . Another feature NS severe hyperlipidemia also correlate hypoalbuminemia . In severely hyperlipidemic state ( e.g . Familial Hypercholesterolemia ) , level oxidize low-density lipoprotein ( oxLDL ) markedly elevate . Forms oxidize LDL interact monocytes macrophage lead expression Tissue Factor ( TF ) , procoagulant molecule . Furthermore , monocytes macrophage activate fashion also release microparticles , small cell-membrane derived vesicle , also express TF participate initiate intravascular clot formation . investigator hypothesize hyperlipidemia nephrotic syndrome lead elevation oxidize LDL turn , elevation microparticle Tissue Factor ( MP-TF ) activity . The investigator also hypothesize serum albumin level inversely correlate hyperlipidemia well oxLDL level MP-TF activity . Here , investigator study effect treatment HMGCoA reductase inhibitor ( statin ) ox LDL MP-TF activity patient NS .</detailed_description>
