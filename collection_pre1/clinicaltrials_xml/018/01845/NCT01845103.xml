	<detailed_description>This prospective single arm study Cardiogenesis PEARL 8.0 Handpiece Delivery System . The PEARL 8.0 Handpiece allows TMR laser energy direct heart small port 8 mm size . The purpose study demonstrate 30 day mortality rate among patient receive device le historical rate plus non-inferiority margin . In recent study 34 patient treat PEARL 8.0 device , 3 ( 8.8 % ) experience 30 day mortality . Among 132 patient original PMA trial treat SoloGrip III Handpiece , similar device deliver identical energy , 30 day mortality rate 5.3 % ( 7/132 ) . In Post-Approval Study SoloGrip III Handpiece , 2/72 prospectively enrolled patient die within first 30 day . Therefore , weighted average Pre-market post-market study calculate ( 4.4 % ) serve historical rate . This trial monitor success futility accord Bayesian adaptive design . Based prior history , assume patient accrue rate approximately 1 patient per month therefore , 30 day mortality know currently enrol patient time new patient enrol . The success stop boundary study 0/10 1/22 . Thus , death observe among first 10 patient , study stop success . If 1 death observe among first 10 patient , study continue enroll . If among first 22 patient , 1 death observe ( additional death ) , study stop success . At time , 2 death observe , study stop futility . A secondary objective ass effect channel number 30 day mortality rate justify label claim risk early post-operative ( 30 day ) mortality associate increase number channel , function operation device .</detailed_description>
