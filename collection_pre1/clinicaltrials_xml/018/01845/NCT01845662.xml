	<brief_summary>Purpose : Non-traumatic rupture spleen suspect patient ( especially young men ) present abdominal pain history acute infectious myeloproliferative disorder . Preoperative imaging study hemodynamically stable patient may obviate need surgery even presence massive hemoperitoneum . The purpose research inform acute management spontaneous rupture suspect order avoid surgery appropriate , rationalise angiographic intervention blood transfusion . Hypothesis : Indentifying cause injury help target preventative intervention . Background : Non-traumatic rupture spleen rare condition . It may occur diseased spleen secondary variety pathology include malaria myeloproliferative disorder . In case rupture may occur apparently normal spleen . The incidence , symptom , cause , therapy prognosis poorly define . The investigator , therefore , propose extension retrospective analysis conduct , present published 2003 examine case non-traumatic splenic rupture treat Ziv Medical Centre last 26 year present . Methods : Analysis medical note patient spontaneous splenic rupture medical archive . The investigator hope determine true incidence condition within local population , increasingly diverse origin , travel incidence predispose infectious disease ; devise practical protocol safe diagnosis management , especially non-operative intervention grow safety effectiveness . Discussion : Although rare , spontaneous splenic rupture may fatal suspect treated inappropriately . Understanding pitfall diagnosis management well informs decision making towards improve care patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Non-traumatic rupture spleen rare condition . It may occur diseased spleen suspect patient ( especially young men ) present abdominal pain history acute infectious myeloproliferative disorder . Rarely , rupture may occur within apparently normal spleen . The incidence , symptom , cause , therapy prognosis poorly define . We , therefore , propose extension retrospective analysis already presented 2003 examine case non-traumatic splenic rupture treat Ziv Medical Centre last 26 year rationalise treatment plan take consideration pitfall complication management care outcome patient improve . Methods : Patients diagnosis non-traumatic splenic rupture identify hospital database , medical record retrieve analysed determine actual diagnosis examine management outcomes . Time frame : The retrospective data last 26 year analyse next year . Endpoints : This retrospective study . Our record indicate non-traumatic splenic rupture rare diagnosis , few 50 patient list diagnosis , few still , examination medical record reveal actual diagnosis . Inclusion criterion : All patient review medical record indicate non-traumatic rupture spleen . Exclusion criterion : Patients antecedent trauma . Statistical analysis : Data subject statistical analysis use IBM SPSS incremental risk calculator software . Budget : need Ethics : This study focus analysis medical record . Supplementary information patient health care staff collect . There interviews questionnaire plan data treatment outcome discuss outside context scientific debate ( include presentation publication ) .</detailed_description>
