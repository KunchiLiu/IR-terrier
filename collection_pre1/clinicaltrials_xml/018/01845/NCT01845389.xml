	<brief_title>Comparative Study Between Continuous Epidural Anesthesia And Continuous Spinal Anesthesia Using Wiley™ Spinal Catheter</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Geriatric patient significantly high incidence morbidity morality surgery compare young age group commonly respiratory , circulatory renal problem [ 1 ] . Transurethral resection prostate ( TURP ) gold standard treatment elderly patient bladder outlet obstruction . TURP procedure associate high morbidity rate include bleeding , TURP syndrome , bladder perforation , hypothermia disseminate intravascular coagulation intraoperative early postoperative period . Therefore , become important keep stable anesthesia minimizes side effect . Detection complication quite difficult general anesthesia compare regional anesthesia . Thus Regional technique may well tolerate elderly patient undergo TURP advantage minimize blood loss thromboembolic event [ 2 ] . Subarachnoid single dose injection provide potent blockade fast onset extension duration difficult predict [ 3 ] . Continuous epidural anesthesia catheter placement offer flexibility extend , intensify , maintain block well provide postoperative analgesia [ 4 ] . Continuous spinal anesthesia consist introduce catheter subarachnoid space maintain blockade repeat anesthetic injection . The possibility fractionate local anesthetic dosage along time allow fast onset good blockade quality less hemodynamic change [ 5 ] . Recent study [ 6 ] report pain score patient receive continuous spinal anesthesia significantly low receive continuous femoral nerve block . Advantages continuous spinal anesthesia include follow : ( ) Prior placement catheter induction area facilitate surgical schedule . ( b ) Spinal anesthesia may induce catheter patient position surgery , thereby lessen potential hypotension . ( c ) The low dos local anesthetic intermittently inject eliminate possibility systemic toxic reaction . ( ) Repeated injection small dose local anesthetic solution facilitates obtain right level anesthesia decrease cardiovascular instability induction . ( e ) Employing low dose local anesthetic shortens recovery period . ( f ) Anesthesia prolong duration surgery uncertain . ( g ) A definite end point ( aspiration cerebrospinal fluid ) assure catheter right place enhance likelihood successful anesthesia . ( h ) Subarachnoid narcotic may administer surgical procedure continue recovery period provide long-lasting postoperative analgesia [ 7 ] . The disadvantage continuous spinal anesthesia follow : ( ) Additional time required place catheter right place , may occasionally prove difficult . ( b ) Spinal headache possible . ( c ) There potential catheter breakage , infection , nerve trauma , hemorrhage ( potential complication , however , rarely document previous clinical setting ) . The primary factor limit use continuous spinal anesthesia belief large size available spinal catheter require insertion large spinal needle result incidence post dural puncture headache ( PDPH ) young patient unacceptable [ 7 ] . The Wiley Spinal™ ( Epimed ; Johnstown , NY ) catheter innovative flexible cannula needle design convenient intrathecal access reduces PDPH [ 8 ] . We hypothesize use less anesthetic continuous spinal anesthesia Wiley spinal catheter would offer hemodynamic stability less side effect compare continuous epidural anesthesia patient undergoing TURP . The primary outcome study hemodynamic variability technique . Secondary outcomes interest detection adverse event include early late neurological complication . Thus aim prospective randomize study compare efficacy continuous spinal anesthesia use Wiley spinal catheter continuous epidural anesthesia geriatric patient undergo TURP .</detailed_description>
