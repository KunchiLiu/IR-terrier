	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose radium-223 dichloride give patient osteosarcoma . Radium-223 chloride design work like radiation therapy cell actively make bone . It design target new bone growth around bone cancer may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Dose Escalation Monthly Intravenous Ra-223 Dichloride Osteosarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 3 group 3 participant enrol Phase I portion study , 6 participant enrol Phase II . If find eligible take part study , assign dose level radium-223 dichloride base join study . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose radium-223 dichloride find . If enrol Phase II portion , receive radium-223 dichloride high dose tolerate Phase I portion . Study Drug Administration : You receive radium-223 chloride vein several minute Day 1 4-week cycle . You drink plenty fluid study drug dose . You caregiver receive speak write instruction safety precaution receive drug . Study Visits : At study visit , ask drug may take side effect . On Day 1 Cycle 2-6 : - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign - You complete brief questionnaire pain may experience . This questionnaire take 5-10 minute complete . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - If become pregnant , urine blood pregnancy test . If doctor think need , also ultrasound check pregnancy . To take part study , pregnant . Within 1-3 week Cycle 3 : - You scan bone scan CT MRI scan check status disease . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . You may routine test do , include pregnancy test , study doctor think need . Length Study Drug Dosing : You may continue take study drug 6 cycle . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete end-of-dosing visit ( follow-up visit applicable ) . End-of-Dosing Visit : About 30 day last study drug dose : - You ask drug may take side effect . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign . - You complete brief questionnaire pain may experience . This questionnaire take 5-10 minute complete . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . - You scan bone scan CT MRI scan check status disease . Follow-Up Visits : If young 18 year old , height weight measure 1 time year turn 21 . These measurement may stop early height stay 2 year row . Information health status side effect ( especially relate bone ) collect report study staff every year . This investigational study . Radium-223 dichloride commercially available FDA approve treatment certain type prostate cancer . It currently use research purpose . Up 20 patient enrol study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
