	<brief_summary>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) 6th common cancer third frequent cause cancer death worldwide . Hepatic resection ( HR ) standard treatment modality HCC aim clinical cure . In Europe Unit States propose guideline HCC , HR recommend patient single HCC lesion preserve liver function . Unfortunately , 10 % -30 % HCCs amenable `` curative '' surgical resection time diagnosis , tumor multifocality , portal vein invasion , underlie advanced liver cirrhosis . Alternatively , transarterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) become popular modality palliative treatment patient . However , long term outcome generally poor HCC patient treat TACE . Recently , sorafenib show promise improvement 3-month survival among patient advanced HCC . It claim sorafenib become standard care patient advance HCC . Thus , purpose study prospectively compare effectiveness sorafenib combine TACE TACE alone treatment unresectable HCC .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Transcatheter Arterial Chemoembolization Combined With Sorafenib Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) common cause cancer mortality Asia . Most patient present intermediate advanced disease . Percutaneous ethanol injection , radiofrequency ablation , transcatheter arterial chemoembolization ( TACE ) consider curative treatment achieve limited success eradicate large HCC . Two phase III trial show efficacious well-tolerated patient advance HCC . Median overall survival significantly 2 3 month longer sorafenib group placebo . It interesting recognize combine therapeutic effect TACE sorafenib . The propose study make important contribution understand safety efficacy sorafenib addition TACE patient diagnose unresectable HCC , also first clinical trial prospectively compare effectiveness sorafenib combine TACE TACE alone treatment unresectable HCC</detailed_description>
