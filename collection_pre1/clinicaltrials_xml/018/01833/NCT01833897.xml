	<detailed_description>Bipolar disorder affect 2 % population United States depressive phase contribute disproportionally morbidity mortality . At present , approve treatment bipolar depression available , primarily depend manipulation brain monoaminergic system . In contrast , recent study suggest N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate-receptor ( NMDAR ) antagonist , ketamine , may provide near-immediate relief treatment resistant depression . Its utility long-term treatment , however , limited psychotomimetic potency need repeat IV infusion . D-cycloserine ( DCS ) approve oral antibiotic tuberculosis drug well-studied mixed agonist/antagonist NMDAR/glycine binding site . DCS show preliminary evidence efficacy pilot study . DCS would thus practical safety route administration perspective . The present study explore feasibility safety DCS maintenance treatment , measure magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) .</detailed_description>
