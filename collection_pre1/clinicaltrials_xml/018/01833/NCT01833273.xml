	<brief_summary>In order test investigator hypothesis 8 teaspoon POLYMVA safe population patient grade IV brain astrocytoma ( glioblastoma multiforme ) , investigator conduct open-label , prospective , un-blinded study . The investigator expect least 70 % subject tolerate supplement complete trial . The investigator expect Serious Adverse Event occur trial attributable study compound . During study , investigator also collect qualitative data utilized future double-blinded study aim determine whether grade IV astrocytoma patient receive PolyMVA achieve good quality life chemo-therapeutic regimen versus grade IV astrocytoma patient receive PolyMVA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This Phase I Safety Study investigate role PolyMVA supplement grade IV astrocytoma patient . The primary endpoint study safety/tolerability . This supplement , PolyMVA , uniquely formulate combination mineral , vitamin , amino acid . The principle ingredient Palladium Lipoic Acid Complex ( PdLA ) . There free alpha-lipoic acid free palladium Poly MVA ; bind together ( Garnett 1995 , Krishnan Garnett 2005 ) . PolyMVA water lipid soluble . It uniquely arrange liquid crystal polymer structure , allow store great deal energy , thus serve semi-conductor . The overall function polymer provide unified redox reaction ( accepts donates charge ) , act highly effective energy-transferring molecule . It able rapidly efficiently transfer electron charge DNA , protect non-cancerous cell oxidative damage radiation chemotherapy . Over past year neuroscientists institution use tissue culture technique study effect PolyMVA ( PdLA ) apoptotic cell death cascade cancer cell . The work predicate Nobel Prize win discovery Dr. Otto Warburg cancerous tumor oxygen deficient rely upon anaerobic metabolism energy production . Malignant cell thus adapt function hypoxic environment ; however , since anaerobic metabolism produce less energy per unit fuel , tumor cell less efficient energy production normal healthy cell . PolyMVA ( PdLA ) take advantage metabolic situation . PolyMVA ( PdLA ) , transfer excess electron malignant cell ( function limit oxygen environment ) , responsible selective generation free radical within mitochondrial membrane malignant cell . Free radical generation region facilitate cytochrome c release , activation apoptotic cascade , , ultimately , cancer cell death . Furthermore , electrochemistry data ischemia data institution elucidate shuttled electron go directly DNA , pas via mitochondrion . ( This route determine competitively block efficiency PolyMVA ( PdLA ) free alpha lipoic acid , work complex I mitochondria . ) Therefore , electron , en route DNA , shunt electron transport chain . The result : enhance cellular energy non-malignant cell . ( Clinically , process would benefit cancer patient , result toxic therapeutic regimen cancerous invasion , energy-depleted ; would also benefit normal healthy subject experience fatigue , , simply look energy boost . ) Poly MVA function energy-transferring molecule , also free radical scavenger ( able quench radical specie ) . It combination activity , may benefit cell expose ischemic condition . During ischemic insult , Poly MVA ability shuttle electron plasma cell membrane mitochondrion , thus stabilize vulnerable electron transfer chain . Additionally , liquid crystal polymer activity ability quench radical generate upon reperfusion . This non-toxic novel supplement may therefore serve potent anti-ischemia agent . Hypothesis : Eight teaspoon daily dosage PolyMVA grade IV astrocytoma patient safe well-tolerated .</detailed_description>
