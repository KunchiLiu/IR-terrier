	<brief_title>A Phase IV Post Approval Clinical Study ExAblate Treatment Metastatic Bone Tumors Palliation Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As part PMA # P110039 review process approval , InSightec request conduct post-approval study . Patients treat follow approved commercial treatment guideline . For study , participate site use ExAblate device administration ExAblate treatment . This study perform either 1.5T 3T MR scanner . For study , total 70 patient meet approved commercial guideline enrol treated ExAblate system 7 10 site . The proportion responder expect least 30 % great proportion subject experience pain progression ( i.e. , 60 % vs. 30 % ) . Additionally , 3 month visit , analysis safety efficacy profile compare original PMA pivotal study group .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Men woman age 18 old Patients able willing give consent able attend study visit Patients suffer symptom bone metastases multiple myeloma bone lesion : Patients receive radiation without adequate relief metastatic bone pain determine patient treat physician treating physician would prescribe radiation additional radiation treatment patient refuse additional radiation therapy . Patient NRS ( 010 scale ) pain score ≥ 4 irrespective medication Targeted bone/tumor interface ExAblate device accessible locate rib , extremity ( exclude joint ) , pelvis , shoulder posterior aspect follow spinal vertebra : Lumbar vertebra ( L3 L5 ) , Sacral vertebra ( S1 S5 ) Targeted bone/tumor interface ( painful lesion ) size 55 cm2 surface area Patient whose target ( treat ) lesion bone interface bone lesion deeper 10mm skin . Targeted ( treat ) tumor clearly visible noncontrast MRI , ExAblate MRgFUS device accessible Able communicate sensation ExAblate treatment Patients ongoing chemotherapy regimen time eligibility : 1. chemotherapy regime ( documented patient medical dossier ) , And 2 . Worst pain NRS still ≥ 4 And 3. NOT plan initiate new chemotherapy pain palliation eligible study . Note : Planned multiple course chemotherapy consider New Chemotherapy . No radiation therapy target ( painful ) lesion past two week Bisphosphonate intake remain stable throughout study duration . Patients 1 5 painful lesion painful lesion treat . Patients persistent distinguishable pain associate 1 site treat ( patient pain additional site , pain additional site must evaluate less intense least 2 point NRS compare site treat ) . Patients either Need surgical stabilization affect bony structure ( &gt; 7 fracture risk score , see Section 7.4 ) OR Targeted tumor impend fracture site ( &gt; 7 fracture risk score , see Section 7.4 ) . OR Patients surgical stabilization tumor site metallic hardware More 5 painful lesion , 1 require immediate localize treatment Targeted ( treat ) tumor skull Patients dialysis Patients life expectancy &lt; 3Months Patients acute medical condition ( e.g. , pneumonia , sepsis ) expect hinder complete study . Patients unstable cardiac status include : Unstable angina pectoris medication Patients document myocardial infarction within six month protocol entry Congestive heart failure require medication ( diuretic ) Patients antiarrhythmic drug Severe hypertension ( diastolic BP &gt; 100 medication ) Patients standard contraindication MR image nonMRI compatible implant metallic device include cardiac pacemaker , size limitation , etc . Patients active infection severe hematological , neurological , uncontrolled disease . Known intolerance allergy MRI contrast agent ( e.g . Gadolinium Magnevist ) include advanced kidney disease KPS Score &lt; 60 ( See `` Definitions '' ) Severe cerebrovascular disease ( multiple CVA CVA within 6 month ) Individuals able willing tolerate require prolong stationary position treatment ( approximately 2 hr . ) Target ( treat ) tumor le 1cm nerve bundle , bowel bladder . Are participate participate another clinical trial last 30 day Patients initiate new chemotherapy regime pain purpose , radiation ( target painful lesion ) within last 2 week Note : Planned multiple course chemotherapy consider New Chemotherapy . Patients unable communicate investigator staff . Patients persistent undistinguishable pain ( pain source unidentifiable target lesion ) Patient whose bonelesion interface &lt; 10mm skin Targeted ( painful ) tumor NOT visible noncontrast MRI , Targeted ( painful ) tumor Not accessible ExAblate The targeted tumor less 2 point painful compare painful lesion site specific NRS .</criteria>
