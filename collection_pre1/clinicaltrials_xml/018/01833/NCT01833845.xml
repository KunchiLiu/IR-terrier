	<brief_summary>Proof-of Concept , Open-Label , Two-Stage Study without Direct Individual Benefit The propose study design consist two treatment period one treatment arm . Treatment Period 1 involves administration RBV monotherapy period 8 week Treatment Period 2 involve administration 16 week combination therapy RBV plus HCQ .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy , Safety Tolerability Ribavirin Monotherapy Followed Combined Treatment With Ribavirin Hydroxychloroquine Patients Infected With Hepatitis C</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients provide inform consent conform inclusion none exclusion criterion enrol study receive RBV monotherapy 8 week . Subjects receive weight-based dos ( 1000 mg/day administer BID [ twice daily ] subject ≤ 75 kg 1200 mg/day administer BID subject &gt; 75 kg ) . Those subject receive 1000 mg/day RBV take 2 tablet 200 mg/tablet morning 3 tablet even , subject receive 1200 mg/day RBV take 3 tablet morning evening . During Treatment Period 2 , subject receive HCQ 575 mg administer single tablet daily ( QD ) , addition continue dose RBV administer Treatment Period 1 , combination therapy 16 week . Subjects undergo regular blood sample throughout Treatment Periods 1 2 measure viral response ( HCV RNA ) . Safety assess throughout study collection adverse event ( AE ) concomitant medication data , routine monitoring laboratory safety test , vital sign 12-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) . Subjects viral response test follow 12 week combination therapy ; show &lt; 1 log decline viral load combination therapy opportunity withdraw transfer standard care ( SoC ) treatment follow performance `` End Study Treatment '' visit . On completion study treatment , subject allow transfer immediately SoC treatment order maximize benefit reduce viral load result combination therapy RBV plus HCQ . Subjects attend clinical site `` End Study Treatment '' visit within 2 week final dose combination treatment RBV plus HCQ undergo final measurement HCV RNA , safety assessment describe full physical ophthalmic examination . The `` End Study Treatment '' visit may take place day final study visit week 24 . In event subject achieve viral undetectability combination therapy , relevant subject may administer additional combination therapy achieve total 24 week viral undetectability . If combination dose RBV plus HCQ continue 16 week , subject continue attend clinical site undergo assessment safety viral load discretion Investigator . However , treatment beyond 16 week combination therapy consider compassionate use consider part study . In subject , `` End Study Treatment '' visit take place 2 week Week 24 visit .</detailed_description>
