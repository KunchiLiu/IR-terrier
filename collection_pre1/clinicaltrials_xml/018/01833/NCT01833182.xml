	<brief_summary>Phase 1 study : Falls lead cause preventable injury , long term disability , premature institutionalization mortality old adult population . Promising preliminary research suggest modification home potentially reduce incidence fall elderly . The purpose study gather data necessary design definitive trial home modification intervention old adult risk fall . The specific aim 1 ) estimate efficacy intensive tailor environmental intervention reduce functional decline among community-dwelling older adult ; 2 ) gather data necessary design definitive clinical trial intensive tailor environmental intervention reduce cumulative incidence fall among community-dwelling older adult ; 3 ) examine direct cost intensive tailor home modification . A pilot randomize control trial conduct 40 old adult experience fall result emergency room visit . Phase 2 study : Our long-term objective prevent fall old adult high risk remove hazard home . Development effective intervention fall reduction could immediate impact population high public health significance . Intensive home hazard removal establish effective environmental intervention prevention fall ; however , none publish study conduct US , study adequately control bias . The investigator propose double-blinded , randomized sham-controlled clinical trial determine efficacy intensive tailor home hazard removal intervention reduce cumulative incidence fall among 110 community-dwelling old adult visit emergency department ( ED ) fall . This three year study first utilize sham control group double-blind , randomize study design . The investigator intervene high-risk group community-dwelling old adult visit ED fall . The primary hypothesis test compare 12-month cumulative incidence fall intensive tailor home intervention group fall sham control group . Falls operationalized unintentional movement floor , ground object knee level . The secondary hypothesis test compare total number fall , number injurious fall , fear fall performance daily activity intervention sham control group . The primary aim propose study : 1 . Compare efficacy intensive tailor home hazard reduction intervention sham treatment cumulative incidence fall 12 month old adult visit ED fall . Hypothesis 1 : The cumulative incidence fall 12 month low intensive tailor home hazard removal group compare sham control group . The secondary aim propose study : 2 . Determine intensive tailor home hazard reduction intervention superior sham treatment secondary outcome include : total number fall , number injurious fall , fear fall activity daily live ( ADL ) performance . Hypothesis 2 : The investigator hypothesize intensive tailor home hazard reduction intervention group experience few total fall , few injurious fall , less fear fall improved ADL performance compare sham control group . 3 . Characterize intensive tailor home hazard reduction intervention include frequency environmental modification type location home direct cost . The investigator also conduct subgroup analysis type , location cost home modification race gender . The propose study innovative provide intensive , individualized prescription home hazard removal provide quick response fall . It also first double-blind trial effect environmental modification fall , knowledge , first collaboration occupational therapy emergency medicine fall reduction strategy US . The result propose study provide new evidence effectiveness intensive tailor home hazard removal reduce fall . This study potential provide public health guideline delivery home hazard removal , decrease health care cost associate fall provide evidence guide public health policy old adult fall .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>One intervention prove successful improve ADL performance provide environmental support home modification . By use environmental support compensate intrinsic limitation population experience , ADL instrumental ADL ( IADL ) performance maximize . In study fall cause , environmental feature often identify important contribute factor . It possible home modification could effective intervention strategy reduce functional decline , fear fall , incidence fall among old adult ADL/IADL dysfunction . The consequence fall elderly serious public health concern . Older adult visit ED result fall discharge home represent underserved group great risk future fall . The model screen old adult risk recurrent fall ED initiate intervention potentially cost-effective strategy broad public health implication . Intensive home modification appeal intervention , high adherence rate efficacy improve ADL performance reduce rate fall . There need study home modification . We conduct blind , randomize , sham-controlled pilot trial estimate efficacy intensive tailor environmental intervention reduce functional decline among community-dwelling old adult visit ED fall . We also gather data necessary design definitive double-blinded , randomize , sham-controlled clinical trial determine efficacy intensive tailor environmental intervention reduce cumulative incidence fall population . Older adult visit ED contact emergency medical service ( EMS ) result fall home randomly assign sham-control intervention group . The intervention deliver via standardize tailor protocol . Blinded assessment conducted participant ' performance intervention , 6 month intervention , 12 month intervention . Participants blind treatment group assignment . Upon intervention completion , monitor ADL status fall monthly 12 month determine effect intervention time . Study participants raters blind randomization assignment . The outcome study mask improvement ADL status . This study conduct two phase . Consent enrollment , evaluation , intervention , follow-up procedure phase study . The measure use phase study .</detailed_description>
