	<brief_summary>An early efficient enteral nutritional support could improve clinical outcome brain injure critically ill patient . Gastrointestinal feed intolerance define increase gastric residual volume frequently occur patient . Previous experimental study suggest small-peptide enteral feeding formula could promote gastric empty compare whole-protein formula . An improved gastrointestinal tolerance enteral nutrition allow rapid increase daily caloric intake enhance nutritional support brain injure critically ill patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficiency Small-peptide Enteral Feeding Formula Compared Whole-protein Formula</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-labelled prospective randomize trial aim compare 2 group patient : Study Group Control Group . The randomization process concern allocation type enteral feed formula administer nutritional support : Peptamen® AF Study Group , Sondalis® HP Control Group . 2 center involve study . Each patient admit critical care unit assess eligibility . After write informed consent obtain relative , patient without exclusion criterion include study . The allocation type enteral nutritional feeding formula randomize inclusion . Enteral nutrition accord randomization group start within 48 hour admission 10 day , request . Beyond 10th day , patient receive standard enteral nutrition formula . After inclusion , data regard efficacy tolerance assess daily day 10 . Mortality outcome assess day 28 day 60 .</detailed_description>
