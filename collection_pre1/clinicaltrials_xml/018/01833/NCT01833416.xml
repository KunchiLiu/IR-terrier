	<brief_summary>Although accumulate knowledge regard Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) infection increase substantially past year , several issue still deserve investigation . The epidemiology disease changing , perhaps influence new immunosuppressive strategy currently use grow widespread use prophylaxis . The knowledge CMV viral load kinetics , use polymerase chain reaction ( PCR-based assay ) , among renal transplant recipient receive prophylactic therapy allow determination risk factor impact early intervention CMV infection disease . The goal ultimately improve clinical outcome renal transplant recipient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Natural History Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) Infection Disease Among Renal Transplant Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) infection remain one common complication affect organ transplant recipient , significant morbidity occasional mortality . The adverse impact CMV infection graft function underscore importance CMV transplant outcome . CMV prevention strategy result significant reduction CMV disease CMV-related mortality . The reduction incidence `` indirect effect '' CMV infection also attribute use CMV prevention . Nevertheless , management CMV infection varies considerably among transplant center . Two major strategy commonly use prevention CMV : universal prophylaxis preemptive therapy . Within strategy , significant variation clinical practice exists , include type cellular molecular diagnostics , antiviral therapy , monitor criterion stop treatment . Although use universal prophylaxis increase since availability valganciclovir , still debate regard superiority strategy preemptive approach . Furthermore , costly therapy CMV prophylaxis currently reimburse unify public health system . Therefore strategy use preemptive therapy . Additionally , consider different immunosuppressive regimen accord pretransplant stratified evaluation risk rejection , kidney transplant recipient high risk develop CMV infection disease , i.e. , negative recipient positive organ donor , patient receive induction therapy thymoglobulin patient treat acute rejection undergo preemptive strategy . Using strategy , currently overall incidence CMV infection disease currently 25 % . This incidence high among recipient receive thymoglobulin induction , tacrolimus mycophenolate maintenance combination treatment acute rejection either high dose corticosteroid thymoglobulin . Because none kidney transplant recipient institution receive prophylaxis CMV infection immunosuppressive regimen select accord immunological rejection risk , ideal population investigate natural history CMV infection disease use recent , sensitive specific molecular toll .</detailed_description>
