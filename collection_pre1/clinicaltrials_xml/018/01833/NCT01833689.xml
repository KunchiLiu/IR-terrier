	<detailed_description>The study randomize cross-over control trial : order test food randomize independent internet-based program ; participant ask consume product ; test food compare control ( case 50g glucose ) . Suitable subject invite screen visit check eligibility criterion . Body weight height measurement take well standard biochemical haematological screen . If eligible willing take part , volunteer enter database contact GI test become available . Volunteers may take part one GI test maximum 40 visit per year . Volunteers may withdraw database study time without give reason . Subjects ask come set amount visit GI test depend number product need test ( minimum 3 maximum 12 visit test ) . The volunteer inform number visit enter GI testing . For visit , subject test morning 10-12h overnight fast . Three fast blood sample take ( -5 , -3 , -1 ) 2 minute apart subject consume test meal reference food even rate 15 min . All subject ask record time take minute consume test food/reference . Further blood sample take 15 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 45 , 60 , 90 120 min begin meal . The test meal reference food consume 250ml drink water . This remain constant test series . Blood obtain finger-pricking use disposable Unistix needle . In previous study , capillary blood yield less between-subject variation GI . Instant glucose analyser use .</detailed_description>
