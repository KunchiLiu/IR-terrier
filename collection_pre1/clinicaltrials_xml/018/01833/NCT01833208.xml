	<brief_title>Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Hormone-Resistant Prostate Cancer Receiving Sipuleucel-T</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess whether radiation therapy ( RT ) increase immunogenic potential sipuleucel-T participant castration recurrent prostate cancer . II . To assess systemic change immune system genetic change immune cell participant treat combination RT sipuleucel-T. III . To assess induction antigen-specific immune response prostatic acid phosphatase ( PAP ) , cancer/testis antigen 1B ( NY-ESO-1 ) antigens proven release radiation ( , heat shock protein 90 [ HSP-90 ] , calreticulin , etc. ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess adverse event rate participant receive high-dose radiation sipuleucel-T therapy . II . To assess prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) change . III . To assess overall cancer specific survival . OUTLINE : Patients undergo single-fraction radiation therapy least 1 bone lesion 2 day first sipuleucel-T dose . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 6 month annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
