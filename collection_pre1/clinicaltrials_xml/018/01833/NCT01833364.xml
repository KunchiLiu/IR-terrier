If successful , would promote development new treatment PD patient able provide tissue source supportive environment injure die cell thereby possibly stop progression illness even improve symptom PD . The purpose research gather information safety feasibility nerve graft implantation . The result study share University Kentucky , Center Clinical Translational Science ( group provide financial support study ) federal agency , require . The overall goal research develop novel , regenerative treatment strategy idiopathic Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) safe , cost effective widely available patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Autologous Peripheral Nerve Grafts Into Substantia Nigra Subjects With PD Undergoing Deep Brain Stimulation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This pilot study design test safety feasibility implantation subject 's peripheral nerve tissue area brain call substantia nigra . Only subject elect undergo DBS surgery ask participate research study . The implantation nerve graft take place operating room end second stage surgery DBS . Subjects ask donate piece peripheral nerve tissue use create graft implantation . The peripheral nerve tissue obtain small incision ( approximately 2 inch ) outer-side one ankle . The initial incision create stage I DBS procedure take place general anesthesia . The incision close internal suture , dress cover incision procedure . The nerve harvest stage II DBS procedure . This involve open incision use local anesthesia inject around incision site . Once small piece ( inch ) nerve remove , incision suture close internal stitch . These stitch dissolve need remove office . Follow-up . Subjects follow clinic DBS follow-up visit treatment , none visit part study . Prior come study visit subject need stop take PD medication 12 hour visit . Subjects allow restart normal PD medication examination . Subjects undergo formal Unified Parkinson 's Disease Rating Scale ( UPDRS ) evaluation screen month 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 12 . In order visually document potential change Parkinson 's Disease symptoms follow DBS surgery , videotape study related neurological testing session . Subject also videotape screen , visit 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 . A neuropsychological exam perform screen month 12 .</detailed_description>
