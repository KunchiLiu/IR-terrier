	<brief_summary>This 3-arm , parallel-group , active- placebo-controlled , double-blind , randomized study , compare treatment intravenous custirsen 640 mg ( high intend therapeutic dose ) placebo . The purpose study assess effect custirsen treatment cardiac conduction repolarization ( electrical activity heart ) healthy subject . The positive control employ demonstrate assay sensitivity consist group receive single oral dose 400 mg moxifloxacin day 7 . The moxifloxacin arm un-blinded ECG reading blind .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Thorough QT/QTc ( Corrected QT Interval ) Study Evaluate Effect Custirsen Cardiac Repolarization</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effect custirsen evaluate follow administration single dose follow dose-titration period combine dexamethasone pretreatment . On day −1 7 , subject undergo full ECG assessment 24 hour . On day 1 , randomization assignment treatment group perform prior drug administration . Subjects remain study center throughout treatment period . All subject discharge end day 8 procedure , 24 hour last dose custirsen administer . Subjects group 1 2 return additional visit day 9 , 10 14 ( ±2 day ) ( approximately 7 day last study drug administration ) . Subjects group 3 return follow-up visit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . The subject man age 18 45 year age body mass index ( BMI ) 18 30 kg/m2 screening . 2 . The subject good health determine medical history , ECG , vital sign measurement , physical examination , clinical laboratory test . 3 . The subject must able understand comply requirement study ( eg , medication , dietary , exercise , tobacco , alcohol restriction ) . 4 . The subject must provide write informed consent participate study read information consent form , opportunity discus study investigator delegate . 5 . Other inclusion criterion apply . 1 . Exclusion criterion relate ECG finding include follow : The subject ECG abnormality may interfere accurate assessment QT interval , include intraventricular conduction delay ( QRS &gt; 120 msec PR &gt; 200 measure screen checkin visit ) complete incomplete bundle branch block . The subject resting QTcF interval ≤360 msec and/or ≥450 msec measure screening day 2 . 2 . Exclusion criterion related cardiac function include follow : The subject know clinically significant ( opinion investigator ) cardiovascular disorder , include coronary artery disease , valvular heart disease , cardiomyopathy , ECG abnormality suggestive prior myocardial infarction , angina pectoris , chamber enlargement , hypertrophy . Notwithstanding , subject know significant disorder exclude . The subject know clinically significant arrhythmia rhythm disturbance observe screening and/or day 2 12lead ECG . The subject supine pulse rate outside range 40 100 bpm ( follow least 10minute rest ) measure screen day 2 . The subject supine blood pressure outside range 90 139 mm Hg systolic 50 89 mm Hg diastolic ( follow least 10minute rest ) measure screen day 2 . Note : The blood pressure measurement may repeat 3 time meet eligibility requirement . In case , average 3 measurement must meet eligibility criterion . The subject report history , risk factor , Torsades de Pointes ( eg , congestive heart failure , serum electrolyte abnormality ) include family history arrhythmia , sudden unexplained death young age ( 40 year ) firstdegree relative , long QT syndrome , personal history syncope . 3 . The subject low serum potassium and/or magnesium and/or correct calcium blood level ( less 3.5 milliequivalent/liter ( mEq/L ) , 1.8 mEq/L , 8.9 mg/dL , respectively ) screen and/or day2 . 4 . The subject condition may possibly interfere drug absorption , distribution , metabolism , excretion ( eg , previous surgery gastrointestinal tract [ include removal part stomach , bowel , liver , gall bladder , pancreas ] stomach band ) . 5 . The subject abnormality medical history , physical examination , biochemistry , hematology , coagulation , serology , urinalysis screen admission visit consider clinically significant investigator meet grade 24 Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) v.4 criterion , opinion investigator , could interfere objective study safety subject . Notwithstanding , follow value must remain within normal range value ( determined Physician Reference Laboratory [ PRL ] ) order subject eligible study : calcium , magnesium , potassium , creatinine , ALT , AST , GGT , hemoglobin , absolute lymphocyte count , absolute 50 mg/dL asymptomatic subject absolute leukocyte count value low 3.1x109/L African American subject consider enrollment investigator 's discretion . Lastly , upper limit value exclusion modify follow value follow : INR &gt; 1.2 , total bilirubin &gt; 1.2 mg/dL , serum amylase &gt; 143 U/L , LDH &gt; 261 U/L , CPK &gt; 367 U/L , normalize upon repeat testing , exclusionary . 6 . The subject use one prohibit drug , substance food follow : investigational product within 60 day ( 5 halflives , whichever long ) precede study prescription nonprescription medication ( include herbal remedy , vitamin , dietary supplement ) vaccine within 14 day first day study drug administration ( day 1 ) within 5 halflives first day study drug administration , whichever longer . Exceptions locally act medication ( eg , topical cream ) , allow within 5 day study drug administration , occasional use acetaminophen ( 3 g/day ) ibuprofen ( 1200 mg/day ) . consumption grapefruit , grapefruit juice , Seville oranges , pomelocontaining product , within 14 day prior day 1 throughout entire study consumption excessive amount alcoholic beverage , define 3 drink per day ( beer , wine , distilled spirit ) , unwillingness comply restrict use alcohol study ( 96 hour prior admission 48 hour last study drug administration ) , history alcoholism , evidence drug/chemical abuse positive urine drug ( cocaine , amphetamine , barbiturate , opiate , phencyclidine , benzodiazepine , tetrahydrocannabinol ) , cotinine , alcohol screen screen visit admission consumption quinine ( eg , tonic water ) within 7 day prior admission 7 .
