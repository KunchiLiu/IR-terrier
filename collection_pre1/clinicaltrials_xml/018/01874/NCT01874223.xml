	<brief_summary>The purpose study test cough , dyspnea ( shortness breath ) , quality life ( QOL ) questionnaires accuracy , sensitivity , ability reliably measure severity cough , breathlessness , change cough disease-related quality life time Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF ) patient . These questionnaire use type disease , test validated patient cough due IPF . Our hypothesis worsening cough , dyspnea , cough-related QOL questionnaire score correlate physiologic marker IPF severity worsen disease . Written , valid questionnaire measure cough , dyspnea , QOL important ass benefit investigational drug development treat patient IPF .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Validation Cough , Dyspnea , Quality Life Questionnaires Patients With Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis ( IPF )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study patient IPF determine validity , responsiveness , reliability two cough measure ( Leicester Cough Questionnaire ( LCQ ) , well Visual Analogue Scales ( VASs ) cough severity distress ; one dyspnea measure ( Baseline Transition Dyspnea Index ( BDI/TDI ) ; two health-related quality life ( HRQL ) measure ( obstructive lung disease-specific Saint George 's Respiratory Questionnaire ( SGRQ ) IPF-specific ' A Tool Assess QOL IPF ' ( ATAQ-IPF ) . Both SGRQ ATAQ include cough question . Study participant complete questionnaire baseline , 6 , 12 , 18 month time usual clinic visit . Physiologic data collect time visit include pulmonary function testing , exercise oxygen saturation , change medication health status . Changes cough , dyspnea QOL score correlate concurrent change physiologic marker IPF severity . If study participant acute worsening IPF , undergoes lung transplantation , study questionnaire may give additional timepoints possible .</detailed_description>
