	<brief_title>Effects SQ109 QTc Interval Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 , randomize , single-center , clinical study SQ109 evaluate potential drug produce QTc prolongation . The study population healthy male female subject , age 18-45 year . Pharmacokinetics SQ109 measure use interval plasma samples.The overall study design incorporate within four-period investigation suitable QT evaluation active study treatment . The primary goal sample size consideration ensure sample size employ phase study adequate ensure high likelihood successful demonstration QT safety 300 450 mg/day SQ109 . All subject randomize sequence three seven-day dose period , dose period occur per subject . The final seven-day dosing period occur first sequence three dose period complete . A washout period least seven day occur dose period , follow-up visit occur .</detailed_description>
