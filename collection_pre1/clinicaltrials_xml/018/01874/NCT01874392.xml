	<brief_summary>This clinical trial feasibility study assess performance Artificial Pancreas ( AP ) device use Artificial Pancreas System ( APS© ) platform subject type 1 diabetes use rapid-acting insulin well preprandial inhale insulin ( Technosphere® Insulin Inhalation System MannKind Corporation ) . The goal propose study explore feasibility use multiple insulin delivery rout order mimic physiology first- second-phase insulin secretion . The intent exploit rapid action achieve inhaled insulin compensate part meal utilize conventional subcutaneous route management basal insulin second-phase meal-related insulin .</brief_summary>
