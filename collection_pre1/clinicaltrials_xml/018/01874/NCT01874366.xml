	<detailed_description>- In Part I , safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacodynamics ( PD ) single ascend dos P11187 study healthy , overweight obese , male female ( non-child bearing potential ) subject . There 6 cohort 8 subject . At dose level , 6 subject receive single dose active treatment , P11187 2 subject receive single dose match placebo . It plan 6 dose level P11187 may evaluate single dose administration . - In Part II , safety , tolerability , PK PD multiple ascending dos P11187 administer daily 14 consecutive day study overweight obese , male female non-child bearing potential subject type 2 diabetes mellitus . Up 3 dose level P11187 plan evaluate 3 cohort 12 subject 14 days.At dose level , 9 subject receive active drug , P11187 3 subject receive match placebo , daily period 14 day . - In Part III , food effect evaluation P11187 perform randomize , open-label , cross-over , two-period study single dose level cohort 12 healthy male subject administer drug fast fed conditions.Subjects administer single dose P11187 Periods 1 2 fasted fed condition per randomization schedule , wash-out interval 7-10 day two period . Subjects receive study drug , P11187 fast condition Period 1 cross-over receive study drug feed condition Period 2 vice versa .</detailed_description>
