	<brief_summary>The major goal project conduct randomize , control trial impact practical , low cost physical activity intervention fatigue among person rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) . Fatigue identify major concern individual RA , consider core outcome measure RA . Our recent study source fatigue identify physical inactivity primary predictor fatigue . Studies examine impact exercise intervention RA outcome , intervention focus pain function outcome . The exercise study examine fatigue suggest increase physical activity reduces fatigue , intervention resource-intensive , require specially train personnel administer , highly structured activity , and/or attendance class specify facility . Each component increase cost barrier implementation intervention . Pedometers show effective mean increase physical activity , could form basis simple mean increase physical activity . This project test effect simple pedometer-based intervention , two incremental degree guidance , increase physical activity decrease fatigue . Three group ( n=40 ) study : control group educational pamphlet , pedometer-only intervention group , pedometer group step target . Both intervention group keep step-count diary . Groups follow 20 week . We expect ( 1 ) pedometer-only intervention group increase activity education group , group step-count target demonstrate even great increase activity ; ( 2 ) great increase activity associate great decrease fatigue . Secondary outcome measure include depressive symptom , self-reported sleep quality , body composition . Our overall goal demonstrate effective , yet simple low cost , physical activity intervention decrease fatigue could broadly accessible potential wide implementation .</brief_summary>
