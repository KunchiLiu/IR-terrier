	<brief_summary>The US EPA Clean Air Multiyear research program move toward multi-pollutant approach assessment air pollution response recommendation NRC 2004 BOSC 2005 . Such approach well reflect complexity real-world air pollution problem parallel evolve scientific regulatory consideration . Ozone ( O3 ) diesel exhaust ( DE ) generally major important component ambient air pollution . This propose study address agency 's goal investigate cardiopulmonary health effect healthy human subject co-exposed O3 DE . The finding derive exposure provide NCEA finding risk assessment O3 DE , well Office Air Radiation ( include OTAQ OAQPS ) information relevant possible modulation PM-induced health effect responses gaseous co-pollutant potential standard setting . Additionally findings address fundamental drive principle Clean Air Research strategy relate reduction health due air pollutant exposure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cardiopulmonary Responses Exposure Ozone Diesel Exhaust</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Numerous epidemiological study demonstrate association acute chronic exposure air pollution various adverse cardiopulmonary effect include mortality , respiratory tract infection , exacerbation asthma symptom , chronic bronchitis , ischemic heart disease , stroke [ 1 ] health effect . Understanding component responsible effect difficult ambient air pollution complex mixture gas particulate matter ( PM ) . In complex mixture ambient air pollution , ozone ( O3 ) diesel exhaust ( DE ) generally major important component . Controlled exposure volunteer either pollutant result biological effect lung physiological change . However know co-exposure pollutant , similar pollute ambient air , induce additive synergistic effect . Additionally also uncertain exposure DE , DE O3 , alter subsequent exposure O3 similar multiple day exposures general population receive . This study propose examine whether co-exposures O3 DE induce additive synergistic effect , whether previous DE exposure alters response upon subsequent exposure O3 . The potential effect O3 cardiac electrophysiology also clear . Approximately 15 healthy non-smoking volunteer age 18 55 expose controlled manner O3 ( approximately mean concentration 0.3 ppm 2 hr exposure period ) , diesel exhaust ( DE ; ~300 Âµg/m3 ) , combine O3 DE exposure undergo moderate intermittent exercise EPA Human Studies Facility . A clean air exposure serve control . Primary endpoint evaluate health effect surrogate response change lung function heart rate variability . In addition , cardiopulmonary vascular biological endpoint measure , well marker exposure genetic marker susceptibility .</detailed_description>
