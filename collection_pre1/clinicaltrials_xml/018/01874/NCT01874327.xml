	<detailed_description>The propose intervention adapt parent-mediated intervention successfully improve outcomes toddler autism . The intervention model ( ) target foundation social-communication ( joint attention , imitation , play ) , ( b ) use naturalistic strategy increase rate complexity social-communication ( c ) include parent implementers intervention promote generalization across setting activity ensure maintenance time . In addition test primary effect early intervention developmental outcomes child sign autism , examine whether method superior early intervention focus global infant development . Because brain development occur rapidly infant toddler , use high density EEG investigate ( 1 ) biomarkers change infant result intervention ( 2 ) biomarkers predict response treatment , focus neural correlate social attention learn joint engagement . Study Aims : AIM 1 : To examine effect experimental intervention ( Baby JASPER ) primary ( joint attention ) secondary outcome ( receptive language , play , symbol-infused joint engagement parent use social communication support strategy ) . AIM 2 : To examine maintenance generalization effect experimental intervention child parent . AIM 3 : To examine electrophysiological biomarkers change treatment well predictor social communication outcome child intervention . AIM 4 ( exploratory ) : To examine effect potential child level parent level moderator primary secondary outcome study across two condition .</detailed_description>
