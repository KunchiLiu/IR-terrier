	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate effectiveness intravenous fosaprepitant therapy reduce nausea vomit treatment high dose interleukin-2 ( HD IL-2 ) therapy metastatic melanoma metastatic renal cell carcinoma . Fosaprepitant intravenous ( IV ) medication FDA- approve use adult prevention nausea vomit chemotherapy . Fosaprepitant work block neurokinin-1 receptor , receptor brain know cause nausea vomit . Past study estimate 70 % patient undergoing treatment HD IL-2 nausea and/or vomit . While fosaprepitant use clinical practice treat nausea vomit HD IL-2 , study do see well work . All patient receive treatment ( IV fosaprepitant ) study either first second hospital admission HD IL-2 . On admission subject receive IV fosaprepitant , subject receive placebo ( medicine look like fosaprepitant , active ) . The study double-blinded , mean neither subject , study doctor know group assign admission ( IV fosaprepitant placebo ) . This study design choose limit potential bias , mean trial design try ensure unknown factor affect trial result . When patient start study , patient randomly assign one two group : receive treatment ( IV fosaprepitant ) first receive placebo first . During first admission , subject give IV fosaprepitant IV placebo admission . During second admission , subject 'crossover ' receive treatment receive first admission . Improvement nausea vomit assess count number nausea vomit episode , record subject need additional medication nausea vomiting , use patient questionnaire .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fosaprepitant Nausea Vomiting During High-dose Interleukin-2 ( HD IL-2 ) Metastatic Melanoma Renal Cell Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 2B double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study evaluate efficacy intravenous fosaprepitant chemotherapy-induced nausea vomit patient undergo high-dose interleukin-2 ( HD IL-2 ) therapy ( 720,000 IU/kg per dose intravenously ; 14 dos , 2 cycle per course ) metastatic melanoma metastatic renal cell carcinoma . A total 22 subject enrol study . On study entry , patient randomize receive either IV fosaprepitant ( 150 mg Day 1 , Day 3 , Day 5 ) match placebo first admission HD IL-2 therapy ( cycle 1 ) . All subject crossover receive opposite treatment cycle 2 . All patient receive ondansetron 24 mg mouth daily per standard protocol every 24 hour Days 1-5 admission start 30 minute prior first dose HD IL-2 . During treatment phase , subject receive Patients receive IV fosaprepitant 30 minute first dose HD IL-2 therapy every 48 hour completion HD IL-2 therapy . Upon study entry , subject give dairy report episode vomit , use rescue therapy , nausea assessment use 1-100 scale within visual analogue scale ( VAS ) . The subject instruct complete entry baseline assessment ( prior first dose ) 5 day last dose HD IL-2 endpoint analysis . During inpatient admission , subject complete diary entry dose ( q8 hour ) . As outpatient , subject complete diary entry daily basis . Recording whether pruritus observe also collect within subject diary . If patient report pruritus , severity pruritus 1-100 scale visual analogue scale ( VAS ) also collect . The study team record episodes vomit use rescue therapy ensure completion patient diary inpatient portion . Assessments make via telephone contact determine onset episode CINV outpatient portion . Safety assessment include adverse event ( AEs ) monitoring perform assessed use Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 .</detailed_description>
