	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease associate accumulation various metabolite , i.e. , uremic retention solute . Evidence mount colonic microbiome contributes substantially uremic retention solute . Indoxyl sulfate p-cresyl sulfate among extensively study gut microbial metabolite , associate cardiovascular disease , chronic kidney disease progression overall mortality . Indirect finding suggest chronic kidney disease influence colonic microbial metabolism high p-cresyl sulfate urinary excretion rate advance renal disease . Therefore , study aim elucidate influence renal dysfunction microbial metabolism test hypothesis chronic kidney disease patient carry different fecal metabolite profile .</brief_summary>
