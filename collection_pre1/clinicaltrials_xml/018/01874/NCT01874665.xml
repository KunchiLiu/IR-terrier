	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Trial Ponatinib Patients With Metastatic and/or Unresectable Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This non-randomized , open label , multi-center phase 2 study evaluate efficacy safety ponatinib patient metastatic and/or unresectable GIST failure prior TKI therapy . Patients whose tumor activate mutation exon 11 cellular KIT ( KIT ) enrol Cohort A . Patients whose tumor activate mutation enrol Cohort B . The primary objective ass clinical benefit patient KIT exon 11-mutant GIST ( Cohort A ) define clinical benefit rate ( CBR ) , composite complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) stable disease ( SD ) last ≥16 week per modify response evaluation criterion solid tumor ( RECIST 1.1 ) measure disease control . The secondary objective ass clinical benefit patient GIST lack activate KIT exon 11 mutation ( Cohort B ) total patient population . The efficacy assessment tumor response use Response Criteria Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) Version 1.1 , modify GIST assessment progression-free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . The safety assessment include routine physical laboratory evaluation , electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , echocardiogram ( ECHOs ) , adverse event ( AE ) monitoring . Other assessment include optional 18F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( FDG-PET ) ; optional pre- post-treatment tumor biopsy pharmacodynamic study ; pharmacokinetics ( PK ) . It estimate accrual complete within 1 year ; total estimate duration study 3 year .</detailed_description>
