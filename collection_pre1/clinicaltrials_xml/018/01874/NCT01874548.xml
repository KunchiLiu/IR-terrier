	<brief_summary>The purpose study : ( 1 ) develop magnetic resonance ( MR ) image spectroscopy surrogate biomarkers alter cancer metabolism cervical cancer ; ( 2 ) understand function human papillomavirus ( HPV ) infection autophagy ( cellular catabolic degradation response stress ) metabolic alteration cervical cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MR Metabolic Biomarkers Cervical Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In first part project , aim identify difference cancer metabolism normal cervical cancer . Conventional MR study plus magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( MRS ) diffusion weight imaging ( DWI ) sequence carry 30 eligible surgical candidate pretreatment clinical assessment . Metabolites cancer tissue collect operation analyze use high resolution MRS , compare control group comprise 30 patient normal cervical tissue . The primary endpoint part identify different MRS profile normal cancer subject . We investigate underlying biological mechanism two group evaluate status HPV infection autophagy . In second part , aim understand cancer metabolism cervical cancer infect different type HPV . We plan enroll another 30 surgical candidate complete data regard clinical MRS/DWI tissue high resolution MRS . Together 30 cancer subject part one total 60 cancer subject analysis . The primary endpoint part compare MRS profile cancer tissue infect different HPV genotype , particularly HPV type 16 HPV type 18 . The secondary endpoint correlate tissue MRS profile vivo MRS/DWI measure clinical MR scanner . In third part project , aim investigate cancer metabolism combine chemoradiation therapy ( CCRT ) . We plan enroll 60 patient primarily treat CCRT collect data use clinical MR tissue high-resolution MRS. Tissue MRS profile correlate HPV , E6/E7 autophagy . The advance knowledge project unwire complex relationship among cancer metabolism , HPV infection autophagy cervical cancer . The clinical impact development MR biomarkers cancer metabolism autophagy , play important role resistance cancer therapy . The inherited non-invasiveness non-radiation nature make MR technique ideal platform clinical usage .</detailed_description>
