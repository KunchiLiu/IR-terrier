	<brief_summary>The primary objective application determine selective ERβ agonist LY500307 , add antipsychotic medication , improves negative and/or cognitive symptom patient schizophrenia . The specific hypothesis test determine LY500307 safe well tolerate population whether elicits sufficient efficacy signal advance test schizophrenia . A two-stage Phase 1b/Phase 2a adaptive ( `` drop inferior dose '' ) experimental design ongoing combine three study ( clinical dose optimization , cortical target engagement confirmation efficacy safety assessment ) single clinical trial . Stage 1 conduct year 1 Stage 2 conduct year 2 3 . The goal Stage 1 identify advance high dose demonstrate safety signal target selectivity determine lack TT suppression . This criterion fulfil dos , large two ( 75 mg/day dose ) advance Stage 2 . Furthermore , suggestion ERα receptor activation ( i.e. , pattern TT decrease feminization AEs ) either dose ( 25 mg/day 75 mg/day ) . A third arm 150 mg/day add Stage 2 evaluation . Stage 2 result follow three arm : placebo , 75 mg/day 150 mg/day . The goal Stage 2 ass LY500307 dose safety target selectivity , confirm cortical target engagement assess efficacy . Primary Aim 1 : To determine LY500307 demonstrate cortical target engagement assess fMRI/N-back frontal-parietal region . Secondary measure target engagement fMRI episodic memory , Pseudo-Continuous Arterial Spin Labeling , Mismatch Negativity/evoked response potential , Auditory Steady State Response , Auditory P300 Quantitative EEG ( QEEG ) . Primary Aim 2 : To determine LY500307 superior placebo one primary efficacy endpoint : negative symptom ( Negative Symptom Assessment Scale - 16-item total score ) , work memory ( composite score Letter Number Sequencing Spatial Span test ) verbal memory ( Hopkins Verbal Learning Test ) . Primary Aim 3 : To determine LY500307 reduces total testosterone ( TT ) plasma concentration , indicative loss selectivity ERβ engagement ERα , use follow criterion : Decrease TT plasma concentration 50 % baseline 50 % subject per arm treat two consecutive post-randomization value LY500307 Stage 1 Stage 2 trial . Primary Aim 4 : To assess safety LY500307 determine SAEs , AEs `` probably related study drug , '' QTc prolongation , TT suppression ( 50 % reduction baseline ) evaluate safety signal . Secondary aim ass LY500307 effect regional brain activation connectivity work ( 2-Back visual-verbal work memory task ) episodic ( scene encode recognition ) memory task , evaluate electrophysiological index auditory sensory processing work memory ( auditory steady state response , mismatch negativity ( MMN ) auditory P300 ) . It predict LY500307 produce great increase placebo brain activity prefrontal cortex hippocampus work memory episodic memory task , respectively , connectivity rest fMRI , well increase power auditory steady state response , MMN amplitude P300 amplitude . The fMRI electrophysiological measure provide evidence target engagement LY500307 schizophrenia assess potential biomarkers future clinical trial . Additional secondary aim include assess effect LY500307 safety , positive symptom , depression , social functioning quality life .</brief_summary>
