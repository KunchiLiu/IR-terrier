	<brief_summary>PURPOSE : The long-term goal line research develop rational , biologically base evidence treatment post-concussion syndrome ( PCS ) child . The objective application examine effect melatonin symptom PCS neurobiology use integrate neurodiagnostic technique child . OVERVIEW : PCS constellation clinical symptom include physical ( i.e . headache ) , cognitive ( i.e . memory ) , behavioral disturbance . PCS associate significant morbidity child his/her family ) , yet evidence-based medical treatment available . This suggest urgent need develop novel treatment option improve outcomes child suffer PCS . Melatonin several relevant mechanism action , neuroprotective effect . Recent research suggest explanation persistent PCS symptom may due alteration neurotransmissions neuronal circuitry , particularly involve dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) . Investigators two specific aim : 1 . To determine treatment melatonin improve PCS child follow mild traumatic brain injury . Hypothesis : treatment mTBI child PCS 3mg 10mg oral melatonin 28 day result decrease PCS symptom compare placebo . Effects dose-dependent may independent sleep effect . Methods : A randomized double blind , placebo control trial ( RCT ) ; Outcome measure PCS symptom questionnaire . A subsequent RCT perform use optimal melatonin dose second centre . 2 . To understand neurophysiological mechanism paediatric PCS ass resultant effect treatment melatonin . Methods : A case-controlled study within RCT , use functional MRI Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation investigate neurophysiological property paediatric mTBI treatment ; Treatment group RCT compare two control group : ) normal control ii ) asymptomatic mTBI child . SIGNIFICANCE : This study potential 1 ) provide safe effective treatment PCS 2 ) provide valuable information neurophysiological property brain associate PCS follow mTBI child change symptom resolution .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We hypothesize treatment child PCS follow mTBI 3mg 10mg Melatonin 28 day result decrease PCS symptom compare placebo . Primary research question : Does treatment child PCS symptom follow mTBI 3mg sublingual Melatonin 10mg sublingual Melatonin 28 day result decrease PCS ( physical , cognitive behavioural ) symptom compare placebo ? Secondary research question : Is dose-response relationship ? Is treatment effect independent effect sleep ? Research Design : This study conduct randomize , double blind , placebo-controlled superiority trial . Three parallel treatment group examine 1:1:1 allocation : 1 ) sublingual placebo , 2 ) sublingual Melatonin 3mg , 3 ) sublingual Melatonin 10mg . Groups allocate use randomization sequence create variable random block size ( multiple 3 : 3 , 6 , 9 ) aid concealment next allocation , use random number generate software . The primary endpoint change Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory Score parent adolescent . The design allow dose dependent response assessment . Study Setting : Two academic child 's hospital Canada Target Population : All child age 13 18 year present ED ACH CHEO mTBI remain symptomatic 30 day post-injury . Intervention : Eligible patient randomize equal proportion three group : placebo , 3mg Melatonin 10mg Melatonin . Medication take sublingually one hour sleep time night 28 day continue even symptom resolution . Rationale propose dosage : Receptor-mediated effect occur physiological dos ( e.g. , child chronic insomnia effect achieve 0.05-0.15mg/kg ) . However , achieve non-Melatonin receptor mediate effect ( e.g . GABAergic effect , direct free radical scavenging antioxidant effect ) may require supra-physiological dos . 3mg Melatonin standard dose use clinical practice lower dos achieve analgesic anxiolytic effect ; however , 3mg may insufficient saturate Melatonin receptor could fall short supraphysiological dos aim achieve non-receptor mediated effect . To , high dose 10mg used logarithmical increase still clinically acceptable range . Modifications : No serious side effect report Melatonin treatment dos . Higher dos ( 70mg/day ) use child muscular dystrophy adverse event . Occasionally excessive daytime sleepiness report reported adverse event . This usually resolve day . Treatment continue unless sleepiness problematic 3 day case half tablet may try ( report study team ) . Adherence : Administration study pill occur home supervision parent . When study pill dispense , research coordinator review importance follow study guideline , instruction take study pill include timing , storage , event miss dose . Instructions purpose , use , care study pill include package . Families notify pill count every study visit importance call clinic experience problem possibly relate study product symptom , lose pill . Methodologies maximize follow-up compliance include convenient follow-up time , participant engagement strategy ( e.g . newsletter , website ) experience research personnel . Adherence assessment include daily diary , abreview medication log , pill count every week , review reason non-compliance . Unused tablet count recorded appropriate case report form . Concomitant care : There restriction use medication . All participant advise try avoid analgesia overuse . Participants ask complete diary medication , medical appointment alternative therapy .</detailed_description>
