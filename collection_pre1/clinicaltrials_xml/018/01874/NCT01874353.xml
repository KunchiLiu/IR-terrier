	<brief_summary>Comparison olaparib placebo patient ovarian cancer whose cancer already improve take platinum base chemotherapy . The patient must also fault DNA code BRCA protein . The BRCA protein help mend broken DNA cell body ; protein n't work properly increase chance get cancer . The aim study see whether patient take olaparib tablet last long cancer get bad , compare take placebo tablet . The study also look see overall improvement long patient survive whilst take olaparib tablet compare placebo tablet ; quality life whilst live ovarian cancer .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Patients must ≥ 18 year age . Female patient histologically diagnose relapse high grade serous ovarian cancer ( include primary peritoneal / fallopian tube cancer ) high grade endometrioid cancer . Documented mutation BRCA1 BRCA2 predict deleterious suspect deleterious ( know predict detrimental/lead loss function ) . Patients receive least 2 previous line platinum contain therapy prior randomisation For penultimate chemotherapy course prior enrolment study : • Patient define platinum sensitive treatment ; define disease progression great 6 month completion last dose platinum chemotherapy For last chemotherapy course immediately prior randomisation study : Patients must , opinion investigator , response ( partial complete radiological response ) , may evidence disease ( optimal cytoreductive surgery conduct prior chemotherapy ) , evidence rise CA125 , follow completion chemotherapy course Patient must receive platinum base chemotherapy regimen ( e.g . carboplatin cisplatin ) receive least 4 cycle treatment Patients must randomize within 8 week last dose chemotherapy Maintenance treatment allow end penultimate platinum regimen , include bevacizumab Involvement planning and/or conduct study ( applies AstraZeneca staff and/or staff study site ) . BRCA 1 and/or BRCA2 mutation consider non detrimental ( e.g. , `` Variants uncertain clinical significance '' `` Variant unknown significance '' `` Variant , favor polymorphism '' `` benign polymorphism '' etc . ) Patients drainage ascites final 2 cycle last chemotherapy regimen prior enrolment study .</criteria>
