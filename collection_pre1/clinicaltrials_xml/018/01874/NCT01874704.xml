	<brief_summary>A stressful state lead symptom mental exhaustion , physical fatigue , medical error , also increase coronary heart disease . Emergency physicians subjectively complain stress relate change work shift . Several potential biomarkers stress describe , never investigate emergency physician , may represent good model stress due complex interplay stress ( life-and-death emergency , define characteristic job ) , lack sleep fatigue due repeat change shifts.The aim study compare biomarkers emergency physician work 24-hour shift ( 24hS ) 14-hour night shift ( 14hS ) , work control day ( clerical work return leave ) . We also follow marker three day follow shift ( D3/24hS D3/14hS ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A stressful state lead symptom mental exhaustion physical fatigue , detachment work , feeling diminish competence . One health consequence chronic stress work increase risk coronary heart disease . Emergency physicians subjectively complain stress relate change work shift . In occupational medicine , marker stress fatigue achieve consensus . Several potential biomarkers stress describe , never investigate emergency physician , may represent good model stress due complex interplay stress ( life-and-death emergency , define characteristic job ) , lack sleep fatigue due repeat change shifts.The aim study compare HRV emergency physician work 24-hour shift ( 24hS ) 14-hour night shift ( 14hS ) , work control day ( clerical work return leave ) . We also follow marker three day follow shift ( D3/24hS D3/14hS ) . The psychological consequence shift assess term perceive stress fatigue use visual analog scale . Potential biomarkers assess urine saliva collection . Heart rate variability measure use 5-lead electrocardiogram . Psychological questionnaire complete control day . The workload shift estimate : total number entry , number admission , number outpatient ( collect computer ) , number life-and- death emergency ( give emergency physician ) . Sleep duration , include nap , assess questionnaire ( bed time - wake time ) three-day track shift control day . Shift randomization : Latin square use randomize pattern shift control day ( 24hS 14hS control day combination ) . Gaussian distribution data wil test Kolmogorov-Smirnov test . Data present mean Â± standard deviation ( SD ) . Comparisons shift make ANOVA . Relationships data assess Pearson correlation . Significance accept p &lt; 0.05 level . Statistical procedure perform use SPSS Advanced Statistics software ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL ) .</detailed_description>
