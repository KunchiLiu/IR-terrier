	<brief_summary>An investigator-initiated , prospective , consecutively enrol , non-randomized single institution clinical evaluation safety effectiveness physician modification currently FDA-approved shelf thoracic aortic stent graft ( COOK Zenith® TX2® ) preserve branch vessel use treatment patient thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm . The primary objective study determine whether physician modify branch endovascular graft safe effective method treat patient thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Branched Thoracic Endovascular Grafts Treatment Thoraco-abdominal Aortic</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A physician modify branch thoracic endograft commercially available , off-the-shelf endograft alter time procedure create reinforced fenestration graft cover stent graft deploy preserve blood flow visceral branch vessel . The graft deploy sterile work table operating room . The location fenestration mark graft accord pre-procedure measurement . The graft fabric cut simultaneously heat seal use thermal Cautery . These fenestrations/cuffs mark medical grade metal marker facilitate fluoroscopic visualization procedure . Furthermore , fenestration reinforce short ring PTFE . This add material essential strengthens fenestration create ring within branch graft seal . After fenestration create , mark , reinforce , additional metal radio-opaque marker sew graft assist device orientation fluoroscopy . Additional suture may use time constrain endograft , either temporary permanent fashion facilitate subsequent deployment . The device re-constrained re-sheathed within original Zenith® TX2® delivery sheath . The modified stent graft deploy reline peri-visceral abdominal aorta . Proximal distal fixation seal achieve use modify TX2® device , additional unmodified TX2® device and/or Cook Zenith® Flex® Endologix AFX™ device depend aortic anatomy . Once aortic stent graft deploy , branch create . Wires catheter use cross reinforce fenestration target visceral artery . Covered stent deploy extend modify aortic graft target vessel . The branch stent must create hemostatic seal main endograft branch construct within aneurysm sac . Single multiple stent may require give branch .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>All patient must meet follow inclusion criterion eligible enrollment study : 1 . Patient &gt; 18 year age 2 . Patients male nonpregnant female ( female child bear potential must negative pregnancy test prior enrollment study ) 3 . Patient Legally Authorized Representative sign Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approve Informed Consent Form 4 . Patient consider treat physician high risk open surgical repair due one major medical comorbidities ( i.e . CAD , CHF , COPD , CRI , advance age , generalize deconditioning , . ) ASA 3 . 5 . The patient life expectancy great 1 year . 6 . The patient thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm necessary visceral branch vessel ( i.e . celiac , superior mesenteric , inferior mesenteric , renal and/or dominant spinal artery ) arise aneurysm seal zone necessary onlabel thoracic endovascular repair 7 . Patient thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm meet least one following : aneurysm &gt; 5.5 cm diameter aneurysm increase size 0.5 cm last 6 month aneurysm believe cause symptom 8 . Patient sufficient arterial access ( femoral and/or iliac ) allow delivery endovascular device without use surgical conduit . 9 . Patient suitable proximal ( aorta ) distal ( aorta iliac ) arteries allow adequate fixation seal : A. Nonaneurysmal proximal aortic seal zone : 1. length 25 mm proximal seal nonaneurysmal aorta , without coverage leave subclavian artery , 2. outer wall diameter le 20 mm great 38mm , B. Nonaneurysmal distal aortic iliac land zone : 3 . With length least 15 mm , 4 . Aortic seal zone less 15 mm great 38 mm Iliac seal zone outer wall diameter le 8 mm great 23 mm . 10 . The patient 5 necessary visceral artery require flow preservation . 11 . All target visceral artery seal zone &gt; 4 mm diameter . 12 . Patient must willing comply require followup exam . Patients meet ANY follow eligible enrollment study : 1 . Patient active systemic infection 2 . Patient mycotic aneurysm . 3 . Patient known hypersensitivity contrast medium amenable pretreatment . 4 . Patient absolute contraindication anticoagulation 5 . Patient know allergy intolerance stainless steel , nickel , gold 6 . Patient body habitus would inhibit adequate Xray visualization aorta 7 . Patient dominant artery spinal cord arise area stent graft coverage amenable preservation use endovascular branch 8 . Patient currently participate another investigational device drug clinical trial 9 . Patient medical , social psychological condition , opinion investigator , preclude receive pretreatment , require treatment , posttreatment procedure evaluation . 10 . Patient freely rupture TAAA hemodynamic instability 11 . Patient unstable angina ( define angina progressive increase symptom , new onset rest nocturnal angina , onset prolonged angina ) 12 . Patient major surgical interventional procedure unrelated treatment aneurysm plan within 30 day TAAA repair . Adjunctive procedure treatment TAAA ( i.e . carotidsubclavian bypass iliac conduit ) acceptable . 13 . Patient history connective tissue disease ( e.g . Marfan Ehlers Danlos syndrome )</criteria>
