	<detailed_description>1 . Purpose study . The purpose study determine whether listen music three condition : ( 1 ) music practitioner play background harp music , ( 2 ) CD play exactly background harp music , ( 3 ) background music play effect flow , lipid ( fat ) , sodium content breast milk . PRIMARY HYPOTHESES : ( 1 ) A primiparous mother preterm infant listen music pump breast produce milk similar mother listen music . ( 2 ) A mother listen live music produce milk mother listen record music . EXPLORATORY HYPOTHESIS : ( 1 ) The milk mother listen music pump breast higher lipid content low sodium content mother listen music . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : This pilot study investigate feasibility measure amount breast milk produce mother pump breast milk preterm infant one three condition : ( 1 ) music practitioner play background harp music , ( 2 ) CD play exactly background harp music , ( 3 ) background music play . II . CHARACTERISTICS OF THE RESEARCH POPULATION 1 . Number Subjects . There total number 40 mother participate study . 2 . Gender Subjects . All subject female . Men express breast milk . 3 . Age Subjects . Mothers age 18 45 . Mothers age 18 exclude minor . Ages 18 45 typical age woman give birth . 4 . Racial Ethnic Origin . The racial ethnic distribution subject expect reflect general population mother age 18 45 deliver preterm infant Strong Memorial Hospital . 5 . Inclusion Criteria . First time mother age 18 45 vaginal caesarean delivery feeling well . First time mother use avoid confounding variable due previous positive negative experience express milk . Their infant bear less 32.0 week gestation . Mothers intend breastfeed planning pump milk site NICU least once/day recruit 7-10 day postpartum . Mothers smoke , take medication may interfere breastfeed , undergone prior breast surgery exclude since control . With regard language , mother must able understand direction sign consent form English . 6 . Exclusion Criteria . Mothers recruit whose infant low likelihood survival determine attend physician . Mothers diagnose mastitis recruit study . 7 . Vulnerable Subjects . No vulnerable subject include study . III . METHODS AND PROCEDURES 1 . Methods Procedures . : After mother agree participate , complete inform consent process complete baseline questionnaire ( pre-session 1 ) . Only one breast pumping session assess give day . All remain breast pumping session give day conduct mother per daily routine part study data collect time . Study Session 1 ( Orientation ) : The mother arrive pumping room get comfortably settle . The mother ask turn electronic equipment ( cell phone , iPod ) . Reading material Good Housekeeping , Better Homes Gardens , Parents magazine available use wish . She attach one breast Symphony Breast pump Medela standard usage NICU . ( Note : Mother decide pump one breast time . Whatever condition choose remain throughout study session . ) Recorded music played session . While breast pump apply , third female person enter room remain behind privacy screen . This third person either research assistant , physician , nurse train patient confidentiality right research subject . When breast pump apply , third person start record music . She communication mother research assistant . The mother pump breast ( ) 80 cc volufeed container . The research assistant sit behind mother face away mother mother pump time pump 15 minute . The amount milk produce 15 minute period measure record research assistant . To ensure mother meet baby 's need , 2 cc aliquot take 10 cc produce 15 minute ; include current pumping session , sufficient milk 24 hour infant feeding . If previous two condition meet , lactation consultant mother 's nurse remove 2 cc aliquot end session . The 2 cc aliquot frozen future analysis . If previous two condition meet , 2 cc aliquot take noted data collection sheet . The remain milk combine additional milk mother may produce remainder pump session . She label store milk later use infant accord usual routine . When mother tell research assistant complete pumping , third person quietly leave room . The mother randomize receive three experimental condition ( live music , record music , music ) random order course three pump session . She experience three condition random order ( three-block pattern randomize twice . ) Study Sessions 2-7 : The mother arrive pumping room become comfortably settle . The mother ask turn electronic equipment ( cell phone , iPod ) . Reading material Good Housekeeping , Better Homes Gardens , Parents magazine available use wish . She attach one breast Symphony Breast pump Medela standard use NICU . ( Note : Mother decide pump one breast time . Whatever condition choose remain throughout study session . ) The mother tell whether live , record , music play session . While breast pump apply , third female person enter room remain behind privacy screen . If live music play , third person musician . In order provide condition even music play , third female still enter room remain behind privacy screen . She communication mother research assistant . At point , either live music , record music , music played . When music play , music play session . The mother pump breast ( ) 80 cc volufeed container . The research assistant sit behind mother face away mother mother pump time pump 15 minute . The amount milk produce 15-minute period measure record research assistant data collection sheet . To ensure mother meet baby 's need , 2 cc aliquot take 10 cc produce 15 minute ; include current pumping session , sufficient milk 24 hour infant feeding . If previous two condition meet , lactation consultant mother 's nurse remove 2 cc aliquot end session . The 2 cc aliquot frozen future analysis . If previous two condition meet , 2cc aliquot take noted data collection sheet . The remain milk combine additional milk mother may produce remainder pump session . She label store milk later use infant accord usual routine . When mother tell research assistant complete pumping , third person stop playing , turn player , and/or simply quietly leave room . ASSESSMENTS ( attach ) : Mothers complete Pre-session 1 ( orientation ) questionnaire provide general demographic information well information mother 's reason plan duration breastfeeding . The research assistant complete questionnaire mother 's assistance appropriate subsequent session ( 2-7 ) . Assessments session 2-7 inquire session well mother 's emotional state . The mother complete final questionnaire session 7 regard experience live music , record music , quiet pump breast . The fat content sodium content breast milk sample obtain session 2-7 measure . 2 . Data Analysis Monitoring . The mother serve control . Milk produce 15 minute measure session amount milk produce two session identical condition average . The primary outcome difference amount milk produce mother three condition . We use 40 subject , subject control . This sample size allow u detect effect size 0.5 , assume pair t-test Bonferroni-corrected p value 0.025 ( account two primary comparison ) . We use factorial repeated measure ANOVA - `` condition '' ( live music , record music , music ) main effect examine . We run contrast examine two hypothesis . Since mother act control , examine within-subject difference . Thus , infant age , weight , medical condition internally control included analysis . However , variables mother 's emotional physical condition time since last pumping , could change day-to-day , could include modeling , significant within-subject variance . The sodium content milk measure use standard clinical laboratory procedure . Lipid ( fat ) content milk measure use creamatocrit ( 10 ) . 3 . Data Storage Confidentiality . Data enter password-protected encrypted electronic database accessible study personnel . All print/paper form keep lock file locked office limit accessibility suite .</detailed_description>
