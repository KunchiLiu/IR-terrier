	<brief_summary>The aim study compare efficacy two photosensitizers , methyl-aminolaevulinate ( MAL ) 5-aminolaevulinic nanoemulsion ( BF-200 ALA ) treatment facial actinic keratosis . We use randomize , double-blinded prospective study design . The efficacy assess clinically , histopathologically immunohistochemically .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Daylight-PDT AKs : Comparing Two Photosensitizers ( BF-200 ALA MAL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Actinic keratoses ( AKs ) superficial premalignant skin lesion progress invasive metastatic squamous cell carcinoma . AKs treat photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) , cure rate compare cryo surgery excellent cosmesis . In PDT AK lesion first curettaged , photosensitizer apply skin let absorb 3 hour . The skin illuminate use blue red light source light source depend photosensitizer , induces activation protoporphyrin IX ( PpIX ) phototoxic reaction destroy cancer cell . The approved photosensitizers Europe methyl-aminolevulinic acid cream , ( MAL , Metvix™ , Galderma ) , patch contain 5-aminolevulinic acid ( 5-ALA , Alacare® , Spirig AG ) 5-aminolevulinic acid gel ( BF-200 ALA , Ameluz® , Biofrontera AG ) use red LED light ( 630-635 nm ) . In North America 5-aminolevulinic acid stick ( 5-ALA , Levulan® Kerastick ) also use blue light source ( 417 nm ) . PpIX absorption peak within visual spectrum light , allow PpIX daylight activation . During natural daylight PDT ( NDL-PDT ) protocol , PpIX continuously activate development , whereas conventional PDT ( LED-PDT ) use red LED lamp , large amount accumulate PpIX momentarily activate . Since skin field cancerization refers presence different degree visible invisible dysplastic change , whole area treat prevent development non-melanoma skin cancer ( NMSCs ) . NDL-PDT enables treatment field cancerization one sit whereas LED-PDT may need repeated illumination cover whole area . NDL-PDT result enhance cost-efficacy due reduced staff expense , since 's need sensitizer absorption illumination . At moment two photosensitizers market authorization Finland , ALA ( Ameluz® ) MAL ( Metvix™ ) . We pilot study compare efficacy two light sensitizer NDL-PDT . The efficacy treatment assess clinically , histopathologically immunohistochemically .</detailed_description>
