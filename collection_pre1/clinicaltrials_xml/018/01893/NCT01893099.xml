	<brief_summary>The best way combine loco-regional procedure chemoembolisation radioembolization combine anti-angiogenic drug clear . This phase I trial aim establish , first , tolerability combination liver radioembolization SirSpheres® sorafenib uveal melanoma patient liver metastasis study different schedule administration sorafenib radioembolization . Secondly , aim evaluate angiogenic marker modification different schedule , either serum radiologicaly . Dose Sorafenib 400 mg BID timing introduction differ one cohort , give radioembolization initial cohort finally , concomitantly radioembolization last cohort .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary objective : To evaluate safety tolerability sorafenib combination SIR-Spheres® radioembolization uveal melanoma patient metastatic liver . Secondary objective : - Translational research biomarkers ( blood liver biopsy ) well radiological exam use microbubble contrast enhance ultrasound . Angiogenic marker VEGF , IGF-2 , TFG Angiopoietin-2 IL-8 monitor . Correlations investigate angiogenic marker ( blood &amp; tumor tissue ) , angiogenic radiological exam response treatment . - To evaluate response , clinical benefit , PFS survival patient .</detailed_description>
