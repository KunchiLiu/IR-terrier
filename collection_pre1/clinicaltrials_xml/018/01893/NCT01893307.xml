	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study compare side effect 2 radiation treatment head neck cancer . The 2 treatment intensity modulate photon therapy ( IMRT ) intensity modulate proton therapy ( IMPT ) . Participants may also receive chemotherapy along radiation therapy . IMPT design use beam proton particle send radiation tumor . IMRT design use beam photon therapy send radiation tumor . Both type radiation treatment may give full dose radiation treatment tumor damage much healthy tissue around .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Trial Intensity-Modulated Proton Beam Therapy ( IMPT ) Versus Intensity-Modulated Photon Therapy ( IMRT ) Treatment Oropharyngeal Cancer Head Neck</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Baseline Visit : If find eligible take part study , baseline visit . The following test procedure perform : - You ask diet recent weight loss . - You hear test . - You dental exam . - Your swallow function test special type x-ray call modify barium swallow ( MBS ) . During test , eat drink food liquids mixed `` contrast '' chemical call barium make throat visible x-ray . A special x-ray tube connect television screen allow doctor watch food liquid pass mouth throat . As part exam , time fill questionnaire swallow take 5 minute complete . - You video-strobe procedure allow doctor look vocal cord . To perform video-strobe procedure , small camera insert throat nose mouth . You awake procedure study staff give option receive numb spray nose and/or throat . Photos inside mouth take check mouth sore . - You fill questionnaire quality life , work status , medical history , smoke status , symptom may . Completing questionnaire take 10-15 minute . An email address collect transmitting questionnaire . An email address collect transmitting questionnaire . - Saliva collect visit , end treatment , also follow 2 year . You fast minimum 60 minute instruction regard collection give . Study Groups : You go standard radiation treatment planning procedure , call marking session . After mark session , standard IMRT plan IMPT plan make . If radiation doctor think plan acceptable , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 study group : If Group 1 , receive IMRT . If Group 2 , receive IMPT . Study Therapy Administration : You receive radiation therapy 1 time day , 5 day week ( Monday Friday ) 33 treatment ( 6 ½ week ) . You receive chemotherapy receiving radiation therapy . If occurs , ask sign separate consent form drug full description give risk may cause . The drug , schedule , dose doctor 's decision . Study Visits : Every week receive radiation therapy : - Any updates medical history record . - You physical exam , include measurement vital sign weight . - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - You fill questionnaire . - At Weeks 3 7 , photo inside mouth take check mouth sore . Length Treatment : You may continue receive radiation therapy 6 ½ week . You longer able receive study therapy disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up . You decide stop take part study study doctor tell stop safely . It important tell study doctor think stop side effect treatment look doctor . Another reason tell doctor think stop discuss follow-up care test could helpful . End-of-Treatment Visit : After finish radiation therapy : - You fill questionnaire . - You mouth exam check swallow function . - You dental exam . During exam , saliva collect look saliva . - Photos inside mouth take check mouth sore . Follow-Up : At 10-12 week finish radiation therapy : - You fill questionnaire . - You hear test . - You dental exam . During exam , saliva collect look saliva . - Photos inside mouth take check mouth sore . - If doctor think need , CT scan and/or PET/CT scan check status disease . At end radiation therapy every follow-up : - You MBS exam test swallow function . - You fill questionnaire . - Saliva collect follow visit 2 year . - Photos inside mouth take check mouth sore follow 2 year . - You video-strobe procedure allow doctor look vocal cord . - You hear test 12 24 month . - If doctor think need , CT and/or PET scan follow-up visit . After finish radiation therapy 8-12 week recover treatment , call email automated system . This remind fill web-based form ask side effect may . You fill form every 2 week time period . Filling form take 10-15 minute . Filling form take place regularly schedule follow-up visit . If side effect , also tell study staff . If doctor think need follow-up , tumor biopsy tumor marker test . This investigational study . IMRT IMPT deliver use FDA-approved commercially available method . Comparing investigational . Up 360 participant enrol study . Up 250 patient take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
