	<brief_summary>The propose study pragmatic , randomize , open-label clinical trial 24 week XR-NTX vs. O-NTX use COMBINE-adapted Medical Management primary care treatment model . 234 adult &gt; 18yo alcohol dependence recruit community treatment public sector primary care setting . The primary outcome power study dichotomous good clinical outcome define abstinence moderate drinking , measure Timeline Follow-back analyze use intention-to-treat approach among randomized participant . Secondary outcome include incremental cost effectiveness two arm , difference arm continuous measure alcohol intake ( drinks/day , % day abstinent , time first heavy drinking day , bio-markers ) , exploratory analysis factor possibly associate effectiveness , include gender , prior treatment abstinence , mu opioid receptor ( OPRM1 ) genotype . Specific Aim 1 : Treatment Effectiveness . To evaluate effectiveness extended-release naltrexone ( XR-NTX ) vs. oral naltrexone ( O-NTX ) produce primary good clinical outcome , define abstinence moderate drinking ( &lt; 2 drinks/day , men ; &lt; 1drink/day , woman ; &lt; 2 heavy drink occasions/month ) , final 20 24 week primary care-based Medical Management alcohol dependence . Hypothesis : The rate good clinical outcome approximately twice great among participant receive XR-NTX compare receive O-NTX . Specific Aim 2 : Cost Effectiveness . To estimate incremental cost effectiveness XR-NTX vs. O-NTX , conjunction primary care-based Medical Management . Hypothesis : XR-NTX treatment cost effective O-NTX . Specific Aim 3 : Patient-Level Predictors Effectiveness . To identify patient-level characteristic associated effectiveness arm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Extended-Release v . Oral Naltrexone Alcohol Treatment Primary Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Though integration alcohol pharmacotherapy primary care setting receive increase emphasis support , rigorous data inform clinician ' treatment choice lacking . The recently FDA-approved alcohol treatment medication , extended-release depot form naltrexone ( XR-NTX , VivitrolÂ® ) , could greatly simplify medical home-centered alcohol treatment emphasize National Institute Alcohol Abuse Alcoholism ( NIAAA ) Clinician 's Guide . Injected month , XR-NTX offer long-acting thus potentially effective form pharmacotherapy oral naltrexone ( O-NTX ) , , despite Combined Pharmacotherapies Behavioral Interventions Alcohol Dependence ( COMBINE ) trial systematic review support efficacy , characterize low rate overall prescribing , poor adherence , suboptimal monthly refill inadequate treatment retention . Yet promising alternative O-NTX , XR-NTX substantially expensive ( ~ $ 1100 vs. ~ $ 100 per month ) , head-to-head trial compare two form naltrexone . A comparative effectiveness approach require systematically evaluate follow key question : In primary care setting , relative clinical effectiveness XR-NTX vs. O-NTX ? What benefit cost XR-NTX relative O-NTX ? And patient system characteristic identify inform treatment choice maximize probability successful outcome ? Implications : Despite several year experience , comparative effectiveness XR-NTX compare old alcohol medication remain uncertain , particularly mainstream , primary care treatment model generalizable broadly accessible . Newer , novel , expensive medication addiction disorder historically greatly underutilized primary care physicians . This study innovative 'head-to-head ' evaluation XR-NTX vs. O-NTX primary care , expect participant primarily Medicaid-covered uninsured person exclude base medical psychiatric co-morbidities often preclude participation efficacy study . If health insurance expansion , parity reform , medical home accountable care organization define primary care core alcohol treatment set come decade , exactly type study require guide treatment protocol resource allocation . Ultimately , widespread adoption cost-effective alcohol pharmacotherapies result long , healthier life low cost .</detailed_description>
