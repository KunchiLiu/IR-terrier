	<brief_summary>The prevalence obesity continue increase alarm rate sector population US . Obesity old adult cohort great concern associate reduction mobility , decline physical performance increase risk physical disability . With regard body composition , ) fat mass determine strong predictor mobility limitation low muscle mass old individual alternatively , b ) leg lean mass also cite primary determinant lower extremity physical function . Obesity relate increased level fatigue lack motivation mental energy . Fatigue categorize subjective perception performance decrement . Fatigue define perceived lack physical mental energy fatigability another construct categorize degree fatigue associate activity dimension ( i.e . physical , mental , emotional , and/or social ) . The impact high protein diet muscle quality , muscle fatigability , perception fatigue systemic inflammation older adult well document . The utility high protein weight loss diet combine resistance exercise training augment fat mass loss , attenuate lean mass loss improve muscle quality physical function could potentially high value overweight old woman . The potential benefit regimen enhance mental energy aspect psycho-social well-being unknown . The aims present study include assess effect propose diet exercise intervention 1 ) body composition , 2 ) strength muscle quality , 3 ) energy fatigue symptom .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our target population include 75 overweight obese ( BMI &gt; /= 25kg/m^2 ) woman age 65 80 . This study use parallel-arm design . After block age BMI , 75 overweight obese ( BMI ≥ 25 kg/m2 ) old female ( 65 - 80 old ) randomize three group ; PRO CARB diet combine exercise ( PRO+EX ; n=25 , CARB+EX ; n=25 ) PRO ( n=25 ) without exercise 6 month . All group goal lose ~10 % initial body weight . We anticipate adherence rate 80 % ( n = 20 group remain ) . At initiation study , subject weight stable ( within 2 kg ) past 6 mo sedentary ( define &lt; 1h/wk less 2 exercise session per week last 6 month ) . Eligible participant plan live community duration study . Exclusion criterion include chronic disease/condition would permit exercise dietary restriction alter interpretation data . All subject require personal physician clearance prior enrollment . Main outcome variable interest whole body composition , regional body composition , muscle strength endurance quality , physical function , fatigue biomarkers related fatigue .</detailed_description>
