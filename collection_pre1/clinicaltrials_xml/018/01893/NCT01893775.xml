	<brief_summary>Background : - Celiac disease condition immune system attack cell small intestine . The intestine become inflamed digest food properly . The disease often cause reaction food contain gluten . Most people treat celiac disease gluten-free diet . However , people digestion problem even gluten-free diet . Researchers want try new antibody therapy celiac disease . The treatment may block immune reaction cause disease . They test antibody people celiac disease respond gluten-free diet . Objectives : - To see antibody therapy safe effective treatment celiac disease respond standard treatment . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age gluten-free diet 6 12 month still symptoms celiac disease . Design : - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood sample collect . These sample help determine specific antibody treatment likely work . - Before start study , participant biopsy small intestine . - Participants receive three dos study antibody injection . These dos give 3 week apart . - Treatment monitor blood test heart function test . Participants also second small intestine biopsy within week last dose antibody .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Celiac disease complex inflammatory disorder autoimmune component characterize dramatic expansion intraepithelial cytotoxic T lymphocytes usually regress gluten-free diet . - It estimate approximately 10 % patient become refractory gluten-free diet . - A subgroup refractory celiac disease characterize expansion highly oligoclonal intraepithelial T-lymphocyte population exhibit high risk develop enteropathy associate T-cell lymphoma ( EATL ) . - There presently effective therapy refractory celiac disease . - A number study indicate intestinal epithelial derive IL-15 play critical role disrupt intraepithelial lymphocyte homeostasis lymphomagenesis characterize refractory celiac disease . - A pivotal role IL-15 refractory celiac disease EATL support find two murine model celiac disease pathognomonic feature reverse completely administration antibody CD122 ( IL-2/IL-15R beta ) block IL-15 transpresentation action . - A Phase I clinical trial patient T-cell LGL hematocytopenia use monoclonal antibody , Hu-Mik-Beta-1 block IL-15 action produce cGMP condition BDP NCI complete Metabolism Branch , NCI Clinical Center NIH . Objectives : Primary Objectives : - Phase I trial define safety Hu-Mik-Beta-1 infusion 3 group 3 patient refractory celiac disease escalate 0.5 , 1.0 , 1.5 mg/kg dos . - To define clinical efficacy Hu-Mik-Beta-1 infusion 9 patient refractory celiac disease correlate finding celiac disease specific test . Secondary Objectives : - Definition receptor saturation capacity CD122 ( IL-2/IL-15R beta ) intravenously administer Hu-Mik-Beta-1 administer 0.5 , 1.0 1.5 mg/kg body weight 3 group patient three occasion separate 3 week patient refractory celiac disease . - Determine immunogenicity intravenously administer Hu-Mik-Beta-1 . - Determine effect Hu-Mik-Beta-1 phenotype state activation element cellular immune system circulation intestinal biopsy special focus cell implicate pathogenesis celiac disease . Eligibility : - Patients refractory celiac disease ( RCD ) define follow internationally accept criterion : persistent recurrent symptom ( diarrhea , weight loss , abdominal pain ) associate intestinal damage characterize partial total villous atrophy intraepithelial lymphocyte ( define &gt; 25 intraepithelial lymphocyte per 100 epithelial cell ) despite strict adherence gluten-free diet 6-12 month . - Lack antibodies Hu-Mik-Beta-1 . - Patients circulate antibody tissue transglutaminase great 10 assay unit use recombinant human transglutaminase antibody . Design : - Patients enrol treated Mayo Clinic University Chicago Clinical Center NIH involve laboratory site . This nonrandomized openlabel phase I trial . - In phase I trial initial patient enrol receive 0.5 mg/kg Hu-Mik-Beta-1 ( 3 patient ) . Patients receive Hu-Mik-Beta-1 every 3 week total 3 dos ( give day 1 , week 3 week 6 ) . At specific point time patient monitor ( see ) . If 1 3 patient receive 0.5 mg/kg Hu-Mik-Beta-1 experience NCI CTCAE version 4.0 grade 3 great toxicity exception fatigue &gt; 4days duration possibly , probably definitely related infusion Hu-Mik-Beta-1 , subject enrollment dosing stop . - At completion Week 9 , safety data review Sponsor DSMB . If safety data 0.5 mg/kg cohort acceptable , Sponsor may enroll additional patient dose great 0.5 mg/kg , evaluate similar manner 0.5 mg/kg ( e.g. , 3 patient receive 1 mg/kg Hu-Mik-Beta-1 every 3 week total 3 dos . - The step describe repeat safety data 1 mg/kg cohort acceptable , Sponsor may enroll 3 patient receive 1.5 mg/kg Hu-Mik-Beta-1 every 3 week total 3 dos , etc. ) . - The step describe repeat safety data 1.5 mg/kg cohort acceptable , Sponsor may enroll additional 3 patient receive 1.5 mg/kg Hu-Mik- Beta-1 every 3 week total 3 dos . Monitoring : - At specific point time follow cardiac tests/studies obtain , result review prior subsequent dos ( week 3 week 6 ) : i. EKG screening ( Week -4 0 ) , Day 1 , Week 3 , Week 6 Week 7. ii . CK-MB troponin I screen ( Week -4 0 ) , Day 1 , Day 7 , Week 3 , Week 6 , Week 7 . In addition , echocardiogram screening ( Week -4 0 ) Week 7 . - FACS peripheral blood mononuclear cell peroral intestinal biopsy expression NKG2D , CD94 , NKG2C , NKG2A , NKb44 , NKb30 , CD158 granzyme . - Immune profile intestinal biopsy perform first infusion one week + -3 day follow third infusion analyze CD8 T-cells , TCR gamma rearrangement multiplex PCR fluorescence analysis CD8 CD3 expression , high-resolution PCR expression immunoglobulin gene rearrangement IEL , ERK JNK phosphorylation reflect abnormal IEL activation . - Furthermore , IL-15 , IL-15R alpha interferon alpha expression assay cell intestinal biopsy serum . - FACS PBMCs Hu-Mik-Beta-1 Hu-Mik-Beta-3 define saturation CD122 ( IL2/IL-15R beta ) . Endpoints : - Complete clinical response clinical biochemical result 20-week time point . - Secondary partial response , duration response , toxicity , immunogenicity Hu-Mik-Beta- 1 .</detailed_description>
