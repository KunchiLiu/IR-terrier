	<detailed_description>RSV common viral cause serious acute lower respiratory illness ( LRI ) infants child 5 year age around world . RSV illness range mild upper respiratory tract illness ( URI ) severe LRI , include bronchiolitis pneumonia . The purpose study evaluate safety immunogenicity single dose RSV vaccine healthy child . Study researcher first evaluate vaccine healthy RSV-seropositive child evaluate vaccine healthy RSV-seronegative infant child . This study first enroll healthy RSV-seropositive child age 12 59 month ( Group 1 ) . At study entry , participant undergo medical history review , physical examination , blood collection , nasal wash procedure . Participants randomly assign receive either RSV vaccine placebo vaccine , administer nose drop . Subjects actively monitor 28 day follow administration vaccine placebo ; monitor include medical history review , clinical assessment , visit , nasal wash . On day study visit schedule , study researcher contact participant ' parent guardian medical follow-up . Study researcher evaluate study data participant Group 1 enrol participant Group 2 , study data Group 2 review enrol participant Group 3 . Participants Groups 2 3 include healthy RSV-seronegative infant child age 6 24 month . These participant also randomly assign receive either RSV vaccine placebo vaccine , administer nose drop . Subjects actively monitor 56 day follow administration vaccine placebo ; monitor include medical history review , clinical assessment , visit , nasal wash . On day study visit schedule , study researcher contact participant ' parent guardian medical follow-up . At study visit Day 56 , participant undergo medical history review , blood collection , nasal wash procedure . For participant Groups 2 3 , November March follow participant 's vaccination visit , parent guardian monitor participant RSV-associated illness report weekly basis via telephone call study researcher . Participants may additional study visit may include blood collection and/or nasal wash procedure follow-up period .</detailed_description>
