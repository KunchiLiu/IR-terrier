	<brief_summary>Rheumatoid arthritis patient increase risk cardiovascular disease systemic inflammation persist even patient well-controlled joint disease . We hypothesize add anti-tumor necrosis factor medication , adalimumab , standard non-biologic therapy rheumatoid arthritis improve endothelial function ( reduce cardiovascular risk ) patient . The design trial follow : 18 month prospective , randomize , double-blind crossover trial compare addition adalimumab addition placebo . The primary endpoint change endothelial cell function , detect brachial artery FMD , 6 month adalimumab treatment compare 6 month placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Adalimumab Lower Cardiovascular Risk RA Patients With Well Controlled Joint Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Excess mortality associate RA due largely CVD explain traditional risk factor . Although articular manifestation usually dominate clinical picture , RA systemic inflammatory disease , systemic inflammation think underlie mechanism responsible increase CVD risk associate RA . Because chronic inflammation persist treat RA patient little clinically detectable joint inflammation , treatment target base largely clinically measure joint activity may adequately suppress systemic inflammation associate progression atherosclerosis . The ACR recommend treatment therapeutic target low disease activity determine standardized clinical assessment . We hypothesize treated RA patient reach ACR target low disease activity nonetheless persist systemic inflammation contributes atherogenesis . We hypothesize acceleration RA-directed therapy systemic anti-inflammatory treatment ( TNF inhibition ) patient low disease activity improve endothelial function , reduce vascular inflammation improve functionality HDL particle , key biological feature progression atherosclerosis clinical manifestation . Trial design : Prospective , randomize , double-blind crossover trial compare addition adalimumab addition placebo . Study population : 60 RA patient non-biological DMARDs low disease activity determine standardized clinical assessment ( Disease Activity Score 28 joint [ DAS28 ] &lt; 3.2 ) . Primary endpoint : Primary endpoint change endothelial cell function , detect brachial artery FMD , 6 month adalimumab treatment compare 6 month placebo . We postulate anti-TNF therapy adalimumab lead absolute increase 2 % FMD , typically translate 15 % reduction cardiovascular event rate .</detailed_description>
