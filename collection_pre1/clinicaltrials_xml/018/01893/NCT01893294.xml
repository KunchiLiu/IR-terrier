	<brief_title>Gemcitabine Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) intra-tumoral injection gemcitabine ( gemcitabine hydrochloride ) administer one time initial induction therapy conjunction ( = &lt; 33 hour ) prior conventional multimodality treatment locally advance pancreatic cancer ( LAPC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate initial delay toxicity associate treatment regimen . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intratumorally ( IT ) day 1 . Within 33 hour , patient receive standard chemotherapy comprise fluorouracil intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 , 29 , 36 undergo standard radiation therapy 5 day week 6 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
