	<brief_title>Innate Immune Response ( An ) Aerobic Exercise Rowing Athletes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Exercise induces innate immune response activation athlete . The response start exercise last approximately 24 hour . This innate immune response show similarity innate immune activation observe , example , bacterial infection trauma . Immediately exercise , athletes develop leukocytosis cytokine production alter towards inflammatory pattern . However , gain insight immune response , detail cell receptor expression require . To investigate physiological innate immune response exercise , develop model rower . Objective : To determine type degree cellular inflammatory response peripheral blood elite row athlete anaerobe aerobe exercise . Study design : Investigator driven , monocenter observational pilot study . Study population : 16 healthy , non-asthmatic , human volunteer , 18-25 year old . All competitive rowing athlete . Intervention : All athlete perform two separate test row ergometer . One anaerobe ( flat ) exercise test ( minute ) day 1 aerobe test ( 1 hour ) day 2 . Blood withdrawal 9mL perform four time point ( 1 pretest time point 3 post : 0h , 2 4h ) . Main study parameters/endpoints : The main endpoint rise neutrophil cell count appearance different subset neutrophils objectify change receptor expression . Not neutrophils important innate cell response , leukocytes like lymphocyte , monocyte hematopoietic progenitor cell also play role . Therefore detailed analysis receptor profile cell measure Flowcytometry . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : The anaerobe aerobe exercise test differ significantly athlete use training purpose . Athletes experience pain discomfort exercise advise stop . Blood withdrawal may cause vasovagal response especially well trained athlete susceptible develop response . A trained physician present take care look rower suffer vasovagal collapse . All anaerobe exercise bring along small risk acute cardiovascular complication although rower undergo exercise testing exercise physiologist participate competition , risk remains . The total amount time study 2 time 5 hour . This time frame consist prior blood withdrawal , test subsequently three time point blood withdrawal . The amount blood withdrawal per athlete 4 x 9mL , total 36 mL per volunteer one day test . The total blood withdrawal therefore 72 mL base two testing day .</detailed_description>
