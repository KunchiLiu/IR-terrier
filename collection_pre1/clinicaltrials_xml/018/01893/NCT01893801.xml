	<brief_title>Nab-Paclitaxel+Cisplatin+Gemcitabine Patients With Previously Untreated Metastatic Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma ( PDA )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 1b/2 open-label pilot study evaluate preliminary efficacy safety nab-paclitaxel , cisplatin , gemcitabine patient metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma . An individual cycle therapy define Days 1 8 every 21 day . Multiple cycle may administer patient withdrawn therapy . Overall response rate well individual category response ( complete response-CR , partial response-PR , stable disease-SD progressive disease-PD ) determine use RECIST 1.1 . Time-to-event endpoint , include progression free survival ( PFS ) OS ( overall survival ) assess use Kaplan-Meier method . Evaluation stable disease 9 week also assess . Toxicity ( adverse event ) record use NCI CTCAE ( v4.0 , May 2009 ) .</detailed_description>
