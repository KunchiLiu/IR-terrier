	<brief_summary>This project intend evaluate self-emulsifying drug delivery system term Piperine-Pro-Nano-Lipospheres ( P-PNL ) enhance oral bioavailability tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) cannabidiol ( CBD ) .The oral bioavailability cannabinoids hamper extensive first pas metabolism , result relative bioavailability 6 % . The main goal study evaluate bioequivalence THC-CBD P-PNL product oral administration Sativex® buccal spray , measure AUC 0-24h , Tmax Cmax .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Assessment Oral Administration Vs . Oral Spray Cannabinoids ( Tetrahydrocannabinol Cannabidiol )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) disabling , lifelong disease central nervous system . The currently available treatment analgesic drug management MS associate pain limited efficacy , frequently uncontrolled . The successful treatment MS pain find use combination Δ 9 -Tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) Cannabidiol ( CBD ) 1:1 ratio . The rationale combination two cannabinoids arouse report scientific literature CBD could potentiate therapeutic effect THC also diminish undesirable effect THC anxiety , panic , sedation , dysphonia tachycardia . Additionally , co-administration THC CBD report safe tolerance , abuse withdrawal effect . Although therapeutic rationale THC CBD combination establish , optimal oral dosage form deliver cannabinoids combination available yet . The reason mark `` first pas '' metabolic effect cannabinoids gastrointestinal tract lead limited oral bioavailability 6 % . In project shall utilize biopharmaceutical experience use advanced self-emulsifying drug delivery system term Piperine-Pro-Nano-Lipospheres ( P-PNL ) enhance oral bioavailability THC CBD . P-PNL isotropic mixture natural alkaloid ( piperine ) active compound ( THC CBD ) combination lipid , surfactant co-solvent term pre-concentrate , administer soft gelatin capsule . We show pre-clinical investigation incorporation THC CBD P-PNL promising strategy enhance oral bioavailability . Thus , primary goal study : evaluate bioequivalence develop THC-CBD P-PNL product oral administration Sativex® . This currently available product THC CBD combination . Sativex® solution administer spray onto oromucosal surface bypass `` first pas '' metabolism cannabinoids associate intestinal absorption . SATIVEX® approve various country ( i.e . Canada , UK , Spain , New Zealand Israel-distributed Neopharm ) MS pain treatment Canada also cancer pain treatment . The study perform 12 healthy male volunteer . It open label , cross-over single-arm two sequence study intend evaluate pharmacokinetics THC CBD . Each volunteer receive THC : CBD capsule Sativex® . Both study group THC-CBD-Piperine-PNL vs. Sativex® receive identical dos THC CBD ; 21.6 mg 20 mg respectively . blood sample withdraw indwell cannula forearm 30 minute ( pre-dose ) every 30 minute interval first 4 hour blood sample take , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 12 24 hour intake study drug . Blood concentration profile THC , CBD main metabolite : 11-hydroxy-THC , 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC CBD-glucoronide determine order calculate pharmacokinetic parameter THC CBD .</detailed_description>
