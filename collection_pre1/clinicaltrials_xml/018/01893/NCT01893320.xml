	<brief_title>Study Vosaroxin Decitabine Older Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia High-risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign study group base join study . Up 4 group 6 participant enrol Phase I portion study , 60 participant enrol Phase II . If enrolled Phase I portion , dose vosaroxin receive depend join study . The first group participant receive high dose level vosaroxin . If intolerable side effect see , study move Phase II . If intolerable side effect see , new group receive low dose vosaroxin group tolerable dose find . If enrol Phase II portion , receive vosaroxin high dose tolerate Phase I portion . All participant receive dose level decitabine . Study Drug Administration : You receive study drug cycle . The study cycle 4-12 week long , depend if/how disease respond treatment , bone marrow react treatment , doctor think best interest . On Days 1-5 study cycle , receive decitabine vein 1 hour . On Days 1 4 cycle , also receive vosaroxin vein 8-10 minute , receive decitabine . Depending disease responds study drug , number day receive study drug may change . Your doctor discus . The first 2 cycle call Induction Cycles . All cycle call Consolidation Cycles . All participant receive Induction Cycle 1 . If study doctor think need , also receive Induction Cycle 2 . If study doctor think best interest , receive 5 Consolidation Cycles treatment . Study Visits : On Day 1 cycle , physical exam . Every week , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . If point appear response study drug , blood drawn every 1-2 week still receive study drug . If doctor think need , blood may need drawn . On Day 21 Cycle 1 ( +/- 7 day ) , every 4 week , bone marrow aspiration and/or biopsy check status disease . If doctor think need , may do less often , depend response study drug . Length Study : You may receive study drug 7 cycle . You take study disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , study doctor think best interest . Your participation study follow-up period . End-of-Study Visit : If take study leave study early , end-of-study visit . At visit : Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If study doctor think need , bone marrow aspiration . You contact study visit call ask side effect may 30 day end-of-study visit . This call last 5 minute . Follow-up : If leave study early , follow-up visit call 5 year stop receive study drug . Every 4-8 week , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . If return clinic , may blood drawn clinic close home . Every 3-6 month , contact clinic visit ask . If make clinic visit , call . The phone call last 5 minute . This investigational study . Vosaroxin FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Decitabine approve FDA treatment MDS , precursor AML , approve treatment AML . The use drug combination investigational . The study doctor explain drug design work . Up 84 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
