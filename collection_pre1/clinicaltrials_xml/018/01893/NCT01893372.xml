	<brief_title>Eltrombopag With Without Hypomethylating Agent After Hypomethylating Agent Failure For Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndrome ( MDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign 1 2 arms.The selection treatment arm make treat physician . - If Arm A , receive eltrombopag alone . - If Arm B , receive eltrombopag continue receive hypomethylating agent receive take part study . Study Drug Administration : You take eltrombopag mouth every day 28-day study cycle . If Arm B , also continue take hypomethylating agent take join study dose schedule receive enter study . Eltrombopag take empty stomach ( 1 hour 2 hour meal ) . Do eat calcium-rich food ( dairy product calcium fortify juice ) , take drug ( antacid ) supplement contain iron , calcium , aluminum , magnesium , selenium , and/or zinc 2 hour 4 hour take eltrombopag . If dose eltrombopag vomit , make re-taken day . If morning dose miss , may take 5:00 PM day . Study Visits : On Day 1 Cycles : - You physical exam include vital sign . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . On Days 8 , 15 , 22 Cycle 1 : - Your vital sign ( blood pressure , heart rate , temperature ) measure . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If doctor think need , Day 1 every 3 cycle ( Cycles 3 , 6 , 9 , ) , also bone marrow aspirate/biopsy check status disease cytogenetic testing . Length Study : You may continue take study drug ( ) long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug ( ) disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study follow-up visit . End-of-Treatment Visit : Within 5 day last dose study drug , come clinic end-of-treatment visit . The following procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - You may bone marrow aspirate/biopsy collect check status disease cytogenetic testing . Follow-up Visit : About 28 day last dose study drug , come clinic follow-up visit . follow procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . This investigational study . Eltrombopag FDA approve commercially available treatment low platelet count patient idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP -- severe bleed disease ) . Its use study investigational . Azacitidine decitabine FDA approve treatment MDS commercially available . The study doctor explain study drug ( ) design work . Up 46 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
