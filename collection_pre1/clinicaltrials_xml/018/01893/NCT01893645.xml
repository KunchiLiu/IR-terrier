	<brief_summary>The measurement blood hemoglobin ( Hb ) concentration routine procedure pregnant woman . The assessment Hb involve several step , include needle stick , blood collection , blood sample analysis laboratory , wait result . Pronto-7 ( manufacture Masimo , CA , USA ) new portable device allow quick bedside Hb spot check . A finger clip probe , similar standard oxygen finger clip probe , provide hemoglobin value less 60 second . In prospective observational study investigator assess clinical accuracy Pronto-7 derive Hb value compare gold standard laboratory Hb value obstetric patient . We calculate mean difference Pronto-7 laboratory Hb value . We plan recruit 55 pregnant woman admit vaginal cesarean delivery BC Women 's Hospital .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Serum hemoglobin ( Hb ) concentration one common laboratory test measure pregnant woman ( parturient ) admit vaginal cesarean delivery . The Hb concentration normally measure venous blood sample clinical laboratory use co-oximetry . A new point-of-care pulse co-oximeter , Pronto-7 ( Masimo Corporation , Irvine , CA , USA ) , portable device offer non-invasive quick spot-checking Hb ( SpHb ) . Measurement Pronto-7 take 60 second require transfer blood sample laboratory . In addition SpHb , device provide perfusion index ( PI ) value ( numeric estimation pulse strength measurement site ) , heart rate , oxygen saturation , finger temperature . Potential advantage Pronto-7 include reduced staff work , decrease exposure potential biohazard , reduce pain discomfort patient . A similar technology use Radical-7 pulse co-oximeter ( Masimo Corporation , Irvine , CA , USA ) non-invasive Hb measurement . Radical-7 evaluate human volunteer undergo hemodilution , patient undergo spine surgery , major urological procedure , critically ill patient . However , result regard accuracy technology conflicting .</detailed_description>
