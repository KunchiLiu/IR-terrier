	<brief_title>Levocarnitine Treating Patients With Vismodegib-Associated Muscle Spasms</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine mean number muscle spasm per week levocarnitine arm compare placebo arm . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess intensity muscle spasm per week levocarnitine arm compare placebo arm . II . To assess response related activity daily live psychosocial function 4 week placebo 4 week levocarnitine . III . To assess frequency adverse effect levocarnitine versus placebo . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive levocarnitine orally ( PO ) every 6 hour twice daily ( BID ) week 1-4 . Patients cross-over Arm II week 8-12 . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO every 6 hour BID week 1-4 . Patients cross-over Arm I week 8-12 . After completion study , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
