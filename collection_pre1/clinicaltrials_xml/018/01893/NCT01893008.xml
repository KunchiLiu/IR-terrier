	<brief_title>Preoperative Inspiratory Muscle Training Esophageal Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Esophageal resection associate high incidence postoperative pulmonary pneumonia . Numbers 30 % report literature . Postoperative complication result prolonged hospital stay increase health care cost . In cardiac surgery patient reduction postoperative pneumonia 50 % report result preoperative inspiratory muscle train program . While surgical center IMT already use preoperative phase patient undergoing esophageal resection , effect promise intervention yet investigate randomise control study design large surgical population cardiac surgery . Primary objective : Investigate effect preoperative inspiratory muscle train program incidence postoperative pneumonia patient undergoing esophageal resection . Study design : Prospective multicenter randomise controlled clinical trial . Main study parameters/endpoints : A significant reduction incidence postoperative pneumonia .</detailed_description>
