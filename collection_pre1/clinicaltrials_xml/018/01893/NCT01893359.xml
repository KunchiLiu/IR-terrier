	<criteria>1 . Be least 18 year age , male female , race ; 2 . Provide write informed consent sign HIPAA form ; 3 . Willingness ability follow instruction comply schedule study visit ; 4 . Undergoing bilateral LASIK correction hyperopia hyperopic astigmatism ; 5 . Intended treatment &gt; +2.0 diopter ( D ) &lt; +6.0 D MRSE hyperopia hyperopia astigmatism , +6.0 D spherical component 5.0 D astigmatic component ( refraction measure spectacle plane ) ; 6 . Bilateral physiologic hyperopia ; 7 . For female capable become pregnant , agree urine pregnancy test perform visit 2 prior treatment ; must lactate , must agree use medically acceptable form birth control least one week prior visit 2 continue use method one month follow treatment . Acceptable form birth control spermicide barrier , oral contraceptive , injectable implantable method contraception , transdermal contraceptive , intrauterine device , surgical sterilization partner . For nonsexually active female , abstinence consider acceptable form birth control . Women consider capable become pregnant include female experience menarche experience menopause ( define amenorrhea great 12 consecutive month ) undergo successful surgical sterilization ( e.g . hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) ; 8 . Best spectacle correct visual acuity ( BSCVA ) 70 letter ETDRS chart ; 9 . Difficulty maintain uncorrected visual acuity ( UCVA ) least 70 letter ETDRS chart evidence need constant contact lens spectacle wear ; 10 . Less 0.75 D spherical equivalent difference cycloplegic manifest refraction ; 11 . Stable refraction ( difference 0.50 D less MRSE ) last 12 month , objectively document ( previous clinical record , prescription , etc . ) , exclusive change determine investigator due unmasking latent hyperopia ; 12 . Normal corneal topography , judge investigator ; 13 . Removal contact lens require period time prior screen refraction : 1 . Soft 3 Days 2 . Soft Toric 2 Weeks 3 . Rigid gas permeable 2 Weeks 14 . Contact Lens Wearers Only : Must demonstrate stable refraction ( difference 0.50 D less ) determine MRSE two consecutive exam date perform least 7 day apart . A contact lens wearer define someone worn contact lenses either eye last 30 day . 1 . Contraindications , sensitivity know allergy use test article ( ) component ; 2 . If female , pregnant , nurse plan pregnancy positive urine pregnancy test Visit 2 prior treatment course study ; 3 . Eyes aphakic ; 4 . Eyes pseudophakic UV block lens implant ; 5 . Acute chronic disease illness would increase operative risk confound outcome study ( e.g. , dry eye , immuno compromise , connective tissue disease , clinically significant atopic disease , diabetes , etc . ) ; 6 . Systemic medication may confound outcome study increase risk subject , include limited steroid , antimetabolite , etc . ; 7 . Ocular condition may predispose subject future complication , example : 1 . History evidence active inactive corneal disease ( e.g. , herpes simplex keratitis , herpes zoster keratitis , recurrent corneal erosion syndrome , corneal dystrophy , etc . ) ; 2 . Evidence retinal vascular disease ; 3 . Keratoconus keratoconus suspect ; 4 . Glaucoma glaucoma suspect exam finding and/or family history ; 8 . Previous intraocular corneal surgery include prior refractive surgery might confound outcome study increase risk subject ; 9 . An increase risk develop strabismus posttreatment ; 10 . Subjects nystagmus condition would prevent steady gaze treatment diagnostic test ; 11 . Taking supplement contain Vitamin C ( ascorbic acid ) within 1 week crosslinking treatment ; 12 . Corneal thickness &lt; 470 micron measure Pentacam ; 13 . The Investigator may exclude discontinue subject sound medical reason ; 14 . The subject participate investigational drug device study within 30 day screen concurrently enrol another investigational drug device study .</criteria>
