	<brief_title>The Influence Posture Airway Diameter , Resistance Airflow Distribution Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Many respiratory disease require physiotherapeutic treatment focus clearance excessive mucus airway . The underlying physiological hypothesis mucus clearance technique effective base development optimal expiratory airflow velocity applies shear force mucus inner surface airway . These shear force eventually lead displacement mucus central airway could evacuated.To accomplish optimal velocity expiratory airflow , necessary decrease airway diameter hence increase airflow velocity . In word , airway diameter resistance important factor take account mucus clearance technique . In many mucus clearance technique , postural position use facilitate clearance . Clinical trial patient chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) cystic fibrosis combine clearance technique different postural position show effective . The influence posture evaluate lateral decubitus position result great clearance mucus depend lung . The author suggest may due good deflation depend lung favor 3 force : gravity , mediastinum weight pressure abdominal viscera infra lateral lung . Deflation lung lead decrease lung volume , also result decrease airway diameter . Nevertheless , know extend decrease diameter occur lateral position . Furthermore , optimal expiratory flow must retain underlie lung low lung volume . These regional change underlie lung measure example classic lung function test since test sensitive enough . Indeed , Washko et . al . find significant change overall residual volume ( RV ) , total lung capacity ( TLC ) vital capacity ( VC ) different position healthy subject . However , Functional respiratory imaging ( FRI ) able assess regional change healthy subject . This 3D imaging technique combination computational fluid dynamic ( CFD ) accurate calculate regional change airway diameter , volume resistance . In addition , repetitive FRI measure able assess lobar expansion , indirect measure airflow distribution specific part lung .</detailed_description>
