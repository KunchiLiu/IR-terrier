	<brief_summary>Acute chronic anemia continue associate increased mortality number clinical setting , include cardiac non-cardiac surgery . However , `` We clinical measure let u know impend insufficient oxygenation anemia progress '' ( R.B . Weiskopf ) . The current proposal base experimental clinical data suggest plasma methemoglobin ( MetHb ) may sensitive biomarker tissue hypoxia `` anemic stress '' surgical patient . Hypothesis : Increased methemoglobin biomarker tissue hypoxia acute anemia . Primary Objective : To demonstrate direct relationship decrease Hb increase MetHb patient undergo acute hemodilution cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute chronic anemia continue associate increased mortality number clinical setting , include cardiac non-cardiac surgery . 1-6 However , recently state one pioneer anemia research ; Dr. R.B . Weiskopf : `` We clinical measure let u know impend insufficient oxygenation anemia progress '' .7 Toward achieve goal , develop experimental model define adaptive mechanism maintain oxygen homeostasis acute anemia . Our research identify increase nitric oxide ( NO ) production nitric oxide synthesis ( NOSs ) may important survival mechanism acute anemia.3 ; 8 ; 9 Experimental data suggest nNOS may promote survival maintain oxygen ( O2 ) homeostasis acute anemia.10 Resultant increase nitric oxide ( NO ) contribute adaptive cell signal mechanism also increase oxidation hemoglobin ( Hb ) methemoglobin ( MetHb ) .3 In addition , oxygen extraction result increase level deoxyhemoglobin propose act nitrite ( NO2- ) reductase generate additional bioactive NO , thereby promote vasodilation hypoxic vascular beds.11-15 Thus , one mechanism , increase MetHb may indicative hemoglobin desaturation , tissue hypoxia activation adaptive tissue response anemia . These response may identify threshold local tissue hypoxia `` anemic stress '' . In attempt determine mechanism active human perform retrospective study patient undergo cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) heart surgery determine plasma MetHb increase Hb decrease CPB . We observe inverse relationship Hb MetHb independent red blood cell transfusion exogenous nitrate use</detailed_description>
