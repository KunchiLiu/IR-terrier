	<brief_summary>Our recent prospective randomize control study compare single-port vs. multiport laparoscopic total extraperitoneal inguinal herniorraphy ( NCT 01660048 ) demonstrate superiority single-port technique reduce post-op pain/analgesic requirement , quick return work/normal physical activity improve cosmetic scar score . During study patient underwent initial extraperitoneal dissection distension balloon . However , balloon cost AU $ 380 per device represent significant percentage overall cost procedure ( hospital/operating room cost approximately AU $ 2500 unilateral laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair ) especially unilateral inguinal herniorraphy perform . The European Hernia Society Guidelines encourage use distension balloon initial distension/dissection extraperitoneal space especially learn curve . This recommendation arise fact conventional multiport repair umbilical port allow insertion laparoscope extraperitoneal space easily dissect scope , especially patient well-developed linea alba extend pubic symphysis , camera , use dissection device , would become smudged would repeatedly withdraw cleaning . Yet must occur since extraperitoneal space must dissect midline sufficiently safe insertion two additional 5 mm port insertion dissect instrument order complete extraperitoneal space dissection repair . With single incision laparoscopic surgery use Triport™ system ensure port place direct vision extraperitoneal space scope two dissect instrument safely inserted outset . In way extraperitoneal space dissect direct vision . The balloon dissection essentially blind dissection even though balloon distension observe scope , incorrect tissue plane enter ie dissection occur pre-peritoneal fascia expose nerve groin potential risk nerve damage entrapment . This argument surgeon practise transabdominal preperitoneal inguinal hernia repair use justify superior technique TEP repair , TAPP repair , peritoneum carefully dissect free leave underlying preperitoneal fascia intact . While use balloon , 25 `` pump '' air use insufflation , create significant space place two 5 mm port also create significant extraperitoneal dissection usually lateral space hernia sac need dissect always possible . In patient previous low abdominal surgery include previous anterior inguinal herniorraphy ( especially mesh plug use ) balloon dissention normally judicious one predict whether significant peritoneal even bowel adhesion . Consequently , case , balloon distension normally confine area inferior umbilical port superior pubic symphysis enough extraperitoneal dissection place two 5 mm trocars . Usually mean use 5 pump air distension balloon placement two 5 mm trocars . Then dissection extraperitonealy space direct vision take place . The use distension balloon case represent enormous waste resource since AU $ 380 spend create enough space place two 5 mm port hence allow insertion dissect instrument . With Triport+™ port dissect instrument easily place extraperitoneal space dissection begin direct vision hence achieve safe dissection TAPP surgeon claim perform . In study aim look safety efficacy telescopic vs. balloon dissection prospectively compare similar former group patient one previously undergone single-port inguinal herniorraphy balloon dissection previous study ( NCT 01660048 ) . All patient surgical treatment groin hernia St Luke 's Holroyd Private Hospitals subject careful assessment study . All patient request report immediately problem .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Study Comparing Telescopic v . Balloon Dissection Single Incision Laparoscopic Inguinal Herniorraphy ( SILTELESCOPIC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study compare extraperitoneal dissection single-port laparoscopic total extraperitoneal repair inguinal/femoral hernia use traditional balloon dissection telescopic dissection technique . Laparoscopic hernia repair first introduced 1990 . The uptake rate slow start 1994 9.7 % inguinal hernia perform laparoscopically However , 2012 , figure stand 48 % Australia-wide . ( www.medicareaustralia.gov.au ) . Indeed , State New South Wales figure stand 51 % , mean common operation perform inguinal hernia State . Up 2009 , laparoscopic hernia repair involve insertion 3 port : 10mm port infra-umbilical region camera via 2 cm incision 2 x 5 mm work port usually midline dissect instrument via 2 x 10 mm incision . These port call secondary trocars usually sharp . Their insertion potential cause bowel vascular injury . The European Hernia Society guideline ( www.herniaweb.org ) treatment inguinal hernia show ( conventional ) endoscopic technique associate high rate port-site hernias visceral injury especially learn curve period . A recent study 37,000 gynaecological laparoscopy US show bowel injury rate 0.16 % ; third lead death patient . 22 % bowel injury result insertion secondary trocars ( www.danaise.com/vascular_and_bowel_injuries_duri.htm ) . Another report large hernia centre US show first 300 transabdominal preperitoneal ( TAPP ) repair 2 bowel injury ( one bladder injury ) observe . Indeed , investigator change technique TEP repair also observe 2 bowel injury ( one bladder injury ) first 300 TEP repair . ( www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11178763 ) Therefore bowel vascular injury laparoscopic surgery real often report . Single incision laparoscopic surgery , instrument place single port , primary aim prevent vascular bowel injury use completely blunt trocars case SILS™ port . The first case laparoscopic TEP repair report 2009 . Since numerous report confirm safety efficacy single-port technique . The principle author , Dr Hanh Tran , perform single incision laparoscopic hernia repair since October 2009 . To date , perform excess 600 case excellent result confirm recently complete prospective randomize control study compare single-port vs. multiport laparoscopic inguinal herniorraphy ( NCT 01660048 ) achieve successful cure hernia , complication include wound infection , reduce post-op pain/analgesic requirement , early return work/physical activity , high patient satisfaction excellent cosmetic result . However achieve significant additional cost use single port . These cost reimburse medical insurance company . The single-port technique allow direct insertion dissect instrument extraperitoneal space complete dissection occur direct vision suppose blind dissection balloon dissector two 5mm port insert multiport TEP repair . It propose 51 ( ) patient enrol study compare previous 51 patient previous RCT balloon dissection . The single-port TEP inguinal herniorraphy exactly procedures except telescopic technique dissection extraperitoneal dissection do direct vision without use balloon dissector . The main disadvantage single port technique relative loss triangulation principle author show overcome use longer small laparoscope ( Holroyd Private Hospital buy two specifically purpose ) , different dissect technique increase experience . Therefore , surgeon experience technique operation success compromise inadequate dissection . The author ( performed 2500 TEP repair past 13 year ) believe learn curve single-port TEP hernia repair highly experienced TEP surgeon around 25-50 ie number operation time approach standard three port TEP repair show recently complete RCT . He perform excess 600 Single-port Laparoscopic hernia repair since October 2009 . Therefore success operation patient either arm study compromise lack experience . The follow patient different follow protocol Sydney Hernia Specialists/Clinic . This standard follow consistent normal clinical practice . In summary , goal simple . ( ) To perform single-port laparoscopic TEP inguinal herniorraphy telescopic extraperitoneal dissection ; ( ii ) To assess efficacy new telescopic dissection technique rigorous scientific manner ; ( iii ) To report unexpected problem complication ; ( iv ) To follow patient treat laparoscopically ensure single-port technique balloon dissection telescopic dissection good result well term cure hernia ( absence recurrence hernia ) less complication well cosmetic result achieve traditional 3-ports technique use ; ( v ) ass outcomes patient undergo telescopic dissection vs. balloon dissection .</detailed_description>
