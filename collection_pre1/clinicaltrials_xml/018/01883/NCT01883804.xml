	<brief_summary>Type 1 Diabetes autoimmune condition segment immune system cause destruction insulin produce cell pancreas , leave individual impaired ability control blood glucose level . Currently cure Type 1 Diabetes treatment involve lifelong insulin administration careful monitor blood glucose level . Long-term complication like cardiovascular disease , nerve damage , retina damage , may result . Previous study show improvement control blood glucose reduce risk long-term complication . Residual insulin production , typically within first year follow diagnosis , help reduce individual 's need supplement insulin injection pump . This effect help maintain body 's ability regulate blood glucose level reduce need external insulin . Methyldopa , Aldomet , approve Food Drug Administration commonly use treat high blood pressure . This drug approve several decade show safe effective . This drug identify researcher able block communication two important type immune cell ; play critical role autoimmune process Type 1 Diabetes . The investigator hypothesize Methyldopa , 6 week treatment period , block communication possibly slow destruction insulin produce cell . The investigator hope assess appropriate safe dose achieve effect , along drug 's ability maintain insulin production blood glucose control .</brief_summary>
