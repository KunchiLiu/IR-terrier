	<brief_summary>An estimate 40 % patient mental health treatment setting engage hazardous alcohol and/or drug use . One model intervention show effective medical setting reduce alcohol use and/or promote engagement addiction treatment screening , brief intervention , referral treatment ( SBIRT ) . Despite effectiveness SBIRT risky alcohol use medical setting , research effectiveness SBIRT mental health treatment setting . Given proportionately large number mental health patient also engage hazardous substance use , research need find appropriate effective substance use intervention patient setting . The propose study use randomize controlled trial examine extent World Health Organization 's SBIRT model , ASSIST ( Alcohol , Smoking , Substance Involvement Screening Test ) associate brief behavioral intervention , lead reduction substance prevalent mental health setting : alcohol , cannabis stimulant ( i.e. , cocaine methamphetamine ) . The study also examine effect SBIRT improvement psychiatric symptom , improve quality life whose level substance misuse indicate need treatment , initiation engagement SUD treatment service . Eligible participant mental health patient report past year use cannabis stimulant least one heavy drinking day past year . Mental health patient ( N=750 ) meet eligibility criterion enrol randomly assign either SBIRT intervention condition health education attention control condition . Participants assess baseline substance use , psychiatric symptom quality life . Each participant assess 3- , 6- 12- month follow point alcohol drug use , involvement SUD treatment service , severity psychiatric symptom quality life . If successful study yield valuable new knowledge effectiveness SBIRT mental health treatment setting promote improve well mental health patient . Further , study provide evidence effectiveness SBIRT reduce illicit drug use . Results research use basis broad dissemination SBIRT mental health setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Research Design Methods The propose 5-year study randomize , control trial screening , brief intervention , referral treatment ( SBIRT ) alcohol , cannabis stimulant use mental health treatment setting . These 3 substance choose focus propose study ( ) US alcohol cannabis common substance use individual serious mental illness general population1 ( b ) stimulant use ( particular , methamphetamine ) significant public health threat US . 31,32 The SBIRT model test two-group design eligible participant ( N=750 ) randomly assign either SBIRT intervention condition ( N=375 ) control condition ( N=375 ) offer informational leaflet . The participant comprise male female mental health patient positive pre-screen risk develop substance use disorder . The performance site study publicly-funded mental health clinic Ventura County , California .

The SBIRT condition include WHO 's Alcohol , Smoking , Substance Involvement Screening Test ( ASSIST ) accompany brief intervention use motivational interview technique provide feedback , emphasize personal responsibility , give advice , provide menu option , convey empathy , promote self-efficacy.33,34 All participant SBIRT condition complete ASSIST interview . Based result ASSIST , participant score moderate-risk range alcohol , cannabis stimulant immediately receive 15-minute brief intervention . Participants score high-risk range one substances receive brief intervention referral substance abuse treatment facility assessment rehabilitative care . Referral treatment active intervention describe 'Description Study Conditions ' . We expect patient score low-risk range ASSIST pre-screen study ( describe 'Recruitment Participants Randomization ' ) exclude individual . In event individual enroll study score low-risk range ASSIST , data exclude analysis count toward target enrollment study . The baseline assessment occur prior randomization . Research assistants administer assessment in-person clinic . Clinical social worker ( English Spanish speaking ) conduct SBIRT intervention patient . Follow-up assessment occur 3- , 6- 12-months post baseline . Project Timeline Table 1 summarize main study activity across 5 year project . The research clinical facility place , start-up period 6 month need complete IRB application approval process , develop data collection template , train staff finalize study protocols procedure . As show Table 1 , subject recruitment begin month 7 extend 36 month . The timetable project base enrollment 30 participant per month . This rate recruitment feasible base consultation mental health treatment sit allow recruitment 750 participant study . As Table 1 show , timeline provide adequate time collect 12-month follow-up data conduct data analysis . Table 1 : Project Timeline Months 1-6 : Training &amp; start-up activity Months 7-42 : Recruitment , SBIRT intervention , &amp; follow-up activity . 30 Participants recruited/month ( N=1080 ) Months 43-54 : Complete follow-up activity Months 55-60 : Data Analysis , Report Writing</detailed_description>
