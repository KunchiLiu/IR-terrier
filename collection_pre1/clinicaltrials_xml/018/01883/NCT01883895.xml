	<brief_title>Exercise-induced Hypoaglesia After Comparative Forms Exercise</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Known change hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis , well neurotransmitter system , lead alteration peripheral central nociception acute chronic stress . Exercise one example physiologic stress . Exercise , various form , show exert effect pain attenuation . Several study demonstrate post-exercise reduction pain rating , increase pain threshold well attenuation pain-related increase motor evoke potential . This phenomenon refer exercise-induced analgesia ( EIA ) , perhaps accurately , exercise-induced hypoalgesia ( EIH ) . Exercise high intensity longer duration robust evidence support role EIH . This true long-duration aerobic training well high-intensity anaerobic training . This type activity , however , may practical type activity prescribe clinical population , especially people painful condition , due decrease condition tolerance . Beyond long-duration and/or high-intensity aerobic exercise , grow evidence support use form intensity exercise may induce EIH . Alternative form exercise , isometric stabilization , show decrease pain population patient low back pain . Koltyn Arbogast investigate acute effect exercise pain perception find single bout resistance exercise 75 % maximum intensity produce significant increase pain threshold reduction pain ratings.11 EIH also occur follow short duration ( e.g. , 1.5-5 min ) low intensity ( e.g. , 15-50 % max ) isometric exercise . Along high-intensity training , long-duration/low-intensity isometric contraction also find produce analgesic response . Studies suggest different post-exercise pain response chronic pain population compare healthy control , however question still remain influence various exercise intensity , protocol type contraction . Slater , et al examine effect eccentric exercise versus combine concentric-eccentric exercise intensity 30 % max voluntary contraction ( MVC ) show significant increase pain threshold exercise protocol . Their study highlight need research examine change also occur response single exercise mode . To date , study compare EIH produce isometric concentric exercise similar intensity duration . Furthermore , little research EIH compare various form exercise non-exercising control . Similar EIH induce aerobic exercise , relationship anaerobic exercise hypoalgesia indicate common mechanism may relate augmentation central peripheral nervous system modulation descend inhibition well release pain-relieving substance . There possibly orchestra overlie inter-related physiologic , social psychologic mechanism contribute hypoalgesia response exercise . Because confound effect various process possible process , important evaluate specific exercise regimen may provide pain relief within context clinical practice . Although good evidence long-duration aerobic , high-intensity exercise modulate pain , strategy may difficult apply clinical setting due disable nature painful condition . Patients condition may apt comply short duration exercise less intensity . No study date specifically address difference pain response compare EIH follow anaerobic exercise use concentric isometric training bout well non-exercising control condition . Investigation EIH study improve understand nociceptive change follow therapeutic exercise clinical setting . Aim 1 : To examine change pain follow two different type exercise ( isometric versus concentric contraction ) . Hypothesis 1a : Pain significantly low follow type exercise comparison non-exercising control condition . Currently , unclear whether pain response differ two exercise condition since previous research conduct area . Aim 2 : To examine whether men woman differ pain response follow exercise type . Hypothesis 2 : There sex difference EIH response . We propose test EIH healthy subject measure potential difference pressure pain intensity rating isometric versus concentric contraction well control condition . This study seek determine two exercise produce EIH extent difference hypoalgesic response . Primary outcome : Pain intensity rating : Subjects rate pain intensity use 0 ( pain ) 100 ( intense pain imaginable ) pain rating scale application validate pressure stimulator immediately prior , exercise . Secondary outcome : Pain threshold : Subjects press button attach timer view subject pressure stimulus first become painful . This utilize protocol recognize validated measurement pain threshold . We aim examine effect exercise-induced hypoalgesia healthy subject . We utilize three-treatment crossover design subject undergo two exercise protocol well control protocol different date . In order essentially eliminate carry-over effect , elect use washout period &gt; 48h ensure adequate time relief muscle pain fatigue . Subjects first test one repetition voluntary maximum contraction ( MVC ) type exercise test day . Subjects allow rest 10-15 minute review exercise protocol fill questionnaires include demographic , State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Pain Catastrophizing Scale . Immediately prior exercise testing , record baseline pulse rate blood pressure reading . Pain rating threshold pressure stimulus , describe , measure . Subjects begin exercise trial . Testing randomized subject perform protocols either ; non-exercising control , concentric exercise isometric exercise test use possible treatment sequence . Stratification random sample do use block randomization scheme . For concentric testing , subject perform 5 set 20 rep 30 % MVC . When undergo isometric exercise , subject perform 5 set sustain muscle contraction use duration time take complete one set 20 rep ( determine pilot study prior initiation study ) . There one-minute rest period set . Concentric test utilize dumbbell elbow flexion exercise . Isometric test perform use hand-grip dynamometer . Each exercise perform dominant arm/hand . Following exercise , subject also rate perceive exertion perceive muscle pain use Borg Scale Cook Scale , respectively . These widely accept validated measure perceive exertion muscle pain . The control condition consist quiet rest duration exercise condition . At end session , subject fill two questionnaire : State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Situational Catastrophizing Scale . The validated questionnaire choose complete intake post-testing help identify confound emotional behavioral trait may influence pain threshold rating . Pain test conduct use Forgioni-Barber pressure-pain stimulator deliver 3000-gm force middle digit non-dominant middle finger 120 second . During stimulation , subject press button attach timer pressure stimulus first become painful ( pain threshold ) also rate perceive pain intensity use 0-100 numeric pain rating scale 20 second interval 2 minute exposure pressure stimulus . This validated protocol use previous research investigator study . Risks : Subjects insert middle forefinger chute Forgioni-Barber pain stimulator non-fixed Lucite edge contact finger constant application pressure 3 kg weight . This device create stimulus easy apply produce distinct pain sensation rapid onset offset . It produce tissue damage psychological physical health risk , subject able stop stimulus time . The pain intensity repeatable readily discriminable throughout stimulus application . Previous research demonstrate Forgioni-Barber pressure-pain stimulator device , use described procedure , safe device produce painful stimulus cause tissue damage injury . No significant adverse side effect experience expect exercise pain stimulus . Temporary discomfort expect application pain stimulus , however resolve upon removal stimulus . There permanent consequence expect testing procedure . If subject experience excessive discomfort time pain testing , immediately remove stimulus . The subject may withdraw test time research . With exercise , slight risk muscle soreness strain . We mitigate risk muscle strain instructing subject stop exercise feel over-straining begin feel discomfort perform activity . The investigator also immediately available assist , need , subject experience discomfort exercise session . It well know repetitive contraction possibility induce delay onset muscle soreness ( DOMS ) . This known occur often eccentric exercise . Previous research show effect DOMS use intend protocol describe washout period 24 hour adequate eccentric loading . 32 healthy normotensive male female age range 18 40 year recruit community .</detailed_description>
