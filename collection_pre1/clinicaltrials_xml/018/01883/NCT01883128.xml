	<brief_summary>Radiotherapy common form prostate cancer treatment UK . In one four men , radiotherapy fail control cancer . These men offer hormonal treatment significant side effect . Few men offer treatment surgery , HIFU cryotherapy . Only half men cancer free 5 year . The investigator believe due poor imaging test CT Bone scan accurately detect whether cancer come back inside outside prostate . Also radiotherapy damage tissue surround prostate affect tissue heal example surgery . Treating cancer prostate ( focal treatment ) rather whole prostate may limit damage cause few side-effects . The investigator want see new image test well identify cancer spread outside prostate area cancer inside prostate . Our new test whole-body MRI ( distant disease ) MRI guide biopsy ( MRI-TB ) ( local disease ) . First , investigator compare result whole-body MRI exist image test ( bone-scan , choline PET/CT ) try find distant spread . Second , investigator compare result MRI-TB detailed accurate biopsy prostate call template prostate mapping show u aggressive cancer . Third , cancer confine prostate , investigator treat men use focal salvage therapy HIFU cryotherapy . The investigator believe new imaging test could better identify benefit early hormone treatment benefit local salvage treatment . Our study may help justify carry large trial look good treatment control cancer medium long-term .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . Previous external beam radiotherapy without neoadjuvant/adjuvant hormone therapy 2 . Biochemical failure define Phoenix criterion ( PSA nadir + 2ng/ml ) 3 . Men consider local salvage treatment radiorecurrent disease 4 . Life expectancy 5 year 1 . Have take form hormone ( except 5alpha reductase inhibitor ) within previous 6 month 2 . Unable MRI scan define standard care practice 3 . Metallic implant likely cause artefact reduce scan quality 4 . PSA double time 3 month less 5 . PSA value 20ng/ml great 6 . Prior prostate biopsy follow biochemical failure 7 . Any prior local intervention prostate ( e.g. , laser/electrical resection incision , cryotherapy , HIFU , ablative modality , radiotherapy , prostate injection therapy symptom cancer control ) 8 . Unable general regional anaesthesia 9 . Unable give inform consent</criteria>
