	<brief_summary>It hypothesise inhaled mannitol 400 mg b.d . lead significant improvement absolute change percentage predict FEV1 baseline follow eight-weeks trial treatment compare treatment inhale placebo b.d . Any improvement FEV1 consider clinically meaningful ; however , trial set threshold 3 % purpose determine appropriate sample size statistical power whilst retain trial feasibility orphan disease population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Crossover Trial Determining Efficacy Dry Powder Mannitol Improve Lung Function Subjects Aged 6-17 Years</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Drug Name : Dry powder mannitol inhalation Phase : 2 Indication : Paediatric adolescent cystic fibrosis Trial Centres : Multicentre Sponsor : Pharmaxis Limited , 20 Rodborough Road , Frenchs Forest , NSW 2086 Australia Trial Duration : 27 week Number Subjects : 160 Trial Design : Randomised , multicentre , double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover Primary Objective : To determine effect eight week twice-daily treatment inhaled dry powder mannitol lung function ( FEV1 ) subject CF age six seventeen year Dosage Administration : Trial drug administer via dry powder inhaler . - Mannitol 400 mg b.d . 8 week follow 8-week washout follow placebo b.d . 8 week ; - Placebo b.d . 8 week follow 8-week washout follow mannitol 400 mg b.d . 8 week . Statistical Methods : - The primary secondary efficacy analysis base upon modify Grizzle model crossover design . Absolute relative change baseline percentage predict FEV1 FVC analyse . The absolute change percentage predict lung function ( FEV1 FVC ) primary focus . Changes FEF25-75 also analyse . - Safety data analyse descriptively ( listing summary table ) .</detailed_description>
