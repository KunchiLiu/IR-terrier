	<brief_summary>Most leading academic center include Baylor College Medicine ( BCM ) perform deep brain stimulation surgery awake patient use microelectrode record guide final electrode placement . Microelectrode record mean analyze electrical activity brain , assess whether find target deep brain stimulator electrode . However , evidence exists microelectrode record improves patient outcomes . The use microelectrode record extend duration surgery evidence suggest microelectrode recording may increase risk bleed brain surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>MER Versus MRI Guidance DBS Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients randomize Group 1 undergo DBS implantation awake . On morning surgery , patient undergo placement stereotactic head frame local anesthesia . A CT scan perform stereotactic planning , fuse preoperatively obtain MRI . The coordinate plan target select use standard coordinate base know relationship anterior commissure - posterior commissure plane , along anatomical structure visualize MRI scan . The surgery perform patient awake . Two simultaneous microelectrode track use DBS electrode implant . If neither electrophysiological recording adequate , additional MER track may perform . Macro-stimulation also use evaluate clinical efficacy stimulation induce side effect . The DBS electrode place track optimal electrophysiological clinical finding . The identical procedure follow contralateral side . A post-operative stereotactic CT scan perform assess lead location evaluate intracranial bleeding . Patients randomize Group 2 undergo DBS implantation general anesthesia operating room equip intraoperative MRI . Once anesthesia patient place rigid head holder , MRI scan obtain register navigation system . The location hole skull identify , surgery commence . Once hole make skull dura open , second MRI scan obtain identify target . A ceramic stylet stereotactically introduce target , third MRI sequence perform verify stylet indeed desire target . The DBS electrode implant remove stylet . A post-operative stereotactic CT scan perform assess lead location evaluate intracranial bleeding . Neither surgical group undergo investigational procedure . Both surgical technique utilize FDA approve device , use manner FDA approval give . They represent two different , accept , mean implant deep brain stimulator electrode .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Determined candidate subthalamic nucleus ( STN ) Globus pallidus ( GPi ) DBS consensus recommendation multidisciplinary team evidence : 1 . Ability provide inform consent determine preoperative neuropsychological assessment 2 . Optimized medically neurologist expert treatment movement disorder . 3 . Persistent motor symptom effectively control optimal medical management . These symptom may include levodopainduced dyskinesia , tremor , fluctuation effectiveness levodopa throughout day . Dementia Previous intracranial surgery Intracranial tumor Lack ability provide inform consent determine preoperative neuropsychological assessment Medical comorbidities would make patient poor surgical candidate</criteria>
