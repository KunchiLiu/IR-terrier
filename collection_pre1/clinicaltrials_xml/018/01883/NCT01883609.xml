	<brief_summary>This clinical trial healthy volunteer administer experimental malaria vaccine . One group volunteer receive vaccination lead malaria vaccine candidate , RTS , S/AS01 . This vaccine schedule consist 3 dos RTS , S/AS01 interval 4 week dos ( Doses give 0,4 8 week timepoints ) . Another group receive vaccination schedule compose dosage time regimen RTS , S , also receive vaccination ChAd63 ME-TRAP , 2 week first RTS , S follow 8 week later vaccination MVA ME-TRAP ( 2 10 week timepoints ) . The study assess safety vaccination , immune response vaccination . Immune responses measure test blood sample . Volunteers infect malaria mosquito bite , 12 week first vaccination . In addition , group volunteer receive vaccine also infect malaria method . These infection experiment use assess vaccine efficacy : well vaccine act prevent malaria disease . A single volunteer may also infect malaria ; volunteer participate previous trial receive vaccine completely protect malaria disease infection mosquito bite . The RTS , S/AS01 vaccine protein ( RTS , S ) mix adjuvant ( AS01 ) . The ChAd63 ME-TRAP MVA ME-TRAP vaccine call viral vectored vaccine . They make virus modify multiply . The virus extra DNA injection , body make malaria protein ( malaria develop ) , immune system build response malaria without infect . Healthy volunteer recruit England three research site : Oxford , London Southampton .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>The volunteer must satisfy follow criterion eligible study : Healthy adult age 18 45 year . Able willing ( Investigator 's opinion ) comply study requirement . Willing allow investigator discuss volunteer 's medical history General Practitioner . Women : Must practice continuous effective contraception duration study . Agreement refrain blood donation course study least 3 year end involvement study . Written inform consent participate trial . Reachable ( 24/7 ) mobile phone period CHMI completion antimalarial treatment . Willingness take curative antimalaria regimen follow CHMI . For volunteer live Oxford : agreement stay hotel room close trial centre part study ( least day 6.5 post mosquito bite antimalarial treatment complete ) . Answer question inform consent quiz correctly . The volunteer may enter study follow apply : History clinical malaria ( specie ) . Travel malaria endemic region study period within precede six month significant risk malaria exposure . Use systemic antibiotic know antimalarial activity within 30 day CHMI ( e.g . trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole , doxycycline , tetracycline , clindamycin , erythromycin , fluoroquinolones azithromycin ) Receipt investigational product 30 day precede enrolment , plan receipt study period . Prior receipt investigational malaria vaccine investigational vaccine likely impact interpretation trial data . If volunteer Group 1 2 undergo rechallenge , exclusion criterion extend vaccine previously receive VAC055 trial Any confirm suspected immunosuppressive immunodeficient state , include HIV infection ; asplenia ; recurrent , severe infection chronic ( 14 day ) immunosuppressant medication within past 6 month ( inhaled topical steroid allow ) . Use immunoglobulins blood product within 3 month prior enrolment . History allergic disease reaction likely exacerbate component vaccine ( e.g . egg product , Kathon ) malaria infection . Any history anaphylaxis post vaccination . History clinically significant contact dermatitis . History sickle cell anaemia , sickle cell trait , thalassaemia thalassaemia trait haematological condition could affect susceptibility malaria infection . Pregnancy , lactation intention become pregnant study . Use medication know cause prolongation QT interval exist contraindication use Malarone Use medication know potentially clinically significant interaction Riamet Malarone Any clinical condition know prolong QT interval History cardiac arrhythmia , include clinically relevant bradycardia Disturbances electrolyte balance , eg , hypokalaemia hypomagnesaemia Family history congenital QT prolongation sudden death Contraindications use three propose antimalarial medication ; Riamet , Malarone Chloroquine . History cancer ( except basal cell carcinoma skin cervical carcinoma situ ) . History serious psychiatric condition may affect participation study . Any serious chronic illness require hospital specialist supervision . Suspected known current alcohol abuse define alcohol intake great 42 standard UK unit every week . Suspected known inject drug abuse 5 year precede enrolment . Hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) detect serum . Seropositive hepatitis C virus ( antibody HCV ) screening . An estimate , ten year risk fatal cardiovascular disease â‰¥5 % , estimate Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation ( SCORE ) system.77 Positive family history 1st 2nd degree relative &lt; 50 year old cardiac disease . Volunteers unable closely follow social , geographic psychological reason . Any clinically significant abnormal find biochemistry haematology blood test , urinalysis clinical examination . In event abnormal test result , confirmatory repeat test request . Absolute value exclusion confirm abnormal result show Section 17 , Appendix A Any significant disease , disorder , find may significantly increase risk volunteer participation study , affect ability volunteer participate study impair interpretation study data .</criteria>
