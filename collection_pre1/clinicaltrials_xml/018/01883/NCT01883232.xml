	<brief_summary>As dentist , administer anesthetic patient , especially child , prove one difficult part procedure . Pain one common symptom dentistry , serious concern dentist . The pain local anesthetic injection several cause . Of many reason pain site injection , acidity solution think important . This study measure effect add sodium bicarbonate ( buffer ) local anesthetic dental procedure . This commonly use medical application widely use dental setting . Using biochemistry human physiology , one predict buffer lidocaine injection , quicker response analgesia decrease pain administration . I measure effect use several measure device gauge buffer local anesthetic benefit pediatric dental patient reduce time take analgesic effect well decrease pain administration . Along time , I use Wong-Baker Scale ass pain . This scale standard protocol assess pain pediatric population . The pediatric dental population aversion dental procedure associate pain produce procedure . If limiting time take analgesic take effect decrease pain altogether , pediatric patient less likely skip treatment therefore , increase dental health .</brief_summary>
