	<brief_summary>There study compare accuracy , sensitivity specificity HemoCue glucose 201 RT system laboratory gold standard . The incidence cystic fibrosis relate diabetes ( CFRD ) rise significantly patient ' survival improves . Around 30 % cystic fibrosis ( CF ) adult patient CFRD . Early diagnosis CFRD important slow deterioration lung function nutritional status , increase mortality . The oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) accept method detect CFRD Cystic Fibrosis Trust guideline recommend patient CF age twelve year screen annually . The World Health Organisation point due absence specific biological marker define diabetes , plasma glucose estimation remain basis diagnostic criterion . WHO recommend venous plasma glucose standard method measure report glucose concentration blood . However , also recognise widespread use capillary sampling . Although fast value venous capillary plasma glucose , nonfasting state capillary sample give high result venous sample , glucose value require conversion problematic . HemoCue Glucose 201 RT ( HGS 201 RT ) analyzer plasma conversion provide laboratory quality test result point care diagnosis , screen monitoring diabetes mellitus . The analyzer easy use system operate nonlaboratory personnel , also result present immediately , lead significant time resource save . The patient also benefit result immediately instead wait several hour . With immediate result , doctor health care professional provide education , support reassurance , implement care plan , appropriate , early opportunity . The aim study compare clinical accuracy HemoCue Glucose 201 RT laboratory standard method analysis blood glucose concentration oral glucose tolerance test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All CF patient attend annual review require OGTT venous capillary blood sample take simultaneously ( fast = 0 min ) 2 hour ( post glucose load = 120 min ) administration 75 gram Glucose solution orally . The capillary sample analyse immediately use HGS 201 RT . The venous sample collect Fluoride Oxalate tube ( WHO guideline ) send Trust 's laboratory analysis per usual practice .</detailed_description>
