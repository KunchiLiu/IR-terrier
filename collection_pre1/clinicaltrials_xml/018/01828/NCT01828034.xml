	<brief_summary>The purpose study test investigational combination drug bile duct gallbladder cancer . Gemcitabine cisplatin two form chemotherapy commonly use combination treat bile duct gallbladder cancer . The investigator look improve treatment result . They attempt add drug MEK162 treatment plan . MEK162 act block protein call MEK 1/2 help cancer cell grow divide . This study help answer question whether MEK162 helpful drug patient bile duct gallbladder cancer give gemcitabine cisplatin .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Histologically / cytologically verify , nonresectable , recurrent , metastatic biliary tract carcinoma include intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma , extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma gallbladder carcinoma . Combined cholangiocarcinoma hepatocellular carcinoma allow . Patients must measurable disease RECIST 1.1 KPS ≥ 80 % Age ≥ 18 year Adequate bone marrow function define : Hb ≥ 8 g/dl , ANC ≥ 1.5 K/mcL , Platelets ≥ 100 K/mcL Adequate renal function define serum creatinine &lt; 1.6 mg/dl and/or measure creatinine clearance 24hour urine collection ≥ 60 ml/min Adequate hepatic function define total bilirubin ≤ 2 mg/dl , ALT/AST ≤ 5 x ULN . Patients biliary obstruction join bilirubin corrects require limit adequate biliary drainage . Adequate cardiac function define ejection fraction ≥ 45 % determine transthoracic echocardiogram MUGA Patients receive prior local therapy , include limited embolization , chemoembolization , radiofrequency ablation , radiation therapy , eligible provide measurable disease fall outside treatment field within field show increase ≥ 20 % size . Prior local therapy must complete least 4 week prior baseline scan Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 7 day prior study treatment Men woman childbearing potential must willing consent use effective contraception treatment least 3 month thereafter . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Any previous chemotherapy , biologic therapy , investigational agent , except adjuvant therapy single agent and/or radiosensitizing agent limit 5fluorouracil gemcitabine . Patient must complete adjuvant therapy less six month prior accrual . Evidence another active cancer may influence patient outcome determine Principal Investigator ( PI ) coPrincipal Investigator ( coPI ) , except nonmelanoma skin carcinoma , melanoma insitu , insitu carcinoma cervix curatively treat , treat superficial bladder cancer , adenocarcinoma prostate surgically treat posttreatment PSA nondetectable . Known brain metastasis primary central nervous system tumor seizures well control standard medical therapy . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Known HIV positive patient Significant cardiovascular disease include congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association Class II high ) active angina pectoris . History myocardial infarction within 6 month . History stroke transient ischemic attack within 6 month . Clinically significant peripheral vascular disease . Major surgical procedure within 4 week . Uncontrolled infection . Known suspected allergy gemcitabine cisplatin Pregnant ( positive pregnancy test ) Breastfeeding discontinue nurse mother treat clinical trial . Any condition impair patient 's ability swallow whole pill Malabsorption problem may limit inhibit absorption MEK 162 Patients history current know evidence central serous retinopathy ( CSR ) , retinal vein occlusion ( RVO ) ophthalmopathy baseline would consider risk factor CSR RVO . History organ bone marrow transplant .</criteria>
