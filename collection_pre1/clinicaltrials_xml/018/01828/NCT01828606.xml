	<brief_summary>Although doubt need compression therapy lymphoedema , investigate much detail much pressure need get optimum volume reduction . New research suggest obviously upper pressure limit beyond increase pressure seem contra productive . This upper limit around 30-40 mm Hg initial pressure exert inelastic bandage upper around 50-60 mm Hg low extremity . This study design investigate effect pressure % volume reduction leg lymphoedema 2 bandage comparable product property ( slippage , stiffness , etc . ) , differ pressure exert limb .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Lymphoedema chronic swell caused regional accumulation protein-rich fluid tissue due compromise lymphatic system . This may present primary lymphoedema , define congenital abnormality lymphatic vessel secondary lymphoedema , acquire various insult lymphatic system , malignancy , trauma , surgery irradiation . It frequently see lymph node dissection , surgery radiation therapy cancer treatment , notably breast cancer . In United Kingdom large prevalence study undertaken Moffatt et al rate 1.33 per 1000 population identify . In general , prevalence increase age high woman men . One function lymphatic system remove fluid interstitial tissue return venous circulation . compression therapy cornerstone treatment lymphoedema Much evidence compression work base research venous disease , extrapolate lymphoedema . Hence , compression bandage system available market use treatment venous disease time lymphoedema . This upper limit around 30-40 mm Hg initial pressure exert inelastic bandage upper around 50-60 mm Hg low extremity . This also state International Lymphoedema Framework position document `` Compression Therapy : A position document compression bandaging '' . 100 subject leg lymphoedema enrol study . The duration study one week participant . All participant receive compression therapy 3M Coban 2 3M Coban 2 Lite respectively accord randomisation list . The goal present study gain information % volume reduction lymphoedematous legs relation pressure .</detailed_description>
