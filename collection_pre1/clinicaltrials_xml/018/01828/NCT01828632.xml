	<detailed_description>Background . Morbidly obese patient show increase risk hypoxemia postoperative period result high incidence postoperative pulmonary complication prolong hospital length stay compare normal weight subject . Mechanisms involved predisposition morbidly obese patient develop physiopathologic scheme include great impairment respiratory mechanic induce general anesthesia paralysis -greater reduction pulmonary chest compliance high airway resistance- increment ventilatory requirement . That lead increase work breathing ( WOB ) oxygen consumption ( VO2 ) . These effect exaggerate patient undergo laparoscopic surgery direct effect pneumoperitoneum pulmonary mechanic . In addition , morbidly obese patient respiratory muscle show reduction strength endurance probably cause fatty tissular infiltration exacerbate inflammatory response usually observe patient . Respiratory physical therapy show effective reduce postoperative pulmonary complication , postoperative treatment give preoperatively . When apply postoperatively respiratory physiotherapy prove able expand pulmonary volume improve arterial oxygenation , lead decrease postoperative pulmonary complication , specially abdominal surgery . In specific set morbidly obese patient submit bariatric surgery , postoperative inspiratory muscle training ( IMT ) improve inspiratory muscle strength endurance allow early recovery pulmonary airflow . There scanty data result apply respiratory physiotherapy preoperative period . However prove able reduce postoperative incidence postoperative pulmonary complication different setting : ( 1 ) In patient thoracic surgery , ( 2 ) In patient undergo CABG surgery , specially consider high risk pulmonary complication ( 3 ) upper abdominal surgery . At knowledge study aim determine wether preoperative respiratory physiotherapy could improve postoperative respiratory function morbidly obese patient publish . The objective study evaluate effect preoperative respiratory physical therapy program postoperative respiratory function morbidly obese patient undergo bariatric laparoscopic surgery . Fifty morbid obese patient ( BMI≥40 % ) consecutively schedule laparoscopic bariatric surgery consider eligible . All subject treat surgical team submit anesthetic procedure . All patient inform objective intervention study sign informed consent form . The protocol approve local Human Research Ethics Committee . The sample size calculate use repeat measure PaO2/FiO2 ratio postoperative period primary endpoint . Assuming increment 25 % parameter ( effect size 0.25 ) would clinical importance , alfa error probability 0.05 power 0.95 , require sample size 44 patient obtain . To account attrition proportion 15 % add , reach total sample size 50 patient . The calculation carry mean GPower 3.1.5 application statistic . After inclusion , informed consent procedure , evaluation baseline characteristic , study patient randomly blindly divide two group : control group ( CG ) intervention group ( RPT ) . Randomization do computer generate randomization table individual close seal envelope . An investigator blind allocation sequence pick consecutive allocation envelope consecutive participant . Surgery schedule day 32 36 baseline day patient . Anesthetic management standardize . Patients receive premedication . In operating room patient place reverse trendelemburg ( RTDL ) position ( 30º ) . Continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) 10 cmH2O apply patient administration oxygen air ( FiO2 0.8 ) 5 minute . After preoxygenation anesthesia induce propofol , 3 mg.kg-1 base ideal body weight ( IBW= X + 0.91* height ( cm ) - 152,4-1 ; X = 50 men ; X= 45 woman ) fentanyl 0,1 microg.kg-1 , follow rocuronium 0.6 mg. kg-1 . Then patient ventilate use pressure support ventilation ( PSV ) inspiratory pressure 10 cmH2O , PEEP 10 cmH2O minimum respiratory rate 10 breaths.min-1 ( Ventilator Engström CS , GE Healthcare , Finland ) . When neuromuscular blockade complete tracheal intubation perform maintain RTDL position 30º . The radial artery cannulate continuous monitor arterial blood pressure arterial blood gas measurement . Anesthesia maintain continuous infusion propofol remifentanil target bispectral index ™ ( XP version 3.0 , Aspect Medical Inc. Norwood , MA ) 40 50 . Neuromuscular blockade maintain rocuronium continuously monitor ( TOF Watch , Bluestar Enterprises , Inc. , Chanhassen , MN ) . Remifentanil discontinue time removal laparoscope . Residual neuromuscular blockade reverse neostigmine , 0.05 mg/kg IV ( IBW ) . Normothermia maintain intraoperatively use force warm air system ( Bair Hugger® , Arizant Healthcare Inc. , Eden Prairie , MN , USA ) . Intraoperative mechanical ventilation group patient . The lung ventilate volume control ventilation ( VCV ) mixture 50 % oxygen air , tidal volume 6 mL.kg-1 ( IBW ) , inspiratory expiratory ratio 1:2 , PEEP 10 cmH2O . Respiratory rate adjust maintain end-tidal carbon dioxide partial pressure ( etCO2 ) 30 35 mmHg . An alveolar recruitment strategy ( ARS ) apply onset pneumoperitoneum . ARS perform increase PEEP increment 5 cmH2O 0 20 cmH2O use pressure control ventilation driving pressure similar airway plateau pressure obtain VCV . Once PEEP reach 20 cmH2O driving pressure augment reach 45 cmH2O . After 10 breath maximal airway pressure , PEEP decrease step 2 cmH2O static compliance respiratory system measure step order determine lung 's closing pressure . Then second ARS apply PEEP set 2 cm H2O high closing pressure . At end surgery new ARS apply , extubation . In case PEEP ARS keep 10 cmH2O extubation . Tracheal extubation perform RTDL position ( 30º ) . Fully monitored patient transfer PACU semi-sitting position , receive high flow oxygen air FiO2 0.5 . Postoperative analgesia first 12 h intravenous paracetamol ( 1 g every 6 h ) intravenous dexketoprofen ( 50 mg every 8 h ) patient . In order know training effect record patient follow-up physical therapy program measure forced vital capacity ( FVC ) , forced expiratory volume 1 second ( FEV1 ) , maximal inspiratory pressure ( PiMAX ) , maximal expiratory pressure ( PeMAX ) ( Datospir-600D , SIBEL SA Spain ) end 30 day train . All patient also instruct trained measurement , aim avoid learn effect study . The measurement perform patient sit position wear nasal clip . PiMAX measure residual volume PeMAX total lung capacity . Five maneuver perform patient , three acceptable register . The high value obtain consider calculation . Spirometry perform accord American Thoracic Society ( ATS ) recommendation , employ mention spirometer ( Datospir-600D ) previously calibrate . Three acceptable curve two replicable one consider , allow maximum eight attempt patient . The choice best value do accord ATS criterion . The obtained value express percentage normal value calculate accord Knudson et al . All functional data obtain investigator , namely , physical therapist .</detailed_description>
