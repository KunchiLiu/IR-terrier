	<detailed_description>This study enroll participant two cohort . Cohort 1 close enrollment . Researchers enrol participant Cohort 2 . Cohort 1 include mother-infant pair HIV-infected pregnant mother receive RAL 400 mg twice daily least 2 week prior delivery continue antiretroviral ( ARV ) drug labor . Mother/infant pair enrol prior delivery , woman follow discharge labor/delivery unit . At delivery , cord blood drawn single blood sample collect woman . All infant undergo medical history , physical examination , blood draw Week 1-2 visit Week 20 visit . Infants meet certain criterion define protocol eligible PK sample birth visit . These infant one blood sample collect 1 5 , 8 14 , 18 24 , 30 36 hour birth . Infants eligible PK sample undergo blood draw 8 14 hour 30 36 hour birth . Optional genotyping UGT1A1 polymorphisms do use dried blood spot filter paper . ( UGT1A1 enzyme primarily responsible RAL metabolism . ) Only infants PK sample genotyping do . No study-specific drug give woman infant study . Women receive RAL clinical indication outside study . Infants receive standard care ARV therapy prevention mother-to-child transmission ( PMTCT ) prescribe primary care physician . Infants follow 20 week birth . Cohort 2 enroll mother-infant pair HIV-infected pregnant woman receive least one dose 400 mg RAL within 2 24 hour prior delivery , infant weigh less equal 2,500 gram birth . Participants take part study procedures participant Cohort 1 , except infant follow 6 week birth .</detailed_description>

Cohort 1 : Maternal Exclusion Criteria Receipt disallow medication within 4 week prior enrollment Cohort 1 : Infant Inclusion Criteria Infants enrol prior delivery infant inclusion criterion . Only infants meet follow criterion eligible PK blood sampling : Infant bear woman receive least 2 week RAL prior delivery continue receive RAL labor prior delivery addition ARV drug Infant birth weight least 2 kg Infant least 37 week gestation delivery Infant receiving disallow medication describe protocol . If medication require infant 's care , infant ineligible PK sampling . Data obtain time introduction disallow medication , infant consider one evaluable 15 infant . Cohort 1 : Infant Exclusion Criteria Infant severe congenital malformation medical condition compatible life would interfere study participation interpretation , judge examine clinician Cohort 2 allow enrollment motherinfant ( MI ) pair two time point : prior within 48 hour delivery . For enrollment prior delivery , mother must meet eligibility criterion ( i.e. , infant eligibility criterion prenatal enrollment ) . However , infant meet eligibility criterion PK blood sampling perform . Infants must PK eligible meet definition evaluable contribute sample size 15 evaluable infant . PK ineligible infant remain study follow safety . For enrollment within 48 hour delivery , mother infant ( ) must meet eligibility criterion . For multiple birth , infant meet eligibility criterion enrol . Cohort 2 : Maternal MI pair enrol prior delivery Documentation HIV1 infection define positive result two sample collect different time point . All sample test must whole blood , serum , plasma . More information criterion find protocol .

Participant must age provide legal informed consent definied country resides . If , inform consent must sign legal guardian . Cohort 2 : Maternal MI pair enrol prior delivery Receipt disallow medication within 4 week prior enrollment intent disallow medication prior delivery . Note : Infant ( ) woman receive disallowed medication ineligible PK sampling . Cohort 2 : Infant PK Blood Sampling Eligibility Criteria : MI pair enrol prior delivery Infants enrol prior delivery infant inclusion criterion . Only infants meet follow criterion eligible PK blood sampling : Infant bear woman receive least one dose RAL within 2 24 hour prior delivery .
