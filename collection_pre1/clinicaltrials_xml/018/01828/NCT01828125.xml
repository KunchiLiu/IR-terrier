	<brief_summary>In unfortunate case severe hypoglycaemia , glucagon first-line treatment potent rapid action start fast 5 minute subcutaneous intramuscular injection . Large dose glucagon 1 mg subcutaneous usually associate undesirable side-effects nausea , vomit , bloat headache . The overall objective research proposal ass efficacy lower subcutaneous dos glucagon ( 0.1 mg 0.2 mg ) correct hypoglycaemia compare standard dose ( 1.0 mg ) adult type 1 diabetes mellitus ( T1D ) . It postulate much low dosage glucagon ( 0.1 0.2 mg ) inject subcutaneously effective current recommend dose 1.0 mg correct hypoglycaemia without undesirable gastro-intestinal side effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In unfortunate case severe hypoglycaemia , glucagon first-line treatment potent rapid action start fast 5 minute subcutaneous intramuscular injection . Current instruction treatment severe hypoglycaemia call immediate injection 1 mg glucagon subcutaneously intramuscularly . Large dose glucagon 1 mg subcutaneous usually associate undesirable side-effects nausea , vomit , bloat headache . Moreover , glucagon emergency kit relatively expensive ( around $ 100 per kit ) , thus increase financial burden diabetes patient health care system . The primary objective research project study pharmacological effect different dos glucagon inject subcutaneously correct hypoglycaemia control condition mimic hypoglycaemic event adult type 1 diabetes . More specifically , look effect subcutaneous glucagon inject 0.1 0.2 mg 1.0 mg normalize plasma glucose hypoglycaemic hyperinsulinemic clamp subject type 1 diabetes .</detailed_description>
