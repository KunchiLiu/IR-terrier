	<brief_summary>This prospective observational pilot study investigate transpharyngeal ultrasonography ( TPU ) additional neuromonitoring strategy assess cerebral perfusion on-pump cardiovascular surgery . In first part study investigator investigate feasibility TPU visualization aortic arch branch include innominate carotid artery twenty patient undergo coronary artery bypass graft extracorporeal circulation ( cohort 1. ) . In second part investigator plan adopt investigator previous experience TPU select population twelve patient undergo ascend aortic and/or arch repair deep hypothermic circulatory arrest ( DHCA , cohort 2. ) . In contrast cohort 1. , patient cohort 2. expose intraoperatively intermittent cerebral perfusion stop reduction due surgical procedure , perfusion technique underlie disease ( aortic dissection aortic aneurysm ) . The investigator hypothesize cerebral perfusion monitoring use TPU non-invasive technique provide simple real-time adjunct ass blood flow velocity extracranial cephalic vessel Doppler ultrasound . Especially aortic arch surgery inherent risk cerebral hypoperfusion TPU might valuable adjunct routine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Cerebral hypo- malperfusion cardiovascular surgery lead grave consequence include transient cerebral ischemia stroke impair patient ` daily life affect surgical outcome . For reason multimodal neuromonitoring strategy use variety device ( evoked potential , near-infrared spectroscopy , transcranial Doppler ultrasonography ) different technology recommend medical society . These technique various limitation use clinical situation . In contrast , transpharyngeal ultrasonography ( TPU ) represent simple readily available technique : transesophageal echocardiography probe , routinely place cardiac surgical patient monitor assessment surgical result , withdraw upper esophagus make visualization supraaortic branch possible . To date , several report image aortic arch branch use TPU . The utility technique , however , systematic cerebrovascular monitoring investigate far . Objective The aim study investigate TPU cerebrovascular monitoring adjunct two cohort on-pump cardiac surgery procedure . Clinical feasibility diagnostic accuracy antegrade carotid flow detection compare establish reference method Duplex sonography transcranial Doppler ultrasound . Methods All patient receive anesthetic surgical management accord institutional standard . Patient enrollment study occur consecutively unblinded surgical procedure . All patient receive TPU , Duplex sonography transcranial Doppler examination anesthesia induction preoperatively , extracorporeal circulation wean cardiopulmonary bypass . In addition , patient cohort 2 . ( ascend aortic repair DHCA ) receive mention noninvasive ultrasound / Doppler measurement also period DHCA without antegrade cerebral perfusion . Image acquisition data extraction conduct different person avoid investigator-related bias .</detailed_description>
