	<brief_title>Triple Vulnerability ? Circadian Tendency , Sleep Deprivation Adolescence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Teens exhibit circadian tendency toward eveningness ( 'night-owls ' ) follow delay sleep schedule , increase activity later day go sleep get later , compare morning-types ( 'larks ' ) . The circadian tendency toward eveningness adolescence arises confluence psychosocial , behavioral biological factor important contributor , maybe even cause , vicious cycle escalate vulnerability risk poor health major form psychopathology . Indeed , even circadian tendency associate wide range adverse effect include poor health , poor academic performance , poor self-regulation , great use substance , great tendency impulsivity , depression anxiety , great emotional instability aggressive antisocial behavior . While biological shift toward eveningness puberty may difficult modify , psychosocial behavioral contributor modifiable . Moreover , modify contributor eliminate key factor exacerbate biological shift . The propose research advance current knowledge role eveningness mechanism contribute poor outcome adolescence . The investigator aim reduce eveningness among 10-18 year old via intervention integrate evidence-based treatment derive basic research circadian system ( Treatment 1 ) compare psychoeducational intervention highlight interplay sleep , diet , exercise stress ( Treatment 2 ) . The investigator randomly allocate adolescent even circadian tendency , 'at risk ' least one five health domain ( emotional , cognitive , behavioral , social , physical ) , either : ( ) Treatment 1 ( n = 86 ) ( b ) Treatment 2 ( n = 86 ) . Measures take pre-treatment , post-treatment , 6 12 month post-treatment . This research first step within long term plan accelerate knowledge potentially powerful positive effect , develop neural system , simple , disseminable psychosocial intervention specifically design target modifiable risk factor across adolescence .</detailed_description>
