	<brief_summary>Very study examine different model care involve initial ambulatory home-based diagnosis diagnose obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) , identify patient benefit continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) , reduce need polysomnography ( PSG ) . This study aim assess role ambulatory approach home diagnostic sleep study . We hypothesize ambulatory approach good conventional approach manage OSA term improvement clinical outcome former approach lead substantial cost saving .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>We conduct prospective , randomize , control continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) parallel study new referral Respiratory Clinic , Prince Wales Hospital , suspect obstructive sleep apnea ( OSAS ) . OSAS define apnea-hypopnea index ( AHI ) 5/hr sleep plus excessive daytime sleepiness two follow symptom : choke gasp sleep , recurrent awakening sleep , unrefreshed sleep , daytime fatigue , impaired concentration . All patient suspect OSAS underwent assessment clinic Epworth sleepiness score ( ESS ) symptoms evaluation . Patients ESS score &gt; 9 least two OSAS symptom describe invited join study . They randomize either group A ) home-based management approach group B ) hospital-based management approach random table third party involved trial .</detailed_description>
