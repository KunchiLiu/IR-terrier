	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study Monoclonal Antibody MGAH22 ( Margetuximab ) Patients With Relapsed Refractory Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In pivotal study establish Herceptin® highly effective add standard chemotherapy front-line treatment woman HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer , benefit appear accrue patient whose tumor express HER2 oncoprotein 3+ level immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) patient whose tumor demonstrate evidence HER2 gene amplification fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) test . Similarly , Herceptin® use single therapy woman metastatic breast cancer progress follow cytotoxic chemotherapy , 3+ overexpression HER2 , 2+ expression , associate response treatment . These study lead recommendation Herceptin® administer patient breast cancer whose tumor exhibit 3+ overexpression gene amplification . This study evaluate whether treatment patient tumor would expect respond Herceptin® therapy , namely lack HER2 gene amplification express oncoprotein 2+ level IHC , may benefit use anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody , MGAH22 . If 5 response see 41 evaluable patient , clinical development margetuximab justify .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically cytologically confirm invasive carcinoma breast Treatment least two prior systemic therapy advance ( unresectable locoregional metastatic ) disease Evidence HER2 oncoprotein expression 2+ level central laboratory . Patients whose tumor exhibit 2+ stain IHC eligible study . Patients whose tumor score 1+ conventional IHC , nonamplified FISH testing , whose tumor score &gt; 10.5 HERmark® testing , eligible study . Evidence lack HER2 oncogene amplification determine FISH test central laboratory Performance Status 0 1 Life expectancy least 6 month Measurable disease ( RECIST 1.1 ) Acceptable laboratory parameter organ reserve Baseline leave ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 50 % Anticancer therapy ( include conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or biological therapy ) radiotherapy must complete associated toxicity resolve &lt; /= Grade 1 level baseline level least 2 week must elapse enrollment . Treatment monoclonal antibody must complete least 14 day entry . Must complete immunosuppressive medication vaccination enrollment . Patients ER+ and/or PR+ receive antihormone therapy least three month may continue receive therapy course trial Eighteen ( 18 ) year age old Major surgery trauma within 4 week Known hypersensitivity murine recombinant protein , polysorbate 80 , excipient contain margetuximab drug formulation Second primary malignancy remission 3 year History active viral , bacterial , systemic fungal infection require parenteral treatment within 14 day History within 3 month deep vein thrombosis , pulmonary embolism , stroke Symptomatic untreated central nervous system ( CNS ) metastatic disease . Patients previously treat CNS metastatic disease stable least 56 day eligible Requirement , time study entry , concurrent steroid &gt; 10 mg/day oral prednisone equivalent , except steroid inhaler , nasal spray , ophthalmic solution Serious medical condition would impair ability receive tolerate margetuximab ; dementia alter mental status would preclude provision inform consent Uncontrolled hypertension , heart disease include history congestive heart failure , history myocardial infarction , angina pectoris require medication , clinically significant valvular heart disease , high risk arrhythmia , disease correspond New York Heart Association class III IV .
