	<brief_title>Efficacy Jobelyn™ Consumption Hemoglobin Levels Borderline Anemic Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>From past history , case study Nigeria , well testimonial world , show robust increase hemoglobin within week people serious case anemia present disease condition sickle cell , Malaria , HIV , cancer . In parallel , improvement red blood cell health also see many healthy people general low blood count due undetermined factor . A clinical study anemia currently ongoing Nigeria . The study population focus woman aim evaluate whether Jobelyn™ consumption help increase hemoglobin thus reduce risk factor associate gynecological surgery Nigerian cohort gynecological patient ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier : NCT01670955 ) . As parallel ongoing study Nigeria , study protocol help systematically examine effect Jobelyn™ anemic condition otherwise healthy North American population , help document speed magnitude improvement population without concomitant infection sickle cell anemia . Twenty-four human subject gender test period 8 week . Both gender may enroll study , expect woman eligible , due effect menses prolong consumption birth control pill . Recruiting volunteer happen via NIS Labs . A screen blood draw use CBC/differential hemoglobin level help determine eligibility . Enrolled subject randomize consume placebo Jobelyn™ 8 week , time subject monitor baseline , 3 day , 7 day , 2 , 4 , 8 week . A fasting blood sample take visit , use hemoglobin fast glucose measurement .</detailed_description>
