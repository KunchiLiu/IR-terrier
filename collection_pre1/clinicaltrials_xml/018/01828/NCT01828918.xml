	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) one frequent malignancy also third major cause cancer-related death Taiwan , 11,000 new case CRC diagnose 4,400 Taiwanese die CRC 2008 ( Department Health ) . CRC regard accumulation acquire genetic epigenetic change cause disorder cell growth , differentiation apoptosis result transformation normal colonic epithelium colon adenocarcinoma . Recent basic clinical research circulate tumor cell ( CTCs ) CRC patient take potential diagnostics , prognosis , application consideration , especially molecular detection CTCs peripheral blood . Moreover , identification therapeutic target CTCs real-time monitoring CTCs cancer patient undergo systemic therapy important future clinical application . The investigator divide current project three dimension include biomarkers related diagnostic , prognostic predictive role potential clinical implication . Sub-project 1 : prognostic validation economic evaluation biochips/biomarkers . Sub-project 2 : evaluation biomarkers tailor therapy . Sub-project 3 : identification validation novel biomarkers early detection . After accomplishment three sub-projects , comprehensive network include early diagnostic , prognostic predictive biomarkers/biochips high-risk screening , postoperative surveillance , therapeutic strategy CRC patient form .</detailed_description>
