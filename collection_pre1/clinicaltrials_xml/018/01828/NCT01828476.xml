	<detailed_description>Subjects either treat one early dosing regimen randomly assign one two group ARMs study . ARM A receive Abiraterone ABT-263 . ARM B receive Abiraterone ABT-263 Hydroxychloroquine In begin study total 18 patient may get one three dose level . A total nine ( 9 ) patient per arm start low dose give increase dos side effect see . In part study three patient enrol dose level individual arm starting Arm A follow Arm B .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must evidence disease progression receive primary androgen suppression therapy orchiectomy primary hormonal therapy abiraterone ( Specifically , patient receive multiple prior additional androgen axis target agent include enzalutamide , prior chemotherapy , must progression ( defined 5.1.2 ) receive abiraterone either currently past ) . Patients currently abiraterone may continue start study drug ( ) . Patients must evidence disease progression current prior therapy abiraterone either : 1 . Biochemical progression define rise PSA nadir baseline ( whichever low ) confirm second determination least 1 week later must higher first must reach ≥2ng/ml ( evidence progression ) ; 2 .
