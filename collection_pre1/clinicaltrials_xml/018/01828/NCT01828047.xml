	<brief_title>Sublingual Microcirculation Postoperative Ileus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AIM OF THE STUDY This observational study ass whether perioperative microcirculatory change correlate symptom associate primary POI . PRIMARY RESEARCH QUESTION Is correlation peri-operative microcirculatory flow measurement incidence symptomatic primary POI ? SECONDARY RESEARCH QUESTIONS 1 . Is correlation peri-operative microcirculatory flow measurement duration symptomatic primary POI ? 2 . If correlation observe , anatomic location ( sublingual mucosa v bowel serosa ) yield microcirculatory flow measurement strongly associate incidence and/or duration symptomatic primary POI ? 3 . Can either intraoperative sublingual mucosa intraoperative bowel serosa microcirculatory flow measurement predict symptom primary POI ? Are two anatomic location equivalent ability predict complication ?</detailed_description>
