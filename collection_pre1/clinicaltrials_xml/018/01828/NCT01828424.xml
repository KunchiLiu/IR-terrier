	<brief_title>Prediction Postoperative Pain Measuring Nociception End Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute postoperative pain need alleviate quickly avoid sensitization postoperative period , since sensitization lead pain chronification . Severe acute postoperative pain important risk factor development persistent postoperative pain . Unfortunately , dose opioids necessary alleviate postoperative pain highly variable , even patient expose surgical procedure . Anesthesiologists usually try prevent immediate postoperative pain adjust analgesic dose end surgery perceive need analgesia . However , approach limit problem respiratory depression induce large dose opiate analgesic . Studies show despite attempt many patient awake moderate severe pain . A mean predict immediate postoperative pain surgery response opiate analgesic would therefore highly desirable . Many study try reveal predictive factor evaluate start surgery , explain 50 % observed variability postoperative pain intensity . A different approach may evaluation intraoperative nociception end surgery directly guide appropriate analgesia patient regain consciousness . Measuring reflex pupil dilation standardize electrical stimulus one method measure opioid effect intra-operatively . This parameter may reflect opioid sensitivity , pain sensitivity . Recently , different method measure nociception anesthesia introduce , nociceptive reflex ( RIII ) threshold . Measuring RIII threshold end surgery may allow anesthesiologist administer dose analgesic necessary awaken without pain , avoid overdose respiratory depression . Until , relationship RIII threshold postoperative pain intensity establish . The primary objective study therefore evaluation relationship RIII threshold , pain intensity immediately surgery respiratory depression end anesthesia . The primary objective study evaluation relationship RIII threshold end surgery , pain intensity immediately surgery respiratory depression end anesthesia . Secondary objective evaluation alternative measure nociception pupillary dilation reflex heart rate variability outcome measure . The study design single centre , observational , descriptive study .</detailed_description>
