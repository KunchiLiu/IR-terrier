	<brief_summary>The VA commit disseminate web-based Healthy Living Assessment tool use cornerstone personalize prevention plan engage patient improve health behavior lead high health risk . Health risk assessment do isolation , however , generally lead behavior change . Our study test effectiveness Shared Decision Making intervention design activate Veterans enroll effective prevention program . The intervention conduct telephone , prevention coach , link patient ' primary care team . The co-primary outcome patient activation patient enrollment prevention program ; 10-year risk major cardiac event also measure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Will Veterans Engage Prevention After HRA-guided Shared Decision Making ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over half death , many illness , attribute four modifiable risk factor : tobacco use , overweight/obesity , physical inactivity , alcohol use . There clear link modifiable factor heart disease , cancer , chronic lung disease , stroke continue lead cause death United States . Significant improvement make control condition lead heart disease , cancer stroke ( e.g. , hypertension hyperlipidemia ) . However , underlying behavioral factor ( e.g. , obesity , tobacco use , physical inactivity ) address well . Prevention particularly important Veterans high prevalence significant risk factor poor health . For example , 70 % VHA patient overweight ( body mass index [ BMI ] 25kg/m2 ) one-third obese ( BMI 30kg/m2 ) , significantly high US population . Smoking also remain significant problem among Veterans , VHA enrollment data 2010 indicate prevalence 20 % . Younger Veterans particularly high risk develop chronic illness likely overweight/obese smoke heavily non-Veterans . The investigator propose two-site , two-arm randomize trial measure effectiveness Shared Decision Making ( SDM ) intervention activate Veterans enroll effective prevention service , improve cardiovascular risk , compare VA usual care . The study perform Durham Ann Arbor VAMCs . Each arm 225 patient ; patient VA user least one modifiable risk factor ( obese , inactive , tobacco user ) currently enrol prevention service . The SDM intervention conduct prevention coach , telephone base , use output VHA 's Healthy Living Assessment engage Veterans conversation individual preference match behavior , choice specific prevention service . The result prevention action plan share Veterans primary care team , document medical record . Outcomes obtained baseline , 1 month 6 month enrollment blind research personnel . The primary outcome : 1 ) proportion enrol effective prevention service ; 2 ) change Patient Activation Measure ( PAM ) . The secondary outcome 10-year risk coronary event , measure Framingham Risk Score . Process evaluation intervention implementation also conduct inform future dissemination implementation prove effective .</detailed_description>
