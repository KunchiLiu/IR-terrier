	<brief_summary>The study include two study part blood collect patient . Study part A ( observational study , already receive positive ethic committee vote ; Our sign : 12-330 ) : Use blood sample gather routine blood withdrawal Study part B ( interventional study sense additional blood sample without investigational product ) : Optional , pharmacokinetic question : blood withdrawal maximum 20 ml ( ten tube 2 ml ) within maximal study length four week . The primary objective study gain overview drug concentration plasma and/or cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) , order determine pharmacokinetics drug patient . Any drug may test , however initial focus antiinfective , antineoplastic , antipsychotic drug . Many publish study show profound lack information pharmacokinetics interaction many commonly use drug clinical routine , drug concentration , control therapeutic drug monitoring , therapeutic range ( provided range know ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>For effective pharmacotherapy patient different demographic characteristic ( age , weight lean body mass ) , often lack information dosage drug . The predictability action drug additionally impaired genetic predisposition . Even effect genetic variant demonstrate , respective characteristic patient usually know . For example , study ( Gamelin et al. , 2008 ) `` old '' cytostatic drug 5-fluorouracil show genetically-dependent efficacy . Only one third patient concentration reach desire therapeutic range ( dosage adjust body surface ) . There significant lack information pharmacokinetics , especially critically ill patient . These patient exclude modern drug approval study , although anticipate , depend drug , many patient severely impaired renal function , renal replacement therapy , severe hepatic dysfunction , sepsis multiple organ failure may later obtain substance . This knowledge gap specific pharmacokinetics drug select population present new drug , also already use therapy decade . Particularly effect body weight liver function pharmacokinetics , data sparse . For latter , lack data particularly striking , search data concern patient severe hepatic dysfunction . If occasional data specific drug available , substance sufficient develop safe dose regimen , e.g . aforementioned example 5-fluorouracil . Furthermore , many drug reliable pharmacokinetic data renal impairment renal replacement therapy available . The available data generally much well hepatic insufficiency , especially lack data pharmacokinetics metabolite renal insufficiency may relevance , metabolite active play important role effect , may also responsible side effect . To illustrate , `` Fachinformation '' ( April 30th 2012 ) , legally bind document dose issue drug Germany , attach . This table provide selection important drug , exhaustive . In hospital predominantly severely ill patient treat several drug administer simultaneously . Thus , issue drug-drug interaction center attention . Unexpected new clinical interaction drug know long time , interaction well-known substance new substance report . A recent example interaction cause Cotrimoxazol , drug combination use decade ( Antoniou et al. , 2011 ) . In summary , state drug therapy high demand quantification vivo plasma liquor drug concentration quantify effect different characteristic pharmacokinetics drug . Thus , concentration broad range substance use Cologne University Hospital measure , include respective metabolite . Concentrations plasma CSF ( drug suppose effect central nervous system ) quantify . This screen approach possible due increase availability highly sensitive selective liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS ) method , thereby number measurable substance markedly increase . The initial focus project antiinfective , antineoplastic antipsychotic agent .</detailed_description>
