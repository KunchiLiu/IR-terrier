	<brief_title>Residual Gastric Volume After Ingestion Beverage Containing Carbohydrates Plus Whey Protein</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The use carbohydrate-rich beverage immediate preoperative period safe , may also reduce catabolic stress response , nausea , vomit , thus enhance postoperative recovery.The addition protein may increase benefit study matter . Several study also show nutritional quality soluble whey protein . Whey protein contain high level essential amino acid especially branched-chain amino acid . The digestibility gastric empty accelerate compare casein . We think gastroscopy would excellent model test gastric empty drink test elective operation . Thus , aim study investigate residual gastric volume ( RGV ) measure gastroscopy abbreviation fast 2h carbohydrate- whey protein-drink . Methods A group adult patient ( age range 18 72years-old ) schedule undergoing upper digestive endoscopy diagnostic purpose due epigastric burning Gastroclinica , Cuiab√° , Brazil eligible inclusion trial . Exclusion criterion : American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) score II , diabetes mellitus , pregnancy , renal hepatic failure , gastroesophageal reflux , morbid obesity ( BMI 40 kg/m2 , acute cholecystitis , use corticosteroid 6 month previously , use prokinetic drug 6 week , noncompliance violation assign protocol preoperative fasting . The local ethic committee approve study , patient authorize his/her inclusion study write informed consent . Randomization A staff involve study proceed randomization process . A computer program generate random number assign patient two group . Patients randomize receive either conventional preoperative fast 8 hour ( fast group , n=15 ) receive instruction 2 hour fast ( study group , n=15 ) . Patients belong study group fast solid 8h drink 200mL beverage contain maltodextrine addition whey protein ( Fresubin Jucy , Fresenius Kabi , Brazil ) 2 hour initiation sedation propofol endoscopic exam . Fasting protocol All patient receive oral write information protocol outpatient clinic . Endoscopies schedule begin 8:00 AM . The evening operation patient free ingest solid food 11:00 PM . The patient belong abbreviation fast receive write instruction ingest beverage 6:00 AM ( 200 mL ) , Gastroclinica unit 7:00 AM . Endoscopy protocol Endoscopy perform certified gastroenterologist staff routine . Special attention do RGV . The find residual gastric content mean content aspirate measure . The RGV measure mL main outcome measure study . Outcome variable statistical analysis The main endpoint study RGV . Comparison RGV two group do either Student test Mann-Whitney test . A 5 % establish significant level .</detailed_description>
