	<brief_title>A Trial Reduce Adhesions Following Primary Cesarean Section</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A cesarean section delivery ( C-section/CD ) surgical removal infant placenta mother 's abdominal uterine wall . This procedure perform obstetrician one common type surgical method use today . According Centers Disease Control Prevention , rate method delivery risen past decade . However , recent research show patient receive surgical procedure become susceptible adhesion . Adhesions formation ( band ) scar tissue occur immediately follow surgical procedure . Adhesions limit mobility tissue organ near incision site cause stick together . This limited mobility generate increase rate morbidity ( occurrence disease ) . Morbidities cause adhesion include limited abdominal and/or pelvic pain , bowel obstruction ( partial complete blockage bowel ) , subfertility ( difficulty get pregnant ) infertility ( inability get pregnant ) . A study conduct Dierdre Lyell , MD report incidence adhesion formation follow primary CD range 46-65 % . Another study ( Morales et al ) report woman undergone CD , incidence rate adhesion severe adhesion great woman repeat CDs compare woman primary CD . In addition , study also state percentage adhesion occurrence increase woman subsequent ( follow ) CD . Numerous method implement toward prevention adhesion . Currently , Seprafilm approve adhesion prevention method use surgical procedure . Seprafilm clear film compose chemically modify sugar ( occur naturally human body ) . Unlike counterpart Interceed , Seprafilm unaffected presence blood . After place , Seprafilm become gel within 24-48 hour slowly absorb excrete body course 1-4 week . Seprafilm Adhesion Barrier FDA approve use patient undergo abdominal pelvis laparotomy adjunct intend reduce incidence , extent severity post-operative adhesion abdominal uterus surround structure .</detailed_description>
