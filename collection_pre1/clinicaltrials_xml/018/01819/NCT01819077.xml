	<brief_summary>TMMR/tLNE show result low locoregional recurrence rate low morbidity surgical treatment cervical cancer stage IB-IIA without adjuvant radiotherapy even high risk situation . More therapeutic strategy implement clinical routine specialize cancer centre , thus , treatment cervical cancer could perform stage systematically define reproducible radicality ; adjuvant radiotherapy could spar recurrent disease , thus lower morbidity resource assignment primary treatment dramatically . Due nerve-sparing character procedure bladder , bowel sexual dysfunction would also minimize markedly benefit patient . This study design follow result therapeutic concept adapt clinical routine multiinstitutional register study accompany detailed assessment pathological work-up , quality life bladder sexual function follow surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>TMMR ( Total Mesometrial Resection ) Register Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale multimodal treatment cervical cancer FIGO stag IB-IIA accord M. Hoeckel : Total mesometrial resection ( TMMR ) newly develop procedure surgical treatment cervical cancer FIGO stage IB IIB . The procedure base embryologically determined surgical anatomy generate investigation embryonal fetal development Müllerian organ system local tumor spread cervical cancer macroscopic , microscopic molecular level ( 11-13 ) . The observation cervical cancer follow embryologically derive compartment hierarchy lead definition new principle radicality oncological surgery , i.e. , resection tumor within border compartment represent morphogenetic unit tumor origin . A resection follow principle lead high local control ( &gt; 95 % ) without additional radiotherapy . The resection line vagina locate inside compartment , therefore intraoperative frozen section examination TMMR specimen necessary achieve wide margin . Adjacent structure belong another morphogenetic unit save spite immediate proximity tumor . The autonomic nerve save TMMR concept well ureter , urinary bladder mesentery contain blood vessel , rectum mesorectum . Therapeutic LNE : With TMMR tLNE do therapeutic intent , case lymph node metastases high regional tumor control without adjuvant radiotherapy achieve ( 27 ) . Therapeutic pelvic tLNE need removal lymph node group within scope classical systematic pelvic LNE additionally , paravisceral fatty tissue inferior obturator nerve , perispinal , gluteal presacral lymph node S2 . The therapeutic pelvic LNE do exposition protection plexus hypogastricus superior , nervus hypogastricus plexus hypogastricus inferior ureter supply vessel , bilaterally . In case intraoperative evidence pelvic lymph node metastasis first line node stepwise ascend therapeutic para-aortic LND protection plexus hypogastricus superior nervi splanchnici lumbales do . To date prospective , randomized trial proven survival benefit adjuvant chemotherapy alone patient early cervical cancer histopathological risk factor . However , retrospective study result Peters et al . ( 20 ) , compare adjuvant chemo-radiotherapy radiotherapy alone patient surgery cervical cancer suggest adjuvant chemotherapy may exert impact survival . The possible effect adjuvant chemotherapy take consideration apply surgical therapeutic concept ( 23 ; 25 ) . Therefore , adjuvant chemotherapy case risk factor perform Hoeckel 's trial . The mono-institutional prospective study University Leipzig , Department Gynecology Obstetrics , show treatment concept cervical cancer FIGO stag IB-IIB include TMMR therapeutic LNE without adjuvant radiotherapy achieves markedly improve therapeutic index comparison historic control ( 16 ; 22 ) : locoregional control 96 % versus 91 % , relapse-free survival three year 93 % vs. 84 % , treatment-caused side effect 9 % exclusively grade II vs. 28 % grade II III ( 11-13 ) . Scientific aim 1 . Observation result standardization radical hysterectomy therapeutic lymphadenectomy cervical cancer FIGO IB -IIA basis ontogenetically define compartment theory multicentric approach TMMR/LND clinical routine 2 . Assessment locoregional recurrence concept without radiation therapy show postoperative irradiation associate morbidity also avoid irradiation may maintain rescue recurrency condition clinical routine 3 . Confirmation low morbidity TMMR due autonomous nerve vessel preservation concomitant urogynecological psychosexual subprotocols clinical routine treatment Requirements participate center register study 1 . Study educational video ( M. Hoeckel , Leipzig 2010 ; R. Kimmig , Essen 2012 ) 2 . Passed Participation 2 day educational training concern TMMR `` Leipzig School Oncological Surgery '' 3 . Performing least 10 TMMR procedure participate institution/year 4 . Evaluation surgical technique participate institution Prof. Hoeckel ( Leipzig ) Prof. Kimmig ( Essen ) substitute determine M.Hoeckel R. Kimmig 5 . Securing standardized workup surgical specimen pathologist accord protocol ( Prof. Horn , Leipzig ) 6 . Acceptance study participation responsible project leader commitment online documentation primary histopathological clinical data well follow data assess . Primary outcome measure : ( 1 ) Progression-free survival , define time TMMR local regional relapse , distant metastasis death cause whichever event come first . Simultaneous occurrence pelvic distant metastasis consider distant document detail . Secondary efficacy measure : 1 . Overall survival , define time TMMR death cause ; Rate locoregional relapse rate distant metastases 3 year . 2 . Postoperative dysfunction bladder/urethra psychosexual function , assess described urogynecological psychosexual subprotocol . Secondary safety measure : 1 . Therapy-induced morbidity bladder/urethra , rectum/bowel , vagina/vulva , assess LENT-SOMA score system follow time surgery : subjective scale day 1 , week 1 2 , month 3 ; subjective objective scale month 12 24 . The questionnaire develop Davidson ( 7 ) use ; Time surgery first micturition ; Acute complication surgery ; adverse serious adverse event . 2 . Quality life EORTC-QLQ-C30 questionnaire 12 24 month surgery . Aim study assess recurrence rate morbidity follow TMMR/LNE without additional radiotherapy multicentric observation clinical routine treatment . In addition standardization radical hysterectomy pathological work stage Ib IIa cervical cancer achieve describe `` Requirements participate center '' . Two primary endpoint investigate , rank accord relevance : ( 1 ) PFS ( 2 ) Late effect bladder/urethra , measure subjective scale LENT-SOMA system . A hierarchical strategy use . Further time event endpoint illustrate Kaplan-Meier plot analyze like primary endpoint see .</detailed_description>
