	<brief_summary>Each year US , approximately 795,000 people stroke , overwhelming majority survive unable resume meaningful daily activity impair movement one arm/hand . This study investigate effect challenge 4-week physical rehabilitation therapy program target specific movement impairment systematically progressed assure ongoing `` right '' level rigor . The investigator anticipate therapy target address specific movement impairment improve recovery arm/hand movement people stroke .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Patient Targeted Upper Extremity Rehabilitation After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overwhelming majority individual survive stroke persistent upper extremity ( UE ) motor deficit interfere re-engagement meaningful activity . While advance neuroscience spur development new rehabilitation strategy , development novel measurement method keep pace . Currently , comprehensive measurement framework objectively quantify impairment , match rehabilitation therapy program patient 's impairment level , measure specific therapy effect . Therefore rehabilitation trial measurement framework basis design treatment well define outcome . The investigator redesign Fugl-Meyer UE Assessment ( FMA-UE ) use item response theory Rasch analysis develop first kind measurement framework locate patient along continuum impairment directs personalize therapy program tailor patient ' specific impairment ability level . The purpose propose research empirically test framework . The objective project empirically test FMA-UE measurement framework . This study hypothesize therapeutic task practice just-right challenge difficulty maximize post-stroke motor skill reacquisition . It expect `` target task-practice '' , increase UE motor ability task goal difficulty match systematically progress accord patient ' initial evolving level ability . This single-blinded study parallel arm design , stratify sample block randomization . 120 individual post-stroke UE hemiparesis enrol ; 40 participant per 3 UE impairment level define investigator ' measurement framework . Participants engage 12 session ( 3x/wk 4 week , 2 hrs/session ) reach-to-grasp task-practice . Within impairment level , subject randomized treatment group ; 20 target task-practice 20 non-targeted task-practice . Targeted task-practice personalized patient-specific UE motor deficit initial target ( goal ) define accord baseline measure target continually progress every 3 therapy session goal match patient 's evolve level ability . Non-targeted task practice define standard care task-practice intervention intend increase UE use alter specific impairment . Data analysis include ( 1 ) ANOVA test effect target vs. non-targeted therapy UE motor ability , ( 2 ) multiple regression model relationship therapy movement adaption occur pre- post-rehabilitation , ( 3 ) growth mixture model define responder non-responders . This project significant press need comprehensive measurement framework guide novel intervention design improve post-stroke UE motor function define effect .</detailed_description>
