	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study caloric restriction patient stage 0-I breast cancer surgery radiation therapy . Reducing caloric intake may prevent disease progression patient breast cancer . Radiation therapy use high energy x ray kill tumor cell . Giving dietary intervention radiation therapy together may kill tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Caloric Restriction Treating Patients With Stage 0-I Breast Cancer Undergoing Surgery Radiation Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : 1 . Investigate feasibility clinical trial administer ionize radiation concurrent caloric restriction ( CR ) treatment breast cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVE : 2 . Investigate measurable change patient characteristic tissue serum CR condition determine metric evaluate treatment future study . OUTLINE : Beginning 2-4 week completion lumpectomy , patient receive food diary complete 7-10 day . Dietary counselor give patient guideline dietary modification reduce caloric intake 25 % normal diet . Patients follow caloric restrict diet 10 week ( 2 week prior radiation therapy , 6 week radiation therapy , least 2 week radiation therapy ) . Patients undergo radiation therapy daily ( QD ) 5 day week 6 week .</detailed_description>
