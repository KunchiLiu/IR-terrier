	<brief_summary>Patients COPD ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) suffer episodes acute exacerbation lead additional morbidity mortality , also decline lung function . It well-established bacterial colonization prevalent COPD , especially moderate severe COPD , airway bacterial colonization know play important role development pneumonia exacerbation . On way , inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) long act Î²2 agonist ( LABA ) recommend treatment moderate severe COPD . Though evidence ICS protective effect airway mucosa bacteria invasion , locally immunosuppressive effect ICS still concern . Indeed , incidence pneumonia high control group , Towards Revolution COPD Health ( TORCH ) study also various study meta-analyses.We hypothesize airway bacteria colonization associate disease severity , disease status identify CAT ( COPD assessment test ) score change CAT score . We therefore conduct prospective , observational study CAT score sputum culture assess moderate severe COPD patient combination therapy ICS LABA every three month study period . The primary end-point condition potential pathogenic microorganism ( PPM ) colonization view CAT score . The second end-point change PPM colonization association CAT change follow-up . By mean CAT follow-up , could possibly provide surrogate risk exacerbation pneumonia combination therapy ICS LABA .</brief_summary>
