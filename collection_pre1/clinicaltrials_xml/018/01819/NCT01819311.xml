	<brief_title>Attention Bias Modification Training Child Anxiety CBT Nonresponders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This application propose pilot test Attention Bias Modification Training ( ABMT ) among child adolescent complete full protocol cognitive behavior therapy ( CBT ) anxiety still meet criterion primary diagnosis anxiety disorder full year completion CBT . There currently single empirical study youth anxiety treatment literature systematically examine treatment augment youth fail respond full course CBT . Empirical effort address issue important youth respond CBT continue suffer emotional distress impairment associate anxiety disorder , experience frustration demoralization perceive `` failure , '' likely pose financial burden health care system . ABMT novel translational treatment anxiety base experimental neuroscience research finding attention process . Research demonstrate ABMT lead reduction anxiety disorder . Based recent theory research demonstrate attention bias toward threat predicts CBT nonresponse among anxious youth , researcher postulate ABMT may hold promise augment CBT specific focus attention bias target frontal-cortical subcortical circuitry . This study recruit estimate 70 child adolescent complete 12-14 week CBT trial anxiety disorder one year follow-up continue meet criterion primary diagnosis anxiety disorder . These 70 child adolescent ( age 8-16 year ) randomly assign complete eight biweekly session either ABMT placebo control ( PC ) task . Clinician rating youth anxiety severity collect evaluated primary outcome . Youth self rating anxiety symptom parent rating youth anxiety symptom collect evaluated secondary outcome . All measure collect condition assignment ( pretreatment ) , immediate posttreatment , eight week follow . The follow specific aim address . Aim 1 : Test whether ABMT lead significantly low level anxiety posttreatment compare Placebo Control Task . Aim 2 : Examine whether ABMT lead significantly low level anxiety compare Placebo Control Task follow evaluation eight week posttreatment . This would suggest maintenance ABMT effect eight week treatment . Aim 3 : Gain perspective viability variables potential mediator moderator ABMT inform decision whether pursue variable future R01 . The variable propose potential mediator attention bias toward threat threat-related interpretation bias . The variable propose potential moderator attention control . Overall , project provide critically need data ABMT treatment augment youth anxiety disorder respond CBT . With data hand , field good position determine whether ABMT may use optimally among anxious youth likely need CBT .</detailed_description>
