	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics , Safety , Efficacy SPRIX 12 17 Year Old Patients v . Adult Patients Undergoing Open Surgical Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study intranasal ( IN ) ketorolac tromethamine ( SPRIX ) pediatric subject age 12-17 year vs. adult age 18-64 year undergo open surgical procedure expect result least moderate level pain ( i.e. , 40 0-100 Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) 0 pain 100 bad pain imaginable ) . Following surgery subject receive 1st dose SPRIX , pain reach VAS 40 , follow SPRIX administration every 6 hour . Blood sample PK assessment collect PK assessment pre-dose , 0.25 , 0.5 , 0.75 , 1 , 2 , 4 hour first dose , 6 hour ( immediately 2nd dose ) , immediately next several subsequent q6h dos dose administered morning post-operative day 2 . Blood sample collect 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 12 , 24 hour receive morning dose day 2 ( i.e. , last blood sample PK collect morning post-operative day 3 ) . Pain intensity ( PI ) assess use 0-100 VAS 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 4 , 6 hour post dose , 2 hour 2nd dose , immediately prior dose 12 , 18 , 24 hour baseline . Patients may elect continue take SPRIX total 5 day daily assessment pain intensity use diary . A final follow-up phone interview conduct 14 day final dose study drug . Thus , subject 's study participation consist screen visit , treatment/assessment period 5 day , follow-up interview .</detailed_description>
