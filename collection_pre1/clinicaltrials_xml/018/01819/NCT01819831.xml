	<brief_summary>When treat surgery alone , many soft-tissue sarcoma high chance come back . Radiation therapy frequently use addition surgery reduce chance sarcoma come back . However , radiation long-term side effect normal tissue surround tumor , lead problem swell , scar , joint stiffness . Recently , advance way radiation therapy give . Proton radiation therapy one advance . With proton radiation , possible give radiation small area surround tumor , result less radiation surround normal tissue . The purpose study determine whether proton radiation decrease long-term side effect radiation normal tissue small proton radiation field reduce local recurrence compare large radiation field use prior study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Trial Preoperative Proton Therapy Soft-tissue Sarcomas Extremities Body Wall</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data support preoperative radiotherapy one standard option management large high-grade extremity soft tissue sarcoma ( STS ) . The advantage preoperative radiotherapy low dose small radiation volume ; may use effect improvement long-term side effect extremity function . Another potential advantage assist surgery tumor shrinkage reduction tumor cell seed . The disadvantage preoperative radiation high likelihood postoperative wound complication , prospective phase III trial complication find generally temporary without significant effect long term function . Combined conservative surgery radiotherapy show achieve excellent local control sarcoma patient follow margin-negative surgery , late radiation morbidity reduce quality life may result adjuvant radiation . The dosimetric advantage proton radiotherapy may translate reduce acute late effect due improve normal-tissue sparing treatment extremity truncal STS . However , potential advantage need validated clinical trial . The investigator propose phase II study evaluate effect preoperative proton radiotherapy reduction late radiation morbidity , pattern failure , impact late radiation morbidity general quality life ( QOL ) .</detailed_description>
