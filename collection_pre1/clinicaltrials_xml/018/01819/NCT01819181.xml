	<detailed_description>WINTAVI international , multi-centre , prospective , observational registry . The purpose study collect 'real-world ' data regard clinical utility commercially available Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation ( TAVI ) device percutaneous aortic valve implantation female patient severe Aortic Stenosis ( AS ) require treatment . Data collect study provide additional information understand safety device performance 'real-world ' set best treat patient severe AS . This include Quality Life questionnaire ( KCCQ ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Severe AS determine echocardiogram Doppler , define : mean gradient &gt; 40 mmHg peak jet velocity &gt; 4.0 m/s aortic valve area ≤0.8 cm2 aortic valve area index ≤0.5 cm2/m2 2 . Symptomatic AS demonstrated angina , congestive heart failure , NYHA functional class ≥ II , syncope 3 . Logistic EuroSCORE suitable TAVI 4 . Patient must condition ( severe airway disease , porcelain aorta , previous thoracic radiotherapy , Childs Pugh class B C liver disease ) multidisciplinary team ( interventional cardiologist , cardiothoracic surgeon cardiac anaesthesiologists ) agree comorbidities render SAVR high prohibitive risk . 5 . Patient informed nature registry provide full write informed consent accord hospital practise 1 . Patient eligible candidate TAVI 2 . Untreated clinically significant ( &gt; 70 % obstruction ) coronary artery disease proximal segment main branch suitable revascularization 3 . Echocardiographic evidence intracardiac mass , thrombus vegetation 4 . Hemodynamic instability ( e.g . require inotropic support ) 5 . Active endocarditis sepsis within 6months prior study procedure 6 . Use investigational device without CE mark</criteria>
