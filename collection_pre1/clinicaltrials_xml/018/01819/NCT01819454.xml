	<brief_summary>The aim project define frequency EER present patient chronic rhinosinusitis ( CHR ) . The measurement carry 24-hour monitoring pH use Restech system . This modern device equip narrow antimony probe . The sensor able record liquid also aerosol reflux episode . The second aim determine relation among EER , CHR asthma bronchiale . We compare presence reflux three different patient group ( 1 . CHR without nasal polyposis , without asthma bronchiale ASA syndrome , 2 . CHR nasal polyposis , without asthma bronchiale ASA syndrome , 3 . CHR nasal polyposis asthma bronchiale and/or ASA syndrome ) . We expect find significantly frequent presence EER patient CHR asthma bronchiale ASA syndrome . In case hypothesis confirm , especially patient ( difficult manage nasal polyposis ) benefit antireflux therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Diagnostics Extraesophageal Reflux With Restech System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction The problem relation ENT disease ( posterior laryngitis , granulomas vocal cord , globus pharyngeus others ) extraesophageal reflux ( EER ) , associate refluxate penetrate level upper oesophageal sphincter , study intensely especially last several year . The golden standard diagnostics EER remain dual-channel 24-hour pH-metry . The methodology procedure standardize past several year differs significantly oesophageal pH-metry carried gastroenterologist ( upper probe usually place level upper oesophageal sphincter ) . The pH-metry enable u monitor especially impact EER upon disease oesophagus hypopharynx . Non-existence simple sensitive method barrier detail examination relation EER proximally locate part upper respiratory tract ( nasopharynx , nasal cavity paranasal sinus , middle-ear cavity ) . The problem `` classical '' pH-metry probe lie fact unless sensor cover mucosa , dry record accurate . The Restech system introduce two year ago , aim improve EER diagnostics oropharynx nasopharynx . The sensor sensitive antimony probe position tip 1,5 mm catheter , insert nose behind uvula ( exact positioning control use illuminate end catheter ) . High sensitivity device enable measure pH liquid also small aerosol drop - call aerosol reflux . The examination take 24 hour , data transfer wirelessly record device . Normative data non-symptomatic group also define . The advantage method , compare dual-probe 24-hour pH-metry high sensitivity , easy accomplishment well compliance patient population . However , wide comparison data different pathological condition still miss . EER consider one possible factor may contribute onset worsen exist chronic rhinosinusitis ( CHR ) . It well-known fact part patient CHR undergo endonasal surgery suffer early recurrence disease . DelGaudio find , use 3-channel pH-metry , adult patient refractory recurrent chronic rhinosinusitis experience significantly high number nasopharyngeal reflux , compare patient population present symptom surgical treatment ; recommend anti-reflux therapy part treatment patient refractory chronic rhinosinusitis . The view support another author , Pincus , clinical trial confirm good effect proton pump inhibitor treatment patient . According EPOS ( European Position Paper On Rhinosinusitis Nasal Polyps , 2007 ) , relation EER chronic rhinosinusitis currently level III degree evidence . EPOS also summarise fact patient suffer chronic rhinosinusitis pH-metry proven EER , present significantly frequently alleviation symptom follow anti-reflux therapy . In respect , EPOS recommend clinical investigation problem . It possible assume Restech system enable precise diagnostics patient ( compare pH-metry ) , however system test diagnostics EER patient CHR , either Czech Republic abroad . If propose relation confirm , mean dramatic change process treatment part CHR patient , suffer time EER ( `` urgent '' recommendation anti-reflux therapy , especially patient recurrent refractory CHR ) . It prove past part patient population difficult control asthma bronchiale also suffer EER , patient profit greatly treatment use proton pump inhibitor . Also part patient CHR suffers asthma bronchiale complete ASA syndrome . It possible assume EER , negative impact upon asthma bronchiale , may similar negative effect upon CHR . The mutual interrelation among EER , CHR asthma bronchiale thoroughly study ; one aim propose project also explore relation . Aims project - determine often EER present patient population CHR - compare occurrence EER three group patient 1 . CHR without nasal polyposis , without asthma bronchiale ASA syndrome 2 . CHR nasal polyposis , without asthma bronchiale ASA syndrome 3 . CHR nasal polyposis asthma bronchiale and/or ASA syndrome Working hypotheses 1 . A part patient CHR present significant pathological EER penetrating nasopharynx ( significantly high number EER episode , compare asymptomatic population ) 2 . EER frequent patient CHR concomitant asthma bronchiale ASA syndrome Methodology The project design prospective study compliance principle policy Helsinki Declaration approve Ethics Committee . Patients : The patient enrol study rhinology out-patient part ENT department University Hospital Ostrava . A total 90 patient enrol study within 4 year : 30 patient suffer CHR without nasal polyposis , without asthma bronchiale ASA syndrome , 30 patient suffer CHR nasal polyposis , without asthma bronchiale ASA syndrome , 30 patient suffer CHR nasal polyposis asthma bronchiale and/or ASA syndrome Inclusion criterion : 1/ age ( 18-60 year ) , 2/ signing inform consent . Entry examination : Patients enrol study ask complete questionnaire ( age , sex , body weight , body height , smoke habit , asthma bronchiale ASA syndrome , period treatment CHR , number endonasal surgery past ) , complete Reflux symptom questionnaire ( questionnaire use determine symptom typical EER ) , Reflux find score ( finding larynx typical EER ) degree polyposis ( 1.-3 . ) record . 24-hour monitoring nasopharyngeal pH use Restech system : Description Restech device please see `` Introduction '' . The measure parameter prove EER nasopharyngeal area : number EER episode , fractional time pH 5.5 RYAN composite score . Data collection , analysis data proposal statistical process The statistical processing carry Ing . Hana Tomášková , PhD . Institute Epidemiology Public Health , Medical Faculty Ostrava University . 1 . The percentage patient EER define overall number CHR patient individually group . 2 . We determine whether exists significantly high percentage patient EER three examine group , compare group . 3 . Other independently assessed factor group patient proven EER group without proven EER age , sex , BMI , smoke habit , Reflux symptom index , Reflux find score , asthma bronchiale ASA syndrome , length CHR treatment , number endonasal surgery past degree nasal polyposis . The method descriptive statistic use statistical processing ( arithmetic mean , standard deviation , frequency table ) , X2 test , Fisher 's exact test , analysis variance ( ANOVA ) , OR calculation ( odds ratio ) 95 % confidence interval logistic regression . The statistical test assess significance level 5 % . The statistical analysis carry Stata v. 10 programme . We use MS Excel programme data collection . Discussion Measurement pH Restech system new sophisticated method introduce clinical practice course past two year . The first normative data composite RYAN score already define healthy population ( please see Literature ) . Now necessary verify correlation symptoms clinical finding different patient group , may worsen EER . One patient group also patient CHR . There sparse publication world literature ( DelGaudio , Pincus ) examine relation EER CHR use pH-metry . These study suggest fact EER may consider negative prognostic factor point view early recurrence nasal polyposis endonasal surgery . Also EPOS recommend study conduct regard topic . The aim propose work define , use measurement nasopharyngeal pH Restech system ( accurate sensitive pH-metry ) , often pathological EER present patient CHR . At time determine relation among EER , CHR asthma bronchiale . A clinical trial exist world literature far . In case confirm relation CHR EER , clinical impact significant , take consideration number patient CHR . Benefits project In case confirm hypothesis EER significantly present patient CHR compare common population , possible expect antireflux therapy may introduce treatment protocol patient . The presumption anti-reflux treatment alleviate patients´ symptom ( nasal patency , secretion ) , possibly also decrease number recurrence necessary reoperations . This decrease risk related surgical procedure improve quality life patient .</detailed_description>
