	<brief_summary>Permanent pacemaker common treatment slow heart beat . In UK 300,000 people pacemaker , year another 36,000 receive . All patient usually see yearly device check . However , pacemaker technology reliable , battery last well 5 year , many patient require pacemaker occasionally back-up . Each visit cost around £200 pacemaker follow-up cost NHS around £50million per year . Most visit involve check battery lead , absence symptom might unnecessary . Pacemaker patient risk develop problem include heart failure put high risk hospitalisation death . For follow-up , mechanism exists identify whether might heart failure , receive new implant , unclear go develop heart failure . Also , whether optimal heart failure treatment multidisciplinary team reduces chance hospitalise also unproven . Our study therefore three main aim : 1 ) base pace indication patient factor , identify patient likely develop complication therefore patient could see less frequently ; 2 ) validate refine simple risk score help identify patient pace clinic undergo screen heart failure ; 3 ) establish whether screen subsequent optimisation heart failure clinically cost-effective reduce hospitalisation death .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Permanent pacemaker implantation safe , life-prolonging cost-effective treatment bradycardia . An estimated 300,000 people UK pacemaker 36,000 new implant per year . Complications pacemaker implantation occur 5-15 % patient , mostly first six week . After six month new problem rare . Clinic follow-up patient PPM usually occur six week , three month annually monitor battery performance . Reprogramming rarely require , batteries reliably last least five year . The tariff pacemaker follow-up £200 cost National Health Service ( NHS ) £50 million per year . The common under-recognised long-term complication pacemaker implantation pacemaker-related chronic heart failure ( CHF ) due leave ventricular systolic dysfunction , see 50 % patient . Published data examine incidence association pacemaker-related cardiac dysfunction consist retrospective cross-sectional analysis data take study rather a-priori planned analysis . Our unique pilot data almost 500 patient show cardiac dysfunction present 40 % pacemaker patient confirm previous suggestion common patient underlying predisposition , example cardiovascular co-morbidities ( include diabetes mellitus ) , high rate pace atrial fibrillation . Our data also demonstrate patient cardiac dysfunction pacemaker usually take optimal medical therapy heart failure suffer 13 % annual combine heart failure hospitalisation death rate ( compare 6 % pacemaker patient without cardiac dysfunction , ~8 % patient CHF attend Leeds Integrated Heart Failure Service ) . However , since patient pacemaker often exclude large study medical ( device ) therapy CHF , unclear whether optimisation medical ( pacemaker ) therapy patient pacemaker-related cardiac dysfunction reduce mortality hospitalisation . Pilot data clinic 25 patient pacemaker CHF , show optimise medical therapy lead similar improvement cardiac function CHF patient without pacemaker . The present project therefore include three distinct , closely related , work package answer three question ; 1. patient receive first pacemaker , clinical pacing variable predict short , medium long-term complication therefore feasible , safe cost-effective individualise follow-up interval ; 2. confirm validate previous observation model consist simple clinical pacing variable identifies pacemaker patient high risk cardiac dysfunction pacemaker-follow-up appointment ; 3. apply risk model subsequent optimisation medication pacemaker program within multidisciplinary heart failure service heart failure lead cost effective clinically relevant reduction mortality hospitalisation ?</detailed_description>
