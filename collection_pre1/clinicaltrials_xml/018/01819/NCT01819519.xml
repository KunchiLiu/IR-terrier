	<detailed_description>The study randomize single-masked clinical trial behavioral intervention versus standard care pregnant woman lack evidence acute CMV infection consent screened part Maternal Fetal Medicine Units Network multi-centered randomize clinical trial , pregnant woman screen CMV serology IgM , IgG , IgG avidity . Eligible pregnant woman randomize one two treatment group : - Control Group - intervention - Intervention Group - brief intervention educational material Written inform consent obtain patient screen study CMV testing ( IgM , IgG , IgG avidity ) per protocol screen MFMU study . All woman present prenatal care later 20 week gestational age without know multifetal gestation eligible CMV screen Those evidence primary infection offer participation MFMU randomize trial CMV hyperimmune globulin prevent congenital infection . Women lack evidence acute infection eligible randomization study . Patients must randomize later 20 week gestation . If eligible 20 week gestation , patient randomize . If patient randomize control group , continue routine prenatal care inclusive CDC brochure receive time venipuncture serologic screen assessment hygiene behavior . If patient randomize intervention group , deliver face-face educational intervention next routine prenatal visit . In addition intervention , patient include educational material take home . Both group assess performance hygiene behavior baseline assessment time consent . A second assessment occur least 12 week enrollment third trim 28-36 week gestation .
