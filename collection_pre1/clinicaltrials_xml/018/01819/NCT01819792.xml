	<detailed_description>Bacterial fungal infection treatment well define guideline . Few data available viral infection concern essentially allogeneic stem cell transplantation . These infection associate high mortality morbidity rate . Data concern AML essentially retrospective , pediatric little number patient . Respiratory viral infection incidence know . These infection may responsible high mortality rate . Different risk factor find : age superior 65 year , lymphopenia , co-infections . Treatment subject controversy : surveillance start antiviral therapy . This study aim understand viral infection epidemiology long term aplasia optimize management .</detailed_description>
