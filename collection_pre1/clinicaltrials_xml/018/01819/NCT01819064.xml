	<brief_summary>An infants heart rate important ensures blood pump organ body . Heart rate may decrease anesthesia surgery , anesthesiologist often give medication prevent happen . The common drug purpose call atropine . The dose drug give baby base upon baby 's weight , believe dose atropine less 0.1mg . However evidence support minimum dose . A large dose atropine may cause fast heart rate instead . Anesthesiologists routinely dose atropine base upon baby 's weight without regard minimum dose . The purpose present study measure heart rate dos atropine neonates infant receive less 0.1 mg .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Heart Rate Response Atropine Doses Less Than 0.1mg IV Anesthetized Infants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>60 neonate infant , ASA physical status I II , undergo elective surgical procedure enrol sign informed parental consent . All child fast accord institutional guideline unpremedicated . After arrive operating room , EKG , pulse oximeter blood pressure monitor apply ( Datex-Ohmeda Aisys ) . Anesthesia induce 66 % N2O O2 8 % sevoflurane . Respiration support properly size face mask he/she allow breath spontaneously . Respiration continue spontaneously facemask 2 MAC sevoflurane 66 % N2O . All child position supine , warm force air warmer give 20 ml/kg IV balance salt solution 30 minute IV establish . The end-tidal pCO2 maintain 35-45 mmHg oxygen saturation &gt; 96 % . After 22 24G IV cannula insert , 0.005 mg/kg atropine administer intravenously 5 second fast-flowing IV follow 5 ml normal saline flush IV deadspace . The study ( ECG record ) period extend 30 second atropine administration 5 minute injection . During time heart rate rhythm ( lead II ) monitor record continuously use analogue interface system . EKG record paper continuously 330 second study . The record analyzed heart rate ( base R-R interval ) arrhythmia physician blind study . Blinding mean individual unaware hypothesis study medication administer account change heart rate . Bradycardia define 20 % reduction baseline heart rate tachycardia heart rate &gt; 160 beats/minute ( 6 ) . Any heart rate &lt; 100/minute consider bradycardia age group . Arrhythmia disorder rhythm rate observe . These summarized child . All heart rate response record review . The time record heart rate atropine , occur surgery , add less 5 additional minute anesthetic since overlap time take surgical preparatory event . The blood pressure monitor non-invasively immediately receive atropine one five minute give . The primary outcome incidence bradycardia first 5 minute atropine determine review electrocardiogram . All continuous data report mean +/- standard deviation .</detailed_description>
