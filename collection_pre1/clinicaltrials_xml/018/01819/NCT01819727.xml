	<brief_summary>The BMN 165 clinical development program design demonstrate safety efficacy BMN 165 reduce blood Phe concentration patient 18 70 year old hyperphenylalaninemia due PKU . Study BMN 165-301 Phase 3 , open-label , randomize study design characterize safety BMN 165 two induction , titration , maintenance dose regimens adult PKU previous exposure BMN 165 ( naive ) . Subjects randomize ( 1:1 ) titrate one two dose regimen . Other key feature study dose regimen choose induction titration ; study duration ; self administration study drug ; choose tertiary objective .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open-Label Phase 3 Study BMN 165 Adults With PKU Not Previously Treated w/ BMN 165</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Secondary Outcomes : The primary objective study follow : - To characterize safety tolerability induction , titration , maintenance dose BMN 165-naïve subject self administer BMN 165 dose level 20 mg/day 40 mg/day The secondary objective study follow : - To evaluate blood Phe concentration induction , titration , maintenance dose BMN 165-naïve subject self administer BMN 165 dose level 20 mg/day 40 mg/day The tertiary objective study follow : - To characterize protein intake medical food natural protein BMN 165-naïve subject administer BMN 165 dose level 20 mg/day 40 mg/day - To characterize baseline ADHD-like symptom BMN 165-naïve subject - To evaluate trough plasma concentration BMN 165 BMN 165-naïve subject administer BMN 165 dose level 20 mg/day 40 mg/day Primary Analysis : All AEs cod use Medical Dictionary Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) . The incidence AEs summarize system organ class , preferred term , relationship study drug , severity subject randomize 40 mg/day dose , 20 mg/day dose , overall . A by-subject listing provided subject experience SAE , include death , experience AE associate early withdrawal study study drug . Hypersensitivity AEs AEs result dose interruption dose reduction interest , percentage subject report AEs present . Clinical laboratory data summarize type laboratory test subject randomize 40 mg/day dose , 20 mg /day dose , overall . Frequency percentage subject experience abnormal ( ie , outside reference range ) and/or clinically significant abnormality study drug administration present clinical laboratory test . For clinical laboratory test , descriptive statistic provide baseline subsequent post-baseline visit . Changes baseline post-baseline visit also provide . Descriptive statistic , include clinically significant change baseline , vital sign , physical examination result , ECG test result , immunogenicity test result also provide similar manner . Additionally , antibodies titer summarize scheduled time point . Detailed statistical method provide Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP ) . Secondary Analysis : The secondary efficacy endpoint change baseline end study blood Phe concentration . Baseline define average blood Phe concentration collect prior dose Screening Visit Day 1 . The primary analysis method secondary endpoint use repeat measure model , change baseline Phe dependent variable dose ( 40 mg/day 20 mg/day ) , study week , baseline Phe independent variable . A responder analysis present cumulative distribution function . The percentage subject blood Phe concentration `` X '' umol/L end study plot summarized various `` X '' cumulative distribution function 2 dos overall . Detailed statistical method provide SAP . Tertiary Analyses : The statistical analysis method tertiary endpoint ( protein intake ; ADHD-RS IV score ) descriptive . More detail regard analysis method tertiary endpoint provide SAP . Trough plasma concentration BMN 165 evaluate . DMC The Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) act advisory capacity BioMarin monitor subject safety efficacy BMN 165 subject participate Study BMN 165-301 .The DMC responsibility may include follow : - Review study protocol , informed consent assent document , plan data monitor - Evaluate progress trial ; study data quality ; timeliness ; subject recruitment , accrual retention ; subject ' risk versus benefit ; factor could affect study outcome - Consider relevant information may effect safety participant ethic study - Protect safety study participant accordance stop rule define study protocol - Make recommendation BioMarin concern continuation termination study modification study base observation - If appropriate , conduct interim analysis safety efficacy</detailed_description>
