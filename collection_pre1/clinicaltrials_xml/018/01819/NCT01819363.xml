	<detailed_description>1 . PURPOSE To analyze correlation pleural elastance radiological effectiveness ( measure chest tomography ) pleurodesis perform via catheter patient RMPE . The secondary objective study : correlate pleural elastance quality life , analysis dyspnea pain procedure , clinical effectiveness , complication mortality 30 day . 2 . METHODS Patients participate study select Pleural Diseases Clinic Department Thoracic Surgery Department Pulmonology Medical School USP . Shall deem elected patient : malignant pleural effusion diagnose pleural fluid cytology / pleural biopsy ; recurrent pleural effusion ( new accumulation fluid puncture ) symptom ( dyspnea / chest pain ) ; parcial lung expansion ( &gt; 50 % ) puncture empty confirm chest radiography ; Karnofsky index ( KPS - Karnofsky Performance Status ) &gt; 30 ; agree participate study sign inform consent . The investigator include 140 patient study , predict loss patient . 3 . PROCEDURE After insertion tube , fix skin nonabsorbable suture wound covered bandage . The catheter connect three-way stopcock . On output side connect delivery unit measure central venous pressure gear connect electronic transducer vascular pressure . In output connect distal extension tube proximal end valve distal end Heimlich connect collection bag . The pleural pressure level zero time insertion site drain skin . The pleural pressure set value measure end-expiration . The pleural pressure measure baseline , withdrawal 10 ml liquid thereafter every 400 ml pleural effusion evacuate pressure negative , moment measurement occur every 200 ml pleural effusion drain obtain 800 ml liquid . Patients remove less 800 ml liquid exclude protocol . The pleural elastance calculate cm H2O / L data place pressure curve volume . A chest radiograph perform patient eligible pleurodesis lung expansion allow contact pleural surface , even partially . The eligible patient pleurodesis refer outpatient procedure room remain ward bed , , sterile condition submit instillation silver nitrate talc mineral . Analgesia give necessary . The drain keep close one hour , period , drain open patient discharge instructed return within 1 week outpatient case . A CT chest hold near-pleurodesis , patient still drain maximum five day pleurodesis . In outpatient possible complication evaluate . The drain remove less 100 ml/day pleural fluid drain . After removal drain schedule one month return clinical evaluation another CT scan chest . Since return quarterly . In return evaluate chest radiograph , questionnaires quality life , dyspnea pain shall apply actively investigated occurrence complication . Patients fail attend consultation contact phone . Non-scheduled query occur case clinical necessity ( relapse , complication , etc . Blinding The investigator make measurement pleural elastance follow patient . Researchers make assessment patient CT scan chest drainage pleurodesis blind measurement pleural elastance . 4 . OUTCOMES 4.1 ) RADIOLOGICAL EFFECTIVE In study , effectiveness measure radiographic tomography chest . Will measure volume pleural fluid chest CT placement drain 1 month pleurodesis . The patient subject computed tomography chest without contrast . This measured volume pleural fluid . With use axial slice , stipulate every 2 cm segment . Will calculate area occupied pleural effusion . Multiplying height 2 cm approximate volume segment . Be inferred approximate volume pleural effusion add volume segment 2 cm . The unit volume milliliter . The difference volumes 1 month near-pleurodesis indicate much re-accumulation fluid pleural space , thus provide numerical value relate numerical value pleural elastance . In case recurrence within 30 day , TC hold value consider post-pleurodesis . 4.2 ) CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS In study , clinical effectiveness consider binary variable ( success failure ) . We consider failure pleurodesis , time follow-up procedure necessary new procedure empty pleural effusion , puncture , drainage thoracoscopy . Such procedure shall appoint surgical team Pleural Diseases Clinic HCFMUSP consider clinical criterion ( symptom : dyspnea , cough chest pain ) radiological ( new fluid accumulation chest tomography ) . 4.3 ) ANALYSIS OF QUALITY OF LIFE To analyze quality life investigator use WHOQoL-Bref . The WHOQOL-Bref reduce version questionnaire quality life develop World Health Organization multi-cultural context , aim cover many country culture possible thus use internationally , allow comparison result obtain different location . This questionnaire validate Portuguese language cover follow area : quality life general health ( scored patient ) , physical , psychological , social environmental . This questionnaire previously use analysis quality life pleurodesis apply investigator initial evaluation , return one month procedure quarterly . 4.4 ) ANALYSIS OF PAIN Pain assessment make patient´s quantify Visual Analog Scale Pain . The questionnaire apply investigator initial evaluation , return one month procedure quarterly . 4.5 ) ANALYSIS OF DYSPNEA The analysis dyspnea make quantify functionality dyspnea scale British Medical Research Council ( MRC ) . The questionnaire apply investigator initial evaluation , return one month procedure quarterly . 4.6 ) SECURITY ANALYSIS For analysis safety procedure shall deem time hospitalization drainage occurrence complication . Such data obtain inpatient outpatient follow-up previously describe . The expected complication , actively investigate , group 's experience literature fever , bleeding , infection ( pulmonary / pleural ) , abdominal pain , prolong drainage ( &gt; 10 day ) , air leak , subcutaneous emphysema , respiratory failure , reexpansion edema death related procedure . Other complication record occurrence grade accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events v3.0 ( CTCAE ) . 5 - DATA COLLECTION Initial Assessment Will collect follow data : age , sex , primary tumor number puncture . All data include spreadsheet program SPSS ( Chicago , IL ) patient ' name delete completion collection . During initial assessment also fill questionnaire quality life WHO-Qol , MRC dyspnea scale Visual Analog Scale Pain . During pleural drainage collect initial data PP , intermediate final calculate elastance pleural space Follow-up After chest tube removal patient return month every three month symptom . In case non-attendance , telephone contact establish , case death , date note purpose construction survival curve . In returns clinical data annotate seek occurrence complication . The quality life questionnaire use soon new chest X-rays perform . Examinations additional consultation conduct accord clinical need . 6 ) ANALYSIS OF OUTCOMES Radiation Effectiveness The difference pleural volume 30 day peri-pleurodesis correlate measured pleural elastance . The significance correlation evaluate use Pearson correlation coefficient . Will consider significant p &lt; 0.05 . Will use establish linear regression equation predict volume pleural fluid reacúmulo expect base measured pleural elastance . Clinical Effectiveness The clinical effectiveness consider categorical value correlate pleural elastance . The significance correlation assess Spearman test . Will consider significant p &lt; 0.05 . Try Doc curve area curve value elastance set reduced clinical effectiveness . Quality Life The difference score questionnaire quality life four area pleurodesis shall correlate pleural elastance . The significance correlation assess Pearson correlation coefficient . Will consider significant p &lt; 0.05 . Pain The difference pain score questionnaire pleurodesis shall correlate pleural elastance . The significance correlation evaluate use Pearson correlation coefficient . Will consider significant p &lt; 0.05 . Dyspnea Dyspnea consider categorical value correlate pleural elastance . The significance correlation assess Spearman test . Will consider significant p &lt; 0.05 . Complications Complications consider categorical value ( score ≥ 3 ≤ 2 CTCAE ) correlate pleural elastance . The significance correlation assess Spearman test . Will consider significant p &lt; 0.05 . 6.3 ) SURVIVAL A survival curve construct consider pleurodesis initial time death event . Censored undergone event end time analysis . Cox regression hold relevance follow factor mortality : pleural elastance , KPS primary neoplasm . Methodology The measurement partial elastance ( first 800 ml ) total value change , since pressure x volume curve always monophasic . The investigator measure pressure end withdrawal liquid analyze total elastance , note whether significant change . Pleural pressure measurement water column pressure transducer vascular superimposable . Therefore , investigator n't see problem measure pleural pressure different method , depend non-availability transducer clinic ward hospital .</detailed_description>
