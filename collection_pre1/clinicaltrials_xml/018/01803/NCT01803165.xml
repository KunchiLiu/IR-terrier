	<brief_summary>In investigation , investigator attempt demonstrate patient receive nerve block ( regional anesthesia ) prior open surgical vascular bypass low extremity ( infrainguinal bypass graft ) improve surgical outcome namely reduction rate death , wound infection , graft thrombosis , graft revision , amputation . As well , investigator anticipate patient undergone regional anesthesia infrainguinal bypass graft improve secondary outcome respect decrease length stay , narcotic consumption , nausea vomiting , post-operative cognitive dysfunction , major cardiac event , post-operative pain , hyperglycemic episode .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lower Extremity Regional Anesthesia Infrainguinal Bypass Grafting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background The post-operative benefit regional anesthesia describe patient undergo vascular access surgery ( 1 , 2 ) . Some benefit identify improved vascular flow , decreased thrombosis rate , early maturation graft ( 2 ) . It speculate benefit mainly attribute sympathetic blockade regional anesthesia . Recent literature review identify prior study attempt prospectively identify improve surgical outcome patient undergo revascularization surgery regional anesthesia utilized . However , Kashyap et al . report regional anesthesia may decrease incidence perioperative thrombosis patient undergone infra-popliteal revascularization surgery 20 year period ( 3 ) . In investigation attempt ascertain whether improved surgical outcome namely reduction rate death , wound infection , graft thrombosis , graft revision , amputation . As well , anticipate patient undergone regional anesthesia infrainguinal bypass graft improve secondary outcome respect decrease length stay , narcotic consumption , nausea vomiting , post-operative cognitive dysfunction , major cardiac event , post-operative pain , hyperglycemic episode . Methods After Investigational Review Board approval , write informed consent obtain 20 patient undergoing fem-popliteal bypass surgery University Nebraska Medical Center enrol prospective cohort registry . Patients exclude study age le 19 year , allergy amide anesthetic , inability undergo general anesthesia , acute limb ischemia , existence contraindication regional anesthesia presence antiplatelet anticoagulative drug , evidence gross neurological dysfunction lower extremity . Baseline health data patient record . Ultrasound perform linear 10- 13-Megahertz probe perform nerve block . Standard American Society Anesthesiology monitor apply patient sedate discretion anesthetic team . Complications vascular puncture , pain injection , systemic toxicity record . A perineural dose regimen regional block follow : ( femoral block ) 20cc 0.5 % ropivicaine ( sub-gluteal posterior sciatic block ) 20cc 0.2 % ropivicaine . Epinephrine withhold local anesthetic order prevent potential ischemic complication . The patient undergo general anesthesia discretion anesthetic team . Any anesthetic surgical complication record OR interval . The type graft utilize specific location arterial intervention record . Following surgery , patient monitor data record daily patient recover hospital . Primary outcome record include : death , wound infection , graft thrombosis , graft revision , amputation . Secondary outcome record pain score , nausea vomiting , 24 hour narcotic consumption , graft failure ( define occlusion require return operate room ) , related return OR index procedure , major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) , administration warfarin antiplatelet medication , average 24 hour blood sugar , creatinine level , postoperative cognitive dysfunction , requirement supplemental oxygen upon discharge PACU . As well , patient query resumption tobacco product . The patient 's length hospital stay record . On discharge continue surveillance follow primary outcome : death , wound infection , graft thrombosis , graft revision , amputation . The secondary outcome record follow : presence pain rest , pain ambulation , continue administration anticoagulant antiplatelets , graft failure ( define occlusion require return operate room ) , related return OR index procedure , major adverse cardiac event ( MACE ) , average 24 hour blood sugar , creatinine level , ankle brachial pressure index ( ABPI ) doppler ultrasound report record . Also , patient query resumption tobacco product . These observation record post-operative day 7 , 31 , 93 . A comparison group patient ( N=20 ) undergo infra-inguinal bypass grafting obtain retrospective chart review . Patients undergone regional neuroaxial anesthesia bypass procedure exclude . As well , patient match cohort age , sex , health comorbidities include : Congestive heart failure , smoking , diabetes , renal dysfunction , chronic anticoagulant antiplatelet medication administration . The primary secondary outcome data obtain prospective portion study seek record chart review . Conclusion Improved vascular surgical outcome describe patient receive regional anesthesia neuroaxial anesthesia ( 2-4 ) . Specifically , anticipate decrease overall rate death , wound infection , graft thrombosis , graft revision , amputation patient receive regional anesthesia infra-inguinal bypass grafting . As well , hypothesize patient receive regional anesthestics improve secondary outcome include decreased length stay , narcotic consumption , nausea vomiting , post-operative cognitive dysfunction , cardiac event , post-operative pain , hyperglycemic episode .</detailed_description>
