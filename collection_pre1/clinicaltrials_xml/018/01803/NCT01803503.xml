	<brief_summary>This study aim find whether effect docetaxel chemotherapy may improve combine another anti-cancer drug call sunitinib , stop blood vessel grow ( anti-angiogenic agent ) . Sunitinib oral anti-angiogenic drug approve treatment kidney cancer , rare form soft tissue tumor call gastrointestinal stromal tumor , rare form cancer pancreas call pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor . Sunitinib usually give continuously dose 37.5mg ( 3 pill ) daily either alone combination chemotherapy . However , study show continuous administration sunitinib may reduce chemotherapy effectiveness . On hand , short course sunitinib chemotherapy cycle may sensitize tumor chemotherapy . This treatment strategy use patient different kind cancer commonly use chemotherapy drug , docetaxel . Ths study aim evaluate intermittent administration low dose sunitinib docetaxel chemotherapy improve treatment response cancer patient . Study Hypothesis : Low dose , short course sunitinib 12.5mg daily orally 1 week prior chemotherapy normalize tumor vasculature enhance delivery chemotherapy tumor , improve treatment response progression-free survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel With Without Low-dose , Short Course Sunitinib Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single-centre , phase II randomize study . Eligible patient randomize docetaxel without intermittent sunitinib . A total eighty patient measurable tumor enrol period 24-36 month . Eligible patient randomize 1:1 either arm A arm B . Patients stratify accord site primary tumor ( breast v non-small cell lung cancer v others ) randomization purpose . Arm A ( Control arm ) : Docetaxel 75mg/m2 day 1 , every 3 week Arm B ( Experimental arm ) : Docetaxel 75mg/m2 day 1 , every 3 week , precede 7 day sunitinib 12.5mg orally daily cycle . Patients treat maximum 6 cycle chemotherapy absence tumor progression unacceptable toxicity . Patient evaluate weekly toxicity assessment full blood count cycle 1 , day 1 15 subsequent cycle .</detailed_description>
