	<brief_title>Feasibility Campaign Intervention Compared Standard Behavioral Weight Loss Intervention Overweight Obese Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The feasibility solely use campaign intervention ( CI ) promote healthy eating physical activity behavior weight loss weight maintenance examine systematic manner . Thus , primary aim study examine whether stand-alone CI result similar weight loss compare standard behavioral weight loss intervention ( SBWL ) . It hypothesize CI achieve similar weight loss compare SBWL . Additional aim include examination CI change moderate vigorous intensity physical activity , dietary intake , self-monitoring dietary intake physical activity , weight loss self-efficacy , motivation compare SBWL . This study recruit forty-eight sedentary , overweight obese adult men woman , participate behavioral weight loss intervention University Pittsburgh Physical Activity Weight Management Research Center ( PAWMRC ) . To consider eligible study , participant must 18-55 year age , Body Mass Index ( BMI ) range ≥25.0 kg/m² 45.0 kg/m² . Assessments conduct week 0 12 intervention . Each assessment take approximately 30 minute complete include height , body weight , assessment physical activity , dietary intake , weight loss self-efficacy , motivation . Upon successful completion baseline assessment , eligible subject randomly assign one two group use stratified randomized block design : 1 ) standard behavioral weight loss intervention ( SBWL ) 2 ) campaign intervention ( CI ) . The CI target specific diet physical activity behavior improve weight loss effort within thematic framework base professional auto race point system concept . CI session content target behavior goal tie overall theme throughout campaign participant opportunity earn incentive reinforce positive behavior change . This study necessary first step examine feasibility stand-alone campaign alternative strategy weight management compare standard behavioral weight loss intervention . Furthermore , study provide variance estimate effectiveness campaign intervention compare standard behavioral weight loss program use determine appropriate sample size future full-scale clinical study alternative strategy .</detailed_description>
