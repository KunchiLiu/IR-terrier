	<brief_summary>Measuring spine dynamic necessity order well understand gait deviation throughout whole body evaluate treatment effect spinal movement gait . However , full body marker set typically use opto-electronic 3D gait analysis either disregard spine entirely regard rigid structure . Therefore , purpose study use enhance trunk marker set order evaluate biomechanical effect low extremity treatment spine dynamic patient different pathology . It hypothesize 1. enhanced trunk marker set reliable method measurement spine dynamic gait patient deviation occur secondary leg length inequality . 2. enhance trunk marker set reliable method measurement spine dynamic gait patient present primary secondary deviation see hemiplegic diplegic cerebral palsy . 3. treatment mean either shoe insole modify shoe sole lift short side effect spine dynamic gait patient leg length inequality . 4. treatment mean ankle foot orthosis control foot position effect spine dynamic gait patient hemiplegic diplegic cerebral palsy . To verify hypothesis , instrument gait analyse standard full body marker set enhance trunk marker set carry immediately orthotic low extremity treatment respective patient group .</brief_summary>
