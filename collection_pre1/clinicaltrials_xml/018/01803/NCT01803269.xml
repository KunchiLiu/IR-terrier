	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well give topotecan hydrochloride cyclodextrin-based polymer-camptothecin CRLX101 work treat patient recurrent small cell lung cancer . Drugs use chemotherapy , topotecan hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Cyclodextrin-based polymer-camptothecin CRLX101 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether topotecan hydrochloride effective cyclodextrin-based polymer-camptothecin CRLX101 treating patient lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Topotecan Hydrochloride Cyclodextrin-Based Polymer-Camptothecin CRLX101 Treating Patients With Recurrent Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate effect second-line treatment CRLX101 ( cyclodextrin-based polymer-camptothecin CRLX101 ) compare intravenous ( IV ) topotecan hydrochloride ( topotecan ) progression free survival ( PFS ) patient extensive-stage small cell lung cancer ( ES-SCLC ) sensitive first-line platinum-based chemotherapy . II . To evaluate effect second-line treatment CRLX101 three-month PFS rate patient ES-SCLC resistant first-line platinum-based chemotherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response rate second-line treatment CRLX101 patient ES-SCLC sensitive resistant first-line platinum-based chemotherapy . II . To evaluate effect second-line treatment CRLX101 compare IV topotecan overall survival ( OS ) patient ES-SCLC sensitive first-line platinum-based chemotherapy . III . To assess overall survival second-line treatment CRLX101 patient ES-SCLC resistant first-line platinum-based chemotherapy . IV . To assess toxicity second-line CRLX101 patient sensitive resistant first-line platinum-based chemotherapy . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 cohort . COHORT A ( Sensitive Relapse ) : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive topotecan hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1-5 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients receive cyclodextrin-based polymer-camptothecin CRLX101 IV 60 minute day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . COHORT B ( Resistant Relapse ) : Patients receive cyclodextrin-based polymer-camptothecin CRLX101 Arm B Cohort A . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 3 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
