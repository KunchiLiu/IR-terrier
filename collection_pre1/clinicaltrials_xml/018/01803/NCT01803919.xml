	<brief_title>Efficacy Study Antimicrobial Catheters Avoid Urinary Infections Spinal Cord Injured Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Antiseptic Silver Alloy-Coated Silicone Urinary Catheters seem promise intervention reduce urinary tract infection ; however , research evidence extrapolate spinal cord injure patient . The study open , randomize , multicentric , parallel clinical trial blind assessment . The study include spinal cord injure patient require least seven day urethral catheterization method bladder void . Participants on-line centrally randomize allocate one two intervention ( Antiseptic Urinary Catheters Conventional Catheters ) . Catheters use maximum period 30 day remove earlier clinician criterion . The main outcome incidence urinary tract infection time catheter removal day 30 catheterization , event occurs first . Intention-to-treat analysis perform , well primary analysis patient . The aim study ass whether silver alloy-coated silicone urinary catheter reduce urinary infection spinal cord injure patient .</detailed_description>
