	<brief_summary>Abnormalities structural functional connectivity brain region suggest putative biomarkers mild traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) significant contributor neuropsychological functioning injury outcome . The purpose study use two advanced magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) technique call diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI ) rest state functional MRI compare structural functional connectivity individual document mild TBI healthy control . To evaluate significance structural functional connectivity behavior , brain imaging data related measure cognition emotion . Over 4-year period , 150 adult document mild TBI 30 healthy control participate study . The study investigate follow question hypothesis : 1 . Evaluate DWI metric fractional anisotropy ( FA ) measure white matter integrity across multiple stage recovery follow mild TBI relative healthy control . It hypothesize mild TBI associate great white matter abnormality healthy control . 2 . It hypothesize relationship FA , cognition emotion function injury . 3 . It hypothesize functional connectivity relate FA .</brief_summary>
