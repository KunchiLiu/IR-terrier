	<brief_summary>The purpose institutional protocol offer SBRT select patient control environment refine treatment technique ( include dose/fractionation schedule ) standardize follow-up . SBRT clinical use decade institution available data suggest use safely good result . This study see effective Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy treating tumour lung often people side effect . Radiation therapy usually give day , often week . In study , study participant receive high dos radiation treatment tumour lung 3 10 treatment session total 1 2 week . Several report indicate therapy might shrink tumour control cancer extend period time . Although specialist start treat patient SBRT 10 year ago , still use relatively cancer centre .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Stereotactic Radiotherapy ( SBRT ) Lung Metastasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>SBRT adaptation principle experience gain stereotactic brain RT . SBRT develop early 90 Karolinska Institute Stockholm , Sweden , use accepted alternative treatment patient early stage lung cancer many center Japan number center Germany , USA elsewhere . It also use patient lung metastasis extra-thoracic disease ( primary metastatic ) . Many report indicate excellent local control ( 80-90 % high ) minimal toxicity well select patient treat thoracic SBRT . SBRT traditionally follow feature : 1 . High dos radiation , usually large fraction ( `` hypofractionated '' compare standard radiotherapy schedule ) 2 . Multiple radiation beam come different direction plane ( 'co-planar ' beam ) well different direction different plane relative patient 's body ( 'non-coplanar ' beam ) 3 . Stereotactic beam placement , guide set coordinate These coordinate define relationship precise location tumor , determine medical imaging ( e.g . CT , MRI ) , rather set external mark ( tattoo ) anatomical landmark ( bony structure )</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histological confirmation malignancy , unless risk biopsy unacceptable lesion grow serial CT scan and/or PET positive . Eligible patient must stag study ( e.g . chest radiograph , CT scan , MRI/CT Brain/Bone Scan ) identifying : patient stage I II , nonmetastatic NSCLC ( T1 , N0 , M0 ; T2 , N0 , M0 ; T3 , N0 , M0 chest wall primary tumor ) patient nonlung primary control metastasized lung alone , potentially curative surgery would otherwise option ( e.g . colorectal , breast , sarcoma…etc ) subset patient limit ( low ) volume metastatic NSCLC primary site tumor felt may derive benefit highdose SBRT treatment primary metastatic lung tumor . And sit metastatic disease treat desire achieve long term control . Lesions must meet size criterion 4.1.2.1 Patients potentially resectable disease consider medically inoperable , else judgement thoracic surgeon lung team , surgery consider preferred management option Early stage lung cancer : ≤3 parenchymal lung lesion , Metastatic disease lung : ≤5 parenchymal lung lesion Patients early stage primary NSCLC hilar mediastinal lymph node consider N0 clinicoradiological ground ( i.e . clinicoradiological evidence lymph node spread ) In patient early stage primary NSCLC coexisting malignancy , coexist malignancy must expect prognosis well primary lung lesion Adequate lung function tolerate plan stereotactic radiation Previous conventional RT mediastinum/lung allow long SBRT expect high probability impair lung function Must ≥ 18 year age Zubrod performance status must 0 3 Women child bear potential male participant must use effective contraceptive method Willing able give inform consent Patients active systemic , pulmonary pericardial infection No concurrent systemic therapy ( chemotherapy , immunotherapy biological therapy ) , apart hormone therapy , allow History active autoimmune disease , include systemic lupus erythematous , rheumatoid arthritis , C.R.E.S.T. , systemic sclerosis , scleroderma Potential candidate concurrent chemoradiation therapy Patient enrollment study may permissible .
