	<brief_summary>The main aim study investigate , human , effect plant sterols vascular function measure flow-mediated dilation ( FMD ) . This study also aim study effect plant sterols pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) , aortic augmentation index ( Aix ) , central blood pressure ( CBP ) , office blood pressure ( BP ) , blood lipid plasma plant sterol concentration . At last , effect plant sterols z-scores circulate biomarkers endothelial dysfunction low-grade inflammation assess . For study outcome , effect size 95 % confidence interval estimate . Hypothesis : Based available evidence , hypothesize plant sterol modestly increase FMD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Plant sterol well know LDL-cholesterol lowering benefit . Elevated cholesterol especially LDL-cholesterol concentration establish risk factor coronary heart disease ( CHD ) reduce concentration dietary modification drug treatment show reduce risk CHD . Direct evidence support reduce risk CHD far generate . Investigating effect consume plant sterol intermediate risk factor beyond cholesterol-lowering therefore warrant .</detailed_description>
