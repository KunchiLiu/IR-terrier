	<brief_summary>This study design develop Emilia Romania research innovation program ( PRI ER ) . The study commercial sponsor come independent study provide Ministerial Decree 17.12.2005 . The PRI ER program guarantee contribution study first three year recruitment regional Innovation Fund , cover cost coordination data management sustain Coordinating Center . Primary Objectives The study propose evaluate whether partial hypofractionated accelerated irradiation sole surgical cavity , patient suffer breast cancer low risk local recurrence undergo conservative surgery , inferior postoperative irradiation conventional fractionation entire breast regard local control ( incidence ipsilateral recurrence prime event ) . Secondary Objectives Comparison global survival , freedom locoregional recurrence ( exception contralateral tumor second tumor ) , distant relapse-free ( except local regional relapse contralateral breast ) patient treat conventional radiotherapy accelerate partial radiation . To evaluate whether accelerated partial irradiation offer cosmetic result , acute toxicity comparable conventional irradiation . Possible connection national international study Similar study nonetheless evaluate different method partial irradiation currently underway . Study Design Multicenter phase III control randomize , unblinded study non-inferiority . Number case Recruitment 3302 patient plan . Target Population Study Women age = &gt; 49 , ECOG 0-2 , undergo conservative breast surgery invasive breast cancer , pT 1-2 ( &lt; 3 cm diameter ) pN0-N1 M0 , unifocal , resection margin histologically negative ( ³ 2 mm ) first intervention subsequent widening . Duration recruitment subsequent follow-up A recruitment 8 year plan follow-up period 5 year overall duration study 13 year . Treatment The patient randomize receive one follow treatment : Trial arm 38.5 Gy total 10 fraction ( 3.85 Gy per fraction ) , twice day interval least 6 hour two fraction , five consecutive working day . Control arm 50.0 Gy 25 fraction ( 2 Gy per fraction ) , day 5 day week . Endpoints Primary : survival free local ipsilateral recurrence prime event Secondary : global survival , locoregional recurrence-free , distant recurrence-free , acute late toxicity ( RTOG ) cosmetic result . Evaluation Follow-Up Program Controls plan radiotherapy , end treatment , 6 week , 3-6-12 month end radiotherapy year end 5 year . Data Analysis Partial irradiation consider inferior standard irradiation top extreme HR confidence interval 95 % ( endpoint ) exceed establish value 1.5 The study size relation rate local ipsilateral breast recurrence prime event 5 year assume rate standard treatment group 4 % , accept maximum Hazard Ratio inferior 1.5 error b equal respectively 0.05 0.10 test endpoint . The survival calculate use Kaplan-Meier method . The hazard ratio ( HR ) calculate use Cox model confidence interval 95 % report . Ethical Aspects Informed Consent For participation study inform consent plan appropriately draw submit approval Ethics Committees . The clinical study carry accord ethical principle Helsinki Declaration , GCP guideline , Italian law regulatory activity carry clinical study . Before formal commencement study approval/sole opinion reference Ethics Committee propose group stipulate . The individual investigator different participate institution directly responsible submission approval protocol Ethics Committees .</brief_summary>
