	<detailed_description>Pathophysiology diabetic cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) yet unclear gender difference baseline specific treatment indicate . The investigator demonstrate positive impact phosphodiesterase type 5A ( PDE5A ) inhibition men . The investigator ' study aim characterize DCM , measure molecular neuroendocrine assessment relate intramyocardial metabolism cardiac kinetic . The investigator perform randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind study enrol 164 diabetic patient ( female male ) DCM , evaluate gender response 6 month PDE5A inhibitor ( PDE5Ai ) . The investigator ' study describe gender difference DCM feature . The propose research test whether PDE5Ai could become new target antiremodeling drug discover molecular pathway affect class drug network circulate marker early diagnosis , monitor treatment DCM . The investigator allow identify cluster cardiovascular , metabolic oxidative stress marker miRNAs , whose variation together correlate DCM evolution prediction risk response treatment . The investigator evaluate PDE5Ai could become new target antiremodeling drug ; mechanism action direct cardiac tissue , independently secondary effect gender relate difference . Type 2 diabetes mellitus associate cardiac remodeling may occur independently ischemic heart disease , hypertension , macrovascular complication . In vitro study show phosphodiesterase 5 overexpression reduces cGMP level exacerbate remodel . The investigator already studied effect 3-month daily Inhibition cGMP hydrolysis phosphodiesterase 5A inhibitor ( PDE5i ) cardiac remodel cohort asymptomatic , middle-aged men type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) . CMR image reveal diabetic cardiomyopathy patient produce uncoupling left ventricular contraction longitudinal strain , reduce , cardiac axial rotation , increase . Characterized DCM early asymptomatic stage men , identify two circulate marker , TGF-beta MCP-1 increase significantly relate cardiac kinetic parameter . Then , investigator find long-term PDE5i restore couple reduce torsion improve strain . It also reduce ratio leave ventricular mass end-diastolic volume increase presence concentric hypertrophy . Circulating marker TGF-beta MCP-1 , significantly decrease PDE5i vs. Placebo.These data suggest phosphodiesterase 5 inhibition could work antiremodeling drug act directly cardiac tissue , independently secondary vascular , endothelial , metabolic effect . However , data need validate wide sample , long duration treatment , include woman , high vulnerability diabetic damage preferential evolution chronic heart failure , compare male frequently ischemic complication . Recently , animal human study describe gene expression profile associate pathological hypertrophy . In particular , microRNAs ( miRNAs ) alter expression cardiomyocyte ( small RNA molecule involve transcriptional regulation ) [ miR-208/1/133 ] , relate onset hypertrophy . Is unknown whether miRNAs able predict development DCM and/or effectiveness treatment PDE5i T2DM . The investigator hypothesize : - gender difference leave ventricular myocardial remodel T2DM patient detectable tagged-CMR term myocardial strain ventricular torsion - gender-related feature determine different cardiac response PDE5i treatment detect change ventricular contractility ( strain torsion tagged-CMR ) metabolism ( PCr-to-ATP ratio 31P-CMR spectroscopy ) - neuroendocrine ( e.g . natriuretic peptide ) metabolic marker chemokines ( e.g . MCP-1 , TGF-ß ) might identify asymptomatic patient great risk develop LV remodel - neuroendocrine ( e.g . natriuretic peptide ) , metabolic marker chemokines ( e.g . MCP-1 , TGF-ß ) able predict response treatment PDE5i evolution disease - miRNA expression [ miR-208a , 499 , 1 , 133 , 126 , 29 , 233.222 ] predict development evolution cardiac remodel effectiveness treatment PDE5i T2DM patient The aim study : Characterization gender difference DCM remodel cluster biomarkers indicative stage disease CMR quantification kinetic parameter ( myocardial strain , ventricular torsion ) , fibrosis amount ( T1-mapping technique ) metabolism ( PCr-to- ATP ratio , measure 31P-Spectroscopy ) Quantification cluster biomarkers predictive disease progression : metabolic neuroendocrine marker , pro-fibrotic pro-inflammatory circulating chemokines miRNAs Evaluation gender difference anti-remodeling effect PDE5A inhibition T2DM patient Quantification cluster biomarkers predictive anti-remodeling response PDE5Ai chronic administration The investigator perform randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind study enrol 164 patient ( female male ) T2DM diabetic cardiomyopathy . Patients randomize treatment PDE5Ai 5 mg / day placebo 6 consecutive month . The outcome evaluate 1,3 6 month therapy . Cardiovascular ( NT-ProBNP , TGFb , MCP1 ) , endothelial ( ET1 , VEGF , P Selectin , ICAM1 ) metabolic index , oxidative stress marker ( iNOS , COX2 , ROS , RANTES ) evaluate patient related CMR cardiac kinetic metabolic parameter fibrosis order identify : - gender difference cardiac remodel baseline ( overall patient include study ) evolution ( Placebo group ) ; - effectiveness PDE5i administration ( PDE5i group ) potential gender difference response treatment . To identify circulate miRNAs investigator perform specific quantitative Real-Time PCR analysis target expression different mature circulate miRNAs one , three six month PDE5i treatment . In particular investigator analyze panel select miRNAs , include heart-associated ( miR-1 , -133a , -208b , -499 ) , fibrosis-associated ( miR-21 miR-29b ) , leukocyte-associated ( miR-146 , -155 , -223 ) , hyperglycemia-associate ( miR-29 , -222 ) , vascular-associate ( miR-126 ) miRNA . Then , analyze putative gender difference miRNAs expression investigator correlate miRNAs ' expression pattern cardiovascular metabolic feature . CMR assessment perform order identify : - gender difference kinetic parameter leave ventricle ( end-diastolic volume , end-systolic volume , stroke volume , wall motion score index , myocardial strain , torsion angle ) ; - change myocardial fibrosis replacement amount ( global contrast-enhanced T1 relaxation time , percentage myocardial surface area , quantify T1-mapping technique ) ; - change myocardial metabolism ( PCr-to-TP ratio , measure 31P-Spectroscopy ) . All patient present unknown ischemic cardiomyopathy CMR perform baseline exclude study . Evaluation potential toxicity monitor throughout course treatment .</detailed_description>
