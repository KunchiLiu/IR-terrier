	<brief_summary>The full body marker set typically use opto-electronic 3D gait analysis either disregard spine entirely regard rigid structure . Therefore , purpose study identify possibility limitation enhance trunk marker set measurement spine dynamic gait adolescent without structural spine deformity . It hypothesize enhance trunk marker set : 1. valid method measurement spine deformation sagittal , frontal indirectly transverse plane . 2. applicable reliable method measurement spine dynamic gait healthy adolescent patient structural deformity see scoliosis . 3. sensitive enough distinguish spinal movement pattern gait measure scoliosis patient one measure healthy adolescent . To verify hypothesis , follow measurement carry : - Biplanar radiograph ( a-p lateral ) radio-opaque marker scoliosis patient . - Instrumented gait analysis standard full body marker set enhance trunk marker set scoliosis patient healthy control .</brief_summary>
