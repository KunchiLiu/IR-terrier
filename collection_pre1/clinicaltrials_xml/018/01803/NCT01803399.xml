	<brief_summary>This randomize , partially-blinded , placebo moxifloxacin-controlled , single dose , 4-period , balance crossover study . The primary objective study separately assess effect therapeutic supratherapeutic dose GSK1322322 cardiac conduction ( correct QT interval [ QTc ] ) compare placebo eligible healthy male female subject . Avelox ( moxifloxacin hydrochloride ) use open-label positive control order validate sensitivity study detect QTc change . Approximately 56 healthy subject participate study approximately 9 week i.e . 30 day Screening period , 4-week Treatment period , 7-10 day Follow-up period . There 4 treatment period separate least 1 week . Subjects admit clinical unit Day -1 dose period . Each subject receive four treatment sequence ( GSK1322322 1200 milligram [ mg ] intravenous [ IV ] 60 minute x 1 dose , GSK1322322 3000 mg IV 60 minute x 1 dose , GSK1322322 Placebo IV 60 minute x 1 dose , moxifloxacin 400 mg administer orally x 1 dose ) Day 1 Treatment period randomize fashion . Twelve-lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , continuous Holter monitoring , laboratory test , vital sign measurement , serial pharmacokinetic sample collect 24 hour follow treatment . If clinically significant abnormality note , subject discharge clinical research unit completion assessment Day 2 period return approximately one week later next dosing period . Each individual subject follow dosing schedule every period . A Follow-up visit conduct 7-10 day administration last dose study medication treatment period 4 .</brief_summary>
