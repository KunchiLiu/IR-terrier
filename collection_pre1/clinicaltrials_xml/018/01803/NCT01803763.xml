	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate pathophysiological mechanism omalizumab patient document chronic urticaria complaint standard antihistamine treatment . With study investigator assess correlation Fc-IgE receptor downregulation well functionality clinical response omalizumab treatment patient chronic urticaria . This may approach disease well , Fc-IgE receptor crosslinking essential . The treatment time set total 4 monthly application omalizumab .

	<brief_title>Prospective Double-blind Placebo-controlled Study Effect Xolair ( Omalizumab ) Chronic Urticaria Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Chronic urticaria ( CU ) frequent disease lifetime incidence 25-30 % population . Currently , CU treatment relies mainly second generation antihistamine purely symptomatic . The disease tend cyclical nature spontaneous disappearance frequent relapse . Some patient show sufficient response standard second generation antihistamine like ( levo ) cetirizine 10mg , ( de ) loratadine 5mg terfenadine 120-180mg . Others need high dos ( 4-fold usual daily dose ) , often accompany sedation . Treatment may last month , even year . If first-line therapy insufficient , next step ( sometimes even use excessively high dos antihistamine ) add first generation , even sedate antihistamine , additional mode action ( e.g . anticholinergic effect doxepin treatment ) . A considerable number patient CU need treatment escalation leukotriene receptor block agent ( e.g . montelukast ) , systemic corticosteroid ( 5-20mg prednisolon/d ) even cyclosporine ( daily dose 3-5 mg/kg ) immunosuppressive drug use off-label . Such patient often investigated detail find infection autoimmune disease - often still without clear result . Different clinical finding suggest mast cell system many patient CU `` overactive '' increase releasability . Minor stress like scratch already induce degranulation result wheal-and-flare skin reaction . Therefore , therapy directly aim decrease mast cell `` hyperreleasability '' would optimal . Omalizumab bind selectively free IgE plasma , inhibit bind Fc-IgE receptor surface mast cell basophils reduces number Fc-IgE receptor basophil atopic patient . Significant reduction Fc-IgE receptor density surface circulate basophil find early 1 week administration omalizumab . In contrast , onset clinical efficacy omalizumab asthma consider take place relatively late , namely 4 month start treatment . The pathophysiologic concept omalizumab treatment allergic asthma focus neutralisation IgE , less Fc-IgE receptor density . In allergology , free IgE plasma relevant regard Fc-IgE receptor density effector cell . Therefore , Fc-IgE receptor density measurement might important parameter mast cell basophil `` releasability '' therefore good vitro surrogate marker reactivity . E.g . well know 50 % IgE-sensitized individual show clinically relevant allergic symptom . This difference sensitization allergy may also due Fc-IgE receptor density mast cell basophil . Flowcytometric determination Fc-IgE receptor density surface basophils additional test functional consequence change density ( ability crosslink Fc-IgE receptor autoantibody allergen ) raise possibility evaluate hypothesis - use omalizumab drug able decrease Fc-IgE receptor density : 1 . Study data show fix dose 300 mg omalizumab useful treatment CU . The investigator assume effect due decrease Fc-IgE receptor density . Thus , basophil Fc-IgE receptor density monitor quantitatively functionally ( see ) correlate clinical response . 2 . 30-40 % patient CU autoantibodies Fc-IgE receptor IgE , measure vitro ( already via ELISA , flowcytometric via CD63 CD203c upregulation basophil ) . Decrease Fc-IgE receptor density may decrease basophil reactivity explain correlated clinical response CU patient . At least three patient follow reactivity autoantibody study period . 3 . Some patient CU may also accompany IgE-mediated allergy , probably irrelevant CU , offer possibility functional test basophil responsiveness low concentration allergens - ( presumably high Fc-IgE receptor density ) omalizumab treatment ( low Fc-IgE rec . density ) . At least three patient follow allergen reactivity basophil . Objective Primary objective − Measurement kinetic Fc-IgE receptor density change basophils patient chronic urticaria omalizumab compare placebo Secondary objective - Change responsiveness Fc-IgE cross-linking dependent stimulus : - incubation patient 's basophil anti-IgE - allergen induce cross-linking ( grass pollen birch pollen allergic patient ) - comparison serum third party basophil - Measurement IL-3 hyperresponsiveness basophil Stimulation anti-IgE allergen - Daily urticaria activity score - Medication rescue medication use - German version Chronic Urticaria Quality Life Questionnaire ( CU-Q2oL ) Methods This monocentric , double-blind , randomized placebo-controlled trial , aim investigate pathophysiological mechanism omalizumab patient document chronic urticaria complaint standard antihistamine treatment . According inclusion criterion , 30 patient diagnose chronic urticaria recruit outpatient clinic . Omalizumab ( Xolair® ) administer fix dose 300 mg total 4 monthly dos accord reference . A follow-up visit plan 2 month last injection .</detailed_description>
