	<brief_summary>Background Localised muscle invasive bladder cancer ( MIBC ) life-threatening cause significant symptom . Around 50 % patient MIBC refer radiotherapy unfit standard radical treatment ( surgery daily radiotherapy chemotherapy ) , would normal life expectancy cancer adequately control . Retrospective study suggest radiotherapy give weekly use few fraction higher dos ( hypofractionated ) , may alternative daily radiotherapy option . Radiotherapy treatment plan base information CT scan show position shape bladder . This plan need take account fact bladder 's shape position change , depend full relation bowel . A safety margin therefore add around bladder plan treatment , reduce risk miss bladder radiotherapy . It possible take scan bladder 's position treatment adjust position treatment plan accordingly ensure bladder fully cover . In study also look whether possible design series treatment plan different size safety margin choose one fit best particular day . This call 'adaptive radiotherapy ' . This technique may enable accurate treatment delivery use small safety margin might help reduce side effect . Aims In patient MIBC suitable cystectomy daily radiotherapy aim ass : 1. whether treatment use adaptive planning successfully deliver multiple site across UK result acceptable level toxicity 2. local tumour control rate achieve hypofractionated weekly radiotherapy 3. requirement treat adaptive planning . How result use Results provide robust evidence use hypofractionated radiotherapy ass whether plausible worthwhile treatment patient population . The randomised element trial support implementation image-guided adaptive radiotherapy bladder cancer UK . HYBRID provide evidence benefit otherwise methodology inform development trial patient group .</brief_summary>
