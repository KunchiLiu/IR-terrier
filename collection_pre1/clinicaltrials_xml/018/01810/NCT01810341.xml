	<brief_summary>This study prospectively enroll approximately 880 child , least 18 month le 60 month age , refer pediatric developmental evaluation center . Enrolled child blood drawn RNA gene expression analysis optionally metabolite , lipid DNA analysis undergo clinical evaluation determine presence absence diagnosis ASD . The primary objective study : - To develop algorithm classify blood RNA gene expression pattern maximize agreement classification clinical assessment presence absence Autism Spectrum Disorders ( ASD ) . The secondary objective study : - To develop algorithm classify plasma metabolite and/or lipid profile way maximize agreement classification clinical assessment presence absence ASD . - To prospectively assess clinical sensitivity specificity plasma metabolite and/or lipid profile classification algorithm separate population consist child refer developmental evaluation clinic possible developmental disorder ( DD ) . - To evaluate clinical sensitivity specificity various combination gene expression signature , metabolite and/or lipid signature , presence ASD-associated genetic variation detect chromosomal microarray analysis ( CMA ) sequence protein-coding region genome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SynapDx Autism Gene Expression Analysis Study ( STORY )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary aim study define gene expression signature indicative ASD establish clinical sensitivity specificity . Clinician diagnosis ASD make use DSM-5 reference standard instrument . The widely use diagnostic instrument Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule ( ADOS-2 ) typical component clinical assessment child diagnose ASD evaluation perform study participant . Secondary aim study ( 1 ) define metabolite lipid signature indicative ASD establish clinical sensitivity specificity ( 2 ) determine clinical sensitivity specificity various combination gene expression signature , metabolite and/or lipid signature , presence ASD-associated genetic variation detect CMA sequence protein-coding region genome Analyses : Details analysis specify Statistical Analysis Plan ( SAP ) , include procedure handle outlier , miss data , difference across site . The SAP review approved committee Principal Investigators ( PIs ) unblinding validation set . Primary analysis : The primary outcome study estimate clinical sensitivity specificity SDX-002 test classify subject accord DSM-5 ASD diagnosis , associate 95 % confidence interval . Sensitivity specificity assess Validation Phase population base agreement clinical diagnosis presence absence Autism Spectrum Disorder DSM-5 ( publish May 2013 ) . The gene expression signature train 500 subject Development Phase set , use 5-fold cross validation result several machine learn algorithm , include partial least square , support vector machine , boost decision tree . The training procedure generate estimate ROC curve method , well confidence interval area curve ( AUC ) . The final choice machine-learning algorithm base AUC , well estimate performance chosen operate point ROC curve . The operating point choose provide high sensitivity acceptable specificity . Secondary analysis : In majority patient enrol date , consent obtain collection optional bio-repository sample . The intended analysis bio-repository sample establish ( see also , secondary objective list ) . The metabolomic lipomic signature similarly assess subset 500 subject Development Phase set consent bio-repository sample . In addition gene expression signature , metabolite and/or lipid signature DNA analysis combine gene expression signature various configuration impact additional measure clinical sensitivity specificity evaluate . If additional metabolomic/lipomic signature and/or DNA analysis improve test performance , element may include SDX-002 assay . Sensitivity specificity final SDX-002 assay also assess among subpopulation use demographic information result developmental test . There likely subject many subpopulation caution use interpreting result . Planned subpopulation analysis include gender , age , ethnicity , ASD DSM-IV-TR diagnostic subcategory , DSM-5 ASD severity level ( social communication restrict interests/repetitive behavior ) ADOS-2 score .</detailed_description>
