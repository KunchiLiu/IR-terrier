	<brief_summary>Surgical site infection common cause major morbidity . They also common obese woman . Cesarean section common surgery perform United States , therefore pregnant woman face problem frequently . There evidence show prophylactically administer antibiotic , cefazolin specifically , obese woman prior cesarean section reach adequate concentration adipose tissue prevent infection . The purpose study evaluate increase dose cefazolin attain adequate tissue concentration obese woman . Our hypothesis three gram cefazolin give 60 minute prior start cesarean section obese ( Body mass index ( BMI ) great equal 30 ) woman attain adequate adipose tissue concentration compare two gram cefazolin . Subjects select great 37 week gestation wiht singleton pregnancy require cesarean section obstetrical indication . Women exclude suspected infection , multiple gestation , preexist diabetes hypertension end organ damage . The subject screen OR schedule well clinic . They consent enrol primary investigator . Once enrolled subject randomize receive either two gram three gram cefazolin prophylactic antibiotic give 60 minute prior start surgery . Two adipose tissue sample obtain time surgery . The first start skin incision second end prior closure skin . There also separate IV place start procedure three blood draw collect . These three sample obtain start surgery antibiotic administration , time first adipose collection , time second adipose collection . The sample store -80 degree ship David P. Nicolau 's lab Hartford , CT tissue serum analysis . While subject hospital recover surgery , chart review perform determine infection occur post-operatively .
