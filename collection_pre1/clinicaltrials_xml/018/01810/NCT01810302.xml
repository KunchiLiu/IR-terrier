	<brief_title>Safety Study Nicardipine Treat Cerebral Vasospasm</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subarachnoid hemorrhage account approximately 5 % stroke affect 30,000 Americans per year . Poor outcome aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) occur 50 75 % patient , attribute secondary ischemia approximately 30 % patient . This delayed cerebral ischemia attribute anatomic narrowing artery cerebral vasculature occur follow SAH . Because relationship cerebral vasospasm , cerebral ischemia , poor outcome , significant effort establish treatment decrease incidence vasospasm SAH . Currently , medication hemodynamic maneuver use standard care treatment vasospasm improve outcome SAH . The calcium channel blocker , nimodipine , one treatment vasospasm show proven benefit . Nicardipine another calcium channel blocker evaluate several study via intravenous administration route . These study show significant improvement symptomatic angiographic vasospasm , although benefit outcome see . However , intravenous administration nicardipine associate significant systemic side effect may affect outcome include hypotension , pulmonary edema , azotemia . The administration nicardipine via intrathecal route avoids systemic complication associate intravenous dose since direct cerebrospinal fluid dose much low . The result systemic concentration remain low avoid systemic side effect , central nervous system concentration remain high . We propose difference may improve outcome minimize complication related effect patient outcome .</detailed_description>
