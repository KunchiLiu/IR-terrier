	<brief_title>Evaluation Effects Different Prostate Surgeries Urinary Sexual Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Benign prostatic hyperplasia ( BPH ) , one common diseases age men , associate bothersome lower urinary tract symptom ( LUTS ) affect quality life . The prevalence histopathologic BPH age dependent , initial development usually 40 year age . Similar histologic evidence , prevalence bothersome symptom also increase age . Approximately half men histologic diagnosis moderate severe LUTS . The common disorder associate BPH sexual dysfunction base purely age . Sexual dysfunction encompasses erectile dysfunction ( ED ) , also ejaculation abnormality , difficulty reach orgasm , decrease libido overall dissatisfaction . Many study suggest presence LUTS risk factor sexual dysfunction . Increasing life expectancy associate improvement health quality life elderly , many study examine sexuality group subject report interest sex persist . By review literature , effect different modality treat BPH , include medical , open surgical , endourological procedure , urinary function extensively discuss less extent sexual function . A significant problem arise discuss sexual function patient partner , review literature , know aspect male sexual function refer . Transurethral resection prostate ( TURP ) still consider gold standard treat BPH . However , author accept impairment sexual function secondary procedure . The exact magnitude problem difficult ass review publish literature . Most large series report ED rate 10 15 % . ( 11 &amp; 12 ) The etiology ED secondary TURP poorly understood . Most likely secondary electrical trauma cavernous nerve close prostate apex 5 7 ` clock position . Furthermore , thrombosis cavernosal artery may result mechanical trauma thermal damage . Post TURP ejaculatory dysfunction report documented form retrograde ejaculation 25-99 % . The mechanism destruction bladder neck mechanism responsible sympathetic mediate occlusion bladder neck ejaculation end forward expulsion ejaculate . Since introduction TURP effective tool treatment BPH , many endo-urologic technique try overcome limitation drawback gold standard procedure mainly cause perioperative bleeding require transfusion re-intervention , irrigation fluid absorption ( TUR syndrome ) need hospital stay . Currently holmium laser enucleation prostate ( HoLEP ) seem attractive alternative standard TURP . The efficacy safety HoLEP demonstrate even case large prostate otherwise would usually require open prostatectomy . In several comparative randomize study , HoLEP find superior TURP term catheter time , hospital stay , weight remove tissue , blood loss longer operative time . However , impact male sexual function well establish . The successful outcome relief LUTs postulate favor improve overall sexual function . However , factor include laser heating effect , hypothesize contribute postoperative erectile dysfunction . The safety bipolar TURP enhance use normal saline eliminate incidence metabolite toxicity dilutional hyponatremia physic electrical current return theoretically reduce thermal tissue damage site surgery distant site faulty patient grounding ( patient return electrode pad ) . Urologists observe well intra-operative visibility bipolar resection , may also enhance resident education . The deep coagulation effect bipolar resection think contribute postoperative sexual dysfunction . However , sexual function bipolar TURP still well establish literature . To best investigator ' knowledge prospective study literature compare three widely available procedure monopolar TURP , bipolar TURP HoLEP term urinary , erectile ejaculatory outcome .</detailed_description>
