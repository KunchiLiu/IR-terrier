	<brief_summary>The treatment common cancer ( colon , breast , lung , liver kidney ) recently add new therapeutic class know `` anti-angiogenic '' . It bear well understanding tumor growth require development neo-vessels . These new vessel major importance viability tumor also birth metastasis . This neo-angiogenesis complex result imbalance pro-angiogenic factor anti-angiogenic factor . Growth factor VEGF receptor ( VEGFR-1 , VEGFR-2 VEGFR-3 ) way survival endothelial cell require tumor neoangiogenesis . The anti-angiogenic drug currently available market bevacizumab ( Avastin ® ) , sunitinib ( Sutent ® ) sorafenib ( Nexavar ® ) . The mechanism anti-angiogenic action three main drug pharmacological inhibition VEGF pathway . These new anti-angiogenic therapy , however , significant adverse effect common serious rare . Hypertension common side effect observe patient treated anti-VEGF . This usually iatrogenic hypertension control antihypertensive therapy rarely compromise pursuit anti-angiogenic therapy . More rarely , serious consequence malignant hypertension , severe hypertension refractory reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy associate severe hypertension also report . The pathophysiology hypertension may due neutralization major physiological effect VEGF endothelial cell therefore vascular wall . The study microcirculation useful diagnosis microvascular also macrovascular disease evaluation chronic arterial venous severe determines prognosis . In indication , capillaroscopy remain gold standard work pathophysiological visualization phenomenon measure avoids artifact difficulty interpretation . It appeal additional technology directly measure capillary pressure , capillary flow velocity , indirectly assess capillary permeability function lymphatic canaliculus . The simple technological input : video microscopy digital image analysis , also improve practice routine clinical capillaroscopy main field application , evaluation microangiopathy connective . The examination perform quickly easily archive quantify . Only two study 14 16 patient able see decrease capillary density correlate therapeutic activity anti-angiogenic tumor mass metastasis . Thus , propose quantify number relatively large patient patient decrease capillary density well relationship decrease number capillary anti-tumor response . The study also aim measure prevalence hypertension patient treat bevacizumab establish link data modification capillary microcirculation .</brief_summary>
