	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn treat patient severe injury relate trauma prevent failure vital organ patient population . Approximately 200 severely injured patient blunt trauma 40 healthy volunteer subject enrol study . During study seven blood sample ( 4-5 ml ) collect patient suffer severe trauma 28 day period . A one time 5 ml blood sample collect healthy volunteer . Clinical data collect daily patient hospitalize . The initial blood sample must collect qualify patient within first 12 hour admission hospital . The reason blood sample validate rapid genomic test real time . Once confirm , genomic test use identify patient complicate clinical course would , therefore , good candidate interventional , immunomodulatory therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim : To prospectively validate rapid genomic test obtain blood leukocyte subpopulation severely traumatize patient first 24 hour admission , use discriminate patient complicate clinical trajectory would , therefore , good candidate interventional , immunomodulatory therapy . Following severe blunt traumatic injury recovery , alteration leukocyte transcriptome occur . Thus , propose leukocyte transcriptome signal base expression validate 63 total leukocyte 181 PMN gene use identify patient risk complicate clinical outcome , either alone combined anatomical physiological predictor . The goal clinical trial validate predictive ability transcriptome‐based prognostic . This non‐interventional , observational study 200 severely injured patient blunt trauma 40 healthy volunteer . The entry criterion use past eight year Glue Grant . Severe blunt injure patient meet inclusion criterion undergo rapid leukocyte genomic screen admission follow morning ( ~24 hr ) . Additional blood sample collect 4 , 7 , 14 , 21 28 day , long patient trauma surgical intensive care unit , banking . Over four year period , enter 240 subject University Florida University Washington Harborview Medical Center . In trauma subject , blood sample collect admission , day 1 , 4 , 7 , 14 , 21 28 , discharge ICU death . A total 4 5 mLs blood collect time point . In healthy volunteer , one-time blood sample collect . Screening Consent : Trauma patient identify study personnel follow presentation emergency room . The subject legal next-of-kin approach consent within 96 hour patient meet entry criterion . We ask delayed consent patient population 96 hour due severity injury , vulnerable nature patient early time , challenge reach patient 's legal representative . Should inform consent obtain within 96 hour , blood sample data collect discarded . Healthy volunteer subject identify general population way advertisement flyer post respective university . The flyer provide contact information laboratory . Healthy subject screen via inclusion/exclusion criterion upon contact . If appropriate participation , subject consult consent . Blood collect exist access , venipuncture , require . Blood promptly place ice transfer laboratory process cell lysates plasma . All relevant clinical data hemodynamic measurement collect daily patient hospitalize . - Demographic information . - Past present medical record - Laboratory , microbiology , test result - X-ray , CT , MRI , US image test result - Records medication receive admission - Records physical exam admission - Records vital sign hemodynamic monitoring admission - Records procedure intervention admission - Records procedure intervention hospital admission - Condition discharge discharge facility Each two clinical site maintain responsibility collection storage clinical data . REDCap ( Research Electronic Data Capture ) use collection clinical data . It secure , Web-based application design support traditional case report form data capture . Cell lysates obtain University Washington‐Harborview Medical Center ship University Florida genomic analysis , plasma sample collect Shands Hospital University Florida ship University Washington cytokine analyse Luminex™ . At yearly interval , electronic data transfer University Florida University Washington non-identifiable , coded clinical data cytokine genomic data occur . Blood draw relate study do bedside manner compatible standard clinical care laboratories healthy volunteer . Tubes use blood draw relate study label unique study number carry patient identifier . The key link unique patient number patient personal identifier store password protect encrypt file accessible PI research team . All patient collect clinical data store cabinet locate office PI research team . The computer use storage data locate office PI research staff always lock . The computer password protect encrypted . We base assessment number subject preliminary data set 1637 severe trauma subject . In study , 1637 subject , 31 % 507 patient time recovery less five day , could identify uncomplicated outcome . In contrast , 442 patient 27 % complicate outcome , define either late death MOF lasting longer 14 day . Assuming similar frequency complicate uncomplicated patient 200 subject , would expect 62 subject discharge within 5 day without organ injury , 54 subject prolong organ failure and/or late death . These number well within range require statistical validation different model . We anticipate overall consent rate observational study minimal risk 75 % meaning achieve accrual rate 25 trauma subject per year institution , 34 subject per year meeting entry criterion . We expect difficulty accrue 200 subject four year period participate site . They Level 1 trauma center excess capacity complete propose study . In protocol , study specific intervention collection blood . The risk draw blood vein include discomfort site puncture ; possible bruising swell around puncture site ; rarely infection ; , uncommonly , faintness procedure . Invasion privacy negate use cod data specimen collect . There direct benefit study subject participation . This research may benefit society future . This study may one day result new test treatment , may help prevent cure disease . No conflict interest exist PI sub-investigator .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Trauma Patients : All adult ( age ≥18 ) Blunt trauma patient hemorrhagic shock , define either systolic BP ( SBP ) &lt; 90 mm Hg base deficit ( BD ) &lt; 6 meq Ability obtain Informed Consent within 96 hour injury . Ability obtain first lab draw within 12 hour presentation Emergency Department . Exclusion Criteria Trauma Patients : Patients expect survive great 48 hour . Patients severe head injury . Severe preexist organ dysfunction Those unable obtain first blood sample within 12 hour injury Subjects receive oncolytics within 14 day Subjects HIV + CD4 count &lt; 200/mm3 Subjects expect survive 28 day due preexisting , uncorrectable medical condition Total body surface burn &gt; 40 % Prisoners Current , chronic steroid use If uncertain patient 's past medical history time enrollment , enrol study subsequently remove fail meet criterion . This do many circumstance patient population due severity injury , vulnerable nature patient early time , challenge reach patient 's legal representative unaware past medical history . The purpose exclusion ensure adequate allocation resource . Specifically , goal evaluate patient high risk Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome ( MODS ) . Those anticipated early death add little achieve objective . Severe head injury exclude well since mortality subject usually attributable head injury rather severe organ dysfunction . In addition , steroid use know affect immunologic response injury . Inclusion Criteria Healthy Volunteers : 1. adult ( age ≥18 ) 2 . Ability obtain Informed Consent prior blood collection . Exclusion Criteria Healthy Volunteers : 1 . Severe preexist organ dysfunction 2 . Subjects receive oncolytics within 14 day 3 . Subjects HIV + CD4 count &lt; 200/mm3 4 . Subjects expect survive 28 day due preexisting , uncorrectable medical condition 5 . Total body surface burn &gt; 40 % 6 . Prisoners 7 . Current , chronic steroid use</criteria>
