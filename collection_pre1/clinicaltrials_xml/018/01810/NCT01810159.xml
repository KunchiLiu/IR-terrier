The investigator propose evaluate effectiveness two strategy increase use evidence-based treatment OAUD within primary care : integrate collaborative care ( ICC ) education resource ( E &amp; R ) . While strategy provide primary care practice clinical information , ICC address barrier include organizational technical support deliver evidence-based care . ICC ground chronic care model include behavioral health provider work part care team . Essential element ICC strategy include decision support component help provider complex patient , restructure delivery clinical information system support delivery evidence-based care . Our approach implement ICC base organizational transformation model quality improvement . The investigator define E &amp; R strategy provide print educational material access resource along provider education . Both strategy design increase delivery two evidence-based practice : motivational enhancement therapy medication assist therapy . The investigator propose 5-year mixed method study conduct RCT , randomization occur level care team patient . The investigator partner 5 Venice Family Clinic ( VFC ) clinic , two hospital LA County , COPE Health Solutions . VFC large federally qualified health center ( FQHC ) large free clinic United States . Our approach include document review , focus group , interview , survey obtain data adoption process implementation outcomes ; analysis patient record patient survey service system patient outcomes ; analysis provider financial record patient record survey estimate cost . The investigator enroll 400 patient OAUD diagnosis follow 3 12 month . Our specific aim : 1 ) To measure process extent ICC E &amp; R implementation ; 2 ) To test effectiveness ICC compare E &amp; R strategy promote A . Implementation outcomes B . Service system outcomes C. Patient outcomes ; 3 ) To estimate provider cost strategy . The investigator define implementation outcome measure acceptability , adoption , appropriateness , feasibility , sustainability evidence-based OAUD treatment . The investigator define service system outcomes 1 ) process measure treatment quality 2 ) treatment co-morbidities . The investigator define patient outcome hospital readmission , OAUD outcomes , patient functioning , negative consequence substance use , unmet need . The investigator define cost outcome start-up cost , operate cost medical/psychiatric cost offset .</detailed_description>
