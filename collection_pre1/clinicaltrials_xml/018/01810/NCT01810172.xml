	<brief_summary>Often decision chest tube removal trial chest tube clamp base subjective assessment . This lead delay chest tube removal . Recently , monitor record air leak do use digital pleural drainage device . This provide u objective continuous record air leak well change pleural pressure . Our hypothesis use ATMOS digital pleural drainage system result short hospital stay comparison traditional pleural drainage system .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Digital Air Leak Monitoring Patients Undergoing Lung Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Technology become driving force surgery . From robotics digital monitoring oxygen saturation , revolutionize way care patient . However , new technology come cost healthcare system . It therefore important ensure new device actually improve outcome . One example minimally invasive surgery , decrease morbidity patient reduce length hospital stay . Unfortunately , despite advance lung surgery , delay discharge hospital still prevalent due prolong air leak . Many intra-operative method explore order limit issue underwhelming success . This propose randomize control trial compare digital pleural collection system ATMOS traditional pleural collection device Atrium . Our research question : Can use digital air leak monitoring system decrease hospital stay patient undergo anatomical lung resection compare traditional pleural drainage system ?</detailed_description>
