	<brief_summary>Research Questions : 1 . Does use dabigatran bridge result consistent therapeutic anticoagulation ? What percentage patient become subtherapeutic warfarin dabigatran stop ? 2 . What incidence bleed event use dabigatran overlap warfarin bridging ? 3 . What cost benefit use dabigatran instead dalteparin bridge anticoagulation ?</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Validation Novel Dabigatran Based Peri-Operative Bridging Anticoagulation Protocol Patients Chronic Warfarin Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subject Selection : The study population include low risk patient long-term warfarin therapy venous thromboembolic disease ( VTE ) follow hematology anticoagulation clinic . Low risk define status great 12 month post thromboembolic event . The inclusion criterion include : ( 1 ) Low risk status define , ( 2 ) Chronic warfarin therapy least 12 month duration target INR 2.0-3.0 . Patients exclude study one follow met : ( 1 ) increase risk bleeding : bleeding require transfusion last 12 month , history hemorrhagic stroke intracranial hemorrhage , recent gastrointestinal bleeding { &lt; 6 month } , history bleed disorder , ( 2 ) Pregnant , breastfeed plan become pregnant breastfeed , ( 3 ) inhibitor allergy/sensitivity dabigatran etexilate , ( 4 ) Creatinine Clearance &lt; 30 mls/min , ( 5 ) Concomitant treatment strong P-glycoprotein ( 6 ) Known thrombophilia include Factor V Leiden mutation , prothrombin gene mutation , antithrombin deficiency , protein C deficiency , protein S deficiency , antiphospholipid antibody syndrome , ( 7 ) inability provide write informed consent . Research Plan : Patients identify perform manual search anticoagulation clinic database identify patient long-term warfarin therapy ( &gt; 12 month ) . The result glean identify patient meet inclusion criterion list . Patients contact via phone one anticoagulation clinic personnel know patient familiar history . If patient interested participate study ask come assessment elucidate whether meet inclusion criterion describe . The coordinator discus study principle , goal , risk . If interested study inform consent obtain study coordinator , If interested participate study exclude . All patient enrol study undergo plan sham surgery bridge protocol . This take place patient 2 week period , study period On day -5 , patient stop take warfarin . They baseline CBC , INR , activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) , thrombin time ( TT ) drawn . They INR , aPTT TT draw daily duration study period , except sham surgery day follow day , Day +5 post sham surgery day longer INR = 2 . If INR = 2 Day -2 stop warfarin , Vitamin K adminstered orally help reverse INR normal . When INR fall &lt; 2.0 , dabigatran start therapeutic dose 150 mg orally twice daily . This continue sham surgery day , . On even sham surgery day , warfarin restart twice patient 's maintenance dose maximum 10 mg orally . Dabigatran decrease prophylactic dose 150 mg orally daily . Warfarin dose adjust patient base day +2 INR . Dabigatran prophylaxis continue INR great equal 2.0 , point discontinue warfarin maintain . The INR check day dabigatran discontinue . Basic demographic information collect study participant include age sex . Patient 's weight , medical history , current medication , indication long-term warfarin therapy record . Safety Reporting The study closely follow laboratory test relates coagulation status ( INR , pTT , PTT , CBC ) . All serious adverse event capture appropriately assess Principal Investigator causality expectedness . An adverse drug reaction noxious unintended response study drug cause administration drug . Lack efficacy consider adverse drug reaction . Untoward medical occurrence consider adverse drug reaction causal relationship event study drug rule . An adverse event consider `` serious '' meet follow criterion : - Results death , - Is life-threatening , - Requires in-patient hospitalization prolongation exist hospitalization , - Results persistent significant disability / incapacity , - Is congenital anomaly / birth defect , - Is important medical event may immediately life-threatening result death hospitalization may jeopardize patient may require intervention prevent one outcomes listed definition . Should serious unexpected adverse drug reaction occur , report Health Canada accordance Regulations Amending Food &amp; Drug Regulations ( 1024 - Clinical Trials ) , Section C.05.014 . - Where neither fatal life-threatening , within 15 day become aware information - Where fatal life-threatening , immediately possible , event , within 7 day become aware information , - Within 8 day inform Health Canada ADR , submit complete report possible include assessment importance implication finding . All serious unexpected adverse drug reaction ( safety event applicable ) report Capital Health Research Ethics Board . Analysis data : To address primary objective , investigator look percentage patient cohort 40 normal INR , day 0 ( sham surgery day ) thus would ready proceed surgial intervention . Simple statistic use calculate percentage . For patient correct INR day 0 , thus would surgery delayed , multivariate analysis elucidate factor contribute insufficient normalization bleeding test perform . Perioperative bridge anticoagulation dabigatran warfarin study previously , investigator know significance overlap INR . It possible patient under-anticoagulated post-operative period . An exploratory analysis perform see case . Lastly , cost analysis perform compare dabigatran base bridge protocol current standard care , dalteparin base bridge protocol . Confidentiality : Patient information maintain paper copy office Dr. Sudeep Shivakumar lock cabinet . Only member study team access information . For purpose data-analysis , information enter database within CDHA firewall password protect . Patients give study identification number therefore identifiable information keep database . The study team keep list screen enrolled patient correspond study identification number . Once data analysis complete information store Capital Health Centre Clinical Research Research Archive Room offsite storage facility lease Capital Health ( Iron Mountain , Hammonds Plains ) 25 year per ICH-GCP Guidelines . Drs . Shivakumar , McCurdy , Sharif , Anderson , Shawwa bound physician-patient confidentiality . Harms : There theoretical risk bleeding study , although exceedingly low . There theoretical risk bleed restart warfarin prophylactic dabigatran . Bleeding laboratory parameter follow daily , except day Sham surgery day 1 , allow u detect abnormality coagulation test . Lastly , risk allergy/sensitivity Dabigatran . Benefits : There three main benefit study : 1 . Dabigatran offer oral alternative subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin . Subcutaneous injection painful intimidate many patient . An oral alternative painless easy administer . 2 . An increase number patient manage dabigatran outside context clinical trial . No prior study evaluate dabigatran peri-operative set specifically re-institution warfarin . 3 . LMWH regimens costly . Using protocol outline , average cost per bridge LMWH regimen $ 225.00 CDN whereas Dabigatran $ 18.00 CDN , save $ 207.00 CDN per patient .</detailed_description>
