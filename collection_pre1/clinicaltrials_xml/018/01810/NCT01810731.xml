	<detailed_description>Recent investment influenza surveillance many African country confirm result country young child , pregnant woman , chronic medical condition increase risk hospitalization death influenza infection . Annual influenza vaccination effective method prevent influenza virus infection complication . Vaccination currently recommend high risk group many developed country WHO Strategic Advisory Group Experts ( SAGE ) Immunization make recommendation vaccination pregnant woman 2005 position paper influenza vaccine . In 2012 , SAGE conclude pregnant woman important risk group inactivate seasonal influenza vaccination base upon `` compelling evidence substantial risk severe disease group evidence seasonal influenza vaccine safe effective prevent disease pregnant woman well young infant , disease burden also high '' . Maternal influenza immunization view effective way protect infant le 6 month age yet eligible immunization . In United States , child 6 month experience high rate influenza-associated hospitalization among risk severe outcomes . Recent data Kenya , similarly suggest rate influenza-associated hospitalization child age 1 high , high , observed United States . Vaccination pregnant woman provide protection infant laboratory-confirmed influenza illness first month life . Furthermore , vaccination pregnant woman associate decreased risk pre-term birth small gestational age Canada state Georgia US , increase birth weight infant period high transmission Bangladesh . However , traditional TIV may reduce immunogenicity HIV-infected adult , HIV infection show reduce placental transfer tetanus measles antibody . The high prevalence disease , include malaria malnutrition , may also impact effectiveness influenza vaccination pregnant woman infant sub-Saharan Africa . Use double dose QIV may produce great immune response pregnant woman increase antibody production may improve transplacental transfer influenza antibody develop fetus , confer good possibly longer duration protection influenza infection . Therefore , propose conduct randomize control trial influenza vaccine high HIV-prevalence , malaria-endemic setting Kenya , use inactivated polio vaccine ( IPV ) comparator/control . We propose assess safety , immunogenicity , efficacy standard dose ( 15 µg ) QIV ( FLUARIX® ( GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals , Dresden , Germany ) double dose ( 30 µg ) QIV HIV-infected HIV-uninfected pregnant woman . OBJECTIVES : 1 . To evaluate immunogenicity standard dose ( 15 µg ) QIV double dose ( 30 µg ) QIV HIV-infected uninfected pregnant woman 2 . To evaluate level vaccine-induced influenza antibody transfer infants HIV-infected uninfected pregnant woman receive standard dose ( 15 µg ) QIV double dose ( 30 µg ) QIV 3 . To evaluate safety standard dose ( 15 µg ) QIV double dose ( 30 µg ) QIV HIV-infected HIV-uninfected pregnant woman fetus DESIGN : This trial conduct double-blind , randomize , control trial stratify HIV status 720 pregnant woman second third trimester infant reside health demographic surveillance site ( HDSS ) around Siaya District Hospital Lwak Mission Hospital Nyanza Province , Western Kenya . The study conduct accordance International Conference Harmonization Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) standard . Mothers must agree counsel tested HIV time screen enrollment unless write documentation HIV infection negative HIV test last 3 month . After initial screen eligibility inform consent , enrol woman stratify HIV status ( infect , uninfected ) block randomize 1:1:1:1 ratio receive standard dose ( 15 µg ) QIV , double dose ( 30 µg ) QIV IPV . The day vaccination consider study Day 0 subject . Each subject receive single vaccination . For first 240 enrolled woman , study personnel visit home Days 1 , 2 , 3 active surveillance adverse event follow vaccination . Pregnancy outcomes record subject ( live birth , still birth , spontaneous abortion ) . HIV test repeat birth woman negative result screen . Live still bear infant examine trained study personnel first 24 hour delivery determine birth weight , length , assess gestational age , identify possible congenital anomaly associate vaccination . All enrolled subject ask return antenatal study clinic Study Day 7 , Day 28 , Day 56 ( deliver ) , delivery , febrile respiratory illness concern . During enrollment process , mobile telephone number record ( number record someone identify village mobile telephone willing transmit information ) . Participants contact phone person every 2 week determine fever and/or cough prior 2 week . Subjects fever receive malaria smear treatment appropriate per Kenya Ministry Health ( MOH ) guideline . Subjects fever cough respiratory specimen collect via placement NP/OP swab train clinical personnel influenza test . After delivery , subject ask bring infant study clinic evaluation Days 7 , 42 , 70 life child approximately 6 month age . Infants also surveillance fever , history fever , hypothermia and/or cough first 6 month life . All febrile , hypothermic , and/or cough infant receive test malaria nasopharyngeal ( NP ) oropharyngeal ( OP ) swab influenza . Febrile infants 2 month age receive additional testing treatment per national guideline . Any infant admit hospital respiratory symptom , hypothermia , apnea fever receive test influenza real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction ( rRT-PCR ) NP/OP specimens . Vaccine immunogenicity evaluate compare hemagglutination inhibition ( HI ) titer Day 0 Day 28 delivery mother , cord blood , mother infant infant Day 70 life , infant approximately 6 month age . We determine proportion vaccinate woman achieve fourfold rise HI titer post-vaccination compare pre-vaccination HI titer ≥40 subject baseline HI titer &lt; 10 , compare outcome control . The proportion HI titer ≥40 cord blood infant also measure compare among vaccine recipient control . Geometric mean HI titer also compare .</detailed_description>
