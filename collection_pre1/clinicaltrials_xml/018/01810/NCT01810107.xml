	<brief_summary>The specific aim study develop growth development chart ( similar height weight chart child ) identifies pattern development pediatric vocal cord lamina propria single three layer structure . A secondary aim identify whether growth chart show pattern linear development whether clear critical period development .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Efficacy Optical Imaging Evaluate Anatomy Developing Pediatric Vocal Fold</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study identify critical period development lamina propria structure pediatric vocal fold matures . A Universal Modular Glottiscope utilized adequate laryngeal exposure . An operating microscope use magnification . This setup allow Optical Coherence Tomography ( OCT ) image probe introduce use laryngoscope provide stability . The optical imaging probe direct , gently apply towards , glottal surface , image field 500 micron x 500 micron x 350 micron obtain . As probe move along medial superior mucosal surface vocal fold , `` real-time '' image obtain digitally store review . The digitally store image assess analyzed optical characteristic . The optical imaging probe withdrawn patient original operative procedure perform . Images attain `` non-contact '' mode ( probe tip remain space vocal fold ) `` contact '' mode ( probe tip gently place glottal tissue compress ) . The contact mode allow deep imaging ( much like ultrasound ) , would useful situation involve large ( thicker ) vocal fold . The study end image acquire range developmental age able refine optical characteristic optical imaging system . Adults also include study comparison OCT image adult may confirm number vocal fold layer compare child .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Children age 1 month 18 ( adult &gt; 18 ) undergo laryngoscopy bronchoscopy airway evaluation patient already schedule general anesthesia intravenous catheter placement part standard routine . Children ( adult ) undergo otolaryngology procedure indication airway obstruction risk abnormal vocal chord . For instance , child undergo adenoidectomy , sinus surgery tracheotomy good candidate study normal vocal chord development . Children whose parent give sign informed consent Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) Authorization sign assent form ( 7 old ) agree participate study . Eligibility determine Principal Investigator . Adults give sign informed consent HIPAA Authorization . Children ( adult ) form laryngeal anomaly pathology . Children previously intubate . Children , adolescent , adult smoke . Exclusion determine Principal Investigator .</criteria>
