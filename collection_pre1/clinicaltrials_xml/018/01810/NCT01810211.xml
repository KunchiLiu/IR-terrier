	<brief_summary>This study look , , active stretching procedure effective correcting posterior shoulder tightness ( PST ) post-operative population . Posterior shoulder tightness influence shoulder mobility function within symptomatic asymptomatic population . There previous study examine effectiveness different active stretching procedure ability correct PST asymptomatic population . As clinician helpful investigate effect within symptomatic population order prescribe appropriate effective stretch within individual 's home exercise program . The study design double blind randomize control trial . During evaluation passive measurement PST internal rotation perform . Another therapist , blind measurement , randomly select subgroup individual place first three individual sequence follow remainder participant . At time therapist instruct individual corresponding exercise perform front therapist . The individual perform exercise one time day twice follow day upon follow prior internal rotation PST measure . At point conclusion individual involvement study . Null Hypothesis1 : Stretches effective treatment reduce PST acutely post-operative shoulder population . Hypothesis1 : Stretches effective treatment reduce PST acutely post-operative population . Null Hypothesis2 : There significant difference reduction PST horizontal adduction stretch modify sleeper stretch acutely post-operative shoulder population . Hypothesis2 : There significant difference reduction PST horizontal adduction stretch modify sleeper stretch acutely post-operative shoulder population .</brief_summary>
