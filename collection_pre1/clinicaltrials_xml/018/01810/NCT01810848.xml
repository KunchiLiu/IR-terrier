	<brief_summary>Osteoarthritis knee degenerative joint disease involve degradation joint . Symptoms include joint tenderness , pain , stiffness , lock , occasionally effusion . Over 40 million Americans also cardiovascular disease addition OA . Initiation maintenance even low-levels physical activity critical management cardiac risk . Patients osteoarthritis show poorer aerobic conditioning , low daily physical activity level low self-efficacy exercise non-OA cohort . It establish exist consistent gradient across activity group indicate great longevity reduce risk CHD , CVD , stroke , active individual . Available research suggest great gain cardiovascular fitness occur move sedentary individual even low level physical activity , 12 week enough demonstrate change risk profile at-risk individual . Finally , appropriate level aerobic strength train show beneficial treatment osteoarthritis knee . This study evaluate effectiveness hylan G-F 20 ( single injection preparation ) promote great level physical activity fitness measure MET level compare exercise-only cohort ; evaluate change physical function well cardiovascular risk profile . This randomized , single-blinded clinical trial compare injection knee joint Hylan GF-20 sham procedure . Subjects undergo regular exercise program 6 month follow randomization .</brief_summary>
