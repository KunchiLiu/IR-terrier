	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II/III trial study well radiation therapy work give together cisplatin compare docetaxel cetuximab docetaxel surgery treat patient stage III-IV squamous cell head neck cancer . Specialized radiation therapy delivers high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor cell grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill transmit tumor kill molecule . It yet know whether radiation therapy effective give cisplatin , docetaxel , cetuximab docetaxel .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To select good experimental arm improve disease-free survival ( DFS ) control arm radiation cisplatin . ( Phase II ) II . To determine whether select experimental arm improve overall survival ( OS ) control arm radiation cisplatin . ( Phase III ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To improve local-regional disease control . II . To compare distant metastasis . III . To compare pattern cancer failure ( local , regional , distant ) correlate radiation dose technique . IV . To compare acute toxicity profile radiation therapy ( RT ) completion treatment . V. To compare late toxicity profile 1 , 3 , 5 year treatment . VI . To compare overall quality life . VII . To compare patient-reported outcome . VIII . To compare swallow function 1 2 year . IX . To investigate association acute mucosal toxicity , swallow function , quality life ( QOL ) . X . To compare quality adjust life year ( QALY ) . XI . To investigate association late toxicity ( dysphagia ) QALY . XII . To determine whether specific molecular profile associate clinical outcome . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment group . ARM 1 : Patients undergo intensity modulate radiation therapy ( IMRT ) daily ( QD ) five day week receive cisplatin intravenously ( IV ) 1-2 hour weekly 6 week . ARM 2 : Patients undergo IMRT Arm I receive docetaxel IV weekly 6 week . ARM 3 : Patients receive cetuximab IV 120 minute week 1 60 minute weekly week 2-7 . Patients undergo IMRT Arm I receive docetaxel weekly 6 week . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 3 month , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , annually thereafter .</detailed_description>
