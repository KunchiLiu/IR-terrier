	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether tactile stimulation reduce sensibility affected extremity stroke effect . Hypothesis : Stimulation sensibility stroke significant contribution improve sensibility . Without stimulation , signal sent brain need healthy part brain adapt function . Stimulation sensibility period time side body , give brain signal opportunity compare signal recognize . New connection able interpret signal correctly .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Through stroke rehabilitation , function damage area replace healthy part brain . It important rehabilitation take advantage compensatory quality whit early intervention mobilization . Only small gain lead big improvement . About half stroke survivor get reduced sensibility cause bye stroke , sensibility consider important part rehabilitation function activity . A Norwegian guideline conclude scientific knowledge week recommend kind treatment . There evidence improvement sensibility specific train stimulation give . Achievements sensibility lead improvement function . The project carry randomize control trial . In project , intervention group receive tactile sens stimulate twice daily period 3 month , control group receive standard treatment . The result group measure treatment .</detailed_description>
