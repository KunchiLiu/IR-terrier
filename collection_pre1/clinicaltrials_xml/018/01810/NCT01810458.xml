	<brief_summary>We hypothesize individual Alpha-1 Antitrypsin ( AAT ) deficiency ongoing liver injury detect usual blood test use look liver function . This ongoing liver injury lead cirrhosis significant number adult AAT deficiency .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Liver Fibrosis Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency ( AATD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Our overarch hypothesis liver disease adult AAT deficiency result accumulation abnormally fold protein within endoplasmic reticulum hepatocyte . In individual , intrinsic cellular mechanism hepatocyte sufficient clear adequate amount abnormally fold protein liver disease occur . In AAT deficient individual develop liver disease , environmental genetic factor stress hepatocyte , normal cellular mechanism maintain homeostasis disrupt , lead liver disease . For proposal , hypothesis prevalence liver disease adult AAT high previously report liver injury fibrosis accurately detect available routine liver test . Testing hypothesis require initial evaluation liver disease liver function test imaging , histologic confirmation liver biopsy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Alpha1 Antitrypsin deficiency confirm PI*ZZ genotype another identify rare allele ; Age range 1870 ; Willingness consent liver biopsy ; Ability travel UF necessary protocol ; Platelet count great equal 50,000/mm3 INR less equal 1.5 . Hemophilia , anticoagulant therapy interrupt briefly , malignancy , condition would compromise safety liver biopsy ; Any know preexist medical condition might interfere patient 's participation completion study condition , opinion investigator would make patient unsuitable enrollment ; Active substance abuse include , limited , alcohol , intravenous , inhaled drug ; History adverse reaction allergy local anesthetic , sedative , premedication use percutaneous liver biopsy ; Poor venous access make subject unable complete require laboratory testing schedule ; Females pregnant lactate time enrollment . Should female subject become pregnant follow period initial liver biopsy , continued participation would allow follow condition meet : subject desire continue ; discussion risk benefit participation principal investigator subject occur ; liver biopsy would perform follow period .</criteria>
