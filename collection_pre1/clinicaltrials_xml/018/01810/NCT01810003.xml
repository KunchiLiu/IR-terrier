	<brief_summary>Subclinical inflammation indisputably recognize key etiological factor development atherosclerosis subsequent cardiovascular disease . Obesity related dysmetabolic state include metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) highly prevalent cause subclinical inflammation . Obesity MetS diet lifestyle-related grow body literature suggest specific nutrient , long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( LCn-3PUFA ) , may attenuate pro-inflammatory state associate condition . However , careful review exist literature topic reveals important gap knowledge , purport anti-inflammatory effect LCn-3PUFA even question many . Significant confound attributable study design , sample size biomarker selection may responsible part inconsistency literature LCn-3PUFA inflammation . We also find evidence available date ( ) base primarily secondary analysis , study publish primarily design investigate inflammation primary outcome . It remain unclear whether different LCn-3PUFA , primarily docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA , 22:6n-3 ) eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA , 20:5n-3 ) , similar effect pro-inflammatory process almost study undertake use mix LCn-3PUFA . Whether efficacy EPA DHA influence sex/gender also unknown . Finally , good understand systemic tissue-specific mechanism underlie anticipated anti-inflammatory effect different LCn-3PUFA MetS would also great value . Addressing gap important public health implication , consider LCn-3PUFA supplement broadly indiscriminately recommended prevention cardiovascular disease . The overarch objective propose research compare anti-inflammatory effect EPA DHA men woman MetS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose study undertaken accord double-blind randomized placebo control cross-over design 3 treatment phase : 1- high DHA , 2- High EPA , 3- Control . Each treatment phase last 10 week separate 8-week washout . Participants randomize one 6 treatment sequence stratify sex . Treatments provide 3 identical 1g capsule per day . During 3 treatment period , subject receive random order 0g/d EPA+DHA ( 3g corn oil placebo ) , 3g/d EPA ( &gt; 90 % EPA ) , 3g/d DHA ( &gt; 90 % DHA ) . Long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid ( LCn-3PUFA ) provide re-esterified triacylglycerol form study show bioavailability great EPA DHA consume TG rather ethyl ester . The therapeutic dose maximize anti-inflammatory effect LCn-3PUFA patient inflammation establish , although data suggest may dose-dependent . However , study healthy human volunteer suggest intake &gt; 2 g EPA + DHA/day require affect inflammatory process . Many available study use dose EPA+DHA low 2g/d , apparent anti-inflammatory effect . A study show dose 1.8g/d EPA+DHA induce significant change peripheral blood cell ( PBC ) inflammation gene expression , change plasma CRP concentration . In present study , propose use dose 3 g/d individual LCn-3PUFA test , high end recommend intake patient high plasma TG , maximize chance observe change inflammatory marker differentiate effect EPA DHA , exist . Participants instruct maintain constant body weight course study . They also counsel exclude fatty fish meal ( include salmon , tuna , mackerel , herring ) , fish-oil supplement , flax product , walnut , omega-3-enriched egg study . Vitamin supplement natural health product strictly forbid entire experimental period , exception calcium vitamin D , allow stable dose . Although alcohol consumption permit study intake exceed one serving ( 12-15 g alcohol ) per day , forbidden 4 day precede various test end treatment phase . Subjects also instruct maintain usual physical activity except 4 day precede blood sample various stage study , ask remain sedentary .</detailed_description>
