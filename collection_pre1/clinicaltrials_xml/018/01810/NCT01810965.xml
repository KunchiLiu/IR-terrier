	<detailed_description>Hemochromatosis type 1 one frequent genetic disease since genetic predisposition ( homozygosity C282Y mutation HFE gene ) encounter 3/1000 white subject ( 5/1000 Brittany , France ) . For half predisposed subject , phenotypic expression disease need treatment . This treatment base upon repeat bloodletting generally consider simple , safe effective . Nevertheless , still question regard physiopathological justification clinical implication . Indeed , bloodletting could cause increase non-transferrin bound iron ( NTBI ) particularly reactive form call labile plasma iron ( LPI ) This adverse physiopathological effect could clinical consequence could link articular consequence aggravate treatment . The primary objective explore effect bloodletting upon plasmatic concentration NTBI . The secondary objective : - explore impact bloodletting upon different parameter iron metabolism particular LPI , hepcidinemia marker erythropoiesis ; - explore basal nycthemeral characteristic new parameter iron metabolism ( hepcidin , NTBI , LPI ) hemochromatosis patient . The demonstration adverse effect bloodletting upon iron metabolism would allow therapeutic innovation base upon association bloodletting oral chelation induction treatment type 1 hemochromatosis , generally hepcidino deficient form hemochromatosis .</detailed_description>
