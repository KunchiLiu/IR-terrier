	<brief_title>The `` START '' ( Streamlined ART Initiation Strategy ) Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RATIONALE : In Africa , 50-75 % HIV-infected , adult fail initiate ( FTI ) ART encounter delay month even eligibility CD4+ T-cell test clinical criterion establish . Recent randomized trial include ACTG Protocol 5164 , ACTG 5221 , CAMELIA SAPIT demonstrate delay even week ART initiation increase mortality among patient present active opportunistic infection . Even among without active infection , mortality among untreated person CD4 &lt; 350 approach 15/100 person-years - large proportion avoidable patient present care . New dissemination implementation strategy generalizable across resource-limited setting need address FTI make public health approach effective . The overall goal multi-component START strategy initiate great number eligible patient short amount time possible , maintain safety , efficacy cost effectiveness . HYPOTHESIS : The START intervention , combine intervention use provider education , novel technology reinforce feedback , increase rapidity completeness ART initiation . INTERVENTION : START clinic-level ( individual-patient ) intervention catalyze process ART initiation among HIV-infected adult meet CD4-based criterion combination ART ( e.g. , adult CD4 T cell level &lt; 350/ul ) . The three START component : ( 1 ) real-time point-of-care CD4 test use Alere PIMA platform ascertain treatment eligibility real time first presentation care , ( 2 ) target knowledge transfer ( i.e. , dissemination ) recent scientific evidence regard effect rapid ART initiation survival front line health care worker ; 3 ) feedback report clinic provider . There three component represent empirically validate step PRECEED implementation model . STUDY DESIGN : A cluster-randomized , step-wedge trail 20 clinic operate Makerere Joint AIDS Program . Four clinic site randomly assign START 6-month interval month six 24 three-year trial . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE 1 . Evaluate programmatic change START cumulative incidence ART initiation 14 day first clinical eligibility ART treatment eligible HIV-infected patient receive care routine program condition large , multi-site , HIV care program Uganda . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES 1 . Evaluate effect START incidence mortality treatment-eligible , HIV-infected patient . 2 . Evaluate effect START plasma HIV RNA level one year treatment eligibility HIV-infected patient present care multi-site , HIV care program . 3 . Evaluate effect START incidence vertical transmission treatment-eligible , HIV-infected woman . 4 . Evaluate effect START retention among ART-eligible , HIV-infected patient study site . 5 . To assess cost-effectiveness START intervention . 6 . To evaluate adaptation START intervention clinical care qualitative analysis counsel interaction limited interview counselor patient regard experience counsel identification content current counseling activity change time . OUTCOMES : The primary outcome study ART initiation . Secondary outcome all-cause mortality , plasma HIV RNA one year clinic presentation , vertical transmission event cost-effectiveness measure . ANALYTIC PLAN : Primary analysis primary outcome : We treat outcome binary , consider patient either initiate ARV 14 day . In word , outcome ART start within 14 day less met start 14 day inclusive ( &lt; =14 day ) , otherwise outcome met . Patients less 14 day observation time cross-over end study database closure analyze . This mean even patient initiate ART le 14 day possible observation time , event count . Also , death prior ARV initiation consider non-initiations . The analysis use mixed effect logistic regression model ( meglm Stata 14.0 ) Normal random effect site fix effect intervention . Marginal proportion intervention control calculate use `` margin '' command Stata . We represent effect risk ratio marginal proportion . Secondary sensitivity analyse primary outcome 1 . We adjust primary analysis calendar time specify restrict cubic spline . 2 . We restrict analysis incidently eligible population . 3 . We perform analysis include observation time censor less 14 day observation due database closure cross-over . 4 . We carry analysis estimate effect cross intervention condition among patient eligible started ART time clinic change control intervention introduction time-varying covariate represent cross date multivariable regression model .</detailed_description>
