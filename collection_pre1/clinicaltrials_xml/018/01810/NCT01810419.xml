	<detailed_description>The diagnosis splenomegaly ( abnormal enlargement spleen ) extremely important manage patient many medical condition . The ability recognize enlarged spleen timely manner impact patient outcomes . Although physical exam use confidently diagnosis massive enlargement spleen , evaluate less degree splenomegaly bedside prof difficult . In current practice , gold standard diagnosis splenomegaly standard abdominal ultrasound . The prevalence splenomegaly patient several medical condition blood disorder cirrhosis relatively high . Therefore , demand abdominal ultrasound evergrowing similarly cost caring patient diseases increase . Examination spleen one core competency expect student resident learn part training . This physical diagnosis manoeuver frequently use examine resident Royal College level determine fitness practice . Unfortunately , sensitivity specificity examination spleen bedside good . With introduction handheld ultrasound ( HCU ) device , rapid bedside assessment patient possible . The Pocket-sized Vscan Ultrasound device ( Vscan ) ( GE Healthcare , USA ) allow 2D image 3.5 inch display show comparable image quality standard ultrasound application . The Vscan HCU device use point care evaluate number condition greatly impact treatment decision medical patient bedside . The ability recognize splenomegaly timely manner impact patient outcome . In addition , use technology could significantly impact training standard student resident . It remain unclear whether bedside evaluation Vscan able accurately measure spleen size . Our study aim determine diagnostic accuracy Vscan use trained ultrasonographers , patient vary degree splenomegaly . If reliably show trained ultrasonographer accurately characterize spleen size bedside handheld device , next stage study involve train medical resident use handheld ultrasound see also reliably assess spleen size .</detailed_description>
