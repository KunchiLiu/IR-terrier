	<detailed_description>Chronic Graft versus Host Disease ( cGvHD ) identify leading cause late non-relapse mortality Hemopoietic Stem Cell Transplant ( HSCT ) survivor . Up standard satisfactory treatment patient exist . cGVHD immune-mediated disease , result complex interaction donor recipient adaptive immunity , exact pathogenesis still incompletely define . Many cGVHD patient show skin visceral involvement fibrotic scleroderma-like feature ; recent experimental data suggest patient cGVHD fibrotic/sclerotic manifestation , agonistic antibody activate platelet-derived growth factor receptor ( PDGF-R ) , like patient Systemic Scleroderma ( SS ) , suggest similar pathogenesis two disease ; recently demonstrate up-regulation PDGF-R intracellular pathway lead increase reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) , consequent increase collagen synthesis , , turn , contribute pathologic lesion observe cGVHD SS . Many data strongly suggest , among profibrotic cytokine , besides PDGF , also transform growth factor β ( TGF-β ) play relevant role pathogenesis fibrotic damage . Blockade PDGF TGF-β signal show reduce development fibrosis various experimental model . Recent vitro data show Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor ( TKI ) , Imatinib strongly inhibit PDGF TGF-β intracellular signaling . Considering selective , dual inhibition Imatinib TGF-β/PDGF pathway , conduct pilot study evaluate safety activity Imatinib series patient affected refractory cGVHD , fibrotic/sclerotic feature . In 2008 start national pilot multicentric study ( support AIFA ) confirm preliminary data ; , 24 patient enrol , interim analysis confirm Imatinib low dosage safe well tolerated setting ; however response rate observe second study 50 % sixth month , apparently inferior first pilot experience . Two possible reason could responsible discrepancy : first , last study , response criterion stringent , relate multi-organ evaluation ( accord NIH Consensus Conference GVHD ) ; secondly , average age patient enrol second trial significantly superior one ( first study observe best response young patient ) . It 's important point higher tolerate dose Imatinib setting patient significantly inferior ( 100-200 mg ) dosage currently use patient Chronic Myeloid Leukemia . Like Imatinib , Nilotinib TKI good tolerability profile suggest good compliance , especially frail patient poor haematological tolerance poor Quality Life ( QoL ) , affect steroid-refractory cGvHD . Therefore population allotransplanted patient , steroid-refractory cGvHD , innovative approach novel TKI justify follow reason : 1 . Both first-generation TKI second-generation TKI largely use long period many patient malignancy , show good safety profile ; 2 . Imatinib achieve preliminary encouraging result refractory cGvHD patient , represent frail truly orphan population poor quality life ; 3 . The availability new TKI good tolerability profile achieve good response rate , ( may consider perhaps cosmetic result ) , could also well tolerate long time , allow improve compliance duration treatment respond patient , consequent impact long term outcome transplantation procedure . Nilotinib novel aminopyrimidine , protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor develop base crystallographic study interaction IM ( imatinib ) ABL ( tyrosine kinase product Abelson gene ) , increase affinity bind capacity derivative wild type ABL important , ABL mutant main cause IM resistance . Nilotinib active TK Imatinib , namely Abl , BCR-ABL ( BCR-ABL oncoprotein product BCR-ABL fusion gene ) , PDGFR-α β , c-Kit , least 10 time potent BCR-ABL . Moreover , Nilotinib active , like Imatinib , several TKs , include VEGFR-2 , c-ERB-2 , FLT3 ( fetal liver tyrosine kinase 3 ) , IGFR-1R ( insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 ) , Jak-2 , RAS , lk AKT . More interesting important ( Table 2 ) , Nilotinib active Imatinib number BCR-ABL mutant , exception T315I . It notice proliferation assay concentration 50 % effect inhibit Nilotinib low 50 nM , apart two BCR-ABL mutant ( E255K E255V ) IC50 600 700 nM . We design prospective , phase I/II , non-randomized , open-label , multicenter study determine safety efficacy Nilotinib population steroid-refractory/or steroid-dependent cGvHD . In phase I approximately 3-24 patient need find MTD depend toxicity see . In phase II MTD use define efficacy Nilotinib cGvHD steroid- refractory steroid dependent population , characteristic previously Imatinib-treated population . STATISTICAL DESIGN AND SAMPLE SIZE Phase I ( Dose find ) . Phase I conduct accord standard 3+3 design . Initially , three patient receive low dose Nilotinib , 200 mg QD . If dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) , define dose include Grade III/IV toxicity NCI-COMMON TOXICITY CRITERIA criterion observe current cohort least one month treatment , next three patient treat next high dose Nilotinib ( 300 mg QD ) , 200 mg BID , 300 mg BID ) . If two DLTs observe , Phase I end MTD define next low dosage . If observe one DLT ( 1/3 patient ) , treat three patient dosage ; n't another DLT three patient , increase dosage next cohort ; observe another DLT cohort ( total DLT 2/6 patient ) , mean exceeded MTD , study continue phase II use previous dose . MTD consider maximum dosage use treat six patient achieve one DLT , minimum dosage dosage achieve two DLT . In case limit Grade II toxicity meeting data safety monitor board ( DSMB ) might hold decide continue study . Pharmacokinetics : pharmacokinetics serum level Nilotinib determine patient within phase use mass-spectrometry assay , thanks collaboration Professor F. Pane , Naples . Doses escalate beyond 600 200 mg/die . Then algorithm proceed Phase II . The dose estimate MTD phase I use phase II , dose review may adjust accordingly DSMB analysis toxicity obtain phase I patient least 3 month therapy . Phase II ( Clinical efficacy part ) To evaluate efficacy Nilotinib treatment study follow Minimax design . This design consist two subsequent enrolment phase . 19 patient recruit first stage , enrolment 6 response happen , trial end . In second stage , 20 patient recruit . The upper limit second stage rejection drug 16 . The whole number recruit patient 39 early termination probability 67 % . If first stage , number response fewer equal pre-determined value , r1 n1 , PET equal B ( r1 ; n1 , p ) B denote cumulative distribution function evaluate r1 random variable binomially distributed parameter n1 p true probability response . If trial continue second stage , drug reject end stage r few response observe . Based best result observe literature experimental treatment steroid refractory cGvHD , choose overall minimal response ( CR+PR ) rate least 50 % , p1=0.50 . The rate ineffectiveness first stage require great 30 % , ( attention pay correlation disease treatment ) , p0=0.30 . If significance level alpha=0.05 , require power 1-beta=0.80 , n1=19 , r1=6 accord table . The study follow Good Clinical Practice rule , ongoing trial monitor promoter GITMO `` Trials Office '' . Primary objective Phase I The primary objective Phase I evaluate safety Nilotinib define MTD drug . Primary objective Phase II : In phase II MTD use define efficacy Nilotinib cGVHD steroid refractory population . In phase , primary end-point Overall Response Rate ( ORR ) , define objective Improvement sixth month , accord modify NIH Consensus Conference criterion . Secondary objective : Reduction stop concomitant immune-suppressive treatment ( steroid , Extra-corporeal Photopheresis , Cyclosporin-A ) . Evaluation Nilotinib tolerance along 6 month therapy : incidence Serious Adverse Event ( grade &gt; 2 accord WHO scale ) patient refractory cGVHD -Evaluation Nilotinib activity patient : skin fibrosis ; lung fibrosis : Bronchiolitis Obliterans Organizing Pneumonia ( BOOP ) and/or pulmonary hypertension ; visceral fibrosis . Appropriate assessment attachment use measure response district , accord cGVHD assessment worksheet NIH Consensus Conference Documents modify Rodnan Score . TTF ( Time Treatment failure ) . OS 1 year start Nilotinib therapy . Global Health state evaluate Health Assessment Questionnaire The cGVHD symptom scale Biological objective To evaluate relationship serum level Nilotinib response : Evaluation immunomodulatory effect Nilotinib T population . To evaluate relationship response Nilotinib anti-PDGF-R antibody activity/titer Analysis expression select auto-antibody complementarity-determining region ( CDR ) RNA cGVHD patient . Evaluation role PDGF-R TGFB-R pathway activation cGVHD patient 's skin sclerosis . To evaluate fibroblast activation pathway modification Nilotinib administration vitro : decrease de-phosphorylation fibroblast activation marker ( ROS , Ha-Ras , extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 , collagen type I , Smad , C-Abl ) index PRGF-R/TGFB-R pathway inactivation ( evaluated patient 's fibroblast skin biopsy immortalize fibroblast ) Nilotinib treatment . To set reliable easy technique ( alternative functional test use previous experimental work , base ROS output murine fibroblast , incubate patient purified immunoglobulin ) screen patient presence stimulate anti-PDGFR antibody Nilotinib treatment .</detailed_description>
