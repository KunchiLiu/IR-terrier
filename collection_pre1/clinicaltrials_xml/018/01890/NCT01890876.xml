	<brief_summary>Concentric ( CE ) eccentric ( EE ) exercise may differently affect glucose metabolism may additionally modify exercise perform hypoxia , e.g . moderate ( 1500 - 2500 ) high ( 2500 - 3500 ) altitude . However , data effect glucose metabolism due CE EE hypoxia scarce would utmost importance consider increase number person suffer impaired glucose tolerance diabetes unique opportunity provide mountainous region Alps perform CE ( e.g . uphill hike ) EE ( downhill hiking , downhill ski ) altitude 1500 - 3500 m. Metabolic responses exercise may largely mediate interleukin 6 ( IL-6 ) , predominantly derive contract limb may support maintenance metabolic homeostasis exercise . In addition , IL-6 elevate acute chronic altitude exposure least partly mediate via adrenergic stimulation . Thus , type exercise well hypoxia may contribute IL-6 elevation difference serum IL-6 concentration might help explain distinction response glucose metabolism CE EE low moderate high altitude . 32 male subject suffer pre-diabetes randomly assign downhill ( EE ) uphill ( CE ) walk group perform 9 session low altitude ( 860 - 1360 ) 9 session moderate high altitude ( 2000 - 2500 ) . Between normoxic hypoxic condition break approximately 12 month . Measurements glucose metabolism , IL-6 plasma concentration perform pre , mid ( day 5 ) post intervention . Moreover anthropometric , strength exercise capacity characteristic perform pre post intervention . We hypothesize EE hypoxia effective modulation glycemic control pre-diabetic men CE hypoxia well EE CE normoxia . It suggest effect glucose metabolism associate change plasma IL-6 concentration . EE hypoxia expect result persistent rise plasma IL-6 concentration CE hypoxia normoxia pronounce rise plasma IL-6 EE normoxia .</brief_summary>
