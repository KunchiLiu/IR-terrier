	<brief_summary>The combination protein resistance exercise seem one effective tool counteract sarcopenia . Randomized controlled trial support possibility still scarce . These series clinical trial aim investigate therapeutic role protein ingestion combine resistance training frail elderly participant . These study mainly address follow research question : Is protein source ( i.e. , whey versus soy ) factor induce differential anabolic response ? Does dietary protein consumption dictate whey/training-induced anabolic response ? Does leucine supplementation promote anabolic response ? Does co-supplementation creatine whey protein foster anabolic response ?</brief_summary>
