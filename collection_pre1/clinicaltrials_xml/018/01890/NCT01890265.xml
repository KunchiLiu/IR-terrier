	<detailed_description>The study amend accordingly February 2016 allow enrollment subgroup subject ( N=60 ) allow receive treatment approve IPF therapy pirfenidone nintedanib background therapy . These additional subject stratify background therapy , randomize FG-3019 placebo follow 24 week . The main objective study remain safety . PK sample assess drug concentration also collect .

	<criteria>1 . Age 40 80 year , inclusive . 2 . Diagnosis IPF define current international guideline ( Raghu , 2011 ) . Each subject must one following : ( 1 ) Usual Interstitial Pneumonia ( UIP ) Pattern available HRCT scan ; ( 2 ) Possible UIP Pattern available HRCT scan surgical lung biopsy within 4 year Screening show UIP Pattern . 3 . History IPF ≤5 year duration onset define date first diagnosis IPF HRCT surgical lung biopsy . 4 . Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis define HRCT scan Screening , evidence ≥10 % &lt; 50 % parenchymal fibrosis ( reticulation ) &lt; 25 % honeycombing , within whole lung , determine HRCT central reader . 5 . FVC percent predict value ≥55 % Screening . 6 . Female subject childbearing potential ( include &lt; 1 year postmenopausal ) must willing use medically acceptable method contraception , example , oral contraceptive , depot progesterone , intrauterine device . Male subject female partner childbearing potential use birth control describe must use barrier method contraception ( e.g. , condom ) surgically sterile ( i.e. , vasectomy ) . 7 . All subject Arm A whose FVC percent predict value great original pretreatment baseline Randomized Treatment Period offer participation Extended Treatment Period 8 . All subject assign Placebo ( Arm B ) offer participation Extended Treatment Phase . 9 . For Substudy : Receiving treatment IPF stable dose pirfenidone stable dose nintedanib least 3 month screen initiation willing continue treatment pirfenidone nintedanib accord correspond approve label prescribe physician , include list safety requirement ( e.g. , liver function test , avoidance sunlight sunlamp exposure wear sunscreen protective clothing daily pirfenidone , smoke cessation ) . 1 . Women pregnant nursing . 2 . Infiltrative lung disease IPF , include type idiopathic interstitial pneumonia ( Travis , 2013 ) ; lung disease related exposure fibrogenic agent environmental toxin drug ; type occupational lung disease ; granulomatous lung disease ; pulmonary vascular disease ; systemic disease , include vasculitis connective tissue disease . 3 . HRCT scan finding Screening inconsistent UIP Pattern , determine HRCT central reader . 4 . Pathology diagnosis surgical lung biopsy anything UIP Pattern , determine local pathologist . 5 . The Investigator judge sustain improvement severity IPF 12 month prior Screening , base change FVC , diffuse capacity lung carbon monoxide ( DLCO ) , and/or HRCT scan chest . 6 . Clinically important abnormal laboratory test . 7 . Upper low respiratory tract infection type within 4 week first screen visit . 8 . Acute exacerbation IPF within 3 month first screen visit . 9 . Use medication treat IPF within 5 halflives Day 1 dosing . If monoclonal antibody use , last dose antibody must least 4 week Day 1 dosing . This apply subject enrol Main Study . 10 . Use investigational drug , include investigational drug IPF , within 4 week prior Day 1 dosing . 11 . History cancer diagnosis type 3 year precede Screening , exclude nonmelanomatous skin cancer , localize bladder cancer , situ cancer 12 . Diffusing capacity ( DLCO ) less 30 % predict value 13 . History allergic anaphylactic reaction human , humanize , chimeric murine monoclonal antibody . 14 . Previous treatment FG3019 . 15 . Body weight great 130 kilogram .</criteria>
