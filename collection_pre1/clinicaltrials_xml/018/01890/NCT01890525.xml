	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare different method collect amount radiation exposure patient receive clinical study . As part PROMISE study , Duke Clinical Research Institute Outcomes Follow-up Group contact patient every six month ask heart procedure test . This information use estimate amount radiation may receive heart test study study , PROMISE-SAFER . Patients ask collect information heart test receive time enrol PROMISE study . At conclusion study , able determine method accurate collect amount radiation exposure clinical study . Through study hope develop improved methodology estimate cumulative radiation exposure cardiac imaging . Comprehensive measurement cumulative radiation exposure patient may critically important minimize potential harm future study clinical practice .</brief_summary>
