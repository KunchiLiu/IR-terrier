	<brief_title>Study Changes Total Cholesterol Levels Function Consuming Supplement Designed Improve Cardiovascular Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To evaluate safety efficacy food-source nutrient comparing change total cholesterol level , 44 blood chemistry , self-reported quality life function consume two different functional-food supplement versus placebo 60-day study . Upon completion pre-study screening , receive explanation requirement , risk benefit , complete informed consent interview research coordinator , subject execute write informed consent . Subjects randomly assign one three study group . Relevant Background Information . A factor lead development vascular disease , lead cause death industrialize nation , elevate serum cholesterol . It estimate 19 % Americans age 20 74 year age high serum cholesterol . However , analysis 10,000 test result database subject similar likely participate study , find 37 % subject TC score 200 250 10.3 % 250 . The prevalent form vascular disease arteriosclerosis , condition associate thicken harden arterial wall . The regulation whole-body cholesterol homeostasis involve regulation intestinal cholesterol absorption , cellular cholesterol trafficking , modulation cholesterol biosynthesis , bile acid biosynthesis , steroid biosynthesis catabolism cholesterol-containing plasma lipoprotein . Regulation intestinal cholesterol absorption proven effective mean regulate serum cholesterol level . Ad-Chol-Pre ( ACP ) functional food ingredient design inhibit cholesterol absorption . ACP freeze dry defatted egg powder contain specific Anti-NPCIL1 ( Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 ) IgY . NPC1L1 known biological target cholesterol-uptake inhibitor , Ezetimibe . In previous unpublished pilot study examine safety efficacy ACP include : - ACP show produce statistically inhibition [ 3H ] -Cholesterol absorption 50 ug/ml ( P &lt; 0.05 ) NPC1L1 over-expressing HepG2 cell line compare inhibition 10ug/ml Ezetimibe alone . - I preliminary unpublished animal study , ACP show significantly inhibit radiolabelled cholesterol . ACP find significantly low total cholesterol ( 38 % ~56 % ) LDL cholesterol ( 46~57 % ) blood animal feed feed high fat diet 6 week .</detailed_description>
