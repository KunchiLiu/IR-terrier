	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety Alogliptin Metformin Fixed-Dose Combination Participants With Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study fixed-dose combination tablet alogliptin metformin treat people diabetes . This study look glycemic control people take alogliptin metformin FDC compare alogliptin metformin alone . The study enroll approximately 640 patient . Participants randomly assign ( chance , like flip coin ) one four treatment groupsâ€”which remain undisclosed participant study doctor study ( unless urgent medical need ) : - Alogliptin 12.5 mg twice daily ( BID ) - Metformin hydrochloride ( HCl ) 500 mg BID - Alogliptin 12.5 mg Metformin HCl 500 mg FDC BID - Placebo ( dummy inactive pill ) - tablet/capsule look like study drug active ingredient . All participant ask take 2 tablet 1 capsule twice day time day throughout study . All participant ask record hypoglycemic event diary . This multi-center trial conduct China , South Korea , Taiwan Malaysia . The overall time participate study 34 week . Participants make 11 visit clinic .</detailed_description>
