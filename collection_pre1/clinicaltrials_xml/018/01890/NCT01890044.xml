	<brief_title>Multicenter Registry Comparative Effectiveness Analysis Venous Thromboembolism Trauma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The VTE relate research question , identify EAST Management Guidelines need study , : 1 . While numerous risk factor VTE identify report , 2 Level 1 evidence support them—spine fracture spinal cord injury . Many report risk factor identify study protocols surveillance , report patient symptom , use data large administrative database National Trauma Data Bank4 . It also show frequency diagnosis deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) increase duplex image extremity undertaken5 . Thus , aggressive concurrent surveillance program DVT aggressive work suspect pulmonary embolism ( PE ) undertaken : 1 . Are unknown under-reported risk factor ? 2 . Is hierarchy risk among factor ? For example , long bone fracture associate high incidence VTE close head injury ? 3 . Do closed head injury AIS &gt; 3 degree risk epidural hematoma risky subdural hematoma ? 4 . What constitute high high risk ? 2 . What comparative efficacy value6 unfractionated heparin ( UH ) , low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) direct thrombin inhibitor ( DTI ) without associate mechanical prophylaxis ( MP ) prevent VTE trauma patient ? In examine question , morbidity agent must carefully determine , particularly respect intracranial injury intra-abdominal solid viscus injury . 3 . In trauma patient develop VTE best treatment long ? 4 . Should trauma patient develop proximal deep venous thrombosis ( pDVT ) undergo workup thrombophilia base degree `` inverse risk '' ( inverse risk mean patient minor injury , think low risk , develop pDVT ) ? Similarly , trauma patient develop pulmonary embolism ( PE ) undergo workup thrombophilia base degree `` inverse risk '' [ question 4 add importance answer question 1a 1b ] ? 5 . A recent meta-analysis observational study suggest prophylactic inferior vena cava filter ( PICVF ) significantly reduce risk PE ( OR : 0.09-0.49 ) 7 . The author meta-analysis point number methodological flaws study select analysis . Most importantly , retrospective study historical control use pharmacologic prophylaxis uniform among study evaluate . Despite report , continue significant practice variation use PIVCF role PIVCF care trauma patient remain question . Thus , aggressive concurrent surveillance program DVT aggressive work suspect PE undertaken : 1 . Are patient perceived high risk VTE also relative absolute contraindication pharmacologic prophylaxis receive PIVCF ? 2 . Do PIVCF reduce risk PE trauma patient risk adjustment do ? 3 . Do PIVCF value trauma patient high risk VTE , high risk trauma patient moderate risk trauma patient ? In examine question , morbidity PIVCF must carefully determine , particularly respect placement ( include local complication insertion site , migration degree tilt ) long-term complication . 6 . Because DVT asymptomatic clinical examination extremely insensitive . Therefore , surveillance low extremity venous system necessary . However , use routine surveillance controversial . It also know venous duplex exam , accurate symptomatic patient , quite insensitive asymptomatic patient . In addition , surveillance scanning hamper external fixators wound ( many 30 % extremity scan reason10 . Finally , uncommon trauma patient PE ( even fatal PE ) negative followup surveillance low extremity ( LE ) upper extremity ( UE ) venous system . This would suggest either surveillance duplex inaccurate , clot arise vein could well interrogate duplex ( i.e. , hypogastric ) , clot arose de novo pulmonary artery11 . Thus , aggressive concurrent surveillance program DVT aggressive work suspect PE undertaken : 1 . Does `` protocolized '' surveillance ( surveillance asymptomatic patient ) value ? In word , quality outcome ( determine presence asymptomatic thrombus vein extremity ) justify cost ? 2 . What constitute effective protocol term initial scan do frequency subsequent scan ? 3 . What fate peroneal vein tibial vein clot ? Does vary depend degree risk ( i.e. , likely propagate patient high risk compare patient low risk ) ? The question could pose respect soleal vein gastrocnemius vein clot . 4 . Does magnetic resonance venography role high risk trauma patient surveillance modality—particularly pelvic fracture severe LE fracture reliably scan ? 5 . Does contrast venography role high risk trauma patient surveillance modality , particularly patient PE negative duplex ? 6 . Since show numerous author surveillance bias regard diagnosis DVT ( i.e. , diagnosis often report hospital frequent scanning5 , frequency diagnosis PE increase number chest CT angiogram perform ? 7 . Recent study suggest association local14 systemic11 inflammation pulmonary thrombosis ( perhaps embolism ) . Is increase risk DVT primary pulmonary thrombosis trauma patient associated inflammatory process sepsis , urinary tract infection ( UTI ) pneumonia ( PNA ) ? What constellation local injury put patient risk pulmonary thrombosis ? We propose perform extensive literature review question produce state art publication follow-up EAST Management Guidelines provide platform multicenter study question .</detailed_description>
