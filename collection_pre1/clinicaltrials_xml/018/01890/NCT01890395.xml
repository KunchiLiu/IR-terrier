	<detailed_description>The rationale study recognition mitochondrial DNA Damage Associated Molecular Patterns ( mtDAMPs ) accumulate circulation severe injury . Furthermore study severely injured patient identify mtDAMPS increase 3-28 fold patient eventually develop multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( MODS ) compare severely traumatized patient develop MODS . The relative risk death MODS severe trauma increase 8-20 time patient elevate mt DAMP level . This study do correlate mitochondrial damp level surgical trauma assess time course level mtDAMPs type surgical procedure . We believe information help u determine time course event trigger development multiple organ dysfunction see surgery .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Patients @ USAMC undergoing surgical operation expect microcirculatory change , i.e. , CABG , open heart , aortic revascularizing operation , general surgical operation colon resection , bowel resection surgical procedure subject could expect might develop multiple system organ failure .</criteria>
