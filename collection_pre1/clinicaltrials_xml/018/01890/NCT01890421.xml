	<brief_summary>Subjects evaluate suspect known Coronary artery Disease ( CAD ) base sign and/or symptom , invite participate study . The duration subject study may range 2 day 4-6 week . One four visit study doctor require . This study investigate diagnostic result gadobutrol-enhanced Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( CMRI ) image regard detection ( sensitivity ) exclusion ( specificity ) coronary artery disease utilize uniform image acquisition software . The CMR image test either result routine clinical Coronary Angiography ( CA ) Computed Tomography Angiography ( CTA ) , use standard reference . The CA/CTA may perform 4 week prior enrollment schedule 4/6 week study . CMRI CA/CTA image collect independent image review ( blind read ) .</brief_summary>
