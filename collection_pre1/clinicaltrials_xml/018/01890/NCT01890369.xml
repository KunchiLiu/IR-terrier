	<detailed_description>Muscles stay constant size much adult life yet dramatic wasting see advanced age ill health . A good understanding muscle regulate size help design treatment slow waste disease promote active aging . We plan study group old men , ~70yrs , age muscle bulk start decrease , observe muscle respond feed . We provide drink contains digest product proteins muscle build . Taking blood sample tiny biopsy muscle ( do local anaesthesia ) allow u measure muscle turnover able measure long meal muscle actively take nutrient become `` full '' . We also measure long muscle remain `` full '' return state stimulate take nutrient . We also explore leucine , one component part protein ( especially meat dairy product ) food widely use supplement , promote early re-stimulation muscle eating .</detailed_description>
