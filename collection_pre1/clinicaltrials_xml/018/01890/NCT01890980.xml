	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn Wilms Tumor-1 ( WT1 ) vaccine , give combination montanide GM-CSF , help prevent delay mesothelioma come back surgery treatment . The safety vaccine also test . Montanide GM-CSF design cause white blood cell grow , may help increase immune response . WT1 protein cancer cell regulate gene expression cause cell growth . Mesothelioma tumor usually high level WT1 . The WT1 vaccine design cause increase immune response create drug combination ( like montanide GM-CSF ) direct mesothelioma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Study Adjuvant WT-1 Analog Peptide Vaccine MPM Patients After MSK10-134</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : When study open , 2 group . In 1 group , participant receive montanide GM-CSF . This group stop enrol participant . All participant receive montanide , GM-CSF , WT1 vaccine . You receive montanide injection skin every 2 week 12 week ( 6 dos ) . You receive WT-1 vaccine time receive montanide . You also receive GM-CSF injection skin day receive montanide 2 day receive montanide time ( 12 dose GM-CSF total ) . If doctor think best interest , might teach inject GM-CSF . Study Visits : On Week 2 , Week 6 , Week 12 , physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . You also ask drug may take side effect may . At Weeks 6 12 , follow test procedure also perform : - Your performance status record . - Blood ( 4 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw check level SMRP . - Blood ( 7 tablespoon ) draw check immune response study drug ( ) ( Week 12 ) . At Week 12 early doctor think need , chest x-ray CT scan chest check status disease . Length Study : You receive study drug 12 week . You take study study doctor think best interest intolerable side effect . Your participation study follow-up visit . Follow-Up : Within 30 day stop receive study drug , physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . You also ask drug may take side effect may . Every 3 month 2 year stop receive study drug , follow test procedure perform : - Your medical history record - You physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - You ask drug may take side effect may . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test measure level SMRP . - You CT scan chest check status disease This investigational study . GM-CSF FDA approve help immune system patient acute myelogenous leukemia . Montanide Wilms Tumor-1 ( WT1 ) FDA approve commercially available . They currently use research purpose . The combination WT-1 vaccine montanide GM-CSF FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Up 60 patient take part multicenter study . Up 20 enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
