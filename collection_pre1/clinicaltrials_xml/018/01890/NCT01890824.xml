	<brief_summary>Following chemotherapy , breast cancer patient primarily gain fat mass lose muscle mass . Both depletion muscle increase fat mass breast cancer patient relate short survival , decrease skeletal muscle mass function may result fatigue inactivity , contribute fat mass change responsible chemo-toxicity increase mortality . The purpose study provide detail insight chemotherapy relate change lipid metabolism gut digestion absorption fat breast cancer patient compare match healthy control . This provide require information necessary implement new strategy develop optimal nutritional regimen breast cancer patient . The hypothesis chemotherapy breast cancer relate alter gut function absorption increase fat synthesis lead fat accumulation . In addition , examine effect cancer , chemotherapy , gender compare fat digestion/absorption fat metabolism breast cancer chemotherapy , age match healthy female male control .</brief_summary>
