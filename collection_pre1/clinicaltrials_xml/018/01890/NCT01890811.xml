	<brief_summary>Weight loss commonly occur patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , negatively influence quality life , treatment response survival . Loss muscle protein generally central component weight loss CKD patient patient also reduction fat mass bone density , independent severity disease state . Attempts reverse weight muscle loss CKD improve nutritional status nutritional supplementation unsuccessful currently approve therapy . Purpose study provide detail insight disease relate gut function obtain information gut permeability , digestion absorption glucose , fat protein CKD patient compare match healthy control . Additionally , examine whether protein amino acid metabolism disturb CKD patient compare healthy control . This provide require information lead implement new strategy develop optimal nutritional regimen order enhance nutritional status , quality life survival relation kidney disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study involve one test day approximately 7-8 hour . On test day subject ingest sugar drink ass gut permeability gut function , protein meal measure digestion/absorption anabolic response food intake . Subjects also receive mixture amino acid make little heavy normal , call stable isotope . This stable isotope use investigate protein behavior body ( protein kinetics ) . Blood ( 100-120 ml total ) urine sample collect 7.5 hour .</detailed_description>
