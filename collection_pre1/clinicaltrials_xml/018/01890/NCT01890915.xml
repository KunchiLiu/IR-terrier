	<brief_summary>The deleterious effect hyperthermia well appreciated able-bodied person . However , consequence impair regulation normal body temperature cognitive performance person tetraplegia know . This study provide preliminary finding necessary future work design explore physical medical intervention improve temperature regulation tetraplegia goal improve clinical care , health , quality life . The propose study consist 1 visit 20 subject ( 10 tetraplegia , 10 control ) expose 81°F 40 minute 95° F 2 hour . Physiological well psychological process monitor subject study safety determine difference responses exposure hot ambient temperature</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Body Temperature Persons With Tetraplegia When Exposed Heat</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>After cervical spinal cord injury ( SCI ) motor , sensory autonomic deficit cause , among detriment , blunt ability maintain constant core temperature . Impaired thermoregulation leave person tetraplegia susceptible hyperthermia able-bodied person ( AB ) . There paucity work address thermoregulatory response person SCI hot ambient temperature , even less study address effect temperature cognitive performance . The goal pilot study : improve understand thermoregulatory mechanisms individual tetraplegia expose heat determine effect impair thermoregulatory mechanism cognitive performance exposure 35°C 2 hour . In order address goal design study methodology consist compare physiological psychological response two study group ( tetraplegia versus AB control ) thermoneutral ( 27°C ) hot ( 35°C ) environment .</detailed_description>
