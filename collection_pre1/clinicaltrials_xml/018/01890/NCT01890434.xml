	<brief_summary>Subjects evaluate suspect known Coronary artery Disease ( CAD ) base sign and/or symptom , invite participate study . The duration subject study may range 2 day 4-6 week . One four visit study doctor require . The primary objective study demonstrate sensitivity specificity gadobutrol-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( CMRI ) exceed pre-specified minimum performance threshold 60 % 55 % , respectively , show superior sensitivity unenhanced wall motion CMRI vasodilator rest/stress detection significant CAD . The CMR image acquire uniform imaging acquisition software evaluate either result routine clinical Coronary Angiography ( CA ) Computed Tomography Angiography ( CTA ) , standard reference . CMRI CA/CTA image collect independent image review ( blind read ) .</brief_summary>
