Radiation Therapy 1 . MRI Fused CT Simulation 2 . Neurocognitive Function Testing 3 . Quality Life Assessment Arm 1 Whole brain radiation therapy deliver via IMRT ( 37.5 Gy brain tumor , 30 Gy uninvolved brain 15 fraction ) , mean dose less 18 Gy scalp Arm 2 Conventional whole brain radiation therapy ( 37.5 Gy brain tumor uninvolved brain 15 fraction ) Patient Population : ( See Section 3.0 Eligibility ) At least one radiologically diagnosed brain metastasis associate histologically proven diagnosis nonhematopoietic malignancy . Patients must classify RTOG RPA class I RPA class II 1.0 INTRODUCTION 1.1 Adverse Effects Whole-Brain Radiotherapy ( WBRT ) Whole brain radiotherapy ( WBRT ) remain standard treatment approach patient multiple brain metastasis . WBRT show achieve rapid palliation neurological symptom improve overall survival compare corticosteroid alone patient multiple brain metastasis 1 . Additionally , adjuvant WBRT show improve local control time neurocognitive function decline patient limit ( 1 4 ) brain metastasis treat surgery stereotactic radiosurgery 2-4 . Despite significant technical advance radiation delivery increase survival tumor demonstrate sensitivity systemic therapy , conventional WBRT materially change past 50 year 5 . Conventional WBRT generally well tolerate , save alopecia , fatigue short-term neurocognitive decline patient short life expectancy ( ≤ 6 month ) 6-8 . In recent randomized trial MD Anderson , WBRT SRS increase risk neurocognitive decline ≥ 5 point assess Hopkins Verbal Learning Test 4 month treatment compare SRS alone ( 49 % vs. 23 % , p &lt; 0.05 ) 9 . In study , development subsequent brain metastasis significant contributor cognitive decline 2 , 10-11 . In long term survivor ( ≥ 12 month ) , irreversible neurocognitive decline report 11 % patient treated conventional WBRT , although study utilized daily radiation dos ≥3 Gy per day longer common use 12 . The decline cognitive function assess mini mental status examination may take 3 year manifest 2 . Extensive research investigate method improve efficacy WBRT . This include increase radiation dose , hyperfractionated radiation schedule combine WBRT drug therapy 13-16 . Currently , standard WBRT radiation dose schedule 30 37.5 Gy 10 15 fraction . One promising approach improve local control survival combine WBRT stereotactic radiosurgery patient 1 4 metastasis 6 , 17 . An emerge strategy reduce toxicity WBRT administer surgery SRS alone patient limited brain metastasis 4 , 9 . Although result high risk brain relapse , recurrence salvage repeat SRS and/or WBRT . For majority patient brain metastasis require WBRT , little research focus improve therapeutic ratio WBRT reduce toxicity 18 . 1.2 Rationale selective target brain metastasis WBRT In general , radiation oncologist approach patient selectively target gross tumor plus margin microscopic extension setup uncertainty prescription dose administer low dose area subclinical risk 19 . This strategy extensively utilized brain , head neck , lung , gastrointestinal , breast , gynecologic , hematologic genitourinary tumor . In many center , half patient treat IMRT improve dose distribution increase efficacy and/or reduce toxicity . Despite critical physiological role play uninvolved brain , reason paradigm extend WBRT likely relate general poor prognosis patient brain metastasis median survival 4 month 20 . Selectively target brain metastasis require physician , physicist radiation therapist effort investment increase resource cost treatment patient population may unjustified unless improve dose distribution translates significant clinical benefit . In era accountable care , determine cost effectiveness IMRT vs. conventional WBRT necessary . The recent identification long-term survivor metastatic cancer treat effective local systemic therapy slowly change attitude 21-22 . There distinct subgroup patient brain metastasis reasonable prognosis . For instance RTOG recursive partitioning analysis ( RPA ) group 1 patient median survival 7 month 20 . Patients single brain metastasis undergo surgery follow WBRT median survival 10 month 4 . A recent study Japan classify RTOG RPA class II Class IIa , IIb IIc base presence favorable factor include performance status , number brain tumor , primary tumor control active extracranial metastasis 23 . Survival patient RPA class IIa , IIb IIc 16 20 month , 8 month 4 5 month respectively long-term survivor subgroup . There preliminary effort apply IMRT improve whole brain radiation . This concept first propose Kao , et al 2005 24 . Two avenue research propose . One approach selectively spare part brain critical neurocognitive function , hippocampal stem cell subgranular zone 25 . This approach extensively test investigator University Wisconsin . The risk brain metastasis hippocampal avoidance zone le 5 % 26-27 . RTOG 0933 ongoing phase II trial test IMRT WBRT total dose 30 Gy 10 fraction limit mean hippocampal avoidance zone dose le 10 Gy 25 . The major criticism approach hippocampal avoidance zone one several region brain involved memory process retention 28 . Using RTOG 0933 technique , potentially functional brain tissue include limbic circuit neural stem cell region receive full prescription dose even clinically uninvolved metastasis . Pending study , approach remain experimental perform outside context control clinical trial . A second strategy selectively boost area gross disease simultaneously treat uninvolved brain standard radiation dose 24 . This strategy currently test country socialize health system United Kingdom Canada cost-effective alternative stereotactic radiosurgery boost . A published report England report feasibility treat gross tumor 40 Gy 10 fraction treat uninvolved brain 30 Gy 10 fraction 29 . A third application whole brain radiation selective sparing scalp 30 . The clinical target whole brain unintended radiation scalp result temporary permanent alopecia . Due dose distribution conventional WBRT , vertex scalp receive particularly high dose . Preliminary work suggest IMRT limit mean scalp dose 16 18 Gy reduce dos may shorten duration temporary alopecia possibly reduce risk permanent alopecia 30-32 . A final strategy yet explore . Rather increase dose radiation identify brain tumor , reduce dose uninvolved brain reduce acute long term side effect . In set prophylactic WBRT small cell non-small cell lung cancer , low radiation dose 25 30 Gy 10 15 fraction consider standard treatment 33-35 . In randomized trial prophylactic cranial irradiation small cell lung cancer , evidence improve disease control 36 Gy vs. 25 Gy 34 . With exception single report demonstrate subtle effect neurocognitive function assess Hopkins Verbal Learning Test , little evidence WBRT 25 30 Gy 10 15 fraction result neurocognitive decline prophylactic WBRT vs. observation multiple randomize controlled trial 35-36 . Higher dos WBRT show reduce verbal memory function 37 . Additionally , robust data randomize trial reproducibly demonstrate significant reduction incidence subsequent brain metastasis region brain dominant mass appreciable MRI prior treatment 33 , 35 , 38 . A theoretical disadvantage limit WBRT 30 Gy 15 fraction dose may inadequate prevent relapse relatively radioresistant tumor . However , discuss earlier , investigator administer 0 Gy uninvolved site defer WBRT due concern toxicity 11 . 1.3 Feasibility Selective Avoidance Uninvolved Brain Scalp IMRT Based body publish evidence , start utilize IMRT select patient brain metastasis June 2012 . Our plan objective deliver 37.5 Gy 15 fraction gross tumor ( ) + 5 mm margin limit radiation dose 30 Gy . A secondary goal limit mean scalp dose 16 18 Gy . No effort make achieve additional sparing hippocampal stem cell since definitive data demonstrate benefit yet publish . Based feasibility promise preliminary experience , propose prospective randomize trial determine whether significant benefit WBRT deliver via IMRT . 1.4 Neurocognitive Function Quality Life Assessment Although extensive sensitive neurocognitive test Hopkins Verbal Learning Test available , context resource available high-quality community hospital program , limit neurocognitive function assessment serial mini-mental status examination . Mini-mental status examination ( MMSE ) widely use global mental status measure medical setting require less 10 minute complete . This assessment tool extensively validate nearly 2,000 patient brain tumor treat RTOG protocols 39 . Quality life assess use EORTC QLQ - BN20 , extensively validate one page patient-reported survey 20 question . The EORTC-QLQ-BN20 design use patient undergo chemotherapy radiotherapy , compose 20 question assess visual disorder , motor dysfunction , communication deficit , various disease symptom ( eg , headache seizure ) , treatment toxicity ( eg , hair loss ) , future uncertainty . The EORTC QLQ - BN20 robust psychometric property result rigorous testing , development , external validity 40 . Within 2 week prior WBRT , patient undergo baseline quality life assessment . After completion WBRT , patient undergo quality life assessment every 3 month 6 month every 4 month whole brain radiotherapy . Quality life assessment score blind reviewer avoid potential bias . 1.5 Summary In summary , preclinical clinical evidence suggest radiation dose receive uninvolved portion brain WBRT play critical role cause radiation-induced alopecia neurocognitive decline without improve survival . Extensive data randomize trial suggest benefit reduce brain relapse elective treatment uninvolved brain . Although approach pursue , reduce radiation dose level utilize prophylactic cranial irradiation attractive alternative conventional WBRT non-specifically irradiate entire brain eliminate WBRT entirely . We hypothesize IMRT-WBRT reduce incidence duration alopecia reduce incidence neurocognitive deficit acceptable level observe prophylactic cranial irradiation .</detailed_description>
