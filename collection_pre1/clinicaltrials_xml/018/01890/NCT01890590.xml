	<brief_summary>CyberKnife Based Radiosurgery way deliver large dos radiation accurately tumor . The ability technology minimize radiation dose organ adjacent target tumor allow high dose deliver tumor , thus potentially increase efficacy radiation treatment . Currently , radiosurgery commonly use brain metastasis , Stage I lung cancer , spine tumor , localized prostate cancer . The purpose protocol evaluate role Radiosurgery treatment clinically localize primary renal cell carcinoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Before research start ( screen ) Many test procedure likely part regular cancer care may do even turn take part research study . If test procedure recently , may may repeat . - A medical history , include question health , current medication , allergy . - Performance status , evaluate able carry usual activity . - Quality life survey . - Gold seed ( Fiducial ) Placement : Placement least one ( usually 3 ) gold fiducial ( ) must place around tumor surgeon interventional radiologist minimum one week prior pre-treatment planning simulation . - An assessment tumor X-ray , CT ( Computerized Tomography ) scan , MRI ( Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) PET ( Positron Emission Tomography ) scan . - Blood test . - Urine test . - You undergo simulation intervention procedure . It involve study team help position study procedure undergo CT scan abdomen hold correct position . If test show eligible participate research study , begin study treatment . If meet eligibility criterion , able participate research study . After screen procedure confirm eligible participate research study : You receive series Cyberknife Radiosurgery treatment , amount radiation dose adjust size tumor . The treatment ideally take place course 3-4 day , 14 day overall . You position stable position lay back , capable reproducibility position allow move simulation treatment , allow feel comfortable possible . A variety system may utilize keep still ; include vacuum bag , alpha cradle , stereotactic frame surround three side large rigid pillow conform body . After final dosing We would like keep track medical condition rest life . We would like call telephone year see . Keeping touch checking condition every year help u look long-term effect research study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participants must meet follow criterion screen examination eligible participate study : Participants must histologically radiological evidence Stage I ( T1N0M0 ) renal cell carcinoma size large 8 cm great dimension measure MRI CT Scan At least one ( usually 3 ) gold fiducial place around tumor , perform day sign research inform consent . No irreversible coagulopathies Age ≥ 18 year old dosing adverse event data currently available use Cyberknife Radiosurgery radiation participant &lt; 18 year age , child exclude study eligible future pediatric Phase II trial . ECOG Performance Status ≤2 ( Appendix A ) . At least 12 month life expectancy Ability CT and/or MRI image without contrast must perform within 120 day prior registration . No cancer previous 2 year exception noninvasive skin cancer All subject meet eligibility criterion irrespective gender , minority underrepresented status eligible enrollment study . The effect Cyberknife Radiosurgery develop human fetus unknown . For reason Radiation know teratogenic , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document study specific consent form prior study entry . Labs : Serum Creatinin &lt; 3 mg/dl , Urinalysis , INR &lt; 2 , PTT &lt; 70 sec , AST , ALT ≤2.5x ULN , Abnormalities urinalysis ( i.e . proteinuria ) exclude patient participation study . Participants exhibit follow condition screen eligible admission study . Irreversible coagulopathies preclude fiducial placement Prior upper abdominal external beam irradiation Prior history invasive malignancy within last 2 year Inability deliver target dose CyberKnife due inability image fiducials Inability deliver target dose CyberKnife due normal tissue dose constraint Inability contrast CT MRI help define tumor volume radiation planning Decreased platelet count / anticoagulation parameter would preclude transcutaneous placement fiducials</criteria>
