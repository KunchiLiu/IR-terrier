	<brief_summary>Patients locally advanced metastatic ( i.e. , already metastases diagnosed tumor body outside primary lesion ) soft tissue sarcoma recruit study . The minimum age enter study 60 year . Therapy doxorubicin mainstay palliative chemotherapy patient , associate hematological toxicity increase infection rate . Pazopanib know rarely induce hematological toxicity trigger infection . We therefore assume pazopanib exerts similar activity decrease neutropenia neutropenic fever . Pazopanib already approve U.S. Europe treatment advance soft tissue sarcoma . Doxorubicin pazopanib randomly allocate either receive doxorubicin pazopanib phase II clinical trial . The aim study measure treatment effect ( reduction tumor size tumor stabilization ) drug , well survival rate , duration tumor control different therapy . A objective measure quality life standardize questionnaire throughout course treatment .</brief_summary>
