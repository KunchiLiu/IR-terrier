	<brief_summary>We hypothesize number need endoscopic procedure perform IBD patient ( adult child ) , reduce use individualized algorithm symptom , blood faecal biomarkers . The aim study reduce number endoscopy , procedure uncomfortable patient , time consume expensive . Through indirect test - blood test , fecal inflammation marker clinical symptom - compare endoscopic finding , want construct algorithm intestinal healing foreseen without perform endoscopy . Furthermore , correlate FC , blood test , clinical symptom score endoscopic score , histo-pathological inflammation score intestinal biopsy immunological score depict TNF- alpha IL17A level intestinal tissue , order ass gold standard - endoscopic remission .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Deep remission : The treatment goal patiens IBD achieve deep remission drug withdrawal avoid relapse . In order evaluate healing mucosa , currently necessary carry endoscopy , despite additional information provide FC blood sample . The endoscopic procedure uncomfortable patient , time consume expensive . We therefore seek , basis exist knowledge use correlation FC , blood test clinical remission endoscopic finding , establish non-invasive biomarkers might express deep remission . In long run , threshold level use indicator perform endoscopy , hopefully , reduce need perform . We compare result child adult likely exist difference respective FC level . Histopathologic remission : Biopsies intestinal tissue evaluate histopathologically indicate level microscopic inflammation ass acute chronic inflammatory sign cellular level , e.g . alter glandular structure , crypt abscess ulceration . By use Karl Geboes grade system , microscopic histopathological deep remission assess . We explore endoscopic 'gold standard ' compare endoscopic remission histopathological remission . Immunological remission : In general , tissue factor link various immunological pathway belong innate , adaptive regulatory immune response , comprise pro-inflammatory anti-inflammatory response . This include molecule cytokine , chemokines , adhesion molecule correspond cellular soluble receptor . Tumor-necrosis-factor ( TNF ) -alpha interleukin 17A two several molecule pro-inflammatory process strongly associate grade inflammation IBD ( Florholmen Fries 2011 ) . Olsen et al . 2009 report normalization mucosal TNF-alpha ulcerative colitis patient represent endoscopically heal mucosa . In addition clinical index , endoscopic histological criterion , also introduce molecular base Immunological Remission . A work hypothesis immunological remission state normalization pro-inflammatory anti-inflammatory process mucosa . The concept immunological remission potential clinical impact still early phase evaluation , obtain practical application non-invasive test , one base stool sample , must develop . In current project , immunological remission part study , endoscopic histopathology remission , correlation FC , blood test clinical remission .</detailed_description>
