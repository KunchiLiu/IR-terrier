	<brief_summary>Background : - Cord blood blood take umbilical cord placenta healthy newborn childbirth . The cord blood collect baby call cord blood unit . Cord blood unit store frozen public cord blood bank . About 10,000 cord blood transplant perform child adult blood cancer diseases world . These transplant help save life improve treatment . However , available unit cord blood collect , store , license accord specific government requirement . These unlicensed unit still use transplant , give part specific research study . This study evaluate safety give unlicensed unit record problem may occur give cord blood . Objectives : - To test safety effectiveness unlicensed cord blood unit people need stem cell transplant . Eligibility : - Individuals schedule stem cell transplant . Design : - Participants screen medical history physical exam . - Participants receive cord blood unit part stem cell transplant procedure . The transplant perform accord current standard care procedure . - After transplant , participant monitor 1 year . Any problem side effect transplant treat necessary . All outcomes report National Cord Blood Program Center International Blood Marrow Transplant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background - The requirement licensure human cell blood product become part FDA final rule Human Cells , Tissues , Tissue-Based Products ( HCT/Ps ) ( March 29 , 2004 May 25 , 2005 ) effort prevent transmission communicable disease , minimize contamination preserve integrity function processing , outline safety effectiveness requirement cell unrelated donor HCT/Ps minimally manipulate , assure label clear accurate misleading monitor communicate industry via establishment registration . As October 20 , 2011 , unit cord blood meet manufacturing requirement licensure distribute transplantation transplant occur IND research protocol . In addition licensure guidance , FDA publish guidance August 2011 title Investigational New Drug Applications ( INDs ) Minimally Manipulated , Unrelated Allogeneic Placental/Umbilical Cord Blood Intended Hematopoietic Reconstitution Specified Indications . - This multi-center study unlicensed , investigational cryopreserved cord blood unit ( CBUs ) manufacture National Cord Blood Program ( NCBP ) provide access distribution Investigational New Drug ( IND ) application # 6637 site locally IRB-approved protocol unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation pediatric adult patient . Objectives -The primary objective study examine safety administration unlicensed investigational NCBP HPC-CORD Blood product , evaluate prospectively incidence serious adverse reaction well incidence infusion relate reaction administration unlicensed , investigational NCBP CBU . Secondary Objectives : In patient receive non-licensed NCBP CBU ( HPC-CORD BLOOD ) : - Assess incidence transmission infection - Assess incidence graft rejection - Assess incidence neutrophil engraftment &gt; 500 /ul - Determine 1 year survival cord blood transplantation - Assess cumulative incidence acute graft vs. host disease ( GVHD ) grade II IV grade III IV - Assess cumulative incidence chronic GVHD - Determine platelet engraftment &gt; 20,000/ul &gt; 50,000/ul - Determine CBU-derived engraftment Eligibility Criteria Inclusion Criteria - Patients age either gender indication receipt investigational HPC-CORD BLOOD participate NIH-IRB approve clinical trial unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . - Signed informed consent ( assent applicable ) . Exclusion Criteria - Patients receive license CB product ( ) - Patients receive unlicensed CB product CB bank ( i.e . NMDP ) Design This study multi-NIH institute endeavor design allow NHLBI , NCI NIAID investigator access investigational HPC-CORD BLOOD patient participate NIH-IRB approve clinical trial unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation . Treatment , include pre-treatment conditioning GVHD prophylaxis occur per institute NIH-IRB approve clinical trial transplant center specification .</detailed_description>
