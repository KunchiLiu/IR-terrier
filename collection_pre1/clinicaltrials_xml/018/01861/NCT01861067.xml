	<brief_summary>During last 2 decade , several study try define best surgical approach hysterectomy benign uterine diseases1 . Accumulating evidence demonstrate abdominal hysterectomy high incidence complication , long hospital stay slow convalescence comparison laparoscopic hysterectomy ( LH ) . The main advantage LHs absence wide abdominal scar , result few wound-related complication significant decrease postoperative pain . Technologic advance endoscopic instrumentation optic allow development even less invasive procedure conventional LH use multiple port : laparoendoscopic single-site ( LESS ) surgery , also know single-port access ( SPA ) laparoscopy3 . In LESS approach , total laparoscopic hysterectomy ( TLH ) laparoscopically-assisted vaginal hysterectomy ( LAVH ) feasible , comparable conventional LH . However , yet determine two alternative less invasive approach ( LESS-TLH LESS-LAVH ) prefer . In particular , none focus postoperative pain primary outcome study . The investigator therefore design randomized trial investigate specifically differences postoperative pain LESS-TLH LESS-LAVH .</brief_summary>
