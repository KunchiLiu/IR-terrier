	<brief_summary>Uterine myoma ( fibroids leiomyoma ) common benign tumor female genital tract lead indication hysterectomy . Although hysterectomy definitive treatment myoma , myomectomy remain gold standard treatment woman desire future fertility uterine conservation3 . However , bleed often problem myomectomy result intraoperative hypovolemic shock , postoperative anemia , pelvic infection , adhesion infertility . A number intervention introduce reduce hemorrhage myomectomy . Two category intervention identify : ( ) Vascular intervention uterine and/or ovarian artery artery clamping , tie , embolization ; ( b ) pharmacologic intervention vasopressin , epinephrine , oxytocin , ergometrine , misoprostol , sulprostone , gonadotropin-releasing hormone ( GnRH ) agonist4-11 . Of , intraoperative local injection vasopressin cause vasospasm commonly use . However , wide consensus use agent serious side effect report literature . In addition , several country , include France Italy , vasopressin commercialize potential adverse effect cardiovascular system . Epinephrine also induce vasoconstrictive effect tissue last long vasopressin ( 5-6 hour versus 7-35 minute ) use various gynecological surgery , endoscopic resection , dermatologic procedure reduce blood loss . However , study use epinephrine reduce hemorrhage myomectomy . Furthermore , randomize comparison epinephrine vasopressin hemostatic agent myomectomy never conduct . To test hypothesis injection epinephrine vasopressin myomectomy equivalent reduce blood loss , investigator perform randomize control study .</brief_summary>
