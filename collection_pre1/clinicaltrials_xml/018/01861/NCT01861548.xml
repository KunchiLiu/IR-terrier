	<detailed_description>The Polish Mother Child Cohort multicentre prospective study different exposure . Prospective cohort study design enable identification exposure may influence pregnancy outcome chil-dren 's health , verification exposure biomarker measurement notification change exposure level . The aim study evaluate impact exposure different environmental factor pregnancy birth pregnancy outcome child 's health . Specific research hypotheses refer role heavy metal , exposure polycyclic aromatic hydrocar-bons ( PAHs ) environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS ) aetiology intrauterine growth retardation ( IUGR ) , preterm delivery ( PD ) risk respiratory disease , allergy poor mental physical development . It also intend explain role oxidative stress nutritional status pregnant woman . The impact occupational exposure stressful situation pregnancy outcome evaluate question-naire data . The result study help determine level child prenatal postnatal exposure several area Poland im-pact course outcome pregnancy child 's health . This protocol concern child followed-up birth age 2 year deter-mine long term effect pre- postnatal environmental exposure . Exposure child ETS . Postnatal child exposure ETS 12 , 24 month birth assess . From child urine sample saliva sample mother declare smoke abstinence collect . The saliva urine cotinine level analyse use high performance liquid chromatography couple tandem mass spectrometry/positive electrospray ionization ( LC-ESI+MS/MS ) isotope dilution . Exposure child PAH . The HPLC technique use analysis level 1-hydroksypyrene urine biomarker PAH exposure ( 12 24 month ) . Exposure lead , cadmium , mercury child . Blood hair collect 100 child . Total inorganic mercury analyze use cold vapour atomic fluorescence spectrophotometry . The lead cadmium concentration blood determine graphite-furnance atomic-absorption spectrometry . Exposure indoor allergen , endotoxin glucans . The analyzis cover approx . 50 family home child . The settled dust collect floor leave room child bed ( mattress blanket ) . To determine allergens concentration dust sample , commercially available enzymelinked immunosorbent assey ( ELISA ) kit ispplied accord protocol.To determine endotoxin ( 1→3 ) -β-D-glucans concentration LAL test apply . The questionnaire study perform among parent order obtain data demographic factor home condition . Questionnaires conduct mother 12 , 24 month delivery . Mothers child interview . The questionnaire investigate child 's health development , nutrition small child contact child . The smoking status parent potential source child 's ETS exposure identify . Information proximity heavy traffic inquire . Additionally information closet his/her place live air pollution monitoring station collect . Exposure environmental factor include domestic animal , home dust , household cleaning agent indoor use pesticide evaluate questionnaire . Determination prevalence upper low respiratory tract infection , middle ear disease allergy among child . The incidence upper low respiratory tract infection , middle ear disease symptoms allergy among child identify base detailed interview mother 12 24 month child birth . This interview conduct paediatrician . For child upper low respiratory tract infection ( tonsillitis , laryngitis , bronchitis pneumonia ) , well middle ear disease allergy food inhalant allergen identify base review medical chart . The duration infection disease , medication take hospitalization identify . The current health status chide child ' anthropometry ( high , weight ) preform pediatrician . Determination neurodevelopment child . BSID-III use assessment child neurodevelopment . The test schedule 12 and/ 24 month live conduct psychologist child development specialist . The test assess five developmental area child : cognitive , motor ( fine gross motor ) , language ( receptive , expressive ) , social-emotional adaptive behavior .</detailed_description>
