	<brief_summary>Enuresis ( E ) bedwetting common pediatric complaint , recent research discover link obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) . In child , OSA often secondary enlargement adenoid tonsil , often successfully treat steroid solution give nose . The relationship SDB E incompletely understand . Airway obstruction affect quality sleep , child wake oxygen level drop . Abnormal sleep also decrease secretion hormone affect kidney 's ability concentrate urine night , result much urine bladder . Contemporary evidence also suggest patient enuresis abnormal sleep phase , may impair communication inhibition bladder . In previous study , investigator demonstrate child E high likelihood concomitant SDB . The investigator also demonstrate child E symptom SDB respond typical management bedwetting . Therefore , investigator propose treat patient present E standard treatment E ( bed alarm ) first line therapy SDB : Intranasal steroid . This medication help decrease inflammation adenoid tonsil , thereby reduce airway obstruction . investigator hypothesize child significant symptom SDB improve addition INS , investigator hope see improvement bedwetting , quality life , sleep quality well . To test , patent E recruit pediatric urology clinic . They offer standard treatment E , bed alarm , treatment group give intranasal steroid spray . The investigator reassess patient 3 month treatment , compare two group .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intranasal Steroids Treatment Nocturnal Enuresis With Associated Obstructive Sleep Apnea</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Enuresis ( E ) common pediatric urological complaint . Up 15 % 5-year old child 5 % 10-year old child affect . Despite prevalence , E often ineffectively manage . Current treatment modality include behavior modification , alarm therapy , pharmacologic treatment . Recently , significant amount contemporary research focus sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB ) relation E. This term encompass variety disorder characterize abnormality respiratory pattern quantity ventilation sleep . Often symptoms OSA child may insidious nature , include behavioural problem , hyperactivity , poor school performance , failure thrive enuresis . The relationship E OSA recently question . Cinar et al . demonstrate 63 % complete resolution 4 % partial resolution E post surgical treatment upper airway obstruction . Basha et al . similar result , 61.4 % patient total resolution NE . The investigator previously publish result incidence SDB enuretic population . Using OSA-18 PSQ-22 screening tool symptom SDB , investigator find significant proportion patient enuresis SDB risk magnify patient abnormal daytime voiding . The pathophysiology relationship currently review . With cystometrography , Brooks et al . demonstrated increase bladder pressure 5 60 cm H2O increase respiratory effort . Mahler et al . demonstrate healthy child expose sleep deprivation , disruption circadian rhythm result 68 % increase urine volume , significant increase sodium excretion , clearance , fractional excretion . Sleep deprivation also result high nighttime blood pressure , heart rate , affect sodium regulating hormone , include renin-angiotension-aldosterone system ANP . Apneic episodes result similar fluctuation sodium excretion , cause increase intrathoracic pressure , increase stretch cardiomyocytes , excretion atrial brain natriuretic peptide . Finally , overall disruption sleep due SDB may ultimate factor . Healthy child sleep deprivation demonstrate increased naturiesis , Yeung et al . demonstration child E abnormal sleep EEG activity impaired arousability , increase light non-REM sleep , frequent cortical arousal , impair wakening . Enuresis difficult treat , conventional modality rarely achieve success rate great 65 % . According several systematic review , enuresis alarm high efficacy rate , result increase number dry night per week 4 . In study Monda et al. , 66 % child use enuresis alarm achieve continence 6 month . Alarms may also reduce treatment failure relapse often associate use medication tricyclic antidepressant . Enuresis alarm use moisture sensor activate soon child begin void . In child , SDB primarily cause adenotonsillar hypertrophy , treatment OSA begin three-month trial intranasal steroid ( INS ) . INS act directly reduce adenoidal size lympholytic action , reduce inflammation , decrease significance adenoid reservoir infection . In recent meta-analysis , INS find reduce symptom snore , mouth breathing , nasal speech 45-50 % compare placebo . Similarly , Demirhan et al . show mean decrease adenoid/choana ratio 86.9 % 56.2 % 8 week fluticasone . In recent meta-analysis , Zhang et al . find 5/6 trial show significant improvement nasal obstruction symptom reduction adenoid size use INS . The investigator ' previous data show child symptom SDB E respond conventional management E. The investigator therefore propose trial novel management approach , treat symptom SDB intranasal steroid , hop improve patient 's enuresis .</detailed_description>
