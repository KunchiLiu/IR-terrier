	<brief_summary>This pilot `` window opportunity '' clinical study patient operable breast cancer investigate use reparixin single agent time period clinical diagnosis surgery . This study evaluate effect orally administer reparixin CSCs primary tumor tumoral microenvironment early breast cancer population . The aim investigate cancer stem cell ( CSCs ) pathway marker decrease two early breast cancer subgroup ( ER+ and/or progesterone receptor positive/HER-2- ER negative/progesterone receptor negative/HER‑2- ) compare difference two subgroup try good identify target population . 20 patient enrol subgroup ten site US .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>According cancer stem cell ( CSC ) model , tumor organize cellular hierarchy maintain subpopulation cell display stem cell property . These property include self-renewal ( drive tumorigenesis ) differentiation ( generate tumor bulk contribute cellular heterogeneity ) . CSCs first observe hematological malignancy also identify solid tumor breast , prostate , brain , colon pancreas . CSCs think resistant conventional chemotherapy may relapse occurs many patient might explain failure develop therapy consistently able eradicate solid tumor . Although currently available drug shrink metastatic tumor , effect usually transient often appreciably extend life patient . One reason failure treatment acquisition drug resistance cancer cell evolve ; another possibility exist therapy fail kill CSCs effectively . Existing therapy develop largely bulk population tumor cell often identify ability shrink tumor . Because cancer cell limit proliferative potential , ability shrink tumor mainly reflect ability kill cell . It seem normal stem cell various tissue tend resistant chemotherapeutics mature cell type tissue . The reason clear , may relate high level expression anti-apoptotic protein adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter multidrug resistance gene . If true CSCs , one would predict cell would resistant chemotherapeutics tumor cell limit proliferative potential . Even therapy cause complete regression tumor might spare enough CSCs allow re-growth tumor . Therapies specifically direct CSCs might result much durable response even cure metastatic tumor . There limited data impact treatment tailor base CSC detection . Gene profile CSCs could lead identification therapeutic target CSCs ( e.g . hormone receptor ( HR ) , human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 [ HER-2 ] expression , epidermal growth factor receptor [ EGFR ] expression ) , could represent tumor biopsy `` real time '' . Several group show frequent discordance HER-2 status primary tumor CSCs , case report show clinical utility use trastuzumab-based therapy base HER-2 CSCs status . Similarly , hormonal status CSCs could different primary tumor , could lead increase number patient suitable endocrine therapy , also could explain endocrine therapy fail subset HR positive ( HR+ ) patient . More specifically , recent observation Ginestier et al . demonstrate expression chemokine receptor 1 ( CXCR-1 ) associate aldehyde dehydrogenase positive ( ALDH+ ) cell . In breast carcinoma , ALDEFLUOR+ phenotype show partial overlap CD44+CD24-Lin-CSC phenotype . Cellular hierarchy identify series molecularly characterize breast cancer cell line demonstrate line contain ALDEFLUOR+ component tumorigenic metastatic NOD/SCID mouse . Furthermore , previous observation demonstrate addition recombinant interleukin-8 ( IL-8 ) increase CSC population well increase propensity invasion . Moreover , tissue damage induce chemotherapeutic agent may induce IL-8 part injury response . This suggest strategy aim interfere IL 8/CXCR-1 axis may able target CSCs , increase efficacy current therapy . This experimental data provide another therapeutic target breast cancer . Reparixin seem good candidate use breast cancer patient acceptable toxicity profile show Phase I II clinical trial conduct far , along observed activity vitro breast cancer cell line vivo tumor xenograft mouse . A phase 1 study currently underway study effect reparixin combination paclitaxel metastatic breast cancer . This small pilot study aim explore effect breast CSC marker well safety PK profile orally administer single agent reparixin HER-2 negative ( HER 2- ) early breast cancer patient 3 week prior surgery . The study perform interval disease diagnosis plan surgery may lead minimal delay surgery . This balance potential benefit study evaluate CSCs prognostic importance well obtain information impact reparixin therapy .</detailed_description>
