	<brief_summary>Restless legs syndrome ( RLS ) debilitate sleep disorder significant impact quality life , often time difficult diagnose treat effectively . RLS typically treat medical therapy ( include dopaminergic agent , dopamine agonist , benzodiazepine , anticonvulsant , opiate , among therapy ) . Many patient either refractory medical therapy , contraindication adverse reaction available medical therapy , desire conservative non-medication base therapy . Two previous study demonstrate pneumatic compression device place legs improve symptom RLS . We would like ass whether Venous Health Systems Vasculaire leg compression device improve symptom quality life measure relate RLS 40 patient evaluate prospectively one month . This pilot study assess subjective response cohort patient device prospectively . Our hypothesis 66 % cohort demonstrate positive symptomatic response base RLS specific quality life questionnaire .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vasculaire Leg Compression Device Treatment Restless Legs Syndrome - A Prospective Clinical Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : Restless Leg Syndrome ( RLS ) affect nearly 12 million Americans . Although precise etiology RLS well characterize , specific diagnostic criterion . Symptoms typically bad evening , consist strong urge move affect limb ( ) relief movement . Current medical therapy pose several challenge many patient , side effect include extreme drowsiness , hallucination , nausea , headache insomnia . An alternative , non-medical therapy may provide suitable option subset patient . Intermittent pneumatic compression device previously study population , demonstrate effectiveness . However prior model require subject remain immobile use , represent significant limitation give immobility may actually promote worsen symptom . An effective , alternative non-pharmacologic therapy interfere patient mobility provide valuable treatment option . The purpose study ass whether Vasculaire Intermittent Pneumatic Compression System improve validated measure symptom relief , patient satisfaction , quality life RLS . This pilot study determine whether Vasculaire device improves validate measure symptom relief , patient satisfaction , quality life RLS patient . Depending outcome study hope develop sham-controlled clinical trial follow-up study . METHODS : We perform Prospective cohort study . We recruit patient reach N=40 . After informed consent , patient 's record review ensure serum iron panel ferritin check within precede 6 month . For patient miss laboratory study , blood drawn full serum iron panel ( serum iron level , serum ferritin , total iron bind capacity ) , per standard care ( exclude iron deficiency cause contributor symptom ) . Patients inadequate serum iron store exclude . Patients adequate iron store ask complete comprehensive medical questionnaire document medical condition medication dos prescribe . This questionnaire also record previously try therapy , home remedy medically prescribed treatment . Specific undesirable side effect also document . Severity determine base 5 previously validate questionnaire instrument ( The Restless Legs Syndrome Rating Scale , The Restless Legs Syndrome-Quality Life Instrument ( RLS-QLI ) , The Epworth Sleepiness Scale ( ESS ) , The Johns Hopkins Restless Legs Severity Scale ( JHRLS ) , The International Restless Legs Syndrome Rating Scale ) . Once medical history review , documentation severity assess determination unresolved treatment post medical therapy , patient eligible enrollment . The Vasculaire Intermittent Pneumatic Compression System introduce patient instruction provide optimize use device accordance study protocol .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Individuals least 18 year age reliable diagnosis RLS accordance International Classification Sleep Disorder , Revised Diagnostic Coding Manual American Academy Sleep Medicine . All patient include must persistent symptom interfere quality life . Patients currently approve medical therapy RLS must stable dose/agent ≥30 day experience persistent symptom interfere quality life . Patients currently refractory medical therapy may also include presently care physician receive medical therapy RLS ≥30 day without improvement and/or experience unacceptable side effect . Pregnancy status assess relevant device use . Younger 18 year , unstable medical condition may interfere requirement study , e.g . diabetes mellitus , symptomatic asthma , congestive heart failure nocturnal symptom , mental physical limitation ( include dementia ) would preclude data collection questionnaire wear intermittent pneumatic compression device . Other medical condition would serve exclusion criterion increase venous lymphatic return undesirable . These specific condition know suspected deep vein thrombosis , thrombophlebitis , severe congestive heart failure , pulmonary edema , severe arteriosclerosis , action infection gangrene , recent vein ligation skin graft , extreme deformity leg . Patients iron deficiency anemia , evidence inadequate serum iron store laboratory test also exclude correct .</criteria>
