	<brief_summary>We interest develop new good way diagnose cause low respiratory tract infection include pneumonia . Currently find causal bug ( bacteria virus ) less 50 % patient pneumonia . A potential way well find bug responsible may include check bug nose nasal wash swab . Better diagnostics would allow target antibiotic therapy future technique may use way check efficiency new vaccine . We recruit patient respiratory infection also 'control ' group patient admit hospital respiratory infection . We need access medical history information make sure eligible suitable study . If participate study , important study doctor continue access personal Investigator Designation Contact telephone Dr Andrea Collins PhD student/research SpR xxxxxxxxxxxxx Carole Hancock Research nurse 0151 706 4856 Prof Stephen Gordon Principle Investigator 0151 705 3169 NW PIL V1.3 : October 2012 REC ref : 12/NW/0713 information follow properly contact study need . Patients group nasal wash ( swab ) , blood ( 30mls = 6 teaspoon ) urine take day recruitment nasal wash ( swab ) blood ( 30mls = 6 teaspoon ) take 6 week later ( likely out-patient Royal Liverpool , extreme circumstance occur patient 's home ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pneumococcal Carriage Patients With Lower Respiratory Tract Infection ( LRTI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN OVERVIEW Overall research aim To analyse pneumococcal carriage rate patient hospitalise LRTI . Primary endpoint Rate pneumococcal carriage patient hospitalise LRTI age match control . Secondary endpoint 1 . Density pneumococcal carriage patient hospitalise LRTI age match control 2 . Alterations T cell function ( Th1 , Th17 , T regs ) LRTI patient age match control ( versus young adult part exist 'P4 ' study ) . Study design Patients hospitalise LRTI November 2012 April 2014 approach within 72 hour admission . Patients recruit study consist hospitalise LRTI control group age match patient ( within +/- 10 year ) hospitalise reason respiratory infection .</detailed_description>
