	<brief_summary>The investigator seek perform observational study patient brain metastasis undergo whole brain radiation therapy ( WBRT ) stereotactic radiosurgery ( SRS ) treatment order quantify baseline neurocognitive change may result intracranial disease burden , radiation treatment ( WBRT SRS ) , . To , investigator compare match control subject patient time point obtain radiation treatment either SRS WBRT . Pre-treatment evaluation include neurocognitive test assessment fMRI task-related activation pattern rest state brain activity . Four twelve month post-treatment neuropsychological evaluation perform pre- 4-month post-treatment fMRI scan obtain order evaluate change neurocognitive function focus short-term memory executive function domain . A brief quality life assessment also complete study time point . In order plan treatment strategies future important accurately document effect intracranial disease burden well radiation treatment neurocognitive functioning , validate fMRI activation task short term memory executive functioning , quantify activation volume would potentially spar future `` cognitive sparing '' protocol . The investigator hypothesize first amount location intracranial disease burden represent pre-treatment variable affect NCF . The compromised NCF visualize rest state task-oriented neurocognitive exercise . The investigator anticipate perturbation rest state cause intracranial disease burden reflect patient compare matched control . The investigator hypothesize additionally cancer patient brain metastasis undergo radiation treatment improve intracranial disease control expense executive memory function difference patient undergo stereotactic radiosurgery whole brain radiation alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This research protocol design perform neuropsychological test fMRI scan patient brain metastasis undergo either WBRT SRS treatment Thomas Jefferson University Hospital . Eligible patient refer department Neurosurgery Radiation-oncology . The patient complete informed consent pre- post-treatment ( 4 month WBRT SRS complete ) fMRI scan pre- post-treatment ( 4 12 month WBRT SRS complete ) neuropsychological testing session tell participation either fMRI scan neuropsychological test voluntary . Patients also tell data collect observational research purpose directly affect clinical care . Patients insurer additionally bill consequence study aside clinical billing consistent current clinical practice . The fMRI study add pre-existing treatment planning follow MRI scan would obtain clinical necessity without study . In order able identify distinguish normal versus abnormal brain activity pattern associate various fMRI task rest state imaging procedure part study , necessary scan subset healthy ( age , education , gender match ) normal control various cognitive behavioral task . This way determine validity task use term activation property normal brain area involve task . Specifically , healthy age match control critical study way validate fMRI finding hippocampal executive function activation task . Normal match control need proper analysis neurocognitive neuroimaging data . For neurocognitive data , normal control data need construct Reliable Change Index ( RCI ) reference Statistics Section . Also , comparison normal important estimate magnitude change observe patient , determine clinical relevance . For neuroimaging data , normal control need provide reference comparison point quantify degree brain-imaging map ( referred Statistical Parametric Map , SPM ) point time ( baseline , post-treatment ) deviate normal . By compare patient group normal , fMRI activation relate ancillary idiosyncratic factor scan cancel , leave activation directly relate cognitive task . Also , determine presence new , atypical brain activation site , lose activation site , deactivation , achieve normal SPM brain map comparison . This apply equally task-driven fMRI rest state functional connectivity data . To analyze within-subject analysis neuroimaging data , examine neuroimaging data within-subject primary quantitative approach image data , within-subject comparison prone methodologic problem . There phenomenon know neuroimaging literature `` double dipping '' concern ability distinguish real versus random variation time . Double dip refers use test finding one point time constrain bias data outcome change register second point time . More concretely , difference see image data may reflect change error , artifactual activation , change true-task related activation . To avoid problem operationalize change compare patient 's image data index deviation healthy normal point time ( pre-surgery/baseline , post-surgery ) . This procedure provide systematic mean quantify compare typicality pre postsurgical neurocognitive activation network organization , procedure alleviates concern `` double dipping '' . This `` double dipping '' phenomenon remedy propose applies equally task-driven fMRI , rest state functional connectivity data , DTI data . In essence , methodology propose minimizes reliance random , session-specific fluctuation part reference comparison point determine change . Our method quantifies deviation patient normal , examine relative difference deviation index change . In , avoid use pre-treatment neuroimaging result template compare determine change , minimize concern double dip . There risk associate scanning procedure long metal body . The study normal volunteer also allow determination stability activation finding time ; allow verification reliability fMRI task procedure time . Without understand potential normal change occur brain activation structure time , impossible determine pathologic change occur . This group normal subject study advance order validate fMRI task . Furthermore , normal control subject yoke link matched patient return additional scanning session time point match patient .</detailed_description>
