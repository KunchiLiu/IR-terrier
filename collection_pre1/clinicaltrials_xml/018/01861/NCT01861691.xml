	<brief_summary>The long-term result several large-scale prospective randomize trial compare laparoscopic-assisted open colectomy colon cancer publish past decade . The oncologic outcome nearly similar patient underwent laparoscopic open surgery . In Japan , Japan Clinical Oncology Group ( JCOG ) conduct randomized trial compare oncological outcome patient underwent laparoscopic open surgery advance colon cancer recto-sigmoid cancer . However , exclusion criterion concern tumor site transverse descend colon . The reason exclusion laparoscopic procedure difficult transverse descend colon cancer . However , laparoscopic surgery transverse descend colon cancer perform clinically . We conduct randomize trial compare laparoscopic surgery conventional open surgery transverse descend colon cancer . The purpose present study clarify safety feasibility laparoscopic surgery transverse descend colon cancer patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial Between Laparoscopic Open Surgery Transverse Descending Colon Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients - This randomize control trial conduct single institute , Yokohama City University Medical Center ( Japan ) . - 80 patient transverse colon descend colon cancer randomly allocate receive laparoscopic surgery conventional open surgery . Surgical procedure - All surgical procedure perform one specialized colorectal treatment team . The laparoscopic surgery perform surgeon pass skill accreditation system laparoscopic gastroenterological surgery establish Japanese Society Endoscopic Surgery ( JSES ) , open surgery perform supervision skillful surgeon . - All operation perform accord standard radical cure procedure describe seventh edition Japanese General Rules Clinical Pathological Studies Cancer Colon , Rectum Anus . That , intestinal excision lymph node dissection separate feed blood vessel origin perform surgical procedure . Patients underwent palliative partial excision include . - In laparoscopic surgery , medial-to-lateral approach perform patient . - In conventional open surgery , first procedure do lateral approach . The reconstruction technique use laparoscopic surgery . Randomization - To balance operative background laparoscopic conventional open surgery group , patient stratify tumor location ( transverse colon , descend colon ) . Adjuvant therapy - When pathological stage diagnose stage 3 histological examination resect specimen , adjuvant chemotherapy do oral fluoropyrimidine anti-cancer drug . - Neither radiation therapy preoperative chemotherapy give patient . Preoperative chemo-radiotherapy even rectal cancer yet standard treatment Japan . Assessment parameters - The preoperative parameter - Operative assessment parameter - Postoperative assessment parameter An early postoperative complication define complication occur finish operation postoperative day 30 . A late postoperative complication define complication occur postoperative day 30 . The terminology complication classify accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 , grade do Classification Surgical Complication . - The pathological result record accord 7th edition Japanese General Rules Clinical Pathological Studies Cancer Colon , Rectum Anus 7th edition primary tumor , regional node , metastasis ( TNM ) classification . Circumferential margin involvement define exposure cancer cell vertical dissection surface histological examination . - Quality life ( QOL ) score . The QOL score measure use 36-item Short Form Health Survey ( SF-36 ) version 2.0 . It tool measure health-related QOL ( HRQOL ) accord inclusive standard disease-specific standard . The SF-36 compose 36 question . The score express numerically provide score algorithm . SF-36 questionnaire send patient one month , 6 month one year surgery postal mail . A return envelope enclose SF-36 questionnaire , patient send back research secretariat postal mail . A questionnaire defecation situation wound pain besides SF-36 add three time . The question complete rehabilitation occur add questionnaire one year . Follow-up schedule - The follow-up schedule follow accord stage . Patients stag 0 I follow outpatient examination include tumor marker measurement , chest , abdominal pelvic compute tomography ( CT ) year five year . Patients stage 2 3a examine CT tumor marker measurement every six month first two year . These examination do year third year fifth year . Patients stage 3b 3c examine CT tumor marker measurement every four month first two year , every six month third year fifth year . Statistical analysis - The primary endpoint early complication rate . - The secondary endpoint 5-recurrence-free survival , 5-year overall survival , length postoperative hospital stay , HRQOL score . To evaluate whether difference operative procedure influence survival include death due another disease , comparison overall survival meaning . Early complication rate , length postoperative hospital stay HRQOL score add secondary endpoint parameter possibility become ground selection operation method difference overall survival recurrence-free survival . - A sample size 74 patient assure achieve power 70 % detect difference group use two-sided Chi-squared test type I error rate equal 0.2 , true complication rate 20 % 40 % laparoscopic open surgery , respectively . The dropout consider number accumulation target assume 80 patient . - For continuous variable , data present mean Â± standard deviation ( SD ) . For categorical variable , data present frequency percentage ( % ) . Comparison endpoint base intention-to-treat principle , , patient switch another group surgery treat member allocate group . The Chi-squared test apply evaluate significance difference proportion , t-test use evaluate significance difference continuous variable . A p-value le 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
