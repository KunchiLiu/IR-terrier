	<brief_summary>Liposomal formulation frequently use today treatment cancer . LiPlaCis first target liposomal formulation tumour trigger release mechanism undergo clinical development oncology expect LiPlaCis improve therapeutic index cisplatin compare conventional cisplatin . Cisplatin one widely use drug treatment cancer due document efficacy number tumour type . Furthermore , seem highly likely cisplatin remain important drug future treatment cancer . However , drug associate number serious toxicity complicate necessitates discontinuation therapy - e.g . need pre-hydration , neurotoxicity , nausea vomit . Thus , well-established need improve cisplatin therapy cancer patient . One option improve formulation drug , selective up-take cisplatin administer take place tumour site . Based result pre-clinical study LiPlaCis , seem clear LiPlaCis offer potential improve cisplatin therapy benefit cancer patient . In prematurely stopped Phase I Dutch study Recommended Dose ( RD ) Phase II study never reach aim Phase I dose escalate study . At RD level study , patient preferably advance breast cancer biopsy examination show pattern compatible sensitivity LiPlaCis</brief_summary>
