	<brief_summary>The tie radix inferior mesenteric artery ( IMA ) recognize radical cure technique rectal cancer surgery Japan . In one side , preserve leave colic artery ( LCA ) technique maintain blood flow proximal sigmoid colon perform practice . However , evidence show effectiveness technique . We conduct randomize trial compare high tie low tie IMA rectal anterior resection define appropriate portion IMA tying .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial Evaluate High Tie Versus Low Tie Inferior Mesenteric Artery Anterior Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients - This randomize control trial conduct single institute , Yokohama City University Medical Center ( Japan ) . - 300 patient underwent anterior resection rectal cancer randomly allocate receive high tie low tie inferior mesenteric artery . Surgical procedure - All surgical procedure perform one specialized colorectal treatment team . The laparoscopic surgery perform surgeon pass skill accreditation system laparoscopic gastroenterological surgery establish Japanese Society Endoscopic Surgery ( JSES ) , open surgery perform supervision skillful surgeon . - All operation perform accord standard radical cure procedure describe seventh edition Japanese General Rules Clinical Pathological Studies Cancer Colon , Rectum Anus . That , intestinal excision lymph node dissection around IMA origin perform surgical procedure . Patients underwent palliative partial excision include . - In high tie ( HT ) IMA , IMA separate origin abdominal aorta . - In low tie ( LT ) IMA , IMA separate branch leave colic artery . The lymph node dissection around IMA origin perform . Randomization - To balance operative background HT LT group , patient stratify approach surgery ( open laparoscopic surgery ) . Adjuvant therapy - When pathological stage diagnose stage 3 histological examination resect specimen , adjuvant chemotherapy do oral fluoropyrimidine anti-cancer drug . - Neither radiation therapy preoperative chemotherapy give patient . Preoperative chemo-radiotherapy even rectal cancer yet standard treatment Japan . Assessment parameters - The preoperative parameter - Operative assessment parameter - Postoperative assessment parameter An early postoperative complication define complication occur finish operation postoperative day 30 . A late postoperative complication define complication occur postoperative day 30 . The terminology complication classify accord Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 4.0 , grade do Classification Surgical Complication . - The pathological result record accord 7th edition Japanese General Rules Clinical Pathological Studies Cancer Colon , Rectum Anus 7th edition primary tumor , regional node , metastasis ( TNM ) classification . Circumferential margin involvement define exposure cancer cell vertical dissection surface histological examination . Follow-up schedule - The follow-up schedule follow accord stage . Patients stag 0 1 follow outpatient examination include tumor marker measurement , chest , abdominal pelvic compute tomography ( CT ) year five year . Patients stage 2 3a examine CT tumor marker measurement every six month first two year . These examination do year third year fifth year . Patients stage 3b 3c examine CT tumor marker measurement every four month first two year , every six month third year fifth year . Statistical analysis - The primary endpoint anastomotic leakage rate . - The secondary endpoint operation time , amount bleed 5-year overall survival . To evaluate whether difference operative procedure influence survival include death due another disease , comparison overall survival meaning . Operation time amount bleeding add secondary endpoint parameter possibility become ground selection operation method difference overall survival . - A sample size 284 patient assure achieve power 70 % detect difference group use two-sided Chi-squared test type I error rate equal 0.05 , true complication rate 4 % 12 % LT HT group , respectively . A sample size 300 patient assure achieve power 73 % detect difference condition . The dropout consider number accumulation target assume 300 patient keep power 70 % . - For continuous variable , data present mean Â± standard deviation ( SD ) . For categorical variable , data present frequency percentage ( % ) . Comparison endpoint base intention-to-treat principle , , patient switch another group surgery treat member allocate group . The Chi-squared test apply evaluate significance difference proportion , t-test use evaluate significance difference continuous variable . A p-value le 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
