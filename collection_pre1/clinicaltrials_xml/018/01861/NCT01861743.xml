	<brief_summary>Most patient undergo surgery experience significant post-operative pain . Inadequate peri-operative pain management may decrease post-operative mobilization increase length hospitalization . Additionally , poorly manage acute post-operative pain analgesia associate increase risk develop chronic pain delay wound heal . Lumbar spine surgery particularly painful , often require multi-day hospitalization . The common post-operative analgesia use spine surgery narcotic medication deliver via intravenous patient control analgesia ( IV PCA ) . A multimodal peri-operative pain management protocol spine surgery potential decrease pain also improve recovery , decrease narcotic consumption , decrease length stay hospital reduce direct indirect hospital cost . The purpose study determine post-operative pain rate recovery improve patient undergo spine surgery use MMA compare usual analgesic care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Multimodal Analgesia Versus Routine Care Pain Management</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We hypothesize patient undergoing spinal fusion receive peri-operative MMA : 1. decrease post-operative pain compare patient receive usual care pain management . 2. short hospital LOS compare patient receive usual care pain management . 3. few analgesic-related post-operative complication ( urinary retention , ileus , etc ) compare patient receive usual care pain management . 4. improved physical functioning time hospital discharge compare patient receive usual care pain management . 5. good short long term outcome . Subjects randomize MMA ( Group 1 ) usual care ( Group 2 ) . The unit randomization week ( Monday Sunday ) . Each week randomly assign MMA usual care . Subjects hospitalize consecutive week continue pain regimen assign upon hospitalization .</detailed_description>
