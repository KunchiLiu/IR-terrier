	<brief_title>Tivantinib Treating Patients With Previously Treated Malignant Mesothelioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine objective response rate patient malignant mesothelioma treat ARQ 197 ( tivantinib ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression-free survival patient malignant mesothelioma treat ARQ 197 . II . To determine toxicity experienced patient malignant mesothelioma treat ARQ 197 . III . To determine median overall survival patient malignant mesothelioma treat ARQ 197 . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine frequency mesenchymal-epithelial transition ( MET ) gene amplification malignant mesothelioma patient tumor sample , correlate result MET immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) . II . To determine whether MET gene amplification result increase sensitivity ARQ 197 observe improved clinical outcome ( response rate [ RR ] progression free survival [ PFS ] ) compare without MET gene over-expression/amplification . III . To determine whether high baseline serum hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) , well change serum HGF treatment pre-defined early time point , correlate treatment efficacy clinical outcome , measure response rate progression-free survival . IV . To identify mutation sequence specific area MET gene tumor sample ( semaphorin [ SEMA ] , jumonji [ JM ] tyrosine kinase domains ) . V. To perform immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) mesothelioma tumor HGF , MET phosphorylated ( p ) -MET ( pY1003 pY1230/34/35 ) . VI . To assess serum HGF serum soluble MET level enzyme link immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) ( R &amp; D system ) pre-treatment , 2 cycle disease progression . OUTLINE : Patients receive tivantinib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) . Treatment continue absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 year .</detailed_description>
