	<brief_summary>The study prospective , open randomize , non-inferiority trial two parallel group , compare 6 week versus 12 week antibiotic treatment follow surgery procedure ( debridement retention , 1-stage 2 stage exchange ) . The duration treatment antibiotic prosthetic joint infection base expert ' opinion ; one vary 6 week several month accord custom influencer . The principal aim study explore efficacy safety 6 week versus 12 week antibiotic therapy duration , associate surgical procedure ( debridement retention implant , one-stage two stage exchange ) , PJI treatment .

	<brief_title>Treatment Infections Osteo-articular Prostheses 6 Versus 12 Weeks Antibiotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although infection risk follow primary hip knee arthroplasty less 2 % , prosthetic joint infection ( PJI ) become frequent due increase number patient undergoing surgery . PJI remain one serious complication prosthetic joint implantation . Each PJI episode represent substantial morbidity 5.3-7.2-fold high cost initial arthroplasty . The management PJI almost always necessitates need surgical intervention prolong course intravenous oral antimicrobial therapy . Despite significant amount basic clinical research field , many question pertain definition infection well diagnosis management infection remain unanswered . The optimal surgical antibiotic treatment PJI remain unclear . The infection implant difficult treat . According Infectious Diseases Society America recommendation Osmon et al . 2012 , antibiotic therapy duration varies : 3 month hip arthroplasty ( 6 month total knee arthroplasty ) PJI arthroplasty retention , 6 week two-stage exchange . Sometimes , excessive antibiotic treatment duration perform recommendation evidence-based sensu strictu base expert ' opinion . Short therapy benefit ecologic economic impact . While usual treatment parenteral route first 2-4 week , attitude evidence-based either . Up one-third patient PJI may experience antibiotic-related catheter-related problem parenteral treatment . The one-stage two-stage exchange infect implant rather comparable success rate surgical management PJI ( 90 % ) . Recent no-randomized study indicate short antibiotic therapy ( 6 week ) seem efficient . Our proposal study explore efficacy safety 6 week treatment PJI , surgical procedure . The principal aim study explore efficacy safety 6 week versus 12 week antibiotic therapy duration , associate surgical procedure ( debridement retention implant , one-stage two stage exchange ) , PJI treatment . Treatments antibiotic choose accord germ accord consensual recommendation . Used antibiotic already AMM indication . Eligible patient least one symptom relate PJI ( pain , sinus tract , inflammatory surgical scarâ€¦ ) microbiological documentation PJI.The primary endpoint occurrence clinical cure month 24 . Secondary endpoint ( ) adequate clinical biological response month 6 12 , ( ii ) incidence adverse event two group , ( iii ) oral and/or intravenous antibiotic therapy efficacy . Randomization stratify anatomical location infect joint ( hip knee ) surgical procedure ( debridement retention , 1-stage 2 stage exchange ) . The follow-up consist periodic clinical examination , anamnesis occasionally laboratory radiological control .</detailed_description>
