	<brief_title>Ado-Trastuzumab Emtansine Treating Patients With HER2-Positive Metastatic Locally Advanced Breast Cancer That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess change thrombokinetics ( platelet circulation life span ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression free survival ( PFS ) , duration response , benefit rate ( define stable disease , partial response , complete response Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] v 1.1 ) , overall response rate ( define partial complete response RECIST v 1.1 ) , survival . II . To evaluate safety ado-trastuzumab emtansine ( non-platelet toxicity ) . III . To evaluate pharmacokinetics ado-trastuzumab emtansine . OUTLINE : Patients receive ado-trastuzumab emtansine intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve response may continue treatment . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
