	<brief_summary>Head neck tumor common general population especially high risk group smoker alcohol abuser , well exposure various environmental factor . Diagnosis base identification patient gross disease physical examination various image method , characterization tissue mainly fine-needle puncture ( FNA ) biopsy . Determining stage disease base physical examination , image tissue sample . Using electronic nose technology hope identify microscopic disease suspect population risk , thus diagnose patient initial stage disease . Obviously , early diagnosis treatment decision hopefully improve prognosis . Finding positive correlation stage , level various tumor volume respiratory specimens finding classify patient accurately contribute characterization disease accurate , rapid non-invasive fashion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Characterization Head Neck Malignant Tumors Using Electronic Nose</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 60,000 new case head neck cancer diagnose U.S. year , account 5 % cancer case diagnose North America approximately 1-2 % cancer death . Smoking alcohol main risk factor head neck tumor recognize 75 % case . In contrast , consumption fruit vegetable find protective factor . The symptom vary include sore throat / neck , difficulty pain swallowing , difficulty breathe hoarseness , facial movement disorder . Multidisciplinary decision make treatment important patient due complexity treatment short-and long-term complication result chemotherapy , radiotherapy surgical intervention . About third patient diagnose disease stage 1 2 . These patient treat surgery radiation . Five year survival patient diagnosed stage I around 90 % 70 % patient diagnosed stage 2 . Despite surgical radiation treatment patient present locally advanced disease , 30 % -50 % survive five year . Therefore , many study conduct attempt improve prognosis . Improved result see combination therapy chemotherapy radiation treatment . Patient survival depend stage disease , hence importance early detection . Research Laboratory Dr. Hossam Haick develop device simulates human nose . The device reveals pattern volatile organic compound emit breathe cancer cell . This refer `` electronic nose '' . It include array tiny nanometer size sensor connect electronic computation unit . Because small size electrical property , sensor able `` smell '' change composition material characterize cancer . Discovery bio - cancer marker use breath sample offer several advantage : ) The breath sample invasive ; b ) air exhale contains mixture less complex find blood urine , c ) breath test allow direct monitoring real-time . In study want test reliability develop device real clinical condition . Another goal experiment characterize difference respiratory specimen various disease stage examine whether relationship result sample tumor volume ( calculate use diagnostic CT scan ) . Due simplicity , positive result allow u consider use device screen device head neck cancer .</detailed_description>
