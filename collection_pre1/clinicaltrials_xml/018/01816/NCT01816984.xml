	<brief_summary>This pilot randomize phase I/II trial study side effect best dose PI3K inhibitor BKM120 give together cetuximab see well work treat patient recurrent metastatic head neck cancer . PI3K inhibitor BKM120 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Monoclonal antibody , cetuximab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Giving PI3K inhibitor BKM120 together cetuximab may kill tumor cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>PI3K Inhibitor BKM120 Cetuximab Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Induction compensatory signaling/feedback loop signal one week BKM120 ( PI3K inhibitor BKM120 ) ( run-in ) compare patient treat BKM120 . II . Safety tolerability combine treatment BKM120 cetuximab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Induction apoptosis one week BKM120 ( run-in ) compare patient treat BKM . II . Tumor shrinkage ( base Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] version 1.1 [ V1.1 ] measurement ) patient treat combination . III . Response rate ( base RECIST V1.1 measurement ) patient treat combination . IV . Overall survival . V. Progression free survival . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study PI3K inhibitor BKM120 , follow phase II study . RUN-IN-PERIOD : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive PI3K inhibitor BKM120 orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day -7 0 . Patients complete 1 week washout dose escalation . ARM II : Patients receive treatment day -7 0 . All patient receive PI3K inhibitor BKM120 PO QD day 1-28 cetuximab intravenously ( IV ) 60-120 minute day 1 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 28 day .</detailed_description>
