	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study learn possible effect metformin extend release ( ER ) patient colon cancer adenoma surgery . The safety drug also study . Metformin-ER commonly use control blood sugar level patient diabetes . It also design block protein tumor cell important tumor growth blood vessel development . This may cause cell death reduce spread disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open-Labeled Pilot Study Biomarker Response Following Short-Term Exposure Metformin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 group . - If Group 1 , receive metformin ER . You 2 3 chance assign Group 1 . - If Group 2 , receive treatment . You 1 3 chance assign Group 2 . Study Drug Administration : If Group 1 , You start take drug day colonoscopy ( later surgery schedule 30 day colonoscopy ) continue take schedule surgery ( 30 day ) . During first week take one tablet metformin-ER mouth one time day food . From begin second week schedule surgery , take two tablet metformin-ER mouth one time day food . If side effect , dose may lower . If Group 2 , receive study drug time colonoscopy surgery . Study Visits : On day colonoscopy : - Your medical history record ask drug may take . - You physical exam . - Extra tissue sample collect colonoscopy routine biomarker test . Biomarkers small piece material substance find tissue may provide information condition disease . - The study staff call 1 week colonoscopy ask general health side effect may . On day surgery day surgery : - Your weight measure . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test research safety metformin-ER may affect disease . This routine blood draw include pregnancy test able become pregnant . - You ask general health side effect may . - During surgery , extra tissue sample collect biomarker test . Length Study : You study 30 day . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study surgery . This investigational study . Metformin-ER FDA approve commercially available treatment type 2 diabetes . Its use study investigational . Up 23 patient take part study . All enrol MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
