	<brief_summary>In combination exist literature , previous work indicate 1 ) woman poor ovarian response fulfil `` Bologna criterion '' low pregnancy rate , irrespective age 2 ) current treatment protocol demonstrate ongoing pregnancy rate exceed 8.5 % 3 ) corifollitropin alfa follow hpHMG might increase ongoing pregnancy rate young patient ( &lt; 40years old ) fulfil criterion . These finding provide strong rationale definitive large RCT . The COMPORT study provide conclusive evidence regard superiority novel protocol corifollitropin alfa follow hpHMG treatment young poor ovarian responder fulfil Bologna criterion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Corifollitropin Alfa Followed Menotropin Poor Ovarian Responders Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently , European Society Human Reproduction Embryology develop new definition order select patient suitable inclusion future clinical trial poor ovarian responder , so-called `` Bologna criterion '' . However , limited number study publish date include patient poor ovarian response accord `` Bologna criterion '' , whereas randomize trial publish ongoing population . Preliminary report `` Bologna poor responder '' highlight limit prospect woman . Natural cycle IVF show result disappointingly low live birth rate , regardless patient ' age ovarian stimulation widely accept treatment modality , e.g . short agonist protocol , appear demonstrate substantial benefit . Nonetheless , despite disappointing result vast majority preliminary study population , recent pilot study group show specific protocol may indeed promise option woman young age fulfil `` Bologna criterion '' . Corifollitropin alfa follow highly purify hMG antagonist protocol demonstrate ongoing pregnancy rate 28 % woman &lt; 40years , strongly suggest conduction future randomize trial test novel treatment protocol</detailed_description>
