	<brief_summary>The recently introduce Computed tomography ( CT ) scanner , Discovery CT750 HD ( GE Healthcare , Milwaukee ) , incorporate battery innovation aim improve diagnostic image quality , evaluate perfusion assess scar , effort address current shortcoming Computed tomographic coronary angiography ( CTCA ) patient significant coronary artery disease . The new scanner use novel method scanning ( Cardiac Gemstone Spectral Imaging - Cardiac GSI ) image reconstruction ( Adaptive Statistical Iterative Reconstruction- ASIR ) oppose standard definition 64-slice CT Multi-detector row compute tomography ( MDCT ) Filtered Back Projection ( FBP ) use conventional CT scanner . The Cardiac GSI protocol enable scanner acquire image two different x-ray energy almost simultaneously , post-processed selectively reduce beam harden artefact delete material specific attenuate property image , coronary calcium . ASIR offset potential increase radiation dose require Cardiac GSI scan . This potentially result image higher diagnostic quality equivalent perhaps low dose radiation compare present technology . Furthermore , hypothesise dual-energy acquisition may improve accuracy assessment perfusion . Although initial in-vitro result encourage , technology rigorously assess regard feasibility diagnostic quality , limit applicability routine clinical practice . This assessment require trial compare accuracy Cardiac GSI CTCA Invasive coronary angiography ( ICA ) anatomical assessment stenosis , Myocardial Perfusion Imaging Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ( MPI-SPECT ) assessment perfusion Cardiac Magnetic Resonance ( CMR ) assessment myocardial scar . We design pilot study regard help u assess feasibility scan protocol provide data power large study assess diagnostic remit Cardiac GSI scan assessment patient high-risk significant coronary artery disease myocardial scar .</brief_summary>
