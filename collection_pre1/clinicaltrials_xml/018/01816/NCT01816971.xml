	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well carfilzomib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone stem cell transplant work treat patient newly diagnose multiple myeloma . Carfilzomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Biological therapy , lenalidomide , may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Drugs use chemotherapy , dexamethasone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell stop dive . Giving carfilzomib , lenalidomide , dexamethasone stem cell transplant may kill cancer cell</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Carfilzomib , Lenalidomide , Dexamethasone Before After Stem Cell Transplant Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine rate stringent complete response ( CR ) ( sCR ) 8 cycle CRd ( 4 cycle induction + autologous stem cell transplant [ ASCT ] + 4 cycle carfilzomib , lenalidomide , low dose dexamethasone [ CRd ] consolidation ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Overall response rate define partial response well ( &gt; = partial response [ PR ] ) include rate good partial response ( VGPR ) good ( &gt; = VGPR ) near complete response well ( sCR/CR/nCR ) across entire treatment high risk low risk patient . II . Duration response ( DOR ) , progression free survival ( PFS ) , time progression ( TTP ) , overall survival ( OS ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determination rate minimal residual disease patient achieve CR . II . Prospective evaluation candidate marker response CRd establish complete CRd trial . III . Evaluation marker response duration response treatment strategy use CRd without transplant . OUTLINE : INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients receive dexamethasone intravenously ( IV ) orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1 , 8 , 15 22 ; carfilzomib IV 10-30 minute day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 , 16 ; lenalidomide PO QD day 1-21 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity.. TRANSPLANT : Patients undergo autologous stem cell transplant . CONSOLIDATION THERAPY : Patients receive dexamethasone , carfilzomib , lenalidomide induction . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Patients receive dexamethasone lenalidomide induction therapy carfilzomib IV 30 minute day 1 , 2 , 15 , 16 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 10 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
