	<brief_title>Development Testing New Generation Diabetic Footwear</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>DiaBSmart project aim generate , transfer exchange clinical , academic production knowledge partner create new generation diabetic footwear newly develop patient assessment system . The transfer knowledge various sector ensures need patient consider transferred effectively product development use scientific approach . The objective include : ( 1 ) design development integrated system DIABetic foot assessment ( 2 ) validate newly develop system use experimental method ( 3 ) develop suitable material meet mechanical clinical requirement ( 4 ) evaluate mechanical clinical effectiveness material choice reduce potential risk foot complication . The Numerical , Experimental Mathematical Analyses system integrate aspect diabetic footwear include ; clinical biomechanical assessment , material choice aesthetic design . Proposed interdisciplinary , inter-sectorial approach unique bring together expertise research institution , industry clinic . This project enhance knowledge base diabetic assessment ; clear impact new product development lead clinical economic benefit . The product include new generation integrate SMART /multi material midsoles and/or orthoses diabetic footwear . Properties material optimise view minimise/ redistribute pressure hence stress soft tissue critical plantar area foot . Whilst significantly affect course disease , product aim reduce risk limb loss patient diabetes , frequent cause non-traumatic lower-limb amputation .</detailed_description>
