	<brief_summary>This study involve screen portal vein thrombosis portal hypertension patient Philadelphia negative myeloproliferative neoplasm ( MPNs ) . These include polycythemia vera ( PV ) , essential thrombocythemia ( ET ) , myelofibrosis . Portal vein thrombosis portal hypertension serious complication often see myeloproliferative patient . These complication usually diagnose patient become symptomatic , often already advanced stage . They progress cause non-reversible damage liver , also call cirrhosis liver . As result , patient often accumulate fluid abdomen ascites ; develop swell vein line esophagus know varix . If untreated , varix risk rupture result life-threatening bleeding . When diagnosed advanced stage , treatment usually supportive therapy treatment available present reverse condition . This study look screen two condition use Doppler ultrasound upper gastrointestinal endoscopy .</brief_summary>
