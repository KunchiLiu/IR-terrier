	<detailed_description>The long-term goal integrate project contribute curb rise rate childhood obesity effective , multi-component , relationship skill-building educational intervention foster infant-centered feeding promote appropriate maternal responsiveness , feed style , feed practice infant transition solid food . Research Objectives : To evaluate effectiveness Healthy Babies ( HB ) compare Expanded Food Nutrition Education Program ( EFNEP ) two point time ( infant 6 12 month age ) mother infants maternal responsiveness , feed style , feed practice infant ' transition solid food , compare infant feed self-regulation growth pattern infant 6 12 month age two group , HB EFNEP . Hypothesis : Compared mother infant receive traditional EFNEP lesson , mother receive HB lesson achieve improvement ( infant 6 month old sustained time infant 12 month age ) : - Maternal responsiveness ( measure appropriately interpret respond infant cue transition infant solid food Parent-Child Interaction-Feeding Scale [ PCI-F ] ) . - Maternal feeding style ( measure feeding belief behavior Infant Feeding Styles Questionnaire ) . - Feeding practice ( measure use appropriate feeding practice transition infant solid food PCI-F ) . Research Question : How infant HB ( intervention ) group compare infants traditional EFNEP group infant 6 12 month old : - Infant feed self-regulation ( measure clarity cue feed responsiveness PCI-F ) . - Infant growth pattern ( measure growth chart ) . Extension Objective : To evaluate feasibility , fidelity , educational effectiveness HB intervention . ( Process Evaluation ) Research Question : What feasibility integration within Extension paraprofessional deliver HB mother infant ' receive HB lesson , relate : - Paraprofessionals ' training , ability deliver intervention ( fidelity ) , satisfaction intervention ; - Mothers ' acceptance ( recruitment ) , completion ( retention ) , satisfaction intervention . Research Question : What educational effect intervention maternal knowledge , attitude , self-efficacy related infant feeding ? Research Design . The study use randomize clinical trial design participant Michigan ( MI ) Colorado ( CO ) randomly assign HB intervention control ( EFNEP ) group . The HB intervention , deliver paraprofessional ( educator ) , design foster appropriate maternal responsiveness , feed style , feed practice . Participants blind group assignment . Data collect three time point separate data collection team ( educator ) : baseline ( first lesson ) , follow-up ( infant six month old ) , post follow-up ( infant 12 month old ) . These time point select base infant 's age , infant six month old , usual time frame introduce solid food recommend initiated infant , 12 month , infant establish eat pattern solid food . Thus , point time select rather immediately follow lesson consistency infant age . The age infant time enrollment standardize time intervention , intervention begin infant 1 4 month age . Three time point include make statistical comparison assess sustainability change . Process data collect throughout study . Participant Recruitment . A total 546 mother-infant recruit community agency provide service pregnant woman mother infant Michigan Colorado ( i.e. , EFNEP , Breast Feeding Initiative , Women , Infants Children 's Special Supplemental Nutrition Program Women , Infants , Children ) . Given state 's demographic , Michigan high proportion Black minority dyads Colorado high proportion Hispanic/Latina dyad . Though race/ethnicity/culture specific focus study , sample size allow u examine race/ethnic/cultural similarity difference . The investigator recruit 546 eligible family MI CO allow 25 % attrition ( data collection ) , leave 278 family post follow-up ( infant 12 month old ) available data analysis .</detailed_description>
