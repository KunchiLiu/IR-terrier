	<detailed_description>Background : In light importance pain widespread interest patient-centeredness , Department Veterans Affairs ( VA ) emphasize successfully make pain management routine feature health record focus care . Awareness pain effort improve pain management rest VA 's '5th Vital Sign ' - policy practice nursing staff routinely screen 'pain ' every health encounter use 0-10 Numeric Rating Scale ( NRS ) . The team 's previous research VA 's '5th Vital Sign ' informs specific design Effective Screening Pain ( ESP ) study well propose research product . Alternatives current pain screen approach may improve sensitivity specificity screen chronic pain . These alternative include nurse administer NRS one week look back period three item scale ( PEG ) incorporate intensity emotional physical interference . The PEG similar gold standard Brief Pain Inventory ( BPI ) derive , sensitivity , specificity , sensitivity change detect clinically important , functionally impair pain . The investigator plan evaluate alternative VA 's current '5th Vital Sign ' pain screening , focus simple , feasible measure use cross-sectionally pain screening . In set primary care clinic , investigator plan cross-sectionally evaluate three arm - nurse document NRS , tablet computer-based NRS one week , tablet computer-based PEG . Objectives : 1 ) Qualitatively evaluate Veteran multidisciplinary provider perspective pain screen use NRS vs. PEG item , point care vs. mobile reporting , clinician-assessed vs. patient-reported pain , usefulness medical chart patient-derived health information screening , assessment , management , follow-up pain . 2a ) Quantitatively assess , 3-arm randomize control primary care clinical team-based trial use tablet , feasibility completion rate , validity , variability pain information obtain comparing : Tablet-based vs. nurse-documented pain ( e.g. , 5th vital sign tablet vs. clinician assess ) rate severity pain detect tablet-based 'NRS one week ' ( Arm 1 ) , tablet-based PEG ( Arm 2 ) , usual 5th vital sign ( Arm 3 ) . Also pain , self-reported disability , Veteran satisfaction pain screen mode chronic pain detection . 2b ) Informed Aims 1 2a , qualitatively evaluate provider perspective different pain report feature informatics prototype facilitate good pain management . Methods : The investigator conduct two phase mixed method study build prior work develop test enhance pain screen approach primary care Patient Aligned Care Teams ( PACTs ) . In first ( development ) phase study , investigator conduct semi-structured qualitative interview focus group primary care clinician , primary care team member include non-provider staff , primary care Veteran patient , understand patient-reported pain assessment data useful clinical decision-making pain information best integrate primary care team process , include role informatics optimize primary care pain management link pain screening management . This inform development enhance pain screening approach use Aim 2 randomize control trial ( RCT ) . The investigator also submit enhanced tablet-based pain screening approach usability test University California Office Information Technology . The second ( test ) phase study include multisite RCT test final enhance pain screening approach ( Arm 1 PEG ; Arm 2 NRS 'pain ' ) compare NRS one week ( Arm 3 ) , patient primary care clinician outcomes . The investigator assess whether approach improve detection pain-related impairment , also feasibility , acceptability , provider patient experience enhance screening . Status : The investigator complete Aim 1 data collection , cod , analysis . They present finding conference poster presentation two conference . Two manuscript currently review others prepared submission . Findings Aim 1 use guide development tablet-based pain screen survey investigator test Aim 2a randomize control trial . The investigator complete data collection , currently analyze result . For Aim 2b , investigator complete qualitative semi-structured interview provider perspective pain reporting process , begin analyze transcript . The investigator conduct several interview patient continue collect analyze interview .</detailed_description>
