	<detailed_description>Background : AF mostly disease elderly . Up 10 % people age 80 year old suffer arrhythmia rate project triple next 20 year ( 1 ) . Evidence emerge AF may increase risk form dementia ( 2 ) . Cerebral hypoperfusion risk cerebrovascular micro- macro-embolism plausible explanation predisposition cognitive decline AF ( 1 ) . Such insult may act alone concert neuropathological change common brain old individual neuritic plaque neurofibrillary tangle , lower cognitive reserve accelerate onset dementia ( 3 ) . Prior study AF dementia yield conflict result . An early study provide evidence support association AF increase incidence dementia patient stroke ( 4 ) . In prospective study conduct participant ONTARGET TRANSCEND trial , reveal cognitive functional decline important consequence atrial fibrillation , even absence overt stroke ( 5 ) . Another independent study , observe similar result risk dementia AF participant without clinically recognize stroke follow-up ( 3 ) . Evidences previous research demonstrate significant association AF form dementia include Alzheimer 's disease , also high mortality rate patient coexistent dementia AF ( 2 ) . On contrary , study find significant risk-association AF dementia ( 6-8 ) . These contradictory result compel necessity prospective study large population obtain clear understand association AF cognitive impairment . The potential association two condition important clinical implication ; causal relationship AF dementia different therapeutic strategy AF may differ influence dementia risk ( 3 ) . Thus , knowledge would facilitate personalize treatment approach individual AF . Anti-arrhythmic drug consider first line therapy AF catheter ablation widely-recognized best option drug-refractory case . Recent publish data suggest effective rhythm-control catheter ablation reverse risk dementia AF ( 9 ) . However , epidemiologic study health-care database ICD code use identify clinical dementia . Therefore , mischaracterization dementia subtypes major possibility study . None currently ongoing study registry AF ablation US include dementia one outcomes assess . Therefore , study first examine benefit successful catheter ablation cognitive function AF patient directly assess cognition use standardized instrument . There several standardize screening tool available assess cognitive status , namely Mini-Mental State Examination ( MMSE ) , Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument ( CASI ) Montreal cognitive assessment ( MoCA ) . All strengths limitation , MoCA consider efficient cross-cultural applicability high sensitivity detect mild cognitive impairment . In study , MoCA would use evaluate cognitive status AF patient . Besides MoCA , follow questionnaire use assess risk-factors cognitive impairment quality life AF patient 1 . Hospital anxiety Depression scale ( HAD ) : evaluate anxiety depression 2 . Katz Index Independence Activities Daily Living ( ADL ) Lawton 's Instrumental Activities Of Daily Living Scale ( IADL ) : assess independent living skill 3 . Multidimensional Scale Perceived Social Support Zimet et al : appraise perception social-support study 4. International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( IPAQ ) : obtain internationally comparable data health-related physical activity 5 . Atrial Fibrillation Effect Quality-of-Life ( AFEQT ) questionnaire : assess AF-specific change QoL ablation Study Objectives Primary Objectives : To evaluate number patient show improvement no-worsening cognitive status 2 year follow-up catheter ablation begin drug-therapy non-ablation group Secondary Objectives : 1 . Study interaction depression , social support cognitive status 2 . Evaluate impact social support trajectory dementia 3 . Examine correlation physical activity cognitive impairment 4 . Assess impact arrhythmia recurrence dementia across control study group Study Design : This prospective multicenter study enroll 888 consecutive AF patient different center US , Asia Europe .</detailed_description>
