	<brief_title>Direct Visual Fluorescence Finding Oral Cancer High-Risk Patients Patients Undergoing Routine Dental Care</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess diagnostic benefit VELscope ( direct visual fluorescence ) inspection oral examination . II . Efficacy VELscope identify dysplastic ( premalignant ) malignant oral mucosal lesion discriminate lesion common benign tissue change . III . Accuracy clinical judgment versus VELscope finding . IV . Ability VELscope identify lesion extent lesion beyond clinically apparent . OUTLINE : Patients undergo conventional oral examination ( COE ) follow direct visual fluorescence examination ( DVFE ) . Patients tissue abnormality find COE DVFE undergo scalpel biopsy within 2 week .</detailed_description>
