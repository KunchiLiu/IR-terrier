The study hypothesis study intervention result reduce prevalence unprotected anal intercourse ( UAI ) act among HIV+ MSM 6-month follow-up partner negative unknown HIV status . The secondary hypothesis intervention result ( 1 ) reduce prevalence UAI 6-months follow-up partner HIV+ , ( 2 ) reduction number sexual partner . This 2-site , 2-arm , randomize control trial randomize 180 participant either 8 session group motivational interviewing intervention ( GPS ) start within 2 week randomization , wait-list control group .

Participants group complete interview end 8 session 6-month follow . GPS take form small counseling group , since one common intervention form similar population . Participants organize 15 group per arm approximately 6 participant , lead 2 facilitator HIV+ MSM . This study build upon one-armed open-label Canadian Institutes Health Research ( CIHR ) -funded grant demonstrate GPS feasible administer appear result significant risk reduction . The study also show GPS result promise reduction UAI , thus form solid foundation move toward RCT . In preliminary GPS data ( n=25 ) , find reduction UAI 88 % baseline 60 % 3-month follow-up . More importantly HIV prevention , find reduction UAI partner HIV-negative unknown HIV status 56 % baseline 36 % 6 month follow-up . Participants report high satisfaction GPS program initial study site find GPS highly feasible community organization . The propose study provide data efficacy motivational interview behavioural intervention HIV+ MSM . Although research among primarily American sample document moderate effect size HIV prevention intervention among MSM , none find significant effect HIV prevention intervention HIV+ MSM Canada , study examine effect small-group base intervention use HIV+ MSM peer train administer motivational interviewing HIV+ MSM . Armed data present study demonstrate efficacy intervention , design implement next stage research program , Phase IV study examine effectiveness intervention Toronto , Vancouver , least 2 site serve HIV+ MSM Canada . The intervention result decrease likelihood risky sex versus waitlist .
