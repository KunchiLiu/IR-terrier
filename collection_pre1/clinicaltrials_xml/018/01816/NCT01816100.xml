	<brief_summary>This study unique blend new technology never use combination individual diagnose Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) . The result research define change brain activity , functional brain activation diffusion brain follow 6 month structure weight resistance balance training . Positive change would indicate therapy ignite brain plasticity may drive brain repair . These change brain may affect recovery result neuroplasticity , neuroprotection , slow neural degeneration . No trial publish evaluate brain plasticity utilizing diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) subject MS undergo physical training . DTI demonstrate ability find change ( plasticity ) occur brain use MEG finding focus DTI analysis optimize capacity detect change secondary therapy . This quantification give good understand repair go brain , may potentially revolutionize field central nervous system ( CNS ) rehabilitation . One innovative aspect study full integration clinical neurobehavioral metric functional image data conjunction proven MS therapy along quality life indicator . This approach allow new link illuminate trajectory functional structural brain change ( neuroplasticity ) mesh clinical improvement index collect visit-by-visit . This study also compare disease modify treatment ( DMTs ) effect ( ) indices brain plasticity cognitive behavioral assessment .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Rationale MEG direct measure ongoing neurophysiological activity appropriate spatiotemporal resolution measurement immunity technique vascular bias contaminate functional MRI image MS patients.4 MEG help illuminate brain base motor deficit exist relative healthy control show improvement observe behaviorally reflected brain activity underlies improvement . Since DTI demonstrate ability find change ( plasticity ) occur brain patient , promise DTI able detect evidence neuroplasticity research population.5 Using MEG finding sharpen DTI analysis , powerful combination , optimize ability detect understand change . Objectives Specific Aim 1 - Determine activation difference ( see ) neural region serve motor function basic movement use MEG group MS patient , compare MS affect portion brain versus non-affected . Specific Aim 2 - Determine effect specific 6 month resistance balance exercise program activation sensorimotor brain area use MEG , correlate change neural index specific movement balance . Specific Aim 3 - Determine effect specific 6 month resistance balance exercise program brain diffusivity fractional anisotropy use DTI correlate change metric improvement strength balance measure subject MS , compare MS affect portion brain versus non-affected areas.. Specific Aim 4 - Determine whether increased fiber integrity ( fractional anisotropy ) along corticospinal tract reflect MEG activation metric primary motor cortex baseline 6 month subject MS enrol three-month resistance balance exercise program .</detailed_description>
