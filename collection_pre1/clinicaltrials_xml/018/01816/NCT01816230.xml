	<detailed_description>Umbilical cord blood ( UCB ) alternative stem cell source hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) use treatment various life-threatening disease , hematological malignancy genetic blood disorder , case match related stem cell donor available . However , major drawback use valuable stem cell source limit cell dose single cord blood unit ( CBU ) , show associated inadequate hematopoietic reconstitution high risk transplant-related mortality . To improve outcome extend applicability UCB transplantation , one potential solution ex vivo expansion UCB-derived stem progenitor cell . NiCord® stem/progenitor cell base product compose ex vivo expand allogeneic UCB cell . NiCord® base novel technology ex vivo cell expansion cord blood derive hematopoietic progenitor cell . By increase number short long-term reconstitution progenitor cell transplant , NiCord® potential enable broad application UCB transplantation , improve clinical outcome UCB transplantation . The study design multi center , single arm study , evaluate safety efficacy transplantation NiCord® patient hematological malignancy follow myeloablative therapy . Total study duration approximately 400 day sign informed consent last visit one year follow transplantation The overall study objective evaluate safety efficacy NiCord® : single ex-vivo expand cord blood unit transplantation patient hematological malignancy follow myeloablative therapy follow : The main study objective assess cumulative incidence patient NiCord®-derived neutrophil engraftment 42 day follow transplantation assess incidence secondary graft failure 180 day follow transplantation NiCord® Ten evaluable patient recruit study 18-65 year age , maximum 15 treated patient .</detailed_description>
