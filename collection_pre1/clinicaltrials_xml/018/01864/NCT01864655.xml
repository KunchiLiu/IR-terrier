	<brief_summary>Alzheimer 's disease devastate neurodegenerative disorder , currently effective treatment slow halt progression . Beta amyloid peptide accumulate brain Alzheimer 's , think play major role trigger dementia . The investigator recently characterize molecular pathway ÃŸ-amyloid damage neuron , show protein term Fyn kinase crucial . Our data suggest block Fyn significant therapeutic benefit Alzheimer 's . Astra Zeneca develop blocker Fyn related kinase ( AZD0530 ) treatment cancer . Chronic AZD0530 administration well tolerated human , investigator propose test potential novel Alzheimer 's disease modifying therapy . This study ass safety tolerability AZD0530 patient Alzheimer 's disease .</brief_summary>
