	<criteria>Is 25 year old date enrolment Has confirm diagnosis retinitis pigmentosa , choroideremia conerod dystrophy Has visual acuity logMAR 2.3 bad eye determine Square Grating scale . Has functional ganglion cell optic nerve activity Has memory former useful form vision Understands accepts obligation present schedule followup visit . Has AP eye dimension appropriate dimension implant ( In Germany : Has AP eye dimension 20.5 25 mm ) Has head dimension appropriate visual Interface . Has history severe glaucoma , uveitis , optic neuropathy confirm damage optic nerve and/or visual cortex , Has disease ( study allow disease ) condition affect retinal function study eye ( e.g. , central retinal artery/vein occlusion , endstage diabetic retinopathy , current prior retinal detachment , infectious inflammatory retinal disease , etc . ) , Has disease condition prevents adequate visualization retina study eye include , limited , corneal degeneration resolve prior implantation , Has disease condition anterior segment study eye prevents adequate physical examination ( e.g. , ocular trauma , etc . ) , Has severe nystagmus , Has ocular condition lead eye rubbing , Has disease condition precludes understanding communication inform consent , study requirement test protocol ( e.g. , deafness , multiple sclerosis , amyotrophc lateral sclerosis , neuritis , etc ) , Has history epileptic seizure , Has history chronic recurrent infection inflammation would preclude participation study , Has know sensitivity contact material implant , Presents hypotony study eye , Presents hypertony study eye , Is pregnant lactating , Has another active implant device ( e.g . cochlear implant ) form metallic implant head ( dental work ) may interfere device function , Has diagnosis require active implant ( e.g. , cardiac pacemaker , vagus nerve implant , etc . ) , Has active cancer history intraocular , optic nerve brain cancer metastasis , Is immunesuppressed subject ( e.g. , due HIV positive diagnosis , etc . ) , Is carrier multiresistant germ , Requires use follow medication : Antimetabolites , Thrombocyte aggregation reduce therapy ( 10 day prior 3 day surgery ) , Oral anticoagulant ( 5 day 3 day surgery ) , Is participate another investigational drug device study may interfere propose treatment ensure followup schedule , ( Germany : Is participate another investigational drug device study ) Has health concern make general anaesthesia inadvisable , ( Germany : Patients ASAScore 3 high exclude study ) Is likely require MRI scan subsequent implantation prior explantation , Is likely require therapeutic ultrasound subsequent implantation prior explantation Retinal Implant In Germany : Patients recurrent chronic inflammation infection exclude study . Specifically patient follow disorder exclude : Common inflammation severe chronic consuming disease frequently associate infection ( e.g . Crohn disease , Whipple 's disease ) Chronic inflammation skin area eye ( e.g . dermatitis , rosacea , infection skin , herpes zoster ) Chronic inflammation area eye ( e.g . herpes cornea and/or conjunctiva , recurrent blepharoconjunctivitis , horedolum , chalazion ) In Germany : Has severe psychological disorder . When doubt , expert assessment need arrange clarify whether patient 's psychological health suitable trial . In Germany : Has severe renal , cardiac , hepatic etc . organ disease</criteria>
