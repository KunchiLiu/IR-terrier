	<brief_summary>Dry eye syndrome highly prevalent ocular disease increase incidence elderly population . Topically administered lubricant basis treatment disease . However , information corneal residence time topical lubricant still sparse , therefore ideal treatment regimen find . Recently new method assessment tear film thickness base optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) become available . The aim present study assess corneal residence time three different formulation topical lubricant , particular Thealoz Duo® Eye Drops , Hyabak® Eye Drops Hydrabak® Eye Drops patient moderate dry eye disease . In addition , standard test dry eye syndrome , ocular surface disease index ( OSDI© ) , Schirmer I test determination tear break time ( BUT ) performed..</brief_summary>
