	<brief_summary>RATIONALE : Placing tumor antigen chimeric receptor create laboratory patient autologous donor-derived T cell may make body build immune response kill cancer cell . PURPOSE : This clinical trial study genetically engineer lymphocyte therapy treat patient CD33 positive acute myeloid leukemia relapse ( stem cell transplantation intensive chemotherapy ) refractory chemotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine safety feasibility chimeric antigen receptor T cell transduce anti-CD33 vector ( refer CART-33 cell ) . II . Determine duration vivo survival CART-33 cell . RT-PCR ( reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ) analysis whole blood use detect quantify survival CART-33 TCR zeta : CD137 TCR ( T-cell receptor ) zeta cell time . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . For patient detectable disease , measure anti-leukemia response due CART-33 cell infusion . II . To determine CD137 transgene superior TCR zeta transgene measure relative engraftment level CART-33 TCR zeta : CD137 TCR zeta cell time . III . Estimate relative traffic CART-33 cell bone marrow . IV . For patient store accessible leukemia blast , determine leukemia cell kill CART-33 cell vitro . V. Determine cellular humoral host immunity develop murine anti-CD33 , assess correlation loss detectable CART-33 ( loss engraftment ) . VI . Determine relative subset CART-33 T cell ( Tcm , Tem , Treg ) . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 group accord order enrollment . Patients receive anti-CD33-CAR ( couple CD137 CD3 zeta signal domain ) vector-transduced autologous T cell day 0,1 , 2 absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow intensively 6 month , every 3 month 2 year , annually thereafter 13 year .</detailed_description>
