	<brief_summary>The PENELOPEB study design demonstrate background standard anti-hormonal therapy palbociclib provide superior invasive disease-free survival ( iDFS ) compare placebo pre- postmenopausal woman HR-positive/HER2-normal early breast cancer high risk relapse show less pathological complete response neoadjuvant taxane- containing chemotherapy . Considering high risk recurrence patient neoadjuvant chemotherapy high CPS-EG score , palbociclib appear attractive option favourable safety profile patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Palbociclib Addition Standard Endocrine Treatment Hormone Receptor Positive Her2 Normal Patients With Residual Disease After Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>About one third patient hormone-receptor ( HR ) -positive , HER2- normal breast cancer residual disease neoadjuvant chemotherapy substantial risk relapse . The clinical-pathologic stage - estrogen/grade ( CPS-EG ) 1 combine clinical stage neoadjuvant treatment , pathological stage neoadjuvant treatment , grade estrogen-receptor status use identify high-risk patient . The CPS-EG score additionally validated 2454 patient HRpositive/ HER2-normal tumor German neoadjuvant study ' metadatabase . Patients score 3 high Score 2 ypN+ disease show 3-years iDFS 77 % despite adequate local therapy adjuvant endocrine treatment . Cyclin dependent kinase ( CDK ) , group serine/threonine kinase , play key role regulate cell cycle progression interact specific cyclin proteins luminal-type tumors.2,3 PD-0332991 ( palbociclib ) oral , highly selective inhibitor CDK4/6 kinase activity prevent cellular DNA synthesis prohibit progression cell cycle G1 S phase block retinoblastoma ( Rb ) phosphorylation.4 Preclinical study identify luminal ER subtype , elevate expression cyclin D1 Rb protein , reduce p16 expression associate sensitivity palbociclib .</detailed_description>
