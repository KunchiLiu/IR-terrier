	<brief_title>A Phase 2 Biomarker - Enriched Study TH-302 Subjects With Advanced Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypoxia independent marker poor prognosis subject metastatic melanoma ( Simonetti 2012 , Lartigau 1997 ) . Hypoxic melanoma cell likely exhibit stem-cell like phenotype associate increased propensity invasion , angiogenesis , metastasis formation compare normoxic cell . Moreover , phenotype also associate treatment resistance . TH-302 , hypoxia activate prodrug ( HAP ) , design target hypoxic nature tumours minimal effect normoxic tissue . TH-302 belongs class alkylating agent significant experimental clinical activity ( Brock 1989 ) . Preclinical data support hypothesis TH-302 target hypoxic region tumour also able kill tumour cell normoxic region result cytotoxin diffusion , lead significant effect tumour growth ( Meng 2011 ) . TH-302 investigate 700 subject solid tumour hematologic malignancy , include subject metastatic melanoma . In subset disease control rate 63 % ( 3 subject partial response 9 subject stable disease total 19 ) observe early phase clinical trial TH-302 ( Weber 2010 ) . Predictive biomarkers response toxicity yet identify subject advance melanoma treat TH-302 . Optimal patient selection may critical maximize clinical benefit . A predictive biomarker approach investigate try identify subject likely benefit TH-302 . Given hypoxia-targeting mechanism TH- 302 , believe hypoxia biomarkers informative identify subject likely benefit TH- 302 ; however , additional biomarkers include DNA repair biomarkers also investigate . In addition , approach also potential synergise future immunotherapeutic approach suppressive T regulatory cell think reside within hypoxic niche within tumour microenvironment would amenable target TH-302 .</detailed_description>
