	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes ( DM2 ) affect nearly 20 million people United States impair glucose regulation ( IGR ) , include impaired glucose tolerance ( IGT ) , impaired fasting glucose ( IFG ) , early diabetes affect considerably large unknown population group . At current time effective therapy completely prevent , reverse neuropathy associate IGR represent considerable challenge rehabilitation . There particularly strong incentive prevent IGT related complication advance DM2 . IGR grow problem among old adult strong association many functional limitation , particularly mobility limitation , always recognize , even though diabetes-related disability occur 2/3 old adult diabetes associate dependency , poor quality life , increase acute long-term care utilization . Autonomic dysfunction significant problem subject IGT . The Preliminary Data show 90 % subject IGT abnormal score questionnaire autonomic symptom lightheadedness , dry mouth dry eye , pale blue foot , foot colder rest body , decrease sweating foot increase sweat hand , nausea bloat eating , persistent diarrhea constipation , leak urine . In addition , patient IGR impair balance control . These factor increase risk fall affected subject . A non-randomized non-controlled study show diet exercise intervention patient diabetes lead overall improvement autonomic function . Furthermore , show stand balance improve balance intervention program . However , publish study assess effect intense physical activity intervention autonomic function IGR relate neuropathy . This study test aerobic exercise balance intervention participant IGR . The investigator examine individually tailor , carefully monitor , Diet , Physical Activity , Balance Enhancement Program ( DPAEP ) improve autonomic function balance control compare patient receive standard care . Improving balance control autonomic function decrease risk fall significant effect health participant . The research also significant test subject either become diabetic , early stage diabetes , thus enhance chance reverse autonomic neuropathy balance impairment . Furthermore , study design test whether improvement autonomic function balance associate improvement clinical outcome , quality life , metabolic state participant . Thus , propose intervention likely real life impact participant health .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In propose study , investigator determine intense , individually tailor , carefully monitor , Diet , Physical Activity Balance Enhancement Program ( DPAEP ) improve autonomic function balance measure autonomic balance control . In contrast , primary secondary efficacy measure compare standard care control ( SC ) receive general diet physical activity information . The `` Improving Autonomic Function Balance Diabetic Neuropathy '' study single blind , randomize study determine intensive diet exercise program improve autonomic function balance . Following baseline test , participant randomize either DPAEP SC group . DPAEP participant receive intensive physical activity enhancement program focus aerobic activity balance program .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Impaired glucose regulation time screen within three month screen . This definition include patient IFG , IGT , early mild DM2 . Patients include increase risk diabetes HBA1C great equal 5.7 % ( use method certify National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Program ) , diabetes HBA1C great equal 6.5 % , abnormal fast venous glucose , abnormal venous glucose value follow 75 gram oral glucose load . Glucose value define ( mg/dl ) : IFG fast glucose 100125 mg/dl , IGT fast less 126 , 2 h 140199 , diabetes fast glucose great equal 126 , 2 h great equal 200 base Standards Medical Care Diabetes 2010 American Diabetes Association . The HbA1c may normal , less 9 % . If diabetic subject medication , stable medication least 3 month prior enter study . Addition change antidiabetic medication ( medication ) enrollment affect participation group assignment . Impaired glucose regulation likely cause neuropathy ( determined medical history , family history , history medication , occupational history , history exposure toxin ( include significant alcohol use ) , physical neurological examination , appropriate laboratory study . Autonomic neuropathy define Toronto Diabetic Neuropathy Expert Group 2010/11 consensus criterion . Subjects enter study ( 1 ) increase symptom autonomic neuropathy base increase number symptom ( &gt; 3 ) OR impact score ( &gt; 7 ) validate SAS OR ( 2 ) least two abnormality autonomic testing . The autonomic testing include : ( ) heart rate variability ( E : I ratio heart rate rangeHRR ) , ( b ) Valsalva ratio , ( c ) Valsalva beat beat blood pressure variation , ( ) 30:15 ratio , ( e ) tilt table testing , ( f ) QSART value . Age 30 ( exclude patient type 1 diabetes ) 80 year inclusive Medically stable time enrollment . Women childbearing potential must use acceptable method contraception prevent pregnancy enrol study must agree continue practice acceptable method contraception duration participation study . Patient must agree take alternative medication coumadin undergo skin biopsy . Pregnant woman , prisoner , institutionalized subject risk subject include study . Neuropathy due factor impair glucose regulation base careful clinical laboratory evaluation physician . Current severe medical condition active day screen would affect patient 's ability participate complete study . Autonomic neuropathy severe would limit patient 's ability participate study intervention .</criteria>
