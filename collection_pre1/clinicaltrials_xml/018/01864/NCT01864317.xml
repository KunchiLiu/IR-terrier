	<brief_summary>Glaucoma among lead cause blindness western world . Elevated intraocular pressure ( IOP ) identify important risk factor . However , patient progress despite adequate IOP lower subject elevate IOP never develop glaucoma . Other patient develop glaucoma although IOP measurement always normal range . Therefore , factor must involve . In last year , study use MRI perform evidence accumulate also change retrobulbar structure present , particular lateral geniculate nucleus visual cortex . However , study limit low spatial resolution MRI instrument use . The investigator propose overcome problem use ultrahigh-field Magnetom 7T whole-body MR scanner ( Siemens Medical , Germany ) instal MR Centre Excellence Medical University Vienna . This scanner equip 32-channel head coil SC72 high-performance gradient system thus perfectly suit structural functional imaging . The aim present study investigate whether structural functional parameter alter patient primary open angle glaucoma ( POAG ) , normal tension glaucoma ( NTG ) , ocular hypertension ( OHT ) compare healthy control subject . The exact topographical survey intracranial structure LGN assessment neuronal structure DTI may allow good assessment therapeutic response new neuroprotective agent .</brief_summary>
