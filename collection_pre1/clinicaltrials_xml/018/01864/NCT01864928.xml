	<brief_summary>Despite abundant evident support use acute reperfusion therapy set acute ischemic stroke ( AIS ) , adoption practice routine clinical care poor . We hypothesize significant barrier difficulty weigh benefit risk rt-PA treatment care individual patient , problem compound time urgency decision-making clinical fear weigh risk treatment heavily benefit . The goal Quality Improvement ( QI ) study leverage IT solution develop , ePRISM , execute multivariable risk model patient-specific data personalize estimate individual 's outcome ( risk benefit ) without rt-PA , generate support safer , effective clinical care . Through early project , program ePRISM best available risk-stratification model develop clinically useful format present data support clinical decision-making AIS . Through QI , propose identify optimal mechanism integrate tool within routine flow patient care preparation definitive study , dissemination strategy , improve treatment patient AIS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 : Implement ePRISM RESOLVE Decision Aid ( DA ) 2 site ( Saint Luke 's Hospital Kansas City Saint Luke 's North ) Emergency Department ( ED ) access decision support . 1 . Procedures Evaluation 1 . Map process flow define optimal point care inform consent decision aid . 2 . Pre-implementation registry data retrieval patient/family satisfaction information consent process pre-PRISM , well time presentation treatment . 3 . Implementation ePRISM software RESOLVE DA . 4 . Monitor proportion patient RESOLVE DA use . 5 . Post-implementation registry data retrieval patient/family satisfaction knowledge , well time presentation treatment . 6 . Interviews provider confidence make treatment decision . 7 . Monitor patient outcome 90 day follow phone call per standard care . Specific Aim 2 : Implement ePRISM RESOLVE DA onsite Barnes Jewish Hospital Emergency Department . After optimize integration ePRISM RESOLVE DA Saint Luke 's Hospital Saint Luke 's North , evaluate strategy implementation Barnes Jewish Hospital 's Emergency Department Telestroke Program .</detailed_description>
