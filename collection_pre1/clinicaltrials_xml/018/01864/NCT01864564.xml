	<brief_title>Early Gestational Diabetes Screening Gravid Obese Woman</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Over 1/3 reproductive age woman obese . Obese woman higher rate adverse pregnancy outcome , include stillbirth , fetal growth disorder , diabetes , hypertensive disease maternal death . Although weight loss prior pregnancy ideal , significant proportion obese woman present care conception . Consequently , develop comprehensive plan manage obese gravida imperative . One component plan must include screen treat gestational diabetes ( GDM ) , associate macrosomia , cesarean delivery , preeclampsia , shoulder dystocia , neonatal hypoglycemia . Obesity substantially increase risk GDM ( odds ratio 2-5 ) . GDM treatment show improve pregnancy outcome , obese woman GDM continue worsen outcomes compare normal weight woman GDM , cesarean delivery , preeclampsia , macrosomia stillbirth occur obese woman . This perhaps due pre-existing insulin resistance obese woman , couple normal insulin resistance pregnancy , lead early onset GDM obese woman compare normal weight woman , consequently longer fetal exposure hyperglycemic episode prior diagnosis treatment . The American College Obstetricians Gynecologists recommends screen obese woman gestational diabetes ( GDM ) first trim upon presentation . However , due lack support data , recommendation widely follow majority obese woman undergo GDM screen 24-28 week gestation . Postponing test may delay diagnosis treatment GDM 10 week , result fetal hyperglycemia critical period fetal growth development . Early screening , 14-18 week gestation , high-risk population allow early recognition treatment GDM , thereby improve perinatal outcome . Additionally , little known screen diagnostic standard GDM early pregnancy . Currently , GDM test perform early pregnancy , criterion use diagnose GDM 24-28 week apply . However , threshold develop test perform 24-28 week ; apply threshold 14-18 week may appropriate . As insulin resistance increase throughout pregnancy , lower criterion glucose tolerance test early gestation may improve GDM detection avoid need re-testing late pregnancy . Alternatively , GDM new-onset insulin resistance result hyperglycemia , biomarkers reflect metabolic marker recent hyperglycemic episode may perform well screen GDM may decrease patient burden , increase compliance , glucose tolerance test . One marker evaluate Type 2 diabetes 1,5-anhydroglucitol ( AG ) , unmetabolized monosaccharide . AG fairly stable steady-state concentration blood unaffected fasting , dietary change pregnancy ; reabsorb renal tubule transporter reabsorb glucose . During hyperglycemic episode , presence glucose urine competitively inhibit reabsorption AG , result precipitous decline AG level . AG level recover slowly presence continue hyperglycemia . The rapid fall AG onset hyperglycemia slow recovery situation on-going hyperglycemia suggest sensitive specific marker new-onset glucose intolerance require treatment . As perinatal outcome closely link hyperglycemic excursion , ( 18 ) AG may sensitive specific marker determine GDM patient benefit treatment . This study potentially practice change could greatly reduce disparity perinatal outcomes see obese woman . Early GDM screen obese woman may reduce risk cesarean delivery , macrosomia , stillbirth , preterm birth , preeclampsia population . This study 3 specific aim : Specific Aim 1 : To test hypothesis early GDM screen 14-18 week obese woman ( body mass index ≥30.0 ) result improve composite perinatal outcome . Specific Aim 2 : To test hypothesis lower diagnostic threshold GDM 14-18 week result improve detection GDM reduce need third-trimester testing . Specific Aim 3 : To test hypothesis 1,5-anhydroglucitol , sensitive marker recent hyperglycemic excursion , use simple sensitive serum test GDM obese population .</detailed_description>
