	<detailed_description>Deferred cord clamp appear confer short term benefit term preterm newborn baby . However , optimal timing cord clamping remain unclear , increasingly hypothesise immediate cord clamping may disrupt physiological process . Indeed , difference anatomy physiology baby placenta may lead functional difference potentially alter blood flow newborn . This may implications baby cord clamp early late . A method estimate best time clamp cord could offer short long-term benefit especially preterm population . Many study start measure short-term benefit defer cord clamping reduce requirement ventilation , red cell transfusion , improve perfusion reduce incidence intraventricular haemorrhage . Studies currently underway examine long-term benefit defer cord clamping . However , little know background physiology placental transfusion . Studies often use arbitrary time clamp cord little reference scientific basis . Many study include Cochrane review meta-analysis use variable definition defer cord clamp vary 30 second 5 minute cord stop pulsate . There appear risk associate deferred cord clamping . There report increase need phototherapy treat jaundice consistent . Polycythaemia also report , however , know present proportion term delivery regardless time clamping defer cord clamp appear confer great clinical risk change incidence hypoglycaemia increase need exchange transfusion . In preterm population baby deliver issue relate resuscitation also need address . For example , baby bear 25 week gestation may benefit deferred cord clamp alter time approach resuscitation . A good understanding physiology instance , couple reliable measure majority placental transfusion occur , may guide optimal timing cord clamp initiation resuscitation . Other method assess placental transfusion try study currently ongoing include weigh infant transfusion measure volume speed blood transfusion . However , difficult transfer method preterm population due concern regard thermoregulation need resuscitation . Although number study investigate effect deferred umbilical cord clamp perform little research physiology behind placental transfusion . One study previously use Doppler assess blood velocity umbilical artery although methodology study outdated . This study perform use sound Doppler recording , play via tape continuous spectrograph analyser . With advancement technology use colour Doppler ultrasound possible reliably quickly quantify umbilical cord blood flow therefore eliminate methodological flaw study . A study examine rate placental transfusion although disagreement whether transfusion steady state rapid decrease first minute delivery . There also little discussion whether timing individual foetal-placental unit . As discussed , seem decreased requirement red cell transfusion defer cord clamp confers infant higher haemoglobin concentration . Photoplethysmographic Sensors ( PPG ) use monitor haemodynamic status patient include heart rate , oxygen saturation perfusion . PPG work emit light source tissue reflect measure , fluctuate accord blood flow . The amount light reflect therefore vary accord blood volume hence give assessment haemodynamic status . Assessing whether either Doppler PPG provide feasible method measure umbilical blood flow cessation help guide u clinical practice . Both method involve equipment available use delivery suite , involve minimal handle infant important especially context preterm delivery enable neonatal team continue assessment early management . The added advantage PPG also use monitor heart rate baby first minute life . This provide valuable information relate stability baby placental transfusion . It show neonate undergo defer cord clamp increase haemoglobin level lower requirement inotropic support blood pressure . This improved haemodynamic status may sustain period time . Important marker haemodynamic status include heart rate , blood pressure capillary refill . Assessment marker need carry first day life correlate skin perfusion . STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary Objective : To use Doppler ultrasound and/or PPG improve knowledge physiology defer cord clamp ass use measure majority placental transfusion occur . This may provide quantitative method guide optimal timing cord clamp initiation resuscitation enable extend study preterm infant may great benefit . Secondary Objective : To compare cardiovascular status infant undergo cord clamp different age birth . Measure central peripheral capillary refill time use PPG sensor investigator observation , measure non-invasive blood pressure , record heart rate auscultation , measure haemoglobin haematocrit . STUDY DESIGN This observational study provide feasibility data large trial preterm cohort . The study recruit baby bear 32 week antenatal perinatal risk factor may necessitate need resuscitation beyond normal thermal management delivery room . The study 2 element : Part I . Either , Doppler probe apply umbilical cord measure umbilical blood flow PPG sensor place baby monitor cutaneous perfusion . In case Doppler assessment probe apply manner affect blood flow . Part II . To determine whether deferred cord clamp effect cardiovascular status delivery compare cohort defer cord clamp observational control cohort measure indicator cardiovascular status ( blood pressure , capillary refill time , haemoglobin count ) . We assess capillary refill time use standardised pressure application PPG sensor place centrally peripherally baby . Both pressure lengths blanch variable .</detailed_description>
