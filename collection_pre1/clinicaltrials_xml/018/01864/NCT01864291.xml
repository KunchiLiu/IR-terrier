	<brief_title>Auditory Brainstem Implant ( ABI ) Pediatric Non-Neurofibromatosis Type 2 Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal MEEI Auditory Brainstem Implant ( ABI ) research study find new way improve hear child deaf receive cochlear implant . The ABI surgically place bionic implant convert sound electrical signal directly transmit cochlear nucleus , first auditory center brain . For many year , ABIs improve hearing patient deaf due brain tumor associate genetic syndrome call Neurofibromatosis Type 2 ( NF2 ) . However , number recent study suggest deaf patient NF2 eligible cochlear implant may also benefit placement ABI . These preliminary study suggest non-NF2 `` nontumor '' patient may actually better outcome ABI surgery patient suffer NF2 . Children appear particularly good candidate developmental plasticity many study , outcome favorable child adult . Patients NF2 deaf due abnormality hear nerve inner ear congenital malformation , infection , disease , injury cochlear implant candidate option improve hear case except ABI . Thus , purpose study carefully analyze whether ABI surgery improve hear quality life non-NF2 child base subjective objective measure hear ABI surgery . In particular , plan study ABI outcomes non-NF2 pediatric patient , characterize parameter use device , determine safety profile ABIs patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Prelinguistic hearing loss ( birth5 yr . ; age ABI implantation 18 months5yrs ) : 1 . MRI +/ CT evidence one following : Cochlear nerve deficiency Cochlear aplasia severe hypoplasia Severe inner ear malformation Postmeningitis ossification 2 . When cochlea present patent normally appear cochlear nerve , lack significant benefit CI despite consistent use ( &gt; 6 mo . ) No limited speech perception ability ( limited pattern perception close set testing material use CI ) Lack progress auditory skill development 2 . Postlinguistic hearing loss ( &lt; 18 yr . age ) : 1 . Loss lack benefit appropriate CI without possibility revision contralateral implantation . Examples might include : Postmeningitis ossification Bilateral temporal bone fracture cochlear nerve avulsion Failed revision CI without benefit 2 . Previously develop open set speech perception auditoryoral language skills 3 . No medical contraindication 4 . Willing receive appropriate meningitis vaccination 5 . No limited cognitive/developmental delay would expect interfere child 's ability cooperate test and/or programming device , develop speech oral language , would make implant subsequent emphasis aural/oral communication child 's best interest 6 . Strong family support include language proficiency parent ( ) child 's primary mode communication well write spoken English . 7 . Reasonable expectation parent include thorough understanding : potential benefit limitation ABI parental role rehabilitation child may develop spoken language primary communication mode even sufficient spoken language make significant academic progress aural/oral environment 8 . Involvement educational program emphasize development auditory skill without use supplementary visual communication . 9 . Able comply study requirement include travel investigation sit clinic visit . 10 . Informed consent procedure child 's parent . 1 . Pre postlinguistic child currently make significant progress CI This consider child progress along expect speech reception hierarchy ( SRIQ ) detail Wang et al ( 50 ) . Even young child ( 18 month age 6 month use ) , nearly child good auditory signal CI reach ceiling effect ITMAIS pattern perception beyond chance use ESP ( 50 ) . Moreover , evidence improvement metric time . 2 . MRI evidence one following : normal cochlea cochlear nerve NF2 brainstem cortical anomaly make implantation unfeasible 3 . Clear surgical reason poor CI performance remediate revision CI contralateral surgery rather ABI . 4 . Intractable seizure progressive , deteriorate neurological disorder 5 . Unable participate behavioral test mapping CI . If appear age effect , ABI delay assure child able participate , reliable objective measure map currently available map device . 6 . Lack potential spoken language development . This consider case evidence follow exist : Severe psychomotor retardation , autism , cerebral palsy , developmental delay beyond speech would preclude usage device oral educational development . Autism special case potential delay presentation . When early sign consider present , request comprehensive developmental assessment evaluation prior consider routine evaluation . 7 . Unable tolerate general anesthesia ( cardiac , pulmonary , bleed diathesis , etc. ) . 8 . Need brainstem irradiation 9 . Unrealistic expectation part subject/family regard possible benefit , risk limitation inherent procedure prosthetic device . 10 . Unwilling sign inform consent . 11 . Unwilling make necessary followup appointment .</criteria>
