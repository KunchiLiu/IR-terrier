	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose cyclophosphamide give together ixazomib dexamethasone treat patient previously untreated symptomatic multiple myeloma . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide dexamethasone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Ixazomib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving cyclophosphamide together ixazomib dexamethasone may better treatment multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ixazomib Citrate , Cyclophosphamide , Dexamethasone Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Symptomatic Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose cyclophosphamide combine MLN9708 ( ixazomib ) dexamethasone patient previously untreated symptomatic multiple myeloma ( MM ) . ( Phase I ) II . To determine complete plus good partial response rate ( &gt; = VGPR ) MLN9708 , use combination cyclophosphamide dexamethasone patient previously untreated symptomatic MM . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine progression free survival overall survival among patient previously untreated symptomatic MM follow treatment MLN9708 combination cyclophosphamide dexamethasone follow MLN9708 maintenance till progression . II . To determine toxicity associate MLN9708 combination cyclophosphamide dexamethasone patient previously untreated symptomatic MM . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To examine pharmacokinetics MLN9708 use combination cyclophosphamide dexamethasone . II . To assess incidence neurotoxicity use patient complete questionnaire . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study cyclophosphamide follow phase II study . INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients receive ixazomib orally ( PO ) day 1 , 8 , 15 cyclophosphamide PO dexamethasone PO day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Patients receive ixazomib PO day 1 , 8 , 15 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3-6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
