	<brief_summary>The stroke cerebrovascular disease lead cause permanent neurological disability third death Western world . Their affected often motor sensory disturbance form hemiparesis possible influence balance alter trunk muscle , important component postural control . The treatment stroke , cover wide range different strategy approach physiotherapy , include , specific exercise trunk call `` core stability '' , perform patient help supervision physiotherapist specialize neurology , base coordination , motor proprioceptive work , especially lumbar-pelvic . The effectiveness last year demonstrate empirically , sufficient evidence effect exercise sit balance respect , stand subacute phase post-stroke patient . To prove evidence raise randomize , multicenter , blind evaluator participate analysis process do intention treat . Patients divide two group : control ( usual physiotherapy center make ) experimental ( make also 15 minute workout `` core stability '' ) . The intervention frequency 5 day week 5 week 12 week . The expected effect experimental group patient develop well postural control trunk influence balance sitting , stand walking .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The deterioration balance sit poor sit ability , clinical problem common stroke . These patient show significant decrease performance level trunk , compare healthy individual age sex present asymmetry trunk pelvis . Sitting involve ability achieve variety object arm 's length , personal daily activity , showering , go bathroom dress . These arm movement , trigger postural adjustment muscle trunk low extremity , anticipated movement always precede active movement . This anticipative control alter subject stroke . The trunk seem particularly important balance , stabilize pelvis spine . Dean et al , ( 1997 ; 2007 ) Ibrahimi ( 2010 ) show beneficial effect functional scope practice task , sit variable dynamic sit balance , load weight affect side standing . Also study Howe ( 2005 ) ; Verheyden ( 2009 ) ; Saeys ( 2011 ) ; Karthikbabu ( 2011 ) Kumar ( 2011 ) specific exercise trunk , favorable outcome obtain compare standard treatment . However , study patient without monitoring , need confirm ( study intend )</detailed_description>
