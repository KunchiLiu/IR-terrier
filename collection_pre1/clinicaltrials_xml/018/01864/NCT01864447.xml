	<brief_summary>Patients acute blood clot vein risk leg-related complication pain , swell , immobility . In addition , occurrence blood clot major implication personal health include weight gain , blood clot recurrence impairment cardiovascular functioning . The goal study determine whether aerobic exercise training therapeutic strategy offset risk factor recurrent blood clot leg complication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Exercise Training After Acute Blood Clot</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac rehabilitation ( CR ) , formalize exercise behavioral modification program , cornerstone secondary prevention heart disease . Implementation CR early acute myocardial infarction ( MI ) associate improved cardiac function survival . As , CR standard care majority hospital-based discharge program follow coronary event . In stark contrast , similar program exists follow acute venous thromboembolism ( VTE blood clot ) , despite high rate limb respiratory disability VTE , share risk factor heart disease , know beneficial impact exercise training VTE complication ( e.g . post-thrombotic syndrome , PTS ) . Body weight key modifiable risk factor drive risk incident recurrent VTE . Obese patient prior VTE 2-fold high risk second VTE compare normal weight patient . ( 1 ) Importantly , VTE recurrence risk escalate weight control establish . Weight gain acute DVT common , mean 7 % increase 6 month . ( 2 ) To date , however , limited evidence regard whether early initiation exercise training follow acute DVT safe feasible mitigates weight gain associate VTE diagnosis . Previously , significant decrease body weight fat mass loss demonstrate utilizing high-caloric expenditure exercise CR setting . ( 3 ) Delineating impact high-caloric expenditure exercise induce weight loss reduce VTE complication recurrence critical first step toward evaluate role early post-VTE rehabilitation clinical setting .</detailed_description>
