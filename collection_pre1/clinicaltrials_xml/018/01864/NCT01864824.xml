	<brief_summary>In study , pill formulate used try ameliorate effect air pollution epigenetic change , specifically DNA methylation , potentially link particulate matter air pollution inhalation cardiovascular health effect . The way achieve vitamin , act methyl donor , add methyl group DNA reverse loss observed exposure air pollution . Specifically study , methyl donor supplement make Jamieson Laboratories , consist 50mg Vitamin B6 1 mg Vitamin B12 , ( within Health Canada approve limit ) 2.5 mg folic acid . The non-vitamin ingredient commonly use pill formation . However , folic acid concentration 2.5mg , 1.0mg limit set Health Canada natural health product . This concentration , however , use previous academic study safely effectively , also formulate Jamieson Laboratories . ( ClinicalTrials.gov number , NCT00106886 ; Current Controlled Trials number , ISRCTN14017017 . HOPE2 study ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Air Pollution , Epigenetics Cardiovascular Health : A Human Intervention Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Air pollution pervasive environmental threat estimate cause ~800,000 death every year worldwide , mostly due cardiovascular disease . This proposal address fundamental mechanistic pharmacologic question effect air pollution , effectively address control human exposure experiment : exposure epigenetic effect may downstream subclinical clinical consequence , adverse effect safely reduce pharmacologically ? Consistent evidence in- vitro human study show exposure air particulate matter pollution ( PM , i.e. , fine particle ) induces hypomethylation DNA , epigenetic process underlie activation inflammatory gene postulate link inhalation PM lungs cardiovascular inflammation adverse response . Our goal determine whether pharmacological intervention methyl-donors ( i.e. , folic acid , Vitamins B6 &amp; B12 , betaine , methionine , choline ) avert DNA methylation loss mitigate cardiovascular effect induce PM exposure . The investigator use experiment human control exposure PM - reproduce condition exposure similar find real life urban environment - conduct double-blind , placebo-controlled crossover study . The investigator test whether pharmacological intervention methyl-donors attenuate effect PM exposure DNA methylation ( Aim 1 ) , mRNA expression &amp; plasma cytokine ( Aim 2 ) , blood pressure , arterial vasoconstriction , endothelial function , autonomic control heart ( Aim 3 ) . The investigator ' study poise first human investigation translate wealth animal data show methyl-donors used modulate epigenetic state avert environmental effect . The investigator unique opportunity achieve goal access one facility worldwide human controlled-exposure study , well state-of-the-art resource epigenetics investigation . The investigator examine DNA methylation mRNA expression T-helper cell human individual , cell type key role determine adverse hypertensive endothelial response , show several animal model . The investigator test effect methyl-donors battery cardiovascular endpoint highly sensitive PM exposure . The investigator explore use advanced statistical method mediation analysis understand relationship among PM , DNA methylation , RNA expression , plasma cytokine , cardiovascular endpoint . The study conduct investigative team conduct seminal work research area proposal build upon , include environmental epigenetics , cardiovascular effect PM , human control exposure study .</detailed_description>
