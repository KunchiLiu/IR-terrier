	<brief_title>Combination Metformin With Gefitinib Treat NSCLC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives : To determine 1 year progression-free survival ( PFS ) combination metformin gefitinib patient harbor EGFR-mutant previously untreated advanced metastatic pulmonary adenocarcinoma . Secondary Objectives : A . To evaluate response therapy overall survival combination metformin gefitinib patient harbor EGFR-mutant previously untreated advanced metastatic pulmonary adenocarcinoma . B . To acquire preliminary data regard effect metformin interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) level tumor serum . Treatment administer outpatient basis . Metformin start dose 500 mg twice day , orally meal . After one week , increase dose metformin 1000 mg first dose day 500 mg second dose . After another week , increase 1000 mg metformin two time day . Metformin treatment initiate one week begin gefitinib , possible , gefitinib administration delay metformin loading . Gefitinib administer 250mg QD continuously . Metformin administer continuously , begin one week begin gefitinib , possible , tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) delay metformin loading . Maintenance Therapy Patients respond therapy maintain metformin ( 1000 mg twice daily ) gefitinib . Duration Therapy In absence treatment delay due adverse event , treatment may continue one follow criterion applies : 1 . Disease progression , 2 . Intercurrent illness prevents administration treatment , 3 . Unacceptable adverse event ( ) , 4 . Patient decide withdraw study , 5 . General specific change patient 's condition render patient unacceptable treatment judgment investigator .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients must Histologically cytologically confirm non small cell carcinoma lung harbor EGFRmutation previously untreated Patient must measurable stage IV disease ( include M1a , M1b stag recurrent disease ) ( accord 7th edition tumor node metastasis ( TNM ) classification system ) . However , patient T4NX disease ( stage III B ) nodule ( ) ipsilateral lung lobe eligible , patient include historical control . Patients age &gt; 18 year &lt; 75 year . Patients must Life Expectancy great 12 week . Patients must electrocorticography ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 ( Karnofsky &gt; 70 % ) . Patients must normal organ marrow function define , within one week prior randomization : absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mL platelet &gt; 100,000/mL total bilirubin : within normal institutional limit AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) &lt; 2.5 X institutional upper limit normal creatinine â‰¤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal urine dipstick proteinuria &lt; le 1+ . If urine dipstick &gt; 1+ 24 hour urine protein must demonstrate &lt; 500 mg protein 24 hour allow participation study . Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Patients must international normalize ratio ( INR ) &lt; 1.5 partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) great upper limit normal within 1 week prior randomization . Patients history hypertension must wellcontrolled ( &lt; 150 systolic/ &lt; 100 diastolic ) stable regimen antihypertensive therapy . Patients must ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . Patients uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Patients receive chronic daily treatment aspirin ( &gt; 325 mg/day ) nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent know inhibit platelet function . Treatment dipyridamole ( Persantine ) , ticlopidine ( Ticlid ) , clopidogrel ( Plavix ) and/or cilostazol ( Pletal ) also allow . Patients receive therapeutic anticoagulation . Prophylactic anticoagulation venous access device allow provided Section 3.10 met . Caution take treat patient low dose heparin low molecular weight heparin DVT prophylaxis treatment bevacizumab may increase risk bleeding . Prior use chemotherapy . Patients receive immunotherapy , hormonaltherapy radiotherapy within 2 week prior enter study . Note : Those recovered adverse event due agent administer consider ineligible . Patients receive investigational agent . Patients uncontrolled brain metastasis . Note : Patients brain metastasis must stable neurologic status follow local therapy ( surgery radiation ) least 2 week , must without neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . Patients history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition metformin paclitaxel agent use study exclude . Women pregnant breastfeed Note : Pregnant woman exclude study agent use study may teratogenic fetus . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother paclitaxel , breastfeed woman also exclude study . Patients HIVpositive combination antiretroviral therapy due potential lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy .</criteria>
