	<brief_title>Effects Single OMT Intraocular Pressure ( IOP ) Ocular Hypertenive Glaucoma Suspect Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glaucoma lead cause irreversible blindness United States world . Approximately 2.8 million Americans diagnosed glaucoma . Based pilot study clinical experience PI , power analysis indicate order lower IOP 4 mm Hg 28 subject would need , 14 experimental group 14 control/comparator group . The intervention OMT . Based anatomy eye dysfunction underlie primary open angle glaucoma ( POAG ) , presume mechanisms one combination follow . 1 ) Anatomic : OMT benefit may occur biomechanical restoration drainage trabecular meshwork Schlemm 's canal . 2 ) Neurologic : OMT may affect parasympathetic innervation Edinger-Westphal fiber via cranial nerve III well sympathetic innervation arise T1 T3 level via superior cervical ganglion course eye . The OMT protocol take 25-27 minute administer address cranial , cervical , upper body , spinal sacral structure design affect anatomic , physiologic process ( e.g . lymphatic drainage neck face ) , neurologic structure ( sympathic parasympathetic ) affect visual process . A similar OMT protocol use study healthy elder result improved balance equilibrium . In study adverse outcomes report . The control/comparator subject lay OMT table 25-27 minute time period experimental subject prone , lateral recumbent , supine position .</detailed_description>

Subjects less 18 year old . 5 . Subjects lactate , pregnant , plan become pregnant time plan study . 6 . Subjects history chronic recurrent severe inflammatory eye disease ( e.g. , scleritis , uveitis ) either eye determine patient history and/or examination . 7 . Subjects history clinically significant progressive retinal disease either eye retinal degeneration , diabetic retinopathy , retinal detachment permanent field loss determine patient history and/or examination . 8 . Subjects history serious ocular trauma either eye within past six ( 6 ) month determine patient history and/or examination . 9 . Subjects intraocular surgery either eye within past six ( 6 ) month determine patient history and/or examination . 10 . Subjects ocular laser surgery either eye within past three ( 3 ) month determine patient history and/or examination . 11 . Subjects history ocular infection ocular inflammation either eye within past three ( 3 ) month determine patient history and/or examination . 12 . Subjects abnormality prevent reliable applanation tonometry either eye ( e.g. , keratoconus , corneal conjunctival scar ) . 13 . Subjects abnormality prevent reliable assessment pupil diameter either eye ( e.g. , congenital pupil anomaly , posterior synechiae , anterior cleavage syndrome , afferent defect , prior surgery , etc. ) . 14 . Subjects less thirty ( 30 ) day stable dose regimen Screening Enrollment Visits ( Visits 1 2 ) nonocular medication may affect IOP , administer route use chronic basis .
