	<brief_summary>This prospective , single arm phase IIa trial patient early breast cancer receive pre-operatively two dos denosumab 120mg subcutaneously one week apart ( maximum 12 day ) follow surgery . Tumor , normal breast tissue blood sample collect baseline surgery . Post-operative treatment discretion investigator . Primary objective : determine short course RANKL inhibition denosumab induce decrease tumor proliferation rate determine Ki67 immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) newly diagnose , early stage breast cancer pre-menopausal woman . Secondary objective : - To determine number absolute Ki67 responder short course denosumab ( define &lt; 2.7 % IHC stain post treatment tumor biopsy ) . - To determine effect short course denosumab serum C-terminal telopeptide level ( CTX ) . - To determine effect short course denosumab RANK/RANKL gene expression signal assess immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) gene expression profile tumor . - To determine effect short course denosumab tumor apoptosis rate use IHC - To determine effect short course denosumab modulate immature mammary epithelial cell population tumor . - To determine effect short course denosumab estrogen signal pathway tumor . - To determine effect short course denosumab various immune - To determine effect safety profile denosumab</brief_summary>
