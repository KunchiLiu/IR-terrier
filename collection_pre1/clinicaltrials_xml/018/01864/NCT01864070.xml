	<brief_summary>The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose combination everolimus TheraSphere give patient advanced NETs spread liver . The safety everolimus TheraSphere also study . Everolimus design block protein inside cancer cell , also involved cancer growth . TheraSphere medical device contain radioactive material call yttrium-90 ( Y-90 ) . Tiny glass bead call microspheres fill Y-90 injected artery directly liver . This allow large dose radiation give directly tumor , may lower risk side effect radiation part body and/or healthy liver tissue . The radiation TheraSphere stay body begin lose effect within 12 day . The glass microspheres stay body point . The radiation eventually decay ( go away ) . By time participant leave hospital , amount radiation outside body low enough threat others .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1 TheraSphere + Everolimus With Neuroendocrine Tumors ( NETs ) + Liver Only Liver Dominant Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If patient find eligible take part study , assign dose level everolimus base join study . Up 3 dose level everolimus test . Up 6 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . If intolerable side effect see , dose may lower . This continue high tolerable dose everolimus find . After , 10 additional participant enrol high tolerable dose find . All participant receive dose level TheraSphere . Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 28 day . On Day 1 Cycle 1 , 2 week TheraSphere procedure , patient start take everolimus . Patient take 1-2 tablet everolimus mouth 1 time every day . Patient take everolimus tablet glass water morning time every day . The tablet swallow whole chewed crush . The tablet may take either always always without food . If patient vomit take dose , take another tablet day . It important patient take tablet give study doctor tell miss tablet . If patient forget take one day , take extra dos next day . Instead , patient contact doctor ask advice . On day patient 's study visit , take dose everolimus clinic , home . TheraSphere Administration : About 2 week TheraSphere procedure , patient angiogram . An angiogram imaging test use contrast dye help doctor look body 's blood vessel . Patient give drug vein arm hand help relax , patient stay awake procedure . An area patient 's groin numb anesthetic . During procedure , doctor insert catheter blood vessel patient 's groin lead liver . Dye inject catheter , series x-ray take allow doctor see blood vessel patient 's liver . At end procedure , catheter remove patient 's groin area . The x-rays take look patient 's doctor plan TheraSphere procedure . The angiogram procedure take 1½ 3 hour . On Day 15 Cycle 1 , patient receive TheraSphere . Before procedure , patient give drug vein arm hand help relax , patient stay awake procedure . An area patient 's groin numb anesthetic . Patient may ask study staff information anesthesia drug give risk . The doctor insert catheter blood vessel patient 's groin lead liver . Based plan patient 's angiogram procedure , doctor guide catheter target blood vessel . Once catheter proper blood vessel , TheraSphere microspheres contain Y-90 injected catheter reach tumor liver . After TheraSphere microspheres inject , catheter remove patient 's groin . The entire procedure take 1½ 3 hour . After receive TheraSphere microspheres , patient stay recovery area several hour staff check patient possible side effect . If patient serious side effect , may admit hospital checked treatment , need . Study Visits : Before visit , patient must fast start midnight night . On Day 1 Cycle 1 , test do last 5 day : - Patient physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Patient ask symptom may drug may take . - Patient 's performance status record . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test tumor marker test . - Urine collect routine test . - If patient 's doctor think need , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw check hepatitis B and/or C. On Day 14 15 Cycle 1 : - Patient physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Patient ask side effect may . - Patient 's performance status record . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . On Day 1 Cycles 2 beyond : - Patient physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Patient ask side effect may drug may take . - Patient 's performance status record . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn routine test . On Day 1 Cycles 2 3 every 3-6 week , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw check hepatitis B and/or C doctor think need . On Day 1 Cycles 2 , 4 , every 3 cycle , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw tumor marker test additional routine test . On Day 1 Cycles 4 beyond , urine collect routine test . On Day 1 Cycle 4 every 3 cycle , patient CT scan , MRI , and/or x-ray check status disease . Length Dosing : Patient receive TheraSphere Day 15 Cycle 1 may continue take everolimus 12 cycle , long doctor think patient 's best interest . Patient longer able take everolimus disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Patient 's participation study complete follow-up . End-of-Dosing Visit : Within 1 week patient stop take study drug , follow test procedure perform . Patient must fast start midnight night visit . - Patient physical exam , include measurement weight vital sign . - Patient ask side effect may . - Patient 's performance status record . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test tumor marker test . This blood draw include pregnancy test patient become pregnant . - Urine collect routine test . - Patient CT scan , MRI , and/or x-ray check status disease . Follow-up : At least 1 time week phone clinic 30 day patient 's last everolimus dose , study staff follow patient . Patient ask side effect may . The call last 10-15 minute . If patient leave study side effect , continue contact study staff side effect go away become stable . This investigational study . Everolimus commercially available FDA approve treat advance pancreatic NETs type cancer . The combination everolimus TheraSphere study investigational . TheraSphere commercially available FDA approve radiation treatment liver cancer . The use TheraSphere study investigational . Up 22 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
