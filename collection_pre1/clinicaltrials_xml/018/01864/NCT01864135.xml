	<brief_summary>Prostate cancer common cancer men Finland last ten year . Prostate-specific antigen ( PSA ) play important role screen prostate cancer . However , PSA limit sensitivity specificity prostate cancer detection . Commonly , diagnosis prostate cancer do transrectal ultrasonography ( TRUS ) guide biopsy . Due low accuracy TRUS , systematic biopsy usually perform instead target TRUS biopsy . As biopsy carry risk increase complication , increase interest develop accurate non-invasive imaging modality . This study enroll 150 men clinical suspicion prostate cancer due high serum level PSA 2.5 ng/ml and/or abnormal digital rectal examination . Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging ( mpMRI ) 3 Tesla ( T ) magnetic field use surface coil use non-invasively predict presence absence prostate cancer . Targeted TRUS guide biopsy base MRI finding perform addition routine twelve core TRUS biopsy . Moreover , select serum urine biomarkers well biomarkers extract fresh biopsy sample collect correlated presence absence prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
