	<brief_summary>With increase rate obesity number anti-obesity operation perform increase ; one common gastric bypass . Anti-obesity surgery ameliorate diabetes several serious comorbidities , bariatric surgery also associate medical nutritional complication . Post-gastric bypass hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia relative rare serious complication often see month year gastric bypass surgery . The patient experience neuroglycopenic symptom ( eg . inability concentrate , weakness , alter mental status , loss consciousness ) . The purpose study determine whether glucagon-like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) enteropancreatic factor ( eg . gastric empty rate ) responsible excessed insulin secretion see patient bariatric surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Etiology , Assessment Treatment Post-gastric Bypass Severe Hypoglycemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The increase prevalence obesity lead parallel increase bariatric surgery . Sustained weight reduction 50 % excess body weight achieved majority patient , bariatric surgery effective produce sustained weight loss . Another remarkable effect bariatric surgery , especially Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) , profound durable resolution clinical manifestation type 2 diabetes . Despite favorable effect bariatric surgery obesity-associated morbidity mortality , mount concern severe hypoglycemia associate Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery . This increasingly recognize condition characterize neuroglycopenia inappropriately elevated insulin concentration . The patient experience autonomic symptom tremor , palpitation , sweat hunger , symptom neuroglycopenia inability concentrate , weakness , drowsiness behavioral change . One issue complicate characterization post-gastric bypass surgery patient undergo bariatric surgery typically experience numerous post-prandial symptom include `` dumping syndrome '' , may part continuum post-gastric bypass hypoglycemia . We know affected individual exaggerated insulin glucagon-like peptide-1 response meal consumption compare asymptomatic individual prior gastric bypass surgery . Ten patient recurrent hypoglycemia event , include presence Whipple 's triad , follow gastric bypass surgery participate study . Ten asymptomatic subject previous gastric bypass surgery 10 control subject normal glucose tolerance prior gastrointestinal surgery recruit . Ten subject prior sleeve-gastrectomi also participate order see operation beneficial avoid post-gastric bypass hypoglycemia . Pre- postprandial hormone level insulin secretion rate response 50 mg oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) , isoglycemic intravenous glucose infusion ( IIGI ) 300 kcal liquid mixed meal measure 3 different day separate interval least 1 week . These test perform see response intravenous versus per oral glucose stimulation differ four different group regard biomedical marker symptom hypoglycemia . All participant wear Continuous Glucose Monitoring ( CGM ) least 5 day . During period time subject ask come laboratory two separate day receive high-carbohydrate meal low-carbohydrate meal respectively . The ingestion follow three hour blood glucose measurement along CGM . The purpose test see different response glucose depend composition meal ingest , see whether CGM reliably especially measure low level glucose . The subject recurrent hypoglycemia event follow gastric bypass surgery receive liquid mixed meal three time separate least one week ; first describe earlier without receive drug afterwards receive either Exendin 9-39 ( specific GLP-1 receptor antagonist ) Octreotid ( Somatostatin analog ) . The purpose test test hypothesis gastric bypass surgery associate hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia mediate increased GLP-1 action . Furthermore use somatostatin analog test whether inhibition gastroenteropancreatic hormone delay gastric empty solid change glucose-insulin metabolism . To evaluate impact pharmacologically intervention gastric empty rate use acetaminophen absorption test . Aim : 1 . Is GLP-1 gastroenteropancreatic hormone pathophysiologically involved development post-gastric bypass hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia ? 2 . To investigate whether CGM use diagnose hypoglycemia gastric bypass surgery ? 3 . Which nutritional pharmacological option manage treatment condition ?</detailed_description>
