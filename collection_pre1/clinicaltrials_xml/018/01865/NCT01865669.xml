	<brief_summary>Women advance maternal age morbid obesity , high incidence labor induction/ augmentation cesarean section ( CS ) , great risk postpartum hemorrhage ( PPH ) . Oxytocin first line drug treatment PPH , however , oxytocin receptor ( OTR ) desensitization recognize context prolong labor secondary either endogenous exogenous oxytocin exposure . It unknown oxytocin desensitization specifically affect contractility woman advance maternal age morbid obesity compare young normal weight population . Further know high incidence PPH see woman due poor uterine contractility and/or poor response oxytocin . The investigator hypothesize woman advance maternal age morbid obesity exhibit poor myometrial contractility compare woman young normal body habitus , oxytocin pre-treated untreated myometrium .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In view grow concern rise incidence later maternal age morbid obesity obstetric population , scientific evidence pregnancy outcomes patient timely important . The investigator ' previously validate in-vitro model provide solid foundation study myometrial contractility control condition , without confounders could encounter clinical setting . It also likely provide in-depth understanding parameter investigator feel responsible high incidence PPH patient . The investigator ' study form basis future modification oxytocin augmentation regimen pharmacotherapy control PPH patient population .</detailed_description>
