	<detailed_description>Weight loss loss lean body mass common associate adverse outcome loss strength , reduce immune- pulmonary function increase disability advanced cancer . Progressive weight loss interfere cancer therapy responsible reduce quality life ( QoL ) well short survival irrespective tumour mass presence metastasis . Weight loss advance cancer regard major clinical challenge serious consequence , vary aetiology contribution multiple pathophysiological mechanism poorly disentangle . The main contributor weight loss advance cancer consider development cancer cachexia . The term refer syndrome progressive loss body weight muscle atrophy involve two parallel pathway , i.e . negative energy balance inflammation-driven catabolism . The negative energy balance may direct result malnutrition cause cancer treatment relate symptom interfere food intake routine assessment nutritional status therefore advocate . The interaction relative contribution pathway development cancer cachexia , however , poorly understood . Through novel use traditional clinical data biological marker , propose investigate interplay magnitude process involve development cancer cachexia . This contribute new understanding may lead precise identification remediable factor improve treatment . In context , also investigate relevance use screening tool nutritional status , advocate Norwegian Health Authorities . However , advance cancer identify ability recommend screening tool poorly document . The present study part large project group . The overall project include two parallel study base comprehensive data collection , target patient non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Tumours lung one common cause cancer related weight loss . These patient therefore ideal target study mechanisms impact nutritional problem cachexia , propose present study . The parallel study , approve Regional Committee Medical Health Research Ethics ( REC ) , Region South East ( 2012/830 ) , aim describe frequency development weight loss NSCLC patient , relation tumour stage , response side effect chemotherapy . This study also make part large research effort focus cachexia change body composition cancer patient group . A study impact sarcopenia ( severe muscle loss ) NSCLC ongoing well prospective study cachexia pancreatic cancer , use assessment present study . The present study significantly contribute understanding mechanism weight loss cachexia advance cancer general NSCLC particular , provide knowledge need improve medical treatment follow-up large group patient . Thus , study line research strategy South-Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority ( South-Eastern Norway RHA ) . Furthermore , study emerges multidisciplinary research network represent several area medical nutritional expertise establish international partnership .</detailed_description>
