	<brief_summary>The aim study compare hemodynamic response tracheal intubation use standard technique versus alternative GS intubation technique . As secondary outcome investigator analyze procedure time , success rate injury rate . The investigator hypothesize alternative intubation technique short procedure time low injury rate compare standard technique GS intubation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparison Two GlideScope Intubation Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A Difficult intubation still one daunting challenge anesthesiology . One tool use assist difficult tracheal intubation GlideScope ( GS ) ( Verathon , Bothell , WA , USA ) . The GS video laryngoscope 60 degree angle blade built-in high-resolution camera light source assemble beside . The image transmit onto mobile bedside monitor . It widely use medicine decade . The GS design provide improve view glottis difficult intubation without alignment oral , pharyngeal tracheal ax , able `` look around corner '' facilitate intubation . The standard technique GS intubation involve midline laryngoscopy follow insertion styleted endotracheal tube ( ETT ) adequate view vocal cord achieve . The ETT insertion process require operator look away monitor laryngoscopy maintain blade position order insert initial position . An alternative GS intubation technique describe case limited mouth opening , big tongue anatomical impediment . In case ETT insert direct vision `` fish hook '' side mouth GS blade introduce oropharynx . There several advantage alternative technique . The first advantage technique ETT insertion would minimize laryngoscopy time part perform blade introduce stimulating effect occur . This technique thus potential reduce sympathetic response . Minimizing oropharyngo-laryngeal stimulation time would theoretically attenuate hemodynamic response .</detailed_description>
