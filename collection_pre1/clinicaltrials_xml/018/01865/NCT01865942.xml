	<brief_summary>The investigator wish evaluate effect minimal access spinal surgery compare traditional open surgery spinal surgery patient metastatic spinal cord compression . Minimal access surgery show bee less damaging tissue compare traditional open surgery also cause few wound complication , investigator expect could impact vulnerable patient group like patient metastatic spinal cord compression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Surgical Spinal Decompression Metastatic Spinal Cord Compression , Minimal Access Versus Open Surgery . A Randomized Clinical Trial Purpose To investigate effect minimal access spine surgery ( MASS ) compare conventional open surgery treatment patient metastatic spinalcord compression ( MSCC ) . Hypotheses The group patient 's receive MASS well improvement quality surgery compare group receive traditional open surgery . The MASS patient group reduction per-operative bleeding less wound complication need surgical revision compere group patient receive open traditional surgery . Primary outcome Perioperative bleeding . Secondary outcome Quality life incidence revision surgery . Material method A randomise control trial 1-year follow conduct . Sample size From previous study base patient file calculate mean blood loss open surgery 1500 ml ( standard deviation 750 ml ) . A clinical relevant reduction blood loss 400 ml correspond one unit pack red blood cell . With significance level 5 % power 80 % total 62 patient include study . Most study use QLQ-C30 measurement health relate quality life ( HRQL ) randomize comparison treatment modality cancer patient include 100 200 patient . This include study QLQ-C30 EQ-5D use . EQ-5D widely use generic measurement HRQL . 62 patient randomly allocate receive either minimal invasive open surgery . Inclusion criteria patient spinal metastasis level Th5-L3 candidate surgery . Exclusion criterion : Tokuhashi score â‰¤ 4 , preoperative presumption something else pedicle screw would need , potentially need sacral iliosacral instrumentation , patient need radical treatment . The QLQ-C30 ( Quality Life Cancer ) assess since instrument especially develop use cancer patient use clinical measure . Outcome measure bleed record operation . Outcome measure quality life estimate QLQ-C30 , EQ-5D VAS-pain score . This recorded operation , time discharge , 6 week 3 , 6 12 month operation . Records wound complication lead intervention revision-surgery , antibiotic procedure register follow time .</detailed_description>
