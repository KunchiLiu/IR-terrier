	<brief_summary>This trial conduct Europe . The aim trial compare different ratio explorative formulation , similar propose commercial formulation , IDegAsp ( co-formulation insulin degludec/insulin aspart insulin aspart ) separately inject , simultaneous dos insulin degludec ( insulin 454 ) , insulin aspart , compare biphasic insulin aspart 30 male subject type 1 type 2 diabetes mellitus . Trial part 1 five-period cross-over trial incomplete block-design subject type 1 diabetes subject randomise five ten possible treatment . Each treatment consist injection insulin product follow euglycemic clamp washout period 7-15 day treatment . Trial part 2 three-period cross-over trial complete blockdesign subject type 2 diabetes . Each treatment consist injection insulin product follow euglycaemic clamp washout period 7-15 day treatment .</brief_summary>
