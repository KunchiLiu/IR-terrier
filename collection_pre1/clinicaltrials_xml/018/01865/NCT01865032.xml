	<brief_summary>This study single-site trial assess specificity CL Detect™ Rapid Test versus gold standard Leishmania diagnosis US microscopic identification Leishmania amastigotes stain lesion sample . Subjects patient present dermatology consultation primarily ulcerated lesion . After informed consent obtain subject screen eligibility , 2 diagnostic sample collect subject 's lesion follow order : 1 ) one sample obtain dental broach use CL Detect™ Rapid Test 2 ) second sample obtain scrap use microscopic identification amastigotes . Samples analyze microscopy CL Detect™ Rapid Test . The CL Detect™ Rapid Test perform different operator clinical staff member . These staff member , blind 's result , evaluate sample method independently . Each 150 study subject follow administratively point diagnosis establish ( possible ) test lesion , even diagnosis cutaneous leishmaniasis ( CL ) . If specific diagnosis determine non-CL lesion , investigator assign `` likely etiology '' ( eg , infectious , oncological , immunological , vascular , `` undetermined/other '' origin ) . Based diagnosis determine lesion , subject refer appropriate treatment .</brief_summary>
