	<detailed_description>The dietary restriction proteins sodium cornerstone treatment chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) metabolic consequence . In fact , reduce protein intake decrease load remain nephron , reduces sign symptom uraemia , lessen accumulation waste metabolic product oxidant stress , improve insulin-resistance lipid profile , ameliorate proteinuria , additive effect angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor , decrease likelihood patient death delay initiation dialysis 40 % . Dietary adjustment subject chronic renal failure complex multiple nutrient modification require change lifestyle must maintain year . Furthermore , low-protein diet consider tedious , unpalatable difficult achieve . This obvious negative influence quality life patient make adherence new therapeutic prescription difficult . In fact , difficulty reach patient ' compliance well know . There ample evidence poor adherence consider critical barrier treatment success remain one leading challenge healthcare professional . Few data available clinical practice concern patient ' compliance low protein diet . A dietary interview method validate instrument evaluate practice routine relate assessment nutrient intake nondialyzed CKD patient obtain patient ' compliance . However , interview require presence dedicate dietitian lot time . For reason , absence dedicate dietitian many nephrology centre , usual practice give standard low protein diet CKD patient dialysis . Aim study verify simple tip able reduce protein , phosphate sodium intake patient CKD , compare practice give low protein diet elaborate renal dietitian .</detailed_description>
