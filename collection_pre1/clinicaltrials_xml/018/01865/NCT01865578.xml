	<brief_summary>Patients suffer anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis show impair NMDA-receptor dependent neuronal transmission . Furthermore , often cognitive deficit different magnitude . Impaired neuronal signal NMDA-receptors likely result decrease cortical synaptic plasticity . Thus , represent one major reason cognitive deficit . Synaptic plasticity assess human via non-invasive technique transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . The current study aim investigate whether learn ability also cortical plasticity change apply session transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) . Therefore , recruit 10 15 patient suffer anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis well healthy control order compare tDCS effect . Learning ability assess motor sequence task , whereas cortical plasticity measure via TMS . tDCS novel non-invasive technique allow induction change cerebral excitability level also cortical plasticity . Previous study show positive outcome anodal stimulation learn task . Especially motor learn seem important target tDCS treatment since show best result post-stroke patient healthy subject . Multiple session tDCS induce long-term effect improve learning function , present three month stimulation . In study hope reveals new insight pathomechanisms impair cognitive learning ability patient anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis . Moreover , evaluate whether tDCS effective treatment patient cognitive learn deficit .</brief_summary>
