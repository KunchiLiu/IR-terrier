	<brief_summary>This pilot study design compare tolerance ionic iron ( ferrous sulphate ) heme iron polypeptide . Subjects take one week one product follow week product follow week product . Subjects complete daily diary assess side effect . Hypothesis : Heme iron polypeptide associate few gastrointestinal side effect ionic iron .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Pilot Study Comparing Tolerance Oral Heme Iron Polypeptide With Oral Ionic Iron</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Iron deficiency anemia ( IDA ) worldwide problem child adult . Traditional ionic oral iron supplement many disadvantage include high gastrointestinal side effect , poor variable absorption , poor compliance , potential overdose , especially child . Proferrin currently available form heme iron polypeptide ( HIP ) . It different old traditional iron formulation , ferrous sulphate , heme iron oppose ionic iron . The porphyrin ring heme allow iron absorb different receptor ionic iron result different absorption kinetics GI side effect profile . The absorption HIP via mechanism dietary iron contain meat . Therefore , heme iron therapy may avoid several problem associate ionic iron therapy gastrointestinal side effect absorption dependent food intake . 30 subject enrol , randomize start one study drug , cross , subject single cohort . This open label randomize pilot study intend test feasibility collect information drug tolerance . The randomization stratify age , gender hemoglobin . An optional baseline blood test drawn ( CBC , iron profile , ferritin ) . If subject decide participate optional blood draw , return week take either study medication test . For subject participate optional blood test need return clinic another reason , subject contact phone ( person return clinic another reason ) week take either medication address concern issue . If agree participate blood test , allow send empty pill bottle diary mail contact phone make sure problem study . If participate optional blood test , within one month take final pill , subject return clinic return medication container study diary .</detailed_description>
