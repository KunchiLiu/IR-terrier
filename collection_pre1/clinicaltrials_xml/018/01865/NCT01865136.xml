The sample size calculate objective show two-sided equivalence , assume overall complication rate could high 4-5 percent would apply types provider . To demonstrate two-sided equivalence within margin 4-5 percent 80 % power use 95 % CI ( Î±=0.05 ) , 816 woman would need recruit . In addition , 10 percent could expect lost follow adjust . Thus , total 880 woman recruit . The randomization conduct block 8 vary randomly . A computer random number generator use generate list code 1 880 code link one two group - A= PAC care misoprostol midwife B= PAC care misoprostol physician . The list use sequentially numbered , opaque , seal envelope prepare research team . Each envelope contain study protocol individual woman . At time allocation , research assistant clinic pick envelope low number , write participant 's name personal registration number , open .
