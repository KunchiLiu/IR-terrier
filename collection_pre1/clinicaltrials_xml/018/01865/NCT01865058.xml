	<brief_summary>Non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) one frequent cancer western world approx . 800 new case annually Denmark . Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) Denmark account almost 40 % newly diagnose NHL case . Treatment combination chemotherapy monoclonal antibody significantly improve prognosis past decade , large proportion patient DLBCL continue relapse current treatment option . Therefore , need reliable method detection treatment response early possible treatment course order identify patient respond poorly standard treatment potentially would benefit change treatment strategy . This still establish , valid early marker require order allow randomize trial treatment stratify early response . One promising application PET metabolic assessment early response cancer treatment . This study national prospective multicenter study emanate Danish Lymphoma Group ( DLG ) . Patients scan early 4 cycle chemo therapy . The aim establish correct time response evaluation . Additionally , investigator wish investigate optimal qualitative quantitative method response assessment order predict post-therapeutic remission long-term prognosis.This study contribute interim-PET implement optimal way daily clinical practice .</brief_summary>
