By identify psychological health concern may threaten successful treatment outcomes high-risk patient group recognize early , turn may help reduce postoperative weight regain complication . To best PI 's knowledge , propose work would first study kind Arab world .

	<detailed_description>Obesity become global epidemic cause enormous human economic cost . According World Health Organization 2011 overweight obesity represent fifth lead risk death globally , 2.8 million adult die year result excess weight . Worldwide , estimate overweight obesity reach 1.5 billion 500 million respectively . In addition overall increase mortality among population , large body evidence show excess weight link several chronic illness include cardiovascular disease ( e.g . stroke ) , diabetes mellitus ( type 2 ) , certain cancer ( e.g . breast colon cancer ) osteoarthritis . Furthermore , obesity inflicts major economic loss . Past research confirm obesity associate higher medical expenditure due great usage medical service also increase non-medical cost , example due absenteeism work . While continuous rise overweight obesity major concern globally , reach particular urgency MENA region prevalence rate condition rise alarm level . For example , two recent systematic literature review focus Arabian Gulf States report overweight obesity rate 25 48 % 13 49 % respectively across six country . UAE-specific data show obesity rate range 26 47 % . Additionally , author identify UAE Gulf state high hypertension diabetes rate . In fact , 2011 UAE diabetes figure 19 % confirm one high world . When look MENA country outside Gulf , high obesity rate report Syria Jordan ( 38 % 35 % , respectively ) . In order tackle increase burden obesity , effective intervention prevention approach require . While behavioral pharmacological treatment ( e.g . low calorie diet , exercise , medication ) successful mean overcome overweight mild obesity , case severe obesity usually fail respond intervention . Instead , radical measure bariatric surgery typically need achieve substantial weight loss . Past research show patient lose significant amount weight surgery . However , weight loss maintenance remain problematic weight regain adjustment difficulty ( e.g . adapt healthy eating behavior ) common . Yet , little know risk factor may trigger weight relapse . Previous research context point toward high level mental health problem among obese individual include bariatric surgery patient . Affective , anxiety eat disorder ( particular binge eat symptom ) commonly report prevalence rate reach 84 % . However , impact preoperative psychopathology actual surgery outcomes well understood . Results remain inconsistent research need determine whether psychological factor jeopardize successful surgery outcomes . Another important question regard whether postoperative intervention focus patient ' psychological health helpful sustain achieved weight loss cop postoperative adjustment difficulty . Until , empirical study address question . Findings far indicate positive impact postoperative counseling patient ' weight management overall well-being . However , small sample size , difference study methodology ( e.g . qualitative vs. quantitative ) , diversity therapeutic intervention provide impede firm conclusion . In addition uncertainty , important recognize research field bariatric surgery mental health almost entirely restricted Western country . Despite repeated search several database ( e.g . PsycInfo , Academic Search Premier , Medline ) examination bibliography relevant paper match study MENA country could find . This lack regional data major concern give difficulty generalize finding cross-culturally one hand high obesity rate part world . MENA-based research field would yield vital insight policy maker , commissioner practitioner management delivery evidence-based best-practice patient-oriented care . Therefore , propose study aim : 1 . Examine psychological health bariatric surgery among obese patient UAE Jordan 2 . Investigate impact patient ' psychological health postoperative weight loss , 3 . Assess efficacy group-based counseling improve patient outcome ( i.e . weight loss psychological health ) bariatric surgery The study hypotheses follow : 1 . Participants high level psychological health problem surgery lose less weight ( % ) first 12 month surgery patient low level psychological health problem . 2 . Participants receive postoperative counseling addition standard treatment lose weight ( % ) first 12 month surgery patient provide standard treatment . 3 . Participants receive postoperative counseling addition standard treatment show less psychological health problem 12 month surgery patient provide standard treatment .</detailed_description>
