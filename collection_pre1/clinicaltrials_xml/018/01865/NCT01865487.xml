	<detailed_description>This Phase I/IIa , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , dose- regimen-finding study healthy adult without latent Tuberculosis ( TB ) Infection , BCG-vaccinated , HIV negative , history evidence TB disease . The investigational product AERAS-456 3 dose level : 5 , 15 , 50ug H56 antigen 500 nmol IC31 . The vaccine administer IM injection . The study conduct two site South Africa . A total 98 subject enrol 2 phase 4 group base LTBI status . The initial phase dose range study 2-dose regimen 3 dosage level LTBI ( - ) subject , select dosage second phase . In second phase , study expand evaluate 2-dose 3-dose regimen include LTBI ( + ) subject . In first phase , 50 LTBI ( - ) subject enrol Group 1 randomize ratio 3:3:3:1 receive 2 dos 5/500 , 15/500 , 50/500 AERAS-456 , placebo give Study Days 0 56 ( Table 0 1 ) . One dose level AERAS-456 select sponsor SSI second phase study , base analysis unblinded safety immunogenicity data 28 day second dose first phase , conjunction safety immunogenicity data study C-032-456 . The criteria dose-selection specify statistical analysis plan finalize prior unblinded review . The select dose , conjunction unblinded safety immunogenicity data , submit SMC review . In second phase , 48 subject enrol concurrently Group 2 ( LTBI [ - ] ) Groups 3 4 ( LTBI [ + ] , Table 0 2 ) . In Groups 2 4 , 16 subject randomize ratio 3:1 receive 3 dos AERAS-456 placebo give Study Days 0 , 56 , 112 . In Group 3 , 16 subject randomize ratio 3:1 receive 2 dos AERAS-456 placebo give Study Days 0 56 . All subject stay study 292 day receive first vaccination . The subject Groups 1 3 follow 236 day second vaccination subject Groups 2 4 follow 180 day third vaccination . The sample size study cohort select judged adequate preliminary safety immunogenicity evaluation Phase I/IIa study rather statistical reason . Given 12 15 subject individual AERAS-456 dosing group , study 80 % probability detect least 1 specified event occur rate 12.5 % 10.0 % , respectively . If event observe among 12 15 subject receive active study vaccine , approximation upper one-sided 95 % confidence bound rate occurrence event would 22 % 18 % , respectively .</detailed_description>
