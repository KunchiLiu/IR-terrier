	<brief_summary>The investigator intend determine role Seprafilm , popular anti-adhesive agent minimise internal adhesion formation neck thyroid surgery therefore reduce swallow discomfort experience patient surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Into Effect Seprafilm Open Total Thyroidectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thyroid surgery constitute one main pillar treatment thyroid cancer , also employ management symptomatic goitre . Occasionally , mandate patient thyrotoxicosis refractory medical therapy . While thyroid surgery perform low risk patient rarely stay beyond three day hospital , track record thyroid surgery somewhat blemish unfortunate side effect associate neck scar thyroid surgery . Not uncommonly , patient experience discomfort neck region thyroid surgery ; extreme case , patient may even complain lifelong pull sensation neck area eating . The anti-adhesive property Seprafilm well establish animal study affirm clinical observation abdominal surgery utilize material . Thus , Seprafilm routinely use instance surgeon foresees need perform abdominal surgery patient future , fashion temporary stoma . The safety profile Seprafilm thyroidectomy also show recent study conduct group clinician Seoul . We postulate application Seprafilm surgical wound towards end thyroidectomy significantly reduce internal adhesion formation neck region . By achieve objective , hope improve patient ' satisfaction thyroid surgery term ease swallow surgery .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Age 2175 Histological confirmation differentiate thyroid cancer require surgery , symptomatic goiter , thyroid nodule require histological analysis , thyrotoxicosis poorly control medication . Undergoing total thyroidectomy Previous neck surgery Previous neck radiotherapy Patients known history keloid Patients known history motility disorder upper gastrointestinal tract preexist swallow difficulty . Patients metastatic disease ; patient disease would require postop radiation therapy , radionuclide iodine therapy adjuvant therapy . Patients advanced disease would require radical modify neck dissection Patients lobe large 10 cm , nodule large 8 cm require extensive dissection may confound study Patients connective tissue diseases chronic disease longterm medication may interfere wound healing steroid</criteria>
