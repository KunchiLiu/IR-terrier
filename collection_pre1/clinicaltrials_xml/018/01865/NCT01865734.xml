	<brief_summary>Plantar heel pain ( PHP ) one common foot condition podiatry physical therapy practice often associate chronic symptom , disability . Persistence symptom add economic burden PHP cost-effective solution need reduce burden . Currently , wide variation treatment , cost , outcomes care PHP . Two practice guideline available direct management pattern , guideline recent evidence PHP intervention unclear time influence physical therapy multidisciplinary management PHP . The purpose investigation compare outcomes cost associate early physical therapy ( ePT ) follow initial presentation podiatry versus usual podiatric care ( uPOD ) individual PHP . It hypothesize great improvement and/or reduce cost associate either ePT uPOD . In study , 112 individual PHP randomize receive uPOD ePT initial visit podiatrist . Treatment provide uPOD group reflect usual management pattern intervention determine podiatrist . Treatment provide ePT group determine physical therapist focus impairment-based manual therapy exercise lower half body . In addition , evidence-based pain modulate modality integrate ePT treatment . Comparisons make group Foot Ankle Ability measure ( FAAM ) , European Quality Life ( EQ-5D ) , Numeric Pain Rating Scale ( NPRS ) , Global Rating Change ( GROC ) , cost treatment 6 , 26 , 52 , week . The association successful outcome base GROC score patient expectation physical therapy podiatry , general expectation symptom improvement analyze . The result investigation help determine impact ePT inform practice , update exist guideline reduce practice variation , identify cost effective treatment patient PHP .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This investigation randomize clinical trial compare participant-reported outcome cost-effectiveness ePT uPOD follow extend 1 year . Following eligibility screen completion study questionnaires participant randomize use conceal envelope proceed intervention assign group . Outcomes collect 6 week , 6 month , 1 year initial presentation . All outcomes complete patient without influence investigator aware group assignment . Data entry processing occur investigator blind group allocation . A small financial incentive provide facilitate completion outcome measure study duration . Statistical Analysis : Baseline group variable summarize use mean standard deviation continuous measure percentages categorical measure . Independent t-tests ( p &lt; 0.05 , two-tailed ) appropriate nonparametric test use compare group difference baseline characteristic . Parametric test assumption analyze continuous variable visual inspection histogram , use skewness score within double standard error skewness criterion , Levene 's test homogeneity variance . A repeated measure analysis variance use compare group difference FAAM , NPRS , EQ-5D , number office visit associate treatment time point . Results report group mean , mean difference group , 95 % confidence interval , f-value , p-value , power , effect size . The chi-square test use compare GROC score group time point result report chi-square value , p-value , frequency per category . The type treatment base Current Procedural Terminology ( CPT ) Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System ( HCPS ) cod provided per group report percentage . Analysis covariance use group difference observe participant characteristic . Intention treat analysis perform compare complete case analysis multiple imputation analysis . Multiple impute data set generate use Multivariate Imputation Chained Equations algorithm SPSS 19.0 Windows ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) . Multinomial logistic regression use obtain pooled regression estimate data set use analysis . Post-randomization exclusion include participant meet eligibility criterion receive intervention consider exclusion analysis independent , blind adjudication committee evaluate randomized participant . Any cross-overs analyze original group assign compare analysis exclude cross-overs . Participant expectation preference ePT uPOD categorize 3 category ; match , unmatched neutral . Participants label 'matched ' allocate group express high expectation benefit . A high expectation denote comparison visual analog rating group ( ePT uPOD ) . Unmatched participant allocate treatment group low expectation benefit . Neutral participant indicate level expectation treatment . Similar categorization make participant preference base upon response treatment preference question . General expectation improvement dichotomize meet unmet base upon ranking 6 week , 6 month , 1 year follow-up relative baseline ranking . Participants demonstrate 6 week , 6 month , 1 year rank equal high baseline consider meet global expectation improvement . Participants demonstrate ranking baseline expectation consider unmet global expectation improvement . A chi-square test independence use compare proportion individual matched/unmatched/neutral expectation preference global expectation ( meet unmet ) . In addition , difference expectation preference category analyze relative treatment success use chi-square test independence . Treatment success determine GROC time period success define GROC +5 , `` great deal well , '' great . Power Analysis : Sample size estimate calculate base primary outcome measure , FAAM , 6 month . In absence research compare physical therapy podiatry intervention podiatry intervention use FAAM outcome measure , sample size calculation base achieve clinically meaningful difference group detail recent clinical trial Cleland et al use similar method investigation . Sample size estimate make use G*Power 3.1.5 base detect difference group great minimal clinically important difference ( MCID ; ie , 9 point change ) FAAM 6 month alpha level 0.05 , 80 % power , pool sample variance 14.5 Cleland et al This result effect size 0.62 42 participant need per group . This estimate similar effect size 0.69 achieve Cleland et al study 27 subject per 2 treatment group . To account participant drop-in drop-out treatment , addition possibility participant return FAAM questionnaire , sample increase 33 % result 56 participant per group . This estimate conservative relative 3 % drop-out rate 7 % rate individual return outcome form 6 month follow-up Cleland et al investigation . Significant effort make retain subject include financial incentive follow-up research assistant assure completion return outcome form . The focus , consequently power analysis , investigation functional outcome ( base FAAM score ) therefore may result underpowered analysis secondary variable .</detailed_description>
