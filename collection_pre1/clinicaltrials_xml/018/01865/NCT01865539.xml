	<brief_title>Efficacy Foot Orthotics Veterans With Chronic Lower Back Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 : Utilizing gold standard sham control randomized trial design , evaluate change pain , back related disability quality life Veterans CLBP utilize either custom foot orthotic sham orthotic . As part aim investigator build team strength recruit enrol Veteran 's CLBP randomize trial . The investigator collect baseline pain disability measure utilize validated tool . Once patient enrol , utilize `` gold standard '' placebo control design investigator randomize patient receive either custom foot orthotic sham orthotic . The Veterans assess 5 , 12 24-weeks post baseline evaluate difference pain disability . Based previous study effectiveness custom foot orthotics investigator hypothesize Veteran 's receive custom orthotic experience less pain disability compare receive sham orthotics . Specific Aim 2 : To evaluate baseline characteristic Veterans CLBP predictive responsiveness custom foot orthotics include age , BMI , psychosocial characteristic arch classification . Focusing Veterans receive custom foot orthotic , investigator next examine important characteristic may predict Veterans likely benefit wear custom foot orthotics . Assessing potential confounders facilitator effectiveness custom foot orthotic allow investigator best describe potential mechanism responsiveness . The investigator choose previously describe confounders responsiveness treatment CLBP , specifically age , body mass index psychosocial characteristic . This methodology particularly important sham control trial ass effectiveness lack thereof , factor intervention confound variable . The investigator also choose evaluate arch classification base measurement Veterans arch ; allow specific recommendation concern use product . Based previous study effectiveness custom foot orthotics addition previous study evaluate CLBP investigator hypothesize Veterans old , high BMI great fear avoidance belief score show less responsiveness custom foot orthotics compare young Veterans lower BMI low fear avoidance belief score . In addition base previous biomechanical literature , investigator feel Veterans low arch show great responsiveness custom foot orthotic .</detailed_description>
