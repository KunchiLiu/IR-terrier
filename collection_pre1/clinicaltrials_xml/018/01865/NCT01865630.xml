	<brief_summary>Subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) special type stroke typically result rupture intracranial aneurysm , weaken wall blood vessel . This type life-threatening bleeding occur 3000 Canadians per year , usually work age adult . Although type stroke account 5-10 % stroke , contributes disproportionately large percent overall stroke morbidity mortality due part young age affect . If one fortunate enough survive initial bleed episode subsequent surgical treatment aneurysm , patient may still develop secondary stroke 3 14 day initial bleed . These delayed stroke significant cause morbidity mortality SAH may potentially preventable . Currently , one medication ( anti-hypertensive ) convincingly show improve outcome SAH . The molecular pathway cause delay stroke still clear , active area research . Animal study reveal delayed stroke may cause pro-inflammation molecule call tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFa ) . Delayed stroke prevent experimentally TNFa blocker call etanercept . This clinical study , utilize prophylactic treatment etanercept patient SAH , ensure safety drug determine effectiveness prevent delay stroke .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>SAH rupture cerebral aneurysm incidence 10 per 100,000 Canadians ( 3000 people annually ) . If person survive SAH rupture intracranial aneurysm , common complication delay cerebral ischemia ( DCI ) . This delayed neurologic deterioration associate angiographic vasospasm . Vasospasm refer arterial constriction typically begin 3 day SAH , maximal 7 8 day later generally resolve 14 day . About two-thirds patient SAH develop vasospasm , one-third develop DCI one-sixth SAH patient die sustain permanent disability DCI , despite aggressive medical/surgical intervention . Nimodipine , calcium-channel antagonist , currently drug convincingly improve outcome SAH . Randomized multi-centre clinical trial utilize clazosentan , endothelin receptor antagonist , demonstrate change clinical outcome despite significant decrease large vessel vasospasm . These result shift research pathophysiology DCI alternative mechanism large vessel vasospasm . It known presence blood subarachnoid space trigger massive local systemic inflammation , include increase production pro-inflammatory cytokine call tumor necrosis factor alpha ( TNFa ) . We show mouse global , smooth muscle-specific knockout TNFa prevents increase myogenic tone reduces brain injury SAH . Furthermore , systemic intrathecal treatment etanercept may prevent increase myogenic tone observe SAH may reduce brain injury . Administration etanercept patient SAH critical step determine safety potential efficacy TNFa antagonists SAH .</detailed_description>
