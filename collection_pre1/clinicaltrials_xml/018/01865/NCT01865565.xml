	<brief_summary>Gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GISTs ) form sarcoma common sarcoma tumor gastrointestinal tract . The limited clinical experience suggest GIST patient may benefit neo-adjuvant therapy primary GIST . This prospective , multicenter , open , observational study evaluation safety efficacy imatinib compare historical data locally unresectable advanced GIST without metastasis . The study include 28-day screening period , follow receive imatinib mesylate ( 400 mg/day ) least 6-12 month follow 3 year surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objective - To observe safety imatinib compare historical data locally unresectable advanced GIST without metastasis . Secondary Objective - Progression-free survival ( PFS ) resect patient follow - R0 resection rate - objective response rate , tumor shrinkage rate - Correlation mutation status response - Correlation PK response - Surgical morbidity mortality safety follow - Quality life - Overall survival ( OS )</detailed_description>
