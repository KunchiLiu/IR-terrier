	<brief_summary>A randomise control trial compare hysterectomy minimally invasive surgical method ; robotic hysterectomy versus vaginal hysterectomy traditional laparoscopic hysterectomy ; outcome cost analysis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Minimally Invasive Benign Hysterectomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic surgery advantageous compare open surgery term patient morbidity , short hospitalization rapid return daily activity . Robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery facilitate high proportion minimally invasive surgery first foremost within gynecologic oncology.It clear whether true less advanced surgery vaginal approach traditional laparoscopic approach possible . Robot-assisted surgery associate additional cost due investment expensive surgical equipment . The study perform investigate whether perform hysterectomy benign condition robotic surgery advantageous term shorter operate time , less complication , less conversion open surgery , short hospital stay comparison minimally invasive procedure vaginal hysterectomy traditional laparoscopic hysterectomy .</detailed_description>
