	<brief_summary>To provide preliminary evaluation correlation Numeric rating Score ( NRS ) skin conductance response per second rest response painful stimulus . Sensitivity specificity calculate NRS skin conductance response per sec standardize painful stimulus . Furthermore , predictor pain examine .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Skin Conductance Fluctuations Per Sec NRS Monitor Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cardiac surgery patient consent participation trial . They ask pre-existing pain , anxiety needle-insertion anxiety outcome operation , employment status . This information obtain self-reported schema patient presence/absence pain anxiety ( response option : yes/no ) ( 1 ) . The intensity pain anxiety measure NRS also range 0 10 one statement range : 0 pain 10 bad possible pain , 0 anxiety 10 bad possible anxiety . The participant request mark point line best agree pain anxiety experience . The intensity pain score 3 NRS consider equal moderate pain ( 1 ) . Furthermore , patient Cardiac Surgery unit observe undergoing pre-defined standardize painful stimulus part standard care treatment prior surgery . The propose study structure use three event . - Event 1 : stimulus , period placement arterial catheter patient administer diazepam , awake calm . The registration 1 min , 1 min anticipate arterial line placement . - Event 2 : standardize painful stimulus , arterial catheter placement , diazepam premedication . The registration arterial catheter placement . - Event 3 : stimulus ; patient anesthetized intubation . The registration 1 min 1 min anticipate intubation . - There also one skin conductance response per sec registration 1 min NRS score , one day postoperatively , ask patient side effect study . During defined event , subject 's skin conductance response evaluate use PainMonitor , subject ask report pain use 10 point NRS scale awake . Before intubation patient anesthetize , without stimulus , define patient pain . During event , number skin conductance responses/sec analyze defined time period , value use statistical analysis . NRS score obtain event value felt pain event ask .</detailed_description>
