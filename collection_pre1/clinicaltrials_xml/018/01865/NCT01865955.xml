	<brief_summary>Pre-procedural ultrasound Spinal &amp; Epidural anesthesia increasingly perform worldwide . Pre-procedural ultrasound assessment spine show facilitate placement epidural anesthesia pregnant woman , diagnostic lumbar puncture , performance spinal anesthesia non-obstetric patient accurate identification interspace puncture perform . This especially important spinal anesthesia , puncture end spinal cord recommend safety . The purpose study compare performance spinal anesthesia pre-procedural ultrasound assessment spine traditional palpatory technique , term pregnant woman undergo elective cesarean delivery . Furthermore , aim describe sonoanatomic feature spine could predict ease insertion spinal anesthesia patient population . We hypothesize term pregnant woman undergo elective cesarean delivery , pre-procedural ultrasound assessment spine improve success rate spinal anesthesia first attempt , compare traditional palpatory technique .</brief_summary>
