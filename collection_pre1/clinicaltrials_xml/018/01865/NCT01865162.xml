Participants measure urine ketone body Ketostix 2x day blood glucose ketone level use self-administered Precision Xtra® Meter ( Abbot Diabetes Care , Alameda , CA , USA ) start first day diet . Self-administered blood check glucose ketone body do fasted state morning 2 hour post-prandially even . Participants see day 7 treatment study nutritionist study investigator-physician ( separately ) review possible AEs , education diet .

	<brief_title>Ketogenic Diet Adjunctive Treatment Refractory/End-stage Glioblastoma Multiforme : Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malignant glioma common type brain tumor adult . They second lead cause cancer mortality people age 35 fourth lead cause age 54 . Standard therapy glioblastoma multiforme ( GBM ) include surgery follow radiation chemotherapy . Despite optimal treatment prognosis remain poor . Patients GBM median survival approximately 10-15 month . Essentially patient suffer recurrent disease , usually within 8 month diagnosis . For patient malignant glioma whose tumor recur , median time tumor progression 9-13 week current standard treatment recurrent glioblastoma , bevacizumab ( AVASTIN® ) . There urgent need effective therapy . GBM cancer cell depend glucose energy supply survival . When glucose level reduce , normal brain cell metabolize ketone body energy . Brain tumor cell . This make tumor cell vulnerable death use therapy target glucose metabolism . In brain cancer patient , high blood glucose level associate reduce survival . In mouse , reduction circulate glucose level ketogenic diet ( KD ) reduce tumor growth Ketogenic diet ( KD ) reduce blood glucose level elevate level ketone body , may thus beneficial treatment GBM non-toxic metabolic therapy . KD high fat , low carbohydrate diet use treatment refractory seizure . There two case report KD use patient GBM show slow tumor progression . Ketogenic diet ( KD ) high fat , low protein , low carbohydrate diet effective treatment refractory epilepsy child . The diet consist long chain saturate triglyceride 3:1 4:1 [ fat ] : [ protein + carbohydrate ] ratio weight , 87-90 % calorie derive fat . The investigator recently evaluate KD caloric restriction 1600 kcal /day adult refractory epilepsy . The diet well tolerate . Side effect include mild nausea ( n=2 ) , mild diarrhea ( n= 2 ) , mild constipation ( n=2 ) . No subject stop treatment side effect . Mild transient hunger experience 3 subject clinically significant hunger . The goal present study evaluate efficacy , safety tolerability 4:1 KD small number patient GBM progress recur standard treatment surgery , radiation chemotherapy temozolamide , rescue threrapy bevacizumab ( AVASTIN® ) , first step evaluation therapeutic potential KD treatment GBM . This small , open label pilot study . 6 patient GBM recur progress surgery , radiation chemotherapy ( temazolamide ) rescue treatment bevacizumab treat 4:1 [ fat ] : [ protein+carbohydrate ] ratio , 1600 kcal/day diet . Survival , time steroid rescue treatment progression free survival compare historical control life expectancy ≤ 3 month . The diet ( KD ) consist pre-made meal , include breakfast , lunch , dinner two snack , one breakfast lunch lunch dinner , 2 week-long meal plan consist different recipe day month , repeat 2-week-long cycle . The diet supplemented vitamin , calcium phosphorus supplement meet requirement US Dietary Reference Intakes ( DRI ) standard . Treatment last 6 month . Primary aim study ( 1 ) obtain pilot data efficacy ketogenic diet adjunctive treatment treatment-refractory glioblastoma multiforme , ( 2 ) evaluate safety ketogenic diet adjunctive treatment treatment-refractory glioblastoma multiforme , ( 3 ) evaluate tolerability ketogenic diet adjunctive treatment treatment-refractory glioblastoma multiforme . Participants evaluate face-to face visit week 1 , 2 4 study , monthly . Primary outcome measure include ( ) survival time ( b ) time dexamethasone rescue therapy cerebral edema , determine treat physician , ( c ) adverse event . Secondary outcome measure include MRI progression , treatment compliance , hunger scale score , fast serum glucose BOH level .</detailed_description>
