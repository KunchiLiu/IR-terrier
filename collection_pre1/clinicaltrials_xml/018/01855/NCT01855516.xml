	<brief_summary>This study design ass : incidence abnormal partial thromboplastin time patient receive unfractionated heparin ( UFH ) 5000 U 2 time day versus 3 time day 72 hour administration first dose heparin . Hypothesis : The basic hypothesis study patient receive UFH 5000 U subcutaneously 3 time day high proportion elevate partial thromboplastin time patient receive UFH 5000 U subcutaneously twice day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Partial Thromboplastin Time After 72 Hours Antithrombotic Prophylaxis Using Unfractionated Heparin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Administration subcutaneous UFH antithrombotic prophylaxis standard therapy postoperative setting . Often , dosage 5000 U twice day use , demonstrate antithrombotic efficacy acceptable hemorrhagic complication profile . However , recent surgery guideline regard antithrombotic prophylaxis UFH 5000 U suggest thrice daily regimen use follow major oncologic surgery . These new guideline raise concern anesthesiology , particularly regard safety epidural catheter combine thrice daily heparin . Optimal analgesia early postoperative period follow type major oncologic surgery involve placement epidural catheter . Epidural analgesia provide best relief significant pain may present thoracotomy supraumbilical laparotomy early postoperative period , improve ambulation , cough , pulmonary function , bowel function well short long-term quality life . However , benefit epidural catheter must outweigh risk complication , fear spinal hematoma . Recent guideline anesthesiology support placement epidural catheter concomitant administration UFH 5000 U two time day . However , guideline clearly support placement epidural catheter three time day regimen use , little data available ass risk practice . Older study ( 1973 ) suggest significant proportion patient ( 15 % ) develop abnormal partial thromboplastin time use three time day regimen . However , know result still consistent recent laboratory technology , compare twice daily heparin . In absence even basic data regard systemic effect coagulation , difficult time begin determine safe practice regard placement epidural catheter presence three time day UFH 5000 U regimen . A recent pilot study conduct center show 20 % ( 4/20 ) patient receive thrice daily regimen develop abnormal partial thromboplastin time 72 hour follow first dose compare 5 % ( 1/20 ) patient receive twice day regimen . This large scale study design establish incidence abnormality partial thromboplastin time 72 hour follow administration first dose heparin regimen . Methods : 130 patient enrol divide two equal group ( Group 1 : receive UFH 5000 U subcutaneous two time day Group 2 : receive UFH 5000 U subcutaneous three time day ) As need standard anesthesia , surgical post-operative care , arterial line place . Immediately prior first UFH dose , blood sample partial thromboplastin time collect arterial line . Since nutritional status may affect patient 's coagulation blood sample measure albumin transthyretin collect simultaneously . The first dose UFH give operate room anesthesiologist . A second blood sample collect venipuncture 72 hour follow administration first dose heparin .</detailed_description>
