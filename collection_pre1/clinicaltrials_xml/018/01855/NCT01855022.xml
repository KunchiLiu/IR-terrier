	<brief_title>A Trial Reduce Readmissions Using Motivational Interviewing Interactive Voice Response</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recruitment Enrollment Participants : Consented participant meet criterion either CHF COPD , identify via daily hospital census report use code International Classification Diseases , 9th Revision randomize either treatment control group . Participants mental physical impairment would prevent use interactive voice response ( IVR ) system communicate health coach exclude . A study health coach visit participant hospital room , explain study protocol , ask would like participate consent study appropriate . After participant sign write consent , health coach provide participant 13-question set PAM record data . Lastly , health coach assign study participant either treatment control group use pre-determined randomization system . Description Intervention : Control Group Activities : Study staff interact control group participant beyond consent collection PAM data , health coach interact baseline . Usual care occur form typical discharge plan hospital staff , consist provide brief traditional patient education participant discharge . Treatment Group Activities : The intervention treatment group consist three component - Interactive Voice response ( IVR ) , MI-based health coaching , notification PCP . First , participant use interactive , voice telephony web-based database system monitor improve self-care behavior clinical status 30 day post discharge . Program participant give call-in number follow first interaction system still hospital , thereby ensure proficiency IVR functionality discharge . Daily thereafter , participant instruct call Tel-Assurance system use cell phone , land-line , via internet . Participants enter Tel-Assurance system use touch-tone phone web browser answer set daily survey question customize assess worsening symptom chronic disease . Information IVR system automatically downloaded secure Internet site review health coach . The data check frequently display way participant ' `` variance '' display top screen , flag coach 's attention . Participants trigger alert symptom out-of-range biometric value ( increase body weight congestive heart failure [ CHF ] , low force expiratory volume chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ COPD ] ) , receive `` same-day '' follow-up call program health coach ( also register nurse ) . If participant miss daily call , receive automated reminder call IVR service encourage adherence . The health coach also monitor adherence system would call participant s/he miss one day . Participants study instruct IVR system use urgent/emergent matter . They also encourage call health coach discus symptom condition . Second , participant receive motivational interviewing ( MI ) -based health coaching , commence still hospital prior discharge 90-days post-discharge . Motivational interview collaborative goal-oriented style communication particular attention language change . It design strengthen personal motivation commitment specific goal elicit explore person 's reason change within atmosphere acceptance compassion . MI evidence-based patient-centered approach four main principle : partnership , acceptance , compassion evocation . There health coaching framework provide structure provider assist time-efficient coaching session : engaging , focus , evoke , plan . In review literature health coaching approach , MI find health coaching technique fully describe consistently demonstrate causally independently associate positive behavioral outcome . Health coach receive rigorous training MI approach regular monitoring . Another optimal feature MI validate standardized tool develop assess fidelity provider/patient session approach . The Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity ( MITI ) tool use train active phase study ensure coach achieved/maintained level proficiency link clinical outcome . Starting health coach process participant still hospital attempt ease transition home help participant understand treatment plan empower him/her communicate case shift health status could result readmission . Continued health coaching session participant throughout 90-day study period provide address participant 's activation level , thus , ability self-manage his/her condition well . This approach individually tailor participant base initial PAM score . In addition , health coach discuss typical challenge participant may face recuperate hospital stay , understand follow treatment plan . Lastly , participant empower take active role manage condition health , include appropriate timely interaction PCP problem arose could lead deterioration health status . If participant readmitted hospital study period , health coach provide follow participant PCP determine best course action . In addition , study staff determine cause readmission record analysis , perform discuss study staff on-going basis throughout study period . Third , investigator attempt engage participant 's primary care provider ( PCP ) care plan directly provide discharge summary upon participant 's release hospital . Informing PCP participant 's hospitalization increase likelihood PCP 's office would proactive reach participant schedule follow-up office visit . The provider encourage : ( ) schedule office visit participant ; ( b ) communicate directly health coach suggest area focus care plan . The investigator successful get PCP 's contact health coach discuss patient 's progress health plan . Outcome Measures : All outcome analyze separately two condition , congestive heart failure ( CHF ) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) . The investigator ' primary outcome study readmission , hospital day , emergency department visit occur within 90 day discharge index admission . The investigator ' secondary outcome 90 day mortality patient activation measure score 30 90 day . The investigator review statistic relate IVR technology use track treatment patient ' disease specific symptom . All analysis conduct use intention treat approach .</detailed_description>
