	<brief_summary>Ectopic pregnancy important cause maternal morbidity occasionally mortality . Deaths associate ectopic pregnancy decline , though approximately 75 % death first trimester 9-13 % pregnancy-related death associate ectopic pregnancy . The main stays management ectopic pregnancy surgery medical treatment . Medical management systemic methotrexate administration avoids inherent morbidity anesthesia surgery cost-effective , also offer success rate comparable surgical management , loss future potential fertility . However , although medical management use methotrexate use commonly , solid consensus regard dose protocol . Currently , three methotrexate protocol treatment ectopic pregnancy , `` multi-dose '' , `` single-dose '' , `` two-dose '' . Among , multi-dose protocol include administration 4 methotrexate dos alternate leucovorin ( rescue regimen ) . As result multiple dose methotrexate , side effect common . In contrast , advantage single-dose protocol include elimination rescue regimen , low incidence adverse effect , good compliance . However , single-dose protocol find associate considerably low success rate compare multi-dose protocol ( 88 % versus 93 % ) recent meta-analysis . The two-dose protocol , balance efficacy safety/convenience , describe cross multi-dose single-dose protocol . However , study compare single-dose two-dose protocol . The purpose prospective randomize trial compare success rate single-dose two-dose methotrexate protocol treatment tubal ectopic pregnancy .</brief_summary>
