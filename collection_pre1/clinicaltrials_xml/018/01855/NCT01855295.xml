	<brief_summary>Poor nutritional status evidence low body mass index , low muscle mass low serum albumin strong predictor morbidity mortality dialysis patient . Hypercatabolism induced inflammation widely consider cause uremic malnutrition even though clear evidence hemodialysis patient elevate C-reactive protein ( CRP ) level great risk lose weight muscle mass . Conversely , little data whether dialysis patient malnutrition elevate C-reactive protein level would gain muscle mass protein supplementation . The hypothesis protein supplementation dialysis improve muscle mass , functional status quality life inflame malnourished hemodialysis patient . Therefore , objective current proposal examine malnourish ( body mass index &lt; 23 kg/m2 serum creatinine &lt; 8 mg/dL ) hemodialysis patient inflammation ( high sensitivity CRP &gt; 3 mg/dL ) , effect protein supplementation 1 . Muscle mass determine creatinine kinetics 2 . Functional status assess 6 min walk 3 . Quality life assess Short Form -12 survey</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Design : Open label trial . Recruitment Randomization : Men woman age 18 old receiving care University Utah dialysis center . Study procedure : Men woman hemodialysis least 3 month malnutrition ( define Body Mass Index less 23 kg/m2 serum creatinine &lt; 8 mg/dL ) approach determine whether want participate study . If interested , study purpose procedure explain informed consent obtain . 5 ml screen blood obtain dialysis measure CRP . If great &gt; 3 mg/dL , individual eligible participate study . Participants ask complete brief questionnaire demographic ( age , gender , race , education ) , comorbid condition , physical activity level quality life . Height , weight , waist circumference measure . Relevant data dialysis , medication , laboratory marker obtain electronic medical record . The investigator anticipate obtain screening blood draw 80 participant half elevate CRP qualify participate study . The 40 participant receive dietary advice increase protein intake 1.2 g/kg/day monitor 12 week . Then , participant receive 45 gram liquid protein supplement dialysis treatment additional 12 week total study duration 24 week . Compliance tolerance supplement monitor . Protein supplementation Boost , Procel liquid supplement use regularly dialysis patient . The protein supplement use study Provide Sugar Free produce Provide Nutrition LC . The Food Drug Administration regulate nutrition supplement . It liquid supplement make enzyme hydrolyzed collagen protein . This supplement use malnutrition , bariatric surgery , dialysis , poor appetite , wound care . The investigator choose supplement investigator able get reduce cost . There data available show supplement well bad supplement currently available . The manufacturer state sugar free Provide phosphorous free . However , investigator monitor phosphorous level study patient . Pre-dialysis blood sample ( 15 ml lithium heparin tube ) post dialysis blood sample ( 5 ml lithium heparin tube ) drawn baseline , 4 , 12 , 16 20 week . Pre post dialysis creatinine along 44-hour urine collection creatinine obtain baseline 4 , 12 , 16 24 week estimate muscle mass use creatinine kinetics . Short Form -12 survey quality life obtain baseline 4 , 12 , 16 , 24 week . Distances walk 6-minutes record baseline , 4 , 12 , 16 24 week . Assays Serum analytes : 1 . Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) : The measurement serum IL-6 perform use IMMULITE 1000 analyzer reagent Diagnostic Products Corporation . The performance characteristic immunoassay include analytic measurement range 2 1000 pg/mL , imprecision &lt; 7.6 % 88 1000 pg/mL , reference interval &lt; 6 pg/mL . 2 . Tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNF-alpha ) : The measurement serum TNF- alpha perform use IMMULITE 1000 analyzer reagent Diagnostic Products Corporation . The performance characteristic immunoassay include analytic measurement range 2 1000 pg/mL , imprecision &lt; 6.6 % 17 788 pg/mL , reference interval &lt; 8 pg/mL . 3. high sensitivity CRP : The measurement serum C-reactive protein perform use FDA-cleared Roche Tina-quant latex high sensitivity kit Roche MODULAR P analyzer . The performance characteristic turbidimetric assay include analytic measurement range 0.1 20 mg/L imprecision &lt; 5.8 % . 4 . Insulin : The measure insulin perform use Diagnostic Products Corporation kit IMMULITE 2000 analyzer . The performance characteristic immunoassay include analytic measurement range 2 300 mIU/L , imprecision &lt; 7.4 % 8 291 mIU/L , fast reference interval &lt; 29 mIU/L .</detailed_description>
