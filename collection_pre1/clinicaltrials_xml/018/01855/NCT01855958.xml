	<brief_summary>The aim study evaluate cortical excitability pain knee osteoarthritis ( OA ) , well effect one session kind electroacupuncture ( deep needling intramuscular stimulation therapy - DIMST ) pain cortical excitability intervention . The hypothesis cortical excitability alter condition , confirm finding already describe chronic pain condition . The investigator also believe session DIMST reduce pain alter cortical excitability , restore previous activity occur chronic pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Motor Cortex Plasticity Effect Deep Intramuscular Needling Stimulation Therapy ( DIMST ) Osteoarthritis Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent development treatment chronic pain show primary motor cortex ( M1 ) effective target neural brain stimulation technique , transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) . Due promise initial result , plasticity M1 also investigate potential marker chronic pain . TMS study use single pair pulse show change M1 plasticity neuropathic pain fibromyalgia pain compare healthy subject . Thus , decrease inhibitory activity chronic pain take state show uninhibited measuring TMS indexed intracortical inhibition ( ICI ) cortical silent period ( CSP ) . Based experimental data clinical study focus effect neuromodulation technique M1 excitability . The technique use stimulate peripheral nervous system investigate use different approach . The DIMST therapy apply treat peripheral chronic syndrome may central component myofascial pain . During DIMST , needle apply spinal segment associate nerve root dermatome correspond pathology . This treatment also effective treatment disease major peripheral component OA . OA major cause suffer disability elderly , inflammatory component , factor contributes symptoms progression disease . There evidence OA could lead sensitization central segmental , effect M1 plasticity central component completely know . Therefore , researcher propose evaluate plasticity M1 chronic pain condition also effect bottom-up DIMST pain cortical excitability .</detailed_description>
