	<brief_summary>There increase incidence Necrotizing Enterocolitis ( NEC ) affect premature infant population , principally associate risk like extreme prematurity , extreme low birth weight , associate co-morbidities ( Congenital heart disease , perinatal asphyxia ) born hospital limit resource optimal neonatal care . Near Infrared Spectroscopy ( NIRS ) , use premature infant evaluate change cerebral perfusion oxygenation . ( 1 ) It provide real time insight oxygen delivery . ( 3 ) In premature patient population , many neurologic injury occur result prenatal ( pre-existing ) and/or postnatal disturbance oxygen delivery . NIRS focus cerebral monitoring . Light easily penetrate neonatal bone skin tissue , allow monitor subjacent oxygen content . Early study perform validate NIRS measurement establish normative data . ( 4-6 ) The non-invasive method monitor cerebral hemodynamics oxygenation revolutionize intensive care unit patient risk neurological injury . This method successfully validate monitor neonatal cerebral oxygenation different clinical setting study protocol . ( 7 ) NIRS provide non-invasive , continuous information tissue perfusion oxygen dynamic . One big challenge NEC spectrum disease make early diagnosis . It important monitor cerebral perfusion also intestinal oxygenation . ( 8,9 ) Previous study NIRS demonstrate premature infant change cerebral - splanchnic oxygenation ratio feeding . ( 10 ) Guy et al . perform NIRS premature piglet demonstrate association perfusion change NEC spectrum ( 11,12 ) ; study suggest evidence NIRS could useful diagnostic tool premature infant population trough abdominal NIRS ( a-NIRS ) measurement capable detect alteration intestinal oxygenation perfusion . In summary , a-NIRS could use premature infant population define reference value , especially patient risk , would facilitate early diagnosis NEC spectrum disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Abdominal Tissue Oxygenation Premature Infants Using Near Infrared Spectroscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We include , 10 premature infant 32 36 week post menstrual age , within first week life , clinically stable without diagnosis Congenital Heart Disease , Necrotizing Enterocolitis , Sepsis transfuse less three day evaluation . Infants abdominal injury , omphalocele , gastroschisis abdominal skin irritation permit application probe also exclude . 10 premature infant 32 36 week post menstrual age include , first week life , clinically stable status , without diagnosis Congenital Heart Disease , Necrotizing Enterocolitis , Sepsis blood transfuse less three day moment evaluation . Infants abdominal injury , Omphalocele , Gastroschisis , skin irritation also exclude . NIRS device record monitor Regional Oxygen Saturation ( rSO2 ) infant one week . The evaluation take place ar Neonatal Intensive Care Unit ( NICU ) , 6th floor Mary Horrigan Connors Center Women 's Health , Brigham Women 's Hospital . ( http : //www.brighamandwomens.org/newbornmedicine ) We use Near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) device INVOS 5100c ( Covidien ) , catalogue de Investigational Device Exemption ( IDE ) 'non-significant risk device ' ( 21 CFR 812.2 ) order perform monitoring well record-keeping non-risk subject . No need Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) clearance . The application INVOS 5100c ( Covidien ) sensor optodes position four location ( four channel ) , low abdomen , take place bellow umbilicus , care , flush skin ; submandibular region ; upper leave abdomen well thigh either leave right . If clinical status change monitoring , could discontinue criterion attend neonatologist charge . Once include , sensor place described area team reassure quality lecture obtain . The rSO2 record continuously monitor seven day , period time , prospective observational follow patient data outcomes implement . Clinical outcome data correlate tissue oxygen saturation , outcome variable include length NICU stay , morbidity , mortality , laboratory study , oxygen saturation standard pulse oximetry continuous outcome variable analyze use Analysis Variance ( ANOVA ) formula ; mortality analyze use Student 's t-test . For remain variable ( vital sign , lab value , oxygen saturation , morbidity , mortality ) , data extract clinical record enter electronic database . The study staff , principal investigator , co-investigators identify potential subject meet inclusion/exclusion criterion . Potential subject identify talk attend charge NICU . Cases identify communicate NIRS/NICU research team Brigham Women 's Hospital . Informed consent obtain parent ( ) guardian ( ) Research involve great minimal risk condition ( 46.404 ) least one parent must provide permission . In case approach attend physician prospective subject describe study obtain verbal consent approach patient recruitment ; attend physician medical staff care patient first make contact patient parent guardian describe study briefly ask permission u explain study detail . A review data conduct physician clinical review team . The principal investigator study staff constantly monitor review right , safety welfare subject trial study . In addition , principal investigator review adverse event report accordance Partners Human Research Committees ( PHRC ) regulation .</detailed_description>
