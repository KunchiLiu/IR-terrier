	<brief_summary>Fragile X syndrome ( FXS ) present alteration synaptic plasticity produce intellectual disability . produce improvement . Estrogens ( target Estrogen Receptors beta ( ER-β ) act neuroprotective agent , promote synaptic plasticity neurite outgrowth , health benefit derive flavonoid , flavonol epigallocatechin gallate ( EGCG ) , phytoestrogens natural origin partially explain interaction membrane ER . Selective ER-β flavonoid thus good candidate therapeutic evaluation intellectual disability . EGCG also target central intracellular transduction signal alter FXS improve memory recognition FXS animal model ( adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) -inhibitor phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) extracellular signal-regulated kinase ( ERK1/2 ) . This study target synaptic plasticity alteration underlie learn memory impairment also computational disability FXS . The hypothesis EGCG act favor physiological process involve cognition .</brief_summary>
