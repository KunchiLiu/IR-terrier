	<detailed_description>How stable total knee replacement depend correct precise rotation femoral component . Abnormal femoral component rotation associate numerous adverse condition include knee instability , knee pain , scar tissue , abnormal knee motion . Controversy exist , however , regard favorable surgical technique determine accurate femoral component rotation . Some doctor prefer measure resection technique landmarks femur bone use determine place femoral component . Others recommend gap-balancing technique femoral component position balance ligament knee place position ligament equally strain . The purpose study examine impact measure resection gap-balancing surgical technique total knee replacement move patient knee outcome score . Knee outcome score assess response give patient question outcomes associated total knee replacement relate pain , symptom , activity daily live , sport recreational function , knee-related quality life .</detailed_description>
