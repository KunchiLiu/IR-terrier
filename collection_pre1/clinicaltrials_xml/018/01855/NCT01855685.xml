	<brief_summary>X-linked chronic granulomatous disease ( X-CGD ) rare genetic disorder , affect boy . It cause error gene make part immune system . The basic defect lie specialise white blood cell call phagocytic cell ( phagocyte ) , responsible protection infection destroy invade bacteria fungi . They pour large amount substance similar bleach onto organism . In CGD , defect system make bleach , call NADPH-oxidase . In X-CGD ( account two third patient ) , defect lie gene make critical part NADPH-oxidase ( know gp91-phox ) , cell make bleach-like substance . Therefore kill bacteria fungi poorly , patient suffer severe recurrent infection . This also result inflammation damage part body lung gut . In many case , patient adequately protected infection constant intake antibiotic . However , others , severe life-threatening infection break . In case , inflammation bowel urinary system result blockage treat antibiotic , may require use drug steroid . Development curative treatment CGD therefore great importance .</brief_summary>
