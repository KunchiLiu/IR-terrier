	<brief_title>PENELOPE Observational Study : Prophylaxis Treatment Arterial Venous Thromboembolism</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Illness treatment overview The incidence venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) among patient haematological malignancy recently review ( 1 ) . For patient lymphoma , incidence VTE range 1.5 14.6 % 59 % patient central nervous system lymphoma . The incidence VTE patient acute leukaemia varies time , 1.4 9.6 % diagnosis 1.7 12 % induction therapy . Notably , high rate VTE report patient acute promyelocytic leukaemia , value 6 16 % large series . In patient multiple myeloma receive antithrombotic prophylaxis , rate VTE increase 26 % undergoing treatment regimen include immumodulatory drug ( thalidomide lenalidomide ) ( 1 ) . Moreover , patient undergo autologous allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) , rate VTE 2.9 9.9 % , central venous catheter ( CVC ) -associated majority case ( 2-4 ) . VTE show occur even period severe thrombocytopenia ; one-third event patient series occur platelet count &lt; 50 x109/L ( 3 ) . Patients acute leukaemia high risk haemorrhage , mostly relate thrombocytopenia result haematological disease and/or chemotherapy , administration anticoagulant drug set problematic . No randomised control trial address issue VTE treatment patient acute leukaemia , management case base small group patient series expert ' opinion . Five report describe detail case paediatric adult patient malignancy thrombocytopenia treat heparin result VTE ( 5-9 ) . Out total 54 case , 32 haematological malignancy platelet nadir &lt; 50 x109/L ( review ref . 10 ) . The majority patient ( 22 32 ) CVC-related thrombosis . A full dose low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) bid administer majority patient CVC-related thrombosis totality patient thrombosis CVC-related . All patient receive platelet transfusion platelet count fell &lt; 20-40 x109/L , dose LMWH halve platelet count &lt; 20 x109/L one report . None patient major bleed . Rethrombosis occur three 32 ( 9.3 % ) patient ( 6,7 ) . In large series 379 patient acute leukaemia , treatment 20 patient one ( n=16 ) two ( n= 4 ) VTE event essentially base administration enoxaparin 100 U/kg bid ; case platelet count &lt; 50 x109/L clinical suspicion bleed risk dose reduce 100 U/kg qd 50 U/kg bid . Alternatively , patient receive continuous i.v . infusion unfractionated heparin ( UFH ) obtain aPTTs low therapeutic range ( 1.5 time great basal value ) . Secondary prophylaxis acute VTE base administration enoxaparin 100 U/kg qd case ongoing chemotherapy vitamin K-antagonists ( VKA ) ( INR 2 3 ) otherwise . In general , length secondary prophylaxis report longer six month ( 11 ) . The safety therapeutic anticoagulation treatment management thrombocytopenic patient also evaluate two series patient receive HSCT ( 12,13 ) . In 10 patient multiple myeloma receive autologous HSCT , anticoagulation require follow pre-transplant CVC-related subclavian vein thrombosis ( n= 8 ) , pulmonary embolism two month prior transplant ( n= 1 ) , history acute intermittent atrial fibrillation complicate arterial embolus leg ( n= 1 ) . Beginning first day high-dose chemotherapy , 10 patient receive therapeutic UFH ( 5,000 U i.v . bolus follow 1,000 U per h ) maintain aPTTs 50 70 second switch VKA treatment condition stabilise . UFH treatment interrupt VKA administration produce therapeutic INR &gt; 2 two consecutive day . Heparinised patient receive platelet transfusion maintain count &gt; 30 x109/L . Three patient develop bleed ( haematuria , haematemesis , mucosal bleed ) require transfusion , thrombotic event occur ( 12 ) . In another series 26 patient HSCT give enoxaparin treatment VTE , 21 patient haematological malignancy . There 25 VTE event record ( four patient two event different site ) 11 case upper extremity CVC-related deep venous thrombosis . During period thrombocytopenia ( &lt; 55 x109/L ) , enoxaparin administration reduce median value 49 U/kg/day ( range 34-75 ) withdrawn instance platelet count fell 20 x109/L . Two major bleed event ( 8 % ) occur , one case fatal ( 13 ) . The aforementioned data insufficient production evidence-based guideline . Experts AIEOP ( Associazione Italiana di Ematologia e Oncologia Pediatrica ) suggest first two week treatment consist administration full-dose LMWH ( anti-factor Xa level 0.5-1 U/ml ) , maintain platelet count 50 x109/L . After first two week , halve dose recommend platelet count 20 50 x109/L . If platelet count 20 x109/L , advise LMWH therapy discontinue platelet count recovers great 20 x109/L ( 14-16 ) . Recent guideline SISET ( Societ√† Italiana per lo Studio dell'Emostasi e della Trombosi ) also suggest patient haematological malignancy VTE LMWH prefer VKA either first six month long time ( 17 ) . Arterial thrombosis rarely report patient acute leukemia herald manifestation complicate course disease ( 18-21 ) . However , detail concern antithrombotic treatment platelet count time event lack majority report case . There publish study concern use novel antithrombotic agent fondaparinux , direct thrombin factor Xa inhibitor , patient haematological malignancy thrombocytopaenia . However , vitro experiment perform plasma child ALL antithrombin deficiency result administration asparaginase demonstrate direct thrombin inhibitor melagatran generate consistent anticoagulant response independent antithrombin level . Therefore , drug class may important potential use field ( 22 ) . Rationale Data treatment arterial venous thromboembolism patient haematological malignancy thrombocytopenia mainly anecdotal . The limited knowledge set allow plan randomize controlled trial , lack standard care quite uncertain benefit risk different strategy . Therefore plan observational study either retrospective prospective gain information efficacy safety different therapeutic strategy patient hematologic neoplasms platelet count &lt; 50 x109/L diagnosis arterial venous thromboembolism .</detailed_description>
