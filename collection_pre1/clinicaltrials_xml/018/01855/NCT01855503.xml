	<brief_summary>This molecular testing study patient metastatic breast cancer . The purpose study find defect DNA cancer could potentially treat US Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve investigational drug . For example , cancer mutation Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) gene ( mutation change int DNA sequence gene ) make receptor `` superactive '' drug inhibits receptor may also inhibit growth cancer . If genetic defect present cancer drug may work . This EGFR gene mutation base patient selection treatment work lung cancer test value breast cancer . What drug may available particular genetic abnormality context clinical study change time .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . All patient metastatic breast cancer consider systemic therapy eligible regardless number prior therapy . 2 . Patient must metastatic lesion could safely biopsied without imageguidance . The final arbiter decide lesion biopsied physician perform biopsy . 3 . There age limit study . However , study include child metastatic breast cancer occur child . 4 . Patients may participate biopsy study multiple time repeat molecular assessment cancer progression . 5 . Patients undergo routine clinical biopsy metastatic breast cancer also eligible participate study . When routine biopsy obtain diagnostic purpose , additional biopsy take biopsy session molecular analysis . 1 . Known medical contraindication needle biopsy procedure bleed disorder , low platelet count , inability provide inform consent</criteria>
