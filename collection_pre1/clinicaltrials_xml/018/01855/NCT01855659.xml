	<brief_summary>Peak Inspiratory Flow Rate ( PIFR ) define fast flow rate note inspiratory cycle . Inhaled medication play important role treatment chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) , dry powder inhaler ( DPIs ) increasingly replace meter dose inhaler ( MDIs ) . DPIs interest require need coordinate actuation MDI device inhalation use large spacer device 1-3 . Several DPIs available administration inhale corticosteroid , well bronchodilator , correspond different type inhaler ( e.g . Diskus® , Turbuhaler® , Aeroliser® , etc. ) . During inspiratory effort patient generate pressure drop consequent airflow across DPI . This inspiratory flow high enough disaggregate adequately disperse drug powder aerosol cloud drug particle guarantee optimal deposition medication lung . Such peak inspiratory flow ( PIFs ) dependent patient 's inhalation effort also internal resistance device . It show optimal deposition medication DPIs achieve patient low inspiratory flow rate , child patient COPD , especially acute exacerbation . In condition use DPI low internal resistance suggest , ensure optimal deposition despite low flow rate . In addition , many clinician nowadays confront important number COPD patient age &gt; 70 yr</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Single-center Study Assess Peak Inspiratory Flow ( PIF ) Different Stages ' COPD Patients Using In-check Method .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study assess inspiratory flow rate high level resistance different stage COPD patient . PIF measure in-check method . Commonly use Asthma patient , In-Check Oral Inspiratory Flow Meter portable hand-held inspiratory flow meter provide assessment speed inhalation . The In-Check Oral measure inspiratory flow 30 370 L/min , inspiratory flow think physician sensitive marker Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) screening . The In-Check Oral work patient inhales mouth , cause air draw meter cursor move along scale indicate speed inhalation . The flow rate achieve note check position cursor calibrate scale . The Standard In-Check Oral inspiratory flow meter measure inspiratory flow rate range 30 370 l/min , accuracy +/- 10 % 10 l/min ( whichever great ) . ( A Low Range In-Check Oral Inspiratory flow meter available special request , measure 15 120 l/min ) . All In-Check Oral meter calibrate use ATS pulmonary waveform generator , product complies Australian New Zealand standard back pressure flow meter . As inhalation device check loose foreign object important . The transparent body In-Check Oral meter design allow visual inspection use . The meter manufacture medical grade component , suitable multiple patient us clean appropriately patient . The expected life In-Check Oral , normal use , two year . Commonly use Asthma patient , In-Check Oral Inspiratory Flow Meter portable hand-held inspiratory flow meter provide assessment speed inhalation .

As inhalation device check loose foreign object important . The transparent body In-Check Oral meter design allow visual inspection use . The meter manufacture medical grade component , suitable multiple patient use clean appropriately patient . The expected life In-Check Oral , normal use , two Accurately measure oral inspiratory flow rate ( peak sub-maximal ) order assess suitability inhale medication - Measures nasal inspiratory flow assess nasal airway patency - Assesses response nasal provocation - Allows home monitoring Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow ( PNIF ) - Easy use , clean reset , In-Check help patient maintain respiratory health . - High-quality medical-grade stainless steel plastic construction - Sterilizable plastic mouthpiece accept different mask size - Simple enough home patient use , rugged enough routine clinic use .</detailed_description>
