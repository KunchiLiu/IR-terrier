	<brief_title>Second-line Treatment With Icotinib Esophageal Carcinoma Patients With EGFR Overexpression ( IHC 3+ ) Positive FISH</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) signal critical cancer cell proliferation , invasion , metastasis , resistance apoptosis.EGFR overexpressed many epithelial malignancy therefore make attractive therapeutic target.This study design evaluate efficacy safety icotinib treat advanced carcinoma gastroesophageal junction esophagus EGFR overexpression ( IHC 3+ ) positive FISH , primary endpoint objective response rate . Secondary endpoint include progress-free survival , overall survival , safety .</detailed_description>
