	<brief_summary>A major challenge researcher cancer care expedite development new therapeutic Center Personalized Cancer Treatment ( collaboration Dept . Medical Oncology University Medical Center Utrecht , Netherlands Cancer Center - Antoni van Leeuwenhoek hospital Erasmus Medical Center - DaniÃ«l den Hoed clinic ) initiative achieve goal . The current future generation anti-cancer drug develop specifically activate deactivate deregulate gene product signal pathway cancer cell . The development `` target '' agent excite new opportunity promise deliver anti-cancer efficacy less toxicity . Although targeted therapy breakthrough medical oncology lead development portfolio potentially successful new drug , yet deliver much need relief large patient population . We believe development agent mainly hamper lack successful patient selection . The CPCT aim select patient clinical trial participation base result Next Generation Sequencing ( NGS ) information obtain tumor material . The advent NGS platform enable u probe significant proportion cancer genome thus develop realistic view complex genetic change cancer cell . The CPCT aim use NGS platform improve selection patient target therapy trial . We obtain tumor biopsy ( preferably ) metastatic locally advanced lesion peripheral blood sample patient include trial ; biopsy obtain information tumor relate genetic mutation ( mutational profile ) blood sample assess patient 's germline DNA background variation . As patient ask undergo invasive procedure important address potential safety issue . Review literature show general tumor biopsy perform minor complication acceptable risk . We recruit patient metastatic locally advanced ( incurable ) solid tumor aim use information obtain DNA sequence stratify patient inclusion clinical trial . The final personalized treatment decision make dependent availability trial expect predictive value mutational profile .</brief_summary>
