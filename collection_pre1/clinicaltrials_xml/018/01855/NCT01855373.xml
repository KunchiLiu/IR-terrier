	<brief_title>Comparing Blood Sugar Levels Endothelial Function PEAK ATP® With GlycoCarn® , PEAK ATP® GlycoCarn® Supplements</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , parallel design evaluate effectiveness , safety tolerability study substance utilized support improve healthy level blood sugar endothelial function . Each subject randomize receive specific dose PEAK ATP® ( Adenosine 5'-Triphosphate Disodium Salt ) GlycoCarn® ( Glycine Propionyl-L-Carnitine Hydrochloride , USP ( United States Pharmacopeia ) , PEAK ATP® ( Adenosine 5'-Triphosphate Disodium Salt ) GlycoCarn® ( Glycine Propionyl-L-Carnitine Hydrochloride , USP ) Placebo twice daily . Participants undergo assessment blood test , brachial ultrasound determine change flow mediate dilation , body weight , % body fat , BMI , waist/hip circumference blood pressure . The primary objective study evaluate safety , tolerability effectiveness PEAK ATP® GlycoCarn® , PEAK ATP® GlycoCarn® improve level blood sugar via assessment plasma glucose . Secondary objective : 1 . To assess flow-mediated dilation determine brachial ultrasound evaluation . 2 . To assess effect change blood level HbA1C , high-sensitivity C-Reactive Protein ( hs-CRP ) , Insulin , Nitric Oxide ( NOx ) , Malondialdehyde ( MAL ) , Soluble Inter-cellular Adhesion Molecule-1 ( sICAM-1 ) E-Selectin . 3 . To assess effect body weight , Body Mass Index ( BMI ) , % body fat measure skin caliper , waist hip circumference , blood pressure . 4 . To assess effect general sexual health male female determine questionnaire .</detailed_description>
