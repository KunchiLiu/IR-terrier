	<brief_summary>This study treat participant newly diagnose , low , intermediate high risk rhabdomyosarcoma ( RMS ) use multi-modality risk-adapted therapy standard intensify dose chemotherapy , radiation surgical resection . Intermediate high risk participant receive additional 12 week ( 4 cycle ) maintenance therapy anti-angiogenic chemotherapy . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : - Estimate event-free survival intermediate risk participant treat vincristine , dactinomycin cyclophosphamide addition maintenance anti-angiogenic therapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : - Estimate false negative rate incidence additional positive lymph node participant undergo sentinel lymph node biopsy follow limited nodal dissection . - Maintain high local control rate participant treat surgery and/or limited volume proton photon radiation without dose escalation . - Define incidence type failure participant receive risk-adapted local therapy relative primary tumor volume . - Establish feasibility deliver 4 cycle maintenance anti-angiogenic chemotherapy intermediate high risk patient follow standard chemotherapy . - Estimate event free survival high risk patient receive interval dose compress therapy maintenance anti-angiogenic therapy . - Define incidence CTC grade 3 high toxicity ( specific grade 1-2 toxicity ) relate proton beam therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants stratify base pretreatment stag system post-surgery surgico/pathologic clinical grouping system . Treatment low-risk ( subset 1 ) participant consist chemotherapy radiation . Low-risk ( subset 2 ) intermediate-risk participant receive chemotherapy radiation and/or undergo surgery destroy/remove tumor . Intermediate-risk participant also receive 16 week maintenance chemotherapy . High-risk participant receive chemotherapy radiation therapy . High-risk participant also receive additional maintenance therapy anti-angiogenic chemotherapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Newly diagnose , previously untreated participant localize rhabdomyosarcoma ( RMS ) . Must either low , intermediate , highrisk disease , define : Lowrisk : Embryonal , botryoid , spindle cell tumor ( Subset 1 : Stage 1 , Group I ; Stage 1 Group I ; Stage 1 Group III orbital ; Stage 2 Group I ; Stage 2 Group II ) ( Subset 2 : Stage 1 Group III non orbit ; Stage 3 Group I , II ) Intermediaterisk : Embryonal , botryoid , spindle cell RMS Stage 2 3 Group III ; Alveolar , undifferentiated , anaplastic RMS : Stage 13 , group II ; I ) Highrisk : Embryonal , botryoid , spindle cell , alveolar , undifferentiated , anaplastic RMS metastatic disease diagnosis ( stage 4 ) . Participants treat protocol low intermediate risk arm experience disease progression prior week 13 transfer high risk arm proceed high risk chemotherapy start week 1 protocol . Age &lt; 22 year ( eligible 22nd birthday ) Performance level correspond ECOG score 0 , 1 , 2 . The Lansky performance score use participant &lt; 16 year Participant receive prior radiotherapy chemotherapy rhabdomyosarcoma ( exclude steroid ) . Prior biopsy , surgical resection lymph node sampling allow . Initiation chemotherapy plan within 6 week ( 42 day ) definitive biopsy surgical resection . Adequate bone marrow function define : Peripheral absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 750/μL Platelet count ≥ 75,000/μL ( transfusion independent ) Adequate liver function define total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) age . Participants biliary hepatic primary bilirubin value great 1.5 x ULN may enrol study eligibility criterion meet . Adequate renal function define : Creatinine clearance radioisotope GFR ≥ 70 mL/min/1.732 Serum creatinine base age gender Participants urinary tract obstruction tumor must meet renal function criterion list AND must unimpeded urinary flow establish via decompression obstruct portion urinary tract . Patients require emergency radiation therapy eligible enrollment study . Females childbearing potential pregnant breastfeeding . Female participant ≥ 10 year age postmenarchal must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 24 hour prior begin treatment . Female participant breast feeding must agree stop breast feeding . Sexually active patient childbearing potential must willing use effective contraception therapy least 1 month treatment complete . No evidence active , uncontrolled infection . All participant and/or parent legal guardian must sign write informed consent . Participants fail meet one inclusion criterion exclude .</criteria>
