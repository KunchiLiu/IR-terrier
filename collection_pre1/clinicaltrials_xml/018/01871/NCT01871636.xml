	<brief_title>ESD Versus EMR Treatment Early Barrett ` Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conventional technique endoscopic mucosal resection ( EMR ) snare resection usually achieve resection gastrointestinal mucosal neoplastic lesion large 1 cm diameter single piece ( `` en-bloc '' ) . En-bloc resection even fail case small lesion depend location shape . Extension EMR piecemeal resection therefore frequently require removal target neoplastic area . However histological evaluation several specimen usually identify outer margin neoplastic area . Thus complete R0 resection histologically confirm . Histologically important additional information , e.g . infiltration lymphatic vessel submucosal infiltration may miss resected specimen due coagulation artifact leave tissue bridge . In addition piecemeal EMR early neoplasia Barrett ` esophagus associate high recurrence rate probably minor remnant neoplastic tissue . In contrast EMR technique endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD ) allow en-bloc resection even large neoplastic lesion . Variations method increasingly use various type early gastrointestinal neoplasia mainly Asian country . In Japan ESD approve treatment select case early gastric colorectal neoplasia alternative surgery . A recent meta-analysis non-randomized control trial show ESD early gastrointestinal tumor superior EMR term en-bloc resection curative resection rate time-consuming associate high rate bleed perforation . A small series ESD also report Western country . The waterjet-assisted ESD technology ( WESD ) allow pressure control injection fluid tip recently develop HybridKnife® . Submucosal injection , circumferential cut dissection lesion well coagulation bleeding source perform device without need change instrument . These option accelerate procedure may increase safety efficacy . Experimental trial ex vivo vivo pig model show gastrointestinal mucosa different site effectively safely lifted gentle placement HybridKnife® wall needleless injection saline solution pressure 30 - 70 bar . Our group report effective en-bloc resection esophageal area 14 case Erlangen porcine model . We subsequently compare WESD EMR predefined esophageal mucosal lesion anesthetizised pig randomize controlled trial . The result demonstrate WESD frequently achieve complete resection significantly low number specimen . WESD cause perforation bleeding could endoscopically manage procedure . Furthermore , apply WESD early gastric neoplasia prospective single center study . This study involve 29 consecutive patient . The result confirm experimental finding WESD simplifies ESD procedure effectively safely perform . Repici et al . apply WESD methodology colorectal neoplasia large 3 cm diameter . Also clinical study show WESD safe effective method provide en-bloc curative resection select case colorectal neoplastic lesion . In addition recently report technology first clinical trial WESD early Barrett ` neoplasia . The result indicate WESD safely effectively perform esophagus . It achieve en-bloc resection early BE neoplasia 27 30 patient . The rate histologically complete resection ( R0 ) 38.5 % high previously report focal EMR BE-EAC . We discuss high rate expect case well delineate lesion definition R0 resection histologically complete resection adenocarcinoma HGIN . This definition would consider LGIN lateral margin incomplete resection accordance recent trial ESD early colorectal neoplasia . Possible remnant LGIN seem clinically irrelevant consider exclusion criterion RFA complete endoscopic removal HGIN EAC . RFA consider best available ablation technique eradication residual BE mucosa focal EMR . On hand R0 resection HGIN EAC consider important complete histological evaluation specimen minimize risk overlook criterion advanced tumor stage ( e.g . cancerous infiltration lymphatic vessel submucosal tissue ) relate increase risk lymph node metastasis thus require major surgery . The risk advance lesion increase visible lumps nodule consist HGIN . In context consider poor inter-observer agreement among pathologist distinguish HGD intra-mucosal adenocarcinoma . Therefore primary objective study compare R0 resection rate ESD EMR visible lesion HGIN EAC . Secondary objective related completeness resection , safety procedure , medium term outcome comparison cost .</detailed_description>
