	<brief_summary>This within group , randomise , repeat dose , placebo- octreotide control study target population 45 healthy male subject . Subjects require attend clinical screening procedure 3 28 day dose commenced . The study conduct 4 group subject ; Groups 1 3 double-blinded , randomised design , consist 12 subject . Group 4 open-label design consist 9 subject . There minimum interval 96 h dose Groups 1 , 2 3 allow interim analysis PK safety/tolerability data dose escalation purpose . Group 4 ( active control group ) still proceed decision take prematurely stop dosing ITF2984 ( somatostatin analogue ) follow review PK safety data present interim decision meeting ; dose group conduct independently Groups 1 3 . On Days 1 6 , subject Groups 1 3 receive 2 dos investigational medicinal product ( IMP ) approximately 12 h apart ; subject Group 4 receive 3 dos IMP approximately 8 h apart . For group , subject schedule receive final dose IMP morning Day 7 . In addition , subject receive exogenous test administration ( stimulation test ) Day -1 , Day 1 Day 7 time day ( ie Day -1 , 23.5 h first dose IMP , Days 1 7 , 0.5 h first dose IMP respective day ) . Blood sample PD PK analyse take specified time point dose . Subjects remain site 10 day ( ie 36 h final dose IMP Day 7 ) provide discharge condition meet , return clinic 5 10 day last IMP administration follow-up visit .</brief_summary>
