	<brief_title>Phenotypic Properties Individuals Affected With XLHED</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study design incorporate two previously develop , non-invasive approach characterize phenotype individual affect XLHED . Facial 3-dimensional ( 3D ) imaging create white-field morphometric scanning ( Hammond , 2004 . The 3D facial photograph collect male ( age 4 year ) use develop non-invasive screening tool , could enable detection craniofacial sign XLHED newborn period . 3D facial profiling report effective identifying HED ( Dellavia et al. , 2008 ) , technology yet meet ease-of-use criterion universal screen tool . Standard 2-dimensional ( 2D ) frontal lateral facial photograph take XLHED-affected male subject well adult female ( age 18-45 yr ) risk XLHED carrier unaffected adult female control . The 2D facial photograph serve dual purpose ; first beta-test previously develop algorithm identify male affect XLHED ( Automatic Phenotype Identification XLHED Patients Final Report , December 25 , 2012 , unpublished ) , second adapt facial recognition algorithm identify female carrier XLHED .</detailed_description>
