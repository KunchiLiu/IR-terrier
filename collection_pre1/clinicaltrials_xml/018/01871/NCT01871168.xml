	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION The use peripheral nerve block become increasingly popular last two decade . With use anatomical landmark-based technique , peripheral nerve stimulators , ultrasound-guided technique , novel type nerve block make possible new indication well low risk complication patient . The transversus abdominis plane ( TAP ) block newly develop block involve nerve anterior abdominal wall . Recent publish clinical trial involve patient undergo major abdominal well gynaecological surgery , demonstrate promising result technique part multimodal post-operative pain treatment . There recent review article summarize result available study . This review article present brief summary method use TAP block . Clinical study effect TAP block post-operative pain systematically search review . Suggestions future assessment use TAP block discuss . McDonnell O'Donnell recently find series TAP Blocks place via triangle Petit effective reduce postoperative pain major abdominal surgery . Hebbard suggest place TAP block subcostal oblique approach surgery umbilicus . Our personal experience postoperative analgesia via TAP block patient undergo supraumbilical laparotomy coincide Dr. Hebbard 's opinion . This study propose place TAP catheter patient via subcostal oblique approach . Pain follow abdominal surgery largely derive abdominal wall incision . The anatomy abdominal wall nerve supply well describe . The anterior abdominal wall central lateral component . The central abdominal wall consist rectus sheath , include rectus abdominal muscle , associate fascial sheath . The lateral wall consist external oblique , internal oblique transversus abdominis muscle fascial sheath . Sensory supply anterior abdominal wall include skin , muscle parietal peritoneum derive anterior ramus lower six thoracic nerve first lumbar nerve . The nerve pass lateral fascial plane internal oblique transversus abdominis muscle term transversus abdominis fascial plane . These nerve block utilizing transversus abdominis plane block use double pop technique use ultrasound . Preliminary volunteer cadaveric study demonstrate potential TAP block produce dermatomal sensory block lower six thoracic first lumbar abdominal afferent . Postoperative analgesia patient undergo major abdominal surgery , hepatectomy , liver transplantation , Whipple 's Surgery issue debate anesthetic society . While epidural analgesia widely accept best method postoperative pain control major abdominal surgery , safety epidural catheter patient undergo liver pancreatic resection contest . Postoperative coagulopathy , develop extent every patient resection liver directly correlate amount liver resect , put patient risk develop spinal hematoma - particularly removal catheter . Coagulopathy also exist degree patient pancreatic cancer obstructive jaundice , therefore question safety epidural catheter patient debatable . As large dos anesthetic inject relatively vascular area TAP block , exist potential toxicity . Two recent study examine serum level lidocaine ropivacaine TAP block use standard local anesthetic volume find serum level consistent potential systemic toxicity . However , literature serum local anesthetic level continuous TAP block . Serum lidocaine plasma level measure patient randomize receive TAP block without intermittent local anesthetic bolusing postoperatively provide patient safety data procedure . OBJECTIVE To determine whether continuous transversus abdominis plane block run third postoperative day reduce patient postoperative pain score reduce amount intravenous morphine require major abdominal surgery quantify plasma lidocaine level . HYPOTHESIS Patients receive continuous TAP block lidocaine use less PCA morphine post-operatively compare patient receive placebo TAP catheter . METHODS Following Institutional Ethics Board Approval , forty patient undergo major abdominal surgery ( number choose accord previous similar study ) randomly allocate TAP block postoperative intermittent infusion 0.5-1.0 % lidocaine versus TAP block postoperative intermittent infusion placebo ( i.e . saline ) . All patient receive standard general anesthetic patient receive current postoperative analgesic standard care hospital , intravenous morphine PCA pump combine adjunctive medication . The presence severity pain , sedation nausea assess investigator blind group allocation . These assessment do one investigator 24 , 48 , 72 , 96 hour TAP blockade . Pain assess rest movement use visual analogue score . Sedation score shall assign awake alert=0 , quietly awake=1 , asleep easily aroused=2 , deep sleep=3 . Sedation define presence sedation score great 0 time point . Nausea define administration rescue antiemetic . Morphine requirement 24 , 48 , 72 , 96 hour assess patient . Also evaluate extra medication patient may require , time first bowel movement , time first mobilization , discharge date , complication wound infection , ileus , local anesthetic toxicity , catheter dislocation . All patient unilateral incision receive TAP catheter place intraoperatively surgeon . Under direct visualization , surgeon first close muscle layer transversus abdominis . Then standard nerve block catheter insert percutaneously lateral rectus abdominis muscle cephalad incision . The catheter place oblique direction along border 12th rib tip place far lateral incision allow without dissect tissue . The surgeon close muscle layer internal oblique catheter third layer close external oblique subcutaneous tissue closing skin . The catheter fix skin via specialized tap system , use secure nerve catheter , obliviating need suture catheter skin thus run risk occlude . In event surgical incision cross midline bilateral , surgeon place second TAP catheter method describe contralateral side . Our postoperative pain regimen include follow . All patient receive current standard care hospital , intravenous morphine PCA pump . Additionally patient able receive breakthrough dose i.v . morphine prn . All patient adjunctive medication order . Regarding infusion TAP catheter , patient receive intermittent bolus either lidocaine ( 0.5-1.0 % , discretion anesthesiologist ) placebo TAP catheter . For patient unilateral incision , bolus 20-40 ml apply every four eight hour pump . A KVO rate 1 ml per hour run throughout . Should necessary place catheter bilaterally , set second pump second catheter . This pump set identical setting , i.e . deliver 20-40 ml solution every four eight hour . Blood sample plasma lidocaine level already sit intravenous line 30 minute postoperatively , well immediately 30 minute one local anesthetic placebo bolus day three day postoperatively . The TAP catheter remove approximately 72 hour morning third postoperative day .</detailed_description>
