	<brief_summary>The incidence hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) recently increase United States . Although image play major role HCC screen staging , possibility predict HCC tumor grade , aggressiveness , angiogenesis hypoxia image unmet need . In addition , new antiangiogenic drug available treat advance HCC necessitate use new image criterion beyond size . The investigator would like develop validate non-invasive magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) method base advanced diffusion-weighted imaging ( DWI ) , MR Elastography , BOLD ( blood oxygen level dependent ) MRI perfusion-weighted imaging ( PWI , use gadolinium contrast ) use non-invasive marker major histopathologic feature HCC , predict assess early response HCC systemic therapy . The investigator also would like develop quality control tool improve quality decrease variability quantitative MRI metric . These technique combine could represent non-invasive correlate histologic finding HCC , could enable individualized therapy , provide prognosis patient HCC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The incidence hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) recently increase US mostly due increase chronic hepatitis C infection . Angiogenesis critical growth metastatic progression HCC . With development new antiangiogenic drug sorafenib , image method predict assess therapeutic response beyond change size become critical . However , validate image method predict assess early HCC response target agent lack . In study , investigator would like develop quantitative MRI method interrogate different feature HCC tumor biology pathology , include tumor cellularity , grade , angiogenesis hypoxia . The investigator propose multiparametric approach combine advanced DWI ( IVIM : intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion measure perfusion fraction true diffusion coefficient ) , DCE-MRI ( dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI , measure arterial portal flow , mean transit time , blood volume distribution volume ) , BOLD MRI use oxygen carbogen challenge . This protocol perform patient HCC undergo hepatic resection . Routine advance histopathologic method perform ( tumor grade , CK19 expression , presence microvascular invasion , VEGF expression , microvessel density , HIF 1-alpha expression ) . MRI metric correlate histopathologic metric . The first portion proposal involve development QC algorithm assess MR data quality test-retest . The investigator propose solution improve data acquisition processing . The last 2 year study dedicate prospective randomize study compare Yttrium 90 radioembolization sorafenib , assess role baseline MRI metric early change ( 2 week ) metric marker tumor response time progression patient unresectable HCC .</detailed_description>
