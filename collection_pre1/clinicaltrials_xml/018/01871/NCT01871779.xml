	<brief_summary>Cardiovascular disease remain one leading cause death Australia , account 47637 ( 36 % ) death 2004 . Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) category cardiovascular disease , characterise intermittent claudication . This define walk induced pain , cramping , ache , tiredness heaviness one leg go away continued walk relieve rest . It estimate 5-10 % individual age 50 year suffer claudication . The primary effective treatment patient focus improve walk ability functional status . Current research show approximately 30 % patient improve exercise , 30 % continue deteriorate rest show change . The change produce biochemical cellular level due exercise unknown . To help good understand , study ass entire range protein express exercise skeletal muscle tissue patient intermittent claudication . This help identify key protein role improve patient symptom outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Why clinical problem important ? Peripheral Arterial Disease ( PAD ) major health problem Australia , prevalence 15 % male age 65 year . The direct health care cost PAD Australia $ 180m 1994 , 78 % associate hospitalisation . PAD also marker advance cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) involve coronary , cerebral , renal aortic vessel ; 2-3 fold increase risk CVD-related mortality . In 2006-2007 , 25,813 hospitalization 2,163 death result PAD ( Australian Institute Health Welfare 2009 ) . The age Australian population prevalence PAD increase ( Australian Institute Health Welfare 2009 ) , national annual health expenditure cardiovascular disease likely increase , greatly exceed 5.4 billion dollar spend 2000-01 ( Australian Bureau Statistics 2006 ) . The frequent symptom mild moderate PAD intermittent claudication ( IC ) , define walking-induced pain cramp one leg ( often calve ) relieve rest . The primary effective treatment people intermittent claudication focus improve walk ability functional status . What already know effect exercise intermittent claudication ? The beneficial effect exercise train treatment confirm several randomise control trial . The optimum form exercise still n't elucidate . The mechanisms improvement claudication exercise largely unknown . Although exercise stimulate ischaemic-reperfusion ( I-R ) insult , repetitive exercise may produce adaptive response I-R insult . Other potential theme include effect exercise stimulate inhibit angiogenesis and/or muscle protein synthesis . Although principal cause IC reduce blood flow lower limbs relative increase demand exercise , pathophysiology IC completely understand . For example , limb haemodynamics closely correlate clinical presentation limitation peak exercise performance . Haemodynamic measure severity PAD , ankle-brachial systolic blood pressure index ( ABI ) blood flow strain gauge plethysmography , poor predictor exercise capacity patient IC . Cross-sectional study indicate inflammation associate presence , progression severity PAD . This may explain excess cardiovascular mortality , ( least 50 % 10 year ) , see patient . The effect exercise claudication study inflammatory marker peripheral blood . What importance measure protein expression muscle tissue ? While peripheral blood bio-markers help understand systemic manifestation claudication , reflect happen muscle microcirculation . Most change protein expression subtle detect peripheral blood . The ease acquisition correspond ease interrogation . The dynamic range protein serum make analysis challenge high abundance protein tend mask low abundance ; whilst small number protein include albumin , Beta 2-macroglobulin , transferrin , immunoglobulin may represent 90 % serum proteins11 . The protein complement cell tissue dynamic reflect age , life-cycle , condition cell subject specific disease state . It clear disease , protein subject numerous change include post-translational modification and/or proteolytic cleavage ; equally certain disease , alteration protein expression . Messenger ribonucleic acid ( mRNA ) molecule encode chemical blueprint protein . Yet micro array examine differential expression mRNA provide information post-translational modification , therefore way assess impact protein protein level . Some study investigate difference histochemical biochemical characteristic skeletal muscle patient PAD healthy age-matched subject . Most study muscle biopsy patient PAD demonstrate alteration muscle fibre type distribution , denervation alteration muscle metabolism insight protein expression12 , 13 , 14 . There considerable evidence metabolic status skeletal muscle perturb patient PAD compare age-matched healthy control . Amongst early observation unexpected find expression activity several mitochondrial enzyme increase skeletal muscle limb PAD . The skeletal muscle patient IC , change exercise current evidence shed light mechanism change change patient . We already know patient improve exercise others . A question thus arise whether exists bio-diversity patient ' response exercise . Armstrong et al studied disturbance calcium homeostasis skeletal muscle suggest might play key role development exercise-induced muscle damage . Some immediate muscle change exercise attribute protein degradation initiate non-lysosomal cysteine protease , calpain . The elevation intracellular calcium post-exercise activate calpains . Muscle tissue express three distinct calpains , include well-characterized ubiquitous calpains - m- calpain , Î¼-calpain n-calpain . Wang et al conclude , animal study , increased level protease m-calpain , promote muscle injury whereas calpastatin protein expression might execute protective function muscle injury . This yet investigate human study . It hypothesise level calpastatin m-calpain important explain variable response exercise IC patient improve others . There conflict evidence benefit exercise . Tsai et al find normal training effect glucose transporter 4 ( GLUT4 ) gene expression completely eliminate acute chronic ischemia pre-translational level . In addition , chronic ischemia-induced muscle atrophy see severe exercise-trained rat untrained rat . This result suggest individual impair microvascular condition , exercise training might beneficial maintain muscle mass . Thus effect exercise training human subject IC ( ischaemia ) yet elucidate . We know subject differ capacity exercise patient intermittent claudication different . Patients undergoing exercise intermittent claudication , would different term expression protein due exercise . For reason , patient would act control mean biopsy unaffected muscle individual . An open end mass spectroscopy examination proteins exercise skeletal muscle would give insight mechanistic pathway exercise effect intermittent claudication . What relation protein expression inflammation exercise intermittent claudication ? The clinical model exercise induce ischaemia-reperfusion type injury substantiate evidence marker inflammation . Neutrophils first cell begin accumulate tissue injury site , destroy necrotic tissue phagocytosis work conjunction resident macrophage muscle tissue . Neutrophil presence document muscle various type eccentric exercise . A study look neutrophil function exercise claudicants show increased neutrophil activation manifest increase expression neutrophil adhesion receptor cluster differentiation antigen IIb ( CD11b ) degranulation manifest increase plasma neutrophil elastase . This occur immediately exercise patient intermittent claudication . Whether equate trend predict outcome still clear . The protease m-Calpain chemotactic factor neutrophil may play role local systemic inflammatory response . Such adaptation cellular inflammatory response report earlier Kunimatsu et al . Together Calpastatin , proteins may hold key link local muscle damage , repair induce systemic inflammatory response . Chemical modification protein may play role pathogenesis disorder range diabetes atherosclerosis ischemia-reperfusion injury perhaps age process . Advanced Glycosylation End product ( AGEs ) end product glycosylation reaction sugar molecule bond either protein lipid molecule without enzyme control reaction . The formation accumulation AGEs implicate progression age related disease , particular cardiovascular disease . They range pathological effect , include inhibition vascular dilatation interfere nitric oxide ( Endothelium Derived Relaxation factor ) , bind macrophage endothelial cell induce secretion inflammatory cytokine enhance oxidative stress . We hypothesise exercise stimulates glucose uptake endothelial cell increase synthesis AGE 's . It remain determined whether exercise enhances reduce process . The aim study examine inflammatory biomarkers , include Interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , Neutrophil elastase Advanced Glycated End-products protein know influence tissue damage repair ( Calpains Calpastatin ) determine effect different form exercise process , order determine 1 . Is exercise appropriate patient ? i.e . 1 . Do patient respond pro inflammatory response ? 2 . Does exercise produce adaptive response patient ? 3 . Does exercise stimulate I-R insult patient reduce exercise training ? 4 . What local tissue response exercise term tissue damage repair ( measure protein analysis ) 2 . What best form exercise suitable patient ? 3 . Is biodiversity patient ' response exercise term 1 . Systemic inflammatory response ( base IL-6 , Neutrophil Elastase &amp; AGE 's ) ? 2 . Local response ( base protein analysis ) ? 4 . Does physiological response exercise patient reduce risk CVD relate morbidity/mortality ? . As evidenced change cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( CPET ) outcome parameter endothelial function . 5 . Is impaired endothelial function reversible ? . As measured flow-mediated dilatation . The combined use data systemic blood local muscle tissue would help characterise metabolic functional consequence age associate PAD change skeletal muscle . It would also help identify mechanistic pathway exercise exerts effect patient intermittent claudication .</detailed_description>
