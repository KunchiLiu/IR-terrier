	<brief_summary>In low oxygen environment , high-altitude , adult may become ill suffer acute mountain sickness . Further , adult find exercise becomes much difficult compare exercise lower altitude ( e.g . sea-level ) . The purpose investigation study effect new medicine call Aes-103 . A company call AesRx , LLC make medicine . The active ingredient medicine 5-Hydroxymethyl-2-Furfural ( 5HMF ) , naturally occur substance find coffee , honey , dry fruit , fruit juice , malt , barley , Balsamic vinegar caramel.The investigator believe Aes-103 may help people adjust high-altitude quickly prevent become ill . The purpose study determine Aes-103 promote endurance performance low oxygen environment healthy adult human . Aes-103 currently investigate AesRx , LLC ( Newton , MA ) collaboration National Heart , Lung Blood Institute NIH ( Bethesda , MD ) potential anti-sickling agent sickle cell disease . Sickle-cell disease characterize problem blood prevent blood cell carry oxygen . Aes-103 might able help blood cell carry oxygen . It reason investigator study believe Aes-103 might help people adjust high-altitude quickly . There know special safety consideration active ingredient Aes-103 ( 5-HMF ) . In recent , placebo control , clinical safety test , Aes-103 give single dos 300 mg , 1000 mg,2000 mg 4000 mg healthy normal volunteer . Additionally , toxicological effect Aes-103 study give acutely , sub-acutely , chronically rodent , 28 day dog . Based safety study , single dose Aes-103 expect significant negative/toxicological effect dos evaluate study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind blind , repeat measure ( cross-over ) study . Approximately 12 healthy adult men consume , random order , placebo prior exercise normoxia , placebo prior exercise hypoxia , 1000 mg Aes-103 prior exercise hypoxia , 3000 mg Aes-103 prior exercise hypoxia . Study participant report Human Performance/Clinical Research Laboratory ( HPCRL ) 6 separate occasion . On visit 1 study participant undergo screen ( e.g . medical history 12-lead electrocardiogram blood pressure rest incremental exercise volitional exhaustion ) , instruct avoid food drinks high 5-HMF ( e.g. , coffee , malt , barley , dry fruit , caramel ) least 3 day subsequent visit . Visit 2 comprise habituation visit subject give opportunity rehearse exercise test . Visits 3 , 4 , 5 6 , occur random order almost identical nature . Study participant abstain vigorous physical exercise alcohol consumption 24-hours prior visit . In addition , study participant abstain food beverage , except water , 4-hours prior visit 3 , 4 , 5 6 . On arrival subject instrument measurement heart rate , blood pressure blood oxygen saturation . Following baseline determination subject consume either : placebo , 1000 mg Aes-103 3000 mg Aes-103 . 45 minute consumption , participant enter environmental chamber , adjust randomly either normoxia ( 21 % oxygen ) hypoxia ( 15 % oxygen ) . The pair normoxia/hypoxia supplement follow : placebo + normoxia , placebo + hypoxia , 1000 mg + hypoxia , 3000 mg + hypoxia . Participants remain seated environmental chamber 15 minute , complete standardize warm-up bout exercise ( 100 W 30 minute ) follow brief time trial ( time take cycle 12.5 km ( ~7.75 mile ) ) . Heart rate , blood pressure blood oxygen saturation record every 5 minute . During exercise , subjective rating perceive exertion ( Borg Scale ) record every 10 minute , end-exercise .</detailed_description>
