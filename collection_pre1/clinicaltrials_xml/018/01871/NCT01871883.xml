	<detailed_description>Sensitive skin syndrome define presence burning , itch unpleasant sensation skin , due physical , chemical psychological factor . It frequently self-diagnosed condition , accurate test recognize quantify individual variation perception intensity relate symptom . Although pathogenesis sensitive skin syndrome completely understood , accept theory presence alter barrier function . Irritation result abnormal penetration substance deep layer skin , induce vasodilation stimulate c-type neuronal fiber . Also , change pH stratum corneum find induce skin sensitivity activation transient potential receptor vanilloid ( TRPV ) neuronal receptor . TRPV1 first discover 1997 , identify specific receptor capsaicin subgroup nociceptors . It non-selective thermo-sensitive cationic channel find nerve central peripheral nervous system , fibroblast , smooth muscle , mast cell , endothelial cell , gastrointestinal , respiratory urinary epithelial cell . TRPV1 activate excessive heat ( &gt; 42ÂºC ) , acidic pH ( &lt; 5.9 ) , also endogenous substance N- arachidonoyl dopamine , leucotriene B , phospholipase C , many others . In 2001 , functional expression TRPV1 identify human keratinocytes . Their physiologic role skin completely understood , related differentiation , proliferation , inflammation homeostasis epidermal barrier . Their presence keratinocytes cutaneous nervous fiber suggest role sensitive function epidermis . It prove stimulation TRPV1 neuronal cell induce pruritus burning sensation . In vitro study demonstrate exogenous stimulation TRPV1 keratinocytes induces release nitric oxide , ATP , dopamine , prostaglandin , pro-inflammatory substance act paracrine mediator keratinocytes cutaneous nerve fiber . Therefore , scientific base hypothesize increase expression receptor responsible sensitive skin syndrome .</detailed_description>
