	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well bevacizumab , fluorouracil , leucovorin calcium , oxaliplatin surgery work treat patient stage II-III rectal cancer . Monoclonal antibody , bevacizumab , block tumor growth different way . Some block ability tumor grow spread . Others find tumor cell help kill carry tumor-killing substance . Drugs use chemotherapy , fluorouracil , leucovorin calcium , oxaliplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop divide . Giving bevacizumab together fluorouracil , leucovorin calcium , oxaliplatin may effective treatment rectal cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bevacizumab , Fluorouracil , Leucovorin Calcium , Oxaliplatin Before Surgery Treating Patients With Stage II-III Rectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine six cycle modify fluorouracil , leucovorin calcium , oxaliplatin ( mFOLFOX7 ) plus bevacizumab ( Avastin ) yield complete pathologic response ( cPR ) 25 % primary tumor patient stage II III rectal cancer . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess rate tumor regression ( pathologic stage lower clinical stage ) 6 cycle mFOLFOX7 bevacizumab primary rectal cancer . II . To assess local recurrence rate 3 year 6 cycle mFOLFOX7 bevacizumab . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Correlation follow marker response ( define CPR stag ) : - Intratumoral Gene expression germline polymorphism gene involve vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) VEGF independent pathway ( VEGF , vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 [ VEGFR1 ] , VEGFR2 , interleukin-8 [ IL8 ] , chemokine ( C-X-C motif ) receptor 2 [ CXCR2 ] , intercellular adhesion molecule [ ICAM ] , VEGFR1 VEGFR2 , neuropilin 1 2 [ NRP1,2 ] , cluster differentiation [ CD ] 44 , aldehyde dehydrogenase [ ALDH ] , leucine-rich repeat immunoglobulin-like [ LRIG ] . - Circulating tumor cell ( CTC ) VEGF-factor A ( A ) CTC . II . Prediction surgical resection margin pretreatment magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive bevacizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-90 minute , oxaliplatin IV 2 hour , leucovorin calcium IV , fluorouracil IV continuously 46-48 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 14 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Within 6-8 week treatment , patient undergo surgery . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
