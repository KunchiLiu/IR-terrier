	<brief_summary>Injection local anesthetic drug effective way freeze ( block ) nerve achieve loss sensation surgery satisfactory pain control afterwards . Many study show nerve block associate high degree success control pain open inguinal hernia repair . Nerve block administer single injection long act local anesthetic agent use ultrasound guidance . This study compare different technique freeze nerve responsible pain open inguinal hernia repair . Patients randomize one two group . In first group , participant receive ultrasound-guided nerve block follow induction general anesthesia prior surgical procedure . In second group , participant receive local anesthetic injection directly wind surgeon prior closure . The investigator assess level pain control 48 hour surgical procedure . Patients provide additional medication pain relief necessary . The investigator also contact participant follow-up regard possible chronic groin pain 3 month follow surgical procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>US-guided Ilioinguinal Blocks Versus Local Infiltration</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>population . It well-known inguinal hernia surgery lead significant degree acute perioperative pain . At time , patient undergoing inguinal hernia operation increase risk develop chronic neuropathic groin pain . In literature , several approach prophylaxis treatment perioperative pain describe include : infiltration local anesthetic surgeon , ilioinguonal/iliohypogastric nerve block , neuroaxial blockade , caudal block pediatric petients . Recent study show ultrasound guide ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric nerve block associate increase level safety , improved success rate , reduction dose local anesthetic require compare `` blind '' technique . The aim study investigate role ultrasound guide ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric nerve block prevention perioperative persistent neuropathic pain follow open inguinal hernia repair comparison infiltration local anesthetic surgeon . In first randomize group patient perform ultrasound guide ilioinguinal/iliohypogastric nerve block use type amount local anesthetic . In second group , patient receive infiltration type amount local anesthetic surgeon .</detailed_description>
