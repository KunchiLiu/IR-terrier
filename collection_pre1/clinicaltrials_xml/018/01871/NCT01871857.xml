	<brief_summary>Research suggest hypertonic saline may improve mucous flow infant acute bronchiolitis . Data suggest trend favor reduce length hospital stay improve pulmonary score increase concentration nebulized solution 3 % 5 % saline compare 0.9 % saline mixed epinephrine . To knowledge , 7 % hypertonic saline previously investigate . OUr hypothesis 7 % hypertonic saline would improve bronchiolitis severity score admission rate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>7 % Hypertonic Saline Acute Bronchiolitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design A double-blinded , randomize , comparative , controlled trial conduct ED urban tertiary care center , annual census 70,000 patient visit . The Institutional Review Board approve study . Patient selection Informed consent obtain parent legal guardian patient enrol study . Patients age 6 week ≤ 18 month present ED October March 2-year period ( 2010-2012 ) bronchiolitis ( defined viral respiratory illness first episode wheeze ) BSS score ≥ 4 eligible study . Exclusion criterion previous history wheezing ; diagnosis asthma ; use bronchodilator within 2 h presentation ; gestational age ≤ 34 week ; history congenital heart disease , chronic pulmonary chronic renal disease ; oxygen saturation ≤ 85 % time recruitment ; severe disease require intensive care unit admission , inability obtain informed consent . Depending availability principal investigator ( pediatric emergency medicine fellow ) , convenience sample use recruit patient . The ED physicians staff notify fellow 's hour availability way call schedule post ED . Study protocol Eligible patient randomize one two group block 10 . The control group receive aerosol 0.5 ml 2.25 % racemic epinephrine 3 ml 0.9 % saline , study group receive 0.5 ml 2.25 % racemic epinephrine 3 ml 7 % HS . The treat clinician ED contact principal investigator within hour eligible patient 's arrival . The pharmacy department maintain box ED hold sequentially number , previously randomize concealed envelope contain either study ( 7 % HS ) control ( 0.9 % saline ) medication . After initial screen assessment consent obtain , patient administer medication via nebulization driven 6 L/min O2 flow . Research personnel , treat physician , staff perform BSS keep blind throughout process . Bronchiolitis severity score record prior administer aerosol , administer aerosol , treat clinician determine final disposition patient . After 4-h observation period , treat clinician determine patient disposition . If admit , patient continue receive aerosol contain designated medication every 6 h discharge 24 h admission . Bronchiolitis severity score obtain treatment . A standardized data sheet complete enrollment patient 's stay ED inpatient ward . Any co-interventions additional bronchodilator , supplemental oxygen , intravenous fluid , deep nasal suction discretion treat clinician . The clinician free withdraw patient study clinical deterioration warrant escalation care adverse effect relate medication observe . Outcome measure The BSS objective respiratory assessment tool previously validate ( Table 1 ) .14 We use modify BSS , use institution since 2006 , assess severity illness acute bronchiolitis . ( Table 2 ) A change modify BSS primary outcome .</detailed_description>
