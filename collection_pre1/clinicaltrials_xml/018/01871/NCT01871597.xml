	<brief_summary>Video assist thoracoscopic surgery ( VATS ) anatomical lung resection ( lobectomy pneumonectomy ) provide effective minimally invasive treatment stage 1 lung cancer . Currently , minority anatomical pulmonary resection perform VATS ( 15 % ) ( 6 ) . The technical difficulty danger VATS lobectomy relate pulmonary arterial branch manipulation main limitation many thoracic surgeon regard adoption VATS lobectomy . We believe decrease manipulation require surgeon pulmonary arterial branch , make procedure safe therefore prevalent anatomical pulmonary resection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pulmonary Artery Energy Sealing VATS Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We believe stress ( patient surgeon ) VATS anatomical lung resection originate manipulation pulmonary artery . Endostaplers utilized VATS seal pulmonary artery require lot space manipulation fragile vessel . Furthermore , artery must completely dissect surround tissue . This increase manipulation pulmonary artery procedure . Energy seal device require much less space dissection due size seal artery perform without complete dissection surround tissue . Thus , utilization energy seal device decrease excessive manipulation pulmonary arterial branch VATS anatomical lung resection render procedure easy safer . This decrease stress patient , also surgeon hopefully allow surgeon adopt minimally invasive technique prove superior ( length stay , cost care , pain , morbidity post-op , atrial fibrillation , quality life , systemic inflammation , ability receive adjuvant chemotherapy ) open thoracotomy . The intraoperative technique differ blood vessel ligation perform accord standard operative procedure either use stapler direct ligation pulmonary vessel . After resection delivery resect specimen patient , specimen examine vitro operative field non-sterile field operative room . The lobar pulmonary artery main segmental branch dissect . Canulation major segmental branch perform use arterial pressure monitoring catheter . The canulation secure ligation 2-0 silk suture . A three way valve attach directly arterial catheter . One branch three way valve attach controlled pressure syringe pump branch attach digital manometer . All segmental branch pulmonary artery ligate maintain pressure throughout catheterized segmental branch . Normal 25 mmHg pressure obtain inflate normal saline . The lobar pulmonary artery main segmental branch ' diameter measure use digital caliper adventitia adventitia inflated portion normal saline pressure 25 mmHg . The lobar pulmonary artery main segmental artery seal use one main energy seal ( Ligasure , Harmonic scalpel , Enseal , Thunderbeat , unipolar conventional bipolar cautery application metal Hem-o-lok clip ) . The sealing perform normal 25 mmHg intra-arterial pressure . In bipolar sealing , arterial wall compress energy device jaw complete seal achieve . The artery divide utilizing fine scissors . In pulmonary arterial branch seal Harmonic scalpel , Thunderbeat Enseal , arterial wall seal divide sealing step . In Unipolar cautery arterial sealing , DeBakey forceps utilized compress arterial wall together seal perform direct application unipolar cautery forceps . Complete seal achieve complete carbonization arterial wall . The artery divide scissors seal . After division pulmonary artery , normal saline solution inject controlled pressure syringe pump achieve intraluminal pressure bursting pressure reach . Intraluminal pressure record bursting pressure register . The resected specimen divide 8 group accord type sealing perform ; ( Ligasure , Harmonic scalpel , Enseal , Thunderbeat , Unipolar conventional bipolar cautery , Metal clip , Hem-o-lok clip )</detailed_description>
