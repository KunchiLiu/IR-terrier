	<brief_summary>This research do assess effectiveness weight loss program woman early stage breast cancer whose body mass index ( BMI ) overweight obese range ( &gt; 25 ) . Weight loss beneficial improve cardiovascular risk factor overall health , may also decrease chance breast cancer come back . A weight loss counsel program study general population find effective help reduce weight 2 year period . The main goal study determine woman recent diagnosis early breast cancer also lose weight program . To good understand effect weight loss woman breast cancer , compare pattern blood breast tissue sample ( tissue biopsies optional ) , questionnaires evaluate different aspect one 's well-being , dietary intervention intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>POWER-remote Weight Loss Program Early Stage Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence obesity increase rapidly recent year . Epidemiological study since 1970 's strongly suggest excess body weight gain may major risk factor many cancer include breast cancer . In addition , diagnose breast cancer , woman overweight obese experience bad outcome despite standard local adjuvant therapy . Furthermore , woman gain weight follow diagnosis breast cancer , weight gain may increase risk recurrence 40-50 % breast cancer-related mortality 53-60 % . A great deal effort make many year explain relationship obesity breast cancer . Molecularly , relationship involve dynamic complex interaction milieu hormone , cytokine , adipokines , affect cell signal potentially epigenetic pathway . Recently , study postmenopausal woman show weight loss modulates cytokines adipokines favorably . Inflammation associate obesity also characterize pathologically macrophage surround necrotic adipocytes call crown-like structure ( CLS ) . Furthermore , increase central obesity measure waist-to-hip ratio , may associate hypermethylation certain breast cancer gene , physical activity reduce methylation certain breast cancer-associated gene . The Women 's Intervention Nutrition Study ( WINS ) demonstrate woman early-stage breast cancer receive conventional cancer management randomize dietary intervention group low risk relapse compare control group lose weight . While woman diagnosis breast cancer therefore recommend maintain ideal body weight , limited progress make develop feasible weight loss program . However , collaborator Welch Center Prevention , Epidemiology , Clinical Research Johns Hopkins University recently report impressive sustained weight loss randomize control trial designate Practice-based Opportunities Weight Reduction ( POWER ) obese woman least one cardiovascular risk factor use remote-support weight loss intervention . The overall goal study determine effectiveness remote-support weight loss intervention POWER study , designate POWER-remote , woman early breast cancer overweight obese , assess effect weight loss ≥5 % body weight 6 month biomarkers associated obesity , inflammation , breast cancer . The data use implement clinical intervention available overweight obese woman breast cancer , design definitive study assess impact weight loss biomarker modulation risk recurrent disease development new primary breast cancer .</detailed_description>

History another prior cancer within last 5 year , exception another breast cancer , adequately treat conebiopsied situ carcinoma cervix uterus , basal squamous cell carcinoma skin Medical condition likely hind accurate measurement weight , include condition : weight loss contraindicate , would likely cause weight loss , would affect adipokine inflammatory marker ( e.g. , end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) dialysis , cirrhosis , autoimmune disease , adrenal disease , history bariatric surgery ) . The use follow medication exclude : insulin sulfonlyureas ; patient thyroid disease stable dos thyroid medication least past 6 month ; medication cause weight loss ( e.g. , topiramate , bupropion , exenatide , lorcaserin , phentermine orlistat ) within past 3 month ; medication likely cause weight gain prevent weight loss ( e.g. , corticosteroid , lithium , olanzapine , risperidone , clozapine , oral contraceptive pill , hormone replacement therapy ) within past 3 month ; medication may affect adipokine inflammatory marker ( e.g. , sulfonylurea , glitazones , insulin , steroid , ACE inhibitor , beta blocker statin ) unless start ≥3 month prior enrollment , chronic NSAIDS ( define use ≥3 time week ) ≥1 month . Pregnant nursing within past 6 month , plan become pregnant next year Currently enrol plan enroll weight loss program ( e.g. , Innergy , Weight Watchers , Jenny Craig , Nutrisystem , Medifast ) .</criteria>
