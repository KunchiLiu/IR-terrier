	<brief_title>Periimplant Mucosa Dynamics Around Divergent Concave Atlantis Abutment Transition Profiles</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , prospective , control clinical trial compare facial gingival profile around Atlantis™ abutment either linear `` divergent '' `` concave '' transitional profile facial proximal aspect abutment . Sixty study subject require replacement single-rooted tooth implant-supported restoration recruit . The Osseospeed™ Plus implant place 60 subject , use Uni healing abutment minimize lateral tissue displacement healing . After implant placement , final impression obtain ( 8 week post-placement ) , subject randomize either `` divergent '' `` concave '' transmucosal abutment design . For fabrication experimental abutment , Atlantis™ engineer initially design control `` divergent '' prototype modify concavity facial proximal transition zone obtain abutment otherwise retain feature control abutment . Engineers measure linear topographical change ( ΔL=Lc-Ld ) transition zone , well volumetric change ( x ) mid-facial aspect abutment induce formation submucosal concavity . The primary outcome study apico-coronal change peri-implant mucosal zenith prosthesis delivery one year .</detailed_description>
