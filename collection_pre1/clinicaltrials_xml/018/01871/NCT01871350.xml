	<brief_summary>Weight loss muscle waste commonly occur patient cancer , negatively influence quality life , treatment response survival . Weight loss report side effect chemotherapy treatment cancer . Weight change may consequence energy imbalance disturbance protein metabolism ( different factor link chemotherapy ) , reduce caloric protein intake ( partly relate depression ) , poor treatment tolerance , hormonal alteration , systemic inflammation etc . This result body composition modiﬁcations favor fat gain and/or lean body mass loss early stage cancer loss fat mass lean mass advance cancer . Depletion lean tissue cancer patient relate short survival , decrease skeletal muscle mass function may result fatigue inactivity , contribute fat mass change responsible chemo-toxicity increase mortality . Gains muscle mass difficult achieve cancer unless specific metabolic abnormality target . Recently , investigator observe essential amino acid mixture ( EAA ) able induce protein anabolism patient stage III IV non-small cell lung cancer . Previous experimental research clinical study cachectic condition ( include cancer ) indicate polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) able attenuate protein degradation improve anabolic response feed decrease acute phase response . Eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) ( combination docosahexaenoic acid ( DHA ) ) show effectively inhibit weight loss several disease state ; however , weight muscle mass gain present minimal . Recent study examine effect fish oil supplementation relation chemotherapy inconclusive find potential beneficial effect physical performance increase efficacy first-line chemotherapy patient non-small cell lung cancer . It investigators ' hypothesis supplementation milk protein ( contain essential amino acid ) carbohydrate ( CHO ) mixture combination fish oil supplementation target metabolic alteration cancer patient receive chemotherapy , attenuate negative effect chemotherapy gut function , muscle mass muscle function , cognition ; lead reduce toxicity chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nutrition Intervention During Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For cancer subject , study involve 1 test day prior chemotherapy treatment , 10-week ( ± 2 week ) nutritional intervention period home start first day chemotherapy treatment , one test day intervention . Chemotherapy general last least month . Recent study indicate 10-week nutritional supplementation period long enough reach significant improvement nutritional clinical outcome parameter chemotherapy . Throughout 10 week cancer subject take supplement home . Cancer subject randomly assign receive either fish oil placebo protein placebo take supplement daily throughout 10 week chemotherapy . For healthy subject , study involve one test day ( approx . 8 hour ) . On test day , response protein meal examine subject receive mixture amino acid little bit heavy normal , call stable isotope . Subjects also ingest sugar drink ass gut permeability . In total , approximate 120 ml blood drawn test day ass outcome measure . The investigator ' also collect urine 8 hour , cancer subject ask collect fecal sample day test day . After complete nutritional intervention study , cancer subject monitor 6 month via 2 phone call physician part clinical care . Between 6 month 2 year completion study , information disease progression ( survival ) obtain physician .</detailed_description>
