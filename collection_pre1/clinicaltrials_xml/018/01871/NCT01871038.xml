	<brief_summary>To determine effectiveness rotavirus vaccine , active surveillance conduct two site , Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center ( CCHMC ) Cincinnati , Ohio Medical University South Carolina ( MUSC ) Charleston , South Carolina . Children born April 1 , 2006 present CCHMC inpatient short-stay Emergency Department ( ED ) visit acute gastroenteritis ( AGE ) and/or fever approach enrollment . Children eligible vomit and/or diarrhea less equal 10 day duration . Data include demographic information , illness characteristic socio-economic status collect patient . A sample patient 's stool collect within 14 day onset symptom . Stool specimens test rotavirus antigen Rotaclone CCHMC . All rotavirus positive stool specimen type common G P serotypes . Using child identify rotavirus case child rotavirus negative control , conduct case control study assess effectiveness rotavirus vaccine , particular Rotarix .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rotarix Vaccine Effectiveness</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A case-control design utilized ass effectiveness RV1 prevent rotavirus-associated hospitalization Emergency Department ( ED ) visit use case control 2009-2012 rotavirus season . Vaccine exposure among case compare vaccine exposure among control . There one case group one control group . Cases obtain child enrol active surveillance acute gastroenteritis conduct two initial surveillance site . These site include : Cincinnati Children 's Hospital Medical Center ( 2009-2012 ) Medical University South Carolina ( 2009-2012 ) . Cases control identify retrospectively 2008-2011 season prospectively active surveillance 2011-2012 season . The active surveillance program conduct prospective surveillance hospitalization ED visit due AGE ( acute gastroenteritis ) child &lt; 6 year age . Even though Rotarix commercially available January 1 , 2008 , actual date RV1 initially use varied across site . The date Rotarix initially use determine site examination data . Children laboratory-confirmed rotavirus infection ( bulk stool sample positive rotavirus use rotavirus EIA ) include case bear 2 month prior initial date Rotarix availability site . The vaccine record case obtain determine vaccine status child . Controls child bear 2 month prior availability Rotarix site enrol active surveillance program either site test negative rotavirus . Children previously hospitalize diarrhea , sibling enrol study , recently move study area ( might eligible vaccine ) exclude . Laboratory Testing For child enrol active surveillance program bulk stool specimen obtain within 14 day visit AGE symptom test use Rotaclone , commercial enzyme immunoassay ( Meridian Bioscience , Inc ) CCHMC . Children positive test rotavirus eligible case child negative test rotavirus eligible control . Specimens positive EIA rotavirus G P genotyping do CCHMC . Retrospective Enrollment Children Tested Rotavirus Part Routine Care With dramatic decline rotavirus since introduction rotavirus vaccine , number child enrol surveillance plummet compare pre-licensure surveillance . In order improve sample size , retrospectively invite child rotavirus test do August 1 , 2008 June 30 , 2012 participate study . The laboratory record rotavirus test review identify child date birth &gt; August 1 , 2008 . Once identify , letter send parents/guardians brief explanation study ask notify u within two week wish call . Study staff contact parent/guardian explain study determine whether child meet eligibility criterion ( outline enrollment surveillance ) . If child meet eligibility criterion , parents/guardians ask allow child participate , informed consent obtain child . If agree , data collect prospectively enrolled child collect permission obtain contact child 's health care provider child 's immunization record . Eligibility The date Rotarix initially use determine site . Children bear 2 month prior initial date later eligible case control study . If child enrol season , visit child test positive rotavirus select inclusion ; child test negative visit , child 's final visit select inclusion . Sample Size Sample size calculation do vary degree vaccine efficacy vaccine coverage . With vaccine uptake 20 % , 68 case would allow detection vaccine effectiveness 80 % assume two-sided test significance level 0.05 80 % power . If vaccine uptake 30 % 44 case would need detect vaccine effectiveness 80 % . One must take consideration case control may incomplete immunization series . If sufficient number case , one dose vaccine efficacy also examine . Statistical Analysis Analyses perform use SAS® ( Version 9.2 Cary , NC ) . Demographic risk factor variable examine . Continuous , parametric data present mean ± standard deviation ( SD ) ; continuous , non-parametric data present median ( inter-quartile range ) . Categorical data present frequency ( percentage ) category . Continuous , parametric data analyze ANOVA Student 's t-test . Categorical data analyze chi-square Fisher 's Exact Test appropriate . Logistic Regression use estimate Vaccine Effectiveness ( VE ) 95 % confidence interval ( CIs ) adjust odds ratio ( aORs ) use formula VE = ( 1-aOR ) X 100 . Cases control matched age , enrollment date , geographic region . Cases compare matched control order evaluate effectiveness full ( 2 dos ) partial ( 1 dose ) vaccination . Initially , univariate conditional logistic regression analysis perform determine covariates include multivariable analysis . The explanatory variable interest vaccination status . If sample size permit , vaccine effectiveness calculate serotype . Other possible covariates include : date birth , age onset , season , insurance status ( public/none versus private ) point care ( hospital ED ) . Variables p-values ≤ 0.20 select candidate multivariable analysis . Multicollinearity among covariates examine evaluate variance inflation factor . If collinearity present , one correlate variable enter model time . Analysis rerun choose alternative correlate variable model compare . The model low Akaike information criterion ( AIC ) choose final model . Model selection include stepwise , forward selection , backwards elimination . The Hosmer-Lemeshow test use determine goodness fit .</detailed_description>
