	<brief_summary>The objective outpatient research study ( 1 ) ass ability automate system operate subject limited professional oversight ; ( 2 ) ass whether new device ( Dexcom Gen 4 sensor , Motorola ES400 smart phone , iDex pump controller ) reduce frequency hardware data communication lapse see previous system ; ( 3 ) measure degree glucose control achievable automated system . The system adjust blood glucose administer insulin glucagon . Insulin hormone lower blood glucose give nearly continuously study . Glucagon raise blood glucose automatically administer hypoglycemia . Both natural hormone make people without diabetes . Each subject four device place abdomen : two Omnipod insulin pump , one delivering insulin one delivering glucagon , two Dexcom G4 glucose sensor measure glucose . The two sensor fee glucose data Motorola smart phone master controller , calculate correct amount insulin glucagon deliver . The system send command correct Omnipod iDex pod controller . In new system , research subject able monitor progress study use smart phone graphical user interface . The subject companion him/her entire study safety purpose . Both subject companion complete training course treat diabetic emergency operate system . A study physician technician hotel study monitoring study via cloud-based data communication system . These study carry hotel setting .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Artificial Pancreas Control System Outpatient Setting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective current human study verify component Artificial Pancreas Control Software outpatient study . This master controller software design use conjunction two subcutaneous continuous glucose monitor system regulate blood glucose level well two Omnipod pump , one administer insulin one administering glucagon . The sensor communicate wirelessly two sensor receiver interfaced APC wireless USB connection . The insulin glucagon pump control APC wireless USB connection . The algorithm include APC automate version Adaptive Proportional Derivative ( APD ) insulin glucagon control algorithm , previously study investigational device . The Automated APD study vivo ( 13 experiment , 28 hr length , automate adjustment pump ) serious adverse effect note . The APC test vivo 28 hour experiment outpatient set preparation home testing .</detailed_description>
