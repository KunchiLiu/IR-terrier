	<brief_summary>Morbid obesity associate metabolic disease rise United States . Currently , best treatment obesity bariatric surgery roux-en-Y gastric bypass sleeve gastrectomy offer substantial weight loss . Unfortunately , 20 % patient undergo bariatric surgery fail lose enough weight define less 50 % excess body weight loss regain weight . For patient fail lose weight bariatric surgery fail maximal medical therapy diet supervision , treatment re-operation revision . Re-operation abdomen carry significant postoperative morbidity mortality . The investigator propose use Apollo OverStitch endoscopic suture device already approve FDA option bariatric surgery revision without re-operate patient . The investigator believe endoscopic technique may able provide weight loss without re-operate patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Endoscopic Surgery Bariatric Revision After Weight Loss Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The effective weight loss procedure United States roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) sleeve gastrectomy ( SG ) majority perform laparoscopically . Estimated excess body weight loss ( EBWL ) &gt; 50 % end one year . However , nearly 20 % patient fail meet estimate EBWL may experience weight gain recidivism . The first step nutritional counseling , medically supervise diet , medical therapy . Surgery would still fail lose weight despite aforementioned effort . It hypothesize failure weight loss RYGB gastrojejunostomy ( GJ ) dilation define &gt; 2 cm . Surgical treatment would require revision dilation . Unfortunately many revision procedure do laparoscopically give dense intra-abdominal adhesion . This require conversion open surgery morbidly obese patient thus raise postoperative morbidity mortality estimate range 15 % -50 % . The investigator propose use endoscopic suture device design Apollo EndoSurgery decrease GJ dilation 5-6 mm thus cause restriction , delay food transit time , promote early satiety . These effort limit overall caloric intake thereby promote weight loss . It think patient previous SG may dilation stomach . The investigator propose pyloric cerclage use Apollo EndoSurgery suture device decrease open pylorus thus achieve goal investigator propose RYGB revision . Endoscopic procedure day procedures little morbidity mortality compare laparoscopic open bariatric surgery revision .</detailed_description>
