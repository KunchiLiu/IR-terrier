	<brief_title>Study Looking End Expiratory Pressure Altitude Illness Decrease ( SLEEP-AID )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The specific aim study evaluate inexpensive disposable end-expiratory pressure device prevent acute mountain sickness ( AMS ) . AMS common disorder find 25-75 % hiker trekker N. America Europe expediently ascend high altitude ( &gt; 8,000 ft ) . This environmental malady insidious onset prevention necessary limit progression severe fatal disease , also limit physiologic deterioration seek enjoyment employment high altitude . One hallmarks healthy sick individual sleep high altitude oscillate pattern respiration mark period hyperventilation alternate apnea hypopnea . This distress `` periodic breathing '' pattern lead feel suffocation , prevents restful sleep , hypoxic event may well worsen ensue AMS . Prior study find positive end-expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) effective non-pharmacologic method prevent nocturnal desaturations decrease AMS incidence severity . Traditionally , PEEP device cumbersome expensive , show promising efficacy , limited cost portability useful non-pharmacologic option AMS prophylaxis . The SLEEP-AID methodology design prospectively enroll participant , randomize double blind placebo-controlled fashion either intervention [ Theravent ( Ventus Medical ) single use , inexpensive , small ] visually identical `` sham '' placebo group , gather physiologic data accurately reflect sleep pattern high altitude traveler objective well subjective outcome intervention . The benefit approach provide definitive data large diverse cross section real hike population generalizable majority ten million hiker , climber , high altitude tourist United States , Europe , Asia , South America .</detailed_description>
