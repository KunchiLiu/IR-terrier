	<criteria>Must pathologically confirm diagnosis World Health Organization ( WHO ) Criteria MDS , CMML , acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) ( except acute promyelocytic leukemia ) &lt; 30 % bone marrow blast ( RAEBt French American British criterion ) Hypomethylating agent ( azacitidine and/or decitabine ) failure , define lack response , disease progression , loss response , intolerance deem study investigator Adequate renal function , evidence serum creatinine ≤ 2 time institutional upper limit normal Adequate hepatic function , evidence serum bilirubin &lt; 2 time institutional upper limit normal aspartic transaminase ( AST ) alanine transaminase ( ALT ) &lt; 2 time institutional upper limit normal . Indirect hyperbilirubinemia due Gilbert 's disease hemolysis permit . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 2 Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document Patients history prior therapy another investigational agent within 4 week first plan dose PF0444913 Patients may receive investigational agent . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition PF04449913 Prior therapy another hedgehog inhibitor Concurrent use agent MDS , CMML , AML . Growth factor use epoetin , darbepoetin , granulocyte colonystimulating factor must terminate least 2 week initiation study treatment . Any uncontrolled concurrent illness would , opinion investigator , limit compliance study requirement Second malignancy require active therapy A prolong correct QT interval ( QTc ) ≥480 ms interval electrocardiogram History metastatic cancer diagnose less 2 year prior first plan dose PF0444913 Uncontrolled concurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement Pregnant woman exclude study PF04449913 smoothen inhibitor potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother PF04449913 . Breastfeeding discontinue mother treat PF04449913 . Patients immune deficiency increase risk lethal infection treat marrowsuppressive therapy . Therefore , HIVpositive patient receive combination antiretroviral therapy exclude study possible pharmacokinetic interaction PF04449913 .</criteria>
