	<brief_summary>In project investigator evaluate benefit contemporary dance training use comprehensive test battery combine standard neuropsychological battery , psychological questionnaire emotion , empathy quality life , structural magnet-resonance tomography ( MRI ) , well psychophysical test movement recognition agency , sense control one 's movement . For 10 year two experience dancer‚Äêchoreographers lead dance workshops people Huntington 's Disease ( HD ) family caregiver Paris . This project evaluate objectively effect workshop , assess new group 18 patient partner caregiver 8 month weekly dance training . People HD trouble involuntary movement , however accurately aware , moreover become impaired recognising instrumental action others . It well known observe somebody else 's action execute action rest common neural network . This might mean improve one 's action execution improve observation understand others ' action turn . Here , investigator investigate impact movement impairment cause HD might patient well partner caregiver , consequence fact action representation share . After 8 month contemporary dance training , group test , order establish action execution ( self ) perception ( others ) improve . Other recent psychophysics brain imaging experiment demonstrate sense agency compose external cue ( example sound ) consequences movement , internal sensorimotor information result action plan . Importantly , HD latter input might impair , never systematically test . Making use psychophysics paradigm disentangle two cue agency investigator first monitor sense movement HD , ass change agency role cue agency eight month contemporary dance practice . Finally investigator monitor structural brain change accompany progress , compare brain regular dance practice correlate action recognition psychophysics measure agency change . In sum , project double impact . Firstly scientifically evaluate impact dance normal especially brain affected neurodegenerative disease cause movement impairment , establish effect behaviour wellbeing . Secondly evaluate patient partner caregiver represent patient ' well movement change dance practice .</brief_summary>
