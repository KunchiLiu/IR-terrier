	<brief_title>Comparing Effectiveness Combined Hyperthermia External Beam Radiation ( EBRT ) Versus EBRT Alone Treating Patients With Painful Bone Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study conduct comparative data efficacy low temperature ( 40-43℃ range ) deep hyperthermia add external beam radiation treatment metastatic bone tumor . There 3 reason conduct clinical trial . Firstly , radiotherapy effective modality bony metastasis treatment , limited radiation dose deliver metastatic bony metastatic site relatively short response duration observe clinically . Since palliative treatment pain relief , patient develop recurrent pain lesion month later . Most patient must accept hopeless condition accept toward end life due difficulty reirradiation . There urgently need effective treatment . Secondly , combination hyperthermia radiation trial relatively high dose radiation , basic idea hyperthermic radiosensitization , combination hyperthermia radiotherapy bone metastasis warrant . Clinical trial experience relatively less deep tumor breast , head neck cancer , extremity sarcoma melanoma may apply deep seat tumor . Bony metastases usually deep seated lesion hard cortex bone surround . The real benefit hyperthermia highlight bony metastasis . Thirdly , metastatic bony microenvironment critical provide bone marrow-derived immune suppressor cell circulate systemic tumor microenvironment , mild thermal therapy metastatic bony microenvironment may dual immunomodulatory effect : direct enhancement immune cell activity thermally sensitive molecular pathway associate immune cell function/activation , , indirect enhancement immunosurveillance reduction hypoxia-induced immune suppressor cell around metastatic focus via improved tumor vascular perfusion . An unexpected survival benefit may demonstrate study . Patients stratify accord solitary multiple site , primary cancer type ( Breast prostate v others ) , severity pain ( i.e. , bad pain score last 24-hour period ) ( 4-6 v 7-10 ) . Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . Treatment protocol A design compare response match tumor patient treated radiation alone radiation combine hyperthermia patient multiple tumor . Two tumor comparable size treat either protocol A B , response compare . The tumor size compute product maximum length time maximum width .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histologically clinically confirm solid tumor metastasis index lesion involve abut bone . *Index lesion mean irradiated field cover lesion contour CTSimulation may generally less 20cm , include 45 vertebra body , sacrum plus adjacent iliac lesion segment femerol bone . Each patient one index lesion study . Index lesion bone destruction either osteolytic osteoblastic nature assess CT MRI image If nature metastatic disease previously document , index lesion treat require documentation ( i.e. , biopsy ) ≥ One primary painful metastatic site . The painful site need treatment first elect index lesion site evaluation response . Additional less painful metastatic site may present . Patients elect another course RT treatment different metastatic site initial treatment allow . Worst pain last 24 hour must ≥ 4 010 numeric scale . Index lesion cause clinical radiographic evidence partial spinal cord cauda equina compression/effacement allow . Have develop pain persistent pain stable chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , target therapy bisphosphonate therapy regimen allow . There change chemotherapy , hormonal therapy , bisphosphonate therapy 4 week radiotherapy ECOG performance status 03 Life expectancy ≥ 3 month Patients impend fracture weight bear bone patient symptoms spinal cord compression surgical opinion start radiotherapy . Patient able enrol study surgery schedule . Index lesion involve skull Index lesion evidence pathologic fracture , impend fracture need immediate surgery eligible . Those patient receive decompression surgery eligible . Has undergone prior radiotherapy index lesion Those chemotherapy systemic treatment change study period . Patients history metal implant inside outside irradiation field eligible . Patients history pacemaker insertion due arrhythmia eligible .</criteria>
