	<brief_summary>Background : - Healthy people white blood cell protect bacteria , virus , fungi . However , people disease cause body make white blood cell work properly . These white blood cell attack body protein . These type disease call anti-cytokine autoantibody-associated disease . They cause severe illness even death . They also difficult treat standard drug . - Rituximab drug use treat rheumatoid arthritis . It attack white blood cell work properly . Currently , approve treat anti-cytokine autoantibody-associated disease . However , researcher think may able help treat people immune disease . Objectives : - To see rituximab safe effective treatment anti-cytokine autoantibody-associated disease . Eligibility : - Individuals least 18 year age anti-cytokine autoantibody-associated disease . - Participants must also enrol related immune disorder study National Institutes Health . Design : - The study last 24 month . Participants take rituximab 6 month follow-up visit remain 18 month . - Participants screen physical exam medical history . Blood urine sample collect . Other sample collect needed participant currently infection . - Participants enter hospital 1 week start treatment . They four dos rituximab give 2 day apart . This first treatment monitor frequent blood test . - Over next 6 month , participant four dos rituximab give 1 month apart . Treatment monitor frequent blood test sample collection need . - There four follow-up study visit 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 month last dose rituximab .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Anticytokine autoantibody important emerge cause disease . Anticytokine autoantibody-associated disease include disseminate nontuberculous mycobacterial infection cause anti-interferon- &gt; = autoantibody , severe mucocutaneous candidiasis cause anti-interleukin-17 autoantibody , pulmonary alveolar proteinosis cause anti-granulocyte macrophage colony stimulate factor autoantibody . Many subject undergo treatment related disease fail respond develop toxicity long term therapy . Rituximab , anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody target antibody-producing B cell , use successfully treat autoimmune disease ( e.g. , rheumatoid arthritis ) , well syndrome cause pathogenic anticytokine autoantibody ( e.g. , myasthenia gravis pemphigus vulgaris ) . This phase I , single arm , open-label study evaluate safety clinical response rituximab treatment subject ( great equal 18 year age ; n=20 ) anticytokine autoantibody-associated disease intolerant refractory conventional treatment . Rituximab administer intravenous infusion 1 gram day 1 15 , subsequently indicate month 5 month ( plus minue 5 day visit ) start approximately day 42 . Follow-up visit occur within 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 , 18 month ( plus minus 2 week visit ) last infusion . Subjects maintain background appropriate therapy respective disease . The safety clinical response rituximab assess clinical laboratory parameter subject receive rituximab , additional year half completion treatment .</detailed_description>
