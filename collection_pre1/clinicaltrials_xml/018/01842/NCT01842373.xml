	<detailed_description>Lasers effectively utilized facial rejuvenation , reduction photoinduced rhytides , dyschromia . Topical anesthetic use minimize discomfort associate laser induced thermal pain . There currently several formulation topical anesthesia . However , study compare product limit especially new formulation claim increase efficacy faster onset . LMX4 ( Ferndale Laboratories , Ferndale , Michigan ) counter topical anesthesia . It 4 % lidocaine formulate multilamellar vesicle contain several lipid bilayers . This unique liposomal-based delivery system report deliver great concentration drug . This result long duration activity faster onset action without require occlusion.4 Liposomes assist drug penetration skin lipid bilayer encapsulate drug . BLT compound topical anesthetic contain 20 % benzocaine , 6 % lidocaine , 4 % tetracaine . It commonly prescribe topical anesthesia . All BLT product compound University Physicians Center Pharmacy ensure safety uniformity . Anecdotally , physician claim topical anesthesia choice prior laser surgery . The objective study evaluate clinical efficacy topical anesthetic compound prior fractional skin resurfacing .</detailed_description>
