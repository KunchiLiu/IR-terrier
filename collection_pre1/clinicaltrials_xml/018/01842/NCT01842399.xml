	<detailed_description>Resveratrol find leave skin grape , peanut root plant polygonum cupsidatum . Although use since early year Indian Ayurvedic Chinese medicine , come prominence 1990 believe major reason positive effect wine cardiovascular health French Paradox . Since , study show resveratrol affect number key cellular pathway molecular target wide range biological effect . Noted among effect blood vessel , cancer , blood clotting , blood sugar control , muscle activity inflammation . Resveratrol also may produce effect decrease food intake , perhaps action molecule body call Sirtuin , important one approach consistently demonstrate beneficial effect age process . Resveratrol action pharmacology extensively studied test tube , cell , animal explore fully people . The animal study include recent NIA-conducted study monkey demonstrate reduction stiffness blood vessel several week . Phase 1 2 clinical study healthy human volunteer patient type II diabetes mellitus begin identify possible role resveratrol nutritional supplement compound appear harmful effect dose 5 gram per day . We perform 12-month , Phase 1/2 trial resVida ( oral preparation resveratrol ) 90 overweight/obese people age 50 ( 30 group ) . The primary endpoint vascular stiffness ( measure Pulse Wave Velocity ) secondary endpoint exercise capacity measure oxygen utilization ( VO2max ) . Testing do level resveratrol blood different dos compound . The study also include measurement change blood glucose level , inflammation , exercise capacity . These study provide necessary information test resVida compound could promote healthy aging .</detailed_description>
