	<brief_summary>Thoracotomy , surgical procedure perform routinely connection pulmonary surgery . Pain induce thoracotomy consider severe post-operative pain . Control pain essential perioperative management . Nowadays , several strategy support pain , include regional anesthesia technique context multimodal analgesia . Epidural analgesia reduces pain score respiratory complication significantly . ParaVertebral Block ( PVB ) technique effective epidural analgesia treatment pain thoracotomy could present limited number complication . However , consensus best technique realisation PVB . Para-vertebral catheterisation perform posterior approach seek strength loss bone contact transverse vertebral process use technique Eason Wyatt , blind technique . The ultrasonographic control , develop context puncture invasive action , effective contribution realisation BPV , still insufficiently validate . First use measure distance skin - posterior costo-transverse ligament skin - parietal pleura procedure , ultrasonography recently lead publication echo-guided technique combine recognition structure define space para- vertebral , view progression needle spread local anesthetic . The handle ultrasonographic probe associate puncture require additional learning . The objective project study feasibility para-vertebral catheter insertion ultrasonographic control . The appearance like `` pigtail '' catheter , recently propose , seem attractive term safety . The aim pilot prospective study accurately quantify qualitative parameter relate technique order achieve future validation medico-economic component . Ultrasound-guided technique correspond technique puncture lateral medial space describe Shibata , spot first rib propose Bouzinac . This study propose patient undergo thoracotomy total partial pulmonary resection Thoracic Surgery service Centre Jean Perrin , number patient require 60 patient period inclusion 12 month .</brief_summary>
