They , patient , treat four week LCD achieve decrease liver size . During period examine day 0 , 3 , 7 , 14 28 commence LCD . At evaluation , body composition assess bioelectric impedance analysis ( BIA ) , liver volume intrahepatic fat magnetic resonance imaging . A questionnaire regard quality life LCD-related symptom administer well . At surgery two sample subcutaneous fat one sample omental fat take . We assign patient different treatment , instead treat similarly accord routine preoperative regimen .</detailed_description>
