	<brief_summary>Bone graft widely use hospital repair injure , age diseased skeletal tissue . In Europe , one million patient encounter surgical bone reconstruction annually number increase due age population . Bone graft intend facilitate bone heal osteogenesis ( i.e . bone generation ) site damage , attain presently include cell capable form bone augmentation . Bone autograft safest effective grafting procedure , since contains patient 's bone grow cell ( enhance osteogenesis ) proteins ( enhance osteoinduction ) , provide scaffold new bone grow ( osteoconduction ) . However , bone autograft limit quantity ( 20 cc ) harvesting ( e.g . iliac crest ) represent additional surgical intervention , frequent consequent pain complication . We hypothesize use autologous bone marrow cell expand GMP facility surgically implant synthetic bone substitute contribute resolution health socioeconomic complication delay union non-union diaphyseal metaphyseal-diaphyseal fracture safety efficacy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Efficacy Safety Autologous MSCs Combined Biomaterials Enhance Bone Healing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Tissue engineering combine bone marrow cell mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) , synthetic scaffold molecular signal ( growth differentiate factor ) order form hybrid construct . For bone reconstruction purpose , human MSCs seed culture porous calcium phosphate ceramic osteogenic medium . Some clinical study low number patient report use approach outcome inconsistent low efficacy bone regeneration . The reason limit clinical success may due several bottleneck multidisciplinary field bone tissue engineering . The association vitro biomaterials osteoprogenitor cell raise technical challenge regulatory ethic issue implementation clinical trial , whereas expansion MSCs possible GMP Facility . The expected result obtain bone consolidation thus heal delay union non-union , proven image technique , without use bone graft . This prove efficacy propose IMP base pluripotent MSCs expand GMP facility mixed granulate biphasic calcium phosphate surgical setting implantation . No expected complication related procedure expect . Changes serum level bone turnover marker describe .</detailed_description>
