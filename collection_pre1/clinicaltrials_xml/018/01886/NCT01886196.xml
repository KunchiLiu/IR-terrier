	<brief_summary>Inflammation increase age implicated reduction bone mass , muscle mass , strength . Resistance training safe effective increase muscle mass strength old adult , however resistance training suppress inflammation . Ibuprofen non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug may provide benefit muscle mass strength give resistance training session older adult ; however , evidence require confirm effect across lifespan . The objective determine effect 9 month exercise train ibuprofen supplementation , compare placebo , old woman ( ≥65years ) follow dependent variable : - bone density , geometry , architecture - muscle mass strength - balance</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ibuprofen Supplementation After Resistance Training Its Effects Bone Older Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study create new evidence effectiveness safety non-steroid anti-inflammatory supplementation ( i.e . ibuprofen ) combine exercise influence positively bone muscle health woman age 65 year old . With age , significant decrease bone mineral , muscle mass , strength , increase risk fall , injury fracture especially woman . Direct indirect health cost associate osteoporosis sarcopenia ( define `` muscle wasting '' ) billion dollar escalate proportion old adult Canada grow . Low-grade inflammation main contribute factor bone muscle deterioration age mitigate anti-inflammatory drug use . Recent evidence show resistance exercise training combine non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug ( ibuprofen ) effective increase bone mineral density young woman . No study address directly effect ibuprofen use follow resistance exercise bone muscle old woman , population great risk develop osteoporosis . The primary purpose study investigate safety multiple effect ibuprofen ingestion follow supervise resistance exercise train bone muscle old woman ( ≥65y ) . PRIMARY HYPOTHESES : Ibuprofen combine resistance training maintain hip lumbar spine areal bone mineral density old woman . Secondary hypothesis bone structural property hip wrist , muscle mass strength improve supplementing ibuprofen resistance training session . RESEARCH PLAN : The study use repeat measure , parallel group randomize design 100 woman ( ≥65 ) randomize one 4 group : 1 ) Exercise ibuprofen ( 400 mg immediately exercise ) ; 2 ) Exercise ibuprofen placebo ; 3 ) Placebo exercise ibuprofen , 4 ) Placebo exercise ibuprofen placebo . Women participate exercise session 3 day per week . The intervention 9 month duration . Dual energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) use assess hip lumbar spine areal bone mineral density , well geometric change hip structure , whole body lean tissue ( i.e . muscle ) mass . Peripheral quantitative compute tomography ( pQCT ) high-resolution-pQCT allow u investigate detailed change bone microarchitecture wrist muscle cross-sectional area forearm response intervention . Safety address closely monitoring adverse event . RELEVANCE : This pilot study potentially drive novel post-market use ibuprofen . In addition , permit develop research team foray preliminary data collection inform large randomize control trial ( RCT ) application CIHR .</detailed_description>
