	<brief_summary>Herpes zoster ( commonly refer `` shingle '' ) result reactivation varicella-zoster virus acquire primary infection , usually chickenpox . The virus lay dormant cell nerve activate . Once activated , patient develop characteristic red blistering rash crust heal 2 - 4 week . Postherpetic neuralgia ( PHN ) , term pain persist herpes zoster ( HZ ) eruption heals , common fear complication herpes zoster infection . The drug , Civamide think desensitize nerve decrease pain PHN . This pharmacologic rationale use nose postherpetic neuralgia trigeminal nerve , nerve nose transmits pain face . The objective study evaluate safety efficacy intranasally administer Civamide ( 0.01 % ) treatment moderate severe daily pain associate postherpetic neuralgia trigeminal nerve . Neuropathic pain must persist ≥ 12 month .</brief_summary>
