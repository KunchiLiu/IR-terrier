	<brief_summary>Patient demographic ( age , height weight ) collect 546 consecutive patient present dental restoration general anesthesia . The baseline saturation record . The induction anesthesia standardize patient . All patient undergo inhalational induction administer face mask . After insert intravenous ( IV ) line , rocuronium administer . Intravenous propofol fentanyl could add discretion anesthesiologist . The patient mask ventilated mixture Air/Oxygen ( O2 ) achieve FiO2 0.3 3 minute administration rocuronium . Patients randomly assign one three group purpose airway management : 1 ) direct laryngoscopy nasotracheal intubation without oxygen insufflation ( DL group ) ; 2 ) direct laryngoscopy nasotracheal intubation oxygen insufflation ( DLO2 Group ) ; 3 ) nasotracheal intubation use Truview PCD video laryngoscope ( VL Group ) . Computer-generated treatment allocation ( use PLAN procedure SAS statistical software , use random-sized block ) maintain sequentially number sealed envelope open consent obtain . The laryngoscopy intubation perform study investigator faculty anesthesiologists mid-level resident fellow work . The study stop : - patient intubate CO2 trace obtain capnography - patient desaturates 90 % - patient show sign cardiac instability ( ectopic beat , arrhythmia hypotension ) Randomized group compare balance potentially confound baseline variable use descriptive statistic . Primary outcome : In primary hypothesis , desaturation characterize use time 1 % saturation drop baseline rate ( slope ) desaturation initial 1 % drop . We consider give intubation technique ( DLO2 VL ) good DL control saturation find noninferior ( i.e. , bad ) outcomes superior least one outcome . Thus primary hypothesis assess joint hypothesis test framework describe Mascha Turan . We a-priori define non-inferiority delta outcome time 1 % drop 5 second ( 1.05 use hazard ratio ) slope delta 0.05 percent per second .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Secondary outcome : Secondary-1 . We conduct test superiority compare Truview DL oxygen cannula method two primary outcome , report treatment effect estimate adjust confidence interval . Notably , study power able assess equivalence two oxygen technique . Secondary-2 . We compare three randomize group total desaturation slope ( rate ) use random slope linear mixed effect model repeat measure . This model allow account variability saturation rate patient possible correlation saturation measurement within patient ( autoregressive correlation ) . We use saturation data reach 90 % . Secondary-3 . We assess relative efficacy Truview DL oxygen cannula prevent 90 % saturation compare DL alone use 2-tailed chi-square test proportion ( superiority ) , summarize relative risk confidence interval . Secondary -4 : We assess correlation rate desaturation age body mass index , independent randomize group . This do context random slope model primary aim , assess interaction mean desaturation slope age body mass index . To restrict overall Type I error secondary hypothesis 5 % apply Bonferroni correction multiple inference adjustment interim analysis . Interim analyse conduct every 25 % maximum planned enrollment use group sequential design test efficacy futility . We use gamma spending function ( gamma = -4 efficacy -2 futility ) maintain significance level primary outcome 2.5 % power 90 % across interim analysis . Significance criterion test adjust interim analysis base above-mentioned gamma spending function correspond z-statistic teach interim look .</detailed_description>
