	<brief_title>Intravital Microscopy Identifying Tumor Vessels Patients With Stage IA-IV Melanoma That Being Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility perform intravital microscopy accessible human melanoma tumor standard course treatment ( i.e. , wide local excision ) . ( Part I ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine blood flow velocity tumor vessel tissue penetration fluorescein ( fluorescein sodium ) marker tumor vessel permeability . ( Part II ) OUTLINE : Patients receive fluorescein sodium intravenously ( IV ) follow intravital microscopic observation 10-15 minute excision melanoma . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 week periodically 5 year .</detailed_description>
