	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose lenalidomide give together ibrutinib treat patient chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma return period improvement respond treatment . Biological therapy , lenalidomide , may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Ibrutinib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving lenalidomide together ibrutinib may work well treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lenalidomide Ibrutinib Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To define safety , tolerability maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) lenalidomide use combination ibrutinib adult relapse refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) /small lymphocytic lymphoma ( SLL ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine response rate response duration relapse refractory CLL/SLL patient ibrutinib lenalidomide . II . To characterize plasma pharmacokinetic ( PK ) interaction ibrutinib lenalidomide . III . To explore whether pharmacogenetic study predict response , resistance toxicity ibrutinib lenalidomide . IV . To explore ability ibrutinib occupy target ( Bruton 's tyrosine kinase [ BTK ] B-cells interleukin-2 inducible kinase [ ITK ] T-cells ) , whether co-administration lenalidomide influence bind . V. To explore early late immunologic consequence combine ibrutinib lenalidomide relapse refractory CLL . VI . To explore impact ibrutinib lenalidomide ra homolog family member H ( RhoH ) expression whether baseline RhoH expression predict outcomes regimen . VII . To explore mechanism resistance ibrutinib . VIII . To explore influence traditional new CLL/SLL clinical laboratory prognostic factor response ibrutinib lenalidomide . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study lenalidomide . Patients receive run-up course ibrutinib orally ( PO ) daily day 1-28 . Patients receive ibrutinib PO lenalidomide PO daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After 12 course , patient achieve complete remission ( CR ) /CR incomplete marrow recovery ( CRi ) , nodular partial remission ( PR ) , partial remission stable disease discontinue lenalidomide continue ibrutinib . After completion study treatment , patient follow 90 day .</detailed_description>
