	<brief_summary>Background study : CRPS type-1 pain syndrome usually develop initiate noxious event ( e.g . fracture ) extremity . Although treatment option life dimethyl-sulphoxide ( DMSO ) , N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) intensive physical therapy exist , treatment effect often unsatisfactory , even lead amputation extremity . Surgical treatment chronic pain disorder divide sympathetic chain establish treatment . Its invasive nature prevent widespread application . After introduction minimal invasive technique recent year , UMCG devise truly minimal invasive , yet safe effective thoracoscopic technique , require single 1 cm long incision anterior axillary line . This technique develop treatment primary focal axillary palmar hyperhidrosis , perform 50 patient produce satisfying result . This fact lead hypothesis surgical technique offer group chronic pain patient safe , effective treatment modality . Objective study : The effect intervention pain regain function de affected extremity . This quantified multiple questionnaire baseline three follow-up point , clinical evaluation hand function baseline two follow-up point . Study design : Single center prospective feasibility study</brief_summary>
