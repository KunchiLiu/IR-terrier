	<brief_summary>We aim investigate adiponectin facilitate diagnosis ARF analyze adiponectin level acute convalescent period acute rheumatic fever compare result healthy control group ; also comparatively examine level adiponectin ARF case different clinical finding presentation . In addition , aim investigate role pathogenesis ARF evaluate correlation cytokine TNF-α , IL-6 IL-8 acute phase reactant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Totally , 33 child ( age range : 5 - 17 year ; 15 male 18 female ) enrol study diagnose ARF Pediatric Cardiology Department , Medical Faculty , Eskişehir Osmangazi University . The study protocol approve Ethics Committee Medical Faculty , Eskişehir Osmangazi University ( Decision No . 41 date June 4 , 2008 ) . Parents study participant informed aim method study write consent obtain . For study subject , diagnosis ARF make accord Modified Jones criterion ( 4 ) appropriate treatment start . Patients divide three group clinical finding . Group 1 include patient chorea , patient arthritis carditis involve Group 2 patient carditis include Group 3 . A group arthritis establish since patient isolated arthritis usually follow primary secondary healthcare facility rather refer patient tertiary healthcare center . Venous Blood Sampling Following test analyze use venous blood sample draw patient healthy control subject ; complete blood count , ESR , nephelometric CRP immune turbidimetric hsCRP , total cholesterol , triglyceride , LDL-C HDL-C level enzymatic coloxrimetric method FSH LH total testosterone ( male subject ) estradiol ( female subject ) level chemoluminescent assey . Plasma serum sample draw adiponectin , TNF-α , IL-6 IL-8 . Blood sample draw analyze acute phase reactant Day 2nd , 5th , 10th 15th day 8 week order evaluate response treatment , blood sample simultaneously draw analyze adiponectin , TNF-α , IL-6 IL-8 level . Plasma Adiponectin Measurement Venous blood sample add centrifuge tube EDTA , centrifuge 3000 rpm , 4 °C 15 minute resultant plasma sample store -80 °C . Plasma sample dilute ( 1:300 ) direct instruction use kit , analysis conduct . Samples take plasma adiponectin level analyze use Human Adiponectin ELISA , High Sensitivity kit ( BioVendor Research Diagnostic Products , Modrice , Czech Republic ) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay ( ELISA ) method . Absorbance read 450 nm . Results express ng/ml convert µg/ml via divide 1000 . Serum TNF-α , IL-6 IL-8 Measurements The venous blood sample add centrifuge tube contain anticoagulant measure serum TNF-α , IL-6 IL-8 level . Samples centrifuge 3000 rpm , 4 °C 15 minute resultant serum sample store -80 °C . Samples take measure serum TNF- , IL-6 IL-8 level analyze ELISA method use Human TNF-α ELISA , Human IL-6 ELISA , Human IL-8/NAP-1 ELISA kit ( Bender MedSystems , Vienna , Austria ) . Absorbance read 450 nm . Results express pg/ml .</detailed_description>
