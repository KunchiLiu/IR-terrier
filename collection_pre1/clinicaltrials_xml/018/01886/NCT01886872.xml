	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study rituximab bendamustine hydrochloride ibrutinib see well work compare ibrutinib alone treat old patient previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia . Monoclonal antibody , rituximab , may block cancer growth different way target certain cell . Drugs use chemotherapy , bendamustine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Ibrutinib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know whether rituximab bendamustine hydrochloride may work good rituximab ibrutinib ibrutinib alone treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Rituximab Bendamustine Hydrochloride , Rituximab Ibrutinib , Ibrutinib Alone Treating Older Patients With Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether progression free survival ( PFS ) superior therapy bendamustine ( bendamustine hydrochloride ) combination rituximab , ibrutinib alone , ibrutinib combination rituximab patient age 65 old previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine 2-year PFS three treatment arm . II . To determine treatment arm produce superior overall survival ( OS ) . III . To determine complete response ( CR ) rate , complete nodular partial response ( CR/nPR ) rate , overall response ( PR+nPR+CR ) rate ( ORR ) among three treatment arm compare arm . IV . To determine impact minimal residual disease ( MRD ) -negative disease time CR documentation 2 year PFS OS treatment arm . V. To determine duration response three treatment compare treatment arm . VI . To determine toxicity tolerability three treatment regimen . VII . To determine response PFS patient initially bendamustine combination rituximab arm cross ibrutinib . VIII . To determine whether baseline cytogenetic marker , zeta-chain ( TCR ) associate protein kinase 70kDa ( Zap-70 ) methylation , immunoglobulin variable region ( IgVH ) mutational status , select deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) mutation predict outcome time response three arm . IX . To determine whether local fluorescent situ hybridization ( FISH ) result del ( 11q22.3 ) del ( 17p13.1 ) consistent central analysis . X . To determine whether baseline micro ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) gene expression marker correlate clinical outcome interest ( e.g . progression-free alive 2 year versus ) , well explore change microRNA expression baseline post-treatment time point , focus persistent lymphocytosis relapse . XI . To determine whether eradication MRD predict long duration response standard therapy ibrutinib-based regimen . XII . To describe baseline functional status , comorbid medical condition , number medication older CLL patient meet criterion therapy . XIII . To determine functional status change therapy use baseline 3-month evaluation end-of-study/2-year evaluation ; determine whether change different among treatment group . XIV . To determine whether geriatric assessment variable know associated chemotherapy toxicity disease group also predict therapy-associated toxicity CLL population . XV . To assess whether Fc fragment IgG , low affinity IIIa , receptor ( CD16a ) ( FCGR3A ) polymorphism ( rs396991 ) correlate depth response ( MRD status ) ibrutinib plus rituximab 6 cycle , secondary endpoint CR rate , rapidity response , progression-free survival ( PFS ) . XVI . To assess whether complement component 1 , q subcomponent , A chain ( C1QA ) polymorphism ( rs172378 ) correlate MRD status , CR rate , rapidity response , PFS . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 3 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive rituximab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 ( day 0 course 1 ) bendamustine hydrochloride IV 30 minute day 1-2 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients experience disease progression may crossover Arm II . ARM II : Patients receive ibrutinib orally ( PO ) daily day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM III : Patients receive ibrutinib Arm II . Patients receive rituximab IV day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 course 2 day 1 course 3-6 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 6 month 10 year .</detailed_description>
