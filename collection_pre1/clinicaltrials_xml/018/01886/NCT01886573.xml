	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study azacitidine entinostat treat patient newly diagnose stage IA-IIIIA non-small cell lung undergo surgery . Drugs use chemotherapy , azacitidine , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell stop dividing . Entinostat may stop growth cancer tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving azacitidine entinostat may effective treatment non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Azacitidine Entinostat Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Stage IA-IIIA Non-Small Lung Cancer Undergoing Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To measure reversal aberrant genome-wide promoter methylation gene re-expression pair , pre- post- treatment lung tumor tissue pair patient newly diagnose , surgically resectable non-small cell lung cancer exposure single neoadjuvant cycle 5-azacytidine ( azacitidine ) entinostat . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To measure 3-year disease-free survival operable non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patient receive 1 cycle preoperative epigenetic treatment . II . To determine potential toxicity , reversibility toxicity , single pre-operative cycle 5-azacytidine entinostat . OUTLINE : Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1-6 8-10 entinostat orally ( PO ) day 3 10 . Patients undergo surgery day 11-20 ( period extend 10 day adverse event therapy impose surgical risk ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week , every 3 month 2 year every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
