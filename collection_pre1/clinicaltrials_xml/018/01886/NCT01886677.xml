PURPOSE : Randomized phase II trial study effectiveness weight loss , via healthy energy-restricted diet exercise , slow prevent disease progression patient newly diagnose prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Energy Balance Men With Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This 2-arm randomized control feasibility trial among 40 overweight obese men newly diagnose prostate cancer schedule prostatectomy . This study use presurgical period explore potential impact weight loss via healthy energy-restricted diet increase physical activity circulate hormone , cytokine , growth factor , well effect tumor biology clinical outcome . Consenting patient block randomize 1-of-2 study arm : 1 ) healthful diet + exercise intervention promote weight loss 2 pounds/week ; 2 ) wait-list control receive intervention study period complete . Both group receive nutritional counseling study period correct nutritional deficiency food source . This study explore contrast change body mass index ( BMI ) observe study period ( minimum 3.5 week ) intervention vs. wait-list control arm , also monitor change body composition , energy intake physical activity ; change study relation follow endpoint : ) change select circulate biomarkers gene expression relate cancer progression , hormonal status , inflammation energy-related factor ; b ) rate tumor proliferation apoptosis ; c ) tumor immunohistochemical marker insulin receptor , vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , AKT , nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer activate B cell ( NFkB ) ; ) functional health-related outcome , i.e. , side-effects medical outcome , quality life ( QoL ) , functional status .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Histopathologically confirm prostate cancer Elects prostatectomy first line treatment ( i.e. , androgen ablation , radiation therapy , etc ) Has least 3.5 week lagtime schedule prostatectomy ( must able participate diet exercise program full 3.5 week ) . Body mass index ( BMI ) 25 49.9 Mentally competent Able speak write English Has telephone access Agrees randomize either study arm ( immediate delay diet exercise program ) Another active malignancy ( include nonmelanoma skin cancer ) Medical condition affect weight ( e.g. , untreated thyroid disturbance Currently weight loss regimen Preexisting medical condition ( ) preclude adherence unsupervised exercise , e.g. , severe orthopedic condition , schedule hip knee replacement , bone metastasis , paralysis , dementia , untreated stage 3 hypertension , unstable angina , heart attack , congestive heart failure condition dictate hospitalization oxygen within 6mths , etc .</criteria>
