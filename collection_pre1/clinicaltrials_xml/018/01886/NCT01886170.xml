	<brief_summary>In two-phase mixed method study , investigator first use patient feedback semi-structured interview explore way patient diabetes understand diabetes assess disease control . The investigator also use interview elicit patient feedback promise alternative communication format hemoglobin A1C ( A1C ) . In second phase study , investigator test new format communicate information regard diabetes control patient poorly control diabetes . This phase three arm RCT compare effect A1C ( standard medical information ) versus two alternative format several participant outcome , primarily glycemic control 6 month post-intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Using Patient Feedback Improve Communication Regarding Glycemic Control Patients With Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The noted importance understand glycemic control concern give study estimate 25 % patient understand hemoglobin A1C value ( A1C ) . The A1C blood test value reflect average blood sugar previous 3 month use clinical indicator diabetes control guideline-set target communication format express level disease control patients.Past work demonstrate potential effectiveness translate poorly understood medical value , like A1C , universally understood form . We believe application use address problem poorly understood A1C . This study two-phase mixed method approach . We design alternative communication format convey information provide A1C patient evaluate effectiveness format improve glycemic control , increase patient understand diabetes control , alter patient behavior . In Phase I study , use patient feedback semi-structured interview 17-25 patient diabetes explore way patient assess gauge diabetes control , well elicit patient feedback promise communication format . Potential alternative communication format include category represent color-based scale ( red/yellow/green ) , comparison average norm , trajectory control time modify medical terminology ( i.e. , change name test ) . In phase II , patient poorly control diabetes randomize receive information glycemic control one three study arm , A1C ( control ) one two experimental format arm ( choose base phase I result ) effect different communication format evaluate .</detailed_description>
