	<brief_summary>The standard care woman high risk endometrial cancer removal visible lymph node pelvis low abdomen identify disease spread area . It estimate 25 % woman presume early stage high risk endometrial cancer positive lymph node however currently majority woman subject extensive resection pelvic lymph para-aortic lymph node associated morbidity . The objective study determine intraoperative sentinel lymph node ( SLN ) map improve assessment regional lymph node enhance detection lymph nod metastatic disease endometrial cancer . This would benefit majority woman early stage high risk endometrial cancer would prevent associated complication pelvic lymph node dissection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>If SLN accurately identify detection metastatic lymph node woman early stage high risk endometrial cancer improve majority woman could avoid complete systematic pelvic lymphadenectomy . Pelvic lymphadenectomy associate many intraoperative postoperative complication hemorrhage , lymphocyst formation , nerve injury chronic low extremity lymphedema . If less invasive technique assess regional lymph node involvement , SLN mapping , replace routine pelvic lymphadenectomy complication associate extensive pelvic surgery could avoid . This prospective cohort study . The population study patient newly diagnose early stage high risk endometrial cancer undergo primary surgical intervention include hysterectomy bilateral pelvic inframesenteric para-aortic lymphadenectomy via laparotomy , laparoscopy robotic-assisted . Patients take operate room plan procedure . After initiation general anesthesia , fluorescent dye ( indocyanine green , ICG ) inject patient 's cervix . The dye visualize excitation infrared light ( attachment Novadaq Pinpoint system laparoscopy ) . The surgery proceed lymph node `` green '' remove surgically anatomic location laterality document . These `` green '' sentinel node assess study pathologist frozen section result read intraoperatively . The hysterectomy complete lymphadenectomy perform . The SLN status compare status node remove complete lymphadenectomy . All data patient prospectively collect .</detailed_description>

Patients sign approve informed consent . Patients undergo surgery include abdominal hysterectomy bilateral pelvic inframesenteric paraaortic lymphadenectomy via laparotomy , laparoscopy roboticassisted .
