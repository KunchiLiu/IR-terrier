	<brief_title>Treatment Trigger Finger With Steroid Injection Versus Steroid Injection Splinting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stenosing tenosynovitis , commonly `` trigger finger '' disease severely impact patient 's quality life . Its incidence say 28 person per 100,000 annually . The disease manifest one finger finger lock flexion extension , lead pain , discomfort time , loss function . Patients frequently report snap finger back position alleviate symptom . The pathophysiology relate thicken flexor tendon sheath , impair tendon glide within . Although multiple treatment strategy available , entirely clear treatment offer best outcome , especially finger reached end stage lock . In general , corticosteroid injection tendon sheath offer first line treatment . Splinting alone also describe reliable method treatment . However , Patel Bassini indicate steroid injection result few recurrence splint alone . Surgery typically reserve recurrent triggering , case refractory injection , digits lock flexion . The effect steroid injection follow splint however report comprehensive fashion . It may form treatment could result synergistic effect , offer treatment modality superior either injection splint alone . The purpose research study determine whether steroid injection follow splint superior injection alone .</detailed_description>
