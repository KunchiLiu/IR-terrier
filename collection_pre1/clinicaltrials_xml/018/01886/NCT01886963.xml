	<brief_summary>The purpose project assess efficacy Spy Elite System ( LifeCell Corporation , Branchburg , NJ , USA ) plan tissue advancement flap reduce wound complication complex ventral hernia repair . Complex ventral hernia repair associate high rate wound complication . To large degree complication cause create tissue advancement flap close abdomen , compromise blood supply skin subcutaneous tissue . The current standard care assessment blood perfusion flap surgeon 's clinical judgment . It , however , often inaccurate . The Spy Elite System develop address problem . The Spy Elite System device enables surgeon visualize evaluate tissue perfusion real time . It help surgeon identify optimal flap design reduce risk postoperative wound complication related tissue ischemia . The primary goal study evaluate efficacy Spy Elite System aid surgeon create tissue flap adequate blood supply prospective , randomized clinical trial . The Spy Elite System use successfully assess viability mastectomy flap breast surgery show extremely sensitive predict mastectomy flap necrosis . However , clinical trial conduct order evaluate efficacy Spy Elite System assess viability abdominal subcutaneous flap complex ventral hernia repair .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Using Spy Elite System Planning Tissue Advancement Flaps After Ventral Hernia Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More 90,000 ventral hernia repair perform US annually . Large ventral hernia often require complex abdominal wall reconstruction include create tissue advancement flap . Complex abdominal wall reconstruction associate 20 % rate wound complication include skin flap necrosis wound breakdown . Prevention skin necrosis ischemia would significantly reduce morbidity associate procedure .</detailed_description>
