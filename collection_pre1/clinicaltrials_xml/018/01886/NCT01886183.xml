	<detailed_description>The objective work compare effect two balance training program , one Nintendo Wii Fit-based traditionally-based without use gaming system , motor function , cognition , balance gait chronic stroke patient . It prospective , single blind , randomize clinical trial perform Center Research course Speech Therapy , Physical Therapy Occupational Therapy São Paulo University . Forty chronic stroke patient randomly control experimental group , 20 one . Both group conduct 14 training session , twice week , seven week . Each session consist 30 minute-global-exercise series include stretch , muscle strength axial mobility exercise . After , group perform 30 minute balance training : control group perform balance exercise without external cue , visual auditory feedback cognitive stimulation ; experimental group perform balance training 10 Wii Fit game stimulate motor cognitive function . The main outcome measure : ( 1 ) low limb subscale Fugl-Meyer Assessment ( FMA-LE ) ; ( 2 ) Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) ( 3 ) ; Balance Evaluation Systems Test ( BESTest ) ( 4 ) 6- minute walk test ( 6MWT ) .</detailed_description>
