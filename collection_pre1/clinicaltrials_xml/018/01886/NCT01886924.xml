	<detailed_description>Cigarette smoke lead cause morbidity mortality among people live HIV ( PLWH ) engage highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) [ 2-5 ] . Between 40-70 % PLWH U.S. currently smoke [ 6-14 ] , comparison 20.6 % general population [ 15 ] , tobacco account nearly 25 % deaths multinational cohort PLWH use HAART [ 2 ] . PLWH smoke uniquely vulnerable , moreso smoker without HIV , develop cardiovascular [ 2 , 16 ] lung [ 2 , 17 ] disease , also great risk non-smoking PLWH multitude HIV-associated illnesses [ 3 , 5 , 18 , 19 ] . Against backdrop , HIV treatment provider acknowledge importance assist PLWH smoke cessation , significant proportion lack confidence , training , and/or time [ 10 , 12 , 20 ] . Very little research smoke cessation intervention PLWH publish , none evaluate approach could easily disseminate integrated standard HIV care . In context , sophisticated , efficacious [ ORs , 1.4-1.6 meta-analyses [ 21 , 22 ] ] tobacco quitline network available every U.S. state via national quitline portal , 1-800-QUIT-NOW represent untapped resource PLWH . Notably , positive finding , date , smoke cessation PLWH involve telephone counseling deliver clinical research staff [ 1 ] , exist study report efficacy engage PLWH tobacco quitlines brief motivational approach facilitate process . The long-term goal research program disseminate effective , brief computer-based intervention readily integrated community-based , HIV treatment setting motivate tobacco quitline use among smoker live HIV . The overall objective application , first step attainment long-term goal , develop computer-based intervention , modify base initial pilot feedback insure feasibility acceptability , obtain preliminary data support efficacy intervention . The rationale propose research many smoker live HIV interested quit smoking , explore smoking-related concern , provide feedback enhance self-efficacy , become motivated engage smoke cessation counseling , utilize no-cost , readily available treatment option-their local tobacco quitline . We plan accomplish objective application pursue follow three specific aim : 1 . To develop brief , computer-based intervention , CI-METQ - Computer Intervention Motivate Engagement Tobacco Quitline treatment PLWH smoke . Also , develop computer-based , time match nutrition education PLWH control intervention ( NC ) . 1a . Following development prototype , conduct preliminary pilot test CI-METQ 8 smoker live HIV , follow in-depth interview individual develop understanding strength limitation intervention . We utilize interview feedback guide modification refinement CI-METQ , repeat process another 8 smoker live HIV . 1b . The data collect 16 interview regard feasibility , acceptability barrier would limit effectiveness guide investigator make appropriate modification finalize CI-METQ prior preliminary test small , randomize control trial ( RCT ) . 1c . A similar iterative process occur 4 PLWH smoke develop NC condition . 2 . To conduct preliminary RCT 100 smoker live HIV , compare CI-METQ computer-based , time match nutrition control ( NC ) equate offer tobacco quitline referral engage quitline , 8 week nicotine patch cost . We expect : 2a . CI-METQ relative NC result increase readiness smoke cessation post-intervention high rate engagement smoke cessation treatment . 2b . CI-METQ relative NC result great proportion participant make least one 24 hour quit attempt six month post-intervention high rate 7-day point prevalence abstinence 1- , 3- 6- month follow-up . 2c . To examine effect CI-METQ vs. NC health-related quality life 6-month follow-up . 3 . To explore potential mechanism may underlie efficacy CI-METQ : 3a . We examine CI-METQ 's effect key mechanism self-reported computer session : concern cigarette smoking , likelihood reduce quit smoking , health benefit quit , satisfaction brief intervention content . 3b . We examine association dynamic change smoke cessation treatment engagement smoke outcome 1- , 3- 6-month follow-up . With regard expect outcome , work propose aim 1 - 3 expect result development brief , computer-based intervention produce preliminary data show increased tobacco quitline utilization smoke cessation smoker live HIV . Such result expect important positive impact , move u closer long-term goal dissemination integration cost-effective , CI-METQ community-based , HIV treatment setting , motivate tobacco quitline use PLWH smoke .</detailed_description>
