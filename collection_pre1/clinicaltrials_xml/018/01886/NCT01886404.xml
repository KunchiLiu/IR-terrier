	<brief_title>EFV Pharmacokinetics &amp; Pharmacogenomics Older HIV-infected Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Centers Disease Control estimate 15 % newly diagnose case HIV infection among people 50 year age older . By 2015 , one-half HIV-infected individual United States age &gt; 50 year , new case greatly increase lifespan due antiretroviral treatment ( High 2012 ) . Assessments antiretroviral pharmacokinetics old HIV-infected patient , specific dose guideline old patient contrast general geriatric population ( Hanlon 2009 ) . Studies old population demonstrate decrement liver metabolism renal clearance , may require dosage adjustment drug eliminate kidney . Additionally , decreased bioavailability due change drug transporter alter pharmacokinetics many drug older population ( Crawford 2010 , Hilmer 2007 ) . In relevant study old HIV-infected patient , trough lopinavir concentration 44 subject show high level associate old age ( Crawford 2010 ) . The author conclude decreased lopinavir clearance likely reason high trough lopinavir concentration old patient . In study 51 patient receive darunavir , univariate analysis determine every 10 year age lower clearance ( CL/F ) darunavir 19 % ( Dickinson 2011 ) . Importantly , efavirenz carefully evaluate old patient , even though one commonly prescribed agent , recommend combination drug prefer regimen Department Health Human Services ( DHHS ) World Health Organization WHO ( WHO 2010 , DHHS 2012 ) . Central nervous system side effect associate efavirenz common , reason recommend drug take bedtime ( Sustiva package insert ) . Neuropsychological performance symptom associate efavirenz carefully evaluate AIDS Clinical Trials Group ( ACTG ) study 5097s ( Clifford 2009 ) . We plan use similar assessment propose study , allow comparison historical control . The assessment include questionnaire assessment sleep , depression , anxiety . We also administer short battery neuropsychological test show sensitive HIV-related neurocognitive impairment . Pharmacogenetics may also play important role antiretroviral pharmacokinetics old population . Several polymorphism show associated adverse effect nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI ) ( Tozzi 2010 ) . The strong association abacavir hypersensitivity reaction Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) type B*5701 excellent example change clinical practice ( Mallal 2002 ) . Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) hepatotoxicity also appear associated Multi Drug Resistance 1 ( MDR1 ) gene polymorphism 3435 CT genotype confers reduce risk ( Haas 2006 ) . Efavirenz primarily hepatically metabolize . Clearance efavirenz occur predominantly via Cytochrome 2B6 ( CYP2B6 ) 8-hydroxy-efavirenz ( 8-OH-Efavirenz ) ; additionally subsequent pathway via cytochrome CYP2A6 a7-OH-Efavirenz metabolite ( Avery 2012 , di Iulio 2009 , Markwalder 2001 ) .CYP2B6 polymorphism observed inpatient increase frequency efavirenz-related side effect , associate drug discontinuation ( Haas 2004 , Ribaudo 2006 ) . In addition CYP2B6 , early treatment discontinuation efavirenz also recently associate polymorphism constitutive androstane receptor ( Wyen 2011 ) . Within study correlate efavirenz plasma metabolite concentration pharmacogenetic data CYP2B6 CYP2A6 status order define role metabolize enzyme efavirenz concentration old HIV-infected individual . Our goal ass whether CYP2B6 CYP2A6 status exacerbate efavirenz-related side effect age population .</detailed_description>
