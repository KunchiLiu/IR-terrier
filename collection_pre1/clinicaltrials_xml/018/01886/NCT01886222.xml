	<brief_summary>This study prospective multi-centre randomize trial compare effect long-term mild hypothermia versus routine normothermic intensive management patient severe traumatic brain injury . The primary hypothesis induction mild hypothermia ( maintain 34-35℃ ) 5 day improve outcome patient six month post injury compare normothermia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial Long-term Mild Hypothermia Severe Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Traumatic brain injury ( TBI ) remain leading cause death disability people injury constitute major public health concern develop develop country . There multiple clinical trial hypothermia therapy TBI conduct , however , conflict result . Subgroup analysis meta-analysis show therapeutic effect significant hypothermia maintain 48 hour . We previously report multicenter trial mild hypothermia ( 33-35℃ ) severe traumatic brain injury , 215 patient randomize long-term mild hypothermia group ( n = 108 ) 5 ±1.3 day mild hypothermia therapy short-term mild hypothermia group ( n = 107 ) 2±0.6 day mild hypothermia therapy . The result show improved outcome patient long-term mild hypothermia similar frequency complication . Therefore conclude long-term hypothermia , maintain 33-35℃ 5 day , could consider management severe traumatic brain injury . Hypothermia therapy recommend level III evidence 2007 Brain Trauma Foundation 's guideline treatment currently use department large neurosurgical center across China , aim decrease high intracranial pressure ( ICP ) improve functional outcome TBI patient . When decision make , injured patient would place cool blanket , tracheotomized ventilate . The patient would receive continuous infusion paralytic drug ( Tracrium 10-40 mg/hour ) chlorpromazine ( 5-10 mg/hour ) administer use infusion pump prevent shivering . The dosage give accord patient 's temperature , blood pressure , heart rate , muscular tone . Once patient 's rectal temperature reach 33˚C , keep approximately temperature ( 33-35˚C ) 5 7 day . Then patient passively rewarmed temperature 37 38˚C rate great 1˚C/hour , gradual adjustment blanket thermostat . The present multi-center , randomize controlled trial design investigate efficacy safety long-term ( 5 day ) mild hypothermia versus normothermia outcome patient follow severe traumatic brain injury . The primary outcome neurological function assess 1 , 6 month post injury Glasgow Outcome Score ( GOS ) . Additionally , follow data also record compare : baseline data , Glasgow Coma Score , image examination ( e.g . CT scan ) , need surgery , intracranial pressure , laboratory test ( e.g . blood routine test , liver kidney function , blood gas analysis , etc ) , complication ( e.g . pneumonia , significant bleeding ) .</detailed_description>
