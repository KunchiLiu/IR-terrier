	<brief_title>Atorvastatin Versus Rosuvastatin Contrast Induced Acute Kidney Injury ( PRATO-ACS 2 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , single-centre , randomized study , design compare nephro-protective effect high-dose atorvastatin high-dose rosuvastatin incidence Contrast Induced-Acute Kidney Injury ( CI-AKI ) . Consecutive statin-naïve patient admit investigator institution non-ST elevation Acute Coronary Syndrome ( NSTE-ACS ) schedule early invasive strategy eligible . Patients randomize two group : 1 ) high-dose rosuvastatin ( 40 mg on-admission follow 20 mg/day ) ; 2 ) high-dose atorvastatin ( 80 mg on-admission follow 40 mg/day ) . Randomization perform on-admission computerized open-label assignment blind envelope use consecutive fashion . All patient receive standard pre-procedural hydration . The primary end-point proportion patient increase serum creatinine ≥ 0.5 mg/dl ≥ 25 % baseline within 72 hour contrast medium administration . The secondary end-points persistent worsen renal damage ( eGFR reduction &gt; = 25 % 30 day ) cumulative adverse clinical event follow-up . Specifically : death , myocardial infarction , dialysis , stroke persistent renal damage 30 day ; death myocardial infarction 6 12 month .</detailed_description>
