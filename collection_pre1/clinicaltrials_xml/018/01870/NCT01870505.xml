	<brief_summary>The purpose study test safety drug call BYL719 different dose level . The investigator want find effect , good and/or bad , BYL719 patient breast cancer . BYL719 give either letrozole exemestane patient HR+ locally-advanced metastatic breast cancer . When recommended phase II dose BYL719 combination letrozole exemestane determine dose-finding phase , additional 10 patient enrol onto arm expansion phase study . The purpose expansion phase define safety feasibility BYL719 combination letrozole exemestane recommend phase II dose , estimate efficacy .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Women age ≥ 18 year Willing able comply schedule visit , treatment plan laboratory test Willing able consent biopsy locallyadvanced metastatic breast cancer prior treatment Metastatic locallyadvanced unresectable breast cancer ( include metastatic locallyadvanced unresectable breast cancer diagnose adjuvant letrozole exemestane ) Histologically document HR+ breast cancer either primary metastatic setting , define ER PR ≥ 1 % ; result local lab acceptable . Eligibility affect HER2 status . The recent treatment prior enrollment must one following ( duration treatment ≥2 week ) , must adequately tolerate accord treat physician 's judgment : Letrozole Exemestane Exemestane + everolimus ( everolimus must discontinue ≥ 3 week prior start study treatment ) Letrozole exemestane combination experimental agent ( ) clinical trial , provide experimental agent ( ) PI3K inhibitor AKT inhibitor ( experimental agent ( ) must discontinue ≥ 3 week prior start study treatment ) Any number prior endocrine therapy ( include tamoxifen , fulvestrant and/or aromatase inhibitor either adjuvant metastatic setting ) number prior chemotherapy regimen . Anticancer systemic therapy , chemotherapy biologics endocrine therapy , AI , must discontinue ≥ 3 week prior start study treatment . For dosefinding phase , patient must also stable disease OR progression disease recent treatment . For expansion phase , patient must progression disease recent treatment . Progression disease define new worsen disease objective imaging . Progression disease include recurrence diagnose adjuvant letrozole exemestane . Postmenopausal woman , define one following ( estradiol assay cutoff take account patient aromatase inhibitor therapy ) : Age ≥ 55 year one year amenorrhea Age &lt; 55 year one year amenorrhea , estradiol assay within postmenopausal range Age &lt; 55 year prior hysterectomy intact ovary , estradiol assay within postmenopausal range Surgical menopause bilateral oophorectomy Ovarian suppression LHRH agonist , estradiol assay within postmenopausal range baseline periodically onstudy Measurable nonmeasurable disease per RECIST criterion v1.1 ECOG performance status 01 Adequate organ function , define follow : Hematologic parameter : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500/μl ( without growth factor support ) Platelets ≥ 100,000/μl ( transfusion allow within 2 week ) Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dl ( may reach transfusion ) Liver function : Serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) unless attributable Gilbert 's syndrome AST ≤ 2.5 x ULN , ≤ 5 x ULN liver metastases present ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN , ≤ 5 x ULN liver metastases present Kidney function : Creatinine ≤ 1.5 ULN Endocrine function : Fasting plasma glucose &lt; 140 mg/dl ( may antiglycemic agent insulin ) . Fasting glucose measurement must obtain least 8 hour recent caloric intake . Ability swallow oral medication Willing discontinue herbal preparation / medication least 7 day prior first dose study drug throughout study . These include , limited , St . John 's wort , Kava , ephedra ( huang ) , gingko biloba , dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) , yohimbe , saw palmetto , ginseng . Pregnant patient woman breastfeed ( patient must postmenopausal , see Section 6.1.9 ) Patients central nervous system ( CNS ) involvement may participate : Clinically stable respect CNS tumor time screen &gt; 4 week prior therapy completion ( include radiation and/or surgery ) start study treatment Not receive steroid therapy Not receive enzyme induce antiepileptic medication start brain metastasis ( include carbamazepine , phenytoin , phenobarbital , primidone , oxcarbazepine , topiramate , vigabatrin ) Prior PI3K inhibitor AKT inhibitor ( patient previously treat everolimus eligible , see rationale Section 3.6 ) History toxicity recent AI ( letrozole exemestane ) warrant cessation AI Patients receive radiotherapy ≤ 2 week prior start study treatment Patients undergone major surgery ≤ 4 week prior start study treatment , recover side effect procedure Uncontrolled diabetes ( define fast glucose ≥ 140mg/dL ) and/or insulindependent diabetes . Fasting glucose measurement must obtain least 8 hour recent caloric intake . Patients currently require use antiglycemic agent ( insulin ) may enrol fast glucose &lt; 140mg/dL . Current need chronic corticosteroid therapy ( ≥10mg prednisone daily equivalent dose corticosteroid ) , patient receive systemic corticosteroid ≤ 2 week prior start study drug Current therapeutic anticoagulation warfarin ( coumarin derivative ) Active infection serious underlie medical condition would impair patient 's ability receive protocol treatment Clinically significant cardiac disease impair cardiac function , : Congestive heart failure require treatment ( e.g. , New York Heart Association Class II , III IV ) Acute coronary syndrome &lt; 3 month prior screen ( include myocardial infarction , unstable angina , coronary artery bypass graft , coronary angioplasty , stenting ) Uncontrolled arterial hypertension define blood pressure &gt; 140/100 mm Hg rest ( average 3 consecutive reading ) History current evidence unstable , clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia patient require medication narrow therapeutic window , atrial fibrillation and/or conduction abnormality , e.g . congenital long QT syndrome , highGrade/complete AVblockage Corrected QT interval ( QTc ) &gt; 480 msec screen ECG Patients currently receive medication know risk prolong QT interval induce Torsades de Pointes ( TdP ) treatment either discontinue switched different medication prior start study drug treatment ( see Section 9.6.3 Appendix F ) Impaired gastrointestinal function poorly control gastrointestinal disease may significantly alter absorption oral BYL719 ( e.g . Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis , malabsorption syndrome , small bowel resection , uncontrolled nausea vomiting , grade ≥ 3 diarrhea etiology ) base treat physician assessment Patients may `` currently active '' second malignancy nonmelanoma skin cancer . Patients consider `` currently active '' malignancy complete therapy consider physician less 30 % risk relapse .</criteria>
