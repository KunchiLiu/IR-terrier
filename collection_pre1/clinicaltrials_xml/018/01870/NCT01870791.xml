	<brief_summary>The prognosis patient advance oesophago-gastric cancer poor . Approximately 16,000 patient United Kingdom die disease . In spite new chemotherapy regimen , average survival patient around 9 month diagnosis . Omegaven infusion comprise omega-3 fish oil . There evidence omega-3 fish oil supplementation improve general well-being quality life patient receive palliative chemotherapy number different cancer type . It also suggest omega-3 fish oil supplementation may reduce toxicity chemotherapy . This clinical trial aim see whether addition Omegaven EOX chemotherapy , widely use regimen patient advance oesophago-gastric cancer , make drug regimen effective kill oesophago-gastric cancer cell , disease progression delay . Forty-five patient diagnose advanced oesophago-gastric cancer recruit two year period receive standard chemotherapy omega-3 fish oil supplementation . The result 45 patient compare matched historical control group patient receive identical chemotherapy . If result suggest combination EOX Omegaven sufficiently effective , tolerable feasible intention trial team take combination forward treat patient advance oesophago-gastric cancer randomise study .</brief_summary>
