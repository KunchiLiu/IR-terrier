	<detailed_description>Gastroenteritis remain one common cause morbidity mortality child &lt; 5 year age worldwide . A critical factor reduction mortality past 30 year introduction oral rehydration therapy ( ORT ) treatment dehydration . However , use stagnate many low- middle-income country ( LMIC ) many child lack access alternative intravenous ( IV ) rehydration . When child fluid loss replace orally due intractable vomiting , death common . Finding safe , non-invasive , effective strategy reduce vomit child would substantially decrease need IV rehydration hence morbidity mortality LMICs . Although antiemetic agent include WHO list Essential Medicines , use child gastroenteritis endorse World Health Organization ( WHO ) . Concerns include lack evidence antiemetic agent improve outcomes associate dangerous side effect . However , high-income setting , study ondansetron , antiemetic agent , demonstrate reduce vomiting , IV rehydration , hospitalization . Recent reviews prominent organization ( e.g . International child Health Review Collaboration ; Committee Selection Use Essential Medicines ) indicate interest ondansetron use child gastroenteritis , conclude evidence require . This trial aim determine administration single dose oral ondansetron result improve outcomes child bring emergency department care vomit diarrhea Pakistan . Two trial conduct umbrella one study . The propose trial identical exception severity dehydration enrollment ( either `` '' none `` well '' ) . The trial follow specific aim : 1 . To determine , child 6 - 59 month age AGE vomit diarrhea `` NO '' dehydration , reduction proportion child administer IV rehydration receive oral ondansetron addition WHO standard care , compare receive oral placebo addition WHO standard care . 2 . To determine , child 6 - 59 month age AGE vomit diarrhea `` SOME '' dehydration , reduction proportion child administer IV rehydration receive oral ondansetron addition WHO standard care , compare receive oral placebo addition WHO standard care . IV rehydration powerful marker treatment failure reduce need IV rehydration therapy either 2 group child view significant advance healthcare provider decision maker . Previous study ondansetron conduct low middle income country ( LMIC ) , relatively small sample size , employ WHO dehydration scale , focus young child ( i.e . &lt; 5 year ) . As therapy unavailable large number child LMIC country , ability demonstrate ondansetron reduce use IV rehydration provide compel evidence drug potential save live around world . We postulate oral ondansetron administration child LMIC , beneficial study population , could serve feasible reliable intervention available provision non-hospital base , outreach , healthcare provider remote region world . This study may immediate impact patient management . Based result , discover oral ondansetron play role reduce need intravenous rehydration child gastroenteritis Pakistan . As ondansetron available generic formulation , relatively inexpensive , anticipated study positive , ondansetron consider inclusion WHO - gastroenteritis care package . This could ultimately lead decrease need intravenous rehydration child country Pakistan .</detailed_description>
