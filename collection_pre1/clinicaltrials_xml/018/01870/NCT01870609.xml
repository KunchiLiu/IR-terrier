	<brief_summary>This study Phase 2 , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , multicenter study defactinib ( VS-6063 ) subject malignant pleural mesothelioma ( MPM ) progress ( confirm partial response stable disease ) follow ≥ 4 cycle treatment pemetrexed/cisplatin pemetrexed/carboplatin . Prior entry randomization study , subject must tumor Merlin status ( high low ) establish immunohistochemistry perform central laboratory . Subjects randomize 1:1 ratio receive oral VS-6063 400 mg twice per day , match placebo . Randomization stratify tumor Merlin status ( high versus low ) . Progression assess locally central review use Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ( RECIST ) Version 1.1 . Subjects continue receive treatment disease progression discontinuation criterion meet . Following documentation nonfatal disease progression , subject follow overall survival telephone contact every 2 month end life close study .</brief_summary>
