	<brief_summary>Glutathione important antioxidant protein protect cell harmful oxidative stress . Elderly human know elevated oxidative stress deficiency glutathione , know whether deficient synthesis glutathione muscle tissue elderly human . Mitochondria engines cell food consume burn make energy . Under normal condition fuel choice fast state fat , fast elderly human able oxidize fat well healthy young human . Elderly human also high incidence prevalence overweight obese , increased storage fat liver muscle . This study help determine whether 1. elderly human diminish synthesis glutathione skeletal muscle , whether improve supplement cysteine glycine ( isonitrogenous placebo ) diet ; 2. improve muscle glutathione concentration also improve fuel oxidation age ; 3. improvement intracellular glutathione concentration associate change total body fat content</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subjects recruit write informed consent form approve Institutional Review Board Baylor College Medicine time approval full protocol . Subjects take nonvitamin supplement lipid lower medication stop 4 week screen labs entire duration study . Fasted subject screen lab ( blood count , HbA1c , lipid profile , liver profile , blood urea nitrogen , Creatinine , thyroid stimulate hormone , free t4 , cortisol ) follow oral glucose tolerance test , measure muscle strength dynamometry , test function ( include 6-min walk test ) body composition scan measure total body fat . On another occasion , fast subject undergo stable isotope infusion study metabolic research unit measure concentrations amino-acids glutathione red blood cell muscle tissue , glutathione synthesis rate muscle red cell , plasma whole-body mitochondrial fatty-acid oxidation , Kreb 's cycle function , urine urea nitrogen , plasma reactive oxygen specie F2-isoprostanes , gene glutathione synthesis fuel oxidation . Elderly subject also magnetic resonance spectroscopy scan liver muscle fat content . Young subject give dietary cysteine glycine 2-weeks restudied 2-weeks later . They release study . Elderly subject study 16 week . They assign receive either cysteine plus glycine , alanine randomize , double-blinded study design . The study describe repeated 2 week 16 week . Subjects monthly measure liver profile , lipid profile , BUN creatinine glutathione .</detailed_description>
