	<brief_summary>The primary objective study evaluate safety single treatment hMaxi-K compare placebo ( PBS-20 % sucrose ) administer direct bladder wall injection . Two dose level ( 16000 µg 24000 µg -20 30 bladder wall injection , respectively ) female moderate OAB/DO ≥ six month duration evaluate . In dose level , 6 participant receive hMaxi-K 3 receive placebo . . In addition secondary efficacy parameter evaluate ( change baseline compare placebo ) , include number micturition per day , volume micturition , incontinence episode , pad weight , uninhibited contraction cystoscopy , quality life assessment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 1 Study Subjects With OAB Assessing Safety Activity hMaxi-K Gene Transfer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1 double blind , placebo control study assess safety activity 2 escalating dos hMaxi-K gene transfer direct injection bladder wall female subject OAB ( Overactive Bladder Syndrome Detrusor Overactivity ) . There total 9 visit 1 3 day post dose telephone contact patient evaluate new complaint . Following screen visit ( V1 V1A ) study drug administration week 0 , eligible participant evaluate safety post dose study drug week 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 . At Screening , Baseline ( prior dosing ) 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , 12 24 week post dose participant complete physical exam include urogenital examination . ECG perform Screening , Baseline , one week post dose final visit . At Screening , Baseline ( prior dosing ) 1 , 2 , 4 , 12 24 week post dosing , laboratory evaluation include chemistry , hematology , urinalysis perform . Urine culture do throughout study ( include prior catheterization discharge ) insure absence infection . Participants assess study drug effect incontinence Baseline ( prior dose ) week 4 24 post dosing cystometry . At Screening ( V1 ) 2 , 8 24 week post dose participant bladder scan evaluate residual volume . Subjects complete daily diary home 7 day prior baseline ( V2 ) . Diaries capture number micturition , volume micturition , number urge incontinence episode , rating episode , number pad use every 24 hour . The participant continue complete daily diary course trial diary evaluate follow-up visit . The participant evaluate perception bladder condition , QoL use Kings Health Questionnaire ( KHQ ) SF-12 . International Consultation Incontinence Questionnaire - Short Form ( ICIQ-SF ) complete throughout study .</detailed_description>
