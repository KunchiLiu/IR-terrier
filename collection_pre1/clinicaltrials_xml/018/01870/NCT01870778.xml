	<brief_title>Efficacy , Safety Tolerability Serelaxin When Added Standard Therapy AHF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase IIIb outcome study AHF patient design multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , event-driven study order ass efficacy , safety tolerability intravenous infusion serelaxin placebo . The AHF patient randomize either serelaxin placebo study follow period 180 day , require receive standard-of-care background HF management index hospitalization post discharge accord regional local guidelines/institutional standard .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Key Male female 18 year age , body weight ≤160 kg Hospitalized AHF anticipate requirment IV therapy least 48 hour ; AHF define include follow measured time presentation ( include emergency department ) end screening : Persistent dyspnea rest minimal exertion Pulmonary congestion chest radiograph BNP ≥500 pg/mL NTproBNP ≥2000 pg/mL ; patient ≥ 75 year age current atrial fibrillation ( time randomization ) , BNP ≥ 750 pg/mL NTproBNP ≥ 3,000 pg/mL Systolic BP ≥125 mmHg start end screen Able randomize within 16 hour presentation hospital , include emergency department Received intravenous furosemide least 40 mg total ( equivalent ) time presentation ( include outpatient clinic , ambulance , hospital include emergency department ) start screen study treatment current acute HF episode . Key Dyspnea primarily due noncardiac cause Known history respiratory disorder require daily use IV oral steroid ( include inhale steroid ) ; need intubation current use IV oral steroid COPD Temperature &gt; 38.5°C ( oral equivalent ) sepsis active infection require IV antimicrobial treatment Clinical evidence acute coronary syndrome currently within 30 day prior enrollment . AHF due significant arrhythmia , include follow : sustain ventricular tachycardia , bradycardia sustain ventricular rate &lt; 45 beat per minute , atrial fibrillation/flutter sustain ventricular response &gt; 130 beat per minute Patients severe renal impairment define prerandomization eGFR &lt; 25 mL/min/1.73m2 calculate use sMDRD equation , and/or receive current plan dialysis ultrafiltration Patients hematocrit &lt; 25 % , history blood transfusion within 14 day prior screen , active lifethreatening GI bleeding . Known hepatic impairment ( evidenced total bilirubin &gt; 3 mg/dL , increase ammonia level , perform ) history cirrhosis evidence portal hypertension varix . Significant , uncorrected , leave ventricular outflow obstruction , obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy severe aortic stenosis ( i.e. , aortic valve area &lt; 1.0 cm2 mean gradient &gt; 40 mmHg prior current echocardiogram ) , severe mitral stenosis Severe aortic insufficiency severe mitral regurgitation surgical percutaneous intervention indicate . Documented , prior time randomization , restrictive amyloid myocardiopathy , OR acute myocarditis hypertrophic obstructive , restrictive , constrictive cardiomyopathy ( NOT include restrictive mitral filling pattern see Doppler echocardiographic assessment diastolic function ) .</criteria>
