	<brief_title>Comparison Surgical Skin Preps During Cesarean Deliveries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently skin preparation solution currently use cesarean delivery chlorhexidine-alcohol base solution iodine povidone solution There recommendation surgical skin prep wound best utilized cesarean delivery , especially patient risk factor surgical site infection . Chlorhexidine solution report take minimal 2 minute application decrease bacterial load , continue decrease bacteria load 1 hour . Iodine povidone solution report completely effective within 4 minute application . Patient 's risk factor surgical site infection , include obesity , history incision complication , maternal diabetes , chorioamnionitis , potentially influence surgical skin prep apply . Finally , majority postpartum infection manifest hospital discharge post-discharge infection diagnose treat entirely ambulatory setting , without patient ' return hospital . The purpose study : 1 . To compare chlorhexidine base solution , iodine povidone solution , combination agent cesarean delivery skin preparation solution prevention surgical site infection ( SSI ) 2 . To determine surgical site infection ( SSI ) risk factor guide selection one specific surgical skin preparation solution . This prospective randomize observational study woman present care Montefiore Medical Center . All patient undergo routine obstetrical care preparation cesarean delivery participate research study . All patient study receive pre-operative intravenous antibiotic pre-operatively part departmental protocol cesarean delivery . The patient randomize informed consent obtain one three group : Group 1 : Iodine povidone base skin preparation solution . Group 2 : Chlorhexidine base skin preparation solution Group 3 : Combination usage iodine povidone chlorhexidine base skin preparation solution . Sequentially numbered envelope contain group randomization patient create computer generate program occur prior commencement study . Surgical preparation follow departmental protocol patient study exception skin preparation . Once patient randomize skin preparation group , correspond skin preparation solution use accordance manufacturer 's guideline product Departmental protocol . If randomize group 3 ( combination ) , iodine base preparation occur first follow chlorhexidine base skin preparation . All group wait minimal 4 minute prior skin incision application skin prep , patient surgically drape standard drape participate study . Cesarean delivery occur follow technique surgeon , include skin closure method , suture staple . All patient follow routine postpartum visit occur 6-8 week follow delivery . Postpartum visit information extract medical record .
