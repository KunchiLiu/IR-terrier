	<detailed_description>Primary Objective : To evaluate change body weight , fitness , bi-manual dexterity , exercise motivation self-reported eating behavior ( via questionnaire ) 16-week exercise intervention ( EOT ) 12 24 week post-EOT , obese EC patient randomize perform 'assisted ' voluntary exercise . Secondary Objectives : Objective 1 : To objectively examine food behavior determine neuronal response high- versus low-calorie visual stimulus fast ( hunger ) fed ( satiate ) state stop/go signal ( SST ) feed state brain region interest ( reward motivation circuitry ) use blood oxygenation level dependent ( BOLD ) functional MRI 16-week exercise intervention ( EOT ) 12 24 week post-intervention obese EC patient perform 'assisted ' voluntary exercise . Objective 2 : To examine modification neuronal response high vs. low calorie food image region interest polymorphism key gene ( e.g. , dopamine receptor dopamine transporter ) serum biomarkers ( e.g. , leptin , BDNF ) involve regulate homeostatic non-homeostatic energy system . Patients randomize receive either assist exercise ( n=60 ) voluntary exercise ( n=60 ) group . Subjects voluntary group exercise stationary recumbent exercise cycle pedal preferred rate . Subjects assist exercise group cycle stationary exercise bike ; however , motor provide assistance patient order maintain pedal rate 35 % great voluntary rate . Subjects exercise group complete 45 minute 1-hour session , three time per week eight week . The control group ask complete exercise , body composition fMRI test similar exercise group .</detailed_description>
