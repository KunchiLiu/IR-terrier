	<detailed_description>The investigator propose test feasibility preliminary efficacy 5-times per week daily attentional retraining ( AR ) deliver via portable electronic device ( PED ) comparison control condition course 2-3 week training period . Participants study cocaine opioid-dependent individual stabilize methadone . Both cocaine opioids target AR procedure investigator test study . The retrain control condition , along series assessment , deliver PED part daily ( Monday Friday ) appointment time participant also obtain daily methadone dose . Assessments cover substance use , crave issue . In addition complete retrain control procedure , participant also engage standard version attentional bias task ( i.e. , without retrain ) periodically order gauge effect study condition attentional bias time . Thus , investigator able track change attentional bias time detailed fashion previously possible .
