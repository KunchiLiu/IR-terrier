	<detailed_description>Chronic heart failure European country occur 2-3 % population significant increase high age group ( 1 ) . Improved treatment acute condition ( especially myocardial infarction ) result patient enter category chronic heart failure . Chronic heart failure poor prognosis . Diagnosis treatment challenge medically economically . Half patient systolic heart failure die within 4 year 50 % patient severe heart failure ( NYHA functional class IV ) die within one year ( 1 ) . The current treatment heart failure aim influencing symptom , also prevent progression heart failure reduce mortality . Heart failure lead activation compensatory mechanism design restore adequate cardiac output . These mechanism initially beneficial , long-term activation lead progression pathological process deterioration cardiac function . One basic pathophysiological process heart failure excessive activation sympathetic nervous system . This cause increased level circulate catecholamine proportional severity disease patient high level norepinephrine bad prognosis . Beta-blocker therapy design inhibit activity sympathetic nervous system cause mild symptom heart failure patient modify disturbed hemodynamics ultimately clinical status . In recent year , therapeutic efficacy beta-blockers chronic heart failure verify number control clinical trial ( 2-5 ) . These study confirm long-term treatment beta-blocker therapy alleviate symptom heart failure , improve clinical condition patient reduce mortality like ACE inhibitor . High activity renal sympathetic nerve patient chronic heart failure early predictor increase mortality ( 6 ) . The main pathophysiological basis find probably excessive sodium retention due direct activation sympathetic fiber innervate renal tubule ( 7 ) . Recent experimental work animal show surgical renal denervation inhibits increase renal vascular resistance , prevents decrease renal blood flow ( 8 ) , also prevent change expression angiotensin receptor kidney ( 8 ) . Surgical sympathectomy begin used treatment severe malignant hypertension 50 year ago . But rather complicated procedure , accompany number adverse effect ( orthostatic hypotension tachycardia , shortness breath , bowel sexual disorder ] . Moreover require long hospitalization 2-4 week require recovery period 1-2 month . However intervention lead rapid decrease pressure high survival rate surgery large observational study ( 9 ) . In recent year method develop destruction renal sympathetic nerve present adventitia renal arterial wall do catheterization ( 10 ) . This procedure use catheter radiofrequency ablator tip ( Symplicity , Ardian / Medtronic , USA ) , introduce femoral artery progressively introduce renal artery . A randomized study demonstrate procedure high degree safety patient high rate efficacy well . In patient resistant hypertension treat transcatheter renal denervation significant drop blood pressure 33/11 mmHg ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) occur 6 month compare control group receive unmodified pharmacological treatment ( 11 ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients 18 year age chronic heart failure , ischemic nonischemic etiology . NYHA ( New York Heart Association ) class IIIV . LVEF ( Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ) â‰¤ 35 % . Patients treat maximum tolerated dos standard pharmacotherapy heart failure , stable least four week without acute decompensated heart failure . Prior enrollment , patient must give informed consent . Patients history acute coronary syndrome stroke within last 6 month . Significant valvular defect and/or plan cardiac surgery . Systolic blood pressure &lt; 110 mmHg . Advanced renal insufficiency ( estimate GFR ( Glomerular Filtration Rate ) accord MDRD &lt; 30 ml/min/1.73 square meter ) . Unsuitable anatomy renal artery ( presence significant renal stenosis , renal artery narrower 4 mm ) . Patients underwent renal angioplasty stent placement renal artery past . Severe coagulation disorder . Pregnancy lactation . Refusal patient . Other disease limit prognosis patient le 2 year . Other reason opinion attend physician would preclude individual participating study .</criteria>
