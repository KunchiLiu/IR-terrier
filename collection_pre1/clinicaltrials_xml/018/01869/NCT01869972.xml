	<brief_summary>Phenylketonuria ( PKU ) rare disease level phenylalanine ( one amino acid ) body greatly increase . High level cause brain damage , especially baby child . This brain damage prevent special low phenylalanine diet start soon birth . A new drug , sapropterin , also low phenylalanine level patient . PKU therapy monitor measure blood phenylalanine every week , goal keep level within target range . Recently , study suggest variation blood phenylalanine may important absolute blood phenylalanine level brain outcome . The investigator look variation blood phenylalanine level 24 hour see much level change . The investigator measure patient typical PKU compliant diet patient compliant diet . The investigator also measure patient `` mild '' PKU usually high level phenylalanine . Finally , investigator see patient sapropterin low variation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Biological Variation Phenylalanine Patients With Hyperphenylalaninemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phenylketonuria ( OMIM 261600 ) result inherited deficiency enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase , ( PAH , Enzyme Classification 1.14.16.1 ) . A deficiency enzyme lead elevate blood tissue level amino acid phenylalanine upon exposure normal amount dietary protein . The elevated phenylalanine brain harmful cognitive development , usually result permanent severe mental retardation . Soon development special dietary treatment PKU simple screen test detect elevate phenylalanine , newborn screen PKU become widespread early detection treatment largely prevent severe neurological effect PKU . With population-based detection hyperphenylalaninemia , soon become apparent significant biological variation phenylalanine level patient ( i.e . inter-individual biological variation ) phenylketonuria ( PKU ) form part classification system hyperphenylalaninemia ( i.e . benign hyperphenylalaninemia , mild , moderate classical phenylketonuria ) . While variation classification system exist , commonly `` classical '' PKU refers individual plasma phenylalanine level great 1200 µmol/L unrestricted diet . `` Moderate '' PKU refers level 900 1200 µmol/L , `` mild '' PKU refers level 600 900 µmol/L . `` Non-PKU '' `` benign '' hyperphenylalaninemia refers phenylalanine level less 600 µmol/L unrestricted diet , great normal phenylalanine level ( &lt; 100 µmol/L ) , historically prescribe dietary restriction phenylalanine . This inter-individual variation generally due variable residual enzyme activity genotype PKU patient . Intra-individual variation ( change phenylalanine level one individual ) observe clinician treat PKU . While variation simply expression underlie genotype patient 's dietary phenylalanine level exceeds prescribe amount ( i.e . `` cheat '' diet ) , variation represent shift anabolic catabolic state diurnal pattern intercurrent illness . While overall exposure high phenylalanine long know adversely affect IQ score , recently increase variability phenylalanine level report link low IQ , highlight importance improve understanding intra-individual variation . New treatment PKU , therefore , need assess term effect biological variation phenylalanine . Sapropterin dihydrochloride ( KuvanTM ) small molecule drug lower phenylalanine level patient phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency direct interaction enzyme . The pharmacokinetics KuvanTM evaluate adult undergo evaluation pediatric patient , however , biological effect KuvanTM term lower blood phenylalanine level would expect longer profile blood level drug half-life activate enzyme would longer . This suggest KuvanTM may modulate effect variation blood phenylalanine level PKU patient . In observational study , investigator directly measure short-term biological variation blood phenylalanine hyperphenylalaninemic patient frequent measurement phenylalanine level 24 hour period . The investigator enroll subject already follow one two study site treat diet alone treat KuvanTM therapy ( +/- diet ) . During 24 hour period subject ask maintain typical diet/therapy . Hypothesis : Biological variation less KuvanTM treat patient classical phenylketonuria treat diet alone . OBJECTIVES : Determine short-term biologic variation people hyperphenylalaninemia , without KuvanTM therapy .</detailed_description>
