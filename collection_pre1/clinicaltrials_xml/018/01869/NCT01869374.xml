	<brief_summary>To evaluate feasibility , tolerability efficacy Magnetic Seizure Therapy ( MST ) elderly patient major depressive episode , randomly assign receive acute course MST ECT . The investigator hypothesize : 1 . MST ECT similar antidepressant efficacy 2 . MST less post-treatment amnesia ECT reflect primary measure anterograde retrograde amnesia follow acute treatment phase . 3 . At follow , MST show less degree persist deficit measure retrograde amnesia ECT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Comparing Magnetic Seizure Therapy ( MST ) Electroconvulsive Therapy ( ECT ) Depression Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study compare clinical efficacy side effect Magnetic Seizure Therapy ( MST ) Electroconvulsive Therapy ( ECT ) old adult currently experience major depressive episode context either unipolar bipolar depression . ECT know highly effective treat depression , adverse cognitive side effect . MST new form convulsive therapy develop mean improve side effect profile ECT patient may benefit without suffer significant detrimental effect cognition . Both ECT MST rely therapeutic seizure , different way . In ECT , electrical stimulator use pass electrical current two electrode place surface person 's head , cause electricity go brain cause seizure . In MST , magnetic stimulator use create magnetic field target area brain , induces small electrical field neuron cause seizure . Treatments administer three time week . In addition treatment session , study involve number assessment different time-points ( i.e. , baseline prior treatment , post-treatment , 2 month post-treatment 6 month post-treatment ) use evaluate person 's antidepressant response physical cognitive side effect treatment .</detailed_description>
