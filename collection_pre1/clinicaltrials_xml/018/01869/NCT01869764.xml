	<brief_title>Omega-3 Fatty Acid Treating Patients With Stage I-III Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine omega-3 dietary supplementation ( omega-3 fatty acid ) result higher polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) level surgical specimen normal malignant breast tissue woman take omega 3 tablet comparison take placebo . II . To determine omega-3 dietary supplementation result higher PUFA level plasma red blood cell woman take omega 3 tablet comparison take placebo . III . To determine omega-3 dietary supplementation affect metabolites omega-3 omega-6 PUFA surgical specimen malignant normal breast tissue comparison control . IV . To determine woman take omega-3 dietary supplementation less proliferation great apoptosis malignant breast tissue comparison woman take placebo . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive omega-3 fatty acid orally ( PO ) daily 7-14 day . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO daily 7-14 day .</detailed_description>
