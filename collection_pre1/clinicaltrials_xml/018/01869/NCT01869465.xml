	<detailed_description>Schistosomiasis one important parasitic infection child particularly Sub-Saharan Africa age relate pattern water contact explain high prevalence intensity S. mansoni infection child . If leave untreated , schistosomiasis result retard growth impairment cognitive function especially among school child . Repeated treatment early stage life long-lasting effect morbidity later age . Focusing delivery regular chemotherapy young age group produce maximum benefit prevents chronic sequela adulthood . In 2001 , World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommend treatment program schistosomiasis target school-age child could reach primary school system , collaboration education sector . This method consider affordable cost-effective goal provide regular treatment least 75 % school-age child risk morbidity year 2010 . The Ugandan national program control schistosomiasis adopt WHO recommendations 2003 since support Mass Drug Administration ( MDA ) praziquantel , single dose drug know efficacy safety , high burden community include primary school . The current national Health Sector Strategic Investment Plan ( HSSIP ) underscore schistosomiasis one diseases target elimination year 2015 . In Jinja , implementation control program schistosomiasis start August 2003 scale endemic area district . Annual mass treatment use praziquantel albendazole schistosomiasis soil transmit helminth ( STH ) , respectively , target school-age child adult risk infection . Preventive measure focus raise awareness schistosomiasis include distribution information , education communication material health education especially primary school also wider community . These provide prior MDA . In primary school , teacher train distribute drug child fill treatment register . These activity support parallel structure within Ministry Health external funding United States Agency International Development ( USAID ) channel Research Triangle Institute ( RTI ) International Previous research undertaken among adult high endemic district Busia , Adjumani , Moyo Nebbi report unwillingness take preventive treatment . A particular study conduct primary school Jinja district show 30 % school child take praziquantel 2011 MDA . Fear side effect praziquantel , lack knowledge schistosomiasis transmission prevention lack teacher support major factor associate low uptake . Similar reason non-uptake report elsewhere . Thus , measure need increase uptake MDA Uganda . There doubt health education facilitate well understand obvious risk health , include knowledge prevent parasitic infection among primary school child . Better compliance treatment schistosomiasis among school child achieve implement carefully design program involve face face education method . Increasing knowledge schistosomiasis transmission prevention implement measure mitigate side effect attributable praziquantel , provide snack prior drug administration may improve uptake drug among school child . Study objective : The objective study determine efficacy specific message schistosomiasis control prevention alone combination provision pre-treatment snack improve uptake preventive treatment intestinal schistosomiasis among primary school child . Methods - Study design This stratified cluster randomize control trial . The reason adopt stratified cluster randomization study include follow : 1 . The study involve evaluation intervention ( specific message schistosomiasis transmission control ) nature , implement community school level . 2 . Logistical convenience avoid resentment contamination might occur unblinded intervention provide individual others community 3 . In study , desire capture mass effect apply intervention large proportion primary school child e.g . reduction prevalence intensity infection . 4 . The efficacy intervention establish individual level desire measure effectiveness intervention apply community-wide basis . - Study set The study conduct Walukuba Division , Jinja District , South Eastern Uganda . Schistosoma mansoni highly endemic Division prevalence 35 % among school child [ 24 ] . Lake Victoria border Division south main source S. mansoni infection . The Division total population 40,882 . The main socio-economic activity area include agriculture ( subsistence farming ) , fish , petty trade main land island . There 12 primary school Division , majority ( 8/12 ) within 5 km distance Lake . - Implementation MDA primary school MDA primary school Division implement annual basis standalone intervention . School teacher in-charge health sanitation focal person MDA . Prior MDA praziquantel albendazole , grade teacher sensitize respective child schistosomiasis prevention , include take preventive treatment , mobilize prepare receive treatment . This do group ( grade ) basis . During MDA , classroom school organize drug administration child invite indiscriminately , accord grade , receive treatment . One grade invite time . Praziquantel distribute accord height child use standard dose pole . In addition , child receives single tablet albendazole . Both drug distribute teacher child swallow tablet use water observation teacher also record treatment register . - Randomization The 12 primary school Walukuba Division randomize two arm ; ) receive specific message schistosomiasis transmission control ( hereafter refer education arm ) ii ) receive specific message schistosomiasis transmission control plus pre-treatment snack ( hereafter refer snack arm ) . The 12 school stratify accord uptake praziquantel 2 stratum ; low uptake stratum ( &lt; 50 % uptake ) high uptake stratum ( â‰¥50 % uptake ) . This ensure good balance school characteristic arm . Randomization education snack arm perform within stratum use computer generate program STATA 10.0 ( TX , USA ) Sample size A total sample size 1,277 child examine 12 primary school . At 95 % power 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) , assume uptake praziquantel increase 49 % ( previous study ) 75 % ( WHO target ) , sample size require detect increase 96 education arm 96 snack arm ( STATA 10.0 , TX , USA ) . This sample size adjust 5 % non-response 101 . A design effect 6.3 previous study apply obtain minimum sample size 636 education arm 636 snack arm -Sampling data collection Children grade ( year ) 4-6 12 primary school randomly select participate study . This child grade 4-6 10-14 year age peak age schistosomiasis infection Uganda . A proportionate number child select school grade use probability proportional size school grade population . Systematic sampling , use grade register sample frame , names child arrange alphabetical order , employ . The sample interval obtain divide total population grade number child study grade ( N/n ) . After obtain random start table random number , interval follow require number child grade obtain . Face face interview select child conduct trained research assistant use structured questionnaire multiple choice question . After interview , stool specimen collect child , process examine S. mansoni infection . Children fail provide stool specimens examination replace randomly select equal number child grade 4-6 .</detailed_description>
