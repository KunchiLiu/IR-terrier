	<brief_summary>The aim study investigate randomize controlled fashion whether recurrence complication rate , insertion subperiosteal drainage treatment chronic subdural haematoma , high compare insertion subdural drainage . We hypothesize patient treated subperiosteal drainage show high recurrence rate treat subdural drainage , suffer less complication .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Prospective Randomized Study Evaluating Recurrence Rate Chronic Subdural Hematoma After Placing Subperiosteal Drainage Compared Subdural Drainage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic subdural haematoma ( cSDH ) one frequent neurosurgical entity , affect elderly people associate substantial morbidity mortality . Its incidence report 1.7-13.1 per 100000 inhabitant per year , yet steady increase incidence result prolong life expectancy recent year . Surgical treatment recommend case neurological symptom . In evidence base review different surgical treatment modality cSDH , Weigels study group conclude bure-hole craniostomy irrigation drainage best cure complication ratio . A randomize control study Santarius colleague show reduced recurrence mortality place subdural drainage compare drainage burr hole evacuation cSDH . Gazzeri et al . Zumofen et al . use closed subperiosteal drainage instead commonly used subdural drainage . They show equal superior result outcome , complication postoperative symptom compare previous study . Since subperiosteal drainage position direct contact cortical structure , bridge vein haematoma membrane consider safer favored subdural drainage . Bellut et al . compare institute retrospectively 48 patient treated subperiosteal drainage 65 patient subdural drainage find difference recurrence rate cSDH , yet less mortality fewer serious complication group treat subperiosteal drainage . However study none result show significant difference , conclude randomize study large patient number need . In recently publish prospective randomize study Kaliaperumal et al . conclude recurrence rate subperiosteal drainage equal subdural drainage , yet modify rank scale ( mRS ) patient subperiosteal drainage 6 month significantly well . However , mRS score preoperative good subperiosteal drain group cause statistical bias . In addition amount patient study small ( 25 per group ) recurrence rate overall 0 % , low morbidity mortality compare literature . Due bias author recommend prospective randomize study large group patient . To date neurosurgery practice evidence base guideline drainage use cSDH exist method , subdural drainage subperiosteal drainage , practice , depend institute and/or practice neurosurgeon . The aim study investigate randomize controlled fashion whether recurrence complication rate , insertion subperiosteal drainage treatment chronic subdural haematoma , high compare insertion subdural drainage .</detailed_description>
