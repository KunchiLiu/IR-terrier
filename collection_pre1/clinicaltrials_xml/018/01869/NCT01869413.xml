Significant blood loss may result cardiovascular morbidity , use blood product expensive expose patient risk . Tranexamic acid reduces breakdown hemostatic blood clot therapeutic benefit use surgical procedure reduce blood loss need transfusion .

	<brief_title>Tranexamic Acid During Cystectomy Trial ( TACT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Removal bladder adjacent organ patient bladder cancer ( radical cystectomy ) often result significant blood loss , approximately 60 % patient require peri-operative blood transfusion . Reducing blood loss frequency transfusion offer several benefit , include donor blood conservation , health care cost reduction , avoidance blood product exposure . Tranexamic acid amino acid lysine derivative strong antifibrinolytic clotting property administer systemically . This medication use variety operative procedure , notably high risk cardiac surgery , decrease peri-operative blood loss , associate acceptable risk adverse event . Systemic anti-hemorrhagics infrequently use radical cystectomy , investigator knowledge effect evaluate clinical trial . Overall objective : To conduct randomize controlled trial systemic tranexamic acid compare placebo reduce number blood transfusion patient undergo radical cystectomy bladder cancer . Design : A multi-center , randomize , double-blinded , placebo control trial . Study population : Consenting patient 18 year age old undergoing radical cystectomy bladder cancer , exclude : unwilling receive blood product due personal reason , pregnant , active angina , know allergy tranexamic acid , know personal history deep venous thrombosis , atrial fibrillation , coronary stent , sub-arachnoid hemorrhage , pulmonary embolism , thrombotic stroke / acquire disturbance colour vision . The study recruit 354 patient Dalhousie University , McGill University , Université de Montreal , Université Laval , University Ottawa , University Western Ontario University Alberta . Intervention : Tranexamic Acid arm : Tranexamic acid administer intravenous infusion 10 mg/kg within 10 minute ( load dose ) surgical incision , follow 5 mg/kg/hour continuous maintenance infusion length surgery ( typically 4 8 hour ) . For example , 80 kg patient would receive 800 mg prior incision 400 mg/hour infusion duration surgery . For 6 hour procedure , total dose administer would 3200 mg . Placebo arm : As standard care concern administration antifibrinolytic agent cystectomy procedure , control follow dose schedule describe , 0.9 % saline infusion . Outcomes : The primary research objective whether use systemic tranexamic acid compare placebo reduces proportion radical cystectomy patient require red blood cell transfusion 30 day post-operative ( 50 % transfusion rate placebo 35 % tranexamic acid ) . Secondary question : Will use systemic tranexamic acid compare placebo result reduction : ) intraoperative blood loss , ii ) amount transfuse blood product , iii ) post-operative complication ? The safety ( thrombotic event ) tranexamic acid also evaluate . Importance study : If tranexamic acid reduces number blood transfusion , immediate impact cystectomy patient , surgeon may consider routine use systemic tranexamic acid similar abdomino-pelvic procedure associate significant blood loss .</detailed_description>
