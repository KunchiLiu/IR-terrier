	<brief_summary>This study aim determine feasibility obtain molecularly characterize pre-treatment tumor biopsy , determine feasibility obtain molecularly characterize archival post-treatment tumor biopsy , assess molecular expression change archival baseline tumor sample , assess molecular expression change tumor sample obtain baseline time disease progression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Feasibility Study Genomic Sequencing Find Potential Targets Personalized Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study companion study exist phase I clinical trial treatment study . It do determine feasibility obtain tumor tissue genomic analysis . Patient offer enrollment trial time consider participation phase I treatment trial . After consent study , patient undergo fresh tumor biopsy collection research blood sample . Archived tumor specimen also obtain analyze . At time disease progression , fresh tumor biopsy blood sample collect patient evaluable pre-biopsy specimen eligible screen another study . This informative evaluate mechanism resistance agent .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Have advance solid hematological malignancy resistant standard therapy standard therapy available . Being consider early phase clinical trial investigational agent use either alone combination chemotherapy radiation . Patients decline enroll companion study deny participation primary treatment protocol . Patients participate phase IIII clinical treatment trial tissue biopsy already require , patient standard care tumor biopsy procedure plan , e.g . confirm metastatic recurrence palliative resection tumor , would also eligible participation trial . Have primary metastatic tumor lesion amenable biopsy resection . Patients whose tumor safely biopsied fine needle aspiration core needle biopsy still eligible participate aspect trial involve collection archival tumor blood . Age ≥ 18 year old . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ≤ 2 . Life expectancy &gt; 2 month . Creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min ( applicable undergoing CTguided biopsy require IV contrast enhancement ) . For patient advanced solid malignancy , adequate hematologic function define absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1,000/mm^3 , platelet count ≥ 50,000/mm^3 , white blood cell count ( WBC ) ≥ 3,000/ mm^3 , hemoglobin ≥ 8 g/dL . International normalized ratio ( INR ) ≤ 1.5 . Patients warfarin therapy must able safely withhold warfarin bridge lowmolecular weight therapy demonstrate INR ≤ 1.5 prior biopsy . Able understand willingness sign write informed consent document , agree baseline and/or posttreatment tumor biopsy and/or blood collection . Patients qualify tumor biopsy due laboratory abnormality still eligible participate aspect trial involve collection blood . Have know suspected bleeding disorder investigator 's opinion would increase risk bleed biopsy procedure . Patients qualify tumor biopsy due know suspected bleeding disorder still eligible participate aspect trial involve collection archival tumor blood . Patients exclude participation study pretreatment biopsy , investigator 's opinion , significantly delay enrollment treatment clinical trial . Patients wait slot availability undergoing require washout prior therapy eligible enroll . Patients active uncontrolled bacterial , fungal viral infection . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration , may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator would make patient inappropriate entry study . Pregnant breast feeding .</criteria>
