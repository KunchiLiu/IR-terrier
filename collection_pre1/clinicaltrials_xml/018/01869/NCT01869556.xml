	<brief_summary>Patients Cesarean section labor many hour bleed much , average twice much , compare patient elective Cesarean section . The investigator believe simple change practice might contribute reduce bleed . This study involve use oxytocin ( also know syntocinon ) , ergonovine ( also know ergot ) carboprost ( also know hemabate ) . Oxytocin routinely use help contract uterus keep contract delivery baby placenta , reduce amount blood loss . Ergonovine also give intravenous line , carboprost give injection muscle . Although routinely give every case , frequently give rescue medication patient fail respond appropriately oxytocin . This study design determine ergonovine carboprost give association oxytocin , preventive way , delivery baby placenta , reduce amount blood loss Cesarean section follow trial labour .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison IV Ergonovine With IM Carboprost , With Oxytocin IV , During Cesarean Section Failure Progress</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective investigator study compare efficacy intravenous ergonovine intramuscular carboprost , administer oxytocin infusion , prophylactically decrease blood loss Cesarean section labor arrest . Desensitization oxytocin receptor recently demonstrate cultured human myometrial cell continuous prolonged exposure oxytocin in-vitro . This could also reason great risk uterine atony postpartum hemorrhage ( PPH ) see woman require induction augmentation labor . Therefore , addition different uterotonic agent , involve different mechanism action , oxytocin infusion likely beneficial , especially woman undergo CS follow failure progress labor , great risk PPH .</detailed_description>
