	<brief_summary>To evaluate safety efficacy MGuard™ Prime stent treatment block artery coronary artery patient undergo stenting procedure due heart attack . The MGuard Prime stent wil compare FDA approve bare-metal ( BMS ) drug-eluting ( DES ) coronary stent . The hypothesis ( 1 ) MGuard Prime stent achieve high rate complete ST-segment resolution see post-procedure ECG compare comparator stent , similar effect rate all-cause death recurrent target vessel myocardial infarction 365 day post-procedure .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject 18 year age Subject experience clinical symptom consistent acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) 30 minute less 12 hour duration . ST elevation 2 mm per lead 2 contiguous lead present one ECG prior consent . Subject agree require followup procedure visit . Subject legal representative provide write , informed consent . The target lesion de novo lesion native coronary artery . Based coronary anatomy , PCI indicate culprit lesion anticipate use stenting . The reference vessel diameter ( RVD ) infarct lesion 2.75 4.0 mm visual assessment , assess either baseline ( direct stenting plan ) , predilatation thrombus aspiration ( direct stenting plan ) . The entire lesion length require treatment le 24 mm ( able cover single study stent ) , assess either baseline ( direct stenting plan ) , predilatation thrombus aspiration ( direct stenting plan ) TIMI flow 2/3 present prior randomization ( case baseline TIMI flow 0/1 , blood flow must restore ) . Left bundle branch block ( LBBB ) , pace rhythm , ECG abnormality interfere assessment STsegment . Currently enrol another investigational device drug trial complete primary endpoint clinically interfere current study endpoint . A previous coronary interventional procedure kind within 30 day prior procedure . Female patient childbearing potential . Subject undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( patient cardiopulmonary resuscitation successfully perform normal mental status achieve , may enrol ) . Cardiogenic shock ( SBP le 80 mmHg hemodynamic support device hypotension ) . The subject require staged procedure target vessel ( include branch ) within 12 month nontarget vessel within 7 day postprocedure . The target lesion require treatment device PTCA prior stent placement ( , limit excimer laser , rotational atherectomy , etc. ) . Manual thrombus aspiration may use per operator discretion , rheolytic thrombectomy permit procedural complication randomization . Prior administration thrombolytic therapy current admission Comorbid condition ( ) could limit subject 's ability participate trial comply followup requirement , impact scientific integrity trial . Concurrent medical condition life expectancy le 12 month . History cerebrovascular accident transient ischemic attack within last 6 month , permanent neurologic deficit Prior intracranial bleed time , know intracranial pathology ( e.g . tumor , arteriovenous malformation , aneurysm ) . Active recent site major bleed within 6 month . History bleed diathesis coagulopathy inability accept blood transfusion . Known hypersensitivity contraindication either ) aspirin , heparin bivalirudin ; ii ) clopidogrel , ticlopidine , prasugrel ticagrelor ; iii ) cobalt nickel ; iv ) contrast medium , adequately premedicated ( prior anaphylaxis , however , absolute contraindication enrollment ) . Known serum creatinine level 2.5 mg/dl , hemoglobin le 10 g/dL platelet count le 150,000 present admission within 7 day prior index procedure , available . Surgery plan reason necessitate discontinuation dual antiplatelet therapy ( aspirin ADP antagonist ) within 12 month Aortic dissection mechanical complication STEMI Unprotected leave main stenosis 50 % . Multivessel intervention require index procedure . Excessive tortuosity , calcification diffuse distal disease A noninfarct lesion stenosis 50 % present target vessel Target lesion bifurcation side branch 2.0 mm diameter . Target lesion site within vessel previously implant stent Target lesion within bypass graft conduit , reach passing study stent bypass graft conduit In Investigator 's opinion lesion/vessel unsuitable treatment study stent reason . The lesion require use atherectomy , thrombectomy ( include manual thrombus aspiration catheter ) , laser device , proximal distal embolic protection device prior randomization .
