	<brief_summary>The purpose study test wound find outside body surface investigational medical imaging device collect visual picture thermal digital picture wound site . The investigational device approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . The medical imaging device non-contacting non-radiating ( delivers energy body ) . It passively collect picture ( typical digital color photograph ) thermal picture ( black white digital photograph heat body surface . )</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Measuring Wounds Found Outside Body Surface</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective study utilizes WoundVision Wound Measuring Monitoring System ( WMMS ) study external wound , currently measure length width use ruler . WMMS operate take simultaneous visual thermal image external wound site associate body surface . These image evaluate utilizing WMMS ImageReview measure monitoring software . WMMS ImageReview software allow LxW ( length width ) surface area ( cm square ) , well perimeter ( cm ) external wound measurement visual image . WMMS ImageReview software also allow display thermal intensity variation data associate body surface correspond thermal image . This study primarily design utilize Coefficients Individual Agreement ( CIA ) mean establish equivalence area measurement utilize WMMS ImageReview software LxW technique current `` gold standard '' LxW manual ruler technique . A secondary objective measure thermal intensity variation data external wound bed overlay correspond `` Visual External Wound Trace '' visual image onto thermal wound bed .</detailed_description>

Have qualify external wound site : External wound whose external wound site fit entirely within field view wrap around body edge . No device treatment obscure external wound site Neonatal pediatric patient Pregnant woman Can tolerate position change 10 minute comfortably ( per external wound site image ) Can position image take approximately 90 degree perpendicular 18 inch away external wound site On therapy treatment safely suspend long enough conduct image session determine facility policy Have external wound dress medical device remove determined site investigator Have external wound excessive heavy exudate control imaging session . Excessive drainage obscure external wound feature Have complex external wound site ( ) : The external wound wrap around body edge otherwise image entirely within visual field view From visual assessment exist external wound clearly distinguish condition external wound site ( e.g . break deterioration surround body surface due condition cancer type wound make determine edge external wound impossible ) Have provide sign informed consent NonEnglish speaking</criteria>
