	<brief_summary>Venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) , include deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) pulmonary embolism ( PE , one common preventable complication hospital stay . VTE prophylaxis use evidence-based anticoagulant medication option mechanical prophylaxis show reduce risk improve patient safety . Despite abundance evidence , use VTE prophylaxis remain low . This study assess effectiveness quality improvement strategy ( use pre-printed order , audit feedback , involvement pharmacist project need reminder physician , education staff ) use appropriate VTE prophylaxis . The study aim measure use strategy improve use VTE prophylaxis therefore , improve patient safety patient care reduce risk develop DVT PE .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study include 8 Toronto area hospital consist 7 community hospital one academic health science centre . Three patient group site include study : patient admit : Acute Medical Illness ( AMI ) , Major General Surgery ( MGS ) Hip Fracture Surgery ( HFS ) . Patients least 18 year old consider risk VTE accord American College Chest Physicians ( CHEST ) guideline . The study design cluster randomize trial patient group site cluster . A baseline chart audit approximately 50 patient group site conduct determine intraclass coefficient proportion adherence . The main outcome measure rate prescribe appropriate prophylaxis patient risk . This calculated number risk patient receive appropriate prophylaxis / number risk patient prophylaxis indicate . Based baseline result , estimate sample size 432 would need intervention phase . A sample 720 patient ( 15 cluster site ) include . The study break three phase : baseline , phase 1 phase 2 . At baseline , group receive usual care . At phase 1 , one cluster site randomize intervention two serve control . In phase 2 , 2 group receive intervention one continue serve control . Each phase , phase 1 2 360 unique patient . Patients baseline include phase 1 2 patient phase 1 include phase 2 . The main outcome measure prescribe appropriate VTE prophylaxis . A chart audit use collect data baseline , end phase 1 end phase 2 . Each phase approximately 1 year length . Analysis involve descriptive statistic use count proportion capture rate appropriate VTE prophylaxis rate non-adherence . A logistic regression model use compare rate appropriate VTE prophylaxis time within group adjust cluster .</detailed_description>
