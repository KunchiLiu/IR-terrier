	<brief_summary>The present study intend evaluate safety tolerability topical OC-10X Ophthalmic Suspension healthy human subject . OcuCure Therapeutics , Inc. ( Roanoke , VA ) develop lead compound , know OC-10X , selective tubulin inhibitor development treatment Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy ( PDR ) Age-related Macular Degeneration ( AMD ) . When administered topical eye drop , OC-10X demonstrate anti-angiogenic ( inhibition ) angiolytic ( regression ) property animal model AMD . Unlike therapy , OC-10X provide efficacy vascular target agent without traditional toxicity work downstream independently growth factor . As demonstrated OcuCure 's preclinical data , tubulin inhibition use OC-10X promise new therapeutic approach . PDR major cause blindness adult also cause growth abnormal blood vessel . These new blood vessel fragile may hemorrhage vitreous . PDR affect 80 % diabetic diabetes 15 year . If administration OC-10X well tolerate topical eye drop well tolerate systemically , OC-10X potential provide benefit patient ocular disease associate angiogenesis .</brief_summary>
