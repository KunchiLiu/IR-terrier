	<brief_summary>As individual age , physical activity decrease sedentary time increase . Even small change two behavior greatly decrease risk several major health problem , include cardiovascular disease , diabetes , many cancer . Studies use pedometer encourage walk successfully increased physical activity , address sedentary behavior television watching . The investigator propose use novel pedometer-like device ( Jawbone Up ) encourages increase physical activity decrease sedentary time . First , investigator recruit 10 adult participate brief intervention six week . They wear wrist-based activity monitor use mini-tablet device see feedback activity sedentary time . They also receive brief counseling weekly . The investigator use first study investigate basic feasibility intervention material . Next , investigator recruit 20 adult randomize receive intervention 12 week wait list . Here , investigator test intervention refinement make base participant response first small study . Our primary outcome measure feasibility acceptability across part study . The investigator hypothesize intervention feasible acceptable participant . The investigator also measure physical activity , sedentary behavior , fitness , body fat , psychological feeling motivation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inadequate physical activity extend bout sedentary time prevalent adult , increase middle age old adulthood . Even small change behavior , stand walk place periodically break sedentary bout , large effect cardiometabolic risk factor . Pedometer-based walking intervention demonstrate effectiveness increase physical activity population , intervention target sedentary behavior . Recent technological advance produce activity monitor capable intervening behavior . These wrist-worn monitor provide feedback motivation walk well cue action form idle alert . These idle alert vibrate wearer remain sedentary extended period time . Several preliminary study show old adult willing break sedentary time prompt , intervention thus far rely upon television commercial cue action . Use monitor would allow idle alert occur throughout day , television watching period . The purpose IMPACT study ( Inactivity Monitoring Physical Activity Controlled Trial ) investigate feasibility use activity monitor simultaneously target physical activity sedentary behavior . First , conduct pre-pilot test ( N = 10 ) six week . This brief study provide basic feasibility acceptability information monitor , content weekly session , assessment . Results use refine intervention use large pilot two-arm randomize control trial ( N = 20 , 12 week ) . This trial , compare intervention wait-list control group , test feasibility , acceptability , health , behavioral , psychological outcome . The primary outcome physical activity , operationalized objectively-measured minute moderate-vigorous intensity physical activity seven day ( SenseWear armband ) . We also measure cardiorespiratory fitness , physical function , body composition , psychosocial variable autonomous motivation . The result innovative project provide foundation future intervention sedentary behavior potentially create large public health impact population unique risk .</detailed_description>
