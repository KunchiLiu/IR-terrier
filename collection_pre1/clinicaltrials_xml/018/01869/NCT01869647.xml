	<brief_summary>This third phase ( feasibility impact ) three-phase project design derive , validate test feasibility impact implement clinical decision support safely limit use Computerized Tomography ( CT ) accompany radiation cost emergency department patient suspect renal colic . Hypothesis : Using model , integration clinical prediction rule decision image patient suspect renal colic result reduction 25-50 % radiation receive CT scan population , without adverse affect patient-centered outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients clinician deems CT Flank Pain Protocol suspect kidney stone warrant base usual practice eligible enrollment . Clinicians encouraged page Research Associate ( RA ) prior order CT , automatic page go CT flank pain protocol order via EPIC . RAs approach eligible subject write informed consent . Subjects incapable unwilling provide inform consent , include non-English speaking patient exclude . Following write informed consent , eligibility S.T.O.N.E . score determine . Subjects consent enrollment exclusion criterion enrol observationally determine performance S.T.O.N.E . score outcome group , eligible alternate imaging pathway . Subjects exclusion criterion place one three group base S.T.O.N.E . score ( may supplement gestalt clinician pre-test probability and/or point-of-care ultrasound hydronephrosis ) . The group low , moderate , high correspond likelihood patient kidney stone describe result phase I II.Subjects `` high '' likelihood stone group eligible get either Ultra Low Dose Computerized Tomography ( ULDCT ) `` expectant management '' . The choice determine primary clinician conjunction patient . If ULDCT elect , scan read diagnostically radiologist clinician treat patient base result . If expectant management option chosen , CT do ED visit treat kidney stone . We attempt contact patient ~1 week ED visit , also option contact study team . If symptoms persistent week , subject may course pursue clinical care clinician choice bill study . Subjects `` moderate '' likelihood stone group give option receive either standard dose CT ULDCT . Again , decision image option choose make primary clinician conjunction patient . In `` low '' likelihood stone group RA present data stone score physician explain patient unlikely kidney stone advise probability stone low alternate imaging choice may warrant . If still choose order CT Flank Pain Protocol ask provide reason patient receive regular dose CT Flank Pain Protocol . All subject follow Emergency Department ( ED ) course follow-up care ( record EPIC ) , attempt contact patient ~90 day initial ED visit . Outcomes include number eligible patient receive regular dose CT , ULDCT , expectant management option . Radiation dose receive measured comparison expect radiation dose regular CT perform eligible patient use model phase I II . We also follow patient determine prevalence time diagnosis and/or intervention kidney stone pathology . We qualitatively compare prevalence alternative cause symptom incidental finding ( follow-up ) regular low dose CTs .</detailed_description>
