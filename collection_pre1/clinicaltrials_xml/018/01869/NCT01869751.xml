	<brief_summary>Chronic kidney disease associate accumulation various metabolite , i.e. , uremic retention solute . Evidence mount colonic microbiome contributes substantially uremic retention solute . Indoxyl sulfate p-cresyl sulfate among extensively study gut microbial metabolite , associate cardiovascular disease , chronic kidney disease progression overall mortality . Colonic transit time important determinant intestinal generation uptake bacterial metabolite . However , unknown accelerate colonic transit time reduce intestinal generation uptake indoxyl sulfate p-cresyl sulfate . Prucalopride selective , high-affinity 5-HT4 receptor agonist stimulate effect colonic motility transit . It currently use treat chronic slow-transit constipation . An observational study initiate non-chronic kidney disease patient chronic slow-transit constipation necessitate treatment prucalopride observe effect serum concentration intestinal generation indoxyl sulfate p-cresyl sulfate .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Age ≥ 18 ≤ 85 year Chronic slowtransit constipation define 4 criterion : 1. two few spontaneous complete bowel movement week minimum 6 month 2. one follow symptom least onequarter time : lumpy/hard stool , sensation incomplete evacuation , strain defecation . 3. slow transit time determine Rx colon transit study ( `` pellet '' ) 4. without evidence secondary constipation primary defecation disorder Need therapy prucalopride ( i.e. , inefficacy dietary change laxative ) Followup visit possible 4 week treatment Written inform consent History new diagnosis organic intestinal disease ( e.g. , inflammatory bowel disease , malignancy ) Secondary constipation ( druginduced , endocrine , metabolic neurological disorder , surgery , know suspect organic disorder large intestine , megacolon ) primary defecation disorder Use laxatives two day start treatment treatment period . If spontaneous bowel movement 3 consecutive day , rescue treatment bisacodyl and/or enema allow necessary Presence significant comorbidity ( uncontrolled heart , liver lung disease ) Pregnancy Chronic kidney disease , i.e. , estimate glomerular filtration rate ( MDRD ) &lt; 60 ml/min/m² need dialysis therapy</criteria>
