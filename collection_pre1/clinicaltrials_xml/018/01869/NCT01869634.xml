	<brief_summary>Potent HIV suppression Darunavir-based antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) lead repopulation gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue ( GALT ) cluster differentiation ( CD ) 4+ T-cell population , normalization systemic immune activation , improve HIV-associated cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) risk .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mechanisms Immune Reconstitution &amp; Reduced Immune Activation Following Darunavir-based ART</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale Infection HIV cause significant morbidity mortality , even among individual virologically suppress combination anti-retroviral therapy ( ART ) . ART effective prolong life enable individual HIV positive live near-normal life span . However , individual increasingly develop number chronic disease age , atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( ASCVD ) . The proposed study examine role highly active antiretroviral therapy restore mucosal immunity systemic effect immune activation , bacterial translocation , change HIV-associated cardiovascular disease risk .</detailed_description>
