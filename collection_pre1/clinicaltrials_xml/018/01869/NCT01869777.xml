	<brief_title>Bioelectrical Impedance Measurement Predicting Treatment Outcome Patients With Newly Diagnosed Acute Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I : To determine feasibility obtain standardized phase angle measurement ( bioelectrical impedance measurement ) patient hospitalize treatment newly diagnose acute leukemia . II . To evaluate association standardized phase angle measure start therapy treatment-related outcome include treatment related mortality ( define 60-day mortality ) III . Evaluate association day 14 standardized phase angle treatment relate outcome , 30-day mortality , length hospitalization , transfer intensive care unit induction , treatment response ( 14 day bone marrow response , complete remission ) , receipt post-remission therapy , overall survival . IV . An exploratory analysis investigate association primary secondary outcome use different way categorize baseline standardize phase angle , acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) patient , standardized phase angle measure obtain prior nadir marrow . OUTLINE : Patients undergo bioelectrical impedance phase angle measurement day 1 treatment . Patients AML undergo second measurement prior nadir marrow . Patients also undergo bioelectrical impedance measurement prior invasive procedure ( bone marrow biopsy , leukapheresis , peripherally inserted central catheter [ PICC ] line placement , etc. ) . After completion study treatment , patient follow two year .</detailed_description>
