	<brief_summary>A primary objective study evaluate vivo response tumor chemotherapy gene microarray analysis . Neoadjuvant treatment allow unique opportunity observe vivo effect cytotoxic therapy gene expression tumor tissue . The investigator plan evaluate several different question compare gene profile different phase treatment study . These outline . Hypotheses 1 . Chemotherapy enrich tumor cell population enhance resistance survival mechanism . These mechanism part identifiable change gene expression profile pre vs. post treatment . 2 . Use two distinct chemotherapy selection pressure , example DNA-damaging regimen ( epirubicin cyclophosphamide ) mitotic spindle/metabolic target regimen ( docetaxel capecitabine ) , allow identification small set gene associate resistance survival mechanisms broad importance . 3 . Genes associate enrichment resistance survival mechanism present large amount pretreatment tumor destine complete pathologic response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Large ER-Negative Breast Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The clinical outcome breast cancer treatment remarkably similar regardless regimen use , even though individual drug may differ substantially mechanisms action . We interested identify set gene may associate breast cancer cell survival follow selection chemotherapy . We intend use two different selection pressure ( different chemotherapy regimens different mechanism action ) order focus gene regulate similarly response either regimen . Neoadjuvant chemotherapy common use locally advance breast cancer . Although yet appear impart survival advantage , enhance likelihood breast conserving surgery also provide important prognostic information . Taxotere appear add significantly pathologic complete response add doxorubicin cyclophosphamide alone . The combination capecitabine docetaxel superior docetaxel alone metastatic disease . Many investigator interested incorporate regimen treatment earlier stag breast cancer .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written inform consent The diagnosis breast cancer make fineneedle aspiration ( FNA ) , core , trucut biopsy . Biopsy must demonstrate invasive adenocarcinoma . Patients must life expectancy least 1 year , exclude diagnosis cancer . Patients must mass clinical radiological examination &gt; 1 cm must confine either breast breast ipsilateral axilla . Multiple mass permit , provide one &gt; 1cm . Patients may enter prior ER Her2 status know , however Her2 positive , patient withdrawn treatment phase trial . Patients palpable mass distant metastasis and/or palpable supraclavicular lymphadenopathy allow definitive local treatment judge necessary . Patients may inflammatory breast cancer . Prior time entry , patient must follow : history physical exam blood test chest image within last 3 month ( chest xray , CT scan , PET/CT ) bilateral mammogram Ultrasound tumor placement clip localize tumor respond completely chemotherapy recommend Bone scan MRI breast clinically indicate . Patients clinically palpable lymph node recommend FNA biopsy document lymph node status . Patients may undergo sentinel node biopsy procedure prior preoperative chemotherapy . At time entry White blood cell count ( WBC ) &gt; 3,000 platelet count &gt; 100,000 bilirubin , serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase ( SGOT ) serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase ( SGPT ) , alkaline phosphatase , serum creatinine must &lt; 1.2 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) calculate creatinine clearance [ CockcroftGault ] &gt; 50 ml/min . normalized 1.73 m2 body surface area ( BSA ) . Patients benign hyperbilirubinemia also exclude . Patients bone pain eligible inclusion bone scan and/or roentgenological exam fail disclose metastatic disease , metastatic disease find , definitive local treatment perform . Patients nonbreast malignancy eligible receive prior chemotherapy , extensive radiation therapy , free disease least two year . Patients squamous basal carcinoma skin effectively treat , carcinoma situ cervix treat surgery eligible . Patients prior simultaneous lobular ductal carcinoma situ ipsilateral contralateral breast also eligible . Patients bilateral breast cancer least one breast cancer meet eligibility requirement also eligible . Has negative serum urine pregnancy test within 7 day prior initiation chemotherapy ( female patient childbearing potential ) . Patients Her2 positive breast cancer Pregnancy breast feeding time propose randomization . Women childbearing potential either positive pregnancy test baseline . Woman childbearing potential use reliable appropriate contraceptive method . ( Postmenopausal woman must amenorrheic least 12 month consider nonchildbearing potential ) . Patients agree continue contraception 30 day date last study drug administration . Participation investigational drug study within 4 week precede start study treatment . Prior unanticipated severe reaction fluoropyrimidine therapy , know sensitivity 5fluorouracil . Prior therapy breast cancer . Prior chemotherapy different breast cancer . Patients receive prior anthracycline therapy malignancy eligible . Nonmalignant systemic disease ( cardiovascular , renal , hepatic , etc . ) would preclude patient subject treatment option surgery would prevent prolonged followup . Active cardiac disease would preclude use epirubicin . This include : Any documented myocardial infarction unstable angina ; Any history document congestive heart failure ; Valvular disease document cardiac function compromise ; Patients cardiomegaly chest Xray , ventricular hypertrophy EKG , unless demonstrate adequate leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) &gt; 45 % MUltiple Gated Acquisition ( MUGA ) echocardiogram . Patients cardiac arrhythmia eligible , provide arrhythmia associate concomitant heart failure cardiac dysfunction . History uncontrolled seizure , central nervous system disorder psychiatric disability judge investigator clinically significant , preclude informed consent , interfere compliance oral drug intake . Lack physical integrity upper gastrointestinal tract malabsorption syndrome . Known , exist uncontrolled coagulopathy Unwillingness give write informed consent . Unwillingness participate inability comply protocol duration study .</criteria>
