	<brief_title>Study Test Whether Shoes Protect Children Against Hookworm Infection Pemba Island , Zanzibar</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Aim : To carry cluster randomise control trial ( non-blinded ) test field condition whether provision shoe school-aged child Pemba Island , Zanzibar , area high hookworm prevalence anaemia , could reduce transmission , incidence disease burden hookworm infection among susceptible population . Methods : Setting : Pemba Island northern two main island make Zanzibar archipelago , situate Indian Ocean close coast East Africa , equator . The climate tropical humid island two rainy season , March-June ( Masika ) October-December ( Vuli ) . Humidity high , 1000mm Masika rain . Economic activity mainly agriculture fish considerable improvement infrastructure - road electricity - make recent year . The island 's population total 460,196 2008 , 50 percent child age &lt; 15 year . Zanzibar autonomous part United Republic Tanzania mainland , 5 mortality rate ( U5MR ) 81 per 1,000 live birth substantially high Zanzibar 116 per 1,000 live birth . The area highly endemic soil transmit helminth - recent study neighbour Unguja Island find three-quarters rural inhabitant half urban inhabitant infect parasitic worm , despite 15 year mass drug treatment . Other risk factor concomitant anaemia poor nutrition , focal area Schistosoma haematobium transmission malaria , although recent control effort make impressive reduction malaria transmission ( reduced 0.8 % prevalence 2007 ) . Study school ( cluster ) : 12 government primary school across entire island identify trial , hookworm prevalence previous survey total &gt; 50 % : Mizingani , Ng'ombeni , Chambani , Uwandani , Bagamoyo , Shumba Viamboni , Mkanyageni , Ziwani , Wesha , Tumbe , Wingwi , Ngwachani . Study design : Pragmatic , cluster ( non-blinded ) randomise control trial school-aged child randomize either intervention ( pair shoe alongside standard care ) standard care ( periodic de-worming antihelminthics health education ) . Children already wear shoe advise continue control arm . Sample size : The study aim 80 % power 5 % significance , adjust cluster design , look 25 % reduction hookworm prevalence , 25 % reduction hookworm incidence 40 % reduction geometric mean residual hookworm infection intensity intervention arm , base survey data select school show &gt; 50 % prevalence hookworm infection 2010 . Using sample size calculation Stata 11.2 ( StataCorp , 2009 ) , adjust cluster design , study need enrol average 77 child 12 cluster ( n=924 , 462 arm ) , use correlation coefficient 0.01 . A great number cluster would preferable available resource limit study design 12 school . Inclusion criterion : Healthy school child randomly select ( stratified class sex ) 12 school select enrolment trial . Stratification take place follow : Class 1 school call boy girl divide two group . The child ask count ' 1 ' , ' 2 ' along line form either 1 2 ask file . The first 10 child group remain ( 10 girl 10 boy 20 child class ) give sample pot consent form take home parent . This repeat 5 primary school class 12 school . Exclusions : child whose parent consent participation child trial child life-threatening allergic reaction Albendazole . Baseline characteristic : collect enrol child attend school arm . A short questionnaire use collect information age , sex , housing characteristic measure wealth , sanitation home school , footwear use ( observed subjective ) , history recent illness , child last antihelminthic drug ( Schistosomiasis STHs ) bed net use . Parasitology : 1 stool sample child baseline ( July 2011 ) six month shoe distribution ( October 2012 ) examine Public Health Laboratory ( PHL ) , Pemba Island , use Kato-Katz method , measure prevalence soild transmit helminth ( STH ) STH infection intensity eggs/gram stool . To minimise hookworm egg loss , stool collect begin school day place coolbox wait transfer Pemba 's Public Health Laboratory process arrival . An average 10 percent sample slide re-checked quality control experience microscopist . Randomisation cluster : Simple randomisation use school enter Excel ( Microsoft , 2010 ) spreadsheet `` RAND '' function use assign random number 0 1 . The six low number assign intervention arm six high assign control arm baseline data gather . Given nature intervention , trial non-blinded . Data handling : Baseline data analyse use Stata 11.2 ( StataCorp , 2009 ) . Subsequent data analyse use SOFA Statistics Version 1.3.2 ( Paton-Simpson Associatiates Ltd , 2012 ) . Data contain identity number names store password-protected computer available prinicipal investigator , co-principal investigator study 's supervisor . Study registration detail ( identify child heavy hookworm load subsequent follow-up ) store Public Health Laboratory , Pemba island . Shoe distribution : Shoes distribute school ' pupil intervention arm ( ie monitor trial , approximately 6,500 pupil receive pair shoe ) ensure trial subject stand peer ; government sponsor de-worming healthcare education ( one stat dose Albendazole 400mg ) continue school ' pupil intervention control arm . Ethics approval : The study protocol approve Zanzibar Medical Research Ethics Committee ( ZAMREC ) MSc Ethics Committee London School Hygiene Tropical Medicine . Approval also seek grant Zanzibar 's Ministry Education presentation meeting ministry official school head teacher Public Health laboratory , Pemba Island . Consent : Consent form , provide detailed description trial plain language translate Swahili , distribute child eligible study ( see enrolment ) take home parent primary carers . It explain parent free remove child study time . A telephone number research team make available parent ( used several occasion ) case parent question concern . A child enrol study bring sign consent form stool sample . Safety monitor treatment : All child intervention control arm trial treat soil transmit helminths part Zanzibar government 's ongoing mass drug treatment programme . Both shoe Albendazole ( de-worming drug ) establish safety profile therefore monitor phase trial consider necessary . Children study find heavy hookworm infection ( &gt; 4,000 egg per gram stool ) treat paediatrician stat Mebendazole ( Vermox 100mg twice daily 3 day ) 10 day Ferrous gluconate syrup ( 10mls twice daily - dose 6-18 year-olds ) directly follow diagnosis .</detailed_description>
