	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study gallium Ga 68-edotreotide positron emission tomography ( PET ) /computed tomography ( CT ) compare indium In 111 pentetreotide plus contrast-enhanced CT ( MRI ) diagnose patient neuroendocrine tumor somatostatin receptor positive tumor . Diagnostic procedure , gallium Ga 68-edotreotide PET/CT , may help find diagnose somatostatin receptor positive neuroendocrine tumor . It yet know whether Ga 68-edotreotide PET/CT effective indium In 111 pentetreotide plus contrast-enhanced CT ( MRI ) diagnosis stag patient neuroendocrine tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gallium Ga 68-Edotreotide PET/CT Compared With Indium In 111 Pentetreotide Plus Contrast-Enhanced CT ( MRI ) Diagnosing Patients With Neuroendocrine Tumors Other Somatostatin Receptor Positive Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare efficacy [ 68Ga ] -DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide ( 68Ga-DOTATOC ) ( gallium Ga 68-edotreotide ) PET/CT Octreoscan ( indium In 111 pentetreotide ) + high-resolution , contrast-enhanced CT diagnosis stag patient somatostatin receptor express tumor . OUTLINE : Patients receive gallium Ga 68-edotreotide intravenously ( IV ) undergo PET/CT scan . Within 120 day , patient undergo standard indium In 111 pentetreotide contrast-enhanced CT MRI scan . Patients may also undergo second gallium Ga 68-edotreotide PET/CT scan within 3-6 month lesion first scan confirm .</detailed_description>
