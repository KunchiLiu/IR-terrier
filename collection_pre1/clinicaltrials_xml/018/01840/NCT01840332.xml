	<detailed_description>The treatment differentiate thyroid cancer ( DCT ) include surgery follow radioiodine treatment . In follow-up patient necessary induce TSH elevation measurement thyreoglobulin and/or total body scan . There two principal method obtain TSH elevation : 1 ) injection recombinant human TSH , 2 ) stop L-thyroxin replacement several ( 3-4 ) week . As use recombinant TSH rather expensive , method feasible many country . The problem stop L-thyroxin development severe hypothyroidism several week concomitant symptom sign . Current pilot study aim induce necessary TSH elevation decrease L-thyroxin dose . The main hypothesis necessary TSH stimulation achieve 4-6 week majority patient fix dose L-thyroxin . Concomitantly , blood test symptoms sign hypothyroidism obtain get information possible deviation treatment low dose thyroxin .</detailed_description>
