	<brief_summary>This study use pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) do 5 part . In Part A , successive participant cohort advance solid tumor receive pembrolizumab ass safety tolerability monotherapy . In Parts B , C , D , participant advance non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) receive pembrolizumab combination either cisplatin/pemetrexed carboplatin/pemetrexed ( Part B ) ; either carboplatin/paclitaxel carboplatin/nab-paclitaxel ( Part C ) ; ipilimumab ( Part D ) non-random assignment ass safety tolerability combination therapy . In Part E , participant untreated Extensive-disease ( ED ) Small Cell Lung Cancer ( SCLC ) receive pembrolizumab combination either cisplatin/etoposide carboplatin/etoposide non-random assignment ass safety tolerability combination therapy .</brief_summary>
