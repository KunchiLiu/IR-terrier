	<brief_summary>The overarch goal proposal 1 ) identify network brain region specifically activate personal smoking environment cue 2 ) evaluate effect exposure cue smoke self-administration subjective reactivity . The result study inform development novel efficacious cue-exposures therapy target help smoker quit smoke provide novel mechanism information regard influence environmental context drug taking . The investigator hypothesize cue-exposure treatment ( CETs ) , drug use prevent exposure drug cue ( e.g . lit cigarette ) limit efficacy part include cue representative context drug use occur . By demonstrate context cue differential robust influence brain behavioral response , provide substantial basis include stimuli context treatment . At time , identify novel mechanism stimuli promote continued drug use relapse .</brief_summary>
