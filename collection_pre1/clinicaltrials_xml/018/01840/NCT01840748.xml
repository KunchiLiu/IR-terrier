	<brief_summary>Systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) orphan , multiorgan disease affect connective tissue skin several internal organ . Pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) fatal disorder characterize increase pulmonary vascular resistance , lead right ventricular failure . Despite recently object great attention despite therapeutic advance , pulmonary hypertension due SSc remain associate dismal 47 - 67 % 3-year survival . Among SSc patient prospectively follow `` European League Against Rheumatism Scleroderma Trials Research '' ( EUSTAR ) cohort , 26 % death relate pulmonary hypertension . Although previous data suggest protective effect calcium channel blocker development pulmonary hypertension , potential preventive effect vasodilator prevention Pulmonary hypertension determine yet . In addition consider routinely treatment SSc-related pulmonary hypertension , prostanoids , endothelin receptor antagonist ( ETRA ) Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor ( PDE5i ) also use indication . This observational trial one five observational trial collaborative project `` To decipher optimal management systemic sclerosis '' ( DeSScipher ) . Aim observational trial : - compare outcomes adult juvenile SSc patient high risk develop pulmonary hypertension receive either different vasodilator treatment vasodilator treatment .</brief_summary>
