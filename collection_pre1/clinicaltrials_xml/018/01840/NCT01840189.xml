	<brief_summary>The conventional glucocorticoid replacement therapy primary adrenal insufficiency ( Addison 's disease ) render cortisol level unphysiological , may cause symptom long-term complication . The majority Addison 's patient organ-specific autoimmune disease , pose challenge replacement therapy . Of particular interest combination Addison ` disease type 1 diabetes , since cortisol affect glucose homeostasis . The clinical experience subgroup patient difficult treat , little research do understand improve situation . Glucocorticoid replacement technically feasible continuous subcutaneous hydrocortisone infusion , mimic normal diurnal cortisol rhythm . This pilot study aim evaluate continuous subcutaneous hydrocortisone infusion treatment term metabolic effect especially glycemic control patient combination Addison ` disease type 1 diabetes 5 month cross-over design open clinical pilot study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment Addison ` disease include glucocorticoid mineralocorticoid replacement . Despite optimized therapy steroid , many patient suffer impaired quality life increase mortality . The etiology premature death complicate may include combination inadequate treatment adrenal crisis , patient non-compliance , undetected hypoglycemia , addition associate increase cardiovascular , malignant , infectious disease death . The relative risk death patient Type 1 Diabetes 3.8 Sweden . Having Type 1 diabetes Addison ` disease significantly increase risk death compare adrenal insufficiency alone . The risk premature death patient combination Type 1 diabetes Addison ` disease extensively study appear contribute small portion increase mortality see patient Addison ` disease . Cortisol particularly potent effect blood glucose level , otherwise Addison ` disease affect production cortisol , important counterregulatory hormone hypoglycaemia . Lack cortisol might increase risk hypoglycemic episode , whereas over-replacement might cause hyperglycemia . Because steroid replacement may cause significant insulin resistance , challenge adjust insulin dos maintain optimal glycemic control . Little known effect unphysiological glucocorticoid replacement therapy glucose lipid metabolism , concern long-term metabolic consequence . Current glucocorticoid replacement result large fluctuation cortisol level directly influence glucose homeostasis , consequently , make accompany insulin treatment difficult manage . Different type , regimens dos glucocorticoid use adrenal insufficiency , none approximate physiological rhythm . Hydrocortisone administration via subcutaneous pump novel strategy restore circadian cortisol rhythm patient . The study open-labelled , cross-over design , comparison two glucocorticoid replacement modality glycemic event randomise order within patient , illustrated figure . Treatment A optimised oral hydrocortisone ( Cortef 5 mg ) replacement accord Mah et al , treatment B continuous subcutaneous hydrocortisone infusion therapy . The patient assign participation number randomise two treatment sequence ( A-B B-A ) . Should need extra glucocorticoid dose occur ( intercurrent illness , exercise ) study , safety reason , patient administer previous glucocorticoid insulin replacement . If dose insulin change , new test self-monitoring blood glucose continuous glucose monitor system do . The period dose adjustment insulin treatment glucocorticoid replacement modality take 2 week 6 week assessment glycemic control continuous glucose monitor system , follow minimal one month patient use previous glucocorticoid replacement previous insulin therapy ( wash-out period ) . Patients educate group , dose adjustment co-ordinated regular visit outpatient clinic/telephone consultation combine laboratory analysis . After principal study period participant offer 3 month ' continuous subcutaneous hydrocortisone infusion treatment extension period . Infusion gear Solu-Cortef 50mg/ml infusate refund study budget . Hydrocortisone infusion give Solu-Cortef Act-o-Vial 50mg/ml produced Pfizer . Pump design subcutaneous insulin infusion use subcutaneous administration . glucose level stable . Withdrawal criteria/Adverse Events The patient free withdraw time . If patient major difficulty manage infusion pump/equipment/continuous glucose monitor thorough education instruction , investigator consider withdrawal . In best interest patient , investigator sponsor decide withdraw patient study . Compliance patient check accord report remote control - Patients Diabetes Manager continuous glucose monitor . Unfortunately , available method follow compliance oral treatment . If patient develops condition meet exclusion criterion , patient withdrawn study . In case serious adverse event patient may withdraw study . Any adverse event register report Norwegian Swedish Medicines Agency . Any serious adverse event report within 15 day , case lethal life threaten event immediately . The patient report problem discomfort patient diary , need extra dos glucocorticoid also document . In addition , ask contact study group directly case problems/adverse event consultation . The study documentation research date store 15 year termination study . After termination study notify ethical committee 90 day final report prepare delivered ethical committee . If need terminate study earlier , notify ethical committee 15 day . Statistical consideration The study academic , investigator-driven pilot study , limited number expensive technique rare disease .</detailed_description>
