	<brief_summary>MUCIPLIQ nanopolymer engineer mimic glycosaminoglycans heparan sulfate . Glycosaminoglycans involve 1 ) stabilization cell micro-environment , know extracellular matrix , bind structural protein , 2 ) cell communication process protect growth factor . At site lesion , glycosaminoglycans degrade , thereby extracellular matrix disorganize tissue destroy . By replace damage glycosaminoglycans , MUCIPLIQ provide protection , restore matrix scaffold cell communication , process know Matrix Therapy . The purpose new control study determine whether MUCIPLIQ decrease incidence severity radio-chemotherapy-induced mucositis patient suffer upper aerodigestive tract cancer , use preventive agent . The study 's main hypothesis MUCIPLIQ mouthwash application radiotherapy would protect healthy oral tissue cytotoxic effect chemotherapy radiation .</brief_summary>
