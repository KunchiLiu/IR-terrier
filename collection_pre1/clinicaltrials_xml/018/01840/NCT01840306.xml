	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : ( ) To identify panel RNAs proteins predictive response HER2 target agent , consider clinical response . ( ii ) To investigate association presence vs. absence ( relative level ) identify extracellular ( EC ) RNAs/proteins patient ' clinicopathological characteristic , include age diagnosis , time progression overall survival , well correlation serum protein biomarkers routinely analyse patient . ( iii ) To compare HER2 positive sample versus HER2 negative sample existence RNAs/proteins identified ( ) ( ii ) . Secondary Objective : To develop predictive model use HER2 positive population base accurate sensitive combination identify biomarkers .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This translational pilot study , involve two patient cohort , design identify predictive biomarkers HER2 target therapy , validate large future study . Cohort 1 : 300 newly diagnose ( include metastatic ) HER2 positive breast cancer patient . Cohort 2 : 30 newly diagnose HER2 negative breast cancer patient . Blood specimens take : - start treatment ( cohort 1 2 ) - receive chemotherapy start HER2 target treatment ( applicable ) ( cohort 1 ) - within one month follow 1st treatment HER2 target treatment ( cohort 1 ) - approximately every 3 month ( coincide formal disease assessment ) HER2 target treatment maximum 5 year ( cohort 1 ) Blood process serum , analyse RNA protein biomarkers .</detailed_description>
