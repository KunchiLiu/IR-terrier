	<brief_summary>The development clinically relevant scalable exercise intervention older cystectomy patient may impact upon : - Patients : Exercise intervention may improve patient outcome , include quality life avoidance skilled nursing facility . - Clinicians : Proving safety feasibility target intervention old surgical patient may facilitate development clinically relevant preoperative intervention suitable wider study implementation . - Payers : Improved surgical outcome among high risk surgical patient associate significant cost saving . - Researchers : Targeted well controlled study focus improve surgical outcome exercise may provide insight relationship patient factor , surgical stressor outcomes . Ultimately , work may lead novel clinical approach optimize patient surgery . The investigator study effect preoperative exercise training cystectomy patient , specifically target increase functional capacity muscular strength . Prior conduct extensive , multi-center , randomized-controlled trial , feasibility , safety , initial efficacy preoperative exercise cystectomy patient must determine . To address issue , investigator complete trial rehabilitation cystectomy patient University Michigan .</brief_summary>
