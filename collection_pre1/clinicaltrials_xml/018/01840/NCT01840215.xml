	<brief_summary>Anaesthetic procedure ophthalmology surgery subject rapidly evolve past decade . When decide retrobulbar block , local injection vary mixture volumes fast-acting anesthetic ( lidocaine ) - without vasoconstrictive agent ( adrenaline ) - couple Hyaluronidase standard care provide painless surgery minimize possible risk increase intraocular pressure ( IOP ) , brainstem anesthesia , toxic reaction ocular blood flow change . These iatrogenic-induced vascular dysfunction also suggest play role intra-operatory vision loss ( `` wipe-out '' phenomenon ) patient advanced glaucoma . The rationale use epinephrine retrobulbar anesthesia slow absorption anesthetic general circulation thus achieve longer effect orbit . However , study ocular blood flow adrenaline-containing compound consistently show decrease ocular blood flow , thus raise issue whether used patient know vascular dysfunction , namely glaucoma patient . Nevertheless , study verify claim concern safety non-adrenaline containing anesthetic . Injecting pre-determined volume anesthetic compound behind globe , regardless formulation also debate . The orbital pressure increase lead number adverse reaction , increase IOP also potentially decrease vascular input local compression . In glaucoma instance , suggest optic nerve sheath less elastic healthy individual , potentially make structure le compliant outside compression . These rigid orbital tissue could also impair orbit 's ability deal iatrogenic increase volume . As see , current concept impact ocular anesthesiology orbit vascular supply eye limit small number non-homogeneous study . We aim study impact non-invasive , widely establish ultrasound base method ocular blood flow research ( color Doppler Imaging ) . Potentially , study could help determine taylor-made choice anesthesiology procedure apply specific patient , thereby advance current standard care ophthalmology .</brief_summary>
