	<brief_summary>The ULTRA study single-arm trial 100 premenopausal woman symptomatic uterine fibroid undergo treatment Acessa device . The Acessa device new FDA approve minimally invasive treatment uterine fibroid use radiofrequency energy destroy fibroid tissue . The fibroid shrink symptom significantly improve . The radiofrequency energy deliver fibroid outpatient surgical procedure . There minimal blood loss pain woman return usual activity 5-9 day Acessa procedure . The investigator evaluate change fibroid-related symptom Acessa treatment 3 , 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 month Acessa treatment . The investigator also assess operative outcome include procedure duration , complication , blood loss , post-operative pain , time return usual activity . The investigator determine long-term efficacy Acessa evaluate rate re-treatment symptomatic fibroid Acessa procedure .
