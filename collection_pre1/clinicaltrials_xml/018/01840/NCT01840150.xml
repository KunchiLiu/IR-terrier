	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study nanoscale artificial nose ( NA-NOSE ) monitoring response detect recurrence surgery radiation therapy patient stage I stage II non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Using NA-NOSE breath test may effective way monitor response detect recurrence NSCLC surgery radiation therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nanoscale Artificial Nose Monitoring Response Detecting Recurrence After Surgery Radiation Therapy Patients With Stage I Stage II Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine suitable fraction patient become NA-NOSE negative within three year post treatment . We test hypothesis fraction 30 % versus alternative least 50 % . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine patient become NA-NOSE negative post treatment become NA-NOSE positive prior clinical recurrence . II . Estimate time post treatment need become NA-NOSE negative . III . Estimate lead time gain negative positive NA-NOSE transition clinical recurrence . OUTLINE : Patients undergo breath sample collection NA-NOSE breath test baseline ( 2 pre-treatment sample ) , post treatment sample regularly schedule follow visit , 2 year absence disease progression .</detailed_description>
