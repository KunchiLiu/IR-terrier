	<brief_title>A Study Compare CAELYX With Topotecan HCL Patients With Recurrent Epithelial Ovarian Carcinoma Following Failure First-Line , Platinum-Based Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( people know identity intervention ) , randomize ( study medication assign chance ) , comparative bridging study ( supplemental study performs provide data effectiveness , safety , dosage compare two study medication new region ) . The study consist 3 phase : screening phase ( 30 day administration study medication ) , treatment phase , follow phase ( every 8 week tumor assessment disease progression death , study completion , whichever early every 3 month disease progression overall survival anti-tumor therapy minimum 1 year ) . In treatment phase , approximately 120 eligible participant categorize prospectively platinum-sensitivity ( sensitive versus refractory ) bulky disease ( presence versus absence ) . Later participant randomly assign either experimental arm ( CAELYX : administer Day 1 cycle ) control arm ( topotecan HCl : administer Day 1 Day 5 cycle ) . Treatment continue disease progression occur may continue least 2 cycle confirm complete response ( disappearance target lesion ) . On average , expect participant continue treatment approximately 3 6 cycle experimental arm ( CAELYX ) 4 8 cycle Control arm ( topotecan HCl ) . Safety evaluation include assessment adverse event , clinical laboratory test , electrocardiogram , echocardiogram ( multiple gate acquisition scan ) , vital sign , physical examination monitor throughout study . The total duration study approximately 23 month .</detailed_description>
