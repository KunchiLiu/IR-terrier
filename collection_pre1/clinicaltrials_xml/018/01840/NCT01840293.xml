	<detailed_description>This translational study . Patient undergo standard treatment tissue blood sample take various time point : Tissue : Fresh frozen ( FF ) Formalin fix paraffin embed tissue ( FFPE ) collect time surgery/biopsy primary recurrent/metastatic tumour tissue . Blood : Two type study blood ( non-heparinised Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) ) take pre-neoadjuvant treatment ( applicable ) , pre- post-operatively primary recurrent/ metastatic breast cancer ( recurrent/metastatic diagnosis biopsy/surgery require study blood take prior start treatment ) . Additional blood sample take annually follow-up visit 5 year primary case 2 year recurrent/metastatic case . Non-heparinised blood process serum . Clinical data collect time biological sampling .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients diagnose primary breast cancer attend hospital resection tumour tissue Or Patients suspect confirmed recurrent metastatic breast cancer ( Patient history biopsy surgically ( i.e . pathologically ) confirm primary breast cancer ) attend hospital resection/biopsy and/or treatment tumour tissue Or Patient suspect ( necessarily biopsy confirm ) newly diagnose stage 4 breast cancer attend hospital resection/biopsy and/or treatment tumour tissue 2 . Patients receive neoadjuvant treatment also eligible ( applicable ) 3 . Patients â‰¥ 18 year age 4 . Patients must able give informed consent</criteria>
