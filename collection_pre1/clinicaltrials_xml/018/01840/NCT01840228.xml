	<brief_summary>Preterm birth , define birth 37 week ' gestation , lead cause infant death disease . Progesterone single effective intervention prevention preterm birth . However , current use therapy limit certain high-risk group include woman history preterm birth woman short cervix . This study seek evaluate efficacy preventive therapy another high-risk group : woman arrest preterm labor . The investigator hypothesize administration vaginal progesterone woman present preterm labor remain undelivered 12 hour cessation short-term therapy inhibit contraction result low rate preterm birth 37 week ' administration placebo .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Vaginal Progesterone Prevention Preterm Birth Women With Arrested Preterm Labor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS The investigator perform randomize , blind , placebo-controlled trial evaluate use vaginal progesterone woman arrest preterm labor 24 week ' gestation reduce risk preterm birth 37 week ' gestation . Women enrol study randomized daily vaginal administration progesterone ( 200 mg ) placebo time enrollment 36 6/7 week ' gestation . Women eligible singleton twin gestation 24 0/7 33 6/7 week ' gestation initially present regular uterine contraction clinical diagnosis preterm labor remain undelivered without cervical change 12 hour discontinuation acute tocolytic therapy . Women may also participate less consider eligible discharge base attend physician judgement prior 12 hour period time . Randomization Blinding- Participants study randomize use computer-generated randomization scheme 1:1 allocation receive progesterone placebo . Investigators research team member , participant , obstetric provider blind allocate intervention . Procedures- - Data collection- Information record participant 's medical record . Additional study information include medical record obtain directly participant interview research team member . - Follow-up- Regardless whether participant remain hospitalized discharge prior delivery , meet study coordinator every 2 week . During follow-up visit , study team member discus compliance study drug possible side effect . The participant fill 1-page questionnaire ask question compliance side effect . This information record provide Data Safety Monitoring Board midpoint review . SAMPLE SIZE ESTIMATION The investigator plan enroll 120 patient , 1:1 allocation treatment placebo . This sample size adequate detect one-half reduction primary outcome , delivery 37 week . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Baseline characteristic woman randomize progesterone compare woman randomize placebo . Rates delivery 37 week ' gestation compare among group use Chi-square test . Secondary outcome evaluate use Chi-square test binary outcome Student t-test continuous outcome . Length time enrollment delivery analyze use Kaplan-Meier curve Cox proportional hazard model . All analysis perform use intention-to-treat principle .</detailed_description>
