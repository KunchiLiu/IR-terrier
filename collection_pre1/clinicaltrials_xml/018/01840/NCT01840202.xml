	<brief_summary>Glaucoma lead cause blindness worldwide , whose treatment - intraocular pressure lower - partially effective prevent disease progression . Accordingly , variable , ocular blood flow-related factor , implicated disease pathogenesis . However , finding involve vascular variable come partial , small-scale study . Furthermore , recent technological advance identify number ocular blood flow variable yet test large scale trial . Therefore , study specifically aim uncovering role vascular aspect glaucoma need . For purpose , cross-sectional , observational case-control study conduct University Hospitals Leuven . This largest-yet study subject , involve 750 patient . This allow creation specific cohort patient vascular aspect think particularly important ( low-tension glaucoma ) . It use large combination yet vascular-related measuring technique ( dynamic contour tonometry , optic coherent tomography , colour Doppler image retinal oximetry )</brief_summary>
