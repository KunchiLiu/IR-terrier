	<criteria>1 . Patients histologically confirm unresectable ( Stage III ) metastatic ( Stage IV ) malignant melanoma positive BRAF mutation result determine Roche CoDx local CLIAcertified analysis 2 . Patients naïve selective BRAF inhibitor therapy must progress therapy selective BRAF inhibitor . For patient enter protocol progress vemurafenib therapy , must tolerant 960 mg po bid dose . 3 . Tumor biopsy optional study except patient enter mandatory biopsy cohort . Nevertheless tumor biopsy encourage , especially patient accessible tumor biopsy include collection formalinfixed , paraffinembedded ( FFPE ) fresh frozen tissue ( FF ) outline biomarker section protocol . Willingness patient give consent biopsy , ascertain 4 . Patients ≥ 18 year age 5 . Patients Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 or1 6 . Patients measurable disease per 'Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ' ( RECIST version 1.1 ) 7 . Patients must normal organ adequate marrow function 8 . Patients ability swallow retain oral medication 9 . Women childbearing potential men willing agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry , duration study participation least 4 week withdrawal study , unless surgically sterilize . 10 . Negative serum pregnancy test within 10 day prior commencement therapy dose premenopausal woman . Women nonchildbearing potential may include either surgically sterile postmenopausal ≥1 year . 11 . Ability understand willingness offer write Informed Consent document prior screen procedure participation study For Extension phase For patient enter protocol progress vemurafenib therapy , must tolerant vemurafenib dose select extension phase 1 . Prior malignancy ( within last 2 year ) except adequately treat basal cell squamous cell skin cancer , situ cervical cancer , situ breast cancer , situ prostate cancer cancer patient diseasefree least 2 year 2 . Patients receive prior chemotherapy , radiotherapy , biologic/targeted anticancer therapy ( one week BRAF inhibitor melanoma ) surgery within 4 week ( 6 week monoclonal antibody , radioactive monoclonal antibody radioor toxinimmunoconjugates ) Day 1 Investigational product administration recover ( &lt; Grade 1 ) toxic effect prior therapy 3 . Patients receive investigational agent within 4 week prior Day 1 Investigational product administration recover completely ( &lt; Grade 1 ) side effect earlier investigational agent 4 . Anticipated administration anticancer therapy ( chemotherapy , radiation therapy , immunotherapy , biological therapy , hormonal therapy , surgery , and/or tumor embolisation ) administer study BRAF inhibitor 5 . Patients symptomatic untreated leptomeningeal brain metastasis , spinal cord compression [ patient previous brain metastasis allow enter trial metastasis surgically remove know site metastasis treat stereotactic high dose radiosurgery . Patients must corticosteroids least one month stable lesion verification imaging ( CT/MRI ) within 28 day prior Day 1 Investigational product administration ] 6 . Patients clinically significant medical condition malabsorption , inflammatory bowel disease , chronic diarrheal condition , refractory nausea , vomit condition interfere significantly absorption study drug 7 . Patients mean QTc interval &gt; 480 msec screen 8 . Treatment drug potential cause dysrhythmias include limited terfenadine , quinidine , procainamide , diisopyramide , sotalol , probucol , bepridil , haloperidol , risperidone and/or indapamide 9 . Patients warfarin treatment 10 . Any condition participation study judge Investigator detrimental patient ( ) intercurrent illness include , limited ongoing active infection , New York Heart Association functional classification class III , IV heart failure ; unstable angina pectoris ; cardiac arrhythmia ; history myocardial infarction ; uncontrolled hypertension ( blood pressure 160/100 mm Hg despite antihypertensive treatment ) ; coronary artery bypass graft ; cerebrovascular accident ; transient ischemic attack pulmonary embolism previous 6 month psychiatric illness/social situation would jeopardize compliance study requirement 11 . Patients know immediate delay hypersensitivity reaction idiosyncrasy medication chemically related P1446A05 vemurafenib , excipients consider clinically significant investigator 12 . Nursing woman 13 . Patients know HIV positivity AIDS relate illness , active Hepatitis B virus , active Hepatitis C virus 14 . Patients take drug know prolong QTc interval switch alternative drug . For Extension phase 1 . Patients active second malignancy eligible long need systemic therapy second malignancy 2 . Patients active brain metastasis include study long tumor size le 1 cm without requirement steroid use neurological symptom 3 . Patients evaluable metastatic disease allow even measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 . In case patient many sub centimeter intransit skin/SQ nodule eligible biopsy cohort .</criteria>
