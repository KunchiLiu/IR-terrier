	<brief_title>CO-OP Trial : Community-based Outreach Obesity Pregnancy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Phase 1 recruit 8-12 obese woman target population . Initially , 4-6 woman explore dietary guidance study intervention determine best tailor intervention . A repeat set structure interview conduct community-based modification provide assessment perceive efficacy intervention . Structured interview provide feedback dietary intervention include specific advice caloric recommendation pregnancy , level reassurance negative ketonuria urine specimen ( indicate diet supply nutrition necessary maintain healthy pregnancy ) , general level trust/interaction provider , maintain food diary , obesity issue directly affect lifestyles health . Phase 2 prospective randomize trial obese woman recruit first trimester . Study participant identify provider Truman Medical Center clinic population include obese pregnant woman le 16 week gestational age pregnancy . Dates confirmed standard practice include use last menstrual period obstetric ultrasound . Once potential woman identify directed study coordinator determine study eligibility ( BMI &gt; 30 , 16 week less pregnant , willing participate , singleton pregnancy , normal 1 hour glucola ) consent patient study . Women randomize usual care dietary intervention use opaque numbered envelope generate blinded statistician . The dietary intervention conduct registered dietician . Patients study arm receive detail intake specific dietary guideline . The dietary guideline study participant similar gestational diabetes include 18 24 kcal/kg diet 40 % carbohydrate , 30 % protein , 30 % fat . No participant give diet less 2,000 kcal per day . Recording daily food/beverage intake diary associate improved adherence dietary recommendation one effective intervention behavioral modification . Therefore , study participant ask record food/beverage diary bring prenatal visit . Recent evidence suggest highly dense acellular process food associate inflammatory state lead absorption lipid deposition fat.18,19 Study participant counsel limit intake highly calorie dense acellular process food beverages 1-2 time per week increase total percentage fruit vegetable 5-9 item per day . It expect woman may lose weight clinical trial 40 % woman lose weight similar trial8 . Although woman lose weight , instance starvation ketonuria routine screen difference infant birth weight two groups.8 Routine urinalysis perform pregnancy screen ketonuria indicate metabolic evidence starvation . Therefore , monitor safety study , routine urinalysis inspect evidence starvation ketonuria ( 2+ urine dip , 40mg/dl ) prompt investigation study staff cause determine whether related study protocol . No evidence maternal ketonuria document 200 woman previous study.8 Data safety monitoring conduct every 6 month medical monitor study , Michael Sheehan , MD ( neonatologist ) . The medical monitor specifically choose outside department ob/gyn allow objectivity . Adverse event would require immediate suspension study review would include maternal death , maternal ICU admission , total 2 perinatal death study group . Unanticipated adverse event report immediately Human Subjects Committee , recommendation temporary cessation continuation study follow . The natural frequency perinatal death Truman 16 week obese woman maximum 2 perinatal death 50 woman study group . If assume intervention well current standard practice maximum 2 perinatal death case serve rule study suspension review . If 4 perinatal death occur study conclude expect deviation . Women complete intake assessment include maternal height weight , food frequency quality life questionnaire repeat 3rd trimester 12 month postpartum . Missing data handle two separate way analysis . Numerical value miss weight , height , birth weight , etc . handle follow . Three separate attempt make locate data . For instance , patient deliver another hospital patient hospital contact 3 separate occasion obtain delivery record . Initially , miss data exclude analysis . Second , miss data impute last value report study participant ( maternal weight , height within 2 week ) average value group impute value ( ex : birth weight , maternal weight delivery ) feasible determine miss value alter analysis . Both method report .</detailed_description>
