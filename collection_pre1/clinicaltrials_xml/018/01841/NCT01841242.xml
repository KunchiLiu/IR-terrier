	<brief_summary>Heart Failure ( HF ) systolic dysfunction associate poor prognosis long term despite use many effective drug treatment reduce morbidity mortality . In context , cardiac resynchronization ( CR ) , either alone combined defibrillator function , improve 30 40 % morbidity mortality population patient heart failure . The information CR well establish patient stage III-IV NYHA ( New York Heart Association ) , systolic dysfunction ( EF ≤ 35 % ) , presence leave bundle branch block wide ( ≥ 120 m ) medical treatment optimal . As result , number implanted device continue grow even implant procedure cardiac resynchronization device ( CRD ) long , difficult associate significant complication risk reoperation estimate 10 15 % . One fear implantation device stimulation defibrillation risk represent risk infection lead inevitably explantation device . Despite use several preventive measure , include use antiseptic shower , local preparation alcoholic povidone iodine ( API ) ( PVPI 5 % ethanol + 70 % ) antibiotic prophylaxis clinical study recent clearly demonstrate risk infection associate duration intervention high procedure CR , note 2.4 % short term would close 3 4 % medium term . Infections implantable device associate poor prognosis , even excess mortality . It show majority infection may link local contamination surgery reinforce idea prevention mainly base local measure reduction operating time .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Alcoholic Chlorhexidine 2 % Versus Alcoholic Povidone Iodine Infections Prevention With Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Device Implantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In context , measure reduce risk infection , improve prognosis patient . Thus , recent study show great effectiveness local preparation alcoholic chlorhexidine ( applicator contain 2 % chlorhexidine 70 % alcohol isopropanolol ) ( AC 2 % ) compare aqueous povidone iodine ( API ) general surgery . It show rate local infection significantly reduce AC group vs 2 % . aqueous povidone iodine , respectively vs. 9.5 % . 16.1 % ( p = 0.004 ) . No randomized trial previously prospectively compare interest local preparation AC 2 % compare usual preparation API implantation Resynchronization device . Based experimental clinical study , hope new approach assess local skin preparation prevention general local risk infection implantation cardiac resynchronization device . To ensure consistency , high efficiency assume basis experimental clinical study , choice fell revenue 2 % applicator patient benefit primary location `` up-grading '' CR device .</detailed_description>
