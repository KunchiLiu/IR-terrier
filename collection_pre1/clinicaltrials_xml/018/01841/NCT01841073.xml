	<brief_summary>The rise prevalence type 2 diabetes related recent lifestyle change lead rise obesity . Obesity risk factor Impaired Glucose Tolerance ( IGT ) diabetes . A type fibre - fermentable carbohydrate - may help prevent diabetes individual IGT reduce appetite food intake , improve insulin sensitivity . Although fermentable carbohydrate absorb small intestine full ferment colonic bacteria . The fermentation carbohydrate produce short chain fatty acid act specific G protein couple receptor ( GPR41/43 ) intestine release GLP-1 PYY . GLP-1 PYY hormone act appetite centre brain decrease appetite . GLP-1 incretin effect possible effect beta cell increase insulin sensitivity . Short chain fatty acid also suppress release free fatty acid adipocytes . Lower level free fatty acid insulin resistant subject 's lead improve insulin sensitivity . This body work examine effect fermentable carbohydrate appetite , weight loss , blood glucose control give indication possibility fermentable carbohydrate prevent type 2 diabetes at-risk group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>TITLE The Effect Fermentable Carbohydrate Weight Management Glycaemic Control People High Risk Developing DMT2 AIMS To assess effect fermentable carbohydrate subject pre-diabetes : 1 . Appetite regulation 2 . Glucose homeostasis B-cell function 3 . Weight loss change body composition 4 . Weight loss maintenance 5 . Markers Oxidative Stress DESIGN The investigator plan conduct 3 investigation . Investigation 1 2 Randomised Crossover Control Trials 14 day supplementation 30g inulin ( fermentable carbohydrate ) cellulose ( non fermentable carbohydrate ) control firstly describe physiology mechanism behind appetite regulation glucose homeostasis . Investigation 3 Randomised Control Parallel Study weight loss follow weight maintenance ass efficacy fermentable carbohydrate decrease risk T2DM . POPULATION Overweight obese men woman pre-diabetes . TREATMENT Participants treatment arm 3 investigation consume inulin 3 time per day ( total daily dose : 30g ) . Participants placebo arm 3 investigation take cellulose 3 time day ( total daily dose : 30g ) . DURATION Investigation 1 last 16 week . Investigation 2 last 18 week . Investigation 3 last 18 week . BACKGROUND Type 2 Diabetes ( DMT2 ) major health concern UK , worldwide . The increased prevalence DMT2 UK closely link increased prevalence obesity , risk diabetes estimate increase 4.5-9 percent every kilogram weight gain ( 1 ) . Pre-diabetes also associate increase body weight , critical step development T2DM . Having pre-diabetes also increase risk cardiovascular disease . It think due hyperglycaemia glycaemic variability see pre-diabetic state . Both hyperglycaemia glycaemic variability associate oxidative stress . Oxidative stress postulate cause endothelial damage lead cardiovascular disease . Reductions hyperglycaemia glycaemic variability may cause reduction oxidative stress . A number gut hormone - release physiologically response food - show powerfully inhibit human appetite inhibit food intake glucose homeostasis ( 2 ) . Two gut hormone , glucagon like peptide-1 ( GLP-1 ) peptide YY ( PYY ) release neuroendocrine L-cell colon , demonstrable appetite suppressive effect animal human ( 3-6 ) . GLP-1 also improve glycaemic control stimulate pancreatic B-cells secrete insulin glucose-dependent manner , inhibit glucagon release reduce hepatic glucose output ( 7-9 ) . Long-term treatment GLP-1 agonists show cause significant weight loss human ( 10 ) . Work others rodent show dietary fermentable carbohydrate ( FCHOs ) significantly increase circulate PYY GLP-1 level suppress appetite centre hypothalamus ( 11-12 ) . This result low body fat abdominal fat overall effect weight ; however abdominal fat important cardiovascular risk factor diabetes , effect likely favourable health ( 13-14 ) . In human , number short-term study report increase satiety follow consumption FCHOs ( 15-16 ) year-long study child consume FCHO inulin show significant weight loss compare control ( 17 ) . FCHO also show increase insulin sensitivity , reduce post-prandial blood glucose level enhance lipid oxidation overweight subject without diabetes ( 18,19 ) , effect may mediate FCHO induced GLP-1 increase ( GLP-1 measured study ) . Even short-term consumption FCHO healthy subject similar effect glycaemic control ( 20 ) . STUDY DESIGN Inulin use FCHO supplement 3 investigation . Inulin known effect small bowel , fully ferment large bowel . Inulin therefore ideally suit investigation large bowel fermentation human appetite , glycaemic control weight maintenance . Test SCREENING PROCEDURE 1 . Telephone screen identify member cohort meet initial screen criterion : Adults 18 year age , Participants major metabolic disease - include diabetes , known/diagnosed gastrointestinal problem inflammatory bowel disease , irritable bowel syndrome etc drug alcohol abuse last 2 year . 2 . At Sir John McMichael Centre , participant undergo follow : An oral glucose tolerance test . A blood sample 30ml take full blood count , liver function test , electrolyte , thyroid function test , HbA1c , glucose . Body weight height record . DETAILED PROTOCOL APPETITE STUDY SESSIONS Visit 1 , 2 , 3 &amp; 4 Investigation 1 . Participants arrive fast overnight ( 10 hour fast ) . After explanation procedure confirmation participant happy proceed , body weight record . A cannula insert forearm vein facilitate blood sample throughout day . Two baseline blood sample withdraw . Visual analogue scale ( VAS ) complete every time blood sample drawn . The sample scheme present . A total 80ml blood take investigation 1 appetite study day , total 115ml withdrawn appetite study visit investigation 3 . Visual Analogue scale assess appetite complete time blood sample take . The Visual Analogue Scale question include : `` How full feel right ? '' `` How hungry feel right ? '' `` How much could eat right ? '' . They answer make vertical mark ten centimetre line anchor term `` '' `` extremely '' . Similarly , side-effects nausea , sickness , flatulence , bloating , diarrhoea , general well-being assess . At time 0 , breakfast serve participant 20 minute consume meal . Lunch serve 240 minute , meal test serve 440 minute last blood sample take . During study session , participant ask minimize physical activity . Water allow freely , though participant request drink less 10 minute prior blood sample VAS completion . At 440 minute , pre-weighed meal serve . The meal serve excess participant ask eat comfortably full . A jug water serve meal water intake also record . In investigation 3 , study session shorter , consist breakfast meal test lunch . ONE TO ONE DIETARY COUNSELLING In Investigation 3 , participant receive dietary counselling week 1 , 2 , 4 , 7 . The instruction give participant individualise base current weight energy requirement , consistent usual package care would offer within dietitian clinic . The participant instruct aim 5 % weight loss 9 week . SUPPLEMENTATION UNDER FREE-LIVING CONDITIONS The supplement provide sachet ( contain 10g portion ) . During run-in period daily intake gradually increased 30g per day 4 week . During run-in period investigator contact participant via e-mail telephone twice ensure fibre supplementation un-toward side-effects ensure instruction follow answer question participant may . The subject take 30g day end study ( 6 week investigation 1 18 week investigation 3 ) . WASHOUT PERIOD In investigation 1 2 wash period 4 week subject cross alternate supplementation . DIETARY RECORDS , APPETITE AND SIDE-EFFECTS A 3-day dietary record complete 3 day precede visit 1 , 2 3 Investigation 1 , visit 1 , 6 7 Investigation 3 . On day , appetite sensation side-effects assess use visual analogue scale . The Visual Analogue Scale question include : `` How full feel eat meal today ? '' `` How hungry feel meal today ? '' . They answer make vertical mark ten centimetre line anchor term `` '' `` extremely '' . Similarly , side-effects nausea , sickness , flatulence , bloating , diarrhoea , general well-being assess . METHODS FOR ASSESSING INSULIN AND GLUCOSE HOMOSTASIS MEAL TOLERANCE TEST Participant attend clinical investigation unit 12 hour fast . A cannula place forearm . Three fast blood sample take ( -30 , -15 0 ) . A standard test meal one Kellogg 's breakfast bar Ensure Plus give . Blood take 0 , 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 150 , 180 amd 240 min . This used calculate Glucose profile , basal insulin response , dynamic phase insulin , static phase insulin sensitivity , DI=Dynamic phase insulin X Static phase insulin , GIP GLP-1 response . Free living glucose monitoring : Medtronic iPro Continuous Glucose Monitor use assess 5-day continuous glucose monitoring . 5-day continuous glucose monitoring ass `` free living '' glucose homeostasis . This interstitial fluid glucose data analyse mean glucose glycaemic variability measure include Mean Amplitude Glycaemic Excursions ( MAGE ) , Continuous Overlapping Net Glycaemic Action ( CONGA ) risk index Low Blood Glucose Index ( LBGI ) , High Blood Glucose Index ( HBGI ) average daily risk ratio ( ADRR ) .
