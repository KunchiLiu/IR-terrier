	<detailed_description>Retro peritoneal liposarcoma rare ( le 15 % sarcoma ) whose prognosis locoregional . In treatment retroperitoneal liposarcoma main prognostic factor quality surgical resection . The effect radiotherapy combine surgery uncertain limit perhaps limited prescribed dos ( order 45Gy 50Gy ) due high risk organ toxicity nearby . Two element overcome difficulty : - Preoperative radiotherapy make rather Postoperatively , tumor place back gastrointestinal tract reduce toxicity , - The contribution conformal radiotherapy technique intensity modulation ( IMRT ) . The helical tomotherapy innovative equipment radiotherapy make conformational radiotherapy modulation intensity particularly suitable irradiation precision ( image mode associate daily scanner ) large complex volume . Increasing dos ( increase prescribe dose 54 Gy , thus potentially curative ) , helical tomotherapy allow improve efficacy radiotherapy .</detailed_description>
