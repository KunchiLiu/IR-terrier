Second , two adhesive disc place skin , one umbilicus one right inner thigh . The disc leave place 30 second remove . Third , two area skin , one right side abdomen umbilicus inner right thigh , gently swab sterile cotton swab ( one location ) . The intent remove thin layer oil/lipid skin upon removal paper adhesive disc swab without disrupt skin surface ( similar take fingerprint ) . Blood specimen obtain three time , time 1 ml : enrollment , 2 week last one 4 week age , generate plasma lipoprotein profile size distribution ( HDL , LDL , VLDL , total cholesterol ) . For infant feed express human milk , also obtain sample mother 's milk analysis lipid profile ( 2 ml ) .</detailed_description>
