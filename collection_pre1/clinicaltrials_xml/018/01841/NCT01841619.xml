	<brief_title>IVIg Efficacy Study Treat Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The ultimate goal pilot project generate proof-of-concept data show treatment intravenous immunoglobulin ( IVIg ) replace current systemic immunosuppressive therapy cutaneous lupus erythematosis ( CLE ) patient . This project relevant clinical implication due severe side effect lack response current therapy . From review literature , postulate : 1. beneficial effect IVIg patient CLE prompt , mark improvement within week ; 2. clinical improvement last several week last infusion ; 3. remission may prolong maintenance IVIg therapy . Although non-controlled study , investigator expect IVIg improve CLE , include resistant standard treatment . It anticipate treatment IVIg facilitate heal extensive cutaneous lesion achieve rapid remission . Maintenance therapy repeat monthly pulse IVIg expect keep disease remission treatment-free follow observational period . The result provide basis multicenter randomize control study identify CLE subsets benefit protocol provide optimal clinical outcome .</detailed_description>
