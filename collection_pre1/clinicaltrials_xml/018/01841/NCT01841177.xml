	<brief_summary>Children congenital heart disease significant morbidity include low cardiac output syndrome subsequent organ dysfunction may prevent optimization circulatory function . More half child receive milrinone . Clinical evaluation distinguish patient sub-therapeutic , therapeutic , toxic milrinone drug level . Consequently child require pharmacologic circulatory support may receive sub-optimal dosing , child need milrinone may receive milrinone unnecessarily . The primary objective study determine optimize milrinone level therapeutic drug monitoring critically ill child follow cardiac surgery improve clinical outcome reduce duration milrinone infusion . This study hypothesize optimize milrinone level therapeutic drug monitoring critically ill child follow cardiac surgery improve clinical outcome reduce duration milrinone infusion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Precision Therapy - Milrinone</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose trial pilot open label , randomize trial milrinone therapeutic drug monitoring patient &lt; 18 year treat milrinone follow open-heart surgery congenital heart disease Hospital Sick Children , Toronto . We randomize patient ( 1 ) receive therapeutic drug monitoring ( 2 ) control patient receive standard care . Standard care involve titration milrinone infusion base clinical examination treat team . Control patient milrinone plasma level draw analysed end study . The intervention ( 1 ) regular measurement milrinone level ; ( 2 ) physician feedback plasma level experimental arm ICU pharmacist . After obtain consent , eligible subject allocate trial group random assignment ( sealed envelope ) within 3 stratum 1:1 allocation . These stratum &lt; 2 year , 2- 10 year &gt; 10 year ensure equal distribution age range group pharmacokinetic analysis . For intervention group , sample milrinone level occur 0 hour ( upon arrival ICU routine admission blood collection ) approximately every 6- 8 hour ( whenever line access routine blood work ) . The last sample take 6-8 hour cessation infusion , patient leaf ICU , maximum amount blood sample reach 7 day child weigh 8 kg ( 5 day child weigh less 8 kg ) , ever come first . Follow-up exclusively period hospitalization ICU ICU discharge . An optional algorithm propose titration milrinone provide use discretion treat team . Clinical outcome measure composite outcome dysrhythmia , LCOS death .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Admitted Pediatric ( 0 18 year ) Intensive Care Unit follow cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) surgery congenital heart disease . Clinical decision treat team start milrinone infusion . Anticipated receive milrinone infusion 24hs . This limit increase proportion sicker child sample , increase power study . Has arterial line , central venous line define radiologically confirm line Informed consent obtain Premature infant ( &lt; 36 week postconceptual age ) weight less 2.0 kg .
