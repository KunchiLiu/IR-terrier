	<detailed_description>HCV infect patient often need antidepressant . Inadequate treatment depression HCV treatment negative effect adherence HCV treatment , suboptimal response potential result . The introduction Direct Acting Antivirals telaprevir greatly improve treatment outcome HCV infect patient . Telaprevir , however , cause significant drug-drug interaction hence co-administration medication preferably do base clinical evidence combination safe . Telaprevir study one antidepressant , escitalopram : plasma concentration antidepressant reduce 35 % without dose adjustment may lead inadequate treatment depressive symptom . Dose titration escitalopram may need may take several week patient reach therapeutic dose . There need data telaprevir drug interaction antidepressant . First , data show negative interaction occur escitalopram dose-titration antidepressant may take long prevent ( re- ) occurrence depressive symptom . Second , patient benefit escitalopram ( prior ) treatment failure escitalopram may require alternative agent . Third , although escitalopram generally well-tolerated , side effect may occur necessitate treatment discontinuation . Finally , especially previous intravenous drug user methadone , escitalopram might antidepressant choice , since escitalopram well methadone drug lead QTc interval prolongation risk Torsades de Pointes . For number reason , paroxetine may good candidate use together telaprevir-containing HCV treatment . First , paroxetine show prevent depressive symptom patient initiate HCV treatment elevate depressive symptom baseline . Second , paroxetine inhibitor metabolize CYP2D6 telaprevir inhibitor metabolize CYP3A , therefore drug-drug interaction expect . Third , paroxetine one widely prescribed antidepressant well-established efficacy safety profile .</detailed_description>
