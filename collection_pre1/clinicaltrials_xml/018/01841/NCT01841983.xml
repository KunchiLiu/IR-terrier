	<brief_summary>While research integrate approach occupational health safety worksite health promotion date focus manufacturing setting , employment shift service sector . Within sector , health care employ 12 million worker , second fast grow industry U.S. economy . In contrast worker industry , rate occupational injury illnesses among health care worker increase past decade . The purpose study lay foundation integrate intervention health care examination association worker health outcome risk job work policy practice address prevalent issue musculoskeletal disorder ( MSDs ) , particularly low back pain disability ( LBPD ) , health promotion physical activity among patient care worker . The specific aim study : 1 . To estimate efficacy determine feasibility integrate intervention , address health protection health promotion order reduce MSD symptom improve health behavior among healthcare worker . We assess between-group difference MSD symptom , health behavior , include physical activity , set secondary outcome , include unplanned absence , report injury , worker compensation claim cost , turnover retention , intention leave job , work-role function . This study explore work hypothesis : Workers employ baseline patient-care unit receive intervention report great reduction MSD symptom ( primary outcome ) great improvement health behavior , compare worker employed baseline unit assign Usual Care control group . 2 . To determine factor work environment contribute time reduction MSD symptom improvement safe healthy behavior . ( 1 ) The work environment , work organization , psychosocial factor , measure current study , associate change worker ' health behavior health outcome assessments current proposed study ; ( 2 ) Improvements work environment time associate improvement worker ' health behavior health outcome . We conduct multilevel modeling analysis evaluate simultaneous effect worker-level unit-level factor MSD symptom safety health behavior .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Improving protect health well-being healthcare worker require address key risk work environment well promote safe healthy behavior . Healthcare worker elevate risk musculoskeletal disorder ( MSDs ) due range job factor , include lift transferring patient ; work long hour ( often night ) ; limit control decision job . Among , nurse nurse aide bear large burden injury . Back injuries particular constitute great source disability . These risk likely increase come year due age nursing workforce , increase work demand , labor shortage . Health behavior , include physical activity , inadequate sleep , dietary pattern associate overweight obese , also influence work environment psychosocial factor job , also associate MSD risk . Traditional approach redress risk focus separately health protection , include effort reduce MSD risk , health promotion aim improve health behavior . Little research systematically examine dual potentially synergistic effect work environment risk MSDs worker health behavior , insufficient evidence determine efficacious way ameliorate combine effect health risk . Our long-term goal improve overall health well-being healthcare worker make available evidence-based worksite policy , program , practice foster healthy work environment , reduce potential hazardous job exposure , promote safe healthy behavior . The propose study next logical step build evidence base . Factors work environment , include high work demand , low social support , long work hour , show increase risk MSDs , well risk-related behavior . Yet little research systematically explore cross-cutting pathway implication improve effectiveness worksite intervention address broad spectrum worker health outcome . The propose research provide novel approach worksite intervention integrate occupational safety health worksite health promotion , take account share factor work environment shape MSDs health behavior . Standard approach occupational health safety worksite health promotion base parallel structure separate silo function relatively independently worksite , draw discipline train experience within public health . Although parallel effort share common mission improve worker health , strategy base different assumption approach improve worker health outcome . The propose research integrate parallel approach . Although prior research rigorously test efficacy integrate intervention model change worker health behavior , knowledge prior research examine impact integrate model health outcome associate work exposure - , notably , MSD symptom .</detailed_description>
