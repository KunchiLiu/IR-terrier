	<brief_summary>The rationale study ( IPV 002ABMG ) evaluate compare three dos IPV , two dos IPV plus one bOPV , one dose IPV plus two dos bOPV order provide evidence good immunization policy make region world must switch use IPV/bOPV schedule 2014-2015 time frame . The goal identify best option optimize humoral immune response , intestinal immunity thereby prevent community transmission well prevent VAPP . Specifically , study seek show sequential regimen equivalent ( not-inferior ) 3-dose IPV regimen seroconversion rate type 1 type 3 poliovirus 10 % subject fall 95 % confidence interval observe 3-dose IPV alone regimen geometric mean titer ( GMTs ) 2/3 log less 3-dose IPV regimen . In addition , study evaluate novel method ( poliovirus shed index ) , adequacy IPV vaccine induce intestinal immunity , specifically reduce shed poliovirus type 2 OPV challenge . The hypothesis study : - A 3-dose IPV/bOPV sequential schedule include 1 2 dos bOPV non-inferior term type 1 3 seroconversion rate GMTs 3-dose IPV schedule . - Two possibly 1 IPV dose ( ) provide significant seroconversion rate GMTs type 2 poliovirus sufficient priming induce rapid immune response context oral challenge 7 month age . - Three , 2 , possibly 1 dose IPV induce intestinal immunity poliovirus type 2 measure combination quantity virus stool duration shed ( shed index ) . In addition 3 hypothesis , study explore following hypothesis : • Co-administration bOPV rotavirus 16 week age ( second rotavirus dose ) provide similar antirotavirus IgA seroconversion rate GMCs compare subject receive rotavirus vaccine together IPV .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>3.0 STUDY DESIGN This multicenter , randomize , unblinded study . Healthy infant attend well-child care outpatient clinic due first dose polio vaccine eligible study . Infants 8 wks ± 7 day age randomize allocate three treatment group . 4.0 STUDY POPULATION The study conduct 7 `` vacunatorios '' Chile . Parents legal guardian healthy infant , receive well-child care designate outpatient clinic , approach participate study . 5.0 TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 5.1 Vaccines The vaccine use study include bOPV , mOPV2 , IPV ( see Section 14.2 package insert ) . 5.1.1 Bivalent Oral Polio Vaccine ( bOPV ) Produced Sanofi Pasteur , Lyon , France , bivalent OPV vaccine contain type 1 3 poliovirus indicate supplementary immunization activity child 0 5 year age prevent contain outbreak cause 2 serotypes . The vaccine contain least 6.0 log CCID50 LS c2ab live attenuate polio virus type 1 ; least 5.8 log CCID50 Leon I2aIb strain polio virus type 3 . The vaccine dose 2 drop ( 0.1 mL ) use multi-dose dropper vial , give directly mouth . The vaccine store freezer -20°C , thaw store 6 month refrigerate temperature +2 +8°C . 5.1.2 Monovalent Oral Polio Vaccine Type 2 ( mOPV2 ) Monovalent OPV type 2 live attenuate poliomyelitis virus vaccine ( mOPV2 ) produce Glaxo SmithKline , Rixensart , Belgium , sterile suspension poliovirus serotype 2 oral administration . Each dose ( 0.1 mL ) contain less 105.0 CCID50 Sabin strain type 2 ( P 712 , Ch , 2ab ) . This challenge OPV strain use assess intestinal shed immunity . The vaccine store freezer -20°C , thaw store 6 month refrigerate temperature +2 +8°C . 5.1.3 Inactivated Polio Vaccine ( IPV ) Inactivated poliovirus vaccine produce Sanofi-Pasteur sterile suspension 3 type poliovirus . Each dose vaccine ( 0.5 mL ) contain 40 D antigen unit Mahoney strain ( Type 1 ) ; 8 D antigen unit MEF-1 strain ( Type 2 ) ; 32 D antigen unit Saukett strain ( Type 3 ) . It also contain 0.5 % 2-phenoxyethanol maximum 0.02 % formaldehyde preservative . It may also contain 5 ng neomycin , 200 ng streptomycin , 25 ng polymixin B residual vaccine production . The vaccine contain Thimerosal . The vaccine keep refrigerated +2 +8°C , never freeze . The dose IPV vaccine 0.5 mL administer intramuscularly anterolateral aspect thigh . 5.2 Vaccine Intervals Administration All polio vaccine dos administer least 4 week apart . For IPV , administration site restrict anterolateral aspect leave thigh . - All intramuscular ( IM ) EPI routine vaccine administer anterolateral aspect right thigh ( arm 16 week 3 vaccine administer include IPV , pentavalent combination vaccine , S. pneumoniae ) . These vaccine inject gluteal area area may major nerve damage . - IPV administer IM Week 8 ( Group 1 ) , Weeks 8 16 ( Group 2 ) , Weeks 8 , 16 , 24 ( Group 3 ) . - Bivalent OPV administer oral drop ( 2 drop vaccination ) Weeks 16 24 ( Group 1 ) Week 24 ( Group 2 ) . - An oral challenge dose ( 2 drop ) mOPV2 administer Week 28 . Prior injection vaccine , know precaution take prevent adverse reaction . This include review potential participant 's history respect possible allergic reaction vaccine similar vaccine . Epinephrine Injection ( 1:1000 ) appropriate agent available control immediate allergic reaction . Health-care provider obtain previous immunization history subject , inquire current health status subject . Infants participate study provide recommended vaccine aside polio vaccine per National Immunization Schedule Chile ( DTPw/HBV/Hib , S. pneumoniae vaccine ) . In addition , 2-dose ( RotarixTM ) oral rotavirus vaccine offer study 8 week 16 week age . Serology Testing Rational blood sample : After thorough discussion minimum number serum sample require obtain valid answer hypothesis , research group arrive follow : 1 . Baseline serum sample 7-8 week determine antibody titer poliovirus ( rotavirus ) vaccination , require basis detect seroconversion rate . 2 . Post IPV dose 1 16 week ( Group 1 ) IPV 2 24 week ( Groups 2 3 ) determine IPV/bOPV dose-dependent seroconversions poliovirus 2 short possible latency vaccination avoid potential confounder associate exposure circulate poliovirus 2 vaccine virus . 3 . Post 3 dos measure primary objective , seroconversion GMTs type 1 3 different schedule . This serum also use antirotavirus antibody determination order calculate seroconversion rate GMCs achieve . 4 . One week post-type 2 live poliovirus vaccine challenge 28 week determine infant seroconverted type 2 poliovirus complete series 3 immunization 8 , 16 , 24 week 3 group , rapidly within 1 week challenge . Seroconversion within 1 week strongly suggest although individual seroconverted prior mOPV2 challenge , would rapidly encounter cVDPV2 environment ; turn suggest although might become infected cVDPV2 , risk develop neuroparalytic disease consequence would nonetheless substantially reduce . A total 4 blood sample collect study subject . A maximum 3 mL obtain heel stick venipuncture method . Each blood sample transport within 24 hour appropriate cold chain condition `` Central Study Laboratory '' Microbiology Mycology Program , Institute Biomedical Sciences , Faculty Medicine , University Chile . Sera obtain 2 aliquot place cryovials , label link coding , store -20°C freezer . One aliquot ship appropriate cold chain condition Polio Picornavirus Laboratory Branch , Center Disease Control Prevention . The second aliquot leave repository storage study center . Sera process follow standard protocol ( see Section 14.1 ) . Neutralizing antibody polioviruses 1 , 2 , 3 determine use sero-neutralization assay . The laboratory blind regard vaccination status individual contribute particular specimen , ensure integrity study . After successful completion testing , duplicate specimen destroy . Authorized specimen assay antibody level valence include study vaccine . Should case arise , use specimen assay require approval study Sponsor Principal Investigator , well Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC ) approval , per applicable rule regulation . Baseline serum serum obtain 28 week process antirotavirus IgA concentration previously describe Glaxo SmithKline laboratory ( 26 ) . 5.3 Stool Samples Poliovirus `` Shedding Index '' determination Stool sample ( 5 10 gram ) collect 5 time subject , use WHO approve protocol kit , transport store follow WHO procedures detection poliovirus . Fresh stool collect unmixed urine screw-top container , place cold box frozen ice pack , transport designated laboratory storage freezer -20°C . A log book collect stored sample keep study personnel . Stool sample use later determine excretion poliovirus per protocol ( Section 14.1 ) . Samples send batch reference laboratory poliovirus culture . 5.4 Medications/Treatments Permitted ( include rescue medication ) Permitted Before and/or During Trial There restriction use medications/treatments except follow condition : primary immune deficiency immune deficiency subsequent treatment , leukemia , lymphoma advance malignancy subject vaccinate his/her close contact . Only medication treat SAEs IMEs document eCRF . All medication capture record source document investigator discretion investigational site . 5.5 Subject Compliance Subjects require abide schedule visit vaccine schedule .</detailed_description>
