	<brief_summary>Surgical resection best treatment option colorectal cancer . Despite radical approach , recurrence within five year still common . Several author propose immunosuppressive state surround perioperative period key element cancer cell spread . A particular subtype T lymphocytes , Natural Killer cell ( NKs ) , main actor innate immune system . Several factor perioperative period reduce activity NKs stress , pain , opioids general anaesthetic . Lidocaine local anaesthetic widely use intravenously abdominal surgery . Intravenous lidocaine show reduce pain score , morphine consumption , ileus time length stay major colorectal surgery . It reduce marker systemic inflammation well . The author hypothesize use intravenous lidocaine laparoscopic surgery colorectal cancer resection preserve NKs activity .</brief_summary>
