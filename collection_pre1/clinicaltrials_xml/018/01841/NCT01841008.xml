	<brief_summary>Tacrolimus ointment 0.1 % show promising result treat vitiligo many prospective study . Prospective randomized study versus placebo require confirm hypothesis maintenance treatment two application tacrolimus ointment 0.1 % per week reduce relapse non-segmental vitiligo lesion . Main objective To assess efficacy maintenance therapy topical tacrolimus v placebo prevention depigmentation patient vitiligo responded treatment . Secondary objective - Evaluate efficacy maintenance therapy tacrolimus vs topical placebo decrease intensity depigmentation patient vitiligo responded treatment . - To study occurrence possible adverse effect . Length study Inclusion : 12 month Treatment : 6 month Follow-up : 6 month Total length study : 18 month Intervention Multicentric prospective interventional randomize comparative study versus placebo . - Visit V0 : Selection Information patient , control inclusion non inclusion criterion . - Visit V1 : Control inclusion non inclusion criterion , patient sign informed consent . An initial clinical evaluation photograph direct sunlight UV . Topical treatment ( tacrolimus placebo ) deliver patient hospital pharmacy apply twice per week ( 3 4 day apart ) 24 week . - Visit V2 : The patient review end treatment ( 24 week visit V1 ) final evaluation . A clinical assessment make photographs way inclusion . Adverse reaction treatment collect investigator ( noted patient notebook present baseline ) . The percentage depigmentation evaluate blinded treatment photograph two reviewer . In case disagreement , opinion third appraiser require . - End study : After end study patient support via usual care recommend condition . Evaluation criterion - primary endpoint -- -Percentage patient 24 week without depigmentation ( depigmentation score = 0 ) . A score depigmentation 0 2 use . A blind treatment evaluation direct light UV photograph make two independent observer ( dermatologist ) inclusion 24 week treatment . - secondary endpoint -- -- The efficiency reduce intensity relapse evaluate use score depigmentation ( rate patient score 0 1 group ) VASI score ( Appendix 4 ) . - The frequency , severity time occurrence adverse event report . Side effect classify grade accord WHO criterion . Number subject Considering depigmentation occur 40 % patient 24 week maintenance treatment hop proactive treatment reduce rate depigmentation 10 % , population 26 patient per group necessary ( take account 10 % patient lose follow ) . The total number patient include study 52 .</brief_summary>
