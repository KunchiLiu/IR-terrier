	<brief_summary>People originate Indian subcontinent know South Asians fast grow group non-white Canadians . They suffer excess prevalence abdominal obesity , type 2 diabetes heart disease . They also develop risk factor significantly low body weight young age compare people European origin . The purpose SAHARA ( South Asian HeArt Risk Assessment ) Trial , recruit 330 South Asians Ontario ( Principal Investigator : Dr. Sonia Anand ) British Columbia ( Co-investigator : Dr. Scott Lear ) , use internet , email multimedia device . Among participant , investigator compare effectiveness 12-month interactive multi-media health behaviour intervention usual care reduce cardiac risk factor . This intervention enable participant set health goal provide health message feedback design improve smoking , dietary habit physical activity . In addition , investigator test knowledge genetic risk heart attack influence behaviour change heart health risk factor profile . The information generate SAHARA enable individual , physician , health professional , policy maker develop risk factor modification program prevent cardiovascular disease high-risk group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction : Coronary heart disease ( CHD ) remain major cause disease burden globally , rise prevalence obesity adult onset diabetes predict potentiate CHD epidemic develop country , high risk population , include people originate Indian subcontinent ( South Asians ) . More 1.2 million people South Asian origin live Canada fast grow group non-white Canadians . Our previous work among South Asians show , compare white Caucasians Canada , suffer 2.5 time excess prevalence elevate glucose ( dysglycemia ) , CHD . They also develop abnormal glucose , lipid ( elevate apolipoprotein B &amp; reduce apolipoprotein Al ) blood pressure significantly low body mass index value compare white Caucasians ( 21 vs. 30 ) . Successful intervention prevent improve myocardial infarction ( MI ) risk factor among South Asians urgently need . Objectives : Among South Asian men woman ≥ 30 year live Canada propose : 1 . To test effectiveness culturally-tailored multimedia intervention design improve health behaviour include dietary habit , sedentary behaviour , physical activity , tobacco use , order improve MI risk factor profile . 2 . To test knowledge genetic risk MI determine 9p21 variant genotype influence behaviour change MI risk factor profile . 3 . To determine change MI risk score clinical event include MI , death , development new diabetes , development new hypertension 6 month follow-up . Design &amp; Methods : People South Asian ancestry define people whose ancestor originate Indian subcontinent ( India , Pakistan , Bangladesh Sri Lanka ) ≥ 30 year age eligible SAHARA . Subjects access e-mail , text message smart phone suffer previous coronary heart disease exclude . 330 subject undergo brief cardiac risk factor assessment include collection data questionnaire , physical measurement ( i.e . weight , height , waist hip circumference , blood pressure ) , blood sample collect measure apolipoproteins glucose . All eligible consenting subject randomize 1:1 intervention versus control . The intervention group include goal setting , self monitor participant receive regular health message use electronic medium regard smoking , dietary habit &amp; physical activity . The control group receive usual advice regular health messaging . The intervention last 12 month randomization effectiveness intervention evaluate use change cardiac risk score 12 month . Summary : South Asians fast grow group Canadians . They suffer excess prevalence cardiac risk factor MI young age compare people European origin . The SAHARA project enable u use simple validated tool assess MI risk profile among South Asian men woman Ontario British Columbia , test culturally-tailored multimedia intervention determine improvement MI risk factor profile achieve sustain . If intervention successful easily scalable , potential deliver large proportion South Asian community Canada .</detailed_description>
