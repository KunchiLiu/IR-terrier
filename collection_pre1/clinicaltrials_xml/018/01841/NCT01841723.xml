	<brief_title>Ibrutinib Treating Patients With Relapsed Hairy Cell Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine overall response rate ( complete response [ CR ] partial response [ PR ] ) hairy cell leukemia ( HCL ) 32 week begin therapy single-agent ibrutinib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize toxicity tolerability single-agent ibrutinib administer patient HCL . II . To characterize progression-free ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) single-agent ibrutinib administer patient HCL . III . To determine rate molecular remission ( minimal residual disease [ MRD ] -negative CR ) among patient , define resolution detectable disease limit detection immunohistochemistry and/or 4-color flow cytometry assay 32 week begin ibrutinib therapy . IV . To characterize immunologic outcome single agent ibrutinib administration . V. To explore effect ibrutinib ( PCI-32765 ) traditional new biomarkers HCL include : confirmation expression BRAFV600E leukemia cell ; pharmacodynamic effect BTK inhibition phosphorylated ( phospho ) ERK regulation , well potential protein kinase target ibrutinib ( exploratory ) ; serum soluble IL-2 receptor correlation response ibrutinib therapy ; documentation quantification minimal residual disease follow maximal response , flow cytometric analysis immunohistochemical stain bone marrow , predictor remission duration ibrutinib therapy . OUTLINE : Patients receive ibrutinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month .</detailed_description>
