	<brief_summary>The objective study identify gene whose expression potentially modifiable due change folate intake help delineate mechanism account variability individual response folic acid supplementation . The study conduct normal weight obese woman childbearing age , supplement 8 week 800 mcg/day folic acid . It hypothesize ( 1 ) change folate status , induce supplementation , influence DNA methylation specific gene ( 2 ) DNA methylation response folic acid supplementation may differ normal weight obese woman childbearing age .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study conduct two phase . An initial screening study perform determine folate status , MTHFR677 genotype body composition potential participant intervention study . Both folate status MTHFR677 genotype know independent predictor response folic acid supplementation . Blood sample collect , overnight fast , determination serum folate concentration MTHFR677 genotyping . Body composition 24-hr dietary recall also conduct screen visit . The second phase eight week supplementation trial 800 mcg/day folic acid . Screened individual determine serum folate &lt; 30 nmol/L ( &lt; 50th percentile NHANES 1999-2004 ) CC CT genotype ( MTHFR677 ) eligible inclusion supplementation trial . Participants instruct avoid dietary supplement , fortify ready-to-eat cereal , high folate content food intervention . Blood sample collect , overnight fast , baseline 4 8 week supplementation determination primary ( DNA methylation profile ) secondary ( nutritional , metabolic health status biomarkers ) outcome measure .</detailed_description>
