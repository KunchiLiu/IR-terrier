	<brief_summary>Stroke third lead cause death United States . Of affected stroke , third becomes permanently disable . Risk factor stroke include , limited , advance age , physical inactivity , arterial stiffness , commonly , high blood pressure . Stroke major form much boarder problem , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . CVD consider primary cause death US . Interestingly , increase arterial stiffness elastic artery ( carotid aorta ) show strongly correlate CVD stroke . Increased arterial stiffness consider independent risk development CVD stroke . Hence , arterial stiffness suggest potential therapeutic target CVD specifically stroke . Recently , whole-body vibration ( WBV ) exercise propose new effective method improve muscle mass muscle strength young old individual . It known systemic arterial stiffness decrease 40 min single WBV session healthy men . In laboratory , show leg arterial stiffness decrease session WBV . Taken together , data seem suggest WBV may use viable way decrease arterial stiffness . Special population , post-stroke patient , may unwilling unable perform WBV exercise inactive form exercise ( vibration ) therapy need . Passive vibration ( PV ) , allow patient lie inactive , supine position , leg place onto vibration plate . This expose low limbs continuous vibration without perform voluntary muscle contraction . PV show increase skin blood flow vibrate extremity vasodilation healthy individual type 2 diabetic . Previous work laboratory demonstrate 10-min session PV legs decrease augmentation index ( AIx ) , marker pressure wave reflection , well leg systemic PWV decrease local peripheral resistance young men . However , effect PV arterial function post-stroke patient unknown . It hypothesize post-stroke patient demonstrate decrease leg PWV central AIx . However , great response expect low vibration frequency .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The purpose study examine effect one acute bout low high frequency passive vibration blood pressure , heart rate , arterial stiffness , wave reflection , autonomic function post-stroke patient . The specific aim study : -To evaluate effect acute bout high ( 40Hz/low amplitude ) low frequency ( 25Hz/high amplitude ) passive vibration arterial function aortic hemodynamics assess blood pressure ( systolic , diastolic , mean , pulse pressure ) , arterial stiffness ( aortic , systemic , leg ) , aortic wave reflection ( augmentation index ) , autonomic function ( heart rate variability ) .</detailed_description>
