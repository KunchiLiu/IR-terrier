	<brief_summary>The purpose study look level HIV medication ( raltegravir ) blood , affect raltegravir take time another medicine high blood pressure ( amlodipine ) . Many patient HIV also high blood pressure , important know drug condition take together without affect well work individually . Over 3 week period , participant take amlodipine 2 week , raltegravir 2 week , middle week drug . The investigator look compare level two drug blood subject take separately together . This study randomise two group study medication receive participant three-period crossover pattern ; randomisation determine medication take first . Once randomised allocation perform , medication administer open-label fashion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Two Way Cross Over Pharmacokinetic Interaction Study Between Raltegravir Amlodipine Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV-negative male female volunteer enrol , write confirmation inform consent , phase I , open-label , cross-over , PK study ( approve Westminster Research Ethics Committee UK Regulatory Authorities ; Eudra number 2012-005400-18 ) . Subjects randomize receive either raltegravir 400mg twice-daily ( seven day ) , follow raltegravir 400mg twice-daily plus amlodipine 5mg once-daily ( seven day ) , follow amlodipine 5mg once-daily alone ( seven day ) , treatment opposite order , fast state ( least eight hour ) 240mL water . Intensive PK sample safety laboratory analysis perform end phase ( Days 7 , 14 21 ) . Raltegravir amlodipine plasma concentration analyse validated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry ( LC-MS/MS ) method . PK parameter determine non-compartmental method [ WinNonlin Phoenix ( version 6.1 ; Pharsight Corp , Mountain View , CA , USA ] . These concentration measure 12 24 hour post-dose ( C12h , C24h ) raltegravir amlodipine , respectively ; maximum concentration ( Cmax ) ; area curve 12 24 hour ( AUC12h , AUC24h ) raltegravir amlodipine , respectively .</detailed_description>
