	<brief_summary>The investigator conduct study try improve ability identify old adult high-risk progression Alzheimer 's disease , several year symptom might reduce quality life . The investigator believe increase sensitivity test memory problem solving , use small dose medication ( scopolamine ) reduce activity principal chemical system brain change early stage Alzheimer 's disease . By pair `` micro-dose '' drug challenge ( administer tiny needle place surface skin forearm ) , test memory thinking , believe investigator create `` stress test '' similar concept use exercise treadmill make result heart EKG sensitive detect early disease , cardiac stress test heart disease . The investigator want create similar stress test Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Detection Disease-Related Changes Pre-Symptomatic Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>We take picture subject ' brain use PET imaging , healthy old adult ( age 55 80 year ) family history AD , concern change memory ( clinical symptom AD ) , see much protein - related AD -is brain . When subject come hospital PET imaging , review entire study plan , risk benefit participation , obtain write informed consent time . Our goal compare performance new stress test PET imaging result . Once PET image do , subject come clinical research unit day-long baseline visit . In morning give test memory thinking , administer injection scopolamine low dose . We continue examine subject , give memory think test 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , 8 hour post-dosing . Once fully-recovered effect medication , allow go home day . We see subject , much short visit complete cognitive test , 9 18 month initial study visit . We follow subject 18 month see show mild measurable change memory thinking test , predict person also strong result stress test first study visit . At three study visit clinical research unit , obtain measurement use image device us infrared blue light take picture eye retina . Our secondary goal study search evidence protein , retina , build see PET image brain person high risk AD . Finally , also collect small sample saliva , first visit unit , order see subject genetic risk disease , genetic risk may affect interpret result new `` cognitive stress test '' . In study , small dose already approve medication ( use treat seasickness ) use temporarily , safely , mimic sign early disease first day test . This methodological study determine test measure think predict risk dementia age .</detailed_description>
