	<brief_summary>The gluteus medius ( Gmed ) gluteus maximus ( Gmax ) muscle important component treatment many low limb injury . Recent study evaluate myriad exercise activate Gmed Gmax , limit research remain exercise involve resistance role TFL . The purpose study evaluate Gmed , Gmax , TFL percent maximal voluntary isometric contraction ( % MVIC ) perceive exertion healthy low back pain patient perform exercise without resistance . Methods : A convenience sample healthy subject patient diagnose non-radicular low back pain recruit . Exclusionary criterion include : current low back low extremity injury ( healthy group ) , pregnancy , history hip surgery , radicular symptom . Surface electromyography use quantify activity level gluteal muscle TFL perform series 8 exercise without Thera-Band® Resistance Tubing Stability Trainer . The maximal voluntary isometric contraction ( MVIC ) establish muscle group order exercise perform randomized minimize effect fatigue . Following completion exercise , patient rate perceive exertion level Thera-Band® Resistance Intensity Scale Exercise ( RISE ) . The EMG signal smooth rectified analyzed use root-mean-square algorithm . Clinical Relevance : The result study allow clinician well prescribe exercise , proven activate gluteal muscle limit TFL involvement , treatment low back pain .</brief_summary>
