	<brief_summary>A dual POC immunoassay simultaneously detect non-treponemal treponemal antibody develop diagnosis infection T. pallidum . The assay design use resource-limited setting challenge condition ( lack electricity , run water , laboratory equipment ) commonly exist . We seek compare performance dual-POC assay diagnosis yaw infection RPR TPHA reference standard .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dual Point-of-care Test Diagnosis Yaws</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Yaws infectious disease cause Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue , bacterium closely resemble causative agent syphilis , spread skin skin contact . In field , yaws diagnose basis epidemiological context , evocative symptom sign positive serological test dark field microscopy . The darkfield microscopy easy perform , hence interest serological test . The serological test use confirm yaw use diagnose syphilis . Yaws serologic diagnosis relies test non-treponemal treponemal antibody . These antibody differ markedly respect antigenic reactivity kinetics disease process . Historically screen yaws involve use nontreponemal test , rapid plasma reagin venereal disease research laboratory . Positive result nontreponemal test specimen confirm use specific treponemal test , Treponema pallidum haemagglutination . However , equipment personnel requirement conduct interpret laboratory-tests rarely available low-resource setting develop country yaw occurs . Rapid treponemal test detect antibody T. pallidum antigen become popular diagnosis venereal syphilis due many advantage . These test perform outside laboratory set minimal train use blood collect finger prick , make extremely useful remote area laboratory available . However , rapid treponemal test syphilis detect treponemal antibody , limit use interpretation disease status since distinguish active past treat infection . A combined point-of-care ( POC ) test detect treponemal non-treponemal antibody recently evaluate diagnosis syphilis , appear promise yaws diagnosis . The use dual POC test would result ability screen confirm serological status patient suspect yaw within 15 minute give good indication active disease .</detailed_description>
