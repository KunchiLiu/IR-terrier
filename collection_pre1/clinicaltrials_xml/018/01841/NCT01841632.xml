	<brief_summary>MultiStem ® new biological product , manufacture human stem cell obtain adult bone marrow . Factors express MultiStem cell believe regulate immune system function augment tissue repair . Standard care pharmacological immunosuppression liver transplantation achieve reasonable survival liver graft patient . The side effect treatment , however , clinically significant diminish overall success organ transplantation curative therapy . It therefore objective study implement cellular immunomodulation therapy MultiStem adjunct standard pharmacological immunosuppression ultimate goal significantly reduce drug-based immunosuppression . As first study MultiStem subject population design safety feasibility trial . However , first evidence potential benefit patient population explore cautiously .</brief_summary>
