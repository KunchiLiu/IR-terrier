	<brief_title>Pazopanib Hydrochloride Treating Patients With Progressive Carcinoid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . For patient progressive carcinoid tumor , progression-free survival ( PFS define central review accord Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors [ RECIST ] 1.1 ) compare patient randomize treatment pazopanib ( pazopanib hydrochloride ) versus placebo . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Overall survival compare treatment arm . II . Objective response rate , duration response , time treatment failure compare treatment arm . III . Progression free survival assess central radiology review local radiology review compare overall within treatment arm . IV . PFS 6 month 12 month estimate within treatment arm . V. Safety tolerability treatment pazopanib/placebo evaluate within treatment arm . VI . Biochemical response ( chromogranin A , define decrease 50 % chromogranin A level baseline 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid [ 5-HIAA ] , define decrease 50 % urinary 5-HIAA level baseline ) compare treatment arm among patient elevate baseline level chromogranin A ( CGA ) 5-HIAA . VII . PFS indicator efficacy estimate patient crossover pazopanib placebo . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Average time submission scan Imaging Core Laboratory ( ICL ) average ICL `` turn-around '' time estimate . II . Discordance local central radiology review assessment progression estimate . III . The rate quality radiographic progression ( pre-study , on-study , post-progression ) characterize . IV . To assess difference quality life ( QOL ) -related domain two treatment group ( pazopanib versus placebo ) . V. To determine brief measure QOL-related domain provide comparable information provide long assessment ( European Organization Research Treatment Cancer [ EORTC ] , neuroendocrine tumor [ NET ] 21 ) . VI . To provide validation data EORTC NET21 module term responsiveness time difference across arm . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive pazopanib hydrochloride orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive placebo PO QD day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . At time progressive disease , patient may cross-over Arm I . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3-6 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
