	<brief_title>Pramlintide ( Symlin ) Treatment Hypoglycemia Following Gastric Bypass Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study open-label short-term proof concept study . The investigator administer pramlintide patient severe post-prandial hypoglycemia follow gastric bypass , order determine whether pramlintide effective reducing frequency severity hypoglycemia . Pramlintide prescribe 8 week . In order ass efficacy pramlintide prevent post-prandial hypoglycemia hypoglycemic symptom , investigator compare ( ) blood glucose measurement frequency hypoglycemic symptom , end drug intervention , use capillary glucose monitoring continuous glucose monitoring , ( b ) glycemic , hormonal , energetic response three-hour mixed meal tolerance test . The study utilize open label design evaluate efficacy pramlintide patient gastric bypass severe postprandial hypoglycemia . The study randomize blind . The investigator recruit 26 participant Joslin Diabetes Center . Briefly , participant study ask complete 4 study visit . The first visit screen . They ask keep 3-day log record food intake ( include estimate portion size ) , blood glucose eight time daily , well hypoglycemic symptom , initiate treatment . At second study visit , undergo mixed meal tolerance test , serve baseline evaluation . Patterns ( ) glucose excursion ( initial postprandial peak , subsequent postprandial fall potential hypoglycemia ) , ( b ) hormonal response ( insulin , C-peptide , glucagon , incretins ) assess . At end mixed meal , satiety assess use visual analog scale . Baseline hypoglycemia frequency severity assess review patient glucose hypoglycemia symptom log record prior visit . At completion visit 2 , pramlintide prescribe , instruction titration drug minimal maximal dose ( see titration schedule ) help reduce incidence side effect . During treatment period , participant keep record hypoglycemic symptom blood glucose measurement time . There one follow-up visit ( visit 3 ) middle treatment period evaluation symptom tolerance medication . During last ( eighth ) week treatment , comparison pre-treatment glycemia , participant complete food diary , measure record blood glucose eight time daily 3 day . During final week study , participant also come fourth study visit , undergo repeat mixed meal tolerance test comparison pre-treatment result .</detailed_description>
