	<detailed_description>Stroke devastate disease one primary cause death long term morbidity impose heavy burden patient , relatives health care system . Except fibrinolytic therapy , possible minor fraction patient , widely approve medication treatment acute stroke . Cerebrolysin approve treatment stroke 45 country worldwide . Since approval Cerebrolysin , stroke therapy evolve , namely , improve overall care , stroke unit , target rehabilitation , increase availability fibrinolytic therapy ( rtPA , Actilyse ) specialize center throughout world . More recently , interventional therapy various thrombus retriever emerge . In addition Cerebrolysin treatment stroke evolve different time window , dosage lengths therapy give pragmatic way physician within specification Product Characteristics Cerebrolysin ( SPC ) . The main aim study capture variables Cerebrolysin treatment comedication order give guidance research . This research may consist extension current registry target research one several subgroup patient respond Cerebrolysin treatment . It therefore overall aim registry study monitor effectiveness safety Cerebrolysin therapy background establish evolve stroke therapy . In concomitant control group therapies alone combination compare addition Cerebrolysin patient . Of particular interest treatment stroke unit , rtPA systematic rehabilitation . An open observational treatment design choose collect data capture therapy apply real clinical practice avoid selection bias typical control study exclude majority patient participation . In order overcome observational bias major inherent limitation open trial design , remote blind assessment do : three month treatment patient ' assessment modify Rankin Scale ( mRS , widely accept primary outcome parameter ) -after specific inform consent- video-taped subsequently assess least two independent blind assessor experience remote assessment mRS .</detailed_description>
