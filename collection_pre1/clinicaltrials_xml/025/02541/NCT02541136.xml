	<brief_title>Neural Changes Exercise : Functional MRI Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mental disorder major cause long-term disability direct cause mortality , approximately 800,000 individual die suicide every year worldwide - high proportion arise major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . Knowledge MDD expand recent year detect neuroplasticity may play core role pathophysiology disease . Neuroplasticity context refers brain 's ability change thus might presupposition building strategy mental disorder . The best-characterized studied example neuroplasticity molecular cellular adaptation underlie learn exercise . Exercise improve cognition , antidepressant effect also find positive effect brain structure measure magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Further , research older adult indicate increase aerobic fitness neuroprotective enhance brain structure function . Increase gray matter volume parietal frontal brain region correspond increase diffusivity white matter fibre see early 2 week train balance task . On hand experimental study find stress chronic exposure high level glucocorticoid lead depressive-like state . These state accompany atrophy loss neuron adult hippocampus temporal lobe brain region involve learning , memory mood regulation . Hippocampal damage , result excessive exposure brain glucocorticoid , lead impaired feedback inhibition hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ( HPA ) axis glucocorticoid , cause unrestrained release axis - `` Glucocorticoid Cascade Hypothesis '' . Prolonged stress , excess allostatic load , thus harmful probably important process mediate dementia . Efficient stress response necessary cope change environment ability terminate stress response central importance return homeostasis . Individuals depression relatively high cortisol secretory tone blunt diurnal secretory pattern cortisol secretion , reflect poor regulatory feedback hippocampus . Higher cortisol stress response awaken ( CAR ) , conversely , find chronically stress , depress remit depression bipolar disorder , adolescent later develop depression . Interestingly , investigator find structural change hippocampus , brain region involve memory emotion regulation , become pronounced patient depression develop chronic disease course . Recently , detect hippocampal volume patient MDD , carry also genetic risk-allele ( SLC6A4 , 5-HTTLPR ) , small history emotional neglect compare patient genetic emotional neglect risk factor separately . In context neuroimaging , diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) , significant step forward characterize microstructural change difference , highly interest . Using high angular resolution diffusion imaging , investigator find unaffected healthy first degree relatives patient MDD strong fiber connection prefrontal temporo-parietal brain region manage incidence early life adversity without later develop depression suggest resilience may associate strong connection . This line research suggest structural functional brain change already manifestation disease change seem related individual ' vulnerability . Thus , prevent brain change , normalize stress function increase resilience individual major challenge future order prevent major stress-related mental disorder . The ability brain adapt suggests might possible increase resilience order protect individual become depressed . In addition exercise learning , cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) remediation program show effect brain structure function patient manifest disorder like depression schizophrenia especially combination CBT exercise learning might result prominent outcome . Neuroplastic brain change report CBT . For example , behavioral activation therapy depression , psychotherapy modality design increase engagement positive stimulus reduce avoidance behavior , result decreased activation prefrontal structure , include paracingulate gyrus , right orbitofrontal cortex , right frontal pole , symptom depression improve . Elevated amygdala-hippocampal activity decrease reduced ACC activity increase 16 week CBT 16 patient MDD . A recent review highlight effect brief working memory training across different study brain activation multiple region include dorsolateral prefrontal cortex , parietal cortex , occipital cortex . Interestingly , cycle show increase volume hippocampus patient schizophrenia healthy comparison subject , change non-exercise group patient . This suggest CBT exercise impact recovery brain system condition like schizophrenia MDD . Effects resilience program never investigate neuroimaging , although would possible achieve information structure white matter fiber bundle connect certain brain region . Psychological construct promote resilience - ability cope stressful situation - include commitment , patience , optimism self-esteem , addition capacity modulate emotion develop adaptive social behavior . These trait implicate brain 's cognitive-emotional interplay , seem critical determinant emergence pathological rather resilient phenotype . The cognitive-emotional interplay functional brain connectivity study use functional MRI . Interestingly , use functional MRI show bias emotional cognitive processing exist patient MDD . Aims : The aim current proposal carry 20 week last extensive resilience program order stimulate resilience healthy unaffected population expose normal day-to-day work stress hospital . The investigator measure effectiveness program examine behavioral , diurnal cortisol secretion rhythm stress response , microstructural well functional neural change . Hypotheses : The `` Resilience '' program stimulate resilience indicated 1. improve mood stability , good sleep quality high life quality 2. increase hippocampal anterior cingulate cortex volume 3. increase functional connectivity frontal limbic brain region . 4. increase fractional anisotropy ( FA ) , measure function white matter fiber , limbic frontal brain region . 5. increase gradient diurnal secretion cortisol ; decrease stress response measure cortisol awaken response Methods Materials Participants Forty healthy volunteer , e.g . Adelaide Meath Hospital , Dublin ( AMiNCH ) staff , recruit . They history neurological , mental ( axis I axis II ) chronic internal disease . Further exclusion criterion participant previous head injury loss consciousness . Moreover , member fitness clubs engage intensive day day activity . The 40 healthy volunteer randomize 20 week `` resilience '' program , 45 minute exercise two time per week supervision physiotherapist well 2 home session ; control group without program , two session 45-minute exercise/jogging complete week Clinical assessment do weekly . Neuroimaging salivary cortisol awake test carry baseline 20 week resilience program group ( N=20 ) control group ( N=20 ) . Clinical assessment The NEO-FFI personality questionnaire structure clinical interview DSM disorder ( SCID ) -I II carry initially exclude history , current , psychiatric disorder . Mood assess use Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ) , Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale ( HAM-A ) , Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) baseline bi-weekly . Moreover , current life stressor evaluate interview conduct accord Keller et al . weekly basis ; Life quality ( Study-Short Form 36-Item Health Survey ( SF-36 , QoL-Bref ) Pittsburgh sleep quality index ( PSQI ) , also carry bi-weekly . Early life stress assess use childhood trauma questionnaire ( CTQ ) . The NEO-FFI personality questionnaire SCID-I II also carry inclusion . Handedness determine Edinburgh inventory . Neuroimaging technique MRI image obtain 3.0 Tesla MRI ( Phillips Achieva ) , locate Trinity College Institute Neuroscience ( TCIN ) . MRI carry use 60 minute image protocol . Diffusion Tensor Imaging ( DTI ) : In vivo DTI acquire use single-shot echo-planar imaging ( EPI ) sequence SENSE parallel image scheme ( SENSivitiy Encoding ) . The diffusion weight encode 61 independent direction . After pre-processing program ExploreDTI , tractography ExploreDTI tract-based spatial statistic use TBSS ( www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/tbss/index.html , FSL ) carry . We experience use technique perform analysis ( 25 ) . Functional MRI : In order identify functional change emotion regulation system , apply fMRI paradigm . We use Echo Planar Imaging ( EPI ) , T2*-weighted gradient-echo imaging visualise BOLD contrast ( TR 2000 m , TE 30 m , flip angle 90Â° , matrix 80 x 80 , FOV 224 x 224 x 150 mm , resolution : 3.5 x 3.5 mm , slice thickness : 3.5 mm ) . A cognitive-emotional inhibition task , well establish laboratory , use . Participants ask process visual emotional stimulus either emotional cognitive way . This task choose specifically , know elicit activity prefrontal cortex , amygdala , gyrus cinguli , orbitofrontal cortex , region implicate pathophysiology MDD . SPM8-based standard analysis , functional connectivity analysis ( 33 ) Psycho-Physiological Interaction ( PPI ) analysis do . Structural technique : Additionally , aim track structural change confirm well extend recent finding area . Therefore , subject scan T1-weighted 3D-MPRAGE sequence ( repetition time , 8.5 m ; echo time , 3.5 m ; total acquisition time , 7 min 30 sec ; number acquisition , 1 ; field view , 250 x 256 x 160 mm ; resolution : 0.86x0.86x0.86 mm ) . Region interest ( ROI ) analysis hippocampus amygdala well optimised voxel-based morphometry ( VBM ) use data analysis previously do lab . Saliva cortisol sample These collect participate subject two successive week-days , work day . Subjects spit small plastic tube wakening , 30 , 45 , 60 90 min later ; even ( 12h waking ) prior go bed . The sample store participant domestic fridge post batch prepare envelope research centre . Calculation sample size The investigator previously conduct number longitudinal imaging study . Based experience , 20 subject group sufficient obtain significant effect , signal change order 0.2 % 0.3 % typically find cognitive-emotional task least 5 % microstructural change find structural MRI DTI . Thus , 20 subject effect detectable .</detailed_description>
