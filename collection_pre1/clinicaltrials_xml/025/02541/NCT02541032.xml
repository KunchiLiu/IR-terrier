	<detailed_description>Stroke fourth lead cause death lead cause long-term adult disability United States . Stroke remain common North South Carolina , part `` buckle '' stroke belt , disproportionately impact African Americans . The reason racial disparity poorly understand entirely explain traditional stroke risk factor . The REGARDS study find tooth loss ( surrogate periodontal disease ) common among African Americans white associate high stroke risk stroke risk factor . Given result , REGARDS investigator postulate periodontal disease may contribute racial disparity stroke . Additional data study show low socioeconomic status ( SES ) associate great tooth loss , see frequently African Americans oppose white counterpart . Considering factor , question arises whether low SES , race , combination two , and/or traditional risk factor contribute tooth loss , periodontal disease , recurrent vascular event . Howard colleague suggest paper race predominant factor contribute vascular event adjustment SES risk factor . If predisposition exists among African Americans great periodontal disease incident vascular event , modification clinician make prevent recurrent vascular event population ? The PREMIERS study proposal conduct adequately power two-center phase III randomize control trial test whether intensive periodontal treatment reduces risk recurrent vascular event among ischemic stroke TIA survivor . The study use resource state include establish dental center , Joint Commission Certified Stroke Centers , Schools Public Health , Institute Partnerships Eliminate Health Disparities . The proposal address specific issue regard recruitment African-American rural stroke/TIA patient advocate use culturally appropriate strategy educate study subject regard stroke , periodontal disease periodontal stroke link . The study propose utilize economic evaluation periodontal intervention budgetary perspective . The focus financial sustainability provide aggressive periodontal therapy ( certain , although relatively low expenditure ) exchange reduction uncertain recurrent vascular event may require high cost emergency department utilization and/or inpatient care . The sustainability propose intervention completion project integrally link health economic assessment show health care cost saving . By integration rural primary care center , African American majority household average incomes state average , study ensures propose intervention reduce stroke disparity applicable target population . Objectives : The investigator propose conduct phase III randomize control trial test whether intensive periodontal treatment reduces risk recurrent vascular event among ischemic stroke TIA survivor . Since AAs United States 50-64 year age approximately three time PD white age group , study also contribute investigator understand exist racial disparity stroke incidence United States . The follow specific aim propose : Aim 1 : Evaluate effect periodontal treatment recurrent vascular event ( PRIMARY OUTCOME ) among ischemic stroke/TIA survivor . Research Questions : 1.1 ) Are recurrent vascular event less likely among individual receive intensive periodontal treatment versus control treatment among stroke TIA survivor ? 1.2 ) Is effect periodontal treatment different AAs white ? Aim 2 : Evaluate effect periodontal treatment stroke risk factor ( SECONDARY OUTCOME ) among stroke TIA survivor . Research Questions : 2.1 ) What effect intensive periodontal treatment carotid artery intimal medial ( IMT ) thicken high sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP ) among stroke TIA survivor ? 2.2 ) Is difference AA white ischemic stroke/TIA survivor effect intensive periodontal treatment carotid IMT thicken hs-CRP among individual receive intensive periodontal treatment versus control treatment ? 2.3 ) What effect intensive periodontal treatment control blood pressure dyslipidemia among stroke survivor ? 2.4 ) Is difference AA white ischemic stroke/TIA survivor effect intensive periodontal treatment control blood pressure dyslipidemia ? Aim 3 : Disseminate information regard periodontal care , method stroke prevention , result trial community culturally appropriate manner . Design Procedures A . Study Overview : Consenting patient admit University South Carolina ( USC ) Palmetto Health Hospital University North Carolina ( UNC ) Neuroscience Hospital recent ischemic stroke TIA ( ≤ 90 day ) , initially screen periodontal status . Individuals least five teeth present sign initial/severe periodontitis consider enrollment . These potential participant assess serum inflammatory marker hs-CRP , stroke risk factor , carotid IMT , medication use ( e.g . antiplatelet agent , anticoagulant , statin , BP therapy ) SES . Participants randomize use 1:1 adaptive randomization protocol aggressive periodontal therapy ( scale root plan [ S &amp; RP ] + standard care stroke prevention strategy ) versus standard dental care community dental referral + standardize stroke prevention . Both group patient 12-month duration follow-up assess vascular event , stroke risk factor carotid IMT . A total 400 patient randomize two center three year . B . Study population : The study population draw consecutive stroke TIA patient present inpatient service outpatient clinic USC Palmetto Health Richland Stroke Center UNC Comprehensive Stroke Center . Both center Joint Commission Certified Stroke Centers locate amidst Stroke Belt serve regional referral center several rural underserved county respective state . There average 1,330 ischemic stroke/TIA patient admit annually USC , 50 % AAs , 52 % male , approximately 20 % self-pay/Medicaid patient ; average 875 ischemic stroke/TIA patient admit annually UNC , 38 % AAs , 48 % male , approximately 20 % self-pay/Medicaid patient . Minority female patient aggressively recruited ensure least 50 % minority 40 % female representation . Both center significant experience recruit stroke/TIA patient prospective longitudinal stroke study . At UNC preliminary data collect propose study . At USC , 12-month period enrol 100 stroke/TIA patient , 42 % AA 39 % female separate prospective longitudinal study . We estimate 2,000 ischemic stroke/TIA patient screen eligibility period three year ( 333 screened/year/center ) . The researcher estimate use screen criterion , 800 subject deem eligible , 400 randomize ( 200 treatment arm ) . With estimate drop-out rate approximately 10 % , researcher estimate obtain least 180 evaluable patient arm one year follow-up data . Study Outcomes The study use vascular event form ischemic stroke , MI , cardiovascular death primary outcome event . Outcome event adjudicate Principal Investigator analyze composite outcome three , six , nine , 12 month randomization . - Ischemic stroke : diagnosed patient develop new focal neurological deficit sudden onset , think vascular cause , last least 24 hour , associate brain hemorrhage brain CT MRI available . Situations symptoms last &lt; 24 hour without evidence new infarct regard TIAs . - Acute MI : define accord criterion modified 2000 Consensus Conference European American Colleges Cardiology , base symptom electrocardiogram change , conjunction contemporary biochemical marker myocardial necrosis ( troponin creatine kinase ) . - Cardiovascular Death : classified 'cardiac death ' 'other cardiovascular death ' . Cardiac death must cardiac cause main reason death . All cardiovascular death define 'other cardiovascular death ' ( e.g . stroke , bleed episode , pulmonary embolism procedural ) . - Etiological classification stroke : classify use Trial Org 10172 Acute Stroke Treatment ( TOAST ) criterion . This analysis , along stroke sub-typing , help differentiate cardioembolism versus atherothrombotic event arise share risk factor . The study measure progression atherosclerosis ( carotid IMT ) stroke risk factor secondary outcome : Progression Atherosclerosis Measurement : The dependent variable carotid artery IMT ≥1-mm , derive dichotomize IMT 1-mm . The 1-mm cut point choose clinical prognostic significance , associate subsequent development coronary heart disease stroke . • Carotid IMT measure B-mode ultrasound participant baseline one-year followup visit . Analyses base mean IMT far wall 1-cm length right leave carotid bifurcation internal common carotid artery . Measurement stroke risk factor : - Blood Pressure ( BP ) record baseline follow-up : six 12 month randomization . Averaged consecutive triplicate reading obtain semiautomatic Omron oscillometric BP monitor . Individuals rest five minute sit semi-reclined position dental chair , BP recording perform . Patients rest one minute blood pressure reading . - Blood sample : Serial blood sample collect baseline follow-up : 12 month randomization . These blood sample assess hs-CRP , hemoglobin A1C , fast lipid profile blind fashion . Measurement vascular cognitive impairment : - To assess vascular cognitive impairment , standardized clinical assessment , Montreal Cognitive Assessment MOCA , administer participant baseline one-year followup visit . The test assess eight domain cognitive functioning : attention concentration , executive function , memory , language , visuoconstructional skill , conceptual thinking , calculation , orientation . - White mater disease assess FLAIR scan obtain initial clinical , standard care MRI and/or CT scan stroke/TIA patient receive</detailed_description>
