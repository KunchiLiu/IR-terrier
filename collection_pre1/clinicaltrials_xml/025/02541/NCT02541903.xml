	<brief_summary>Penile squamous cell carcinoma ( PSCC ) highly aggressive relatively rare disease . Supportive evidence value systemic therapy exist disease agent currently approve regulatory agency . This study evaluate drug Gilotrif patient metastatic progressive PSCC follow chemotherapy . Gilotrif show supportive evidence non-small cell lung cancer inhibit certain protein also find PSCC . The drug potential patient exhibit response contribute great quality life .</brief_summary>
