PPA type dementia language decline cognitive skill ( include memory ) preserve first several year onset ( see Mesulam 1982 ) . This make initial stage PPA excellent candidate treatment create window time ( 2-7 year ) whereby PPA individual lead independent life minimal support .

For reason , anomia focus intervention . Participants PPA study receive two kind therapy word recall spontaneously , train maintain social interaction . The type training base successful intervention investigator provide people PPA previous work ( active encode errorless lerning ) . The investigator expect successful re-learning forgotten word practice group set facilitate retention communication skill lead great personal independence increased/maintained quality life people PPA . half cohort ( randomly determine ) participate communication group conversation encourage half attend `` non-verbal '' group meeting paint , watch movie engage activity require talk . To evaluate benefit practice re-learned word social set name skill test participant individual group intervention .</detailed_description>
