	<brief_summary>In Europe , breast cancer far common form cancer diagnose woman today , account 29 % case . The 5-year survival rate approximately 90 % . Surgery usually combine radiotherapy ( RT ) , anthracyclines , aromatase inhibitor and/or trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) improve life expectancy survival breast cancer patient . Unfortunately , RT associate broad spectrum cardiovascular disease , include coronary artery disease , valvular dysfunction , congestive heart failure stroke , common non-malignancy cause death . During last two decade , RT regimens breast cancer change dos radiation heart expose potentially low due new improve RT technique . However , data whether new regime decrease risk cardiovascular disease . In study incidence prevalence cardiovascular disease estimate 8 15 year conventional laser assist breath control RT , compare cardiovascular disease general female population . A aim evaluate sign prevalence acute cardiotoxicity RT use cardiac magnetic resonance imaging , coronary fractional flow reserve , ECG inflammatory cardiac biomarkers investigate whether sign predict later cardiovascular disease . The importance traditional cardiovascular risk factor ( age , hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , smoke habit physical activity , register RT ) also evaluate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study observational study . In 2007-2012 conventional RT part common treatment regime breast cancer , recently replace laser assist breath control RT . Thus , two cohort breast cancer patient treat different mode RT follow development cardiovascular disease subsequent 15 year .</detailed_description>
