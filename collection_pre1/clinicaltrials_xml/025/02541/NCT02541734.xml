	<brief_summary>The highly promising innovative tracer 111In-DTPA-AHX-Lys40-Exendin 4 applied determine beta cell mass healthy volunteer patient type 1 diabetes . However , high retention tracer kidney lead kidney/pancreas uptake ratio 41±23 . This high renal uptake complicate absolute BCM quantification SPECT imaging . In order reduce kidney/pancreas uptake ratio , investigator propose co-infusion plasma expander Gelofusine since show several pre-clinical clinical study Gelofusine reduce renal retention several , closely related tracer . When investigator able reduce kidney/pancreas uptake ratio , finding improve interpretation clinical quantitative SPECT , important implication therapeutic decision making patient diabetes , insulinomas congenital hyperinsulinism , may also major impact understand pathophysiology disease .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Beta-cell image vivo Reliable , sensitive specific non-invasive method comprehensive structural functional characterization live pancreatic beta-cells vivo ( vitro ) would enhance understanding pathophysiology various disease , also enable longitudinal vivo assessment beta cell mass ( BCM ) distribution patient e.g . diabetes ( include patient receive beta cell replacement therapy ) . Additionally , help diagnose insulinomas congenital hyperinsulinism couple biomarkers could aid patient stratification enable patient-specific optimized treatment strategy . Inhibiting reabsorption radiolabelled peptide It show , vitro vivo , kidney uptake radiolabelled peptide reduce co-infusion agent inhibit reabsorption peptide . One agent succinylated gelatin ( Gelofusine ) , plasma expander consist mixture collagen-derived peptide . Previous clinical observation show Gelofusine infusion result tubular proteinuria albumin β2-microglobulin . Although exact mechanism proteinuria completely understood , megalin receptor system likely involve . Based pre-clinical study mouse rat , know kidney uptake significantly reduce various tracer co-infused Gelofusine , like 111In-Octreotide 111In-Minigastrin , 68Ga-exendin-4 111In-DTPA-AHX-Lys40-Exendin 4 . Additionally , show Gelofusine also reduce renal retention 111In- Octreotide 45 % human . In current study , investigator determine whether Gelofusine also effect kidney retention 111In-DTPA-AHX-Lys40-Exendin 4 human .</detailed_description>
