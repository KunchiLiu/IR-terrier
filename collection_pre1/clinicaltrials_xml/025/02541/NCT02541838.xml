	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes result host neuromuscular , muscular , autonomic system impairment accelerate age-associated limitation functional independence risk fall . Diabetic peripheral neuropathy ( DPN ) contribute functional decline balance mobility limitation metabolic abnormality . The constellation impairment accompany type 2 diabetes diminishes muscle function performance include strength power . Loss strength high speed movement ( deficit power ) occur neural activation muscle , change muscle property , old individual DPN compare old control . Consequently , deficit speed dependent muscle power production lead limitation rapidly respond sudden loss balance stability prevent fall . The goal pilot research program determine feasibility effectiveness mechanism-based therapeutic intervention fro improve balance mobility function prevent fall old adult DPN . The investigator pan use result pilot study design implement large randomize control trial .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The long-term goal research establish effectiveness mechanism-based therapeutic intervention improve balance mobility function prevent fall old adult type 2 diabetic peripheral neuropathy ( DPN ) . Specific Aim 1 determine combine high intensity isolate leg muscle power exercise balance perturbation training ( ActiveStep ) aerobic exercise achieves great improvement balance stabilization ( protective step behavior kinematics ) mobility function ( gait parameter time functional measure ) lifestyle base intervention primarily focus aerobic exercise underlie mechanism improve neuromuscular activation ( rate magnitude ) sensorimotor control , improve muscle quality , increase blood flow enhance neuromuscular sensorimotor performance people DPN . Specific Aim # 2 : To determine neuromotor balance training program combine muscle power exercise training aerobic exercise , lead improve neuromuscular sensorimotor mechanism , effective improve clinical test balance mobility function DPN compare traditional exercise intervention .</detailed_description>
