	<brief_title>Effects Lactobacillus Casei Respiratory Gastrointestinal Diseases Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Probiotic define `` live microorganism grant health effect host consume sufficient amount '' . Probiotic bacteria , beneficially affect host improve intestinal microbial balance , may affect immune response , thus boost body system combat disease . Respiratory tract infection ( RTI ) describe infection sinus , throat , airways lung . Generally , RTI categorize upper respiratory tract infection ( URTI ) low respiratory tract infection ( LRTI ) . Some common URTI like common cold , sinusitis , pharyngitis , epiglottitis laryngotracheitis ( croup ) examples LRTI bronchitis , bronchiolitis pneumonia . URTI main focus research . Despite continuous medical advancement , URTI remain burden vast global communities.In Malaysia , URTI take proportion 16.5 % 21.2 % disease diagnose public private health clinic respectively . Diarrhea one common symptom gastrointestinal disease . Diarrhea commonly define three loose watery stool last 24 hour . Probiotics Lactobacillus GG , Bifidobacterium lactis ( alone combination Streptococcus thermophiles ) , Lactobacillus reuteri , Lactobacillus casei Lactobacillus acidophilus report reduce diarrhea-related symptom strain-dependent dose-dependent manner . The rationale use probiotic infectious diarrhoea act enteric pathogen compete available nutrient bind site , make gut content acid , produce variety chemical , increase specific non-specific immune response . Lactobacillus casei Zhang ( LCZ ) identify unique probiotic strain show favorable probiotic characteristic like high acid bile tolerance , ability colonize gastrointestinal tract , addition antibacterial , antioxidative immunomodulatory property . LCZ first isolate koumiss collect Xilin Guole , Inner Mongolia , China group researcher Inner Mongolia Agricultural University . Koumiss type ferment horse milk drink commonly find Inner Mongolia , China report treat digestive disease chronic disease . LCZ already commercially available currently market China since 2010 , form beverage , tablet , powder capsule . Among well know product present market Bio-Plus , type plant base ferment soymilk beverage , Sci-Plus , multiple probiotic tablet . Research development involve LCZ many award . Among 2009 National Science Technology Progress Award China ( second prize ) , 2009 Inner Mongolia Natural Science Award ( first prize ) sixth DBN Technology Achievement Award . In addition , September 2014 , 11 patent file approve 8 patent review stage . Besides , 82 research paper relate LCZ also publish . Most research LCZ relate improve human 's health reduce susceptibility type II diabetes enhance human 's immune system , also relate food industry usage cheese make industry . More importantly , many probiotic report exert health benefit via maintain healthy gut profile . In recent clinical study , LCZ find significantly alter composition intestinal microbiota gut microbiota diversity , positive correlation beneficial microorganism Lactobacillus , Bifidobacterium unidentified genus Bacteroidaceae , negative correlation detrimental pathogens Clostridium , Serratia , Enterococcus , Shigella Shewanella , consumption 28 day . LCZ confirm safety consumption , intervention , produce HACCP ISO 22000 certify manufacturing plant ( GeneFerm Biotechnology Co. , Ltd. , Taiwan ) . LCZ contain porcine bovine ingredient obtain Halal certification Taiwan Halal Integrity Development Association ( THIDA ) , Taiwan , recognize Jabatan Kemajuan Islam Malaysia ( JAKIM ) , organization oversees implementation Halal requirement Malaysia . A total number 150 healthy adult age 18 -81 year old recruit study .</detailed_description>
