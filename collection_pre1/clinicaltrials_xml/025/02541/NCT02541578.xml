	<brief_summary>Physiological complexity gait , measure interaction multiple control mechanism walk within biological system , decreased person chronic stroke compare without disability . Thus , assume quantification gait complexity represent adaptability health individual . However , unknown level gait-related complexity improve time recovery stroke . Therefore , primary purpose study determine physiological complexity gait change first six month post stroke within contemporary healthcare environment . Secondary aim include 1 ) determine difference amount physiological complexity gait lateralization hemispheric damage stroke 2 ) explore relationship complexity low extremity motor impairment , walk speed balance . Sixty individual within one month post stroke great Indianapolis area recruit prospective , longitudinal outcome study . Testing session occur interval across first six month post stroke : within 1 month , 3 month , 6 month post stroke . During test session , participant complete 2-minute walking task accelerometer signal wireless inertial measurement unit collect converted sample entropy quantify physiological complexity gait . Additionally , measure quantify low extremity motor impairment , walk speed balance collect analyzed . Changes complexity gait early later stage stroke recovery may serve foundation prognosticate outcome , predict capacity community mobility and/or risk fall . The propose study meet critical need develop method differentiate among capacity adapt movement pattern individual neurological dysfunction . This work ultimately build upon evidence assist therapist tailor intervention way optimize function .</brief_summary>
