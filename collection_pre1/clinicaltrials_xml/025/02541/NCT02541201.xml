	<detailed_description>Plant sterol naturally occur functional equivalent mammalian cholesterol . Plant sterols differ structurally cholesterol methyl ethyl group side chain synthesize human body . These structural difference render minimally absorbable intestine . It consistently report dietary incorporation plant sterol ( 1.5-2 g/day ) reduce serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( LDL-C ) level minimal adverse event . The hypochoelsterolemic effect plant sterol explain inhibition cholesterol absorption , ascribe competition intestinal cholesterol incorporation mixed micelle , although possible mechanistic explanation propose .</detailed_description>
