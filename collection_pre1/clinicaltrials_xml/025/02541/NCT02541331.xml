	<brief_summary>This study evaluate efficacy Mechanical Bacterial Lysate ( PMBL - Ismigen® ) improve asthma control level ( ACT score ) add-on treatment routine asthma treatment child age 6 16 uncontrolled partly control asthma . Half 150 participant receive Ismigen® current asthma therapy half receive Placebo current asthma treatment .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy Of Bacterial Lysate In Asthmatic Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute recurrent respiratory infection upper middle respiratory tract paediatric population asthmatic patient represent lead clinical burden , particularly winter . Respiratory tract infection , mainly viral infection important factor exacerbate asthma course child . Currently clinical data demonstrate benefit oral sublingual bacterial lysates asthma clinical course child apart one trial OM-85 BV ( Bronchovaxom® ) suggest reduce number duration infection-related wheezing attack child asthma wheeze . Therefore hypothesized PMBL ( Ismigen® ) use asthmatic child significantly improve asthma course control . A seasonal approach active prevention , base full-fledged antibacterial oral vaccination would useful show potential benefit type product . The Primary objective ass benefit Ismigen® versus Placebo mean ACT score administration Polyvalent Mechanical Bacterial Lysate ( PMBL - Ismigen® ) add-on routine asthma treatment . Secondary objective investigate : - potential reduction ( vs Placebo ) number asthma exacerbation , time first event Ismigen® ; - potential decrease number respiratory tract infection observation period ( 3-month treatment 6-month follow-up ) treatment ; - specific change occur panel immunological marker result Ismigen® effect ( subset 48 patient ) .</detailed_description>
