	<brief_summary>This study design prove new method enable automated analysis esophageal electrocardiography ( eECG ) signal long-term measurement well detection atrial fibrillation . The investigator hypothesis eECG signal allow reliable atrial ventricular ECG signal distinction detection atrial fibrillation . Therefore 14 patient arrhythmias 6 cardiac healthy subject ask take part study . On subject esophageal ECG simultaneous standard surface ECG take half hour . Patient undergoing cardiac catheter ablation current hospitalization ask allow access invasively obtain measurement ( i.e . atrial potential map ) improve understand eECG signal .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background The fast correct diagnosis heart rhythm disorder important reduce morbidity mortality cardiovascular patient . Atrial fibrillation special interest , important cause devastate brain stroke . A significant number stroke cardioembolic genesis due paroxysmal atrial fibrillation diagnose early enough . Therefore , important detect atrial fibrillation soon possible . With oral anticoagulation effective therapeutic option available prevent cardioembolisms . In clinical routine , mostly 24-hour 7-day ECGs make look cardiac arrhythmia . The use device well establish . Nevertheless , side effects/limitations . Skin electrode use derivation ECG often cause skin irritation , sometimes leading premature termination recording . Because dryout contact gel ( cause artifact ) , small p-waves especially also motion artifact , trigger record semi-automatic analysis record problematic , longer record time semi-automatic analysis would helpful . As alternative esophageal electrocardiography perform . Signal quality ECG recording ( especially leave atrium ) well standard surface ECG vicinity esophagus leave atrium . The esophagus tolerate well foreign body investigator know long-term nasogastric intubation . Therefore use esophageal technique long-term rhythm monitoring interest promising alternative conventional surface Holter ECGs . Earlier study already show improved p-wave eECG signal , automatic semi-automatic wave analysis algorithms satisfactory . By increase number measuring channel esophageal catheter , new class algorithm apply order increase detection reliability . Using multiple channel increase quality result intuitive widely use method e.g . 12 lead ECG EECG , etc . Objective Primary Objective : Differentiation electrical atrial ventricular cardiac activity ( A/V classification ) Secondary Objective : Detection atrial fibrillation sequence ( AFib Detection ) Methods 20 subject include pilot study verify enhance multi-channel detection algorithm . In order cover wide variety arrhythmias test algorithm , subject select accord 4 category : 1 ) 4 patient intermit persist atrial fibrillation . 2 ) 4 patient atrial flutter 3 ) 6 patient frequent atrial ventricular extra-systoles . 4 ) 6 cardiac healthy subject . In total around 50'000 heart beat record . The surface ECG signal use reference ( manually analyze ) . Sensitivity specificity correctly detect atrial ventricular activity compare manual reference include 95 % confidence interval calculate ( A/V Classification ) . Additionally sensitivity specificity detect atrial fibrillation sequence include 95 % confidence interval calculate ( AFib Detection ) .</detailed_description>
