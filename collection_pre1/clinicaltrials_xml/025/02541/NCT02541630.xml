	<brief_title>Big Mind Veterans With PTSD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In recent year , intervention involve mindfulness become increasingly popular complementary mind-body therapeutic strategy variety medical psychiatric condition . Mindfulness describe practice focus attention moment-by-moment experience attitude curiosity , openness acceptance . In word , practice mindfulness simply experience present moment . During mindfulness , awareness focus external sensory input , internal sensation , proprioception pain , well awareness internal working mind . Mindfulness originate Buddhist spiritual practice . One Zen , traditional Buddhist approach primarily involve practice develop mindfulness way seat meditation . Two secular mindfulness-based intervention extensively study Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction ( MBSR ) Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy ( MBCT ) . MBSR develop Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn University Massachusetts Medical Center secular method utilize Buddhist mindfulness mainstream psychology medicine . MBSR include education stress well train cop strategy assertiveness addition mindfulness . MBCT develop Zindel Segal , Mark Williams John Teasdale . MBCT base upon MBSR combine principle cognitive therapy mindfulness prevent relapse depression . MBCT , like MBSR , utilize secular mindfulness technique include seated meditation . A large literature support effectiveness MBSR social anxiety disorder , generalize anxiety disorder , improved psychological functioning among individual medical disorder pain . Evidence indicate MBCT beneficial unipolar depression relapse prevention , generalize anxiety disorder , panic disorder , hypochondriasis social phobia . The strong evidence relapse prevention unipolar illness . Finally , recent review meta-analysis specifically address effectiveness MBSR MBCT ( similar intervention ) reduce symptom anxiety depression . The author conclude mindfulness base therapy improve symptom anxiety depression across wide range severity even symptom associate disorder . The mechanisms underlying effectiveness mindfulness intervention incompletely understood . However , considerable evidence suggest approach decrease depression anxiety , least part , alter self-referential thinking . For example , increase self-focused thinking associate affective symptom . Furthermore , strong evidence particular type think self contribute dysphoria general unipolar depression . Specifically , analytical self-focused rumination ( think analytically self symptom ) maladaptive . This cognitive style associate overgeneral autobiographical memory , global negative self-judgments , great negative future think dysphoria . Furthermore , compel evidence ruminative self-focus associate severity duration depressive symptom well relapse illness . In contrast analytic self-focus , mindfulness ( experiential self-focus ) adaptive . Therefore , intervention increase mindfulness and/or decrease analytical self-referential rumination may effective depressive anxiety symptom . In fact , study indicate mindfulness approach fact exert benefit result increase mindfulness decrease self-focused rumination . These intervention also promote additional cognitive change may help ameliorate symptom . One enhance compassion specifically include patience kindness direct toward self . Self-compassion predictor psychological health increase care one 's self appear contribute effectiveness intervention . There considerable evidence MBSR MBCT broad spectrum antianxiety antidepressant effect well generally enhance psychological functioning pain tolerance . Nonetheless , approach unlikely effective patient . Thus , need evaluate potential effectiveness mindfulness intervention . Further , effectiveness MBSR MBCT suggest mindfulness intervention may also beneficial study alternative approach warrant . Finally , compel need evaluate use mindfulness approach adjunctive intervention veteran posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . The purpose study pilot test feasibility use alternative mindfulness approach , Big Mind veterans PTSD seek complementary alternative treatment George E. Wahlen VAMC . Big Mind ( BM ) , develop Zen Master Dennis Genpo Merzel secular mindfulness self-discovery intervention integrate aspect Zen practice voice-dialogue method . Voice-dialog sometimes use therapeutic tool western psychology . The BM process guide individual shift perspective , particularly regard self-perception . BM facilitate self-discovery teaching participant become aware different aspect sense self give voice separate component . In word , BM facilitate become `` mindful '' aware one 's cognition emotion . Aspects self may cognitive construct , `` Controller , '' `` Skeptic , '' `` Self-Critic , '' `` Cheater '' `` Doubt '' emotional state , `` Fear , '' `` Anger , '' `` Joy '' `` Compassion '' sensation , `` Pain . '' During BM session , participant develop self-awareness speaking specific component , `` voice '' self , `` voice Fear . '' Temporarily assume identity aspect principle allows depth exploration cognition emotion associate particular construct . The investigator hypothesize process therapeutically useful facet associate negative trait ( e.g . Cheater ) unpleasant affect ( Fear ) may partially repress unacknowledged self . Bringing disowned voice light facilitates work cognition emotion constructive way . For example , one experience chronic symptom anxiety ( fear ) , tendency try avoid prevent unpleasant emotion . However , `` fear fear '' actually increase discomfort may result adoption maladaptive strategy , excessive substance use avoidance . Further , `` fear fear '' likely exacerbate anxiety increase baseline level fear perpetuate vicious cycle fear lead even great fear . BM offer unique approach give active voice fear . Thus , one able examine fear closely come recognize transient harmful . When one allow actively encourages experience fear , `` fear fear '' dissipates adaptive behavior strategy adopt . The BM process teach shift perspective , therefore provide mean escape cycle repetitive self-criticism unconscious behavioral pattern emotional response . This accomplish view one 's thought behavior neutral standpoint rather ego base self-focused perspective . Becoming `` mindful '' pattern facilitate take conscious control cognitive emotional response rather control . In addition decrease negative cognition emotion , investigator also hypothesize BM increase mindfulness decrease analytic self-referential thinking associate depression PTSD . One become le attached one 's self-concept well overall importance self . This change perception decrease need think self analytically increase one 's ability experience life ( mindfully ) . BM use extensively last decade method spiritual self-discovery . However , use clinical intervention . Scientific study conduct exception one publish study suggest effectiveness rapid spiritual intervention tool . This study also provide preliminary evidence BM process increase mindfulness decrease depression anxiety . Based evidence mindfulness intervention discuss , investigator hypothesize adjunctive BM group intervention decrease PTSD , mood anxiety symptom well increase physical pain tolerance among veteran PTSD . The Big Mind intervention present group format . There four group session ( 90 minute per group ) session occur weekly . Groups hold classroom group room George E. Wahlen VAMC . The number subject per intervention 5 - 10 . The intervention repeat maximum 30 subject enrol . Subjects give homework assignment complete group session . Each session include BM group practice review homework assignment . Study participant complete six instrument three time point assessment : 1 ) baseline assessment prior session one ; 2 ) mid-point assessment intervention ( end week 2 ) 3 ) post-intervention ( end week 4 ) . Attendance report adverse event collect throughout intervention . Subject feedback obtain post-intervention ( end week 4 ) .</detailed_description>
