	<brief_title>Fetal Effects Pre-Pregnancy Lifestyle Interventions Unexplained Infertility Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Via participation FIT-PLESE study ( RMN ) randomize 90 obese woman unexplained infertility 1:1 lifestyle modification program consist nutritionally balance caloric restriction ( 1200-1500 kcal/d ) , gastric lipase inhibitor ( Alli ) increase physical activity ( goal reach 10K steps/d ) ( NuPA ) versus increase physical activity alone ( PAo ) . The pre-pregnancy intervention last 16 week , goal 7 % weight loss NuPA arm . Weight physical activity monitor wireless device ( Fitbit Wireless Activity Tracker Fitbit Aria Wireless Activity Scale , respectively ) . Following 16 week pre-pregnancy intervention , randomize couple undergo standard treatment unexplained infertility , 3 cycle CC-IUI ( require ~3 month ) . The goal treatment group maintain level physical activity weight achieve pretreatment phase empiric infertility treatment phase . Women conceive follow throughout pregnancy wireless activity monitor wireless scale . Additionally three brief onsite visit pregnancy ( 16 , 24 32 week ) determination weight , waist circumference , glycemic measure ( fast glucose , insulin , HgbA1C ) , apolipoprotein lipid , blood pressure . Nutritional intake assess The Dietary Assessment Questionnaire Diet History Questionnaire II ( DHQ II ) , instrument choose FIT-PLESE investigator ( http : //appliedresearch.cancer.gov/dhq2/ ) . The primary outcome FIT-PLESE live-birth rate , birth weight , gestational age delivery , congenital anomaly rate . The subject inclusion exclusion criterion detail Human Subjects section . There overlap aim FIT-PLESE present R21 proposal . The three maternal fetal group proposal follow : FIT-PLESE participant ( University Pennsylvania Central IRB approve ) Group 1 : Nutritional/Physical Activity ( NuPA ) Intervention : Obese participant FIT-PLESE clinical trial randomize nutritional restriction /AlliTM/physical activity arm achieve pregnancy . Group 2 : Physical Activity ( PAo ) Intervention : Obese participant FIT-PLESE clinical trial randomize exercise arm achieve pregnancy . Control group ( University Oklahoma IRB approve ) Group 3 ( Infertile , non-lifestyle intervention control ) : Obese woman ( 60 ) unexplained infertility meet inclusion/exclusion criterion FIT-PLESE decline participation trial elect undergo CC-IUI treatment achieve pregnancy without prior diet exercise intervention . We extensive experience evaluate fetal morphometry woman participate prospective study design ass relationship maternal neonatal adiposity ( n=77 ) already undergone similar ultrasound biomarker measurement pregnancy OUHSC . The data collect analyzed . These non-diabetic woman uncomplicated pregnancy evenly distribute pre-pregnancy BMIs normal weight ( BMI &lt; 24.9 , n=23 ) , overweight ( BMI 25-29.9 , n=29 ) obese ( BMI 30 &gt; , n=25 ) . These woman conceive spontaneously undergo diet exercise intervention ( see preliminary data ) . We assess participant Group 1 , 2 3 prior pregnancy trimester 16 , 24 , 32 week gestational age mother conceive . We evaluate fetus conceive trimester pregnancy gestational age . We evaluate newborn within one week delivery body composition . All participant inclusion exclusion criterion .</detailed_description>
