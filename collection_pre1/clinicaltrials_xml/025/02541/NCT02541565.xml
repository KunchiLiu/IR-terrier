	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study side effect pembrolizumab combination chemotherapy treat patient previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma grade 3b follicular lymphoma . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab rituximab , may interfere ability cancer cell grow spread . Drugs use chemotherapy , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin hydrochloride , vincristine sulfate , prednisone , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving pembrolizumab together combination chemotherapy may better treatment diffuse large B-cell lymphoma follicular lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Combination Chemotherapy Treating Patients With Previously Untreated Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma Grade 3b Follicular Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To measure toxicity profile pembrolizumab ( MK-3475 ) co-administered full-course RCHOP ( rituximab , cyclophosphamide , doxorubicin hydrochloride , vincristine sulfate , prednisone ) subject previously untreated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess clinical outcome include response rate , event-free survival , overall survival MK-3475 + RCHOP induction subject previously untreated DLBCL . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To measure baseline expression protein program death-1 ( PD-1 ) family tumor cell coexist immune infiltrates , use archival tissue available . II . To measure peripheral blood T cell subset treatment use flow cytometry , measure baseline vitamin D ( 25-hydroxy , total ) . III . To explore relationship parameter likelihood response therapy outcomes . OUTLINE : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 prednisone orally ( PO ) day 1-5 . Patients also receive rituximab IV , cyclophosphamide IV , doxorubicin hydrochloride IV , vincristine sulfate IV day 2 course 1 day 1 subsequent course . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 5 year .</detailed_description>
