	<brief_summary>The propose study evaluate tolerability , acceptability potential efficacy minocycline treatment co-occurring opioid amphetamine-type stimulant ( ATS ) dependence . In proposed clinical trial , patient first discontinue illicit opioid ATS induct onto buprenorphine maintenance treatment ( BMT ) inpatient ward department psychiatry begin receive minocycline . Tolerability acceptability evaluate assess rate patient retention treatment , patient satisfaction treatment adverse effect treatment . The potential efficacy minocycline evaluate regard primary outcome measure : reduction ATS use , base urine toxicology test self-report . Secondary outcome measure include retention , reduction HIV risk behavior improvements functional status .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Additional data available project come contemporaneous historical drug treatment clinical trial treatment program conduct HUSM similar population patient proposed/described component cluster research project describe overall Research University Team Grant proposal . Comparisons treatment process outcome measure collect propose clinical trial data collect contemporaneous historical control enhance ability evaluate potential efficacy minocycline treatment agent co-occurring opioid amphetamine-type stimulant ( ATS ) dependence . Data patient receive drug treatment HUSM use reference point evaluate potential effect size treatment effect associate minocycline treatment . The preliminary data treatment retention data , patient satisfaction , potential adverse effect , efficacy use preliminary/pilot research design apply fund support future large scale randomize clinical trial aim development effective medically base treatment opiate ATS abuse dependence . Over past decade , amphetamine-type stimulant ( ATS ) also emerge major drug problem . Globally , ATS second commonly use illicit drug type widely use heroin . ATS abuse especially prevalent problematic Asian region , ATS production , use , drug seizure , demand treatment continued increase . Injection methamphetamine report Malaysia ( Chawarski et al , 2006 ) south-east Asian country ( McKetin , 2008 ) . In recent survey out-of-treatment heroin IVDU city across Malaysia , 60 % report current ATS use , 29 % inject ATS ( Chawarski et al , 2012 ) . ATS use associate increased HIV transmission behavioral risk . The connection heroin , methamphetamine HIV Malaysia well document ( Chawarski et al , 2006 ) . Increased needle share risky sexual behavior lead increase prevalence HIV infection . ATS use exacerbate HIV transmission risk number mechanism : ATS user report engage frequent risky sexual behavior use ATS frequent needle sharing . ATS also associate impairment mood executive functioning may persist prolonged period may contribute relapse drug use , thus problem . Drug abuse major problem Kelantan past several decade ( Suarn &amp; NorAdam,1993 ) ATS gain momentum past decade . The number individual arrest annually ATS Kelantan increase past 5 year 2900 2007 5300 2010 . For past 5 year , Kelantan also lead Malaysia high population prevalence HIV infection , 47 per 100,000 2008 , nearly 4 time prevalence report rest Malaysia . Kelantan also high number woman HIV Malaysia 1200 report 2008 , suggest HIV make transition general population . A large proportion treatment seek drug user Kelantan HIV positives susceptible high mortality ( JKNK , 2012 ) . Minocycline broad-spectrum antibiotic derive tetracycline . Minocycline substantially lipid-soluble tetracycline , thus minocycline readily cross blood-brain barrier , potential efficacy treat ATS dependence derive effect dopamine glutamate neurotransmission brain anti-inflammatory , neuro-protective cognitive-enhancing effect brain ( Dean et al , 2012 ) . Glutamate along dopamine play key role reward addictive effect amphetamine , methamphetamine , stimulant . Input glutamatergic pathway brain reward center enhance dopaminergic transmission pathway reward . Blockade glutamate receptor region prevents many behavioral effect ATS stimulants prevents reinstatement stimulant use animal study . Glutamate play key role learn memory , blockade glutamate interfere consolidation memory reward effect stimulant . Minocycline , one medication affect glutamate transmission , attenuate many behavioral effect stimulant animal model , attenuate release dopamine brain reward pathways response stimulant . It cognitive-enhancing effect human , improve stimulant-induced phencyclidine-induced cognitive impairment . In animal model , minocycline improve stimulant-induced phencyclidine-induced impairment object recognition , sensorimotor gating , visuospatial memory . A study nicotine addiction show great reduction crave cigarette minocycline compare placebo ( Sofuoglu et al , 2009 ) . In another study ( Sofuoglu et al , 2011 ) , minocycline attenuate subjective , reward effect amphetamine administration healthy human volunteer , reduce plasma cortisol level follow amphetamine administration , improve reaction time cognitive performance task test attention . The cognitive-enhancing effect minocycline find individual schizophrenia , show improved working memory , cognitive flexibility cognitive planning response minocycline . Addition minocycline early treatment improve negative symptom patient schizophrenia ( Chaudry et al , 2012 ) .Minocycline exerts neuroprotective effect certain circumstance , also neurotoxic consequence ( Plane et al , 2010 ) . Reserchers Japan report case female patient whose psychotic symptom methamphetamine use disorder successfully improve minocycline , even though precise mechanism understood ( Tanibuchi et al , 2010 ) . Very rarely , minocycline associate severe problem , include colitis , infection non-susceptible organism , liver damage , ( MacNeil et al,1997 ) , benign intracranial hypertension , skin rash , autoimmune disorder allergic reaction . Although problem occur rarely , plan monitor patient adverse effect closely throughout study ensure early detection prompt treatment serious advere effect , one occur . Additionally , patient treat acne minocycline may treat minocycline many year , propose study plan treat patient minocycline limited period , 4 month . We anticipate , find efficacious treat ATS abuse dependence , minocycline would use initial phase treatment help patient consolidate period abstinence ATS develop healthy , drug-free life style ; anticipate minocycline would use long-term maintenance treatment ATS abuse dependence . In addition detoxification treatment medication , manual-guided educational drug HIV risk reduction counseling ( EDRC ) provide participant . EDRC provide education medical understanding opioid ATS addiction , highly effective strategy use successful drug recovery effort , medical harmful consequence drug use includingHIV infectious disease transmission , well effective prevention negative consequence illicit drug use ( Chawarski et al , 2008 ) . It help patient remain treatment , adhere prescribed medication , abstain reduce illicit opioid ATS use HIV risk behavior , make life-style change foster sustained recovery . It also teach basic cognitive behavioral cop skill increase patient ' chance reach sustain prolonged recovery drug . For HIV positive patient , EDRC encourage patient attend HIV clinic adhere monitoring , medication , treatment recommendation . EDRC provide train supervised nursing personnel , drug counselor , therapist . It offer individual format frequency range 3 time per week detoxification per week outpatient phase treatment .</detailed_description>
