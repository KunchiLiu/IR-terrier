	<brief_summary>The primary objective pilot trial evaluate feasibility 12 week vs. 24 week field-based directly observe therapy ( DOT ) HCV therapy resource-limited setting . The investigator compare treatment completion rate among 50 person chronically infect HCV randomize receive either 1 ) 12 week sofosbuvir ( SOF ) + ribavirin ( RBV ) + pegylated interferon alfa-2a ( PEG ) ; 2 ) 24 week SOF + RBV . Treatment deliver daily field worker location participant choose . Secondary objective 1 ) To compare efficacy SOF+RBV without PEG measure proportion subject sustain viral response 12 week discontinuation therapy ( SVR12 ) ; 2 ) To evaluate safety tolerability SOF+RBV without PEG ; 3 ) To assess impact SVR12 insulin resistance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This non-blinded randomized clinical trial 50 participant randomize 1:1 allocation ratio one two treatment arm . Arm 1 : Sofosbuvir ( 400mg/daily ) + Pegylated Interferon alfa-2a ( 180µg/weekly ) + Ribavirin ( 800mg/daily ) 12 week Arm 2 : Sofosbuvir ( 400mg/daily ) + Ribavirin ( 800mg/daily ) 24 week Pegylated-interferon alfa-2a ( PEG ) deliver subcutaneously weekly . Sofosbuvir ( SOF ) ribavirin ( RBV ) take orally daily entire study period . The study take place YR Gaitonde Centre AIDS Research Education ( YRGCARE ) . YRG CARE non-profit medical research institution Chennai . YRGCARE Medical Centre provide medical care 18,000 person HIV disease . Currently 8000 person receive highly active antiretroviral therapy center . Participants recruit YR Gaitonde Centre Substance Abuse Research ( YRGCSAR ) , affiliate YRGCARE . The investigator primarily recruit subject cohort study current former people inject drug ( PWID ) ongoing center . Eligible participant randomize one two treatment arm provide write informed consent . Treatment deliver directly participant daily field worker location participant choose . Participants ask visit study clinic every four week treatment 12 week complete treatment additional study procedure . In addition , participant Arm 1 ask visit clinic every week receive PEG injection . The primary outcome treatment completion .
