	<brief_title>Mirtazapine Treatment Co-Occurring Opioid ATS Dependence Malaysia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Amphetamine type stimulant ( ATS ) opioid abuse , dependence injection drug use ( IDU ) major public health problem Malaysia nearby country ( include China , Indonesia , Thailand , Vietnam , Myamar , Cambodia ) major driver HIV/AIDS epidemic countries.1 Opioids ( predominantly heroin , morphine , , less extent , opium ) primary drug abuse drug user Malaysia region . There 300,000 register drug user Malaysia ( estimate &gt; 500,000 total ) ; opioid dependent current IDUs ; 25-30 % IDUs infect HIV ; IDU account 70 % HIV infection Malaysia ( 91,360 register HIV+ 1986 2010 ) .6 Over past decade , ATS also emerge additional major drug problem . Globally , ATS second commonly use illicit drug type ( marijuana ) widely use heroin.1-6 , 2 ATS abuse especially prevalent problematic Asian region , ATS production , use , drug seizure , demand treatment , medical consequence continue increase recent 2011 report . Laboratories produce ATS identify half country region ; large scale laboratory capable industrial-scale manufacture find Malaysia , China , Indonesia . Injection methamphetamine report Malaysia , Indonesia , Thailand , Singapore . Data recently complete study others document rapid rise prevalence ATS use among opioid IDUs past decade ; recent survey out-of-treatment heroin IDUs city across Malaysia , 60 % report current ATS use , 29 % inject ATS . ATS use associate increased behavioral risk HIV transmission ( even already high risk opioid IDUs ) , In early study conduct Malaysia , find increase prevalence HIV , increase needle share risky sexual behavior among opiate dependent IDUs also report lifetime use , compare opioid IDUs use ATS . ATS use also associate poor anti-retroviral medication adherence . ATS use exacerbate HIV transmission risk number mechanism : ATS user report engage frequent risky sexual behavior use ATS3 , frequent IDU equipment share . ATS use may enhance sexual desire , effect many opiate dependent individual ( individual maintain MMT ) may particularly desire opioid-induced hypogonadism result loss libido . ATS also associate impairment mood executive functioning may persist prolonged period may contribute relapse drug use , IDU , high risk behavior . Consequently , critical develop evaluate treatment reduce opioid ATS use , IDU , HIV transmission risk among individual COATS . Located northeastern region peninsular Malaysia , border Thailand , Kota Bharu , densely populate fast growing capital city Kelantan state site propose study , provide unique opportunity conduct propose study . Kota Bharu Kelantan experience severe problem illicit opioid ATS use , IDU HIV Malaysia . The number individual arrest annually ATS Kelantan increase past 5 year 2900 2007 5300 2010 . For past 5 year , Kelantan also lead Malaysia high population prevalence HIV infection ( 47 per 100,000 2008 , nearly 4 time prevalence report rest Malaysia ) . Kelantan also high number woman HIV Malaysia ( 1200 report 2008 ) , suggest HIV make transition general population . A large proportion treatment seek drug user Kelantan HIV + susceptible high mortality : Since MMT first introduce Kelantan 2006 , 623 1128 ( 53 % ) MMT patient know HIV status HIV+ , 126 1148 patient enrol MMT die follow enrollment [ Personal communication , Dr. Hazura BT Mat Zubir , Kelantan Health Department , December 5 , 2011 ] . Currently , proven efficacious medication treat Amphetamine type stimulant ( ATS ) dependence co-occurring opioid ATS dependence ( COATS ) . Although opioid agonist maintenance treatment ( OMT ) methadone buprenorphine efficacious treat opioid dependence reduce HIV transmission risk , many patient continue opioid ATS use HIV risk behavior OMT , overall good efficacy OMT substantially reduce patient COATS . Patients COATS also particularly high risk HIV infection transmission due drug- sex-related behaviour . Pharmacology Mirtazapine Mirtazapine novel antidepressant agent act antagonist inhibitory alpha 2 adrenergic presynaptic receptor alpha 2 heteroreceptors serotenergic nerve terminal . Mirtazapine increase norepinephrine release selective serotonergic ( 5-HT1A ) transmission act antagonist alpha 2 adrenergic presynaptic receptor result increase norepinephrine release act alpha 2 heteroreceptors serotonergic nerve terminal increase serotonin release . Mirtazapine selectively act 5-HT1A neurotransmission block 5-HT2 5-HT3 receptor . It also enhance frontocortical release dopaminergic transmission via 5-HT1A activation dopamine release prefrontal cortex via blockage alpha 2 adrenergic 5HT2C receptor . Mirtazapine initially evaluate potential treatment ATS withdrawal base pharmacological effect norepinephrine , serotonin dopamine neurotransmissions effectively show treat sleep problem , anxiety depression . Recent study human animal evidence mirtazapine promising role treat ATS dependence . Two small pilot 2,4 show mirtazapine improve sleep reduced ATS withdrawal symptom . Another study 5 show mirtazapine effective Modafinil improve sleep ATS withdrawal symptom . Preclinical study animal provide additional support potential efficacy mirtazapine treat ATS dependence . Cue elicit drug crave important mechanism underlie relapse follow abstinence modulation brain involve limbic reward region mediate glutaminergic dopaminergic neurotransmission . Studies animal model show mirtazapine block cue elicit behavioural response believe due modulation effect mirtazapine noradrenergic serotonergis system . Repeated mirtazapine treatment eliminate ATS-induced conditioned place preference rat suggest may disrupt ATS associated memory consolidation reconsolidation follow exposure . Mirtazapine one promise medication treatment ATS dependence 's preliminary efficacy show double blind , randomize , placebo control clinical trial . The study conduct 60 actively use , ATS dependent men sex men ( MSM ) , find addition mirtazapine substance abuse counsel decreased ATS use sexual risk behaviour . Mirtazapine safe drug serious adverse effect . Potential adverse effect Mirtazapine include decrease appetite , weight loss , insomnia , nausea vomiting , diarrhoea , urinary retention , increase body temperature , excessive sweating , pupil dilation , sexual dysfunction . Despite promising preliminary result initial study , date publish replication study clinical trial mirtazapine treat ATS dependence different population setting . The propose study provide additional data tolerability , acceptability potential efficacy Mirtazapine treatment co-occurring opioid ATS dependence ( COATS ) Kelantan , Malaysia .</detailed_description>
