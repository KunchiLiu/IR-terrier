	<brief_summary>The purpose study two-fold : first , observe effect one session repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) error-prediction ability patient obsessive compulsive disorder ( OCD ) well healthy individual ; second , observe clinical effect 10 session rTMS patient OCD .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Use Magnetic Brain Stimulation Treat Obsessive Compulsive Disorder , Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A battery cognitive task design selectively measure several aspect anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) function , administer one session rTMS participant . The first neurocognitive session administer separate day rTMS session . The second neurocognitive session perform immediately rTMS day . Participants perform five task design test : error processing , error likelihood assessment , meta-memory , response inhibition , affect recognition . The rTMS paradigm consist four short train magnetic pulse include 5 minute stimulation 1Hz frequency ( overall 1200 pulse one session ) intensity 110 % participant 's motor threshold , 2 minute interval stimulation train . Stimulation apply dorsal ACC ( dACC ) use double-cone rTMS coil . dACC precisely target use neuronavigation software load high resolution MRI subject ' brain . OCD patient go receive two week ( 10 session ) daily rTMS treatment use protocol describe .</detailed_description>
