	<brief_summary>Patients treatment benign intracranial hypertension undergo two test routinely perform patient : central corneal thickness axial length eye . The data obtain measurement assess see correlate aspect vision loss include visual acuity , visual field status , optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) result , fundus photograph .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Axial Length Central Corneal Thickness Benign Intracranial Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients benign intracranial hypertension would identify diagnosis general ophthalmic neurologic patient population Ochsner Health System . All would baseline eye examination visual field optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) testing , standard step manage patient condition . Two measurement would take minimal risk patient would normally do baseline exam : central corneal thickness axial length . These procedure routinely do patient glaucoma , corneal disease , cataracts without significant risk injury . The theoretical risk central corneal thickness axial length measurement A-scan ultrasonography relate small risk transmission infection corneal abrasion due probe touch cornea . These test would perform charge patient would significantly increase time ocular examination . Patients would neuro-imaging study lumbar puncture confirm diagnosis benign intracranial hypertension standard part work condition independent research study . The author statistically analyze standard measure visual field function health nerve fiber layer OCT see propose risk factor correlate deterioration visual function . Data would continue collect follow visit relate visual field OCT would normally perform standard visit condition . The measurement central corneal thickness axial length would perform solely time enrollment study since measurement change time .</detailed_description>
