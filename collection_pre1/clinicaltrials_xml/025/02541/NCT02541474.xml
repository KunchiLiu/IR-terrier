	<brief_summary>There urgent need develop new care model patient long-term complex need . Our goal service seamless , pro-active person-oriented . Intervention : The Patient-centered health care team ( PACT ) service model frail elderly patient multiple long term condition . PACT seamless proactive health service model aim ensure safe early discharge prevent hospital admission elderly frail patient . The four pivotal element support theoretical empirical underpinnings : 1 ) Goal-oriented person center approach 2 ) Inter-disciplinary comprehensive geriatric team : 3 ) Pro-active care plan . Study Objective : 1 ) To investigate whether PACT model improve health-related quality life patient generate goal 2 ) carry health economic evaluation PACT . Design : The evaluation model complex intervention guide evaluation framework . This non-randomized , match control , study . The intervention unit , care organization , include four hospital - municipality dyad . Two intervention dyad two control dyad . Index patient intervention hospital match age , sex number chronic condition . Intervention group : Patients emergency admission UNN internal medicine department Tromsø Harstad age &gt; 65 , three long-term condition , emergency admission within last year , informed consent give patient next kin . ( Approved ethic board 07.05.2015 ) . The exclusion criterion : Language barrier , less 3 month life expectancy . Controls : Recruited Nordlanssykehuset ( Bodø ) UNN-Narvik internal medicine department , match index patient 's sex , age , number long-term condition . Control patient subject data-collection intervention patient . Data collection : All patient data collect baseline , 6 12 month . Outcomes : The primary outcome adjust difference change Quality Life , measure Short Form-36 ( SF-36 ) , physical health dimension intervention control group 6 month inclusion study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The PAtient-Centred Team - Effectiveness Cost-effectiveness Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Paradoxically , success health care system cause number patient multiple rise . Studies European population 75 year age show LTC-prevalences 70 % , rate multimorbidity around 40-50 % ( 8-10 ) . Patients LTC-conditions account 3/4ths health care spend early US report , patient 4 co-morbidities consume 5 time much health service LTC recent Irish report . The current care system design deliver disease specific , urgent/ episodic care , poorly suit need grow patient group Best practice model patient Long Term condition ( LTCs ) complex need develop . In medicine , underlie model often implicit , cause misunderstand medical research practical , factual theory drive . In complex intervention , underpin theoretical model consider essential study design.. In plan design intervention , investigator choose use Chronic Care Model ( CCM ) . Other model chronic care either slightly overlap alignment CCM , none cover area CCM . It model systems- clinical- patient perspective . Furthermore grow evidence base effect care-processes , health outcome cost-effectiveness . It continue inspire care reform large international care organization , local northern Norwegian context . The CCM build two pillar : `` The informed active patient '' `` The pro-active prepared health care team '' , equal partner engage `` productive interaction '' `` health functional outcome '' . Evidence Based Medicine ( EBM ) basis identification appropriate action . Integrated team care delivery tailor patient ' need , value preference . Both health management support use clinical information system include model key support factor ( 33 ) . A recent report document health care delivery Helse Nord far ideal CCM-care . The main challenge lack attention patient 's personal context priority , fragment care delivery . A large-scale CCM inspire project answer challenge , development university Hospital North Norway ( UNN ) . Its dual focus coordination care two core component : 1 ) proactive , prepare interdisciplinary team personnel hospital municipality address current fragment care delivery 2 ) inform active patient approach care planning . The initiative , fund redeploy exist staff work team . The team facilitate patient center integrate care conduct structure person center need assessment , develop individual evidence base care plan , provide service integration across level care . Research question , hypotheses method The CCM currently establish best practice LTC-care delivery . Yet , evidence effectiveness CCM term health functional outcome several systematic review remain inconsistent . All CCM intervention , must tailor CCM local historical , cultural regulatory context . Thus heterogeneity CCM-interventions large , may explain observed inconsistency . In review , investigator note many CCM-interventions seem lose link underlie theory operationalization process . Active two-way patient-provider dialogue practical skill development self-management central good outcome . However `` informed active patient '' `` self-management support '' often translate passive one-way educational intervention . Furthermore , content many CCM-interventions often inadequately describe , make difficult ascertain fidelity underlie theory . Our research question : What effect theory drive CCM-implementation : - Patient health functional outcome ? - System outcome : Length stay emergency admission primary and/ secondary care institution ? Material method : Design : The evaluation model complex intervention guide evaluation framework . This non-randomized , match control , study ( 46 ) . The investigator recognize randomization robust method avoid systematic bias comparison group . However , intervention aim change usual geriatric care , term structure routine organizational level two municipal-hospital dyad . A patient level randomization require organization switch old `` usual care '' new team-based pro-active routine patient-by-patient basis , unlikely successful . As four hospital involve study , randomization organizational level would really control bias either . The chosen design improve comparability comparison group match factor know important outcome ( age , sex number chronic condition ) , adjust baseline difference population before-after design , adjust know confounders propensity score method ( 47 , 48 ) . The design approve Cochrane include systematic review intervention ( 46 ) . Setting : Trials often perform select patient without comorbidities make study suffer limited external validity . Van Royen et al ( 2014 ) argue drive demand real-word clinical practice data . In project , team member develop intervention part daily activity hospital include `` normal '' medical patient &gt; 67 , make trial set naturalistic . The real-world setting normal patient caseload make design resemble usual care , thus increase generalizability trial patient regular practice . A naturalistic setting view gold standard economic evaluation , also objective project . The intervention : PACT seamless proactive health service model aim ensure safe early discharge prevent hospital admission elderly frail patient . The four pivotal element part CCM-model , support theoretical empirical underpinnings : 1 ) Inter-disciplinary comprehensive geriatric team : Frail elderly patient often multi-morbid , need multiple simultaneous competency . The team push early discharge minimize deconditioning iatrogenic risk associate hospitalization ( . The team identify eligible patient 's , make integrated assessment need upon admission , marshal necessary resource resolve current clinical issue , prepare early discharge support home base service home -monitoring , -care . The team develop use different intervention option case management , discharge- follow-up protocol , array telehealth option ( telephone support , telemedicine , telemonitoring smart home solution ) combine in-person home visit need . Patients remain team responsibility period 3-5 day discharge 2 ) Involving patient care self-management : When clinical situation stable , patient invite make systematic assessment need , value preference care-team member . The patient 's wish translate realistic care goal share decision make process . Most importantly , team avoid undesired care , especially important palliative phase . The team also provide opportunity patient education , social- physical adaption , and/or skill train improve self-management . Patient involvement engagement care show improve health functional outcome . 3 ) Pro-active care plan : CCM promote systematic early identification functional decline . The team discus probable scenario clinical deterioration , provide action plan , available patient team . An example provide patient Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease drug kit , patient use guidance care personnel . The pro-active care plan also include road map towards health goal identify together patient . 4 ) One point contact : To avoid unnecessary delay prompt action early sign clinical problem , patient `` hunt '' right professional . A 24/ 7 call-center one-point- contact . The call center resource mobilize necessary clinical response , include single member of- completely comprehensive geriatric team .</detailed_description>
