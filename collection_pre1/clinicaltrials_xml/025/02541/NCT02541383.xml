	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Daratumumab Transplant Eligible Participants With Previously Untreated Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , open-label ( identity assign treatment know participant study staff ) , 2-arm ( 2 treatment group ) , multicenter study daratumumab participant diagnose previously untreated Multiple Myeloma eligible high dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplantation ( transplantation bone marrow ) . Participants randomize ( assigned chance ) one 2 treatment group either receive daratumumab plus bortezomib , thalidomide dexamethasone bortezomib , thalidomide dexamethasone induction ( transplantation ) consolidation ( transplantation ) treatment . All responder re-randomized ( assigned chance ) one 2 treatment group receive maintenance treatment daratumumab observation ( treatment ) . The study include 28-Day Screening Phase , Treatment Phase 6 treatment cycle ( cycle 4 week duration total period 30 week ) , Follow Phase 2 year . The total duration participant study approximately 138 week . The end study occur approximately 5 year last participant randomize second phase study . Disease assessment perform every 4 week first phase study every 8 week second phase study . Safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
