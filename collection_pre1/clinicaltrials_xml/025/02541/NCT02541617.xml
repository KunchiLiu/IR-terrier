	<detailed_description>The propose outcome study prospective , randomize , multicenter , single blind , non-inferiority clinical trial compare safety efficacy deep brain stimulation therapy apply community-based model 62 subject Parkinson 's disease appropriate STN DBS therapy . Eight community-based private neurology practice network Vanderbilt University Medical Center ( VUMC ) . Neurologists practice attend structure educational program offer Medtronic identification , selection , management Parkinson 's disease patient DBS therapy . Following educational program , practice identify subject implantation VUMC . Following screen baseline visit VUMC , appropriate patient implanted bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulating therapy . The initial post-operative programming do VUMC four week implantation . 8 subject equally randomize half follow long-term management community-based neurologist . The half follow VUMC . All subsequent outpatient evaluation management medication deep brain stimulation manage per standard care location assign randomization , community-based private neurology practice VUMC . All subject enrol first 24 month study . Follow-up evaluation 12 month perform VUMC . Each patient identify community-based neurologist implantation assess VUMC . This assessment include videotape UPDRS III rating , neuropsychological testing , appropriateness outline patient selection educational program . Patients implanted bilateral subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation therapy within 120 day initial assessment . The initial post-operative programming perform four week post-operatively , standard care . Subjects randomize either manage community-based neurologist VUMC . Follow-up evaluation 12 month include videotaped UPDRS rating neuropsychological testing , anti-parkinson medication dosage , quality life measure .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients must clinical diagnosis probable idiopathic PD . The diagnosis base upon presence least three four clinical feature accord diagnostic utility ( Resting Tremor , Bradykinesia , Rigidity , Asymmetric Onset ) absence clinical feature suggestive alternative diagnosis . 2 . Demonstrated response dopaminergic therapy . In order exclude patient possible alternative diagnosis , subject include study must demonstrate good response DA drug , define demonstrate least 30 % improvement parkinsonian motor sign , base upon UPDRS motor examination subscore , follow administration DA drug ( ) screen neurological examination . 3 . Advanced Parkinson 's disease . 4 . No contraindication surgery . 5 . Age 50 75 year old . 6 . Available followup entire duration study . 7 . Informed Consent : The subject understands risk , benefit , alternative study procedure participation study . 8 . MRI within normal range age 1 . Evidence alternative diagnosis secondary parkinsonism , suggest feature unusual early clinical course : Prominent postural instability , freeze phenomenon , hallucination unrelated medication first 3 year symptom onset ; dementia precede motor symptom ; supranuclear gaze palsy ( restriction upward gaze ) slow vertical saccade first year ; severe , symptomatic dysautonomia unrelated medication ; documentation condition know produce parkinsonism plausibly connect subject 's symptom ( suitably locate focal brain lesion neuroleptic use within past 6 month ) 2 . Uncontrolled medical condition clinically significant medical disease would increase risk develop pre postoperative complication ( e.g. , significant cardiac pulmonary disease , uncontrolled hypertension ) . 3 . Evidence dementia 4 . Major psychiatric disorder 5 . Previous brain operation injury . 6 . Active participation another clinical trial treatment PD . 7 . Patients demand cardiac pacemaker medical condition require repeat MRI scan .</criteria>
