	<brief_summary>The propose study evaluate tolerability , acceptability potential efficacy paliparidone treatment co-occurring opioid amphetamine-type stimulant ( ATS ) dependence . In proposed clinical trial , patient first discontinue illicit opioid ATS induct onto buprenorphine maintenance treatment ( BMT ) inpatient ward department psychiatry begin receive paliparidone . Tolerability acceptability evaluate assess rate patient retention treatment , patient satisfaction treatment adverse effect treatment . The potential efficacy paliparidone evaluate regard primary outcome measure : reduction illicit ATS use , base urine toxicology test self-report . Secondary outcome measure include treatment retention , reduction HIV risk behavior improvements functional status .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>An Open-label Study Oral Paliparidone Treatment Patients With Co-occurring Opioid ATS Dependence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malaysia struggle fight drug addiction country ( NADI , 2005 ) . Opioids predominantly heroin morphine ATS ( Chawarski et al , 2006 ) . dependence primary drug abuse drug user Malaysia There 300,000 register drug user Malaysia , opioid dependent current intravenous drug user ( IVDU ) . Drug abuse come together medical social problem , 25-30 % IVDU infect HIV ; IVDU account 70 % HIV infection Malaysia . There 90 , 000 register HIV positive 1986 2010 . ( National Anti-Drug Agency Malaysia , 2010 ) . Over past decade , amphetamine-type stimulant ( ATS ) also emerge major drug problem . Globally , ATS second commonly use illicit drug type widely use heroin . ATS abuse especially prevalent problematic Asian region , ATS production , use , drug seizure , demand treatment continued increase . Injection methamphetamine report Malaysia ( Chawarski et al , 2006 ) south-east Asian country ( McKetin , 2008 ) . In recent survey out-of-treatment heroin IVDU city across Malaysia , 60 % report current ATS use , 29 % inject ATS ( Chawarski et al , 2012 ) . ATS use associate increased HIV transmission behavioral risk . The connection heroin , methamphetamine HIV Malaysia well document ( Chawarski et al , 2006 ) . Increased needle share risky sexual behavior lead increase prevalence HIV infection . ATS use exacerbate HIV transmission risk number mechanism : ATS user report engage frequent risky sexual behavior use ATS frequent needle sharing . ATS also associate impairment mood executive functioning may persist prolonged period may contribute relapse drug use , thus problem . Drug abuse major problem Kelantan past several decade ( Suarn &amp; NorAdam,1993 ) ATS gain momentum past decade . The number individual arrest annually ATS Kelantan increase past 5 year 2900 2007 5300 2010 . For past 5 year , Kelantan also lead Malaysia high population prevalence HIV infection , 47 per 100,000 2008 , nearly 4 time prevalence report rest Malaysia . Kelantan also high number woman HIV Malaysia 1200 report 2008 , suggest HIV make transition general population . A large proportion treatment seek drug user Kelantan HIV positives susceptible high mortality ( JKNK , 2012 ) . Paliperidone , primary active metabolite risperidone , long-acting atypical neuroleptic ( antipsychotic ) medication . It block dopamine 2 ( D2 ) receptor serotonin 2A receptor act alpha2 antagonist . Blockade D2 receptor may reduce reinforce effect ATS stimulant ; blockade serotonin 2A receptor lead increase DA release prefrontal cortex motor region may thus improve cognitive performance mood reduce motor impairment associate blockade D2 receptor ; alpha2 antagonist action may provide antidepressant effect . Paliperidone 's potential efficacy treat ATS dependence suggest potential blocking attenuate reward effect ATS use potential improving cognitive functioning patient recover ATS dependence . An open label pilot study oral risperidone treatment methamphetamine dependence provide preliminary evidence safety , tolerability potential efficacy risperidone . Risperidone generally well-tolerated associate decreased methamphetamine use improvement fine motor function mood . A subsequent open trial injectable ripseridone find injectable risperidone associate reduction methamphetamine use improvement verbal memory . However date publish replication study study paliperidone treat ATS dependence population set . This propose pilot study paliperidone treatment ATS dependence would extend work provide specific data regard tolerability efficacy paliperidone opioid-agonist maintain patient co-occurring ATS opioid dependence ( COATS ) . In addition detoxification treatment medication , manual-guided educational drug HIV risk reduction counseling ( EDRC ) provide participant . EDRC provide education medical understanding opioid ATS addiction , highly effective strategy use successful drug recovery effort , medical harmful consequence drug use include HIV infectious disease transmission , well effective prevention negative consequence illicit drug use ( Chawarski et al , 2008 ) . It help patient remain treatment , adhere prescribed medication , abstain reduce illicit opioid ATS use HIV risk behavior , make life-style change foster sustained recovery . It also teach basic cognitive behavioral cop skill increase patient ' chance reach sustain prolonged recovery drug . For HIV positive patient , EDRC encourage patient attend HIV clinic adhere monitoring , medication , treatment recommendation . EDRC provide train supervised nursing personnel , drug counselor , therapist . It offer individual format frequency range 3 time per week detoxification per week outpatient phase treatment .</detailed_description>
