	<brief_summary>Intravenous iron preparation show superior oral iron largely replace treatment anaemia Northern country . However , socio-economic medical condition low resource country greatly differ northern country . Patients ' different access medication supply , perception medication need compliance well burden concomitant disease like malaria , soil-transmitted helminth , schistosomiasis , HIV red blood cell ( RBC ) genetic disorder may influence effectiveness safety iron substitution modality . The aim present study compare iv iron substitution ferric carboxymaltose ( FerinjectÂ® ) per oral iron substitution low resource country</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IV Ferric Carboxymaltose Compared With Oral Iron Treatment Iron Deficiency Anemia Delivery Tanzania</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study follow : Primary objective : To assess superiority term effectiveness iv iron substitution ferric carboxymaltose versus per oral iron substitution woman iron deficient anemia delivery Tanzania . Secondary objectives - To evaluate safety feasibility intravenous ferric carboxymaltose substitution compare per oral iron substitution resource limit country - To evaluate acceptance intravenous ferric carboxymaltose substitution compare per oral iron substitution resource limit country - To evaluate wellbeing woman receive intravenous ferric carboxymaltose compare woman receive per oral iron substitution - To evaluate sensitivity diagnosis iron deficiency measure hemoglobin , mean corpuscular volume ( MCV ) mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration ( MCHC ) , compare diagnosis measure iron metabolism parameter resource limited country</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Women close delivery Screening perform use HemoCue System . In case anemia , define Hg &lt; 110 g/l , venous puncture perform blood analyze 5 population analyzer erythrocyte index Reticulocyte index ferritin determine . Then If anemia define Hg &lt; 110 g/l confirm ferritin 50 ng/ml , patient include present study Patient compliance geographic proximity allow proper stag followup Patient must give write informed consent registration Active malaria ; patient test malaria Rapid Diagnostic Test microscopy positive treat . Patient treat malaria include Helminthic infection ; patient test helminthic infection stool ovum parasite exam positive treat single oral dose 400 mg albendazole . Treated patient include . HIV positivity . Patients test positive refer Care Treatment Clinic Bagamoyo District Hospital exclude study . Known hemoglobinopathy CReactive protein ( CRP ) &gt; 20 Patients chronic fever Psychiatric disorder preclude understanding information trial related topic give informed consent Concurrent treatment experimental drug treatment another clinical trial within 30 day prior trial entry Any serious underlying medical condition ( judgment investigator ) could impair ability patient participate trial Known allergy hypersensitivity study drug .</criteria>
