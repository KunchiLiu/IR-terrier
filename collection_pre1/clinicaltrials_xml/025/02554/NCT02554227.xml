	<brief_summary>Spondylodiscitis infectious disease intervertebral disc adjacent vertebral body , often protracted progression . Diagnosis frequently delay unspecific pathology lack specific infection marker . However , early diagnosis fundamental prevent long period symptom include extensive back pain progressive destructive change spine . Cytokines helpful extend knowledge diverse biological process . Furthermore , promise category biomarkers already present early phase develop disease . Currently , little known participation cytokine Spondylodiscitis . The aim study establish non-invasive method improve diagnosis spondylodiscitis . Therefore , blood tissue sample analyze different time point concentration specific cytokine select potential marker cytokine via Multiplex Assay . After successful identification marker cytokine , verification result do expression analysis cytokine-producing cell . The potential diagnostic method lie reduce medical cost prevent extensive pain structural change spine . Experimental research perform approval ethic committee medical faculty University Cologne .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Spondylodiscitis primary infection intervertebral disc secondary infection adjacent end-plates vertebral body . It relatively rare incidence 2.4:100.000 three time common among men . The process infection , commonly creep , lead destruction vertebral body production abscess , cause neurological deficit . Clinical symptom , especially early stage , uncommon . Patients suffer unspecific back pain fever occur 50 % case . Currently , marker use include leucocyte count , erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( ESR ) C-reactive protein ( CRP ) also unspecific.For reason several week may elapse first sign symptoms final diagnosis spondylodiscitis . Therefore , identification pathogen indispensable effective antibiotic therapy . Spinal infection generally monomicrobial , frequently haematogenous source . Therefore , blood culture use identify pathogen . In case negative blood culture , pathogen identify invasive method percutaneous punch biopsy CT-guided fine needle aspiration . Despite biopsy , pathogen identify two three patient . Failures pathogen identification mainly due previous systemic antibiotic treatment . As consequence , diagnosis often base medical image method ( CT , MRT , PET , radiograph , skeletal scintigraphy ) . The disadvantage method structural change spine must occur become visible . Treatment advance spondylodiscitis consist removal necrotic tissue , stabilization affect vertebral body concomitant antibiotic therapy . Randomized study duration antibiotic treatment publish yet . Current recommendation 6 12 week . For evaluate therapy response clinical improvement CRP value use . The mean period stay hospital 49 day . The goal establish non-invasive method allow discrimination infectious non-infectious disease improve diagnosis spondylodiscitis . For purpose , blood tissue sample patient spondylodiscitis erosive osteochondrosis collect analyzed cytokine concentration . Erosive osteochondrosis non-infectious , degenerative disease spine similar surgical treatment . Thus , optimal reference group . Nevertheless , erosive osteochondrosis include special type , call modic type I-III . Because modic type I associate immune response cause repeat trauma spine modic type exclude study . Cytokines messenger , present blood tissue , regulate immune response . In study , goal ass cytokine profile contribute discrimination infectious non-infectious spondylodiscitis could verify characterization cytokine-producing cell . Furthermore , investigator want analyze therapy response measure cytokine profile . Routine blood collection carry directly surgery also stationary hospitalization day 4 day 10 . Additional blood collection do 6 week 3 month follow-up . At time point serum plasma use study determine cytokine concentration expression cytokine-producing cell . Necrotic tissue , remove surgery , analyze microbiologically well pathologically . Parts tissue also use determination cytokine . Further blood sample collect patient appear Department Orthopaedic Surgery Traumatology treatment therapy re-infection . A minimum 15 patient per group - control group ( erosive osteochondrosis modic type II-III ) spondylodiscitis - include study . Both group homogeneous sex age distribution . There additional pain complication patient participate study . All sample collect period one year store -80Â°C . Afterwards , blood tissue sample analyze potential marker cytokine use Multiplex Assay . Furthermore , result link anamnesis detect potential correlation . Specific correlation indicate diagnostic perhaps prognostic value measure cytokine .</detailed_description>
