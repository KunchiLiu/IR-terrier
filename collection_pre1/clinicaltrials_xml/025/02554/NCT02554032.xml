	<brief_title>The Aortic Surgery Cerebral Protection Evaluation ( ACE ) Randomized CardioLink-3 Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgery thoracic aorta often require brief period deep hypothermic circulatory arrest ( DHCA ) . The feared complication aortic surgery neurological injury , range mild cognitive impairment severe injury stroke . Due significant morbidity mortality associate post-operative stroke neurological dysfunction , cerebral protection technique evolve extensively . A recommended approach cerebral protection DHCA deliver blood brain antegrade fashion via arterial system , call antegrade cerebral perfusion ( ACP ) . Axillary artery cannulation , form ACP , become preferred method neuroprotection aortic operation require DHCA . However , axillary artery cannulation require surgical time present potential complication brachial plexus injury , seromas , limb ischemia . The present study aim determine whether less common alternative strategy , innominate artery cannulation , offer similar neuroprotection compare axillary artery cannulation reduces operative time . A total 110 patient undergoing elective aortic surgery two centre randomly assign one two strategy . The primary outcome number patient new ischemic lesion find post-operative diffusion weight MRI ( DW-MRI ) total operative time .</detailed_description>
