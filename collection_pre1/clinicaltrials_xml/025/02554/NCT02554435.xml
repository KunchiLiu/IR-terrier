Participants ( N = 40 ) randomize receive evidence-based brief counsel plus either EAM pedometer . Investigators propose two Specific Aims : AIM 1 : Evaluate feasibility acceptability implement technology-enhanced brief intervention increase physical activity primary care set . Measures feasibility include day EAM worn , usage app , technological problem , attrition , adverse event . Acceptability measure self-report focus group . AIM 2 : Compare counsel plus EAM intervention counsel plus pedometer intervention . Primary outcome change PA cardiovascular risk . We also investigate secondary outcome ( difference adherence , weight body composition , health status , motivation , physical function , psychological feeling , self-regulation ) .</detailed_description>
