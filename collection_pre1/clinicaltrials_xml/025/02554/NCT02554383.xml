	<brief_title>Efficacy Antibiotics Children With Acute Sinusitis : Which Subgroups Benefit ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current clinical practice guideline American Academy Pediatrics Diagnosis Management Acute Bacterial Sinusitis recommend diagnosis acute sinusitis make symptom upper respiratory infection ( URI ) persist beyond 10 day without show sign improvement ( persistent presentation ) , symptoms appear worsen ( 6th 10th day ) period improvement ( worsen presentation ) , high fever purulent nasal discharge present concurrently least 3 consecutive day ( severe presentation ) . In study date , child persistent worsen presentation comprise &gt; 95 % case . The investigator preliminary data available literature suggest subset child diagnose acute sinusitis basis current criterion likely bacterial disease . This entirely surprising current criterion rely solely duration quality respiratory tract symptom ( common non-specific ) . Accordingly , seem likely many child currently diagnose acute sinusitis actually uncomplicated upper respiratory infection . This important acute sinusitis one common diagnose antimicrobial prescribed child United States , account 7.9 million prescription annually . A critical need thus exist establish subgroup child currently diagnose acute sinusitis actually benefit antimicrobial therapy . The objective trial determine whether certain subgroup child acute sinusitis exist antibiotic therapy appropriately withhold . This objective achieve conduct large , randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled clinical trial child 2 12 year age persistent worsen presentation acute sinusitis . Based investigator preliminary data , investigator hypothesize certain subgroup child currently treat acute sinusitis actually benefit antimicrobial therapy . By identify , large placebo-controlled trial , subgroup child respectively benefit antimicrobial therapy , investigator well able determine child classify acute bacterial sinusitis . Accordingly , result trial may impact treatment guideline acute sinusitis also diagnostic criterion , help ensure , extent possible , antibiotic use limited appropriate patient . This , turn , maximize likelihood achieve optimal outcome minimize risk promote antibiotic resistance .</detailed_description>
