	<brief_summary>The investigator propose conduct retrospective study single agent ceritinib patient previously untreated anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) rearrange adenocarcinoma lung sole purpose characterize genomic landscape ceritinib time disease progression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Genomic Landscape Ceritinib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Further improvement therapy achieve well understanding genomic landscape ALK rearrange non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , specifically time disease progression follow treatment ALK inhibitor . Recently , secondary ALK mutation , L1196M G1269A describe patient acquire resistance crizotinib . A small subset ALK positive lung cancer patient progress treatment ceritinib tumor available molecular analysis . Secondary mutation find include G1202R , F1174C , F1174V . While interest , unbiased genomic study ( exome whole genome sequencing ) use massively parallel sequence time disease progression critical fully understand clonal evolution molecular mechanism underpin treatment resistance . To best investigator ' knowledge , study yet report . The investigator believe time ripe comprehensively characterize genomic alteration use massively parallel sequence technology ALK drive adenocarcinoma lung fully understand clonal heterogeneity therapy fully understand clonal evolution molecular mechanism underpin treatment resistance . A good understanding genomic alteration unbiased comprehensive approach likely would lead rationally design therapy augment response ALK inhibitor .</detailed_description>
