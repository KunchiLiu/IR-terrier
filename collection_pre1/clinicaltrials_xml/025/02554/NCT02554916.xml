	<detailed_description>Participants forty-eight old adult pre-clinical mobility disability randomize one three intervention group : dual-belt treadmill exercise , traditional treadmill exercise , non-contact control . Prior follow 16 week therapy , observe participant ' perform several functional movement ( walk , stand sit , sit standing , walk stair ) measure muscular activity . These performance-based measure obtain determine whether movement function improve result therapeutic intervention . The participant ' absolute performance task matter much make best effort test . They welcome take break point test training .</detailed_description>
