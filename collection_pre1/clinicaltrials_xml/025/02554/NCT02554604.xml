	<detailed_description>Scientific background Preeclampsia syndrome characterize onset hypertension proteinuria end-organ dysfunction . It develop 20 week gestation cause significant maternal fetal morbidity mortality ( 1,2 ) . The pathophysiology preeclampsia think developmental abnormality placental vasculature lead placental under-perfusion ischemia . This ischemia believe mediate release anti-angiogenic factor maternal circulation , cause endothelial dysfunction , hypertension end-organ injury ( 2 ) . The elemental factor lead development placental vasculature abnormality still elucidate . However , histological change placenta include atherosis ( lipid laden cell wall arteriole ) , fibrinoid necrosis , thrombosis , sclerotic narrowing arteriole , placental infarction , similar finding see atherosclerotic plaque ( 1-3 ) . Another close association mechanism preeclampsia atherosclerosis find large epidemiological study demonstrate strong correlation preeclampsia ( PET ) development cardiovascular disease later life ( 4 ) . Women PET likely normal pregnancy develop chronic hypertension , cardiovascular disease , stroke , diabetes end-stage renal disease ( 1,4 ) .Common atherosclerotic disease , hypertension , chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , hypercholesterolemia diabetes strongly associate preeclampsia pregnancy ( 5-6 ) . Large epidemiologic experimental study show association low level high density lipid ( HDL ) blood increase cardiovascular risk ( 7 ) . The cardioprotective property HDL think compose several mechanism , include regulation endothelial function enhance NO production maintain endothelial integrity , well anti-inflammatory , anti-oxidative anti-thrombotic effect ( 8-9 ) . However , pharmacological study report increase plasma HDL improve cardiovascular outcome ( 10-12 ) . At time , emerge data reveal importance quality HDL quantity . HDL patient CKD find lose anti-atherogenic endothelial protective effect . In study Shroff et al . ( 13 ) , HDL patient CKD incubate primary endothelial cell line . Several endothelial function , reduce NO production , permission SO production , increase VCAM-1 expression reduction cholesterol efflux capacity decrease compare HDL healthy individual . These effect associate vascular dysfunction marker patient , high level urate , angiopoeitin IL-6 , well poor vascular function measurement , measure aortic pulse velocity carotid intima medium thickness . These negative function increase CKD severity progress show partial improvement kidney transplantation ( 13 ) . Information regard composition function serum lipid lipoproteins among preeclamptic pregnancy compare normal pregnancy scarce . Early pregnancy dyslipidemia , particularly hypertriglyceridemia appear associate increased risk preeclampsia ( 14 ) . However , equivocal result find regard paraoxonase 1 ( PON1 ) activity , antioxidative enzyme find HDL inhibits low density lipid ( LDL ) HDL oxidation . PON1 activity decrease disease associate endothelial activation dysfunction include diabetes , hypercholesterolemia cardiovascular disease ( 15 ) . Demir et al . ( 16 ) find low level HDL , ApoA1 paraoxonase activity preeclamptic compare normal pregnancy , whereas Acikgoz et al . ( 17 ) demonstrate significantly high PON1 activity preeclamptic compare normal pregnancy . Saliva contain constituent reflect diseased physiologic state human body hence could utilize diagnostic purpose . The source composition whole saliva ( oral fluid ) unique complex . Saliva consist secretion salivary gland gingival crevicular fluid , oral mucosa transudate , secretion nasal pharyngeal mucosa , nonadherent bacteria , desquamate oral epithelial cell , keratin debris , blood cell , possibly food medication residual ( 18 ) . Its function include lubrication , digestion , antimicrobial activity , facilitate remineralization dental enamel , maintain normal taste sensation ( 19 ) . These important function achieve various chemical component saliva include water , inorganic compound ( ion ) , organic compound ( non-proteins lipid ) , protein/polypeptides , hormone ( 19 ) . The search reliable salivary biomarkers develop rapidly , especially oral cancer , spur fact collect saliva simpler less invasive draw blood . Salvador-Moys√©n et al . ( 20 ) aim determine usefulness salivary cortisol predictor preeclampsia adolescent . They find cortisol concentration &gt; 14.9 nmol/L observe group develop preeclampsia , whereas control group value &lt; 10.1 nmol/L . Volatile organic compound ( VOC ) detect breath blood use early detection characterization development progression disease ( 21 ) . Many VOC detect breath systemic endogenous produce physiological process , metabolic route behind production know ( 22 ) . Other VOCs exogenous result external contamination inhale air ingest food drink . Solid phase microextraction ( SPME ) simple , automate , rapid technique VOC detection combine gas chromatography-mass spectrometry ( GC-MS ) ( 20 ) . To best knowledge , study conduct identify VOC saliva preeclamptic woman . Objectives 1 . There correlation diagnosis preeclampsia severity change HDL quality , term composition function . 2 . Determine whether preeclampsia-induced change VOCs saliva use early diagnosis preeclampsia . Research goals 1 . Assess : HDL composition function normal preeclamptic pregnancy week 12-14 ( second trimester ) , week 28-30 ( third trimester ) delivery Apo-A1 property , PON1 activity HDL size HDL lipid content HDL antioxidant activity ( toward LDL macrophage ) HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux macrophages 2 . Evaluate effect HDL woman PET , normal pregnancy non-pregnant woman , primary endothelial culture regard protein , mRNA miRNAs , significant component normal endothelial function relate inflammatory response . 3 . Evaluate difference genomic lipid profile cord blood placenta woman PET , normal pregnancy non-pregnant woman 4 . Identify VOC saliva , early biomarkers PET second third trimester delivery .</detailed_description>
