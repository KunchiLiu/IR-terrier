To end , investigator recruit prospectively follow 3 group patient ischemic stroke 1 year . During first night hospital admission due acute stroke , nocturnal breathing assess mean respiratory polygraphy . Patients significant sleep disorder breathing , define Apnea-Hypopnea-Index ( AHI ) ≥ 30/h , randomize ASV treatment treatment ( sSDB ASV+ sSDB ASV- ) .

Stroke patient without SDB ( AHI &lt; 5 / h ) serve control group ( SDB ) observe evolution lesion volume stroke outcome without additional burden SDB .

Short- long-term clinical stroke outcome assess clinical scale questionnaires 4 7 day , 3 month 1 year follow stroke .

	<detailed_description>Background Investigating interrelation stroke sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB ) major importance . Stroke affect 2-3 individual per 1000 year common neurological cause hospitalization long-term disability adulthood . SDB , i.e. , obstructive , central mixed form sleep apnea syndrome , highly prevalent acute stroke , affect approximately 50 % stroke patient . It also significant risk factor stroke . Beside high prevalence , SDB negatively influence stroke outcome . SDB stroke find associate faster progression stroke severity , high blood pressure level long hospitalization acute phase . Chronically , stroke patient SDB exhibit bad functional outcome high mortality . The mechanisms leading detrimental effect SDB stroke outcome multiple include change cerebral hemodynamics brain oxygenation well number humoral systemic change . Frequent arousal sleep interruption deep sleep sleep continuity may also negatively influence sleep-associated neuroplasticity . Adaptive Servo-Ventilation ( ASV ) treatment choice mix complex sleep apnea syndrome , consist coexistence obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea central event . Pressure support adjust base patient 's recent minute ventilation respiratory rate , mean ventilation vary gradually naturally course night continuously adjust patient 's need . Due high prevalence SDB follow stroke detrimental effect stroke outcome , crucial investigate whether early treatment central , obstructive mixed form SDB Adaptive Servo-Ventilation ( ASV ) beneficial effect evolution lesion volume clinical stroke outcome . Objective The primary objective present trial ass whether immediate onset ASV treatment ischemic stroke patient significant SDB ( sSDB , Apnea-Hypopnea-Index ( AHI ) ≥ 30/h ) favorable effect infarct growth assess difference lesion volume 90 day treatment start . The potential reduction infarct growth also result well clinical stroke outcome . One secondary objective trial therefore assess whether immediate onset ASV treatment stroke patient SDB improve clinical cognitive outcome . Moreover , investigator investigate whether improves short long-term cortical reorganization ass functional rest state imaging . The investigator also interest whether ASV treatment improve physiological parameter blood pressure endothelial function/arterial stiffness also whether tolerate associated good treatment compliance . Methods 3 group patient prospectively follow 1 year . ASV treatment start second night follow hospital admission due acute ischemic stroke end 90 day later . Group assignment take place day follow stroke assessment SDB respiratory polygraphy . Patients AHI ≥ 30/h randomized ASV treatment treatment ( sSDB ASV+ sSDB ASV- ) . Stroke patient without SDB ( AHI &lt; 5 / h ) serve control group ( SDB ) observe evolution lesion volume stroke outcome without additional burden SDB . Evolution lesion volume first 90st day follow stroke clinical ( include cognitive ) outcome 90 day stroke compare stroke patient sSDB receive ASV treatment ( sSDB ASV+ ) versus treatment ( sSDB ASV- ) stroke patient without SBD ( SDB , AHI &lt; 5 / h ) .</detailed_description>
