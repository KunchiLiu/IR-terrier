	<brief_summary>Physical activity perform postprandial state ability blunt postprandial glycemia acutely , even result light small amount postprandial physical activity . Postprandial physical activity decrease postprandial glycemia effectively activity perform post-absorptive state . However , study compare postprandial postabsorptive physical activity measure glycemic outcome short period time ( hour ) use large dose physical activity . Physical activity ability entail acute increase marker systemic inflammation.Previous study also show systemic inflammation increase glycemic spike , high carbohydrate load . Therefore effect postprandial physical activity difficult predict . One one hand might increase marker systemic inflammation . On hand might decrease systemic inflammation result blunt effect postprandial glycemia . The effect physical activity carbohydrate intake might therefore also differ postabsorptive physical activity . Purpose study : I ) The investigator hypothesize light physical activity perform post-prandial sate decrease blood glucose day night cycle compare activity perform postabsorptive state control day . II ) To test whether postabsorptive postprandial light physical activity affect marker systemic inflammation different . 12 participant diagnose hyperglycemia hypoglycemic medication take part randomize cross-over trial 3 test day . A control day physical activity , two day similar control day except one contain one hour bout treadmill walk prior breakfast similar exercise bout breakfast . Continuous glucose monitoring perform start exercise / breakfast morning next day ( least 22 hour ) . Venous blood also sample give timepoints ( exercise / breakfast , 1.5 , 2.5 , 3.5 24 hour breakfast . Dietary intake individually standardize prior test day .</brief_summary>
