	<brief_summary>A novel rehabilitation bike develop patient incomplete spinal cord injury incorporate mechanical stimulators bike pedal stimulate sensory receptor sole foot ; effect mechanical stimulator muscle strengthen report NASA improve muscle atrophy astronauts zero-gravity environment . Cycling also stimulate low limb position sensor . We predict combination mechanical stimulation cycling may similar enough walking ground lead gain balance mobility . The present study evaluate therapeutic effect bike balance , walking , well cortical-spinal spinal pathway patient incomplete spinal cord injury .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION : Individuals spinal cord injury ( SCI ) experience balance impairment limitation walk . Newer research demonstrate even several year individual incomplete SCIs make significant gain function engage targeted physical activity . Previous study use functional electrical stimulation locomotion train report reduce spasticity reflex control , increase electromyography activity stepping , increase thigh muscle mass . However , method instrument bulky , expensive , need technical maintenance , must use clinical setting . A novel rehabilitation bicycle use simultaneous stimulation plantar mechanoreceptors hip joint proprioceptor develop department Biomedical Engineering University Manitoba . An advantage device patient use home minimal assistance . Five patient complete initial pilot test exhibit overall improvement Berg Balance Scale . Presently , effect rehabilitation bike train plasticity spinal corticospinal neuronal circuitry consequently effect functional walking capacity unclear . OBJECTIVES : The purpose present study evaluate effect rehabilitation bike corticospinal spinal plasticity , functional walking balance incomplete SCI individual . METHODS : Ten individual chronic incomplete SCI participate study . The protocol include 30 minute training session , three times/week , 8 week . The study design before-after clinical trial two baseline assessment prior training . Post-training evaluation two week do post-training follow-up assessment two week . Evaluations functional recovery independence include : Six -Minute Ten-Meter Walk Tests , Walking index spinal cord injury ( WISCI II ) . The Berg Balance Scale ( BBS ) conduct assess balance . Results compare training . H-reflex motor evoke potential ( use transcranial magnetic stimulation , TMS ) also measure cycle train assess plasticity level spine corticospinal pathway respectively . ANTICIPATED RESULTS : Compared locomotion training treadmill robotic device , use rehabilitation bike affordable patient able use independently home , without help physical therapist caregiver . Results study clarify possible positive effect training rehabilitation bike corticospinal reorganization well train effect functional recovery balance walking . If finding present study consistent initial pilot data , provide incomplete SCI patient therapists new option rehabilitation feasible cost-effective . Considering relatively high incidence SCI Manitoba , finding study directly improve quality life Manitobans Canadians live spinal cord injury .</detailed_description>
