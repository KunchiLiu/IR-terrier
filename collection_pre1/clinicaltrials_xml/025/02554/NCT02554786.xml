	<criteria>Patients diagnosis asthma , period least 1 year prior Visit 1 ( Screening ) Patients use medium high dose ICS low dose LABA/ICS combination asthma least 1 year stable dos least 1 month prior Visit 1 Patients must ACQ7 score ≥ 1.5 Visit 101 Visit 102 ( prior doubleblind treatment ) qualify treatment medium high dose LABA/ICS Prebronchodilator ≥ 50 % FEV1 &lt; 80 % predict normal value patient withhold bronchodilator Visit 101 102 , accord ATS/ERS criterion . Withholding period bronchodilator prior spirometry : SABA ≥ 6 hour FDC free combination ICS/LABA ≥ 48 hour , SAMA ≥ 8 hour , LAMA ≥ 7 day , xanthine &gt; =07 day A onetime repeat/retesting percent predict FEV1 ( prebronchodilator FEV1 ) allow . Spacer device permit reversibility test . Patients demonstrate increase FEV1 12 % 200 mL within 30 minute administration 400 µg salbutamol/360 µg albuterol ( equivalent dose ) Visit 101 All patient must perform reversibility test Visit 101 If reversibility demonstrate Visit 101 : Reversibility repeat Patients may permit enter study historical evidence reversibility perform accord ATS/ERS guideline within 1 year prior Visit Alternatively , patient may permit enter study historical positive bronchoprovocation test perform within 2 year prior Visit 1 . Patients smoke inhaled tobacco product within 6 month period prior Visit 1 , smoke history great 10 pack year . This include use nicotine inhaler ecigarettes time Visit 1 Patients asthma attack/exacerbation require systemic steroid hospitalization emergency room visit within 6 week Visit 1 ( Screening ) Patients ever require intubation severe asthma attack/exacerbation . Patients clinical condition likely worsen ICS administration ( e.g . glaucoma , cataract fragility fracture ) accord investigator 's medical judgment risk participate study ) . Patients respiratory tract infection asthma worsen determined investigator within 4 week prior Visit 1 ( Screening ) Visit 1 Visit 102 . Patients may rescreened 4 week recovery respiratory tract infection asthma worsen . Patients history chronic lung disease asthma , include ( limited ) COPD , sarcoidosis , interstitial lung disease , cystic fibrosis , clinically significant bronchiectasis active tuberculosis . Patients severe narcolepsy and/or insomnia . Patients clinically significant ECG abnormality Visit 101 ( Start Run In/Baseline epoch ) time Visit 101 Visit 102 ( include unscheduled ECG ) Patients history hypersensitivity lactose , study drug similar drug within class include untoward reaction sympathomimetic amine inhale medication component thereof Patients achieve acceptable spirometry result Visit 101 accordance American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society ( ATS/ERS ) criteria acceptability repeatability ( rescreening allow ) . Repeat spirometry may allow adhoc visit spirometry qualify due ATS/ERS criterion . If patient fail repeat assessment , patient may rescreened Patients Maintenance Immunotherapy ( desensitization ) allergies less 3 month prior Visit 101 patient Maintenance Immunotherapy 3 month prior Visit 101 expect change throughout course study .
