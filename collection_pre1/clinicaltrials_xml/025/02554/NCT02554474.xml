	<detailed_description>Patient self-management fundamental component arthritis care often neglect . Physical activity essential part self-management , however , less half people arthritis active . There several factor associate low physical activity participation motivation , doubt effectiveness prescribe exercise , lack health professional advice way progress physical activity . The variety risk factor highlight need multifaceted approach provide support term knowledge , skill development timely advice health professional , well motivational support stay active . Our primary objective ass efficacy physical activity counsel model , involve use Fitbit Flex ( wireless physical activity tracker ) pair FitViz application ( app ) , group education session , telephone counsel physiotherapist , improve physical activity participation patient rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) . Our secondary objective ass effect intervention reduce patient ' sedentary time , improve fatigue , mood , pain , self-efficacy arthritis management . We carry three aim : 1 ) To develop FitViz app pair Fitbit enhance user experience , 2 ) To conduct pilot test Fitbit/FitViz intervention , 3 ) To evaluate effect physical activity coach model patient RA SLE . In proof-of-concept randomized control trial ( RCT ) , investigator hypothesize compare control group ( i.e . Delayed Intervention group ) , participant Immediate Intervention Group 1 ) increase moderate/vigorous physical activity ( MVPA ) , 2 ) reduce sedentary time , 3 ) improve fatigue , mood , pain level , 4 ) improve self-efficacy disease management . The investigator use mixed-methods approach , involve RCT in-depth interview . The proof-of-concept study employ step wedge RCT design , whereby intervention sequentially roll participant number time period . The order individual receive intervention determine random . The strength design properly address efficacy question , avoid dilemma withhold intervention participant , parallel group design .</detailed_description>
