	<detailed_description>Introduction : Diabetic retinopathy ( DR ) common complication among 300,000 Danish patient diabetes . Amongst diabetes , diabetic macular edema ( DME ) lead cause visual impairment time affect 29 % patient . It establish Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) focal/grid laser photocoagulation reduces risk visual loss patient DME small likelihood visual improvement . In recent year intravitreal anti-VEGF agent like bevacizumab , ranibizumab aflibercept consistently demonstrate efficacy visual improvement DME-treatment . However , high number injection need per patient achieve sustainable visual improvement . Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network ( DRCR.net ) show , median number intravitreal ranibizumab injection 9 first 3 second year . The burden intravitreal injection concern substantial patient well health care system . Because DME , 550 intravitreal injection give Odense University Hospital 2014 . The medicine expense approximate 3.3 million DKK increase prevalence diabetes number expect rise significantly year come . This call initiative like cost-effective treatment well understand underlying predictor successful treatment order improve individualize treatment . Navilas® ( OD-OS GmbH , Teltow , Germany ) navigate laser photocoagulation system combine fluorescein angiography image stabilization track . This increase capability localize subsequently treat leak microaneurysms . The ability preplan deliver plan spot automatic mode lead observation navigate laser treatment reduces need intravitreal injection bevacizumab ranibizumab . In 12-month prospective study patient center-involving DME Liegl et al compare navigate laser ranibizumab ranibizumab monotherapy . All patient initially receive 3 monthly ranibizumab injection additional injection pro nata . In addition , patient combination group receive navigate laser photocoagulation load phase . The study demonstrate similar improvement best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) significant low need additional intravitreal injection ( 35 % vs. 84 % , p &lt; 0.001 ) well low number additional injection combination group ( mean 0.9 vs. 3.9 , p &lt; 0.001 ) . Aflibercept replace ranibizumab first-choice treatment AMD Denmark , DME-treatment result indicate low number intravitreal injection require well great improvement visual acuity , especially amongst bad visual acuity baseline , compare ranibizumab . However , combination aflibercept navigate laser therapy far test DME . In present standard regime DME-treatment , aflibercept ranibizumab prescribe drug first . Features geometrical pattern retinal vascular system consistently correlate diabetic retinopathy ( DR ) . In early study investigator demonstrate retinal vascular diameter fractal dimension independently able predict long-term microvascular complication diabetes ( proliferative DR , nephropathy neuropathy ) . In DME , investigator report laser photocoagulation associate low macular retinal vascular diameter , possibly due autoregulated vascular narrow give low oxygen demand laser therapy . The investigator speculate change retinal vascular geometry may use measure treatment response test prospective study . Retinal vessel oxygen saturation another non-invasive measurement retinal function . Oxymap T1 ( Oxymap , Reykjavik , Iceland ) make possible evaluate metabolic change retina . It demonstrate Jørgensen et al patient DME high oxygen saturation retinal venule , treatment response retinal vessel oxygen saturation still unknown . The effect macular ischemia DME still debatable . Macular ischemia impact functional anatomical outcome intravitreal injection anti-VEGF study short-term study . In case-control study , Douvali et al demonstrate six month patient treat ranibizumab DME negative functional outcome macular ischemia baseline compare non-ischemic . However , effect macular ischemia functional anatomical outcome DME-treatment demonstrate aflibercept-treatment . Primary goal : In randomize 12-months prospective 1:1 study patient diabetic macular edema , ADDENDUM aim ( 1 ) examine treatment response intravitreal aflibercept navigate laser compare intravitreal aflibercept conventional Pascal laser , ( 2 ) identify non-invasive retinal risk factor ( retinal vessel diameter , fractal dimension , oxygen saturation ) successful treatment outcome , ( 3 ) evaluate baseline level macular ischemia marker successful treatment outcome . Hypothesis : - Combination therapy intravitreal aflibercept navigate laser lead decrease need intravitreal injection . - Non-invasive retinal marker make possible predict treatment response patient DME . Laser treatment lead low retinal vascular diameter , low fractal dimension higher retinal oxygen saturation patient successful treatment outcome ( irrespectively treatment group ) . - The level macular ischemia baseline negatively correlate functional anatomical outcome patient treat aflibercept DME ( irrespectively treatment group ) . Trial design : Period : 1 September 2015 - 31 August 2019 Setup : 12-month randomized prospective 1:1 study compare intravitreal aflibercept navigated Navilas® laser ( group A , n=24 ) intravitreal aflibercept conventional Pascal laser ( group B , n=24 ) . Plan : - Patients recruited Region Southern Denmark include study base clinical examination . Patients randomized baseline ( BL ) . Patients eye eligible participate one eye group . - Patients receive intravitreal treatment month ( M ) 0 , 1 2 ( see Treatment scheme ) . At M3 laser treatment perform possible determined examiner . - From M4 patient follow monthly additional intravitreal injection give pro nata . - Criteria re-treatment : 1 . Central retinal thickness &gt; 20 % low measurement . 2 . Loss BCVA &gt; 5 letter compare baseline . - Eyes suitable laser treatment M3 continue treatment monthly pro nata intravitreal regimen . If laser give end M5 patient withdrawn study . Examination : - Systemic biomarkers : Age , type diabetes , duration diabetes , health history , smoke status , blood pressure , body mass index , hemoglobin A1c , glomerular filtration rate , serum creatinine ( BL ) . - Diabetes therapy ( BL , M12 ) . - ETDRS BCVA measurement ( BL , M0-M12 ) . - Intraocular pressure ( BL , M12 ) . - Cataract LOCS grading . - Heidelberg fluorescein angiography , incl . measurement area foveal avascular zone [ FAZ ] ( BL , M3 , M12 ) . - Topcon 3D OCT-2000 spectral domain OCT ( BL , M0-M12 ) . - Retinal vessel geometry measurement ( BL , M3 , M6 , M12 ) . - Oxymap retinal oximetry measurement ( BL , M3 , M6 , M12 ) . - Optos widefield retinal imaging ( BL , M3 , M6 , M12 ) . Primary endpoint : - Percentage eye receive additional aflibercept injection laser month 12 group A B ( Paper I ) . Secondary endpoint : - Number additional aflibercept injection laser month 12 group A B ( Paper I ) . - Change ETDRS visual acuity baseline month 12 group A B ( Paper I ) . - Change global macular retinal vessel geometric marker ( retinal vascular diameter fractal dimension ) baseline month 12 group A B ( Paper II ) . - Change global macular oxygen saturation baseline month 12 group A B ( Paper II ) . - Evaluation non-invasive retinal risk factor ( retinal vascular geometric marker oxygen saturation ) successful treatment outcome month 12 ( multiple logistic regression model adjust age , sex , duration diabetes , smoking , blood pressure , body mass index , hemoglobin A1c renal marker ) ( Paper II ) . - Change level macular ischemia ( area FAZ ) baseline month 12 group A B ( Paper III ) . - Evaluation baseline area FAZ marker successful treatment outcome month 12 ( multiple logistic regression model adjust age , sex , duration diabetes , smoking , blood pressure , body mass index , hemoglobin A1c renal marker ) ( Paper III ) . Clinical implication scientific outcome : Combination therapy intravitreal aflibercept navigate laser photocoagulation likely future DME-treatment . As compare intravitreal monotherapy , few injection low cost meet demand patient well society . Identification retinal risk marker DME treatment outcome offer attractive assistance guidance individualize treatment planning . The present study perform PhD Study University Southern Denmark . Three paper high-ranking international peer-reviewed journal plan . All result publish irrespective positive negative outcome . Facilities : A research laboratory establish Department Ophthalmology , Odense University Hospital . Necessary equipment study well office facility available department . Oxymap T1 , Pascal laser , Navilas® laser software retinal vascular measurement analysis ( IVAN image analysis software Singapore Institute Vessel Assessment-Fractal version 1.0 ) available . Rental Topcon 3D OCT-2000 include budget . Statistical calculation : The primary endpoint present study percentage eye need additional intravitreal injection laser . Sample size calculation base study Liegl et al evaluated effect combine intravitreal ranibizumab navigate laser treatment versus ranibizumab monotherapy DME . In study additional injection need 35 % 85 % , respectively . Given probability level 0.05 statistical power level 90 % , study size 19 patient group need present study . In order compensate 20 % drop-out rate , 24 patient include group .</detailed_description>
