	<brief_summary>The purpose propose research examine effect two treatment approach speech production involve speaker chronic apraxia speech ( AOS ) aphasia . The planned investigation design examine acquisition , maintenance generalization effect treatment . One approach , electropalatography ( EPG ) use visual biofeedback conjunction articulatory-kinematic treatment approach , sound production treatment ( SPT ) one systematically study articulatory-kinematic treatment AOS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Apraxia Speech : Comparison EPG Treatment ( Tx ) Sound Production Treatment ( SPT )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>EPG use treat apraxia speech ( AOS ) well speech production disorder ( i.e. , articulation disorder &amp; cleft palate ) . SPT one systematically study treatment approach AOS . Both treatment approach consider clinical treatment approaches/standards care AOS . The pseudopalate use conjunction EPG treatment acceptable device treat speech production disorder include AOS . The pseudopalate custom-fit patient similar dental retainer consider minimally invasive . The purpose research systematically examine effect treatment speech production use EPG treatment vs. SPT approach . The planned investigation intend explicate acquisition , maintenance , generalization effect treatment approach . The specific experimental question address follow : 1 . Will treatment use EPG approach SPT approach result great accuracy articulation train speech sound produce word ? 2 . Will treatment use EPG approach SPT approach result great accuracy articulation untrained exemplar train speech sound produce word ( i.e. , response generalization ) ? 3 . Will treatment use EPG approach SPT approach result great long term maintenance effect train speech sound ? 4 . Do different treatment approach result distinct rating functional communication skill via Aphasia Communication Outcome Measure ( ACOM ; Doyle et al. , 2012 ) outcome measure speech intelligibility use Assessment Intelligibility Dysarthric Speech ( AIDS ; Yorkston &amp; Beukelman , 1981 ) ?</detailed_description>
