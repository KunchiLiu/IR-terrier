	<brief_summary>Data confirm role PDE5 adipocyte biology vitro recently report . However , good understand complex role PDE5 fat metabolism whole body homeostasis require use transgenic animal model either lack overexpressing PDE5 adipose tissue . This clarify role PDE5 adipose expansion metabolism , also glucose homeostasis vascular function vivo . Analysis expression activity PDE5 different site human adipose tissue ( i.e . visceral vs. subcutaneous ) , also different metabolic condition ( i.e . high-fat diet vs. low calorie intake ) could reveal PDE5 consider reliable 'marker ' metabolic dysfunction adipocyte . Importantly , chronic treatment PDE5 inhibitor sildenafil mouse model diet-induced insulin resistance cause significant improvement insulin sensitivity . Also , human chronic exposure tadalafil confirm improvement insulin sensitivity men erectile dysfunction . However , efficacy long-term treatment PDE5i await demonstration human metabolic disease obesity insulin resistance . The primary purpose study investigate effect tadalafil take day body composition men sexual distress and/or erectile dysfunction .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design : open-label , randomize control study Study duration : 16 week ( 8 active treatment + 8 follow-up ) At baseline , 8 16 week follow evaluation assess : general physical examination anthropometric parameter i.e. , body weight ( BW ) , height , BMI , waist circumference ( WC ) . Every eight week , body composition calculate use whole body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DEXA-HOLOGIC QDR-1000 ) accord instruction manufacturer standardize procedure , individual Total Fat Mass ( FM ) variation express delta-variation ( % ) baseline . Abdominal fat mass ( distrectual , described R1 ) calculate use arbitrary area square choose trace ideal line join last inferior rib anterior superior iliac spine . Calibration manufacturer 's spine phantom quality control analysis perform daily . Fat Mass express gram per square centimeter ( g/cm2 ) result express variation percentage . Secondary outcome variation forom baseline IIEF-5 , total testosterone , estradiol testosterone /estradiol ratio . STATISTICAL EVALUATION With two-sided alpha value 5 % power 90 % , sample size 20 subject per arm would able detect 2 % variation percentage body lean fat mass baseline upper waist section ( fat mass ) overall body composition ( lean mass ) . Also , test difference treatment group use analysis variance repeat measure . Statistical analysis perform use computer statistical package SPSS 11.0 ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL ) .</detailed_description>
