	<brief_title>Predischarge Bundle Minimize Negative Impact Quality Life Nuisance Bleedings</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent study suggest bleed complication strong influence quality life . During DAPT regimen bleed complication occur 5 % 15 % patient . Nuisance bleeding ( BARC 1 bleeding ) occur frequently show strong influence quality life , depression , anxiety compliance treatment . The aim study establish specific counsel programme might minimize negative quality life impact nuisance bleeding . A computer-generated list use randomize patient 1:1 ratio , stratify age , sex , renal failure P2Y12 inhibitor , either bundle control group . All patient randomize control group ( standard care ) receive education physician regard dual antiplatelet therapy ( DAPT ) part routine discharge process . All patient randomize bundle group receive : ) 15-min visit member research team 24 h prior anticipated discharge day . During visit , core set DAPT risk address . Advantages side effect DAPT describe . The importance compliance discuss . The correct management side effect ( especially BARC 1 bleeding ) discuss . ii ) 15-min visit member research team family member live near/with patient . Advantages side effect DAPT describe . The importance compliance discuss . The correct management side effect ( especially BARC 1 bleeding ) discuss . iii ) brochure describe advantage , side effect management dual antiplatelet therapy . Contemporaneously , investigator study contact directly phone and/or mail general practionnaire patient describe explain topic clinical problem patient . iv ) availability phone number discuss potential side effect DAPT . In addition , study coordinator study contact two time month patient phone ass DAPT compliance potential BARC 1 bleeding .</detailed_description>
