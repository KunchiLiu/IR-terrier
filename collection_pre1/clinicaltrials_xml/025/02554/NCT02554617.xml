	<brief_title>Measurements Exhaled Nitric Oxide Healthy Subjects Thailand</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fractional exhale nitric oxide ( FeNO ) produce epithelial cell inflammatory airway eosinophils gas discover since 1991 . Fractional exhale nitric oxide ( FeNO ) direct association severity inflammation bronchial tree sputum eosinophil use additional investigation diagnosis asthma inflammatory airway disease . There many factor previous study associate level fractional exhale nitric oxide ( FeNO ) , one factor race therefore ca n't use level another study different race use reference study level fractional exhaled nitric oxide Thai population . It therefore desirable examine level fractional exhale nitric oxide ( FeNO ) healthy subject among Thai population main objective research .</detailed_description>
