The Life-Space Assessment ( LSA ) questionnaire Alabama Birmingham Study Aging measure evolution life-space area appropriate way , i.e . spatial area person commonly act . This 20-item assessment capture life-space mobility individual five successive area life-space ( LS ) level ( within home outside town ) . Subjects ask frequency move five area past four week , assistance ( person equipment ) assistance require . A composite life space score ( LSC , range : 0-120 ) calculate combine information life space level , degree independence , frequency . Higher score indicate great life space .
