	<brief_summary>Antimicrobial resistance significant challenge face global healthcare . The unnecessary use antibiotic key driver development antibiotic resistance . Cystic Fibrosis ( CF ) represent unique disease model study bacterial resistance explore therapeutic strategy , chronic lung infection overlap acute lung exacerbation 's cause multitude organism . With time , chronic polymicrobial infection develop , dominant infect organism Pseudomonas aeruginosa . In acute CF infection , empiric intravenous antibiotic usually give two week . Recurrent infection treatment result increase antimicrobial resistance , alteration pathogen host interaction lung gut flora . Next-generation DNA sequence technology offer DNA-based personalised diagnostics treatment strategy . Enhancing knowledge microbiome allow use stratify targeted antibacterial therapy compare standard empirical antibacterial therapy currently use . Cystic Fibrosis Microbiome-determined Antimicrobial Therapy Trial Exacerbations : Results Stratified ( CFMATTERS ) provide randomize multi-centre control trial microbiome-derived antimicrobial treatment versus current empirical therapy .</brief_summary>
