	<brief_summary>Although combined antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) dramatically improve quality life lifespan HIV infected individual , still fail eliminate viral reservoir . The Gut Associated Lymphoid Tissue ( GALT ) large reservoir HIV-1 , harbor HIV target cell activated memory Cluster differentiation ( CD ) 4+/CCR5+ T cell . Intestinal T B cell express α4β7 integrin , gut mucosal home receptor bind gp120 HIV-1 envelope facilitate infection intestinal T cell early establishment gut HIV reservoir . Intensive viral replication GALT lead early impairment mucosal immunity , due severe CD4+ T cell depletion , could also explain lack recruitment gut . Among T cell , interleukin- ( IL- ) 17 secrete CD4+ T cell ( Th17 ) particularly deplete HIV infection . This depletion could associate HIV progression since cell play crucial role maintenance mucosal immunity . A dysbalance Th17/Treg ratio may reflect loss intestinal epithelial barrier integrity . These damage responsible increase microbial translocation , associate immune activation progression AIDS . Several recent study show cART initiation acute early HIV-1 infection reduces HIV DNA reservoir size improve immune reconstitution blood . Post-treatment controller , start long-term cART early HIV infection , low level HIV DNA peripheral blood mononuclear cell , similarly elite controller . Unlike HIV-infected individual , maintain undetectable plasmatic viral load several year cART interruption , suggest weak reservoir prerequisite achieve functional cure . By extrapolation , could hypothesize gut viral reservoir also decrease mucosal immunity restore cART initiate primary phase infection . The gut viral reservoir begin form within first day HIV exposure , grow acute HIV infection . Similarly , intestinal T cell deplete early infection , due high viral replication , host immune response bystander effect . Most study also conclude long-term optimal treatment ca n't fully restore mucosal immunity . These observation lead u study impact time cART start size viral reservoir immune reconstitution gut . For , analyzed virological immunological characteristic rectal HIV reservoir long-term treated patient regard blood CD4+ T cell count time cART initiation .</brief_summary>
