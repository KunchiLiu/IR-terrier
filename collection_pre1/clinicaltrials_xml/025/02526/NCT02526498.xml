	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well accelerate partial breast irradiation ( APBI ) use high-dose rate ( HDR ) brachytherapy work treat patient breast cancer spread beyond breast axillary lymph node ( early-stage ) surgery . Radiation therapy use type energy kill cancer cell shrink tumor . Brachytherapy type internal radiation therapy provide radiation inside breast remain tumor cell next space tumor remove , give short amount time standard radiation therapy . Giving accelerate partial breast irradiation ( APBI ) use high-dose rate ( HDR ) brachytherapy may reduce overall time radiation deliver tumor cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Accelerated Partial Breast Radiation Therapy Using High-Dose Rate Brachytherapy Treating Patients With Early Stage Breast Cancer After Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine toxicity rate shorter course accelerate partial breast irradiation ( APBI ) deliver breast brachytherapy applicator . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine 3-year actuarial local control rate abbreviate accelerate partial breast irradiation ( APBI ) . II . To assess rate excellent good cosmesis 2-years shorter course APBI identify co-variants associate predictive poor cosmetic outcome woman treat overnight treatment course APBI . OUTLINE : Within 1-5 day balloon placement , patient undergo accelerate partial breast irradiation ( APBI ) use high-dose rate ( HDR ) brachytherapy 15-60 minute 2-3 day . After completion study treatment , patient follow 2-8 week least annually 2 year .</detailed_description>
