	<brief_summary>The primary investigator study plan investigate serum concentration ropivacaine pediatric patient already receive standard care continuous wound catheter iliac crest alveolar bone graft harvest completion previous cleft palate repair . The goal study 1 ) determine serum concentration ( free , unbound ) ropivacaine 2 ) To evaluate pain score perioperative period determine efficacy wound catheter postoperative analgesia iliac crest bone graft harvest .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Serum Ropivacaine Concentrations Pediatric Patients Receiving Continuous Wound Catheter Analgesia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There numerous investigation serum concentration ropivicaine use wound catheter adult . These study reveal wound catheter provide effective analgesia without toxic level serum ropivicaine . Our current proposal different two reason . One , investigator investigate serum level ropivacaine pediatric patient . There currently study investigate efficacy technique pediatric population . Two , wound catheter currently place Dr Losee ( plastic surgeon pediatric center ) part standard care different wound catheter . Most wound catheter describe literature place surgical wound muscle facial plane . The catheter place Dr Losee routine postoperative pain control place adjacent periosteum adjacent bone harvest site . Dr Losee perform technique part standard patient care appear provide excellent analgesia without side effect ropivacaine . However , unknown effect location serum plasma level ropivacaine . Measuring unbound ropivacaine help define whether wound catheter maintain serum ropivacaine level , near , toxic level . Pediatric study investigate serum ropivacaine level epidural infusion peripheral nerve block . This local anesthetic safe long administration limit weight base limit . For continuous infusion , ropivacaine administer great rate 0.4 -0.5 mg/kg/hr . The wound catheters The Childrens Hospital Pittsburgh Plastic Surgery service administer 0.25 mg/kg/hr . Ropivacaine local anesthetic choice many pediatric hospital Acute Interventional Pediatric Pain Service Children 's Hospital Pittsburgh appear slight safety advantage bupivacaine . Ropivacaine bind sodium channel avidly bupivacaine therefore may cadiac toxic . However , location catheter alter absorption may alter plasma level . Currently data pediatric iliac crest wound catheter . Since technique already standard care center , plan measure serum ropivacaine level define value . It important understand dosage currently use pediatric population effect serum local anesthetic level . When local anesthetic infuse epidural , peripheral nerve block , wound catheter , elevation local anesthetic plasma level patient . The plasma level depend dose , concentration location catheter . Current literature define plasma level obtain continuous infusion local anesthetic wound catheter adult . Safe infusion rate define adult catheter . This data exist wound catheter pediatric patient study begin define limit . In particular , catheter currently place standard care The Children 's Hospital Pittsburgh periostial unknown effect location serum ropivacaine level</detailed_description>
