	<brief_title>Multiparametric MRI Men With Prostate Cancer Undergoing Active Surveillance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Men localize prostate cancer ( PCa ) small tumor burden may follow active surveillance ( AS ) rather active treatment . AS attempt avoid over-treatment PCa , estimate insignificant time diagnosis , therefore unlikely affect patient morbidity mortality . AS include close monitoring PSA measurement ( blood test ) , digital rectal exploration ( DRE ) trans-rectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy ( TRUS-bx ) regular interval , active treatment initiate cancer becomes aggressive . It crucial patient undergo AS stag correctly , avoid underestimate aggressive disease patient mistakenly enrol AS instead active treatment . Previously , PhD study conduct Herlev Hospital reveal multiparametric MRI ( mp-MRI ) prostate improve detection stag PCa may add additional information tumor aggressiveness compare traditional method DRE TRUS-bx . Mp-MRI inclusion AS may detect miss significant tumor potential area high aggressiveness detect traditional biopsy . Additional target biopsy suspicious area perform re-evaluation treatment plan , advanced disease identify . Conversely , mp-MRI high negative predict value significant disease use rule significant PCa , reassure patient physician go AS . Mp-MRI use Urology Department , Herlev Hospital , since 2013 diagnosis PCa evaluation patient undergoing AS . The main objective study retrospectively investigate , whether mp-MRI improve selection patient suitable Active Surveillance relevance ongoing monitoring .</detailed_description>
