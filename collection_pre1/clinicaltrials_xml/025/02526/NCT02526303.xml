	<brief_title>Anticoagulation Non-occlusive Portal Vein Thrombosis Patients With Liver Cirrhosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Portal vein thrombosis common complication liver cirrhosis , especially decompensated advanced stage . The reported prevalence 10-25 % ultrasound . The effect PVT natural history liver cirrhosis clear , especially non-occlusive PVT . According recent large prospective study ( n=1243 ) , development PVT progression liver disease two separate consequence common mechanism . It hypothesize activation coagulation factor cirrhotic liver portal venous system common mechanism progression liver disease , one hand , development PVT . A recent randomized clinical trial show enoxaparin therapy 48 week prevent disease progression PVT patient Child class B-C cirrhosis . Besides , emerge evidence show 30-50 % patient cirrhosis partial PVT achieve spontaneous recanalization . So role anticoagulation play management PVT liver cirrhosis still contraversal . Anticoagulation therapy also show effective high recanalization rate 42-100 % . But data mostly derive retrospective , non-randomized study well-designed randomize control trial conduct evaluate safety efficacy anticoagulation non-occlusive PVT .</detailed_description>
