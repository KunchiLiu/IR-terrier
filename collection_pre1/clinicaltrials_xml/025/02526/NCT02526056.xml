	<brief_title>Usability Acceptance Exergames Among Elderly People Physiotherapists - Mixed Method Approach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction : The goal usability evaluation ass degree system effective , efficient favour positive attitude response intend user . Exergames particular present unique usability challenge . Because game fundamentally different general productivity tool , traditional usability instrument valid productivity application may fall short use serious game . Additionally , serious game target audience may play game regularly ; usability issue alone hinder game play process negatively affect learn experience . For reason , user-based evaluation exergames adequate test user group important ensure heterogeneous population able interact easily innovative application . Exergames : Exergames define : `` Any number type video game require game player physically move order play '' . The important aspect , comparison normal videogame , player use full body movement control on-screen action require expend significantly great amount energy compare resting level . One area receive attention video game researcher therapeutic session . When exergames use elderly people therapeutic session , show special need consider . The GameUp project : For reason project GameUp start . On Website project consortium state : `` We use IT technology promote mobility encourage elderly person physical active motivating move increase self-efficacy '' . In context exergames elderly people design Kinect® window . Kinect® observe body movement game player , operate game body movement . In context game player force move body frequently way increase agility . Therapist 's view : How physiotherapist view arrival exergames therapy rehabilitation setting , especially exergames elderly people ? Studies focus therapist 's view really rare . One reference come conclusion : `` Video game see replacement therapist . The presence therapist always necessary patient ensure play game correct seat position , provide mental support social interaction game play . '' But therapists view use exergames patient could self-training rehabilitation home ? The reference argue : `` The therapist paramount introduce game virtual rehabilitation end-users ; adopt tool practice , neither patient . '' Purpose Study : The aim study evaluate , elderly people accept exergames self-training method exergame user-friendly elderly people physiotherapist . An additionally goal examine physiotherapist evaluate therapeutic benefit exergame . Research Question : Are exergames useable accepted self-training elderly people , well physiotherapist ? Design user trial : This study usability design qualitative quantitative aspect . In one part , patient , physical strain design facet investigate another part physiotherapists , therapeutic relevance design feature explore . Ideally attribute require make product usable specify measure quantitatively predefined goal . Number user need : How many user need usability study controversial subject literature . One main point : `` The test user ideally reflect serious game 's target audience term age , gender , education demographic characteristic '' . In study mention two important aspect : It seem serious usability problem find 13th 15th participant . Furthermore usability test , aim find study design uncovers usability problem low cost . In consideration argument study protocol include 13-15 participant different mobility level . As mobility level important demographic character , reflect user group . For physiotherapist important demographic character experience exergames , reason 13-15 physiotherapist different experience exergames test . Measurements : Heart Rate ( HR ) : Heart rate indicator cardiovascular strain provide objective measure physical work load . HR elderly user measure playing game , directly finish game two minute break . The predefined usability criterion : The mean HR 80 % elderly user 110 beat per minute . Previous study specify heart rate 90 110 indicates moderate cardiovascular strain . Rate Perceived Exertion ( RPE ) : Borg 's RPE-Scale standardize , reliable valid tool describe perception exertion . Elderly user present Borg 's 15-graded RPE scale immediately completion task ask rate perceive exertion . The predefined usability criterion : The RPE-score 80 % elderly user 14 . This base previous study score 13 RPE associate increase relative risk musculoskeletal symptom . Body Part Discomfort Scale ( BPD Scale ) : The Body Part Discomfort Scale become standard discomfort assessment tool ergonomics research . Elderly user present body map begin immediately completion user trial . The predefined usability criterion : BPD Scale report 80 % elderly user 4 . This base previous study moderate discomfort level body part select threshold redesign consider . Task Analysis : The Perceive , Recall Plan Perform System ( PRPP ) process-oriented assessment employ task analysis method determine problem task performance . For usability study task analysis do elderly user physiotherapist playing game . The major task step analyse identify user struggle game design . The predefined usability criterion elderly user : 80 % elderly user perform 60 % need step without assistance . The predefined usability criterion physiotherapist : 80 % physiotherapist perform 80 % need step without assistance . User Questionnaire : Furthermore objective measurement user ask question feeling opinion game . Especially physiotherapists ask see positive therapeutic aspect could imagine give patient exergames self-training exercise . This do questionnaire include open question five-point Likert scale question . This base publication consider important user positive attitude towards product , ensure regular widespread use . Data analysis : Quantitative data collect review predefined usability criterion specify , use simple descriptive statistic . As sample selective rather random sample size small , statistical calculation likely restrict use median value range . The median use normal distribution data expect consider robust value since influence extreme . Qualitative data present write summary open question questionnaire .</detailed_description>
