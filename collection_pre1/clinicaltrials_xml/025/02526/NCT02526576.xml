	<brief_title>Adipose Derived Stem Cells Facial Fat Grafting</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human Adipose Tissue consider new source Stromal Stem Cells offer large therapeutic potential many rare common disease impact million patient worldwide . The Stromal Vascular Fraction ( SVF ) Adipose Tissue relatively easy extract minimally invasive procedure elective liposuction large quantity therefore may cost effective source cellular therapy wide range medical specialty . The term `` Facial Atrophy '' describe lose subcutaneous fat within face result age process well pathological disease . It correct via autologous fat transfer usually majority grafted cell die 6-12 month . Several publication demonstrate addition SVF cell graft may enhance graft survival . This double blind , randomize study aim demonstrate efficacy Antria Cell Preparation Process autologous facial fat grafting .</detailed_description>
