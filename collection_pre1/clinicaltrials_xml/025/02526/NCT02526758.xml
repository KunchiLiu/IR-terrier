	<brief_summary>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) common disease , characterize progressive development airflow limitation . Small airway disease ( obstructive bronchitis ) lung parenchyma damage ( emphysema ) main mechanism chronic airflow limitation . Research show small airway resistance increase 4-40 time COPD patient , become main part airflow obstruction . Impulse oscillation system ( IOS ) able measure total airway resistance , central airway resistance peripheral airway resistance , widely use assess small airway function COPD patient . While High resolution CT ( HRCT ) easy operate image intuitive . Meanwhile measure proportion emphysema , airway diameter thickness airway wall . Both two test great significance small airway evaluation . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease acute exacerbation ( AECOPD ) acute onset process , characterize aggravation respiratory symptom deterioration pulmonary function . However , structural functional change small airway AECOPD clear . Inhalation drug main treatment stable COPD , inhale corticosteroid（ICS）+long-acting beta2-agonist（LABA） use treat patient severe severe airflow limitation . The particle traditional inhalation drug large mainly deposit large airway , effect small airway function relatively small . The objective investigator study COPD patient . The study divide two part , part AECOPD patient part stable patient . Patients AECOPD arrange take HRCT IOS test ass small airway changes.Patients stable COPD randomize take either beclomethasone / formoterol ( particle diameter 1.4-1.5um ) budesonide / formoterol ( 3.2um ) three month . The structure function change small airway different stage evaluate efficacy two drug compare . This study expect highlight investigator understand role small airway COPD , provide guideline clinical standardize treatment well evaluation patient ' condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The COPD patient investigator hospital select participate investigator study , strict inclusion exclusion criterion comply . All subject tell detail study sign inform consent inclusion.HRCT use evaluate structure small airway measure thickness third stage branch apical segmental bronchus right upper lobe ( WT ) . R5-R20 measured IOS use assess small airway resistance . The study divide two part , part AECOPD patient part stable patient . Both three step . Part 1 . AECOPD patient : - Subjects screen : To inquire history disease take IOS Bronchial dilation test . - Baseline data collection：patients arrange complete series questionnaire , well HRCT , IOS , pulmonary function test 6 minute walk test . - Test stage：During hospital stay , patient treat oxygen inhalation different kind drug , patient follow three week discharge . Completing examination questionnaire time visit , another CT scan last visit . Part 2 . Stable COPD patient : - Subjects screen : To inquire history disease take IOS Bronchial dilation test . - Baseline data collection：In two-week washout period，patients allow take salmeterol/fluticasone 50:250ug 2 time daily , stop use inhalation drug oral glucocorticoid . At end period , complete series questionnaire , well HRCT , IOS , pulmonary function test 6 minute walk test . - Test stage： patient randomize take either beclomethasone / formoterol ( 100:6ug 2inhalations twice daily ) budesonide / formoterol ( 160:4.5ug 2inhalations twice daily ) three months.Completing examination questionnaire end month , another CT scan last visit .</detailed_description>
