	<brief_title>DHACM Robotic Assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy ( RALP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall objective study evaluate effectiveness dehydrate human amnion/chorion membrane ( dHACM ) reduce neurovascular bundle inflammation prostate cancer patient undergo bilateral full nerve spar robotic assist laparoscopic radical prostatectomy ( RALP ) . Specifically , study compare potency outcome patient full nerve spar RALP procedure dHACM application neurovascular bundle full nerve spar RALP without dHACM application neurovascular bundle . Patients randomize one two possible treatment group : - Group 1 - Treatment Group ( Full Nerve Sparing RALP + AmnioFixÂ® ) - Group 2 - Control Group ( Full Nerve Sparing RALP alone )</detailed_description>
