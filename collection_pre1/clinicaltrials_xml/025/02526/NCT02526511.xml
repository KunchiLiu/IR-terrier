	<brief_title>Perfusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging Diagnosing Patients With Kidney Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate utility perfusion magnetic resonance imaging ( pMRI ) diagnostic biomarker prediction malignant vs. benign organ confine renal mass . II . To investigate utility pMRI therapeutic biomarker monitor tumor progression patient undergoing treatment ( ablation , surgery , specific systemic treatment interleukin 2 ( IL-2 ) vascular endothelial growth factor [ VEGF ] /vascular endothelial growth factor receptor [ VEGFR ] /mechanistic target rapamycin [ mTOR ] target therapy ) active surveillance organ confine metastatic renal tumor . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To investigate utility pMRI predict tumor grade histologic subtype organ confine kidney cancer . OUTLINE : Patients undergo dynamic contrast enhance ( DCE ) , dynamic susceptibility contrast ( DSC ) , arterial spin label ( ASL ) pMRI within 30 day biopsy surgery . Patients organ confine tumor select active surveillance surgery patient metastatic renal cell carcinoma undergo follow pMRI 1-6 month . After completion study , patient follow within 48 hour .</detailed_description>
