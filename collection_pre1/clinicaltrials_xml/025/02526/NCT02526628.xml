	<detailed_description>Klinefelter syndrome ( KS ) affect approximately 1 every 600 male , remain severely underdiagnosed . Men KS prone wide range disease include thrombotic disorder . Also , neurocognitive function impair KS . The background increase thrombosis proneness understood , also understood testosterone treatment affect thrombosis risk KS . The effect testosterone treatment neurocognition KS also completely understood . However , speculate testosterone treatment early point could help improve overall neurocognitive performance . In study 30 male KS receive testosterone treatment , 30 male KS receive testosterone treatment 60 match healthy male control include . After initial examination include blood test neurocognitive testing , subject follow 18 month examine second time . After initial examination group previously untreated KS male put standard testosterone treatment accord current guideline . Groups compare measure array marker coagulation fibrinolysis , include thrombin generation fibrin structure analysis , assess haemostatic balance . Also , wide array neurocognitive test brain fMRI apply compare neurocognitive function group .</detailed_description>
