	<brief_summary>This double blind , randomize control trial pretest-posttest control interventional group design . The assessor blind assessment evaluation . All patient subacute stroke undergo in-patient out-patient rehabilitation screen initially series screen test . Suitable patient assign randomly two group respectively . Group 1 experimental group Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( TMS ) trunk rotation ; Group 2 control group trunk rotation train placebo stimulation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness Theta Burst Stimulation ( TBS ) Voluntary Trunk Rotation Neglect</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Methodology Sampling : Convenient sample conduct out-patients stroke refer consecutively occupational therapy department Kowloon Hospital data collection period . Patients meet follow inclusion criterion admit study . Inclusion criteria 1 . First second stroke ( haemorrhagic ischaemic ) confirm computer axial tomography scan magnetic resonance image 2 . Neurological representation compatible unilateral right lesion involvement ( i.e . left hemiplegic ) , exhibit leave visual field inattention neglect follow either one criterion : - obtain total score star cancellation subtest conventional battery Behavioral Inattention Test &lt; 51 ( 54 ) - obtain total score line bisection subtest conventional battery Behavioral Inattention Test &lt; 7 ( 9 ) - Score Catherine Bergego Scale ≥ 1 3 . Right hand 4 . Less six month since onset stroke study entry 5 . Able follow simple command Exclusion criterion 1 . Patients severe dysphasia ( either expressive comprehensive ) restrict communication ; 2 . History neurological disease , psychiatric disorder , alcoholism ; 3. significant impairment visual acuity cause cataract , diabetic retinopathy , glaucoma hemianopia 4 . Any additional medical psychological condition would affect ability comply study protocol . Data Collection Treatment Procedures Written consent obtain subject randomization . All patient experimental placebo group undergo rehabilitation process . Subject 's demographic data collect ; include age , gender , lesion site , educational level , time onset stroke , global cognitive status define Mini-mental State Examination - Chinese version ( CMMSE ) . Repeated measurement do day 0 ( date initial assessment ) , day 10 ( end treatment ) post 4 week . Assessments include Behavioral Inattention Test ( BIT ) - Chinese version , Catherine Bergego Scale , Functional Test hemiplegic upper extremity ( FTHUE-HK ) , Upper-extremity portion Fugl-Meyer Scale ( UE-FM ) , Functional Independence Measure ( FIM ) , Stroke Adapted 30 item version Sickness Impact Profile ( SA-SIP 30 ) score do interval blind assessor . Treatment session experimental group control group conduct trained investigator transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) case therapist . Patients group receive 1 hour conventional treatment Occupational Therapy day . There 3-5 day treatment per week 10 day . The conventional treatment would consist 45 minute voluntary trunk rotation exercise use set-up equipment well 15 minute activity daily live ( ADL ) training . For trunk rotation training , would adopt previous protocol ( Fong et al. , 2007 ) . Voluntary trunk rotation mediate voluntarily rotate trunk 15-35 degree vertical midline toward neglect side within peripersonal space . The crucial element upper trunk initiate rotation activate ipsilesional upper extremity , move across midline body contralesional space visual spatial motor cueing , use traditional set-up apparatus shoulder arc wooden pegboard . The purpose apparatus provide medium within peripersonal space trunk rotation could initiate patient . Trunk rotation perform three different position : supine lie plinth , unsupported sit plinth , stand stand frame intervention could facilitate visual attention postural control rotation trunk toward contralesional side independent position patient . For TMS protocol , make reference protocol develop Cazzoll et al . ( 2012 ) . Continuous theta burst stimulation ( TBS ) apply mean MagPro X100 stimulator ( Medtronic Functional Diagnostics ) connect round coil 60 mm outer radius ( Magnetic Coil Transducer MC-125 ) . In brief , continuous TBS protocol comprise 801 pulse , deliver continuous train consist 267 burst . Each burst contain three pulse 30 Hz , repeat 6 Hz . The total duration one single , continuous TBS train 44s . Overall , eight continuous TBS train apply 2 day . Four continuous TBS train apply Day 1 ( two continuous TBS train interval 15 min , third fourth train 60 75 min first continuous TBS train , respectively ) four continuous TBS train Day 2 ( time interval Day 1 ) . Continuous TBS apply P3 , accord International 10-20 EEG System . This site overlie posterior parietal cortex proximity intraparietal sulcus . The coil hold tangentially scalp , handle point posteriorly , current flow clockwise view . The patient ask close eye continuous TBS application . Continuous TBS deliver 100 % patient ' individual resting motor threshold .</detailed_description>
