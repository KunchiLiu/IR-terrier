	<brief_summary>The purpose research identify genomic marker predict heparin-induced thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) , serious side effect heparin . Heparin commonly use prevent blood clot investigator may able identify genomic marker use prevent heparin use people get HIT .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Inclusion Criteria : 18 year age old ; Ability give informed consent ; Participants heparin/PF4 antibody SRA test HIT , include : participant negative heparin/PF4 antibody negative SRA ( control ) , participant positive heparin/PF4 antibody negative SRA ( seroconversion case ) , participant positive heparin/PF4 antibody positive SRA ( HIT case ) ; Treatment unfractionated heparin low molecular weight heparin ( enoxaparin , dalteparin , tinzaparin ) within 7 day blood draw Exclusion Criteria : Less 18 year age ; Inability give inform consent There randomization involve study . Participants enrol equal number three category : ( 1 ) participant without HIT test negative heparin/PF4 antibody ( control ) ; ( 2 ) participant without HIT test positive heparin/PF4 antibody ( seroconversion case ) ; ( 3 ) participant HIT test positive heparin/PF4 antibody ( HIT case ) . Recruitment facilitate collaborator Department Medicine Hematology key study personnel VUMC Clinical Coagulation Laboratory . Patients positive negative heparin/PF4 antibody serotonin release assay result identify Clinical Coagulation Laboratory patient 's provider approach potential participation research study . If potential participant interested , approach study personnel study description possible consent . Alternatively , clinical collaborator Division Hematology consult participate directly patient care may contact potential participant directly willingness participate study . Patients consent study ask provide one blood sample approximately 150 milliliter . Peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) isolate sample store -80C use propose experiment . Genomic DNA also isolate sample perform HLA sequencing . HIT confirm functional serotonin release assay HIT likelihood base clinical course . Detailed data collect regard participant 's hospitalization , heparin dose duration , platelet count , surgical history , co-morbidities . After consent participant , peripheral blood sample acquire , CD positive T cell sort use flow cytometry , genomic DNA isolate previously describe . The TCR repertoire proportion specific TCR variant particular sample determine use combination novel technology available investigator 's laboratory VANTAGE core facility . The TCR repertoire sample determine use next-generation sequence technology . The new Adaptive Technologies ImmunoSEQ TCR kit likely utilized kit optimize obtain unbiased quantitative profile rearrange TCR allele genomic DNA sample . Currently kit beta test phase VANTAGE one test sit . TCR sequence perform use multiplex PCR system amplify rearrange TCRbeta DNA use primer specific functional TCR Vbeta segment previously describe . Genomic templates amplify observed relative abundance Vbeta 5.1 family TCR clonotypes infer sequence data use expectation maximization algorithm . CDR3 motif define international ImMunoGeneTics information system ( IMGT ) predict base DNA sequence . For every read , best sequence alignment reference sequence compute read low quality score discard . To exclude unspecific T cell due sort impurity and/or stimulation background , antigen-specific clone frequency 1 percent neglect . TCR alleles know important specific DHS target use droplet digital PCR ( ddPCR ) . The ddPCR new technology provide absolute quantification ( real-time PCR provide relative quantification ) target template base oil-emulsion droplet PCR reaction . The investigator 's laboratory experience new technology assay number important TCR allele already optimize ddPCR investigator 's laboratory . To minimize risk extra blood collect study time primary care lab draw whenever possible . Participants ask provide 150ml blood order test qualitative immune response . The risk associate participate study relate uncommon complication venipuncture could include discomfort , bruising , infection , and/or blood clot formation . Patients monitor safety comfort train clinical personnel . Subjects monitor course study adverse event . Serious adverse event report IRB within 10 day PI 's notification event . Non-serious adverse event instance noncompliance protocol report time continue review . The trial monitor ongoing fashion . There DSMB interim analysis plan .</detailed_description>
