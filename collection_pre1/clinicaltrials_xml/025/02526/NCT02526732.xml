	<brief_summary>The aim study examine influence hepatic inflammation damage physical performance ( maximal oxygen uptake , VO2max ) depend histologic state liver . The study population patient fatty liver disease non-alcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) . All study participant obtain individual training plan individual group training session period 8 week . At begin end training phase sport physiological examination carry . In study group effect regular examination survey surrogate parameter liver inflammation .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study plan period 24 month . Study participant twice examine sport physiologically period 12 week . In study group influence regular exercise surrogate parameter liver inflammation investigate study period 8 week . Before exercise study participant subject first physiological examination ( 3 hour ) . This include physical examination detection body weight , waist circumference body fat analysis , venous blood , oral glucose tolerance test , ultrasonography liver determination endothelial function ( flow-mediated vasodilatation , FMD ) Doppler analysis . Within 4 week first examination sport physical examination carry Institute Sports Science University Mainz . This examination contain identification physical fitness individual lactate performance diagnostics . In addition , indirect calorimetry carry exercise condition use spiroergometry determine maximal oxygen uptake ( VO2max ) special emphasis fat metabolism rate low physical activity . Subsequently examination 8-week training period base individual training / performance plan follow . The training plan include independently run exercise 30-45 minute two three time week . Every two week group training session offer accompanied sport physician . Within plan four group train session blood sample take determinate free circulate DNA ass lactate value exercise condition . After train phase , second sport physical examination include physical performance final physiological examination include surrogate parameter liver inflammation carry . For statistical analysis , physical performance study participant examine . Hence patient histologically proven NASH ( NAS score ) confirm inflammation ( increase M30 antigen ) compare age gender match patient histologically proven fatty liver without inflammation reaction well retrospective data healthy subject .</detailed_description>
