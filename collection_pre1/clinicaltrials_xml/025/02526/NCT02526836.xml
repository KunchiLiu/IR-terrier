	<brief_title>Complete Mesocolic Excision With Central Vessel Ligation Compared With Conventional Surgery Colon Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer third common human malignant epithelial tumor still represent second cause cancer death United States Europe . Over past decade , significant improvement treatment patient colonic rectal cancer . In rectal cancer , role earlier diagnosis , improve preoperative staging , neoadjuvant therapy total mesorectal excision improve outcomes oncological patient recovery perspective . Of , arguably important surgeon advent Total Mesorectal Excision ( TME ) . Current think colonic tumor spread via hematogenous , lymphatic , possibly perineural route , lymphatics anatomically follow arterial supply . Current practice excise proportion drain lymphatic bed accurately stage cancer also clear possible lymphatic metastasis . Recently , significant debate center degree lymphatic clearance require ; several report demonstrate improved oncologic outcome wider lymphovascular resection compare current standard practice . Whether improve outcomes secondary improve lymph node yield alternative technical effect yet ascertain . In analogy total mesorectal excision ( TME ) rectal cancer complete mesocolic excision recently introduce curative treatment colon cancer . Like TME , CME aim complete en bloc clearance lymphatic drainage tumor envelop intact fascias embryologic origin . Based total mesorectal excision experience , investigation importance complete mesocolic excision central vascular ligation surgery colonic cancer do compare series complete mesocolic excision central vascular ligation specimen Erlangen , Germany standard excision Leeds , United Kingdom . Lymph node yield , tissue morphometry , grade plane surgery use investigate difference technique could potentially explain relative difference survival . The group Erlangen Germany advocate CME conjunction central vascular ligation colon cancer . Complete mesocolic excision report differ traditional colon cancer surgery achieve far radical excision lymphovascular pedicle mesocolon . In addition , complete mesocolic excision technique promote resection specimen intact visceral peritoneum together proximal distal resection margin least 10 cm . Arterial supply affect segment bowel take origin superior mesenteric artery ( right transverse colon ) aorta ( left colon ) , described central vascular ligation . Complete mesocolic excision show lead increase lymph node harvest mesocolic tissue . In comparison Leeds Erlangen unit , show complete mesocolic excision lead almost double number lymph node retrieve area mesentery resect . However , Danish study show 9 % increase lymph node yield . Surgical concept complete mesocolic excision represent sharp separation undamaged visceral fascia mesocolon parietal fascia peritoneum end goal mobilization mesocolon approach appropriate vascular bundle . The scope surgical intervention depend localization tumor . In case tumor locate right colon next caecum ascend colon , also imply elevation duodenum head pancreas ( Kocher maneuver ) access upper mesenteric vein artery branch . For tumor leave colon , mobilization sigma descend colon necessary , total separation parietal peritoneum , urethra , testicular ovarian blood vessel , well separation kidney fat tissue . The apparent improve outcome complete mesocolic excision yet confirm formal Randomized Controlled Trial ( RCT ) . Proposed explanation apparent improvement increase lymph node yield permit stage migration , increase lymph node yield remove source metastasis , nothing lymphatics due preservation intact peritoneum .</detailed_description>
