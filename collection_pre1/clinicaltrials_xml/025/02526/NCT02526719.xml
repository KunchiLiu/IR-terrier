	<brief_summary>The goal nipple-sparing mastectomy ( NSM ) immediate breast reconstruction reconstruct breast mound preservation patient 's natural skin envelope . Preservation nipple areola complex mastectomy breast reconstruction associate improved quality life well cosmetic result . However , surgical technique relies tenuous blood supply maintain nipple areola . Therefore certain proportion woman actually lose preserved nipple-areolar complex due vascular insufficiency . Furthermore , woman may find nipple-sparing mastectomy cancer invade nipple-areolar complex , would require another operation completely remove cancer . Despite devastate complication , control study investigate mechanism reduce chance occurrence . Our research study use pre-operative minor procedure enhance blood flow nipple-areola complex prior standard nipple spar mastectomy among eligible woman undergo mastectomy breast cancer risk reduction . A secondary objective test many woman actually active cancer nipple time minor surgical procedure , prior standard NSM . The investigator hypothesize innovative novel nipple-delay procedure reduce risk loss nipple due vascular insufficiency may benefit identify small proportion woman nipple-areola complex involvement , order optimize ultimate cancer ablation . For study investigator propose undertake Pilot RCT first step evaluation delay procedure prior NSM , result use determine feasibility inform optimal design definitive RCT . This study question potential set new standard care management woman seek NSM management breast cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nipple Delay Prior Nipple Sparing Mastectomy : A Pilot RCT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The surgical management breast cancer evolve last decade , cancer extirpation become less aggressive parallel advance breast reconstruction . Preservation nipple-areolar complex ( NAC ) time mastectomy ( nipple-sparing mastectomy , NSM ) , represent natural progression within reconstructive surgical oncology preserve maximum native skin oncologically feasible . NSM associate improved satisfaction , body image psychological adjustment . NSM receive increased attention lay medium , ability preserve entire breast envelope appeal patient face decision undergo mastectomy . Clinician attention regard NSM focus oncologic implication residual breast tissue . Several systematic review prospective retrospective study ( level II IV ) conclude NSM impair overall breast cancer specific survival outcome compare skin-sparing mastectomy . This fostered adoption NSM within North America Europe . The rate occult NAC involvement range 6 - 30 % . However , intend purpose NSM preserve NAC may circumvent tenuous sub-dermal blood supply compromise NAC viability . Rates NAC necrosis variable , 0 % nearly 50 % case 5,6 . Few study explore strategy prevent potentially devastating complication . Recent case series employ use surgical delay phenomenon improve vascular supply reduce NAC necrosis NSM 9,10 , however strategy directly compare standard NSM . There controlled study investigate mechanism reduce chance potentially devestating complication NAC necrosis minimize clinical impact occult tumor involvement NAC . Because study pilot feasibility study , 3 specific rationale support design use pilot study first : 1. : Given lack evidence support impair cancer outcome , great interest NSM within breast cancer community . Prior initiate full trial , paramount determine extent intervention provide intend . 2 . There number well-described challenge undertake RCT surgical intervention , extent woman consent participate , maintain randomized treatment allocation adhere study protocol inform whether study feasible large scale . It determine whether candidate NSM would accept additional surgical procedure reduce risk NAC necrosis . Lastly , opportunity identify revise organization protocols prior execution within full trial . 3. : Given wide variation report rate NAC necrosis , important determine incidence NAC necrosis within institution use information generate inform sample size calculation . The direction benefit preliminary estimate effect intervention clarify choice primary secondary outcome feasibility large scale study . The overarch hypothesis drive main trial patient allocate nipple-delay low rate NAC necrosis . Additionally hypothesize may benefit identify small proportion woman nipple-areola complex involvement , order optimize ultimate cancer ablation . Aim 1 : To assess treatment fidelity acceptability surgeon intervention Hypothesis : This pilot RCT acceptable surgeon , surgeon adhere treatment group ( surgical procedure ) patient randomly allocate . Aim 2 : To determine feasibility acceptability patient randomization , treatment uptake retention data-collection Hypothesis : This pilot RCT feasible implement acceptable patient , result inform plan main study . Aim 3 : To estimate proportion patient treatment control group develop NAC necrosis ( primary outcome ) preliminary estimate effect intervention NAC necrosis ( primary outcome ) , occult cancer intra-operative NAC perfusion ( secondary outcome ) . Hypothesis : This pilot study provide important information regard treatment effect estimate variability ( standard deviation ) use guide design sample size calculation main trial . The overarch hypothesis drive main trial patient allocate nipple-delay low rate NAC necrosis . Pilot outcome : Treatment fidelity acceptability surgeon : We record proportion participant receive randomly allocate treatment assignment monitor participant adherence treatment allocation . We record reason deviation study protocol occur ( patient surgeon-driven ) , organizational barrier meet usual care ( ex : &gt; 21 day nipple-delay NSM experimental-group patient ) . Feasibility acceptability randomization , treatment allocation data-collection procedure : Patient recruitment attrition rate record . We measure proportion participant generate complete primary secondary outcome measurement baseline questionnaire . Trial outcome : Primary outcome : We compare proportion patient group develop NAC necrosis , define necrosis require local wound care dressing surgical debridement . The proportion patient group develop total ( &gt; 75 % NAC ) partial ( 25 75 % NAC ) NAC necrosis measure 2 week 4 week definitive NSM procedure treat plastic surgeon surgical oncologist , respectively . We take photographs provide objective documentation . Secondary outcome : 1 . The proportion woman group require secondary NAC excision due positive pathology review NSM retro-areolar nipple core biopsy surgical delay ( intervention group ) definitive NSM ( control group ) . 2 . To include objective immediate measure NAC perfusion , compare mean perfusion score NAC group use indocyanine green infusion SPY Imaging System ( Lifecell Corp. ) immediately tissue expander implant placement skin closure NSM . We use objective measure perfusion influence clinical decision making regard NAC viability . For pilot , study significant generate high-quality evidence-based data determine feasibility undertake complete full-scale RCT . The overarch study potential influence clinical practice contemporary management patient undergo mastectomy breast cancer risk reduction . If nipple-delay effective reduce rate NAC necrosis , propose intervention potential change clinical practice surgeon treat woman breast cancer high risk development . Furthermore , identification occult malignancy within NAC prior plan NSM may contribute improved cancer outcome spar NAC time mastectomy . We hypothesize positive outcome would engender support within breast cancer community uptake additional stage . Therefore , propose study use model incorporate level I evidence plastic surgery research community , well provide robust data support change clinical practice improve patient outcome among woman undergo NSM breast cancer risk-reduction .</detailed_description>
