Females childbearing potential must negative urine pregnancy test Screening willing additional pregnancy test study . Females consider childbearing potential include menopause least two year prior Screening , tubal ligation least one year prior Screening , total hysterectomy bilateral salpingooophorectomy 10 . Participants child‐bearing potential partner childbearing potential undergone bilateral salpingo‐oophorectomy sexually active must consent use effective method contraception determine site investigator ( i.e . oral hormonal contraceptive , patch hormonal contraceptive , vaginal ring , intrauterine device , physical doublebarrier method , surgical hysterectomy , vasectomy , tubal ligation , true abstinence ) period follow signing informed consent 12 week last dose study drug 11 . Must , opinion investigator , willing able complete aspect study , adhere study visit schedule comply assessments 12 . Must complete least 4 7 day patient diary Baseline visit . 1 . Use pharmacologic vitamin D metabolite analog ( calcitriol , doxercalciferol , paricalcitol ) within 14 day prior Screening Visit 2 2 . Use oral phosphate within 14 day prior Screening Visit 2 3 . Use aluminum hydroxide antacid , acetazolamides , thiazide within 7 day prior Screening Visit 2 4 . Chronic use systemic corticosteroid define 10 day previous 2 month 5 . Corrected serum calcium level ≥ 10.8 mg/dL ( 2.7 mmol/L ) Screening Visit 2 6 . Serum intact parathyroid hormone ( iPTH ) ≥ 2.5 upper limit normal ( ULN ) Screening Visit 1 7 . Use medication suppress parathyroid hormone ( PTH ) ( cinacalcet example ) within 60 day prior Screening Visit 1 8 . Use oral bisphosphonates 6 month 2 year prior Screening Visit 1 9 . Planned recommend orthopedic surgery within first 24 week clinical trial period 10 . History traumatic fracture orthopedic surgery within 6 month prior Screening Visit 1 11 . Use KRN23 , therapeutic monoclonal antibody within 90 day prior Screening Visit 1 12 . Use investigational product investigational medical device within 30 day prior Screening Visit 1 , requirement investigational agent prior completion schedule study assessment . OR , Japan , use investigational product investigational medical device within 4 month prior Screening , requirement investigational agent prior completion schedule study assessment . 13 . Pregnant breastfeed Screening /Baseline plan become pregnant ( self partner ) time study 14 . Unable unwilling withhold prohibit medication throughout study 15 . Presence history hypersensitivity , allergic anaphylactic reaction monoclonal antibody KRN23 excipients , judgment investigator , place subject increase risk adverse effect . 16 . Prior history positive test human immunodeficiency virus antibody , hepatitis B surface antigen , and/or hepatitis C antibody 17 . History recurrent infection predisposition infection , know immunodeficiency 18 . Presence malignant neoplasm ( except basal cell carcinoma ) 19 .
