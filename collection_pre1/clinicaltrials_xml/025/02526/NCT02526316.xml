	<brief_summary>The study include 10 patient HPV-associated ano-genital cancer ( cervical , vulvar , vaginal , penile , anal ) HPV-associated head neck cancer , plan receive cisplatin-based chemotherapy ( alternatively carboplatin-based chemotherapy may select investigator choice ) . Patients receive P16_37-63 peptide ( 100 µg ) combine Montanide® ISA-51 VG subcutaneously week four week , follow 4 week rest period ( 1 cycle ) . The vaccination start one week initiation continuation cisplatin-based chemotherapy . Concurrent radiation allow document . The vaccination schedule repeat total 3 cycle ( = 6 month ) progression intolerable toxicity . If chemotherapy withheld ( e.g . toxicity ) , vaccination treatment continue .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cisplatin-based Chemotherapy Combined With P16_37-63 Peptide Vaccination Patients With HPV-positive Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>10 patient HPV- p16INK4a-positive cervical , vulvar , vaginal , penile , anal head neck cancer enrol . The p16INK4a-peptide ( p16INK4a-37-63 , 100 mcg ) mix MONTANIDE ISA-51 VG ( 0.3 ml ) administer subcutaneously weekly four week , follow 4-week rest period ( 1 cycle ) . This schedule repeat total 3 cycle ( = 6 month ) tumor progression intolerable toxicity document . The first application do one week chemotherapy initiation continuation . Concurrent radiation allow document . If chemotherapy withhold toxicity , vaccination treatment continue . Patients see baseline/screening every visit safety assessment disease progression discontinuation trial therapy reason . Immunological assessment make patient . The immunological assessment include delayed time hypersensitivity response ( DTH ) P16_37-63 peptide . Therefore week 1 , 9 , 17 25 , 30 mcg P16_37-63 peptide solution without MONTANIDE ISA-51 VG inject separate site vaccination site intradermally . Immunological response evaluate baseline vaccination week 9 , 17 25 ( ELISPOT ) week 1 , 3 , 9 , 11 , 17 , 19 25 ( ELISA ) compare antigen-specific immune response measure vaccination ( week 1 ) . Radiological tumor assessment ( CT , MRI ) perform baseline every 8 week ( every cycle ) . There follow- visit four week last vaccination safety . Further follow-up regard progression death perform , e.g . via phone call . Autoimmunity assess every 8 week . Safety immunization analyze assessed number severity adverse event categorize accord CTC criterion</detailed_description>
