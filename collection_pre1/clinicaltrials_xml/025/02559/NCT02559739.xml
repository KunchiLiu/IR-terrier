	<brief_summary>Deficient sleep duration sleep disturbance - insomnia , sleep disorder breathing ( SDB ) restless legs syndrome ( RLS ) - associate hypertension cardio-cerebrovascular morbidity mortality . Several study suggest sleep disorder frequent stroke detrimental stroke outcome . However , prospective study large unselected sample stroke survivor need well investigate short- long-term consequence sleep disturbance mortality occurrence new cardio-cerebrovascular event . Also pathophysiological mechanism influence stroke recovery well understood . Therefore , aim study assess impact sleep deficiency sleep fragmentation frequency new cerebro- cardiovascular event death stroke transient ischemic attack , clinical outcome within one two year stroke . The working hypothesis stroke survivor sleep deficiency sleep fragmentation due insomnia , sleep-disordered breathing restless leg syndrome present : ( 1 ) high mortality cause high frequency new cardio-/ cerebrovascular event ; ( 2 ) less favorable clinical outcome . Outcomes compare patient without sleep deficiency fragmentation . Since current clinical practice cerebrovascular patient sufficiently consider sleep disorder patient 's management , study help bring attention still overlook medical problem change current standard management stroke survivor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sleep Deficiency Stroke Outcome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Experimental clinical data suggest detrimental effect sleep deficiency/sleep fragmentation stroke outcome . In rodent , sleep fragmentation sleep deprivation induce acute phase stroke enhance extension lesion impair functional recovery - inversely , sleep-promoting drug positive effect functional recovery . In human , negative effect sleep deficiency sleep fragmentation due sleep-disordered breathing ( SDB ) , restless legs syndrome ( RLS ) insomnia stroke outcome also suggest insufficiently test . SDB find 50-70 % patient transient ischemic attack acute ischemic stroke . Patients SDB demonstrate rapid progression stroke severity well high blood pressure long hospitalization acute phase stroke . Over time , also exhibit high mortality . Functional outcome also negatively affected presence SDB . Moreover , SDB show represent independent risk hypertension cardiovascular morbidity mortality , stroke . The frequency insomnia patient stroke prospective study achieve 68 % acute phase decrease 49 % 18 month . However , systematic large scale observational study frequency insomnia stroke patient lack . Sleep duration stroke assessed study ( e.g . patient paramedian thalamic stroke ) , good correlation actigraphic measurement find . Moreover , last three decade link find sleep deficiency fragmentation cardiocerebrovascular morbidity mortality base epidemiological data . In particular , short sleeper ( e.g . sleep duration &lt; 6 hour ) poor sleeper ( report non-restorative sleep ) present high risk cardiovascular event include death , coronary heart disease stroke . Insomnia sleep duration general population also report predispose increase risk hypertension , cardiovascular event mortality . A high association RLS stroke demonstrated study . RLS find 12 % 137 patient stroke predicted bad outcome . Few case report report high number periodic limb movement sleep ( PLMS ) , often associate RLS , stroke patient . An association RLS/PLMS hypertension , cardiovascular disease stroke also discuss recent year . However , large scale data impact RLS stroke outcomes lack . The possible mechanism link sleep deficiency , poor sleep sleep fragmentation cardiovascular disorder ( include stroke ) multiple include elevate sympathetic activation , procoagulatory inflammatory change , increase atherosclerosis , change cerebral hemodynamics oxygenation . However , clinical relevance association clinical outcome need investigation . Objective The aim study assess impact sleep deficiency sleep fragmentation result insomnia , SDB RLS frequency new cerebro- cardiovascular event stroke TIA include death cause , clinical outcome within one two year stroke . Primary objective study assessment frequency all-cause deaths new cerebro- cardiovascular event within 24 month stroke transient ischemic attack patient without sleep deficiency/fragmentation . The main secondary objective assessment clinical outcome 12 month stroke patient without sleep deficiency/fragmentation . Methods Patients acute ischemic stroke TIA recruit two Neurology Departments Switzerland ( Inselspital Bern &amp; Neurocenter Southern Switzerland Lugano ) . Two group form base presence absence sleep deficiency/fragmentation assess one month follow stroke questionnaire telephone interview . Examinations ( baseline &amp; 3 , 12 24 month follow stroke ) include standardize validated questionnaire assess stroke outcome ( independence activity daily live ) well insomnia , RLS , risk sleep apnea , depression apathy . Additional non-invasive physiological assessment perform every fifth recruit patient acute phase stroke 3 12 month . They include ambulatory blood pressure measurement wrist activity assess 24h physical activity pattern 3 week , assessment arterial stiffness/endothelial function basic cognitive performance .</detailed_description>
