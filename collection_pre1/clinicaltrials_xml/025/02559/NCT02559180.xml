	<brief_title>Treatment Diabetic Macular Edema With Aflibercept Subjects Previously Treated With Ranibizumab Bevacizumab</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study investigator initiate interventional study subject diabetic macular edema previously treat bevacizumab ranibizumab . Intravitreal aflibercept 2mg give OCT ( ocular coherence tomography ) demonstrate absence fluid . Continued intravitreal aflibercept 2mg take place every 2 month total 24 month treatment . This study interventional , single arm , investigator initiate study . Subjects give 2 mg ( 0.05 mL 50 microliters ) IAI injection administer monthly OCT demonstrate evidence fluid define protocol , follow 2 mg ( 0.05 mL ) every 2 month . Each subject evaluate 24 month . Thus , study duration 24 month plus recruitment period . Subjects evaluate safety , efficacy measure SDOCT best correct visual acuity ( BCVA ) use Electronic Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( E-ETDRS ) protocol . In additional , fundus photography , fluorescein angiography , OCT angiography perform baseline , month 6 , month 12 final visit . Only one eye per subject may enrol study . If subject 's fellow ( non-study ) eye require treatment study entry , subject 's participation study , fellow eye receive IAI injection DME .</detailed_description>
