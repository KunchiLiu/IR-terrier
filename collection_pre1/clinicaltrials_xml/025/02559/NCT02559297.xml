	<brief_summary>This prospective interventional study aim compare sevoflurane desflurane anesthetic agent regulatory T cell ( Treg ) number cytokine production patient undergo Living Donor Kidney Transplant ( LDKT ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Sevoflurane Desflurane Treg</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) need renal replacement therapy , either dialysis kidney transplantation . Dialysis , despite effectiveness prolong ESRD patient ' life , burden . Successfulness kidney transplantation restore good quality life ESRD patient . However , one important complication lead transplant failure graft rejection . It already know pathophysiology rejection immune response . Recent evidence show regulatory T cell ( Treg ) play central role prevent graft rejection inhibit recipient alloimmune response ( 1-3 ) . Characterization Treg number and/or functional change various condition may lead new preventive measure and/or novel therapeutic strategy graft rejection . Kidney transplantation conduct general anesthesia . Interestingly , several agent use general anesthesia also modulate immune function ( 4-12 ) . Although effect inhalation anesthetic agent leukocyte count show , effect Treg function totally unknown . Knowing effect inhalation agent Treg number function beneficial intraoperative management transplant surgery , aim toward reduce risk graft rejection future .</detailed_description>
