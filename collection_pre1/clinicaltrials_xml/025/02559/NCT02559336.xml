	<brief_title>Pilot Study SPaRK ( Supportive Palliative Care Review Kit ) Model Care Advanced Cancer Patients Who Have Unplanned Admission Singapore General Hospital</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aims ========== This pilot study Supportive Palliative care Review Kit ( SPaRK ) model care , integrate palliative care oncology care advance cancer patient , focus improve outcomes lung cancer patient acute hospital inpatient setting . The current usual care provide first 3-month period 1 October 31 December 2015 , novel SPaRK model care pilot latter 3-month period 1 January 31 March 2016 . The overall aim pilot study facilitate plan upcoming phase III trial . Specific aim 1 : To estimate recruitment rate data completion rate FACT-G instrument We estimate recruitment rate data completion rate FACT-G , demonstrate feasibility help planning future Phase III trial . The measurement property FACT-G detail later 'Methods ' section proposal . The FACT-G questionnaire administer four time point - day 1 , 4 7 hospital admission day discharge . Specific aim 2 : To obtain tentative estimate effect size SPaRK change FACT-G day 1 day 7 hospital admission The control group hospital admission manage current model care . The intervention group hospital admission manage new SPaRK model care . We hypothesize SPaRK model care result great improvement FACT-G score day 1 day 7 hospital admission . Specific aim 3 : To explore responsiveness change FACT-G day 1 day 4 hospital admission Within three-day period day 1 day 4 hospital admission , expect acute problem prompt admission address . The patient 's 'phase illness ' record primary medical oncology physician day 1 day 4 part study protocol . For patient change 'unstable phase ' day 1 'stable phase ' day 4 , estimate responsiveness change FACT-G score term association change . Even though FACT-G us recall period seven day , hypothesize FACT-G score nonetheless increase among patient change 'unstable phase ' 'stable phase ' short time period three day day 1 day 4 hospital admission change FACT-G score among patient remain 'unstable phase . This would useful measure outcomes patient discharge day 7 hospital admission . Specific Aim 4 : To explore view healthcare professional regard SPaRK model integrate palliative care oncology care service delivery Semi-structured interview conduct among purposive sample healthcare professional , management key decision maker involve pilot study . We explore view integrate palliative care oncology care deliver acute hospital inpatient setting , whether SPaRK acceptable model provide care . Methods ======= Study set This study conduct Singapore General Hospital ( SGH ) , 1,597-bedded acute hospital 78,000 admission per year . About 5,000 hospital admission per year DMO , 70 % unplanned admission advance cancer patient , mean length hospital stay 7.2 day . These inpatient care one four Division Medical Oncology ( DMO ) team broadly organize tumor site -gastrointestinal ( GI ) , lung , breast lymphoma . In current model service , inpatient DMO team decide patient would benefit palliative care input , would request review Division Palliative Medicine ( DPM ) team . The DPM team provide palliative care ( PC ) review patient make suggestion patient management , patient remain care DMO . Study design This cluster-controlled study 1 control cluster 1 intervention cluster , patient admission episodes unit inference . The control cluster comprise patient admission episode occur 3-month control period ( 1 October 31 December 2015 ) current model care place ; intervention cluster comprise patient admission episode subsequent 3-month intervention period ( 1 January 31 March 2016 ) SPaRK model care place . Study patient This pilot study conduct DMO lung team cohort patient high percentage target population - advanced cancer patient ( 86.0 % ) unplanned hospital admission ( 84.6 % ) . Furthermore , patient DMO lung team also high unplanned readmission rate ( 11.8 % within 7 day , 35.3 % within 30 day ) , surrogate marker unresolved palliative care problem . All advanced cancer patient unplanned admission lung team 6-month period 1 October 2015 31 March 2016 include . In first 3-month period 1 October 31 December 2015 , current usual care provide baseline data collect . The novel SPaRK model care pilot latter 3-month period 1 January 2016 31 March 2016 . Inclusion criteria - 21 year old - Has unplanned admission SGH care inpatient DMO Lung team - Has cancer diagnosis stage 4 solid tumor - Has capacity give write informed consent participate study ( patient complete patient questionnaire ) Exclusion criterion - Unable complete self-administration FACT-G questionnaire The SPaRK intervention The SPaRK intervention pilot DMO lung team latter 3-month period ( 1 Jan 31 Mar 2016 ) . All advanced cancer patient unplanned admission SPaRK model care receive palliative care , provide DMO team conjunction palliative care advanced practice nurse ( APN ) part-time specialist palliative care ( PC ) physician integrate member DMO team ( DPM/DMO SPaRK team . It envisage PC physician spend average 2 hour per weekday discussing case APN , review select case person participate weekly team meeting medical oncology team inpatient list discuss . In current model care , patient refer DPM PC also discuss weekly team meeting establish plan care . The component palliative care ( PC ) provide control group DPM team intervention group DPM/DMO SPaRK team include assessment physical symptom , functional status , psychosocial issue spiritual issue , follow formulation problem list establishment care plan . If patient complex palliative care need meet SPaRK team , either DMO consultant , palliative care APN palliative care physician trigger formal referral DPM team review . Data collection instrument Patients complete FACT-G questionnaire ( Available English , Chinese [ simplify ] , Malay Tamil validate translation use ) . The doctor charge complete 'phase illness ' Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) score . We use FACT-G measure primary outcome patient 's health-related quality life ( QOL ) establish instrument well-validated internationally locally patient many kind cancer . It low level noise , evidence reliability measure consistently show 0.8 0.95 , suitable comparison group . 21 , 22 , 24 As compare popular alternative cancer QoL research , FACT-G show sensitive detecting difference group . It cover four QOL domain : physical well-being ( 7 item ) , social/family well-being ( 7 item ) , emotional well-being ( 6 item ) functional well-being ( 7 item ) , item response choice 5-point Likert-type scale . We adopt official scoring method , part validate instrument demonstrate good measurement property aforementioned . Response score negatively phrased question reverse high score always mean good QOL . The domain score obtain sum individual item score within domain , subject imputation item non-response `` half-rule '' , i.e . miss item score replace average score subscale 50 % item subscale answer . It show half-rule robust Singaporean cancer patient participate FACT-G assessment item non-response imputable half-rule . The total FACT-G score sum four domain score . The FACT-G questionnaire administer four time point : T1 - day 1 hospital admission ; T2 - day 4 hospital admission ( patient discharge ) ; T3 - day 7 hospital admission ( patient discharge ) ; T4 - day discharge . The standard administration method FACT-G self-report . Hence self-administration chosen mode questionnaire completion . As evidence FACT-G equivalent self-administration interviewer-administration , use interviewer-administration study . At time point , patient 's 'phase illness ' also record . The standard definition five phase : Phase 1 - Stable : patient problem symptoms adequately control . Phase 2 - Unstable : urgent change plan care emergency treatment require patient experience new problem anticipate exist plan , care and/or patient experience rapid increase severity current problem , and/or family/carers circumstance change suddenly impact patient care . Phase 3 - Deteriorating : care plan address anticipated need require periodic review gradual worsen exist problem new anticipate problem . Phase 4 - Terminal : death likely within day . Phase 5 - Bereavement : patient die . The 'phase illness ' used determine responsiveness change FACT-G , specifically patient change 'unstable phase ' 'stable phase ' . The following demographic data background information also collect : age , gender , ethnicity , primary cancer diagnosis , stage cancer Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status score . The ECOG score set standard criterion measure disease impact patient 's daily living ability describe patient 's level functioning term ability care themself , daily activity , physical ability ( walk , work , etc. ) . The following data patient obtain computer system : - Hospital length stay - Discharge destination ( e.g . home , nursing home , inpatient hospice ) - Referral DPM admission date referral DPM - The presence plan follow community palliative care service upon discharge hospital ( include outpatient palliative care clinic , home hospice , day hospice inpatient hospice ) - The occurrence another unplanned hospital admission within 7 day 30 day discharge hospital These outcome reflect usage acute hospital community palliative care resource use decide outcome would suitable study future Phase III trial . Data analysis sample size plan Recruitment rate data completion rate FACT-G It estimate 95 eligible patient admission per month ( base data May 2013-June 2014 ) , thus approximately 280 patient admission 3-month control period 280 patient admission 3-month intervention period , totally 560 eligible patient admission . We assume , average , one patient may 1.5 admission study period , intra-class correlation coefficient outcomes measure two admission 0.5 . This imply design effect 1.25 take account sample size planning allow cluster data within patient . This study update percentage eligible patient admission , recruitment rate data completion rate measure outcomes . A total 560 eligible admission six month ( effective sample size 450 discounting design effect ) allow u accurately estimate consent cum data completion rate 95 % confidence interval approximately +/- 4 % . Effect size SPaRK change FACT-G day 1 day 7 hospital admission ( T1 T3 ) Assuming 25 % consent cum data completion rate FACT-G T1 ( day 1 hospital admission ) T3 ( day 7 hospital admission ) , would approximately 75 patient admission control group intervention group ( total 150 patient admission ) complete FACT-G time point . This sample size would provide 80 % power 20 % 1-sided Type 1 error rate detect effect size 0.3 ( PASS 13 software ) . Responsiveness change FACT-G day 1 day 4 hospital admission ( T1 T2 ) Sensitivity change test ability instrument detect important change time concept measure . For patient change 'unstable phase ' T1 ( day 1 hospital admission ) 'stable phase ' T2 ( day 4 hospital admission ) , estimate sensitivity change FACT-G score T1 T2 . We hypothesize FACT-G score improve patient whose phase illness change 'unstable phase ' T1 'stable phase ' T2 significant change FACT-G score among patient remain 'unstable phase ' period . Views healthcare professional regard SPaRK model integrate palliative care oncology care service delivery Healthcare professional involve pilot study invite participate one-to-one interview . Purposive sampling use . Heads department DMO , DPM nursing division also include . The format interview semi-structured , participant ask discuss response follow question : ) How think integrate palliative care oncology care deliver acute hospital inpatient set ? ii ) What think SPaRK model possible way deliver integrated palliative care oncology care advance cancer patient ? iii ) How SPaRK model modify improve effectiveness provide integrate palliative care oncology care ? iv ) What perceive role palliative care nurse palliative care doctor oncology team ? v ) Do think SPaRK model implement ? The interview audio-taped transcribed verbatim . Written note also take interview . Interview transcript analyze use framework analysis . Conclusion ========= This pilot study SPaRK - novel model integrate palliative care oncology care advance cancer patient unplanned hospital admission . The overall aim pilot study establish feasibility larger-scale Phase III trial SPaRK . If successful , pilot study help design plan subsequent phase III trial , test potentially viable well effective way provide early palliative care advance cancer patient acute hospital inpatient setting .</detailed_description>
