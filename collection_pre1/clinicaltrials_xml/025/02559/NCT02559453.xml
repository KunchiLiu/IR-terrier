	<brief_summary>We design study determine whether perform two , compare ≥3 operation effect key clinical outcome discharge hospital infect wound require admission . Each arm study represent two commonly practice standard care treatment plan patient present infected wound . It currently unknown SoC option provide best patient outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Outcomes 2 Operations Versus ≥ 3 Operations Infected Wounds</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There lack consensus whether patient infect wound require 2 surgical procedure . For patient admit infected wound study investigate whether 2 , compare ≥3 , operative intervention result well outcomes . All patient admit infected wound assess eligibility study . If eligible , subject randomize Cohort A ( 2 operative visit ) Cohort B ( ≥3 operative visit ) . Subjects followed hospitalization well 180 day post discharge . A total 250 subject enrol study . Two operation ( n=125 ) compare ≥3 operation ( n=125 ) hospitalization . We compare follow factor two treatment group : length hospital stay ; readmission post-discharge ; quality life ; proportion wound close covered graft ; culture result ; host factor ; environmental factor post-hospital discharge ; , financial charge relate admission readmission . We expect full enrollment take 3 year duration . Debridement wound perform customary manner per SOC operate room . Prior start study , surgeon perform operation require view video demonstrate standardized debridement technique utilized . The following standardized technique depict video : All wound surface paint dye prior debridement . Debridement involve use scalpel , scissors , curette , rongeur , hydro-surgery . A 2-3 millimeter skin edge around perimeter wound also resect . All infected/nonviable tissue remove tissue dye surgically remove . This include decompression purulent material excision indurate tissue ( tissue pliability establish ) . Nonviable tissue include necrotic fibrous tissue . Debridement perform bleed wound base perimeter .</detailed_description>
