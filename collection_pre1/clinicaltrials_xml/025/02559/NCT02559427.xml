	<detailed_description>Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome ( OSAS ) , characterize repetitive episode partial complete upper airway ( UA ) obstruction , highly prevalent general population ( 2 % woman , 4 % men ) . OSAS associate hypersomnolence increase risk cardiovascular morbidity mortality . Its pathogenesis largely multifactorial . In patient chronic venous insufficiency , fluid retention contributes pathogenesis : day , fluid accumulates legs due gravity ; sleep recumbent position , accumulate fluid redistributes rostrally neck cause upper airway narrow predisposes OSAS . The hypothesis comprehensive treatment program chronic venous insufficiency ( SPA therapy ) would reduce sleep apnea patient chronic venous insufficiency concomitant sleep apnea Syndrome . The objective ass efficacy 3-week SPA therapy attenuation sleep apnea population patient .</detailed_description>
