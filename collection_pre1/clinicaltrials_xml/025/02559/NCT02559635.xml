	<brief_title>Does Bowel Stimulation Before Loop Ileostomy Closure Reduce Postoperative Ileus ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Low anterior resection total mesorectal excision standard operative treatment mid low rectal cancers.The dread morbid complication procedure anastomotic leak , varied incidence 3-32 % , result pelvic abscess sepsis , re-operation , death.The creation loop ileostomy measure prove reduce morbidity septic complication anastomotic leakage . With current trend towards sphincter-preserving surgery performance ultra-low anastomosis low rectal cancer , anastomotic dehiscence increasingly observed.That , addition frequent use neoadjuvant radiotherapy contribute great use divert ostomy . Furthermore , use protective loop ileostomy limit oncologic surgery , often perform colonic resection complicate diverticular disease . However , formation loop ileostomy come price require second surgery typically 12 week initial operation restore intestinal continuity . The incidence complication follow ileostomy closure certainly negligible , highly variable range 11-45 % . A systematic review 48 study include 6,107 case report 17.3 % morbidity rate 3.7 % re-operation rate . Of complication , postoperative ileus ( POI ) commonly observe morbidity follow ileostomy closure , rate typically report 15-32 % . POI lead increase patient discomfort , postoperative morbidity , prolong hospital stay , increase risk nosocomial infection , ultimately high health care cost . Transient gut dysmotility expect abdominal surgery . However , case ileostomy , defunctionalized segment bowel undergoes series structural functional change may increase time take motility resume closure . Studies perform animal show defunctionalization ileum lead atrophy villi muscular layers.This confirm human Williams et al. , demonstrate significant loss muscular contractility atrophy intestinal villus follow creation divert ileostomy.Oh et al . also reveal low concentration peptide YY secrete mucosa ileum colon distal loop ileostomy , function inhibit gastric motility promote water electrolyte absorption colon.Thus , absorptive capacity colon reduce follow reconstruction bowel . It would appear change defunctionalized segment bowel might leave functionally unprepared intestinal transit , contribute development POI . A group Spain propose preoperative stimulation exclude intestine might reverse change improve absorptive motor function prior restore intestinal continuity , thus reduce incidence POI.They publish randomize control trial 70 patient , 35 patient underwent daily stimulation thicken saline-based solution via efferent limb ileostomy two week . Following ileostomy closure , observe reduce rate POI , earlier return oral intake passage flatus stool , short hospital stay group patient underwent stimulation . While result promise , single-institution study European patient population , perhaps limit generalizability practice . Furthermore , randomization allow equal distribution confounders amongst two group , report electrolyte imbalance , narcotic use , variable know influence development POI . Miedema colleague group apply similar technique bowel stimulation ileostomy closure , find benefit intestinal absorptive function postoperative bowel function . However , six patient stimulate group , undergone restorative proctocolectomy ileoanal J pouch , thus short segment distal ileum stimulate . The idea stimulate defunctionalized bowel reduce POI theoretically plausible , lack evidence . To knowledge , study would first kind North America , would complement work do Europe.The potential benefit intervention numerous , include patient 's overall postoperative outcome , postoperative course potential two-day reduction length stay associate health care cost . If finding observe , use preoperative bowel stimulation could incorporate Enhanced Recovery After Surgery ( ERAS® ) pathways patient undergo ileostomy closure . The aim study evaluate impact preoperative stimulation defunctionalized intestine loop ileostomy postoperative outcome follow ileostomy closure . Investigators hypothesize preoperative stimulation defunctionalized intestine via efferent limb reduce rate postoperative ileus follow ileostomy closure . This multicenter randomize control trial involve patient 4 university hospital . Patients recruit individual surgeon , explain objective study obtain informed consent obtain consent ileostomy closure . All patient undergone anterior low-anterior resection neoplastic ( benign malignant ) diverticular disease protective loop ileostomy fully trained colorectal/general surgeon surgical oncologist one involve site offer enter study . Patients underlie Crohn 's disease , know metastasis time ileostomy closure patient clear informed consent obtain exclude . The current overall rate POI follow ileostomy closure involve institution 16 % . Based previously publish study clinical experience , investigator estimate absolute risk reduction POI 13 % . With alpha 0.05 , power 0.80 estimate 5 % loss follow-up , 83 patient require arm total 166 patient . At participate institution , least 35 ileostomy closure eligible study perform per year . Assuming 70 % participation rate , investigator anticipate able recruit 122 patient per year 5 institution involve , thus require 1.4 year complete study . In order mitigate loss follow-up , patient receive phone call , instruction equipment home stimulation unable come stimulation session . Block randomization perform use computer-generator sequence , ensure initial surgical approach colorectal resection ( open vs. laparoscopic ) equally distribute two group . Group allocation conceal treat surgeon researcher involve study ( except research assistant stimulation session ) . All patient enrol study follow preoperative protocol . Upon agree participate study , patient randomize either stimulation group non-stimulation ( control ) group.The protocol stimulation identical patient . Stimulation perform daily outpatient basis two week ( ten business day ) prior ileostomy closure.The efferent limb ileostomy loop canalize 18 Fr Foley catheter infuse solution comprise 500mL normal saline mixed 30g thickening-agent ( Nestle Resource ) . It prepare five 100mL syrinx administer slowly 20 minute . All surgery perform attend colorectal surgeon assistance one General Surgery resident . Perioperative antibiotic include one dose cefazolin 1g intravenously metronidazole 500mg intravenously prior surgery . Procedures perform general anesthesia , similar operative technique use case . A parastomal incision make carry sharply peritoneal cavity . Adhesiolysis conduct intestinal continuity restore side-to-side functional end-to-end enteroenteral staple anastomosis.The intestine return abdominal cavity . Fascia close interrupt run sutures.The fascia infiltrate 20mL 0.25 % bupivacaine , skin close purse-string suture cover dry dressings.Patients give patient-controlled analgesia post-anaesthesia care unit postoperative analgesia . Epidurals use . Any operation necessitate conversion laparotomy incision due technical difficulty intraoperative complication exclude analysis . All patient follow perioperative Enhanced Recovery After Surgery ( ERAS® ) protocol elective colorectal surgery already implement involve site . Specifically , protocol allows clear fluid diet postoperative day 0 , low-residue diet morning postoperative day 1 . If well tolerate , patient progress regular diet later day . Patients also encourage chew gum ambulate . Criteria grant discharge home hospital include follow : 1. tolerate oral diet ; 2. overt abdominal distension ; 3. adequate pain control ; 4. absence fever sign surgical site infection ; 5. ambulate baseline ; 6. passage flatus stool . Blood work , include CBC electrolyte ( extend electrolyte ) , draw daily postoperative day 1,2 , 3 , clinically indicate . All electrolyte abnormality correct . Nurses record narcotic use patient chart , convert morphine equivalent use equianalgesic table time data collection . A trained , blind assessor ( physician researcher colorectal research fellow ) prospectively collect postoperative clinical data history , physical examination , chart review . This assessor blind stimulation vs. control group assignment preoperative information . Data regard patient demographic specific primary surgery collect prospectively , include indication approach use colorectal resection , length time ileostomy creation closure , use neoadjuvant adjuvant treatment case colorectal cancer . All postoperative data collect prospectively research assistant . The primary outcome postoperative ileus , define intolerance oral food absence clinical radiological sign obstruction , either ) last 72 hour ; b ) require nasogastric tube insertion ; c ) associate 2 following : nausea/vomiting , abdominal distension , absence flatus . Secondary outcome include length stay , time tolerate regular diet , time first passage flatus stool , overall morbidity . Lastly , analysis additional risk factor postoperative ileus perform . All statistical analysis perform use JMP® 11 statistical discovery software ( SAS Institute Inc. , Cary , NC,1989-2007 ) . Patient characteristic , clinical variable , POI postoperative outcome compare two group use Chi-square , student 's Wilcoxon rank sum test categorical , normally distribute continuous non-normally distribute continuous variable , respectively . Statistical significance consider p &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
