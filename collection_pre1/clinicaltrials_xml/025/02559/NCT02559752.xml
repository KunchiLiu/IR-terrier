	<brief_summary>This study explore neurocognitive performance pediatric brain tumor patient receive proton beam radiation therapy ( PBRT ) . The investigator goal gather baseline neurocognitive test prior completion first week radiation therapy along follow-up test 6-12 month completion radiation serial annual testing thereafter . With data investigator plan evaluate effect PBRT neurocognitive performance relate patient ' age diagnosis , tumor location , radiation dose . Modeling study demonstrate PBRT could improve neurocognitive outcome , paucity prospectively-collected patient data . The investigator uniquely position address important question give busy pediatric central nervous system ( CNS ) tumor service , delivery proton therapy S. Lee Kling Proton Therapy Center Barnes-Jewish Hospital , multi-disciplinary research team extensive experience late effect therapy relate neurocognition .</brief_summary>
