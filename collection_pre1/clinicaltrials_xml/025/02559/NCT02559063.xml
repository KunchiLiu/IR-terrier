	<brief_summary>This project seek identify neural change occur adult mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) engagement computerize cognitive training . In addition , project aim identify physiological factor may bolster effect train cognitive function . Individuals MCI high risk Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) . Understanding cognitive training protects cognitive function MCI contribute development effective intervention slow progression AD individual risk , thereby reduce significant morbidity health care cost associate AD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mild Cognitive Impairment ( MCI ) , especially amnestic type , consider symptomatic pre-Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) phase , prevalent age population . Vision-based speed processing ( VSOP ) cognitive train one widely apply behavioral intervention community-dwelling old Americans free AD , hold potential slow cognitive decline . Its particular relevance MCI support converge evidence preliminary study , include recently complete pilot intervention study . However , know little mechanisms underlie benefit VSOP training , limit ability exploit VSOP form cognitive training . In particular , know effect VSOP train cognitive performance mediate neuroplasticity-related brain change . Since recent evidence suggest neuroplasticity inducible throughout adult life , even MCI , possible VSOP training promote neuroplasticity slow neurodegeneration . In early stage new investigator application , focus assess whether VSOP training , relative mental leisure activity ( MLA ) , alters cognitive neural function older adult MCI , 6 month train . The study enroll randomize 84 participant amnestic MCI VSOP train MLA control group . Three specific research aim ( 1 ) determine whether VSOP train improves process speed attention associate change brain structural functional connectivity ; ( 2 ) test novel neurophysiological pathway VSOP training effect brain structure function ; ( 3 ) examine effect VSOP training untrained cognitive functional domain role neurophysiological change underlie possible transfer effect . By examine multiple neural novel physiological mechanism link promise VSOP train intervention improvement cognitive performance , application seek challenge shift current research cognitive training merely examine train effect cognitive outcome . Discovery neural , physiological-related mechanism VSOP training important implication beyond particular intervention . Findings recent behavioral study ( e.g. , cognitive intervention , physical exercise , nutrition , bio-feedback intervention ) suggest cognitive decline mitigate individual risk AD , necessary intervention target neural peripheral physiological pathway susceptible AD neuropathology . Confirmation study hypothesis could support immediate translation clinical practice demonstrate efficacy , sustainability , generalizability cognitive training .</detailed_description>
