	<brief_title>Virtual Surgery : Construction Training Program Analysis Significant Factors Operating Performance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Operations retina removal vitreous body ( vitrectomy ) procedure rapid growth . Demographic mix rapidly increase incidence lifestyle-related disease diabetes mellitus lead increase operational need [ 1 ] . Causes vitrectomy include bleed vitreous eye , retinal detachment , hole macula retina ( macular hole ) removal connective tissue ( epiretinal membrane ) macula . Vitrectomy previously associate high risk therefore perform special case , recent year operational result markedly well - least due introduction technological advance small good instrument . Nevertheless , type operation surgeon require long training increase risk operative complication early stage . For reason , virtual surgery suit help training maintain operational skill [ 2 , 3 ] . Research Unit Ophthalmology Odense University Southern University receive 2007 grant Velux Foundation obtain EyeSi ( eye surgical simulator ) Surgical Simulator ( VRMagic Gesellschaft mit beschr√§nkter Haftung ( GmbH ) , Mannheim , Germany ) . This surgical eye simulator subsequently great joy eye surgeon across country use machine train maintain operating procedure . The machine use train cataract operation , well responses eye 's posterior section ( vitreoretinal surgery ) surgery vitreous body retina . There increase research activity within EYESI-based virtual eye surgery [ 4-6 ] , far reserve training cataract operation . The investigator , example , previously could demonstrate repetitive training cataract surgery promote surgical learn enhance qualification future eye surgeon [ 7 ] . Subsequently , another Danish group publish proposal specific simulation pas requirement [ 8 ] , simulation training subsequently introduce part training future cataract surgeon country . There previously publish research virtual vitreoretinal surgery , nevertheless vital well surgical training . The vitreoretinal training module include exercise vary degree difficulty numerous area Navigation Training , Forceps Training , Anti-Tremor-Training , bimanual Training , bimanual Scissors Training , Laser Coagulation , Posterior Hyaloid Training , Epiretinal Membrane Peeling , Internal Limiting Membrane ( ILM ) Training Retinal Detachment . Due many potential exercise important develop vitreoretinal training program include relevant module right level difficulty . One main requirement program exhibit high construction validity [ 9 ] . Meaning program must able measure want , case surgical skill group different level competence . It must , word , possible differentiate train vitreoretinal surgeon untrained surgeon . From possible develop reference score , program implement surgical training course . Many surgical disorder - retinal detachment - progress time , often know ideally operate [ 10 ] . On one hand , may best operate early thereby reduce risk disease progression surgery . On hand , also important take account factor presence correct operational expertise well surgeon 's fatigue stress level . Conditions last-mentioned clearly difficult test clinically virtual surgery thus allow design study safely allow test condition sleep deprivation operational distraction . Purpose : The purpose study 1 ) facilitate training future vitreoretinal surgeon introduce virtual training program high construction validity , 2 ) clarify external condition affect performance train operator use virtual training program . Substudy A : From train session , simulation manual guidance vitreoretinal surgeon , proposal virtual vitreoretinal training program compose include relevant module appropriate degree difficulty . This program test follow three group : 1 . Group train vitreoretinal surgeon ( n = 5 ) . 2 . Group future ophthalmologist train ( n = 10 ) . 3 . Group medicine student limit knowledge anatomy pathology ( n = 20 ) . Each group go program twice one two week apart , result second training session determine . Subsequently individual module construct validity evaluate , assume give module exhibit high construction validity , median score group 1 high group 2 , turn high Group 3 ( test Cuzicks test trend ) . Modules high construction validity include final model . Substudy B : Based constructed program substudy A , five subject go intensive train program , terminate achieve target score Group 1 substudy A . The target score use reference subsequent exercise . The subject conduct train program influence follow operational challenge : 1 . Operation non-dominant hand . 2 . Operation auditory distraction . 3 . Operation nighttime sleep . 4 . Operation 12 hour fast solid food . 5 . Operation 24 hour sleep deprivation . It calculate five program , result modify test score compare score target ( tested Wilcoxon match sign rank sum test ) .</detailed_description>
