	<brief_summary>Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) emergent non-invasive treatment treatment resistant depression ( TRD ) . The exact neuro-functional mechanism relate TMS efficiency remain however unknown ; besides local effect target , TMS may induce interaction change remote cerebral region . On hand , study perform comparison sham placebo stimulation . The investigator recently show non-responder depressive patient TMS exhibit deep wider brain functional abnormality hardly reachable standard coil . The H1-Coil novel TMS ( H-TMS ) device capable induce magnetic field deeper wider distribution standard coil . The investigator design randomize controlled study investigator compare clinical effect H-coil TMS standard TMS patient TRD , functional neuroanatomical correlate change connectivity Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) . The general objective good understand mechanism relate TMS efficiency pharmacoresistant depression , order propose best therapeutic approach patient .</brief_summary>
