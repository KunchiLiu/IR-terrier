	<brief_summary>In study , investigator seek evaluate effect cannabidiol ( CBD ) cocaine crave relapse . Cocaine addiction characterize compulsive substance use repetitive urge consume drug even sustain period abstinence . While substance use remain obvious direct outcome addiction , grow interest core symptom disorder . Craving become subject great interest reliable intermediate phenotype cocaine relapse distress symptom addiction associate suffering . Indeed , even period abstinence , cocaine-dependent individual remain vulnerable stress craving-inducing stimulus , , turn , lead intense physiological response various negative feeling anger sadness . Real-time daily monitoring crave drug use show crave predicts cocaine relapse among cocaine-dependent individual . In sum , work toward improve treatment craving could help prevent relapse , also reduce patient distress emotional , cognitive , physiological level . In past decade , significant scientific effort deploy toward development innovative strategy beat cocaine addiction , partial success thus far . Psychosocial approach widely use help cocaine-dependent patient achieve good outcome drug cessation , literature indicate strategy alone times insufficient induce significant behavioural change reduction rate drug consumption . Unlike type addiction , opioid alcohol , pharmacological treatment yet find truly effective relieve cocaine-cessation symptom like crave anxiety prevent relapse . CBD natural cannabinoid favourable tolerability profile discrete neurobiological action link neural circuit closely involved addiction disorder . Addiction cocaine characterize alternate phase intoxication short abstinence , follow recurrent drug-craving episode result distress relapse . Our hypothesis CBD cannabinoid know broad spectrum property interest pharmacological contender decrease cocaine crave treat cocaine addiction . Previous study conduct animal human confirm CBD safe tolerable medication .</brief_summary>
