	<brief_title>Comparison Bleeding Risk Between Rivaroxaban Apixaban</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently develop new oral anticoagulant ( OAC ) overcome limitation establish therapy vitamin K antagonist ( VKA ) low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) treatment acute venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) , due ease administration predictable pharmacokinetic property . Many clinical question new OAC remain unanswered direct head-to-head comparison trial . For example , although study show rivaroxaban apixaban least effective safe LMWH VKA , meta-analyses suggest apixaban may associate low bleeding risk . Concerns potential impact medication non-adherence raise . Compliance twice daily medication ( e.g . apixaban ) often bad daily medication ( e.g . rivaroxaban ) . Both medication approve Health Canada treatment VTE yet genuine uncertainty two direct OAC confer best risk-to-benefit ratio.This multi-centre , prospective randomize open blind end-point ( PROBE ) trial assess clinical feasibility large multi-centered trial compare bleed outcome use apixaban vs. rivaroxaban treatment acute VTE . The primary objective study determine feasible conduct large randomize multicenter trial compare apixaban vs. rivaroxaban treatment acute VTE . The secondary objective assess safety superiority apixaban vs rivaroxaban .</detailed_description>
