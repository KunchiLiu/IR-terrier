	<brief_title>Anti-OX40 Antibody ( MEDI6469 ) Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There three distinct cohort patient vary time MEDI6469 dose , start three week surgery decrease interval surgery one week cohort , long dose-limiting toxicity attributable anti-OX40 observe . Immunohistochemistry used measure immune cell within primary metastatic tumor resect tissue available , surgically ablated tumor , give specimen `` immune score '' . The primary endpoint study difference immune score patient treat anti-OX40 compare historical control ( immune score untreated patient ) . Secondary endpoint include clinical ( survival ) immunological data ( specific measurement immune cell population base flow cytometry immunohistochemistry ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients undergo stag liver resection include study . In case , preoperative MEDI6469 give prior initial procedure . Patients small &lt; 3 cm tumor locate &gt; 2 cm away central bile duct consider either radiofrequency ablation resection , choice determine time surgery . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 Laboratory value preoperative assessment within protocol specify range Ability give inform consent comply protocol . Patients history psychiatric illness must judge able understand investigational nature study risk associate therapy . No active gastrointestinal bleeding . No clinical laboratory coagulopathy Anticipated lifespan great 12 week Metastatic disease outside liver consider surgically resectable curable . Active infection . Active autoimmune disease include patient Inflammatory Bowel Disease determine autoimmune questionnaire . Previous treatment mouse monoclonal antibody . Need chronic maintenance oral steroid . Any medical psychiatric condition opinion PI would preclude compliance study procedure . Enrollment clinical trial different investigational agent administer within 4 week prior first dose MEDI6469 .</criteria>
