	<brief_summary>The Nexfin monitoring system offer complete non-invasive approach continuously estimation blood pressure , CI PPV mean finger-cuff base pulse contour analysis . Several clinical investigation prove reliability interchangeability Nexfin technology yield acceptable result especially regard trend ability . At present evidence available , whether early goal direct hemodynamic optimization protocol base completely non-invasive monitoring technology able reduce postoperative complication . Therefore , aim single-center study compare clinical outcome postoperative complication patient undergo major colorectal surgery treat standard care GDT protocol base Nexfin technology .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The Nexfin™ monitoring system able provide continuous beat-to-beat stroke volume index ( SVI ) , stroke volume variation ( SVV ) , pulse pressure variation ( PPV ) , cardiac index ( CI ) arterial pressure use inflatable finger cuff . This system consist frequency dependent transfer function calculation brachial artery pressure finger artery pressure . Major surgery bares risk conceal hypoperfusion therefore possible mismatch oxygen delivery oxygen demand . It must note , `` basic '' perioperative monitoring , i.e . electrocardiogram , oxygen saturation non-invasive invasive blood pressure measurement able accurately detect hypovolemia ongoing organ hypoperfusion . Perioperatively , patient undergo major abdominal surgery prone high risk hemodynamic instability consequently relevant change oxygen delivery , associate increase postoperative complication length stay hospital . Over last year several study focus early goal direct hemodynamic therapy ( GDT ) strong proof feasibility algorithms improvement patient 's outcome respect certain clinical scenarios.However , still debate regard individualized GDT approach , base pre-procedural defined individualize hemodynamic goal yield advanced haemodynamic monitoring technology . We distinguish monitor system , invasive non-invasive , match kind estimate risk time best .</detailed_description>
