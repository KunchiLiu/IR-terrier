	<brief_summary>This study evaluate different method early exposure influenza ( natural infection , live attenuate influenza vaccination , inactivate influenza vaccination ) initially stimulate immunity poise immune system respond future challenge inactivate influenza vaccine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose research address fact , despite high childhood morbidity influenza broad recommendation vaccination , little known anti-influenza immunity shape method initial exposure . The objective research understand CD4 T cell B cell response alter method initial influenza priming , long-term goal determine child 's initial influenza encounter poise immune system respond subsequent influenza challenge . The investigator central hypothesis difference mode influenza antigen exposure early childhood generate long lasting , detectable change memory CD4 T cell specificity function influence response future influenza vaccination infection . This hypothesis test compare 1 ) CD4 T cell 2 ) antibody responses cohort child initially expose influenza either natural infection inactivate live attenuated vaccination . A combination multiparameter assay use determine phenotype functional potential hemagglutinin ( HA ) - nucleoprotein ( NP ) -specific CD4 T cell . The breadth avidity neutralize antibody response distribution head stalk epitopes also evaluate . By determine initial prim shape specificity functional potential anti-influenza CD4 T cell antibody response , investigator gain knowledge necessary optimize current influenza vaccination strategy develop novel influenza vaccine able provide highly efficacious universal protection seasonal potentially pandemic viral strain .</detailed_description>
