	<brief_summary>The propose study add grow understanding platelet activity platelet inhibition subject HIV . It examine relationship platelet activity inhibition antiplatelet therapy ( aspirin monotherapy clopidogrel monotherapy ) high-risk cohort . Furthermore , provide important data mechanism platelet activity inhibition use biomarkers platelet activity , inflammation , immune activity endothelial function genetic expression profiling .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>There substantial evidence risk serious non-AIDS condition , cardiovascular disease , kidney disease , liver disease , non-AIDS-defining malignancy , increase person HIV infection compare general population . HIV-induced activation inflammatory coagulation pathway implicate increase risk . However , causative mechanism link HIV , inflammation , increase risk non-AIDS disease poorly describe . The investigator interested study link HIV induce inflammation cardiovascular disease . Inflammation mediate many aspect disease pathogenesis atherosclerosis , involve diverse cell type mediate signal . Specifically , platelet implicate atherosclerosis pro-inflammatory thrombogenic effect . Moreover , clinical study demonstrate importance platelet activity coronary artery atherosclerosis thrombosis . Whereas great understanding pathogenesis cardiac disease , wide knowledge gap understand mechanism cardiovascular disease patient HIV . A recent study investigator demonstrate platelet activity heighten subject HIV . Following 1-week low-dose aspirin , platelet activity inhibit . A surprising finding study demonstrate antiplatelet therapy 1 week aspirin ( 325mg dose x1 day follow 81mg daily ) improve immune activity subject HIV . The current study perform replicate finding compare control group . Moreover , remain unknown find specific aspirin whether result attribute antiplatelet effect drug . Clopidogrel another antiplatelet therapy target P2Y12 receptor ( different mechanism aspirin ) show low risk cardiovascular event various clinical setting . The dos aspirin clopidogrel investigator employ test hundred study well-known benefit risk . The investigator believe understand mechanistic role platelet inhibitor set HIV help uncover new strategic pathway HIV pathogenesis . Also , subject HIV increase risk cardiovascular event understand platelet inhibition aspirin clopidogrel help establish good design future trial aim prevent event HIV infect person . The investigator demonstrate platelet activation increase HIV infection attenuate low-dose aspirin non-randomized study without control group . Therefore , Specific Aims study establish follow : - The effect aspirin versus control marker platelet activity , inflammation , immune activity , endothelial function . - The effect Clopidogrel versus control marker platelet activity , inflammation , immune activity , endothelial function .</detailed_description>
