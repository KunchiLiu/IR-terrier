	<brief_title>Prospective Study Registry Peripheral Neuroblastic Tumours Presenting With Spinal Canal Involvement ( SCI )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multi-centre , observational , prospective study registry . About 15 % patient peripheral neuroblastic tumour present extradural SCI , approximately 60 % symptomatic . Since SCI may progress irreversible paraplegia , early diagnosis prompt treatment critical importance.1-3 The treatment option include chemotherapy , neurosurgical decompression radiation therapy . All may relieve epidural compression , consensus use first individual patient . However , choice treatment could relevant perspective reduce minimum risk long-term sequelae.4 Guidelines diagnostic work-up treatment SCI International Society Paediatric Oncology European Neuroblastoma ( SIOPEN ) neuroblastoma patient already available `` guideline treatment patient localize resectable neuroblastoma analysis prognostic factor '' ( LNESG1 Protocol ) , back 1994,5 although unknown applied SIOPEN Centres . These guideline reformulate occasion recently activate `` European Low Intermediate risk Neuroblastoma '' ( LINES Protocol ) . There publication address diagnosis treatment SCI ; retrospective study , case report , review may affect report bias.1-9 Therefore new guideline could design base information derive prospective data collection newly diagnose patient . For study Spinal Canal Involvement ( SCI ) define , refer axial plane spinal cord MRI scan ( Figure 1 ) , tumour extend vertebral canal go beyond mentally drown ellipsoid ( red circle ) pass cortical bone anterior posterior arch vertebra . This involvement call `` intraspinal '' , good , `` intracanal '' . Patient data collect include correspond Forms 1. work-up diagnosis , include radiology report ( Computed Tomography Magnetic Resonance Imaging ) 2. treatment administer 3. response treatment , include radiology report 4. follow-up 5. outcome</detailed_description>
