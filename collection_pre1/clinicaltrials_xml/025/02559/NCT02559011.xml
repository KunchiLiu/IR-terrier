	<brief_summary>Transcatheter aortic valve implantation ( TAVI ) emerge valuable minimal-invasive treatment option patient symptomatic severe aortic valve ( AV ) stenosis prohibitive increase risk conventional open-heart surgery . Recent randomize clinical trial report large treatment effect TAVI medical treatment among inoperable patient similar superior outcome compare surgical aortic valve replacement high intermediate risk patient . However , atrio-ventricular conduction disturbance arrhythmias ( particular atrial fibrillation ) , TAVI remain matter concern important consequence . The objective study investigate incidence , nature prognostic significance AV-conduction disturbance arrhythmias among patient severe , symptomatic aortic stenosis undergo TAVI , procedure use small implantable cardiac monitoring system ( ICM ; Medtronic REVEAL LinQTM ) . One hundred patient enrol study . Prior TAVI ( least 4 week ) , time preprocedural hemodynamic anatomical assessment , ICM insert skin chest local anesthesia . The device interrogate prior readmission TAVI thereafter 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month follow-up . The incidence symptomatic well silent brady- tachyarrhythmias record , impact medical device treatment well clinical outcome analyze . The present study provide information actual incidence impact symptomatic silent arrhythmia AV-conduction disturbance among patient severe , symptomatic aortic stenosis undergo TAVI . Specifically , study estimate burden arrhythmia TAVI accurately determine incidence new onset atrial fibrillation complete AV-block within 12 month procedure . Identifying patient risk AV- conduction abnormality , atrial fibrillation ( AF ) , non-sustained sustain ventricular arrhythmia may guide future preventive measure , medical treatment improve patient outcomes TAVI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background TAVI emerge valuable minimal-invasive treatment option patient symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis prohibitive increase risk conventional open-heart surgery . AV conduction disturbance arrhythmias , TAVI remain matter concern consequence . Prior TAVI ICM insert skin chest local anesthesia . The device interrogate prior readmission TAVI thereafter 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month follow-up . The incidence symptomatic well silent brady- tachyarrhythmias record , impact medical device treatment well clinical outcome analyze . All patient severe , symptomatic aortic stenosis undergo TAVI institution irrespective select bioprosthesis include study . Final decision eligibility make local Heart Team . Objective To investigate incidence , nature prognostic significance AV-conduction disturbance arrhythmias among patient severe , symptomatic aortic stenosis undergo TAVI , procedure use small implantable cardiac monitoring system ( ICM ; Medtronic REVEAL LinQTM ) . The primary endpoint study establish incidence new onset atrial fibrillation complete AV-block within 12 month TAVI . Methods One hundred patient severe , symptomatic aortic stenosis undergo TAVI enrol prospective , observational study . Prior TAVI ( least 4 week ) , time preprocedural hemodynamic anatomical assessment , ICM insert skin chest local anesthesia . The device interrogate prior readmission TAVI thereafter 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month follow-up . The incidence symptomatic well silent brady- tachyarrhythmias record , impact medical device treatment well clinical outcome analyze . The study observational : patient assign specific intervention . Patients consent monitor use specific device approve market release . The objective study use information obtain monitoring device ass incidence , nature prognostic significance atrioventricular conduction disturbance arrhythmias among patient severe , symptomatic aortic stenosis undergo Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation , procedure . The objective study investigate performance monitoring device .</detailed_description>
