	<brief_summary>The relationship myopenia , nutritional status , long-term oncologic outcome remain poorly characterized patient anatomically resectable pancreatic cancer ( PC ) . The investigator want look muscle property pancreatic cancer patient determine possible therapeutic option toward good nutritional status . Patients benign right upper quadrant pathology utilized control study . The researcher hypothesize improve cancer cachexia PC improve quality life ultimately increase overall survival . The long term goal identify area intervention prevent and/or improve cachectic event PC order significantly improve clinical outcome . The first step long term goal fully characterize cachexia condition PC . This research understand modify local response within skeletal muscle lead clinically relevant persistent waste understand interrupt systemic stimulus produce tumor local environment result muscle specific mechanism .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Role Muscle Cachexia Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancer cachexia ( CC ) devastate condition affect 80 % cancer patient , diminish quality life contribute increased mortality . Cancer cachexia complex metabolic syndrome characterize loss skeletal muscle mass weakness . The muscle pathology cancer cachexia relate muscle atrophy also disruption contractile apparatus muscle . While physiologic disruption muscle sarcomere myofiber membrane integrity observe despite lack injury , totality muscle specific mechanism contribute phenotype describe , investigated context pancreatic cancer ( PC ) cachexia significant clinical problem . Therefore , delineate specific mechanism muscle catabolism PC critical develop clinical therapy control waste improve patient quality life , clinical outcome long-term survival . A variety tumor promote inflammatory cell signal pathway implicate cancer cachexia , whereby pro-inflammatory cytokine implicate drive force . Remarkably , approximately half patient PC demonstrate measurable acute phase response , associate poor clinical outcome . Importantly , systemic elevation inflammatory mediator due complex local interplay develop tumor immune system subsequently lead systemic chronic inflammatory state . PC appear manipulate immune system promote survival expense nutritional store result cachexia . Therefore , understand local systemic inflammatory response PC relation muscle specific mechanism crucial develop effective therapy cancer cachexia . PC associate cachexia result significant therapeutic dilemma . Local approach surgery curative intent encounter high recurrence rate indicative systemic nature even early-stage disease . Therefore , systemic therapy necessary long-term survival . Unfortunately , effective chemotherapy offer patient good clinical parameter nutritional status . In word , patient weak , offer effective therapy risk cause harm good .</detailed_description>
