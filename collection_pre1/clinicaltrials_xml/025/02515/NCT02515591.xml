	<brief_title>Validating Use Disposable Bronchoscopes Research Bronchoalveolar Lavage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research bronchoscopies traditionally perform use conventional flexible fibreoptic bronchoscope . The technique obtain bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( BAL ) healthy volunteer research purpose develop group since 1999 perform &gt; 1,000 subject UK Malawi include healthy volunteer . Fibreoptic bronchoscopy BAL use manual hand hold suction enables removal non-adherent cell lung line fluid mucosal surface . In research environment , BAL allow sample innate ( lung macrophage ) , cellular ( B- T- cell ) , humoral ( immunoglobulin ) responses within lung . Further application include determine protein drug level , latter key parameter early phase 'lung tissue active ' drug development . The BAL technique use gentle hand-held suction instill fluid ; design maximize BAL volume return , apply minimum shear force ciliated epithelia order preserve structure function cell within BAL fluid . This technique also intend preserve viability facilitate growth cell ex vivo culture . The research technique therefore use large volume warm normal saline instillate ( typically order 200 ml ) employ manual suction reduce cell damage . At Royal Liverpool Hospital ( RLBUHT ) â‰¥120 healthy volunteer BALs perform . Available data suggest 200 ml instillate follow volume yield retrieve : mean 100-120 ml , median 120 - 125 ml ~ 19 % BALs return &lt; 100 ml yield . The preferable BAL volume yield &gt; 100 ml , yield &gt; 150 ml consider excellent ; yield &gt; 170 ml record . There linear relationship cell yield volume yield . Yields &lt; 100 ml experience , likely lead side effect cough , chest pain fever . Subjects yield &lt; 100 ml advise recovered leave lateral position aid postural drainage remain instillate . There serious adverse event ( SAEs ) report ; notably post procedure hospitalisation antibiotic require suspect pneumonia . Single-use flexible intubation bronchoscope use throughout United Kingdom ( UK ) National Health Service ( NHS ) trust . They predominantly use within intensive care anaesthetic ( theatre ) set emergency elective airway intubation . The flexible fibreoptic bronchoscope sterile single-use disposable-sheath endoscope system potential cost-effective reduce risk , however negligible , cross-infection sterilisation procedure . Eliminating need high-level disinfection processing procedure reduce maintenance cost ( equipment staff ) , scope downtime provide flexibility suit research healthy volunteer . The content study proposal peer review two senior research associate base Malawi UK deem scientific review criterion sound . Currently many new drug therapeutic discovery development project blight absence robust predictive pre-clinical model . For example , promise anti-tuberculosis ( TB ) drug drug combination clinically trialled base current vitro vivo model , find lack clinical efficacy ; conversely effective anti-TB drug linezolid poor modest efficacy test usingin vitro vivo model . To mitigate issue therefore develop dynamic pharmacodynamic vitro model base high content image able measure macrophage intracellular tubercular growth kill rate . Pharmacodynamic ( PD ) Pharmacokinetics ( PK ) modelling model closely resemble clinical measurement know first line anti-TB ; therefore wish develop platform physiological model use alveolar macrophage ( AMs ) obtain human subject . The purpose use human AMs compare drug effect know new anti-TB compound human AMs vitro model . This work enable u obtain good , clinically relevant parameter predict outcome drug dynamic . By use AMswe ass reliable current model system , assess consideration drug action clinically relevant tissue sample . These cell manipulate ex vivo desire clinical scenario e.g . dual TB HIV-infections monitoring TB responses time range novel drug novel drug combination . The outputs study use directly inform new clinical trial drug regimen .</detailed_description>
