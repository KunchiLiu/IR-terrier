	<brief_summary>Single-arm , phase 2 study evaluate hypofractionated irradiation breast regional node woman breast cancer . Patients group 3 surgery-related treatment group : 1 ) An intact breast follow lumpectomy ; 2 ) plan loco regional external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) follow mastectomy ( without plan reconstruction ) ; 3 ) plan locoregional EBRT follow mastectomy reconstruction . Patients assess lymphedema , arm function , breast chestwall pain , EBRT-related adverse event , , patient lumpectomy mastectomy reconstruction , cosmetic outcome .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hypofractionated Regional Nodal Irradiation Clinical Trial Women With Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The HeNRIetta Trial phase 2 non-randomized clinical trial evaluate safety effectiveness hypofractionated RNI woman resect node-positive breast cancer . The study hypothesis 3-4 week hypofractionated course post-lumpectomy postmastectomy EBRT safe effective biologically equivalent dose give conventional fractionation 5-7 week . Eligible patient woman â‰¥ 40 year old undergone definitive surgery node-positive breast cancer . Surgery may lumpectomy , mastectomy without reconstruction , mastectomy reconstruction . Nodal staging may perform sentinel lymph node ( SLN ) axillary lymph node ( ALN ) dissection . Patients may receive neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy discretion treat medical oncologist . Breast RNI administer 42.56 Gy 16 fraction . ( RNI exclude axilla patient ALN dissection . ) A treatment boost 4 6 fraction 2.66 Gy/fraction lumpectomy cavity include patient lumpectomy ; chestwall boost ( 4 6 fraction 2.66 Gy/fraction ) administer patient mastectomy ( without reconstruction ) close ( &lt; 2 mm ) surgical margin . Total number EBRT fraction 20 22 boost ; 16 without boost . Bilateral measurement arm circumference use assess lymphedema compare ipsilateral arm contralateral arm . Patients also assess complete questionnaire relate lymphedema , decrease arm function , breast chestwall pain , EBRT-related toxicity , cosmetic outcome , local , regional , distant breast cancer recurrence .</detailed_description>
