	<detailed_description>TITLE OF THE RESEARCH PROJECT A randomized , double-blind control trial bupivacaine extended-release liposome injection post-surgical analgesia patient undergo open-reduction internal fixation distal radius . PROJECT SUMMARY For patient undergo open-reduction internal-fixaton ( ORIF ) isolate distal radius fracture , administration 66.5 mg liposomal bupivacaine operative field may decrease need post-operative narcotic pain medication . STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM Patients undergo open-reduction internal-fixation ( ORIF ) isolate distal radius fracture experience significant post-operative pain , commonly mitigate use narcotic painkiller . Among issue , prolong use narcotic painkiller lead dependence abuse . This potentially lead post-operative narcotic seek habit adult orthopedic trauma patient . THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK There much research support administration liposomal bupivacaine effective post-surgical analgesic . The investigator ' hypothesis 66.5 mg liposomal bupivacaine inject operative field decrease need post-operative narcotic , therefore reduce risk dependence abuse . RESEARCH OBJECTIVE -Assess potential benefit single-dose liposomal bupivacaine ( Exparel ) treatment post-operative pain follow open-reduction internal-fixation isolated distal radius fracture . METHODOLOGY Patients admit University Louisville Hospital isolate distal radius fracture require ORIF eligible . Exclusion criterion follow : 1 ) patient receive narcotic pain medication within past 6 month confirm Kasper report 2 ) Patients compartment syndrome acute carpal tunnel syndrome require surgical decompression 3 ) Patients prior history ipsilateral wrist surgery . Randomization perform use sealed envelope , patient assign number corresponds either Exparel 266mg solution ( 20 ml Exparel 1.3 % plus 40ml injectable saline ) verse 60ml placebo control injection ( 20ml inert liposomal suspension use manufacturing Exparel without bupivacaine plus 40ml injectable saline ) provide Pacira . If inert liposomal solution viable option , blinded/opaque syrinx ( either provide Pacira ( preferable ) create unblinded personnel ) use dispense 60 mL sterile saline . The corresponding solution know participating , unblinded pharmacist provide solution keep participant record , surgeon . The amount narcotic pain medication use recovery room hospital admission record . Patients also provide study log record daily usage prescribe pain medication discharge home . Follow-up phone call make patient 72 hour post-operatively , amount narcotic tablet use record . Patients see clinic 1 week postoperatively , total narcotic pain medication usage document . Passive wrist range motion ( ROM ) tolerance overall satisfaction also assess visit . Demographic data include age , gender handedness record patient . The primary outcome measure total post-operative narcotic pain medication use . Secondary outcome measure passive wrist ROM , overall satisfaction . All subject treat ethically . This include true informed consent , explanation study co-investigator , time ask question study . Patient intake data keep paper form initially keep desk behind lock research office department orthopaedics accessible staff . This data enter password protect computer office paper shred . Once feasible , PHI remove data set . A key PHI separate excel file computer . PLAN FOR ANALYSIS OF RESULTS To detect 30 % difference narcotic pain medication requirement , Cohen 's = 0.4 ( small/medium effect ) require . TIMETABLE The study begin IRB approval obtain continue 1 year .</detailed_description>
