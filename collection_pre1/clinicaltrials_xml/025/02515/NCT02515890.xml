	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine effect pain facilitate long-term auditory memory presence absence two distinct intravenous anesthetic . The ability identify previously present word list ass degree memory formation . In subset subject , functional magnetic resonance imaging use identify neural correlate memory inhibition facilitation combination pain anesthetic use . The primary hypothesis pain enhance memory formation , mediate additional neural pathway compare used encode word pair pain . The study occur 4-5 visit involve long-term follow .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study add specific detail current incomplete body knowledge examine effect pain memory formation influence anesthetic agent . Pain common surgery , prevent memory procedure fundamental goal anesthetic care , awareness anesthesia cause life-long psychiatric disturbance . However , currently available monitor always detect patient risk awareness memory anesthesia . This largely due incomplete description circumstance favor memory formation versus effectively inhibit . Pain two anesthetic agent administer experimental variable study . Healthy adult subject play repeated list word perform several decision-making task encourage memory encoding . Some word consistently pair painful electric shock , anticipate improve subsequent memory performance specifically item . The experiment repeat subject administration two agent reduce memory formation : dexmedetomidine , predominantly sedative agent , midazolam , well-known amnestic agent . The extent pain modulates sedative amnestic effect two anesthetic agent primary outcome interest . The memory facilitation due pain hypothesize great dexmedetomidine . Psychometric test stress , anxiety , depression , sleepiness perform subject , regression analysis use determine may explain commonly observed inter-individual response variability pharmacologic sedation amnesia . Further , subset subject perform experimental procedure undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging , continuously reflect neuronal activity throughout brain . Classic memory area predict activated auditory processing task , neural circuit change two anesthetic agent concomitant experience pain interest . It anticipate pain recruit parallel memory pathway use limbic structure , know involvement fear conditioning . Additionally , strong diffuse cortical processing likely occur concomitant pain , level sedation reduce strong stimulus . Discovering anatomic correlate specific experimental variable ( pain anesthetic ) , interplay , refine investigator ' model brain function dynamic surgery may someday allow predictive monitoring .</detailed_description>
