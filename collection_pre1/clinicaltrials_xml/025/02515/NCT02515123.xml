	<brief_summary>Early enteral feeding key component management critically ill patient receive mechanical ventilation . However , enteral feeding associate serious complication gastro-esophageal reflux , overt micro pulmonary aspiration , potentially increase risk nosocomial pneumonia . Many critically ill patient experience poor tolerance early enteral nutrition impair gastric motility , lead sequence delay gastric emptying , increase gastric volume , gastro esophageal reflux , vomit , aspiration , VAP . Early adequate enteral feeding ICU patient correlate decreased overall infection rate , ventilator intensive care unit ( ICU ) day , cost , mortality . This study intend assess efficacy safety E-Motion System ( i.e . E-Motion tubeTM E-Motion EPG 1000TM ) improve tolerance enteral nutrition induce esophageal motion mean electrical stimulation ICU patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Malnutrition ICU know cause increase morbidity mortality provide artificial nutrition part standard care ICUs worldwide . While malnutrition risk factor adverse outcomes related critical illness , difficult prove value optimal amount nutrition . Nevertheless , large-scale observational study critically ill patient suggest optimal amount timely provision nutritional intake associate reduce infectious complication , duration mechanical ventilation , mortality , along perception faster physical recovery . Smaller RCTs demonstrate great nutrition intake associate improved wean mechanical ventilation large RCTs suggest non-significant improvement long-term physical functional performance ( 6 minute walk test 12 month ) significant improvement 60-day quality life . In contrast , large-scale RCTs fail demonstrate positive treatment effect enhance nutritional intake . However , trial criticize study heterogeneous group low 'nutritional-risk ' patient . Patients benefit optimal nutritional supplementation high-nutritional risk . Recent data suggest tolerate 80 % prescribed amount protein calorie associate improved clinical outcome may serve quality indicator ICU practice . Currently , around world , 75 % nutritionally-high risk patient systematically underfed receive less 80 % prescribed amount . Thus , investigator conclude great effort improve nutrition intake ICU patient warrant . Early enteral nutrition ( EN ) support mechanistic data delineate physiologic effect , provide non-nutritional nutritional benefit critically ill patient . EN start soon possible follow admission ICU order achieve non-nutritional benefit minimize development protein-calorie deficit frequently occur first week critical illness . The non-nutritional benefit derive several physiologic mechanism maintain structural functional gut integrity , prevent increase intestinal permeability . Immune mechanisms elicit EN result attenuation oxidative stress inflammatory response support humoral immune system . Enteral feeding modulates metabolic response help decrease insulin resistance . The nutritional benefit derive delivery exogenous nutrient , provide sufficient protein calorie , deliver micronutrient antioxidant , maintain lean body mass . Because many factor impede delivery early EN ICU setting , patient routinely get approximately 50 % calorie protein require . Our mission , E-Motion Medical , improve outcome critically ill patient lower risk infection enable good nutritional intake . To achieve , novel technology develop reduces gastric reflux promotes GI motility , via electric stimulation esophageal mucosa . The investigator believe technology improve gastric emptying , reduce reflux aspiration gastric content , enable adequate delivery enteral nutrition critically-ill patient predispose delayed gastric emptying .</detailed_description>
