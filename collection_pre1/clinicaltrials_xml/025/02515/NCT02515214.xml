	<brief_summary>The use bariatric surgery risen subsequently last decade , especially woman reproductive age . ( Unplanned ) pregnancy subgroup rare e.g . increase fertility ( weight loss ) possible ineffectiveness contraceptive ( malabsorption intestine ) . Although pregnancy bariatric surgery generally know safe , study indicate pregnancy bariatric surgery always without complication , consider high risk pregnancy . The research pregnancy outcomes type surgery rather limit small , mainly retrospective , observational case-control cohort study limit amount case study . For risk- prognose related issue , e.g . effect bariatric surgery fertility , time pregnancy , development complication pregnancy pregnancy outcome , large prospective cohort study need . Besides , breast feeding practice breast milk composition scarcely investigated population . The energy content breast milk could possibly influence state malabsorption procedure . Low amount vitamin B12 also notice breast milk woman surgery . The overall objective study establish group woman reproductive age ( age 18-45 ) history bariatric surgery generate extensive database future analysis . The final goal researcher develop guideline recommendation manage pregnancy bariatric surgery , base large-scale prospective research . The study design multicentric observational prospective cohort study . Participants follow moment surgery 6 month postpartum include several time point ( surgery , surgery ( &lt; 12 month ) ; surgery ( &gt; 12 month ) pregnancy ) . Both retrospective prospective data concern medical background , fertility ( menstrual cycle ) , lifestyle ( e.a . food , physical activity , smoking , sleep ) , blood sample , psychological factor ( fear depression ) , sexuality , quality life pregnancy outcomes collect .

	<detailed_description>The investigator aim develop guideline recommendation management pregnancy bariatric surgery base large-scale prospective research . The investigator want : 1. investigate pregnancy outcome woman history bariatric surgery accord procedure , interval surgery conception , weight change surgery pregnancy nutritional status , take account possible confounding factor economic status , alcohol tobacco use , sleep duration , psychological factor ( anxiety depression ) quality life 2. determine incidence nutritional deficiency ( pregnant ) woman reproductive age bariatric surgery . 3. evaluate effect bariatric surgery ( morbidly ) obese woman reproductive age anthropometry , fertility , sexuality , co-morbidities , use medication contraceptive , pregnancy outcome , quality life , psychological factor ( anxiety depression ) , blood biochemical parameter ( nutritional status ) , food intake physical activity 4. examine breastfeeding practice ( intention , initiation , duration ) breast milk composition woman history bariatric surgery The study multicentric prospective cohort study UZ Leuven coordinate central cite AZ St Jan Brugge ( obesity clinic obstetric clinic ) , AZ St Lucas Brugge ( obstetric clinic ) , AZ St Nikolaas St Niklaas ( obesity clinic ) , UZ Gent ( obesity clinic obstetric clinic ) , AZ St Augustinus Wilrijk ( obstetric clinic ) CHRH Mons Hainaut ( obesity clinic obstetric clinic ) local site . The design breast milk analyse longitudinal , practical reason , initiate UZ Leuven UZ Gent . The investogators collect breast milk sample 10 ml day four postpartum weekly participant home routine 6 week postpartum consultation . Women include one follow four inclusion moment ( IM ) : - Before surgery ( woman reproductive age morbid obesity ) ( IM1 ) - After surgery pregnant ( IM2 ) - Before 15 week gestation ( IM3 ) - Day 3 4 postpartum breast milk analysis ( IM4 ) A simple , user-friendly website use simplify collection entry data create large database . Researchers able directly continuously register patient data ( replace paper form ) participant able complete questionnaire online . The database available via secure online login . Participating researcher access patient database . For breast milk analysis , investigator wil collect sample 10 ml first feed moment ( 8 11am ) day four postpartum manually use vacuum pump . Each sample divide two different recipient . One part sample freeze immediately freezer -20 °C . The rest sample immediately heat +40 °C use bottle warmer . As soon sample heat , ultrasonically analyze MIRIS Sonicator® order ensure sample homogeneous . Immediately afterwards , sample analyzed Human Milk Analyzer ( HMA ) ( MIRIS ® , Uppsala , Sweden ) fat ( g/100 ml ) , proteins ( g/100 ml ) , carbohydrates ( g/100 ml ) , dry matter ( g/100 ml ) energy ( kcal/100ml ) . The sample collect participant ' home freeze -20° afterwards analyze HMA . There eleven measurement point : T0 = baseline T1 = pre-operative T2 = 3 week post-operative T3 = 3 month post-operative T4 = 6 month post-operative T5 = 12 x month post-operative T6 = first trimester pregnancy T7 = second trimester pregnancy T8 = third trimester pregnancy T9 = pregnancy T10 = 6 week postpartum T11 = 6 month postpartum The number measurement varies accord moment inclusion . 1 . Demographical data collect ( T0 ) ( participant self-reporting ) . Age , nationality , ethnicity , marital status , family status , educational level , employment status profession wil question . 2 . Anthropometric data , include body weight , waist circumference , hip circumference body fat percentage ( measure ) collect measurement point record researcher . The body length question first measurement . Body height body weight use calculate Body Mass Index ( kg/m² ) measurement point . 3 . During first measurement investigator ask past medical condition ( report researcher ) obstetric history ( gravidity , parity , abortion - self-report participant ) ; 4 . The type procedure , date surgery institute surgeon record investigator first measurement ( Reported researcher ) . Potential problem complication report next measurement point . ( T1-T5 ) . 5 . Current medical condition ( eg hypertension ) report measurement point , together use medication ( Reported researcher ) . 6 . The nutritional status participant assess investigator basis biochemical parameter venous blood . The nutritional status newborn assess basis biochemical parameter venous umbilical cord blood . ( total protein albumin , fasten glucose level , fat soluble vitamin A , 25 -hydroxy- vitamin D , vitamin E vitamin K1 , water soluble vitamin B1 , vitamin B12 folate ( serum red blood cell ( RBC ) , iron , ( + transferrin , transferrin saturation , ferritin ) , calcium , zinc magnesium , hematology ( hemoglobin , hematocrit RBC count , mean corpuscular hemoglobin ( MCH ) , mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration ( MCHC ) , mean corpuscular volume ( MCV ) ) , coagulation ( prothrombin time ( PT ) activate partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) ) . During measurement time T1 , T3 , T4 , T5 , blood sample take department endocrinology T6 , T7 , T9 T10 department obstetrics-gynecology . 7 . Investigators ask participant alcohol , tobacco sleep habit ( self-report participant ) . The alcohol consumption ask use AUDIT-C questionnaire ( Alcohol Abuse Disorder Identification Test ) . If participant smoke , amount cigarette tobacco product smoke daily record . At begin pregnancy , participant ask whether alcohol tobacco use change . Finally , sleep duration also determine . 8 .
