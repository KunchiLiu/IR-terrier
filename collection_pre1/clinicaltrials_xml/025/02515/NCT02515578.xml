	<detailed_description>Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) cause one three death report year United States . Strategies derive patient-centered outcome research ( PCOR ) address CVD risk factor greatly reduce burden CVD . Primary care practice must transform deliver high level PCOR evidence-based prevention decrease cardiovascular risk . PCOR intervention emphasize patient-centered care include self-management support , team-based care , improve information system , active quality improvement show effective . Practices often require assistance integrate new program clinical operation . Practice facilitation show enhance implementation new program patient chronic disease primary care . Other method practice support , include academic detailing , collaborative learning session , health information technology assistance , also show effective , combination practice facilitation . Patient involvement may also aid practice transformation . Increasingly , practice actively include patient part change process creation patient advisory council include patient practice quality improvement team . Another method patient involvement inform implementation evidence-based care Boot Camp Translation process , patient collaborate primary care clinician , staff member , community member translate best practice culturally community relevant implementation local level . However , effort considerable success , study look incremental value add patient engagement strategy standard approach practice transformation list . This project would implement Southwest Health Extension Program Enhance Research Dissemination ( SHEPERD ) cooperative program build primary care practice capacity quality improvement , change management , implementation PCOR finding small medium size primary care practice Colorado New Mexico , initial focus cardiovascular care . It also would conduct cluster randomize trial external match cohort control group examine Reach , Effectiveness , Adoption , Implementation , Maintenance two approach practice transformation implement PCOR intervention reduce cardiovascular risk primary care practice , compare impact 1 ) standard practice transformation support intervention ( include practice facilitation , practice assessment feedback , HIT assistance , academic detailing , collaborative learning session ) 2 ) approach add patient engagement activity ( include patient advisory council boot camp translation ) part practice transformation support . This project provide critical information regard add value patient engagement practice transformation effort also result network practice across region increase capacity practice transformation implementation PCOR finding .</detailed_description>
