	<brief_summary>Aim : To evaluate effectiveness tissue response new nutritional supplement make Oligomeric Proanthocyanidins ( OPCs ) induce gingivitis 21 day use . Material Methods : A double-blind randomized control prospective clinical trial carry 20 patient divide experimental group treat OPCs pill control group treat placebo , fulfil selection criterion . Patients come 4 time study register Silness Loe Gingival Bleeding index , plaque index , inflammatory crevicular fluid study ( IL6 ) change brightness gingiva . No complementary hygiene method allow 21 day .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Double-Blind Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial Gingivitis Prevention With OPCs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Material Methods Study Design Population A randomized , double-blind , placebo-controlled , clinical trial 21 day duration conduct among 20 volunteer student Dentistry University Sevilla . No previous study find literature , 20 subject determine pilot study test hypothesis . The study protocol approve Ethics Committee University Sevilla . Prior participation , purpose procedure fully explain patient participant give write informed consent accordance Helsinki declaration . The study design , conduct , analyse report accord guideline Good Clinical Practice . The study approve Clinical Trials.gov Protocol Registration Results System number XXXXYY . The protocol access necessary ClinicalTrials.gov . The study carry September 2013 January 2104 . The recruitment start September Baseline date take place October 2013 . After 21 day follow-up , data treat obtain result January 2014 . At pre-screening visit Medical Dental history take screen carried base inclusion exclusion criterion . Inclusion criterion : subject older 18 year , male female , good general health , minimum 20 teeth ( teeth gross caries , crown extensively restore , orthodontic band , abutment , third molar include tooth count ) , sign inform consent study initiation . Exclusion criterion follow : Periodontal disease , define 4 mm / positive bleeding probing ; Pregnant breastfeeding ; Subjects fix removable prosthesis ; Tumor pathology oral cavity ; Use antibiotics 2 month period prior start trial ; Hypersensitivity red fruit general ; Xerostomia ; Active Smoker ; Contagious-infectious pathology ; Pathology severe systemic repercussion ; Any judgment investigator believe endangers risk subject participant ; Subjects phenylketonuria allergy aspartame ; Use oral hygiene product duration study . A single examiner determine assessment patient eligibility study enrolment patient trial . Patients eligible study individually randomly assign Oligomeric Proanthocyanidins Nutritional Supplement treatment Placebo group informatics programme LACER S.A . The study double-blind . The examiner patient know group assign . Results treat another examiner know patient belong experimental placebo group . The masking process establish number assignation patient study , treatment externally patient examiner allow know group belong . Patients take experimental placebo treatment night dinner rinse water . The pill maintain mouth complete dissolution . Drink eat allow 30 minute take treatment . The experimental treatment consist 90mg exocian cran 408 ( equivalent 36 mg OPC ) 120 mg Vitamin C , placebo group compose organoleptic substance free active ingredient . Both similar appearance . At baseline stage trial tartar removal carry patient enough medication entire study plus patient diary instruction correct fulfilment give . Inflammatory crevicular fluid ( IL6 ) brightness gingiva register . Two evaluation visit performance day 14 21 baseline oral clinical examination register Silness Löe Index , Gingival Bleeding index , Turesky plaque index , inflammatory crevicular fluid study ( IL6 ) change brightness gingiva . Silness Löe index Six teeth examine accord Ramfjord criterion ( 16-21-24-36-41-44 ) . Four surface tooth examine , make total 24 measurement take . These measurement performance periodontal probe examiner . Gingival Bleeding index A periodontal probe use make index . The value establish examination find : 0 - Absence inflammation . 1 - Mild inflammation , slight change colour gingival edema . No bleed probe . 2 - Moderate inflammation , redness , edema gingival hypertrophy . Bleeds probe ( 10 second ) . 3 - Severe inflammation , mark redness hypertrophy . There may ulceration . Tends spontaneous bleed . Turesky Plaque Index The buccal surface anterior teeth examine use mouthwash basic fuchsine develop agent plaque numerical scoring system O 5 establish . 0 : There plaque 1 : Independent streak plaque cervical margin tooth . 2 : thin continuous band plaque ( 1mm ) cervical margin . 3 : Band great one millimetre wide , cover less one third crown . 4 : The plate cover third two third crown . 5 : The plate cover two third crown . Inflammatory crevicular fluid study ( IL6 ) Crevicular fluid sample collect interdental area ( lingual , buccal , mesial , distal ) six teeth distribute four quadrant ( 16 , 21 , 24 , 36 , 41 44 ) 5 strip press paper 2cm long , especially crevicular fluid . The impregnation time patient 5 second immediately insert 0.5ml Eppendorf microtubes 50ul saline 4 ° C preservation . The sample transport biological laboratory refrigerator , store frozen -80°C laboratory process . Then investigator sproceeded analyse concentration ( pg/ml ) interleukins 6 present sample use panel 96 well bioplex brand Luminex® . Brightness Gingiva The brightness gingiva take identify possible change gingival colour . The redden gingiva accompanies inflammation tissue , factor may help differentiate inflammatory change level . The luminosity gingiva register Micro SpectroShadeTM MHT Optic Research AG . This instrument design take dental colour . However , besides include colour guide , SpectroShadeTM ability measure brightness colour , shade white . The change colour gingiva observe within patient measure reference colour patient point evaluation visit able compare change coloration point . Statistical Data Treatment The management data perform use SPSS statistical program . A similar database Notebook Data Collection create . For variable minimum maximum range name variable value define . The data present mean ± standard deviation measurement , p-value le 0.05 consider statistically significant . Chi-square test perform qualitative variable , T-student quantitative variable , Kolmogorov Smirnov assure normality . This study approve The Ethical Committee , examination treatment perform consent subject accord guideline Declaration Helsinki .</detailed_description>
