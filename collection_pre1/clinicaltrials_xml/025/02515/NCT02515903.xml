	<brief_summary>Views surgery method selection intracerebral hemorrhage still controversial . Since application neuroendoscopic technique intraventricular hemorrhage confirm effective safe , investigator attempt use endoscopic strategy evacuate intracerebral hematoma . Some significant advance also report endoscopic hematoma evacuation compare conventional craniotomy . However , still crucial implement prospective control study evaluate efficiency safety endoscopic technique treatment intracerebral hemorrhage . In study , investigator exclusively select patient intracerebral hemorrhage basal ganglia region . This study compare efficacy safety endoscopic surgery versus stereotactic aspiration neurologic outcomes patient intracerebral hemorrhage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Between Stereotactic Aspiration Intra-endoscopic Surgery Treat Intracerebral Hemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although incidence mortality spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH ) decrease improved management high blood pressure , ICH may induce serious disability patient continue major socioeconomic problem . The evacuation ICH use open craniotomy computer tomography ( CT ) -guided stereotaxy may improve survival rate patient fail prove efficacy improve patient ' functional outcome despite numerous effort . Endoscopy-guided evacuation ICH provide less invasive quicker surgical decompression , may potentially improve functional outcome patient . In previous study , endoscope-guided evacuation ICH often refer endoscope provide illuminate system operate channel independent endoscope ( endoscopy-controlled microneurosurgery endoscopy-assisted microneurosurgery ) . In recent year , author commit explore procedure intra-endoscopy-guided evacuation ICH , mean illuminating channel , irrigation-aspiration channel work channel locate endoscope . This kind procedure call real endoscopic neurosurgery ( EN ) , may potentially decrease operative concomitant injury extent . However , inherent drawback intra-endoscopic procedure , include limited visualization surgical field difficult maintenance patency aspiration wand , offset advantage instance . The author exclusively invent special endoscopic transparent sheath guide hematoma puncture agitation-aspiration system ( AAS ) keep patency aspiration wand . Detailed procedure application implement verified series patient intracerebral hemorrhage . Meanwhile , mortality rate , complication outcome parameter procedure CT-guided procedure compare .</detailed_description>
