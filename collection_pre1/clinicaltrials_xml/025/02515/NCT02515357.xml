	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnoea ( OSA ) chronic disease characterize recurrent complete partial interruption breathe sleep due obstruction upper airway , lead disturbance gas exchange , hypoxia consequent arousal . Beyond adverse impact sleep duration , sleep quality , well functionality cognitive function day ( typical symptom include fatigue , sleepiness , decrease reflex , impaired memory , etc. ) . OSA currently recognize major cause morbidity mortality due strong association obesity cardiometabolic disease , include metabolic syndrome ( individual component , namely abdominal adiposity , impair fast glucose , dyslipidaemia hypertension ) , cardiovascular disease diabetes mellitus . According epidemiological data , prevalence range 2 % 7 % general population ( clear lead obese middle-aged men ) , however estimate large proportion patient ( 70-80 % ) remain undiagnosed make disease major public health challenge 21st century . Currently , first line treatment management moderate-to-severe OSA mild OSA accompany symptom ( daytime sleepiness cognitive disorder ) disease ( hypertension heart disease ) application continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) sleep , usually via renal mask . CPAP proven effective alleviate symptom disease ( e.g . pause breathe sleep daytime sleepiness ) , however also characterize high rate non-compliance effectiveness improve cardiometabolic index yet confirm . Given strong relationship OSA obesity concomitant metabolic disorder , well aforementioned restriction use CPAP sole treatment disease , lifestyle change currently emerge promising treatment OSA . Indeed , several interventional study investigate effect lifestyle change treatment OSA , focus primarily weight loss - achieve hypocaloric diet , either solely combination exercise lifestyle counsel - available data support effectiveness reduce severity disease improve associate cardiometabolic disorder overweight patient . However , study explore potential effect diet 's quality lifestyle habit ( physical activity ) OSA severity associate disorder , besides weight loss , currently lack . Given Mediterranean dietary pattern well lifestyle habit adopt population Mediterranean region ( e.g . consumption seasonal , traditional eco-friendly food product , regular physical activity , adequate rest day , etc . ) proven beneficial prevention resolution metabolic syndrome associate cardiometabolic disease , aim present study implement intervention base Mediterranean lifestyle evaluate potential beneficial effect biochemical clinical characteristic sample patient OSA , compare standard care . This study randomize , control , single-blind clinical trial . The study sample consist adult ( 18-65 year old ) , overweight obese ( Body Mass Index &gt; 25 kg/m2 ) patient moderate severe OSA ( Apnea Hypopnea Index &gt; 15 ) confirm polysomnography Center Sleep Disorders 1st Department Critical Care Pulmonary Services `` Evaggelismos '' General Hospital Athens . At baseline , patient inform detail study give write consent . Then , subject randomly assign one 2 group : ( ) control group , receive hypocaloric diet ( 1500 kcal/d woman 1800 kcal/d men ) write general advice healthy lifestyle ( b ) Mediterranean lifestyle group , receive hypocaloric diet ( 1500 kcal/d woman 1800 kcal/d men ) attend comprehensive lifestyle intervention , comprise 7 60-min group counsel session , conduct every two week first 2 month every month follow 4 month end 6-month intervention . In Mediterranean lifestyle group , food group Mediterranean diet target accord pattern propose Mediterranean diet pyramid ( e.g . increase consumption fruit , vegetable whole grain , decrease consumption red meat sweet , preference olive oil main source dietary fat ) , beneficial culinary practice , seasonality locality food product consume , adequate rest day , well adoption physically active lifestyle additionally address . Lifestyle counsel base goal set theory , motivational behavioural strategy also use . The lifestyle intervention also aim achieve 5-10 % weight loss within first 6 month . The dietary intervention monitoring carry laboratory Clinical Nutrition &amp; Dietetics Harokopio University , experience clinical dietitian conduct consultation . The assessment patient ' clinical , laboratory lifestyle characteristic perform baseline , end 6-month intervention 1 year study entry Center Sleep Disorders 1st Department Critical Care Pulmonary Services `` Evaggelismos '' General Hospital Athens . The evaluation include : 1 ) brief medical history assessment , 2 ) assessment severity disease polysomnography , 3 ) evaluation insomnia Athens Insomnia Scale , 4 ) assessment daytime sleepiness Epworth Sleepiness Scale , 5 ) evaluation quality life SF-36 questionnaire , 6 ) dietary assessment semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire ( data food frequency questionnaire use evaluate participant ' food group individual food beverage consumption , well adherence Mediterranean diet Mediterranean Diet Score ) 24-hour dietary recall ( data 24-h dietary recall analyse term energy , macro- micronutrient intake use Nutritionist Pro , version 2.2 software , well meal frequency pattern ) , 7 ) physical activity assessment International Physical Activity Questionnaire , 8 ) anthropometric measurement ( height , weight , waist hip circumference ) , 9 ) blood pressure measurement 10 ) fast blood sample urine sample collection laboratory measurement ( lipid profile , marker glucose metabolism , marker liver function , inflammatory marker , marker oxidative stress , etc . ) use automate analyser and/or commercial ELISA kit .</detailed_description>
