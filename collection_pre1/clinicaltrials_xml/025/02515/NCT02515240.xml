	<brief_title>Immune Response Pneumococcal Vaccination HIV Infected Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All potential study candidate ask fill questionnaire concern medical history medication . This survey determine eligibility . If eligible , part experimental protocol HIV positive participant agree randomize immediate vs. delay pneumococcal immunization 3 blood draw around time immunization . The HIV negative control population agree immunization pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine ( PPV ) , standard care population , 3 blood draw around time immunization . The investigator study effect pneumococcal vaccination HIV positive adult . At present time recommend HIV positive individual receive pneumococcal vaccine time diagnosis cluster differentiation ( CD4 ) count &lt; 200 vaccinate either immediately alternatively , treat highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) 6 month follow PPV . All patient recommend re-vaccinated 5 year . This standard care . It however unclear HIV positive patient respond PPV . In 1st part study , Part I , newly diagnose HIV positive individual recruit . As standard care , individual receive pneumococcal vaccine regardless participation study . Those agree participate study group accord CD4 count : &gt; 500 , 200-500 &lt; 200 . Those CD4 count &lt; 200 randomly assign receive vaccine immediately receive HAART 6 month prior vaccination , accordance present recommendation , either immediate vaccination give HAART 6 month prior vaccination consider acceptable.. Thus ALL HIV positive individual receive vaccine presently recommend . The HIV positive volunteer agree ( experimental part protocol ) : 1 . Be randomize either immediate vaccination vs. 6 month start HAART CD4 count &lt; 200 2 . Donate blood specimens 3 different time : day 0 , day vaccination : 2 mL , day 7 , 40 mL day 28-42 one time sample 2 mL . 3 . Have blood sample subject antibody analysis ( concentration functional activity ) antibody gene usage analysis There 4 HIV positive group part study : CD4 &gt; 500 , CD4 200-500 , CD4 &lt; 200 immediate vaccination CD4 &lt; 200 , delay vaccination . There 19 individual per group . The HIV negative control Part I study ( n=19 ) agree participate also vaccinate pneumococcal vaccine . This NOT vaccine recommend healthy adult NOT contra-indicated . Thus part experimental procedure individual : 1 . Receive FDA approve pneumococcal vaccine 2 . Blood sample obtain day 0 : 2 mL , day 7 40 mL day 28-42 , one time sample 2 mL . 3 . Blood sample analyze antibody concentration , functional activity gene family usage . In summary , study total 5 group Part I : Group 1 : HIV positive CD4 &gt; 500 Group 2 : HIV positive CD4 200-500 Group 3 : HIV positive CD4 &lt; 200 immediate vaccination Group 4 : HIV positive CD4 &lt; 200 delayed ( 6 month ) vaccination Group 5 : HIV negative In part II study investigator evaluate effect second pneumococcal vaccination , presently recommend , HIV positive individual , receive 5 year first vaccination . Again , HIV positive individual due second pneumovax ask participate . They group accord CD4 count CD4 &gt; 500 CD4 200-500 . Thus ALL HIV positive individual receive vaccine recommend . The HIV positive volunteer solely agree ; 1 . Donate blood specimens 3 different occasion : day 0 , day vaccination : 2 mL , day 7 , 40 mL day 28-42 one time sample 2 mL . 2 . Have blood sample subject antibody analysis ( concentration functional activity ) antibody gene usage analysis There 2 HIV positive group : CD4 &gt; 500 CD4 count 200-500 . There 19 individual per group . The HIV negative control Part II study agree participate recruit population individual previously vaccinate pneumovax . They also vaccinate second time pneumococcal vaccine , 5 year first vaccination . This NOT vaccine recommend healthy adult NOT contra-indicated . Thus part experimental procedure individual : 1 . Receive FDA approve pneumococcal vaccine 2 . Blood sample obtain day 0 : 2 mL , day 7 40 mL day 28-42 one time sample 2 mL . 3 . Blood sample analyze antibody concentration , functional activity gene family usage . In summary , study 3 group Part II study Group 6 : HIV positive CD4 &gt; 500 , 2nd PPV Group 7 : HIV positive CD4 200-500 , 2nd PPV Group 8 : HIV negative , 2nd PPV .</detailed_description>
