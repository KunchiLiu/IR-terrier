	<brief_summary>Protection Oddi 's sphincter remain huge argument especially long term complication like common bile duct stone recurrence cholangitis ERCP , determine destroy sphincter Oddi . The purpose study compare long-term outcome ERCP sequential LC versus LCBDE choledocholithiasis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison LCBDE v ERCP + LC Choledocholithiasis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cholelithiasis , common etiology factor responsible abdominal pain , highly prevalent worldwide . According data general investigation , morbidity cholelithiasis differs 2.36 % 42 % different area , 5 % 29 % ( average 18 % ) cholelithiasis case gallbladder stone common bile duct stone . In population age 70 year old , 30 % suffers gallbladder stone China . A causal link development gallbladder stone common bile duct stone 10 % 15 % gallstone patient high potential develop secondary common bile duct stone . In 1987 , laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( LC ) come revolutionary surgical method . With minimally invasive effect high safety , LC soon accept 'Golden standard ' treatment gallbladder stone . Endoscopic sphincterotomy ( EST ) firstly report Kawai Classen 1970 . As , combination EST endoscopic technique , basket extraction , balloon dilation lithotripsy , significantly improve stone removal rate 85 % 90 % , ERCP consider optimal method regard CBD stone treatment . In 1991 , laparoscopic common bile duct exploration ( LCBDE ) reflect advantage rigid scope rise promise minimally invasive alternative treatment common bile duct ( CBD ) stone . Currently , mainly two kind minimally invasive treatment choledocholithiasis , refers `` one-stage '' laparoscopic method , LCBDE `` sequential two-stage '' method , ERCP follow LC . Both method able achieve therapeutic purpose . However , always controversy advantage disadvantage due lack evidence long-term follow-up , especially difference long-term complication relate Oddi 's sphincter functional status , importantly refer stone recurrence rate cholangitis . The potential long-term complication result EST remain issue . It believe EST handle Oddi 's sphincter stenosis , regurgitation cholangitis , high cholangiocarcinoma risk long run . By virtue ERCP , multiple high stone clearance rate ( 87 % ~97 % ) report , meanwhile high re-ERCP rate ( around 25 % ) also indicate stone residual , whether great stone residual rate link future stone recurrence repeat cholangitis clear . Several randomize control trial ( RCT ) study compare ERCP plus LC LCBDE , result similar aspect stone removal rate , cost , patient acceptance . However , postoperative cholangitis rate one single center study quite different another . Moreover , study relate stone recurrence rate long term follow-up . Obviously , previous RCT study limit comparison ERCP follow LC versus LCBDE long-term complication , especially stone recurrence cholangitis . Therefore , multicenter randomize control study design prospectively compare stone recurrence cholangitis rate ERCP plus LC LCBDE reflect valuable Oddi 's sphincter protection disease management , dedicate treatment gallbladder common duct stone .</detailed_description>
