	<brief_summary>The development anti-angiogenesis drug lead renew enthusiasm lung cancer treatment . Apatinib , also know YN968D1 , tyrosine kinase inhibitor selectively inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 ( VEGFR-2 ) also represent mild inhibition PDGFR , c-Kit c-src tyrosine kinase . It orally bioavailable , small molecule agent think inhibit VEGF-mediated endothelial cell migration proliferation thus block blood vessel formation tumor tissue . Previous study identify apatinib well tolerated dos 750mg daily . In phase I/II study , investigator report objective response rate 80 % 65 cancer patient . In phase III trial conduct advanced pretreated gastric cancer , median overall survival significantly prolong apatinib group compare placebo group . Thus , trial , investigator aim investigate efficacy safety apatinib heavily pretreated advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
