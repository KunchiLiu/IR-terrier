	<brief_summary>The investigator aim investigate whether low energy shockwave therapy ( LE-SWT ) preserve kidney function diabetic patient . Participants study receive LE-SWT treatment 6 time 3 week . The treatment non-invasive known side effect . Previous study show LE-SWT induces angiogenesis . The investigator hypothesize chromium-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) renal clearance remain stable increase treat patient . Furthermore , kidney biopsy show sign damage tissue possibly neo-vascularization . In project , investigator shall also investigate LE-SWT effect urinary marker tubular damage urinary nitric oxide index . Patients ' self-reported quality life assess use Short Form 36 version 2 ( SF-36v2 ) Health Survey . There 18-months follow-up patient . Only patient 18-65 year old moderate chronic kidney failure diabetes include . This project interventional prospective study . 30 patient moderate kidney failure recruit Department Endocrinology , Odense University Hospital , Denmark . LE-SWT treatment perform ambulatory Department Urology . Patients hospitalize 1 day Department Nephrology kidney biopsy take ( two time study period ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1.0 Background 1.1 Definitions chronic kidney disease The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative ( K/DOQI ) National Kidney Foundation ( NKF ) define chronic kidney disease either kidney damage decrease glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) less 60 mL/min/1.73m2 3 month . Whatever underlying etiology , destruction renal mass irreversible sclerosis loss nephron lead progressive decline GFR . The different stage chronic kidney disease form continuum time . In 2002 , K/DOQI publish classification stage chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , follow : Stage 1 : Kidney damage normal increase GFR ( &gt; 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) Stage 2 : Mild reduction GFR ( 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) Stage 3 : Moderate reduction GFR ( 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) Stage 4 : Severe reduction GFR ( 15-29 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) Stage 5 : Kidney failure ( GFR &lt; 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 ) 1.2 Epidemiology There rise incidence prevalence kidney failure poor outcomes high cost . The Third National Health Examination Survey ( NHANES III ) estimate prevalence chronic kidney disease adult United States 11 % ( 19.2 million ) . The prevalence chronic kidney disease stag 1-4 increase 10 % 1988-1994 13.1 % 1999-2004 . This increase partially explain increase prevalence diabetes hypertension , two common cause chronic kidney disease . Data United States Renal Data System ( USRDS ) show prevalence chronic renal failure increase 104 % year 1990-2001 incidence rate rise 30 % 1992 2008 . Diabetic nephropathy one devastate complication diabetes . It remain lead cause end stage renal disease ( ESRD ) , account 44 % ESRD incident case United States . 1.3 Etiology The single important factor responsible increase incidence CKD diabetes mellitus . Renal affection include albuminuria , hypertension decline kidney function . Blood pressure control , difficult achieve diabetic , mandatory long term prognosis . 1.4 Prognosis Many patient chronic kidney disease might progress ESRD . The rate progression depend underlying diagnosis , successful implementation secondary preventive measure individual patient . At every age , patient ESRD dialysis significantly increase morbidity mortality compare non-dialysis patient individual without kidney disease . 1.5 Treatment The medical care patient chronic kidney disease usually focus follow : - Delaying halt progression chronic kidney disease - Treating pathologic manifestation chronic kidney disease However , treatment available reverse effect CKD . 2.0 Aim The aim study demonstrate Low Energy Shockwave Treatment improve stabilizes renal function diabetic patient - thereby potentially reduce patient ' morbidity mortality . 3.0 Hypothesis The investigator hypothesize Low Energy Shockwave Therapy ( LE-SWT ) perform diabetic patient ' kidney MODULITH SLX-F2 lithotripter : 1 . Increases glomerular function measure chromium-EDTA clearance 3 , 6 , 18 month post treatment . 2 . Stimulates Nitric Oxide ( NO ) release measure increased level NO metabolite , nitrate nitrite , cyclic Guanosine Monophosphate ( cGMP ) patient ' spot urine . 3 . Does cause increase urinary level marker tubular glomerular damage , i.e . Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin ( NGAL ) albumin . 4 . Induces angiogenesis prevents fibrosis kidney tissue show kidney biopsy histology . Furthermore , LE-SWT protects destruction glomerular basal lamina reveal electron microscopy . 5 . Improves self-reported quality life measure use Short Form 36 version 2 ( SF-36v2 ) health survey . 6 . Causes clinical side effect The investigator test hypothesis interventional study 30 diabetic patient moderate chronic kidney failure treat 6 session LE-SWT kidney 3 week . 4.0 LE-SWT treatment Lithotripter : Treatment carry use MODULITH SLX-F2 B+W Colour Doppler Ultrasound System . The patient lie supine position treatment , need analgesia energy level treatment low . Kidney localise line ultrasound ( x-ray exposure ) . 3000 shock frequency 4 Hz apply kidney , per session . The kidney divide three treatment area include 1000 shock wave apply treatment area . Patients receive 2 session per week 3 week . Shock wave therapy take approximately 15 minute kidney . Total treatment time per session approximately 40 minute ( include 10 minute preparation ultrasound localisation ) . 5.0 Ethical consideration The investigator expect significant ethical problem study . Treatment extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy ( ESWL ) kidney stone , use 10 time energy , use 25 year worldwide . No kidney damage report treatment except hematoma patient give anticoagulant treatment . Participants closely monitor clinically include blood urine test . Blood pressure measure treatment specified time schedule . Studies plan , include chromium-EDTA clearance measurement , renography , kidney biopsy . The renal biopsy do Department Nephrology , Odense University Hospital , perform department 's approved instruction , besides risk bleeding , associate great risk . Chromium-EDTA clearance associate minor radiation dose . The injected tracer contain small amount radioactivity , result radiation dose equivalent absorption standard X-ray lung . According Health Board regulation directive , correspond 0.1 mSv , equal 1/10 background radiation . The background radiation radiation dose man receive annually environment ( example space , earth , air , drink water food ) . Renography also associate minor radiation dose . Radioactive dose 0.7 millisievert ( mSv ) . Load decrease radioactive agent excrete urine . Patients immediate benefit participation apart possible improvement renal function . Patients inform orally write . 6.0 Informed consent patient right Before inclusion project , patient provide write consent participate clinical project he/she inform orally write comprehensive way experimental important detail , risk drawback . The patient also give patient information copy sign consent form individual schedule project . Potential participant recommend third party present information process . They advise entitle consideration final decision take consent time withdrawn . The patient must consent writing . The give write oral information patient 's consent confirm principal investigator Sune Møller Jeppesen patient single-handed dated signature . Investigator shall undertake study specifically required clinical project obtain valid informed consent . The patient ' name keep secret . Patients identified assessment documentation patient number allocate start . Patients informed confidentiality patient right participation information . The sign informed consent form remain investigator . The investigator require form inspect request . The investigator keep list contain patient ' number name record - desire - could provide later date . Both consent form list patient number must keep 10 year . 7.0 Perspectives study The perspective study show LE-SWT harmless treatment CKD improve degree nephropathy . LE-SWT non-invasive non-painful treatment procedure easy perform . Currently , treatment available reverse effect diabetic CKD long-term medical intervention may halt progression disease . Considering morbidity mortality affect diabetic patient health care cost CKD , demand explore new therapy CKD . Given simplicity LE-SWT , investigator believe potential treatment could cost effective even modest result although analysis beyond scope study . 8.0 Publication policy Results project intend publish international national medical journal . Principal investigator Sune Møller Jeppesen first author Professor Lars Lund last author article . Other participant rank accord international guideline .</detailed_description>
