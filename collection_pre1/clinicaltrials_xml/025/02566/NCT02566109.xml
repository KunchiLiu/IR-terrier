	<brief_summary>The overall proposal test community hospital utility 10-min magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan protocol combine proprietary image analysis algorithm detect early cardiovascular ( CV ) injury receipt chemotherapy breast cancer ( BrC ) lymphoma . This technology provide health-care delivery system time-efficient method identify risk future CV event prevention implement prolong survival reduce morbidity cancer survivor .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>While recent research indicate conventional MRI , advance echocardiography ( global longitudinal strain 3D ) serum biomarkers detect CV injury early receipt Chemotherapy , method require lengthy difficult examination routinely execute community hospital majority patient BrC &amp; lymphoma treat . Yet , 1-month deterioration traditional 45-min MRI measure know forecast 6-month subclinical deterioration leave ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) associate CV event . At time , new observational data indicate therapy HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors/statins administer early receipt Chemotherapy may prevent subsequent cardiac dysfunction CV event . Our MRI fast scan technique remedy community hospital implementation obstacle . In proposal , investigator propose test utility fast scan within exist funded randomized clinical trial R01HL118740 generic atorvastatin research method prevent cardiotoxicity patient treat Chemotherapy BrC lymphoma ( take advantage significant exist clinical trial resource ) . This study allow u address over-arching goal : determine optimal implementation ( alone combination test ) proprietary MRI process forecast CV injury patient treat Chemotherapy community hospital performance Phase II comparative effectiveness study within ongoing clinical trial .</detailed_description>

Most breast tissue expanders allow . ( If uncertain , inform MRI tech confirm eligibility status . ) Unable provide inform consent Symptomatic Claustrophobia Pregnant breast feeding . Due unknown risk potential harm unborn fetus negative serum pregnancy test within 10 day prior registration require patient childbearing potential . For reason patient childbearing potential must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ( sex ) , oral contraceptive , intrauterine device ( IUD ) , DeProvera , tubal ligation , vasectomy partner ( confirm negative sperm count ) monogamous relationship ( partner ) . An acceptable , although less reliable method involve careful use condom spermicidal foam gel and/or cervical cap sponge prior study entry duration study participation .
