	<brief_title>A Randomized Comparison Transcervical Foley Bulb With Vaginal Misoprostol Vaginal Misoprostol Alone Induction Labor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Objectives The hypothesis cervical ripen use foley bulb together vaginal misoprostol ( cytotec ) result short induction delivery time compare vaginal misoprostol alone 2 . Background The rate induction labor United States approximately 20 % birth . Induction labor result prolong labor increase rate cesarean delivery , associate increase maternal neonatal morbidity . Ripening unfavorable cervix become integral part labor induction process . The best method cervical ripening remain controversial ; one method prove superior . Women require labor induction often present unfavorable cervix lead prolonged induction . Cervical ripen often do increase likelihood successful labor induction . Misoprostol ( cytotec ) PGE1 analog widely use cervical ripening preferred method induction labor base safety report literature . Low-dose ( 25 mcg ) intravaginal misoprostol appear safe effective cervical ripen term pregnancy patient without history cesarean section . Compared cervical ripening method , misoprostol increase rate vaginal delivery within 24 hour without significant difference cesarean section rate fetal outcomes . The use foley catheter induction labor first describe Krause 1953 . In 1967 Embrey Mollison report 94 % successful induction rate use foley catheter cervical ripening . Since , several study find transcervical foley catheter effective prostaglandin preparation ripen without increase risk uterine rupture . There many propose method induction labor include mechanical ( transcervical foley bulb ) chemical method ( prostaglandin , oxytocin ) . A number randomize trial compare use foley bulb , oxytocin misoprostol different combination induction labor result contradictory regard induction delivery time , successful vaginal delivery labor complication . There two study evaluate foley bulb misoprostol compare misoprostol alone . Carbone el al study , find mean induction delivery time 3 hour short combination foley bulb vaginal misoprostol compare vaginal misoprostol alone . In study Chung et al , difference induction delivery time . Therefore give contradict result regard induction labor use foley bulb misoprostol misoprostol alone , purpose study determine decrease induction delivery time one method versus . 3 . Setting Human Research Research take place labor delivery floor Roosevelt Hospital 4 . Study Design ) Recruitment Methods Women admit labor delivery Roosevelt Hospital ask participate study induction labor beyond term ( 37weeks gestation ) . Patients screen meet eligibility criterion approach . Informed consent obtain . After discussion study eligible interested subject , investigator review consent . The investigator give potential subject opportunity ask question answer . Potential participant give opportunity think study . ( Only investigator list study personnel authorize obtain consent , obtain informed consent ) . Once patient wish join study inform consent obtain , subject participate . Each subject receive sign copy consent form . The subject withdraw study time without retribution .</detailed_description>
