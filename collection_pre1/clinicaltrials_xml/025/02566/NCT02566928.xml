	<brief_summary>The overall goal project develop evaluate home-based intervention prevent re-infection transmission Community-Acquired Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus ( CA-MRSA ) patient present primary care skin soft tissue infection ( SSTIs ) . Centers Disease Control ( CDC ) CA-MRSA guideline include incision drainage , antibiotic sensitivity test antibiogram-directed prescribing . Re-infections common , range 16 % 43 % , present significant challenge clinician , patient family . Several decolonization decontamination intervention show reduce Hospital-Acquired MRSA ( HA-MRSA ) re-infection transmission intensive care unit . Few study examine feasibility effectiveness infection prevention intervention primary care setting , none employ Community Health Workers ( CHWs ) `` promotoras '' provide home visit education intervention decolonization decontamination . This comparative effectiveness research/patient center outcome research build upon highly stakeholder-engaged community-academic research learn collaborative , include practice clinician , patient , clinical laboratory researcher , barbers/beauticians . Clinical Directors Network ( CDN ) , establish , NIH-recognized best practice Federally Qualified Health Center ( FQHC ) Practice-based Research Network ( PBRN ) , The Rockefeller University propose address question completion four aim : ( 1 ) To evaluate comparative effectiveness CHW/Promotora-delivered home intervention ( Experimental Group ) compare Usual Care ( Control Group ) primary patient-centered clinical outcome ( SSTI recurrence rate ) secondary patient-centered clinical outcome ( pain , depression , quality life , care satisfaction ) use two-arm randomize control trial ( RCT ) . ( 2 ) To understand patient-level factor ( CA-MRSA infection prevention knowledge , self-efficacy , decision-making autonomy , prevention behaviors/adherence ) environmental-level factor ( household surface contamination , household member colonization , transmission household member ) associate difference SSTI recurrence rate . ( 3 ) To understand interaction intervention bacterial genotypic phenotypic variable decontamination , decolonization , SSTI recurrence , household transmission . ( 4 ) To explore evolution stakeholder engagement interaction among patient community stakeholder practice community-based clinician academic laboratory clinical investigator duration study period .</brief_summary>
