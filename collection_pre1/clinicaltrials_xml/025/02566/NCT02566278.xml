	<brief_summary>The investigator hypothesis upper airway collapsibility ( Pcrit ) patient obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) measure use equipment find clinical sleep laboratory Pcrit measurement obtain use clinical sleep laboratory equipment comparable obtain use research equipment . OSA common disease characterize repetitive collapse upper airway sleep , lead hypoxemia arousal , important neurocognitive cardiovascular consequence . The single important factor development OSA upper airway collapsibility : collapsible upper airway tend OSA stiffer upper airway . The gold standard treatment OSA continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) , act stenting open collapsible airway . Upper airway collapsibility measure sleep change CPAP level assess change inspiratory flow upper airway . Although technically feasible , measurement typically undertaken research laboratory specialize equipment . The purpose study measure upper airway collapsibility use clinically available ( i.e . equipment find clinical sleep laboratory ) equipment . If successful , upper airway collapsibility could routinely measure clinical practice , could help inform treatment decision help individualize therapy OSA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>OSA define total partial intermittent collapse upper airway , result nocturnal hypoxemia arousal sleep . OSA incredible common important cardiovascular ( e.g . hypertension , coronary artery disease , stroke , atrial fibrillation ) neurocognitive consequence ( e.g . depression , motor vehicle accident ) . Thus , OSA result significant morbidity mortality substantial economic burden . The best studied treatment OSA continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) , effectively stents upper airway open , however , many patient able tolerate . Other treatment available , oral appliance upper airway surgery , however much variable effectiveness . Although factor important , important factor OSA pathogenesis upper airway collapsibility . The upper airway collapsibility determine sleep patient OSA CPAP . The CPAP level decrease flow limitation finally collapse achieve . The pressure airway collapse call pharyngeal critical closing pressure , Pcrit . When measure research laboratory , Pcrit correlate OSA severity . Subjects high Pcrit ( e.g . 5cm water pressure ) typically severe OSA , low Pcrit ( e.g . 2cm water pressure ) mild OSA , negative Pcrit ( e.g . -4cm water , airway must suck closed collapse ) typically disease . The Pcrit may also important implication treatment . For example , patient OSA high Pcrit may require CPAP , however , low slightly negative Pcrit might successfully treat oral appliance . Thus , knowledge Pcrit might useful clinical practice , rarely measure outside research lab . To measure Pcrit , patient sleep mask nose nose mouth , CPAP apply use custom make machine rapidly change mask pressure . The idea rapid change airway pressure produce clear step change airflow observed quickly . In contrast , clinical titration , CPAP machine change pressure much slowly help promote patient comfort . The goal research determine whether slow pressure change could still use gather useful information upper airway collapsibility .</detailed_description>
