	<brief_summary>This research study do learn severe asthma compare people severe asthma milder form asthma people without asthma , baseline time . Individuals ask join research study help understand difference lung blood participant severe asthma compare milder asthma healthy individual , well differences overall health . Investigators also want determine whether difference predict asthma-related biologic outcome 1 year follow .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Immune Interactions Severe Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study obtain human lung sample bronchoscopy range asthmatic healthy control address question related mechanisms development complex immune process observed lung . Samples evaluate Type-1 , Type-2 Interleukin-27 ( IL-27 ) expression ( downstream signature ) . In addition , sample evaluate presence absence Interleukin-10 ( IL-10 ) counter regulatory pathway . These pathway directly evaluate epithelial brushing bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) cell , well BAL fluid . Broad gene expression profile ( Ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) -sequencing ) also perform determine range immune-inflammatory marker present severe asthmatic . Investigators specifically address Signal Transducers Activators Transcription ( STAT ) signal pathway , particularly STAT-1 STAT-3 determine pattern activation downstream response develop new therapy . Additionally , subset , investigator compare target untargeted gene expression obtain bronchoscopic sample expression obtain clinically perform video assist thoracoscopic ( VATS ) biopsy severe systemic corticosteroid dependent patient . The ultimate goal study determine whether predictive biomarker panel identify less invasive bronchoscopic sample predict finding see VATS biopsy .</detailed_description>
