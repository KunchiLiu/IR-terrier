	<brief_summary>The purpose study learn maintain health independence senior develop tool collect data constantly home . Caregivers use information make decision health care , individual may able live independently longer . Specific Aims study : - Aim 1 : To identify trend data predict health decline . To serve aim , want test number tool develop , in-home sensor , determine one best measure health risk senior . After collect information one year , look tool could useful provide feedback senior community process age . - Aim 2 : To develop system analyze data collect present summary data care team . - Aim 3 : To validate data computer-based tool senior community setting .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The propose study potential transform current research clinical practice paradigm prediction decision make independent living . This accomplish shift reliance episodic , self-reported crisis event provoke data use ecologically valid multidimensional continuous physiological , activity , behavioral data . This approach great potential substantially improve care need transition decision . In achieve goal several innovation beyond available system ongoing research notable . First , ground prior study associate static clinical measure future placement outcome , contemporaneously continuously acquire fundamental physiological measure ( weight walk speed ) , activity behavioral measure , thereby improve ability proactively discriminate important health functional change real time . Using exist in-home activity data collect longitudinally age population combine simulate data additional new sense measure ( phone use , medication taking , body composition ) generate derive novel metric - AIMs - provide objective dynamic measure activity behavior essential maintain independence . These metric use develop prediction algorithm base documented transition outcomes original data set use care team ( Aim 1 ) . Working care transition professional iteratively query refinement objective measure ( Aim 2 ) . These care provider ' expertise understanding key change impact independence invaluable identification ambient independence measure matter , lead meaningful care implementation pathway . The efficacy final set measure choose build user friendly interface care team use ( Aim 2 ) test ( Aim 3 ) compare independently live senior one three comparison group : 1 ) instal technology , AIMs data extract provide care transition team aid transition decision ; 2 ) instal technology , AIMs data extract available transition team ; 3 ) technology . We may insufficient power recognize significant change validation group control group . However , primarily study intend test feasibility approach , identify type AIMs data useful make transition decision , use inform large , definitive study future .</detailed_description>
