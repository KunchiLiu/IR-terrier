	<brief_summary>This pilot study . The objective understand mechanism amantadine improve function patient persistent vegetative state minimally conscious state . Specifically , investigator measure size nerve fiber mediate arousal ( reticular activating system , RAS ) pre post treatment MRI tractography . MRI finding correlate Disability Rating Scale ( DRS ) score . The information gather study use formulate large clinical trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Amantadine Functional Improvement Following ABI Measured MRI Tractography ; A Pilot Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Aim : To determine size RAS tracts measure MRI tractography . Specifically , investigator measure fiber tract project posterior thalamus . The RAS involve mediate arousal consciousness . The size fiber tract measure prior initiate treatment near time discharge rehabilitation hospital approximately ninety-days . It hypothesize treatment result increase size fiber tract . As pilot study , investigator determine feasibility recruit retain patient type study . This allow clarification understand technical standard MRI tractography related assessment reticular activate system . Secondary Aim : To determine monitor change function follow acquire brain injury measure Disability Rating Scale ( DRS ) score . The DRS score obtain prior initiate treatment termination study . It hypothesize treatment amantadine addition standard medical treatment , associate improvement function .</detailed_description>
