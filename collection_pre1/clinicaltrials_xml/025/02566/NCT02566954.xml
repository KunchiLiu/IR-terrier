	<detailed_description>The study 3 part : First one address key question lower limb frontal alignment base three-dimensional measurement low-dose bi-planar X-rays foot morphology assessment . Indeed , major issue management low limb disorder ability correctly assess abnormal development decide adapt treatment option . In particular , link low limb disorder foot morphology remain unclear . Recently , quantitative 3D measurement low limb child successfully assess use low-dose biplanar X-rays . The population study 133 patient , age 6 16 year old , low limb stand X-ray require medical reason interfere torsional longitudinal axis limb ( , example , patient consult non-specific low limb pain ) . All patient low-dose biplanar X-rays use EOS® system ( EOS® Imaging , France ) . From EOS® bi-planar image , 3D patient-specific parametric model lower limb obtain . The clinical index ( i.e . mechanical femoral ( MFA ) mechanical tibial ( MTA ) angle , Hip Knee Shaft angle ( HKS ) femoro tibial angle ( FTA ) ) automatically compute . For clinical parameter , mean value standard deviation calculate , depend age group , gender , foot morphology Second part ass reproducibility 3dimensional reconstruction whether make radiology technician , so-called expert collect data 3 center pediatric surgery EOS Imaging system daily use get spine low limb X-Rays . The investigator include 20 child , divide follow : six typically develop one ( control X-Rays low limb stand X-ray require medical reason interfere torsional longitudinal axis limb ) , 6 non-typically develop ( example child undergo low limb fracture ) , 6 cerebral palsy one , 2 child extreme low limb deformity . Reconstructions do twice center : qualified operator , senior orthopedic surgeon , follow practical course , radiology technician , also use software . First step calculate reproducibility parameter , depend subgroup patient . Then , parameter , outlier ' value analyze explain . They suppress data re-calculate reproducibility . Finally , reproducibility obtain parameter compare one publish literature Last part work recently develop weight-bearing foot 3D reconstruction method clinical use use Parametric Personalized Modelling approach ( PPM ) . This allow well understanding evaluation foot 's anatomy patho-anatomy .</detailed_description>
