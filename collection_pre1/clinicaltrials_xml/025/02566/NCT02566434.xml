	<brief_summary>Participants receive four different dos methionine four month long intervention two week wash-out period intervention . The dose increase intervention . Two visit intervention also involve receive stable isotope infusion determine metabolism methionine body . Participants also monitor via blood work questionnaires regard overall health .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study subject : Healthy volunteer ( 40 - 79 year ) include study . Informed consent obtain study related procedure perform . All subject extensively screen research nurse / physician . Exclusion criterion condition interfere definition 'healthy '' accord study physician 's judgement base medical history , lab testing , use medication , physical exam . Study design : To establish Upper Level Safe intake ( USLI ) methionine intake , essential create dose-response approach possible negative effect methionine . To define Lowest-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level ( LOAEL ) , investigator suggest 4 week intervention 2 4 week washout healthy volunteer free methionine 10 mg/kg body weight/day ( =requirement ) , 25 mg/kg body weight/day , 50 mg/kg body weight/day 100 mg/kg body weight/day . Pure methionine provide ICAAS . The 4-week intervention period base study pig ( 6 ) . Methionine consume 3 daily dos . Participants advise daily dietary intake study . Besides screen visit , subject come back 13 study visit ( 5 Short study Days ( SD , approx . 30 min ) 8 Long study Days ( LD , approx . 5 h ) . On study day ( SD LD ) investigator check parameter toxicity measure metabolites methionine catabolism day dose intervention , intervention ( 2 week start dose intervention ; range : +/- 3 day ) , last day dose intervention , 2 week last dose intervention . Because methionine dietary supplement clearly rise safety issue , conduct experiment step . First , subject receive 10 mg/kg body weight/day . The investigator analyse parameter toxicity , interpret data safety concern , continue next intake level . The study stop level apparent safety concern . The study take place research facility Center Translational Research Aging Longevity ( CTRAL ) , Texas A &amp; M University . The subject ask arrive fasted state screening study day . On screen day , body weight height measure Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry ( DXA ) perform measure body composition . On SD LD medical interview perform toxicity questionnaire complete ( see attach protocol ) . Furthermore SD two blood sample take ( 30 ml ) . On LD , one catheter insert peripheral vein arm blood sampling ( 18 sample total , 80 ml per LD ) questionnaires related cognition , health status well may may complete subject ( see attach protocol ) . After baseline blood sample take , stable isotope pulse provide line . The baseline sample use test toxicity parameter blood , plasma homocysteine concentration , plasma concentration product methionine degrade transamination sulfoxidation route , establish background enrichment stable isotope . Samples obtain pulse provide information transmethylation methionine , GSH synthesis . Subjects call every week check compliance regard supplement intake answer question regard health well-being . Subjects discontinue study study replace .</detailed_description>
