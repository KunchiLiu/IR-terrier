	<brief_title>An Evaluation Optimal Dose Tofacitinib Needed Achieve Low Disease Activity ( LDA ) Clinical Remission Patients With Active Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) Measured From Clinical Structural Perspective</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study evaluate optimal dose tofacitinib need achieve low disease activity ( LDA ) clinical remission measure CDAI score . Once LDA clinical remission achieve , structural benefit reduce erosion , synovitis bone edema measure low field MRI determine time period use OMERACT/RAMRIS score system correlate clinical finding . The target patient determine time study entry depend degree disease activity individual patient . This base understanding LDA acceptable goal certain patient long stand disease high disease activity . If patient reach LDA take tofacitinib 5 mg b.i.d . dose , patient give opportunity dose increase 10 mg b.i.d . hop reach clinical remission . There two treat target goal : Clinical Remission define CDAI score &lt; 2.8 patient enter study CDAI score &lt; 22 Low Disease Activity ( LDA ) define CDAI score &lt; 10 enter study CDAI score &gt; 22 .</detailed_description>
