	<brief_summary>The human performance weightlessness test multiplicity laboratory experiment parabolic flight space . It therefore known human fine motor skill grasp affected impact change gravity level . However , everyday life movement differ several aspect do experimental lab situation , investigator know know kind movement alter extend . Fine motor skill seem depend context make . Thus , performance weightlessness everyday life could substantially differ result give previous laboratory study . This assumption test present project , subject execute one grasp movement two different context , normal gravity condition weightlessness . To end , investigator develop new method allow compare grasp movement different condition .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigations description Subjects sit table front 15 '' computer screen , centrally locate joystick slide lever right side . All device fix table . The subject hand fit six adhesive reflexive marker hand movement register two MX-F20 Vicon-Cameras , attach table-fixed metal frame . Lever force register ATI Nano17 force transducer , lever fore-aft position inductive encoder , eye position eye tracker ( Tobii T60 ) . Subjects perform two different task , one represent typical laboratory ( L ) , one everyday-like task ( E ) . In task L , visual stimulus screen prompt subject release joystick , grasp lever , move forward back , return hand joystick . In task E , subject use joystick computer game ( `` spider chasing '' ) occasionally release joystick , grasp lever , move forward back order collect reward , return hand joystick . In tasks visual stimulus accompany acoustic signal . To hear signal flight procedure , subject equip ear-phones , plug laptop . In one 20 second microgravity episode , task L perform five time task E twice . The investigator start task click keyboard stop automatically 20sec . Control data register subject length time level flight 1g . During whole test procedure subject constraint natural behaviour except easy open belt fix subject chair . The subject time end experiment . Equipment use For hand motion measurement analysis use Vicon MX System , consist two MX20+ infrared high-speed camera , connect via cable MX Ultranet process data . The Ultranet connect network cable correspond laptop ( Dell ) . Force measure 6 degree freedom force transducer part ATI DAQ F/T System , consist force sensor Nano 17 , power supply box booster 16-bit A/D converter ( DAQ-Card , NI 6036E ) . It use PCMCIA bus second laptop ( Fujitsu ) . The position object move measure inductive position encoder ( dc position encoder type 8740-5100 burster ) . The eye movement record standard USB-camera commercial eye-tracker ( Tobii T60 ) available . All device commercially available use accord CE marking . Experimental protocol Before flight subject familiarise protocol . Two subject study flight . On ground , subject get 6 reflexive marker ( 6mm diameter ) stick right hand ( 4 index , 2 thumb , fix double sided adhesive tape ) . The first subject take seat experimental set-up , second one aircraft seat . The tested subject equip ear-phones plugged laptop . It help focus attention task accompany acoustic signal . Recording device adjust subject standard calibration procedure , do test-operator . Before enter first parabola subject execute two grasping-tasks level flight . After first test parabola , 0g period execute grasp movement one task - 4 parabola task L five episode , 10 parabola task E two episode . Entering 0g phase operator start test click keyboard , afterwards task stop automatically . During 1g 1,8g phase test interrupt . After 15th parabola subject switch place second one start test 0g phase . On level flight back airport execute two task control condition .</detailed_description>
