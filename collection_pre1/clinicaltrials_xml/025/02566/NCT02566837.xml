	<brief_summary>Intramuscular injection botulinum toxin currently best focal treatment spasticity , clearly defined indication role . French European recommendation focus toxin 's mode administration , must precise possible . The toxin 's specific action motor endplate ( block release acetylcholine ) show importance target injection within muscle belly . The pain cause injection due partly number injection ( 30 single session ) , partly use electrical stimulation guidance . Prevention alleviation pain cause injection become regulatory obligation since law 4 March 2002 relate right patient quality health system ( `` Any person right receive relief pain , must , circumstance , prevent , evaluate , take account treat … `` ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Ultrasound Injections Botulinum Toxin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Electrical stimulation guidance generally use nowadays , recommend use palpation anatomical landmark . However , electrical stimulation limit . It sometimes poorly tolerated patient cause pain , great muscle less responsive stimulation require strong electrical current . The pain also increase number injection perform single session . Electrical stimulation guarantee certain needle place within muscle , stimulation aponeurosis may cause muscle contract excitation motor branch enter muscle . The injection botulinum toxin aponeurosis provide satisfactory effect may render injection ineffective . In patient , muscle inject may present degree retraction fat degeneration , reduce sensitivity electrical stimulation . Individual patient may also respond poorly electrical stimulation , cause technical treatment problem . Finally , certain muscle difficult locate electrical stimulation contraction produce weak mechanical effect ( e.g . short muscle interossei muscle ) . All factor explain ultrasound image provide interesting alternative guidance technique botulinum toxin injection . In case , replace electrical stimulation altogether , thus avoid pain cause . Ultrasound guidance already recommend pediatric patient improve comfort injection . In study , patient 's comfort injection choose main endpoint already demonstrate child investigator feel essential aspect routine practice . Moreover , ultrasound image helps locate accurately muscle inject . Once tip needle locate , tracked injection , guide muscle belly . Previous study already show technique improve efficacy injection . Ultrasound image also interest muscle inject located deep plane close vital structure , nerve , artery , vein ( e.g . piriformis psoas ) . All consideration study child validate adult spastic patient well . Therefore , investigator compare ultrasound guidance electrical stimulation guidance routine clinical practice . This study carry adult spastic patient may receive botulinum toxin injection Service Physical Medicine Rehabilitation University Teaching Hospital . The aim analyse advantage injection technique current practice condition . The evaluate physician ( blind ) conduct clinical examination patient injection , 6 8 week injection botulinum toxin . The pain associate toxin injection evaluate injection follow-up visit , use vertical indexed VAS Face Pain Scale . The spasticity evaluate Tardieu scale injection follow-up visit . The duration botulinum toxin injection measure . Finally , functional objective determine prior injection . The GAS ( Goal Attainment Scaling ) methodology use follow-up visit determine whether objective meet .</detailed_description>
