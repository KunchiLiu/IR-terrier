	<brief_summary>This clinical pilot trial intend evaluate feasibility , efficacy safety hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) -mismatched related donor child young adult hematologic malignancy lack suitably match relate unrelated donor .

	<brief_title>Stem Cell Transplantation From HLA Partially-Matched Related Donors Patients With Hematologic Malignancies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Allogeneic HSCT potentially curative therapy number malignancy . A barrier institution potentially curative strategy hematologic malignancy availability donor . Only 30 % patient North America Europe may benefit allogeneic HSCT available HLA match sibling donor . The ability find matched sibling donor proportional number child family . Because decrease size nuclear family , become less likely patient HLA identical match sibling . Registries provide match unrelated allogeneic stem cell graft additional 30 % patient . However option patient match registry , whose disease status preclude wait identify appropriate unrelated donor . The ability find well match unrelated donor even limit segment population mixed race ancestry well African Americans , high degree HLA diversity , unlikely find unrelated donor match HLA type . In setting easy faster identify partially HLA-matched ( haploidentical ) family member stem cell donor . The use haploidentical donor broaden application HSCT limit family size racial/ethnic HLA diversity . Because parent child , well sibling use haploidentical donor , type transplant enfranchise almost every segment population . Since , study , donor lymphoid stem cell portion graft collect administered different time point condition regimen , approach haploidentical HSCT refer 2 Step regimen . The approach involve ex vivo T cell depletion , use cyclophosphamide tolerize donor lymphocyte within framework myeloablative conditioning regimen . Preliminary experience approach adult patient Thomas Jefferson University myeloablative haploidentical HSCT date back 2005 first trial use myeloablative conditioning formally launched 2006 . That initial trial meet accrual goal current trial one successor trial derive experience . The condition regimen include total body irradiation ( TBI ) ( 1.5 Gray x 8 ) CY ( 60 mg/kg x 2 ) . Tacrolimus Mycophenolate Mofetil ( MMF ) use post-transplant immunosuppression relatively standard fashion . The novel aspect regimen administration graft . If one considers standard allograft consist two component , lymphoid portion stem cell portion , unique administration two portion separately , different time point condition regimen rather together . The lymphoid portion , include fix dose CD3+ cells/kg administer prior cyclophosphamide hematopoietic stem cell ( HSC ) portion graft administer cyclophosphamide metabolize eliminate . Thus , transplant occur 2 step .</detailed_description>
