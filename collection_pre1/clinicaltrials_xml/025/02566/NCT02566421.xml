	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study patient ' genomic sequencing determine specific treatment , also call Precision Medicine , patient cancer spread part body ( metastatic ) and/or remove surgery . Examining genetic code patient 's tumor , mutation ( change deoxyribonucleic acid [ DNA ] sequence cell gene ) may identify matched available treatment target mutate gene alternative treatment may provide benefit patient mutation identify . Precision medicine may impact patient 's response treatment target specific mutation may increase survival improve quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess feasibility implement Precision Oncology protocol treatment patient undergo genomic sequencing . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine treatment response rate patient receive target treatment versus receive target treatment . II . To assess survival patient receive target treatment versus receive target treatment . III . To assess change patient-reported outcome patient receive target treatment versus receive target treatment . IV . To perform exploratory statistical genetic bioinformatics analysis use data derive genomic sequence catalogue additional important variant determine whether pattern association among patient level risk factor , outcomes genomic information identify original genomic sequencing analysis . OUTLINE : Patients receive treatment base result genomic sequencing analysis . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2 month .</detailed_description>
