	<brief_title>Effect Pre-Treatment With Cromolyn Albuterol Response PUL-042 Inhalation Solution ( PUL-042 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy subject ( 8 per cohort ) randomize either pre-treatment pre-treatment ( 4 per group ) . The initial cohort receive pre-treatment cromolyn sodium . Subjects follow 2 week safety tolerability , undergo 2 week washout period assign alternative treatment ( i.e. , subject receive cromolyn sodium prior PUL-042 inhalation solution receive pretreatment ) follow additional 2 week . Subsequent cohort receive pre-treatment albuterol sulfate like manner .</detailed_description>
