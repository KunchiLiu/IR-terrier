	<brief_summary>Purpose : The purpose pilot study evaluate effect multi-component balance &amp; resistance training [ RT ] intervention physical function , balance , &amp; fall old [ ≥ 65 y/o ] community dwell heart failure [ HF ] patient . The study aim : 1 ] Pilot test multi-component balance activity &amp; RT intervention primary outcome . 2 ] Explore perception relate outcomes &amp; intervention focus group . 3 ] Generate pilot data adherence . 4 ] Generate pilot data feasibility conduct BASIC Training intervention . Background/Significance : Falls lead cause injury-related death group . Fall risk even great HF due decrease exercise capacity , loss skeletal muscle &amp; medication side effect . Though RT effective improve skeletal muscle , modest effect improve balance , comprised peripheral sensory input central integration , &amp; motor output . A multi-component intervention focus balance retrain &amp; strengthen muscle support static/dynamic balance &amp; functional mobility necessary . Methods : Design - Randomized , two-group wait list control , repeat measure experimental design . Sample/ Setting - 40-50 participant recruit medical center heart failure clinic ; supervise group session conduct center 's health &amp; wellness center . Procedures - Participants randomize intervention group wait list control group . Focus group pre/post intervention . The intervention administer 1x per week supervise group session &amp; 2x week home session . Instruments - 30 Second Sit-to-St &amp; , Modified Clinical Test Sensory Interaction Balance , Activity Specific Balance Confidence Scale , Timed Up &amp; Go , Dynamic Gait Index . Analysis Plan : Aim 1- independent t-test compare change score baseline end first 12 week period intervention group wait list control group . A second analysis combine data delay intervention period wait list control group first 12 week period intervention group test change . Supplemental analysis , involve data intervention group , test whether change sustain 24 week . Aim 2 - thematic analysis conduct focus group data . Aim 3 - adherence assess group session attendance &amp; home activity complete . Aim 4 - ass &amp; report logistics conduct study . Nursing Relevance/Implications : This pilot study initiate process develop target intervention induce change elderly HF patient prevent future fall ; thus reduce cost , physical &amp; emotional burden related fall ; &amp; effect major difference quality life population .</brief_summary>
