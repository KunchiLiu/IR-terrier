	<brief_summary>One third independent old adult age 65y hospitalize acute medical illness , injury , operative procedure . Unfortunately , 50 % old adult experience functional decline hospital stay amount time physically inactive bed . Following discharge , functional deficit persist month many instance never return pre-hospitalization level thus compound morbidity , health care cost die . A classic consequence short-term bed rest older adult significant loss skeletal muscle mass underlies accelerate leg strength deficit . The investigator show important mechanism skeletal muscle loss inability nutrient stimulate normal muscle protein synthesis response ; process highly regulate mammalian target rapamycin signal pathway ( mTOR ) amino acid transporter . Day day maintenance force generate muscle tissue dictate anabolic stimulation muscle contraction essential amino acid ingestion . Therefore , anabolic intervention neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) high quality protein supplementation contain high proportion essential amino acid ( whey protein ) may promise approach maintain leg muscle mass strength hospitalize old adult prevent long term consequence repeat period short-term physical inactivity . The purpose study test older adult combination NMES protein supplementation capable preserve muscle mass strength maintain muscle nutrient anabolic sensitivity bed rest . The investigator current hypothesis daily NMES protein supplementation 5-days bed rest older adult : 1 ) preserve low extremity muscle mass strength 2 ) maintain muscle nutrient anabolic sensitivity measure mTOR signal amino acid transporter expression . The long term goal utilize inpatient preventative therapeutic approach clinical set muscle mass strength deficit profound ( e.g. , intensive care patient ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>A majority old adult experience repeat period physical inactivity acute illness , injury operative procedure . Following discharge hospital , daily activity adversely impact . Infirmity follow repeat period inactivity ( term `` catabolic hit '' ) occur old adult ' lifespan lead downward spiral potentially irrecoverable deficit physical function result increase health care cost , loss independence , premature death . The hallmark sign short-term physical inactivity old adult rapid deterioration skeletal muscle mass strength . Understandably , little attention place physical function requisite period inactivity medical management and/or postoperative recuperation focus . However , muscle deficit follow result acute hospitalization profound long-term consequence . Muscle contraction essential amino acid powerful independent anabolic stimulus fundamental maintain skeletal muscle mass strength . The primary mechanism disuse atrophy short-term bed rest older adult reduce acute nutrient stimulation muscle protein synthesis regulate mammalian target rapamycin ( mTOR ) signal pathway amino acid transporter expression ( i.e. , LAT1 ) . Intervening essential amino acid supplement maintain muscle function old adult bed rest , preserve muscle mass . Neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) muscle intervention also feasible , alone panacea . NMES recently show acutely stimulate protein synthesis ambulatory old adult diabetes attenuate loss muscle mass critically ill patient . The investigator suggest , together , daily NMES , high quality protein source EAAs ( PRO ) , potent two-pronged approach preserve loss muscle strength old adult confine short-term bed rest . The goal test combination NMES PRO maintain muscle mass , strength , nutrient-induced mTOR signal amino acid transporter expression old adult bed rest . The central hypothesis project support next step daily combination NMES PRO older adult experience bed rest preserve : 1 ) leg muscle mass knee extensor strength 2 ) muscle anabolic sensitivity response acute nutrient ingestion , measure mTOR signal LAT1 expression .</detailed_description>
