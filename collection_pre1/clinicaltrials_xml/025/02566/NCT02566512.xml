	<brief_summary>The investigator propose assess cough strength patient undergo spontaneous breathe trial Intermediate Intensive Care Unit ( IICU ) compare cough strength two condition , 1 . Tracheostomy cuff inflate : cough strength measure tracheostomy cuff inflate patient cough tracheostomy tube . 2 . Tracheostomy cuff deflate : cough strength measure tracheostomy cuff deflate patient cough around tracheostomy tube , mouth.. The investigator hypothesize patient strong cough use vocal cord .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Cough Strength Patients With Tracheostomies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>When patient recover initial respiratory insult precipitate respiratory failure , patient may need prolonged period time wean completely mechanical ventilation . One method wean mechanical ventilation involve patient breath spontaneously without assistance ventilator . This refer spontaneous breathe trial . Over time , duration spontaneous breathe gradually increase patient able breathe entirely . Traditionally , tracheostomy cuff keep inflated patient breathe entirely ( 2,3 ) . A recent study assess effect deflate tracheostomy tube cuff wean mechanical ventilation ( 4 ) . Patients , require prolonged mechanical ventilation tracheostomy , wean use T piece trial . They randomize two group : control group tracheostomy cuff kept inflate ; study group tracheostomy cuff deflate . The study group , cuff deflate , short time wean ventilator , few respiratory infection improve swallow . This attributed increase effective airway diameter , would decrease resistive work breathing . The author comment effect cuff deflation may cough clearance secretion . It postulate patient cough effectively he/she use vocal cord generate cough oppose cough tracheostomy tube vocal cord bypass . It previously demonstrate patient strong cough tracheostomy tube remove compare tracheostomy tube place ( 5 ) . Patient population The study group include adult patient IICU , prolong mechanical ventilation spontaneous breathe trial part wean protocol . Patients require give write , informed consent . Exclusion criteria Any patient leak around tracheostomy tube tracheostomy cuff inflate . Inability understand English cognitive impairment impair patient 's ability follow direction . Protocol Baseline demographic information collect patient . This include age , sex , height , weight , BMI , diagnosis , initial date intubation ICU admission , date tracheostomy , date admission IICU , type size tracheostomy tube . Baseline measurement respiratory strength make patient . These include vital capacity ( VC ) , maximal inspiratory pressure ( MIP ) , maximal expiratory pressure ( MEP ) . These standard measurement , routinely do IICU . All measurement do patient head sit position tracheostomy cuff inflate . Measurement cough strength do use Air Zone Peak Expiratory Flow meter . This do patient head sit position . With tracheostomy cuff inflate , peak expiratory flow meter attach directly tracheostomy tube . The patient instruct take big breath forcefully cough . This repeat four time . The first measurement discard ( learn curve ) . The peak expiratory flow record next three measurement . The three measurement deviate 10 % , best result record . With tracheostomy cuff deflate , one-way valve attach tracheostomy tube . The patient use mouthpiece connect peak expiratory flow meter . The patient instruct take big breath forcefully cough . This repeat four time . The first measurement discard ( learn curve ) . The peak expiratory flow record next three measurement . The three measurement deviate 10 % , best result record . The patient randomize start either tracheostomy cuff inflate deflate . At end measurement , patient return usual care . The entire study take approximately ten minute . The investigator propose study 20 consecutive adult patient IICU . Data analysis The best expiratory flow measurement average together tracheostomy cuff inflate tracheostomy cuff deflate . The value compare use Student 's T test . A p value &lt; 0.05 consider significant .</detailed_description>
