	<brief_summary>The main goal project assess ability recently develop Breast Microwave Imaging ( BMI ) system detect abnormality human breast . These trial perform recruit fourteen volunteer diagnose breast abnormality use x-ray mammography . The breast present abnormality image use BMI system control comfortable environment . As feasibility study technology , main goal evaluate diagnostic accuracy technology . The data collect study use : ( 1 ) evaluate overall participant experience BMI imaging procedure , ( 2 ) optimize design BMI imaging system ( hardware software ) , ( 3 ) open discussion medical professional ( e.g . radiologist ) clinical feasibility emerge diagnostic imaging modality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Performance Assessment First Generation Breast Microwave Imaging System : Study Breast Abnormalities Detection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Breast Microwave Imaging ( BMI ) system use study design detect breast abnormality use low power microwave waveform . The system form three main component : 1 . Patient bed . The volunteer position bed prone position breast image pendant position . 2 . Instrumentation rack . This component contain microwave instrumentation motion mechanism require illuminate breast use ultrawide band waveform record responses breast structure . 3 . Control computer . This component use control motion mechanical component system retrieve response breast structure microwave instrument store electronic format . The system take 7.5 10 minute collect three dimensional dataset single breast . The BMI system use study operate frequency range 20 megahertz ( MHz ) 9 gigahertz ( GHz ) . Canadian safety limit interaction non-ionizing electromagnetic wave human outline Health Canada publication `` Safety Code 6 : Limits Human Exposure Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Energy Frequency Range 3 kilohertz ( kHz ) 300 GHz [ 1 ] . For unregulated environment , Specific Absorption Rate ( SAR ) limit set Health Canada 1.6 W/Kg . In system use study , radio-frequency energy generate via Vector Network Analyzer ( VNA ) . If VNA set maximum output power , 3.2 milliwatt ( mW ) , power receive 5 cm antenna ( distance breast ) measure 890 microwatt , would yield SAR value 0.0196 W/kg .
