	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : parentoffspring trios/quartets select group approximately 450 trio offspring born 42 week last significant parental Chernobylrelated exposure . The offspring either sex Must adult ( age ( Bullet ) 18 year interview ) ; If one child bear give set parent , first last eligible sibling select participation , interest maximize variation time last exposure conception , also maximize signal ( include offspring close time exposure , less likelihood removal damage sperm/oocytes , include offspring furthest time exposure , less likelihood direct exposure child , maximize cumulative parental preconception gonadal dose ) . Twins especially informative give comparable exposure utero early life . A high proportion trios/quartets currently reside Kyiv . The majority trios/quartets undergone regular medical examination result followup CER . Most expected alive . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Those locate Those offspring born within 42 week last significant Chernobylrelated exposure Those parent offspring find cancer Those refuse participate study , provide informed consent .</criteria>
