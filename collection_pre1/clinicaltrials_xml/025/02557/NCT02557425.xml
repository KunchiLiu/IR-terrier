	<brief_summary>Each year , ~85.3 million pregnant woman risk become infect Plasmodium falciparum ( 1 ) . Among woman sub-Saharan Africa , degree clinical immunity malaria , malaria infection pregnancy lead placental malaria ( PM ) , often without clinical symptom mother . The systemic placental change occur malaria pregnancy adversely affect develop fetal brain , fetal brain injury strongly affect long-term childhood neurodevelopmental ( ND ) behavior publish study date impact malaria pregnancy childhood ND . This study , conduct Uganda , address effect malaria pregnancy childhood ND define mechanism malaria may lead ND impairment include micronutrient deficiency . ND outcomes measure follow neuropsychological behavioral test : Mullen Scales Early Learning , Color Object Association Test , Early Childhood Vigilance Test , Behavior Rating Scales , Behavior Related inventory Executive Function Child Behavior Checklist . These test give 12 , 24 36 month age . This study nest ongoing Ugandan IRB approve interventional trial ( PROMOTE-II ) ( NCT02163447 ) . Blood sample conduct PROMOTE-II protocol research purpose . Some blood use test micronutrient deficiency well immune response malaria .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prophylaxis Against Malaria Enhance Child Development ( PROTECT Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The PROMOTE-II randomize clinical trial Tororo , Uganda , lead investigator Makerere University Uganda University California-San Francisco ( UCSF ) , provide ideal set assess effect malaria prevention pregnant woman child childhood ND . In PROMOTE-II Project 1,300 pregnant HIV-uninfected woman randomize 12-20 week gestation malaria prophylaxis 3 dos sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine ( current standard care ) , 3 dos dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DP ) , monthly DP . Their child randomize receive DP prophylaxis monthly every 3 month 2 24 month age . The child follow malaria episode birth age 36 month . The propose prospective study child ND , Prophylaxis malaria To Enhance Child developmenT ( PROTECT ) study , nest within PROMOTE-II Project 1 cohort . It hypothesize mother SP mother child less frequent prophylaxis malaria episode . The investigator predict child ND improve effective prophylaxis . The central hypothesis study malaria prevention pregnant woman child improve child ND 1 ) prevention placental sequestration inflammation consequent micronutrient deficiency fetus , 2 ) reduction systemic inflammation endothelial activation lead micronutrient deficiency anemia pregnancy early childhood thus alteration brain structure particularly sensitive deficiency ( e.g. , hippocampus , myelin frontal lobe ) . The collaborative team , expertise malaria pregnant woman child , malaria pathogenesis , micronutrient deficiency , fetal child neurodevelopment , model complex disease pathway , well qualified undertake propose research . The specific aim study : Aim 1 . Determine effect malaria prevention pregnant woman child child ND . Hypotheses : 1 ) Long-term child ND improve effective chemoprevention pregnant woman child . 2 ) The effect malaria prevention child ND persist 36 month age . Child ND assess test battery validate previous study group Ugandan child . The investigator test hypothesis compare child ND 12 , 24 36 month age treatment group . Aim 2 . Identify major mechanism malaria prevention pregnant woman child affect child ND . Hypotheses : 1 ) Malaria prevention pregnant woman affect child ND prevention placental sequestration inflammation , consequent prevention prematurity , intrauterine growth retardation fetal micronutrient deficiency . 2 ) Malaria prevention pregnant woman child birth improve child ND reduction systemic inflammation , endothelial activation , micronutrient deficiency anemia , relative contribution factor differ pregnant woman compare child . The investigator test hypothesis conduct path analysis determine network include path explain significant proportion difference child ND treatment group .</detailed_description>
