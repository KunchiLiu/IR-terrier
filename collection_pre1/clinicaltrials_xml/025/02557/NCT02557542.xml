	<detailed_description>OBJECTIVES - Primary Objective Measure quality-adjusted life year ( QALY ) gain 3 month ( use EuroQoL 's EQ-5D ) &amp; AVVQ patient randomise treatment One Stop Vein Clinic patient randomise treatment normal care pathway - Secondary Objective - Patient satisfaction service provide use Picker patient experience questionnaire post-operatively 3 month follow-up ( One Stop Vein Clinic versus Normal Care Pathway ) - Measure compare quality life score use CIVIQ 0 3 month patient randomise treatment One Stop Vein Clinic patient randomise Normal Care Pathway - Record time referral treatment ( RTT ) - Assess cost-effectiveness One Stop Vein clinic compare normal care pathway - Record time return normal activity work - Assess estimate societal cost BACKGROUND Varicose vein common condition , affect approximately 25 % population . Over 35,000 varicose vein procedure currently carry UK . However , new 2013 NICE guideline , Department Health estimate set increase 50,000 per year . Waiting varicose vein intervention show detrimental severity condition quality life patient . Progression varicose vein also lead complication leg ulceration costly health service . Over past decade , new endovenous technique introduce felt cost-effective , especially , perform outpatient 'office-based ' setting . At present , patient refer Vascular unit consideration management varicose vein attend outpatient clinic least twice prior listed procedure . At present , patient refer Vascular Outpatient Clinics consideration varicose vein management initial appointment severity venous insufficiency assess clinically , subsequently , venous Duplex scan evaluate extent cause venous incompetence . If treatable lesion find , add wait list come eventual varicose vein procedure . This mean , attend least two outpatient appointment attend another appointment venous scan , actually attend varicose vein procedure . Waiting varicose vein intervention show lead worsening condition clinically radiologically . In addition , quality life patient wait elective surgery adversely affect . In order evaluate patient ' idea expectation respect provision varicose vein service investigator 's unit , conduct survey patient attend Vascular Outpatient Clinic March June 2014 . One hundred six patient complete anonymous questionnaire . Most female ( 62.4 % ) mean age 51 ± 15 year . More 90 % patient state waiting time Vascular appointment venous scan 1 month 85 % patient believe varicose vein procedure receive within 1 month Vascular clinic appointment . Ninety percent patient agreeable attend 'one-stop ' vein clinic offering day diagnosis treatment . Patients generally accept fact procedure would carry local anaesthetic ( 89 % ) . Hence , appear patient unit preference one stop clinic . This concept new pilot speciality good success - one-stop carpal tunnel clinic well one stop cataract clinic show feasible good patient satisfaction . Both laparoscopic open inguinal hernia repair , patient receive general anaesthetic , carry successfully use one stop model offer day diagnosis treatment . There currently already 'see treat ' service skin lump operate many NHS Trusts already one stop carpal tunnel service provide Imperial College NHS Trust . It would appear one stop clinic advantage reduce number unnecessary hospital visit well possibly lead cost saving health service . As result , investigator intend evaluate one stop model within varicose vein service . They assess feasibility one-stop vein clinic , patient assess , venous Duplex scan , depend lesion show , venous treatment day . The hypothetical benefit stratagem improvement patient satisfaction , reduction number appointment , abolition wait time well cost saving health saving . METHODS GP referral screen patient meet inclusion criterion invite take part trial . They send information pack containing : 1 . Information leaflet trial 2 . Information varicose vein , treatment telephone number helpline 3 . The Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire ( AVVQ ) , Chronic Venous Disease Quality Life Questionnaire ( CIVIQ ) EuroQoL 's quality life questionnaire ( EQ-5D ) 4 . Consent form participate study Patients agree part trial consent randomised either : 1 . The One Stop Vein Clinic ( offer day diagnosis treatment ) ; 2 . The normal care pathway Once patient indicate consent participate , General Practitioners ( GP ) send letter inform patient 's participation study . Patients decline partake randomise part study , agreeable complete study questionnaire continue normal care pathway , also consent . Further information provide attend clinic appointment consent process take place attend subsequent procedure One Stop Vein Clinic Pathway Patients attend One Stop Vein Clinic review Vascular Surgeon , confirm patient 's consent trial , assess degree venous disease fill Clinical-Etiology-Anatomy-Pathophysiology ( CEAP ) classification Varicose Clinical Severity Score ( VCSS ) . If patient 's symptom deem secondary venous disease , send Duplex scan confirm presence venous disease . The result review Vascular Surgeons , patient suitable endovenous ablation +/- avulsion UGFS , inform finding scan propose treatment . If happy go ahead propose intervention , consent transfer wait area wait intervention . If , however , decline day treatment , put onto conventional care pathway . Another Vascular Surgeon carry intervention 'office-based ' environment local anaesthetic . Once do , patient ask fill Picker patient experience questionnaire . They subsequently discharge , similar current practice , give diary card fill return normal activity work . Three ( 3 ) month post-operatively , ask fill AVVQ , CIVIQ , EQ-5D Picker patient experience questionnaire . This do sending questionnaire post . The Normal Care Pathway ( NCP ) In normal care pathway , patient refer GP see outpatient clinic , symptom suggestive varicose vein disease , send venous duplex scan . This usually happen different day . Afterwards , see back clinic ( different day ) , scan result suggest venous incompetence amenable day case treatment , add wait list . The eventual procedure take place time later ( within 18 week referral treatment ) . After procedure , ask fill Picker patient experience questionnaire . On discharge , give diary card fill return normal activity work . At 3 month post intervention , patient randomise normal care pathway send QoL questionnaire ask fill AVVQ , CIVIQ , EQ-5D Picker patient experience questionnaire . As inherent delay NCP pathway , time randomisation use many patient receive interventional treatment . Inclusion Exclusion Criteria The inclusion criterion : 1 . Adults age 18 year 2 . Unilateral low limb symptom suggestive venous disease referral letter The exclusion criterion : 1 . Recurrent varicose vein 2 . Known arterial disease ABPI &lt; 0.8 3 . Current deep vein thrombosis 4 . Patients withdraw consent 5 . Inability complete questionnaire attend follow appointment 6 . Currently enrol venous study PATIENT SELECTION This pilot randomise control study patient select follow screen GP referral letter . CONSENT As part consent process , patient give three option . 1 . Patients wish attend One Stop Vein Clinic participate study ask indicate consent sign consent form fill reply slip . Patients randomise either One Stop Vein Clinic group Normal Care Pathway ( NCP ) group . 2 . Patients wish attend One Stop Vein Clinic participate study ask indicate filling reply slip . They instead attend normal care pathway . They , however , ask , agreeable complete QoL Picker patient experience form . 3 . Patients decline either trial simple service evaluation offer NCP . TREATMENT ALLOCATION Treatment receive depend finding venous Duplex scan . All treatment minimally invasive endovenous ablation procedure ( either radio-frequency ablation , endovenous laser ablation mechano-chemical ablation ) , avulsion ultrasound-guided foam sclerotherapy . All procedure carry local anaesthetic patient discharge home later day , current standard care . MEASUREMENT OF OUTCOMES Primary Outcome • Measure quality-adjusted life year ( QALY ) gain 3 month ( patient randomise treatment One Stop Vein Clinic patient randomise treatment Normal Care Pathway ) Secondary Outcome - Patient satisfaction service provide use Picker patient experience questionnaire post-operatively 3 month follow-up ( One Stop Vein Clinic versus Normal Care Pathway ) - Measure compare quality life score use EQ-5D , AVVQ CIVIQ 0 3 month patient randomise treatment One Stop Vein Clinic patient randomise Normal Care Pathway - Time referral treatment - Assess cost-effectiveness One Stop Vein clinic compare normal care pathway - Record time return normal activity work - Assess estimate societal cost STUDY DURATION &amp; SAMPLE SIZE Following screen GP referral letter , patient varicose vein disease invite participate study . It estimate 12-14 patient invited weekly basis participate study follow screening . Out , 8 patient expect agree randomise One Stop Vein Clinic Normal Care Pathway . If clinic hold weekly , approximately 416 patient could recruit course year ( 8 patient X 52 week ) . Statistical analysis suggest sample size 208 patient per group would able power potential phase 3 multicentre randomise control trial . Compared previous study conduct investigator ' unit involve 317 patient total look different quality life score responsiveness11 , coefficient variation ( ratio standard deviation mean ) find increase follow-up period vary among different score use . With large sample size pilot study , variability would reduce result small coefficient variation look follow-up score . Hopefully , enable u identify QoL score least variability use primary outcome measure future Phase 3 study . A primary outcome measure little variability would provide u enough information estimate adequate sample size future randomise controlled trial . For example , sample size 208 patient coefficient variation 0.5 , 15 % reduction geometric mean ( measure central tendency , similar median ) would require compare 25 % Shepherd et al . study . With power 85 % , would allow u determine adequate sample size . Participants followed-up post-procedure 3 month , include patient randomise Normal Care Pathway ( potentially longer wait time referral treatment ) . This mean study period 18 month . With 3 month study start-up 3 month write study , study last 24 month . Approximately 1,000 patient undergo varicose vein procedures Imperial College NHS Trust every year . COST BENEFIT OF PROJECT The hypothesis along improved patient satisfaction improve wait time outpatient appointment , cost saving derive One Stop Vein Clinic . On average , 1,000 patient treat every year Imperial College NHS Trust cost outpatient attendance approximately £93 . Savings could make patient see treat first appointment rather attend another two appointment . The potential cost saving estimate order £186,000 annually ( £93 x 1,000 X 2 ) . Estimated societal cost . Data collect time work carer 's duty ( child/relative/friend ) . Additionally , data income , cost attend clinic impact family colleague assess estimate societal cost two pathway .</detailed_description>
