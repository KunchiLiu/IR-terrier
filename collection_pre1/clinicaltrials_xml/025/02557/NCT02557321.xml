	<detailed_description>Up 24 eligible subject enrol Phase 1b portion study . Each subject cohort receive combination IL PV-10 pembrolizumab . A total estimated 120 eligible subject randomize 1:1 ratio two treatment arm ( i.e. , PV-10 + pembrolizumab pembrolizumab alone ) Phase 2 portion study . This number subject may modify base emerge evidence preliminary efficacy effect size Phase 1b portion study . Subjects assign receive PV-10 Phase 1b 2 receive initial IL PV-10 injectable cutaneous subcutaneous lesion commence study Day 1 13 week ( i.e. , investigational Treatment Phase study ) . PV-10 may re-administered 21-day ( 3-week ) interval Treatment Phase study remain , uninjected cutaneous subcutaneous lesion injectable cutaneous subcutaneous lesion inject . Lesions fail exhibit complete ablation may re-injected schedule . Pembrolizumab administer 21-day ( 3-week ) interval per prescribe information ( label ) commence study Day 1 24 month disease progression , toxicity require discontinuation study treatment study termination .</detailed_description>
