	<brief_title>Mobilization Mesenchymal Stem Cells During Liver Transplantation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Mesenchymal stem cell ( MSCs ) know immune modulator significant immunosuppressive effect . MSCs emerge promise frontier human clinical trial . MSCs show non-immunogenic making capable transplantation across allogeneic barrier . These quality make MSCs ideal candidate study involve reduce rejection graft , case , liver transplant . If , information would highly significant would lead significant reduction use immunosuppressant replacement MSCs . This serve dual purpose : reduce clinical problem associate pharmacological immunosuppression ( discuss next paragraph ) ; additional help protection transplant liver MSCs . The use immunosuppressant particular vital organ transplantation include liver transplant patient . However , use accompany numerous drawback reactivation viral hepatitis , opportunistic infection complication . If MSCs use decrease use immunosuppressive agent liver transplant patient lead significant decrease morbidity mortality consequence liver transplantation . Hepatic macrophage , ie Kupffer cell , know function recruit monocyte liver . They show proinflammatory effect attract monocyte liver . They also interact hepatic stellate cell ( HSCs ) pro-fibrogenic function . However , show anti-inflammatory effect well , implicate role fibrosis regression . Hepatic macrophage interest new target therapeutic intervention effect steroid kupffer cell well interaction MSCs fully explore . Patient attach standard American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) monitor include pulse oximetry , electrocardiogram , noninvasive blood pressure monitoring temperature capnometry . Patients place general anesthesia endotracheal intubation control ventilation . As customary liver surgery , arterial line insert blood pressure monitor repeat blood sample . If indicate , pulmonary artery catheter insert . Anesthesia maintain use volatile agent . Paralysis provide use non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent anesthesiologist 's choice . As standard practice hourly blood sample take arterial line analyze Protime ( PT ) /International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) /Complete Blood Count/electrolytes . Red Blood Cells , Fresh Frozen Plasma platelet transfuse necessary . As customary liver transplant recipient give customary dose methylprednisolone immune suppression anhepatic phase . Intraoperatively , patient undergo transplant three blood sample collect arterial line study purpose . Each sample contain 3cc blood . The time point blood sample follow : - Immediately arterial line placement baseline - In anhepatic stage prior steroid injection - Two hour administration steroid Post-operatively , two additional 3 mL blood sample take member study team . The first postoperative day 1 prior administration immunosuppressive drug second sample postoperative day five . Thus liver transplant patient total 15 milliliter ( mL ) blood period 5 day collect study . The administration immunosuppression drug dosage alter component research study . A tissue sample liver donor organ also take culture MCSs ( exempt inform consent ) . Control group patient undergo liver resection . They receive dose methylprednisolone . Intra-operatively blood sample collect time point : - immediately arterial line placement - two hour liver resection . Postoperatively two additional 3-mL blood sample take . The first take postoperative day one second postoperative day five day discharge whichever come sooner . These sample collect study team member . A total 12mL blood period 5 day collect liver resection patient study purpose . All blood sample immediately deliver Dr. Rameswhar 's lab , locate MSB , E579 . The relative frequency MSCs present blood two group assess flow cytometry . The data present percentage MSCs/106 mononuclear cell . Statistical analysis perform determine difference two group subject . In addition study donor liver , also treat liver cell glucocorticoid examine liver change aquaporin . The reason modification determine aquaporin increase ability accumulate water . This additional study change sample since small ( &lt; 1mg ) tissue sufficient .</detailed_description>
