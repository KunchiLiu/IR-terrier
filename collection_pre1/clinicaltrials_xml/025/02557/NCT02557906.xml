	<brief_summary>Some woman breast cancer whole breast remove part treatment ( mastectomy ) . Of woman , around 31 % surgery create new breast.There two main way create new breast ( ) use tissue elsewhere body ( `` autologous '' reconstruction ) ( ii ) use silicone implant . In recent year , report use material call `` acellular dermal matrix '' ( ADM ) result breast reconstruction surgery use implant improve . ADMs material originally come animal human skin . They act like sling , support low part implant beneath skin . Although ADMs approve use breast reconstruction safe , little high quality evidence back report benefit , study suggest use may fact increase complication . The main purpose study find actual risk benefit use ADM breast reconstruction surgery . The investigator follow progress woman implant base reconstruction observe participant develop problem ; problem participant feel result surgery . The investigator also follow progress woman undergo autologous reconstruction alternative reconstructive technique use implant reason .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluating Outcomes Immediate Breast Reconstruction ( POBRAD-M )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite widespread adoption acellular dermal matrix ( ADMs ) breast reconstruction , limited prospective high quality evidence outcome use . The majority study ADM poor quality retrospective cohort study ill-defined , non-standardised outcome measure heterogeneous patient population . Recent systematic review raise concern increase infection seroma rate associate ADM use , correct , may negate report advantage . Furthermore little high quality evidence confirm benefit associate use improve aesthetic outcome . The POBRAD-M prospective , multicentre trial evaluate early late outcome immediate breast reconstruction use either implant ADM , autologous tissue alternative implant-based technique . All participant must deem suitable outset implant base reconstruction ADM irrespective final procedure choice . All participant follow 30 day , 3 month 12 month record incidence complication ( include implant loss , infection , seroma , haematoma skin necrosis ) . Additionally Patient Reported Outcomes measure use BREAST-Q questionnaire determine 30 day 12 month , aesthetic outcome determine panel assessment post-operative photograph 12 month post-operatively .</detailed_description>
