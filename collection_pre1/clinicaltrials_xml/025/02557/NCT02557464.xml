	<brief_title>Identification Early Markers Alzheimer 's Disease Using Eye Tracking Reading .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Scientific background : Identifying Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) early possible enable propose re-education platform would fit early stage neuronal loss pathology . Neuropsychological evaluation currently one main tool early screen AD . Among test propose evaluation , investigator find Isaacs Set Test evaluate early degradation semantic memory . Whereas eye movement behavior read sensitive semantics factor allow collect accurate measurement ( precisely one millisecond ) , study yet use technique precisely identify precocious semantics trouble AD . Goal : The objective study identify early accurate marker AD associate semantic neuropsychological assessment eye track sentence read . Method : The study include 24 patient AD related disorder ( Mini Mental State Examination 20 27 ) 24 age match control participant . The experiment divide two step . First , patient take standard neuropsychological evaluation . A specific semantic analysis perform participant use , example , Isaacs Set Test Weschler Similarities . The second step ask participant read sentence eye tracker ( Eye Link 1000 remote ) record eye movement . In order manipulate semantics factor , sentence contain target word , either predictable . The experiment last one hour half . Neuropsychological assessment eye track do twice time interval 6 month . The two time call T1 T2 require estimate whether eye track good predictor AD neuropsychological test . Evaluation criterion : The eye track technique enables record different sort measure . More specifically , investigator evaluate gaze duration target word . Moreover , neuropsychological test score collect . It , example , number good answer . Hypothesis expect result : First , investigator expect predictability effect eye movement would less pronounced patient AD related disorder control group . This effect would even diminish T2 . It could explain progressive degradation semantic memory patient . Then , reason , investigator expect score collect neuropsychological test would pathological patient suffer AD related disorder . The test score would even deficit T2 . Finally , investigator predict correlation neuropsychological test data eye movement data . With extrapolation , eye movement record allow u obtain accurate information quality semantic process , investigator formulate hypothesis technique help predict early AD .</detailed_description>
