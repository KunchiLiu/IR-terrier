	<criteria>Age 140 year Histologically confirm malignant extracranial solid tumor The subject 's tumor must relapse failed respond frontline therapy must know curative therapy available . Subject must life expectancy &gt; 8 week Karnofsky performance status &gt; 50 % patient &gt; 16 year age , Lansky performance status &gt; 50 % patient &lt; 16 year age . The subject must least 1 measurable target lesion &gt; 10mm long dimension anatomic location treatable MRHIFU . Note study , lesion bone WILL consider measurable provide meet criterion RECIST confirm metabolically active baseline study either MIBG uptake ( neuroblastoma ) PET avidity . Target lesion locate adequately heated hyperthermia treatment cell diameter 58 mm , center depth 35 80 mm skin . There staple , implant , extensive scarring , highly ultrasound absorb reflect tissue expect beam path . For first 5 patient enrol study , lesion must locate extremity pelvis consider treatable MRHIFU . The subject must recover acute toxic effect prior therapy exception alopecia .

Signed write informed consent must obtain prior study procedure . Subjects may receive investigational agent anticancer therapy . Subjects know active brain metastasis exclude clinical trial . Patients brain metastasis treat stable &gt; 30 day follow treatment eligible . Subjects receive prior Doxil progress therapy eligible , subject may receive prior doxorubicin . Subjects history tumor progression within 30 day anthracycline administration eligible . However , subject previously receive anthracycline subsequently relapse great 30 day recent prior dose anthracycline eligible . History allergic reaction attribute doxorubicin Doxil Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement .
