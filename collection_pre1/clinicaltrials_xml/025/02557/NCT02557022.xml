	<detailed_description>Background : Obesity overweight identify risk factor develop type 2 diabetes , dyslipidemia , hypertension , CVD certain cancer . Nutrition therapy first line treatment prevention health condition key component initial long term management . Diets base low GI food low GL associate risk reduction type 2 diabetes CVD . Current clinical practice guideline suggest replacement high GI food low GI food base improvement glycemic control CVD risk factor . However , enough evidence support association low GI/GL diet body weight reduction . Need review : The lack high quality data area support clinical practice guideline represent urgent call strong evidence . The use meta-analyses control feeding trial remain `` Goal Standard '' evidence nutrition guideline development . Objectives : To provide evidence-based guidance public health policy , health claim , nutrition guideline relate low GI/GL diet , conduct systematic review meta-analysis control feeding trial assess effect low GI/GL diet body weight . Design : The planning conduct propose meta-analyses follow Cochrane handbook systematic review intervention . The reporting follow Preferred Reporting Items Systematic review Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) guideline . Data source : MEDLINE , EMBASE The Cochrane Central Register Controlled Trials search use appropriate search term . Study selection : Intervention trial investigate effect low GI/GL diet body weight human include . Studies less 12 week diet duration , control group , include pregnant woman , breast feeding woman child , report body weight data exclude . Data extraction : Two independent investigator extract information study design , sample size , subject characteristic , GI/GL diet , follow-up , composition background diet . Mean Â± SEM value extract outcomes . Standard computation imputation use derive miss data . Risk bias assess use Cochrane Collaboration risk bias tool . Outcome : The primary outcome body weight . Data synthesis : Pooled analysis conduct use Generic Inverse Variance method random effect model stratify metabolic phenotype ( normal weight , overweight/obese , metabolic syndrome criterion , diabetes , etc. ) . Random-effects model use even absence statistically significant between-study heterogeneity , yield conservative summary effect estimate presence residual heterogeneity . Paired analyse apply crossover trial . Heterogeneity test Cochran Q statistic quantify I2 statistic . Sources heterogeneity explore sensitivity subgroup analyse . A priori subgroup analysis include GI/GL ( absolute level , within-treatment change , between-treatment change ) , comparator ( high GI diet , ) , duration follow-up , saturate fat intake ( absolute level , within-treatment change , between-treatment change ) , dietary fibre intake ( absolute level , within-treatment change , between-treatment change ) , total carbohydrate intake ( absolute level , within-treatment change , between-treatment change ) , design ( crossover , parallel ) , risk bias , median baseline body weight . Meta-regression analysis assess significance categorical continuous subgroup analysis . Publication bias investigate inspection funnel plot application Egger Begg test . Evidence Assessment : The strength evidence outcome assess use Grading Recommendations Assessment , Development Evaluation ( GRADE ) . Knowledge translation plan : Results disseminate traditional mean interactive presentation local , national , international scientific meeting publication high impact factor journal . Innovative mean webcasts e-mail feedback mechanism also use . Knowledge Users act knowledge broker network among opinion leader different adopter group increase awareness stage . Four Knowledge Users also participate directly member nutrition guideline committee . Target adopter include clinical practice , public health , industry , research community , patient group . Feedback incorporate use guide analyse improve key message stage . Preliminary finding : We conduct systematic review meta-analysis effect dietary pulse glycemic control 41 control feeding trial . We find pulse alone low GI high-fibre diet improve marker glycemic control . Although improvement clinically significant , come expense substantial inter-study heterogeneity . We also conduct systematic review meta-analysis prospective cohort association GI GL coronary heart disease event . We find high GI GL diet significantly associate coronary heart disease event woman men . Knowledge translation project already begin . These data provide rationale large trial effect low GI diet type 2 diabetes address identify source heterogeneity , well rationale trial effect lower GL canola oil glycemic control cardiovascular risk factor . These data also use development 2013 CDA Clinical Practice Guidelines ( CPG ) Nutrition Therapy . Significance : The propose project aid knowledge translation relate effect low GI/GL diet body weight , strengthen evidence-base dietary recommendation health claim . It improve health outcome inform healthcare provider patient , stimulate industry innovation , guide future research .</detailed_description>
