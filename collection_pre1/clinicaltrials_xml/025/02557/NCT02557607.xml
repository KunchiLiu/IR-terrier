	<brief_title>Quantification Cerebral Blood Flow Arterial Spin Labeling Vasospasm Subarachnoid Haemorrhage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The subarachnoid hemorrhage ( SAH ) relatively severe disease whose prognosis particularly relate early onset arterial vasospasm , maximum 5th 14th day SAH . Many obstacle make difficult screen monitoring complication . The challenge able demonstrate reduction regional cerebral blood flow onset irreversible parenchymal sequela , responsible majority long-term morbidity among survivor . In clinical routine , screen vasospasm achieve Doppler intracranial artery ( DTC ) . However , sensitivity poor regard middle anterior cerebral artery . The gold standard diagnosis cerebral arteriography . However , vasospasm arteriography trans-cranial Doppler prejudice appearance delay ischemic deficit . A technique MRI infusion -l'Arterial Spin Labeling- , non-invasive non-irradiating , repeatable time , appear promising field . This sequence allow routine , generate perfusion map relate entire brain volume</detailed_description>
