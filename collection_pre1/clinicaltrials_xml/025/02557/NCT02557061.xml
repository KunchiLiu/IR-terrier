	<brief_summary>Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) one common cancer France ( 36,000 new case / year ) nearly 16,000 people die year disease . The lymph node involvement surgical specimen today main tool base adjuvant treatment decision curative surgical resection . The study new predictive factor identify patient risk develop local metastatic recurrence therefore major challenge . It clear immune system play role control tumor 's development , show correlation presence CD3+ T-lymphocyte infiltrate colorectal cancer patient survival . Preliminary study suggest important role regulatory T-lymphocyte modulation antitumor immune response . The aim study follow cohort patient operate colon cancer curative intent highlight prognostic characteristic tumoral infiltrate various lymphocyte population ( particularly T-lymphocytes also B-lymphocytes regulatory lymphocyte ) . It perform preoperative analysis blood circulate lymphocyte antibody specific different cell population ( CD3 , CD4 , CD8 , CD56 , CD16 , CD19 , CD2 ) stage activation ( CD25 , CD69 , HLA-DR ) differentiation ( CD24 , CD38 , CD27 , CD103 , CD62L , CCR7 , CD45RA / RO , IgD ) . The presence regulatory T-lymphocytes also analyze . It perform tumor sample Tissue Microarrays immunohistochemical study determine presence different lymphocyte population . We systematically study marker CD68 ( monocytes / macrophage ) , CD56 ( NK cell ) , CD20 CD79a ( B cell / plasma cell ) , CD3 ( T cell ) , CD8 ( cytotoxic T ) , CD4 ( helper T ) FoxP3 ( regulatory T ) , cytotoxicity CD8 marker ( Fas ligand , perforin granzyme ) MHC I ( antigen presentation ) explore innate adaptive immune response . For section , different zone analyze ( center invasive margin healthy tissue ) . The main objective study influence tumor infiltration rate CD3 + T cell disease free survival 2-years patient non-metastatic colon cancer resection . The secondary objective search correlation rate T-lymphocytes preoperative blood sample tumor sample .</brief_summary>
