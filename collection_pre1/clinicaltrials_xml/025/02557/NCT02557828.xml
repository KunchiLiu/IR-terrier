	<brief_summary>Invasive blood pressure monitoring achieve cannulating artery transducing pressure . During arterial cannulation artery locate palpation , use ultrasound increase success rate cannulation . A new ultrasound technique vascular cannulation ( dynamic needle tip position ) describe . We aim compare technique palpation technique arterial cannulation . We hypothesize use novel ultrasound technique result high first attempt success rate overall success compare palpation . We plan enroll 310 patient study . The participant study deem attending anesthesiologist require radial arterial line operation thus research protocol involve deviation standard care .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Target Sign vs Palpation Radial Arterial Line Placement</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants bring main operating room . The patient require anything different enrol study . The anesthesiologist ask confirm patient still require arterial line . The patient randomize either palpation ultrasound group . Patients would place supine position operate room table regular monitor ( electrocardiogram , pulse oximeter , non-invasive blood pressure ) apply . After preoxygenation , patient would induce airway secure . For require arterial catheter induction general anesthesia , subcutaneous lidocaine use anesthetize planned puncture site . The arm would abduct decision side place arterial line determine operator palpation scan wrist ultrasound . An ultrasound image radial artery cannulate obtain . A wrist roll would place wrist hand secure tape . The wrist would prepped chlorhexidine sterile towel place around prepped site . Timing would begin ultrasound operator finger touch prepped wrist . For randomized ultrasound , Sonosite linear ultrasound probe would use locate radial artery . After satisfactory position obtain , 20 ga angiocath 45mm long would use puncture artery would advance tip appear ultrasound view . When happen ultrasound advanced 2mm proximal along artery . The needle advanced tip visualize . This repeat needle tip lumen radial artery . At point needle sequentially advanced lumen artery small step ultrasound vision cannula advance needle . The needle core retract transducer connect cannula . If first attempt unsuccessful , attempt may make 5 minute elapse . Success define arterial cannulation show arterial waveform obtain within 5 minute touch prepped skin ultrasound probe operator finger . After operator may use arterial cannulation method choice decide change wrist . For palpation method , radial artery would palpate 20 ga angiocath use puncture artery . After return blood catheter attempt make advance catheter needle core . If successful , operator make multiple attempt 5 minute elapse . After time , operator use desire method cannulate artery may also decide use wrist . We record successful first pas cannulation , time cannulate vessel . Other measure number attempt , number catheter , radial artery depth , radial artery diameter , blood pressure , heart rate , failure rate . Other data record include patient age , gender , weight , height , body mass index , history peripheral vascular disease , diabetes . Patients require followup study .</detailed_description>
