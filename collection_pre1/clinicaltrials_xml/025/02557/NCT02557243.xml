	<brief_title>Malignant Pediatric Soft Tissue &amp; Bone Tumors Extremities : A Retrospective Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Sarcomas heterogeneous group rare tumor arise predominantly embryonic mesoderm . The various sarcoma include bone sarcoma ( osteosarcomas chondrosarcoma ) , Ewing 's sarcoma , peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumor , soft tissue sarcoma . Soft tissue sarcoma account approximately 1 % adult malignancy 7 % 15 % pediatric malignancy . Rhabdomyosarcoma common soft tissue sarcoma childhood . There confusion within segment medical community precise mean `` soft tissue . '' The soft tissue human body include extraskeletal tissue neither epithelial , hematopoietic ( marrow derive blood element ) , parenchymal ( constituent visceral organ ) . The nervous system divide neither glial central neuronal element consider soft tissue , though convention peripheral nervous system . In sum , soft tissue consist adipose tissue , fibrous tissue , musculature , vascular structure , peripheral nerve . About 50 % 60 % sarcoma occur extremity , although rare , responsible death testicular cancer , Hodgkin 's disease , thyroid cancer combine . Patients &amp; Methods : From January 2000 till December 2015 , retrieval &amp; analysis medical record pediatric patient soft tissue &amp; bone tumor involve extremity make pediatric oncology department , South Egypt Cancer Institute represent large referral center Upper Egypt . These data categorize accord demographic characteristic , clinico-pathologic feature , treatment modality receive , outcome treatment patient .</detailed_description>
