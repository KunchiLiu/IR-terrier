	<brief_summary>This study aim document early change distal gut microbiota ( fecal mucosa-associated ) post FMT . Furthermore , whole blood urine sample facilitate collaborative immunologic metabolomic analysis . This open label clinical trial FMT prevent recurrence patient suffer least third episode Clostridium difficile infection ( CDI ) previously treat oral vancomycin .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The exact mechanism FMT effective presently unknown . A recent study 14 patient recurrent CDI treat FMT35 show decreased diversity pre-FMT gut microbiota become diverse similar donor post-FMT . This group show significant change 3 taxonomic order single organism specie universally associate success . Weingarden et al . show FMT restore normal bile acid composition patient recurrent CDI36 , suggest correction bile acid metabolism likely major mechanism FMT result cure prevent recurrence CDI . Understanding mechanisms FMT completely may enable development synthetic microbiota-based therapeutic would safe effective alternative traditional FMT . We hypothesize early change distal gut microbiota post-FMT may help identify key specie associate efficacy . Furthermore , believe measurable metabolic immunologic effect may also beneficial FMT . This study aim document early change distal gut microbiota ( fecal mucosa-associated ) post FMT . Furthermore , whole blood urine sample facilitate collaborative immunologic metabolomic analysis . This open label clinical trial FMT prevent recurrence patient suffer least third episode Clostridium difficile infection ( CDI ) previously treat oral vancomycin . Subjects consist 6 adult outpatient refer 3 ( ) episodes CDI . Subjects , treat least 10 day course anti-CDI therapy ( metronidazole , vancomycin fidaxomicin ) recent acute infection , receive FMT donor stool administer time sigmoidoscopy . After procedure , subject follow 8 week C. difficile recurrence . Subjects relapse period offer repeat FMT use donor stool . We plan collect baseline post-FMT stool sample microbiome analysis well sample urine blood metabolomic immunologic study . Subjects contact 24 week assess long term safety outcome</detailed_description>
