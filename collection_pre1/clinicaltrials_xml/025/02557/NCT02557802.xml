	<brief_summary>The investigator explore experimental medicine healthy human model immunisation , whether switch route sequential administration license influenza vaccine result immune response broad ability recognise different substrains influenza virus . The investigator initially give immunisation nasal injected vaccine , switch subject receive second dose one month later ( cellular component immunity mature ) via opposite route ( nasal- &gt; inject injected- &gt; nasal ) . The investigator use research assay map different part influenza virus vaccinate person 's immune cell recognise baseline , first immunisation , second , see breadth recognition broaden include new strain virus component . Should pilot study give indication breadth widen ( rather boost response see first immunisation ) provide justification large study statistical significance may power observed change . The study fund ADITEC , collaborative research programme aim accelerate development novel powerful immunisation technology next generation human vaccine .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study Open-label , randomise , exploratory , hypothesis generate study . Each participant participate study approximately two month . Recruitment aim begin , receipt favourable opinion ethic committee , October/ November 2015 , flu season . There three outpatient visit study : Visit 1 screen immunisation , Visit 2 immunisation , Visit 3 outpatient follow-up . All visit take place Surrey Clinical Research Centre . Written inform consent obtain participant informed nature , significance , implication risk study prior commencement study specific procedure . There two immunisation participant : one Day 0 ( visit 1 ) Day 28 ( visit 2 ) . After screen participant randomise one two treatment group ( n=15 group ) receive dose vaccine recommend dose level , accord Summary Product Characteristics , follow order : Group A : Intranasal spray day 0 follow intramuscular injection day 28 Group B : Intramuscular injection day 0 follow intranasal spray day 28 Visit 1 ( Day 0 ) : At visit inform consent obtain , demographic data medical history record . Concomitant medication review symptoms-directed physical examination take place . Heart rate , blood pressure oral temperature also record . A pregnancy test ( urine ) conduct indicate . Participants assess inclusion exclusion criterion . At point participant eligible randomise group A B . Blood sample take serum PBMC give immunisation either nasal spray intramuscular injection depend group . Immunisation postpone person suffer acute illness oral temperature ≥38.0°C day immunisation symptom resolve , oral temperature &lt; 38°C . Subsequent visit delay duration . Visit 2 ( Day 28 ) : At visit two , medical history update review concomitant medication . A symptoms-directed physical examination also take place . Heart rate , blood pressure oral temperature also record . A pregnancy test ( urine ) conduct indicate . Participants assess inclusion exclusion criterion . Blood sample take serum PBMC give immunisation either nasal spray intramuscular injection depend group Immunisation postpone person suffer acute illness oral temperature ≥38.0°C day immunisation symptom resolve , oral temperature &lt; 38°C . A visit window -3 day +7 day acceptable Visit 2 avoid wherever possible use situation sample would otherwise lose . Visit 3 reschedule maintain 28 day visit . Visit 3 ( Day 56 ) : At visit 3 review concomitant medication blood sample take serum PBMC . A visit window -3 +14 day acceptable Visit 3 avoid wherever possible use situation sample would otherwise lose . If participant attend within window sample collect early date possible AFTER expect visit window . These sample may test per protocol .</detailed_description>
