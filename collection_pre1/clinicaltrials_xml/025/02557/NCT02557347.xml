	<brief_title>Fluid Overload Peritoneal Dialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Fluid overload common problem peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) patient associate leave ventricular hypertrophy adverse cardiac consequence . Fluid management therefore important aspect management dialysis patient . In Hong Kong , PD patient common medical problem relate dialysis assess manage renal nurse clinic pre-approved intervention protocol . Although general impression management PD patient fluid overload nurse-lead intervention protocol robust could reduce work load medical staff , efficacy approach remain undetermined . The objective study determine effectiveness treat PD patient fluid overload structure nurse-lead intervention protocol . We plan recruit 100 PD patient fluid overload , define overhydration ( OH ) ≥ 2 litre measure bioimpedance spectroscopy . These patient assess manage renal nurse specialist ambulatory renal center accord standardize protocol previously approve Hospital Authority . The improvement degree overhydration determine bioimpedance spectroscopy 4 12 week treatment . Change body weight , blood pressure , degree oedema , well knowledge salt fluid restriction also assess .</detailed_description>
