	<brief_summary>AMD disease central retina , zone enables fine detail activity ( reading , detail… ) . This central zone retina affect haemorrhagic complication small abnormal vessel suddenly start bleed inside retina . Several therapeutic approach currently available even though never truly compare . The study propose patient need treat haemorrhage macula . A certain number factor evaluate compare 2 principal approach currently use France : surgery follow injection anti-angiogenic OR intravitreal injection gas follow injection anti-angiogenics . This multicentre , randomize control trial compare 2 therapeutic approach . These diametrically opposed approach different consequence patient term cost society . The consequence patient immediately measurable determine best therapeutic approach term functional recovery impact disease quality life , take account risk inherent 2 treatment . The impact quality life 2 approach well consequence - important factor disease , cause sensory handicap - provide ophthalmological community essential information make possible validate one method management haematoma .</brief_summary>
