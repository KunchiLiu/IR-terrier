	<brief_title>Early Cholecystectomy Patients With Mild Gallstone Acute Pancreatitis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute pancreatitis prevalent disease , responsible 220.000 hospital admission per year USA . In Chile , year 2012 76.463 hospital admission diagnosis , mean hospital stay 11,8 day 25 death per year associate disease ( 250 death 2002 2012 ) . The frequent etiology pancreatitis Chile gallstone , present 80 % patient admit acute pancreatitis . This explain high prevalence gallstone among patient . Since Acosta Ledesma demonstrate association gallstone acute pancreatitis 1974 , cholecystectomy efficient treatment option prevent recurrence reach even 30-40 % first two week first episode . There consensus delaying time cholecystectomy patient acute gallstone pancreatitis mortality high 80 % patient present severe case . However , vast majority patient present mild pancreatitis require basic medical support . In patient , role surgery hospital admission clearly demonstrate . There current consensus respect safety perform cholecystectomy patient mild pancreatitis within 48 72 hour hospital admission . There well-designed observational study one randomize clinical trial , demonstrate significant decrease hospital stay ( 7 4 day ) , without increase rate complication mortality . According model analysis decision , strategy could reduce cost associate prolonged hospital stay improve quality life patient without jeopardize patient safety .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adults include age 18 70 mild gallstone pancreatitis . A subject classified gallstone pancreatitis meet two following : ( accord Atlanta Consensus review 2012 ) 1. abdominal pain consistent acute pancreatitis ( acute onset persistent , severe , epigastric pain often radiate back ) ; 2. serum lipase activity ( amylase activity ) least three time great upper limit normal ; 3. characteristic finding acute pancreatitis contrastenhanced compute tomography less commonly magnetic resonance image transabdominal ultrasonography . The classification Mild pancreatitis : ( accord Atlanta Consensus review 2012 ) 1. absence organ failure ( absence SIRS Score Marshall &lt; 2 ) 2. absence local ( pancreatic peri pancreatic change compute tomography ) systemic complication ( exacerbation preexist comorbidity ) Imaging confirmation gallstone biliary sludge . Ethanol abuse Acute cholangitis ( defined temperature &gt; 38.6Â°C , right upper quadrant pain tenderness , significant hyperbilirubinemia ) Moderate Severe acute pancreatitis ( accord Atlanta Consensus review 2012 ) Prior diagnosis choledocholithiasis Prior gastric bypass surgery Prior open supraumbilical surgery Patient refusal participate Severe preexist medical comorbidities contraindicate cholecystectomy Pregnancy Incapacity give inform consent ( mental illness )</criteria>
