	<brief_summary>Iron deficiency anemia pregnancy significant worldwide health problem , affect 22 % pregnant woman industrialize country 52 % non-industrialized country . Iron deficiency anemia pregnancy associate increase maternal well fetal morbidity , include prematurity , low birth-weight perinatal infant loss . Therefore , routine iron supplementation second half pregnancy recommend daily . Others , however , support selective iron supplementation woman iron deficiency anemia , order avoid increase risk haemoconcentration associate routine iron supplementation . Unfortunately , compliance either iron-supplementation program , especially among pregnant woman , poor , due part side effect associate preparation . Currently , many iron preparation available contain different type iron salt , include ferrous sulfate , ferrous fumarate , ferrous ascorbate common adverse drug reaction find preparation mainly gastrointestinal intolerance like nausea , vomit , constipation , diarrhea , abdominal pain , ferrous bis-glycinate ( fully react chelate amino acid form iron ) rarely make complication . Product result reaction metal ion soluble salt amino acid form coordinate covalent bond , result molecule call chelate chemical bonding process call chelation . Ferrous bis-glycinate highly stable totally nutritionally functional chelate amino acid fully react chelate form bind two molecule glycine one Fe2+ atom .</brief_summary>
