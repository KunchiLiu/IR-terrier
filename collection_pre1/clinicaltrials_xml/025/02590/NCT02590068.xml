	<brief_summary>This study aim identify innate adaptive immune response zoster vaccination . Half participant individual chronic hepatitis C , half healthy volunteers.The innate immune signature elicit Zoster vaccination characterize RNA-seq analysis pre- post-vaccination RNA whole blood . We compare fold change gene expression profile pre- versus post-vaccination individual , well two arm study . RNA-seq use assess innate immune activation evaluate change expression level interferon-stimulated gene pre- post-vaccination . Adaptive immune response determine traditional correlate protection use previous Zoster clinical study addition flow cytometry24 . Correlates protection include antibody response , interferon gamma production frequency responder cell post- vaccination24 . For antibody production , perform Zoster glycoprotein ELISA ( gpELISA ) target IgG/IgM . The number frequency responder cell characterize flow cytometry .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic HCV infection associate persistent innate immune activation dampen cellular immune response . Interferons ( IFNs ) key mediator antiviral innate immune response , initiate expression interferon-stimulated gene ( ISG ) numerous host protective effector function . However , chronic HCV , high pre-therapy expression ISG persistent activation innate immune system negatively predict response IFN-based therapy failure viral clearance8 . In addition , HCV persistence also associate HCV-specific-CD8+ T cell exhaustion . HCV-specific CD8+ T cell exhaustion characterize diminished ex vivo polyfunctionality , upregulation negative costimulatory cell modulators , decrease cellular proliferation IFN production10,12 . This phenotype associate development short-term effector CD8+ T cell rather durable , long-term memory CD8+ T cell . Chronic bystander infection ( e.g . chronic HCV ) , characterize persistent inflammation link bystander ( non-HCV specific ) CD8+ T cell dysfunction . Bystander CD8+ T cell dysfunction significantly impairs expansion memory CD8+ T cell could prevent development secondary immunological memory new antigen and/or vaccines11,13 . Clinically , chronic HCV associate impaired immune response Hepatitis B vaccination13,14,15 . Only 40 % 60 % individual chronic HCV achieve seroprotective titer follow HBV vaccination versus 90 % 95 % healthy subjects13,14 . Specific immune defect responsible HBV vaccine failure HCV-infected patient unknown present . However , study suggest blunt immune response HBV vaccination associate lymphocyte dysfunction upregulation PD-1 expression CD4+ T cell HBV vaccine non-responders13,15 . In United States , 99.5 % adult 40 year infect Varicella zoster virus ( VZV ) risk Zoster virus reactivation ( shingle ) complication . Unilateral , painful , blister rash along dermatome characterize shingle . Complications associate shingle include acute chronic pain , osteonecrosis , zoster ophthalmicus visual impairment , increase risk blindness 4-fold risk cerebral vasculitis-associated stroke ) 1,2 . Overall , complication shingle negative impact quality life activity daily living21,22 . Zoster vaccine live ( ZostavaxÂ® , Merck ) recommend prevention shingle . Zoster vaccine live , attenuate vaccine license FDA individual older 50 year without underlie immune deficiency ( HIV , malignancy , immunosuppression transplantation ) . In non-immunocompromised individual , Zoster vaccine decrease shingle 51 % individual age 60 - 89 year 70 % individual 50 - 59 year age . Chronic infection TB , malaria chronic Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) associate increased susceptibility pathogen decrease vaccination efficacy3-6 . Although chronic HCV infection consider clinically immunocompromised state , associate persistent immune activation decrease vaccination response7 . Zostavax routinely administer chronic HCV patient . However , present , study document immune response elicit Zoster vaccination population . This study aim identify innate adaptive immune signature elicit zoster vaccination chronic HCV healthy volunteer . Unrecognized suboptimal vaccine response individual chronic immune dysregulated state ( chronic bystander viral infection ( HBV , HCV HIV CD4 &gt; 200 ) , diabetes , advance age , cancer transplantation ) could potentially devastate costly .</detailed_description>
