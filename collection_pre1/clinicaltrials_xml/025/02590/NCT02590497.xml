	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study correlation genetics brain image patient newly diagnose glioblastoma surgery . The genetic characteristic tumor important way predict well respond treatment . Imaging , use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , take detailed picture organ inside body , may also provide information help doctor predict brain tumor respond treatment . If MRI provide doctor similar information tumor tumor 's gene , may able use predict tumor response patient whose tumor reach surgery biopsy get tissue sample .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine correlation genetic neuroimaging signature glioblastoma . II . Determine correlation neuroimaging signature glioblastoma prognosis . OUTLINE : Patients undergo MRI gadolinium contrast administration , include 3-dimensional ( 3D ) volumetric T1-weighted sequence , fluid attenuate inversion recovery ( FLAIR ) sequence , diffusion weight imaging , perfusion MRI . Tissue sample also analyze tumor genetic profile .</detailed_description>
