	<brief_title>Walnuts , Long-Chain Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Adolescent Brain Development</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Adolescence , important window opportunity vulnerability brain development Although less well study , adolescence also critical period brain development . The brain undergoes important organizational change , re-emergence gonadotropin-releasing hormone trigger cascade hormone dependent process . Other biological process involve epigenetic factor , highly sensitive environment may therefore make period growth vulnerable external insult ( Morrison , 2013 ) . Moreover , prefrontal cortex , carry important function internally guide behavior ( control emotion ) , logical thinking , work memory organize skill ( executive function ) , last region brain mature ( early-twenties ) . The synaptic plasticity prefrontal cortex accentuate adolescence , process involve loss grey matter density , increase white matter volume , cerebral blood flow synaptic pruning . Adolescence also time refinement brain connectivity complex behavior ( Selemon , 2013 ) . It widely recognize synaptic plasticity brain decrease age ( Morrison , 2013 ; Selemon , 2013 ) , pattern seem follow linear trend , adolescence important period brain development enhance protected environmental hazard long-term consequence ( everything air pollution social stress ) . There need great understanding biological pathway environment affect human brain development , particularly adolescence , complex behavior refine adulthood sophistication . Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid , walnut brain development Nutrition pregnancy , lactation , childhood adolescence fundamental influence overall development . Essential fatty acid long chain polyunsaturated acid ( LCPUFAs ) body synthesize , must obtain diet ( mainly oily fish , seed nut ) . Three fatty acid play essential role brain development : omega-3 ( docosahexaenoic ( DHA ) eicosapentaenoic ( EPA ) acid ) omega-6 ( arachidonic acid ( AA ) ) ( McCann , 2005 ) . LCPUFAs comprise approximately 15 30 % brain 's dry weight ( Hallahan , 2005 ) , involve function architecture central nervous system throughout various stage life . Studies show DHA regulate neurotransmission system serotonergic , dopaminergic , norepinephrinergic , acetylcholinergic system ( Fontani , 2005 ) . Of edible plant , walnuts high level omega-3 fatty acid , alpha-linolenic acid ( ALA ) . ALA precursor DHA EPA , two essential fatty acid brain ( Carey , 2013 ) . Walnuts also rich fiber , vitamin , mineral , bioactive substance , phenolic antioxidant phytosterols ( Bao , 2013 ) . Several study confirm increment blood n-3 PUFA level improvement lipid profile short-term intervention walnut per day ( Marangoni , 2007 ; Maranhao , 2011 ) . While human study show cardiovascular benefit walnut intake ( Poulose , 2014 ) , need investigate potential beneficial effect brain development , incipient research adult show positive result cognition , result describe Background section ( Pribis , 2012 ; Sánchez-Villegas , 2011 ) . These finding adult provide proof concept potential brain development benefit walnut , never study among young teenager . This question could investigate use population-based randomize control trial ass whether walnut intake show beneficial effect teenage brain function ( use neuropsychological assessment ) . It ethical feasible recommend facilitate walnut intake ( 30 g/day ; Marangoni , 2007 ; Maranhao , 2011 ) long period time ( e.g . 12 month ; de Ruyter , 2012 ) . A Californian walnut contains ~0.40g n-3 PUFAs ( USDA National Nutrient Database Standard Reference , 2012 ) , walnut ( kernel 30g ) per day would meet recommendation consume least 1g n-3 PUFAs per day ( Food Nutritional Board , Institute Medicine National Academies , US , 2014 ) . Young Spanish adult ( 16-25 year ) eat 10g nut per day average ( Salas , 2013 ) . Sea food also contain high n-3 PUFA concentration , sea food intervention contra-indicated due methylmercury content , important neurotoxic environmental pollutant ( Grandjean , 2014 ) . A limitation use walnut intake less consistent daily pill supplement 1g DHA , although specific food recommendation socially cost-effective would comply wider range people global health context . Neuropsychological behavioral assessment , use repeat measurement Recent experience incorporate neuropsychological assessment cohort study INMA ( Environment Childhood , Guxens , 2012 ) result fruitful exchange knowledge neuropsychologists epidemiologist . Computerized neuropsychological test perform repeated exam sensitive tool study high-order brain function development general population ( Julvez , 2010 ) . Moreover , test show population-based study sensitive effect environmental nutritional determinant ( Julvez , 2013 ) . The investigator build experience efficiently select appropriate range test cover complex neurofunctions rapidly develop adolescence , computer test work memory , executive function , motor speed , visual reasoning , selective sustain attention inhibitory function ( Selemon , 2012 ) . Furthermore , neuropsychological test complement behavioral rating scale aim cover socio-emotional endpoint important early adolescence ( Selemon , 2012 ; Morrison , 2013 ) . The fact evaluate behavioral area ( i.e. , social competence ADHD symptom ) may enrich interpretation finding , , possibly contribute understand intrinsic mechanism . One limitation risk lose outcome consistency select much disperse behavioral area without take account link . The best option careful selection neuropsychological behavioral tool efficiently embrace several area teenage brain development . Only trial n-3 PUFA among adolescent 11 year use computer-based neuropsychological test ( Janssen , 2014 ) . A recent large randomize controlled trial among healthy young adult use computerized cognitive test find reaction time latencies work memory improve 6 month DHA supplementation ( Stonehouse , 2013 ) . A double-blind , placebo-controlled trial among child ADHD ( 7-12 year ) find treatment association , observational data , positive association DHA level computerize test score divide attention ( Milte , 2012 ) report . Large trial measure neuropsychological functioning use repeat computerized test within subject yet carry among healthy young adolescent , require well understand ` normal ' brain development . The specific hypothesis : 1 . Walnut intake intervention six month enhance neuropsychological development among teenager general population . The investigator expect find difference two group ( control/walnut ) intervention . 2 . Walnut intake intervention six month enhance behavioral ( socio-emotional ) development among teenager general population . The investigator expect find difference two group intervention . 3 . Walnut intake intervention six month increase n-3 PUFA availability body measure blood subsample 200 teenager . The investigator expect find difference two group ( 100/100 ) intervention . 4. n-3 PUFA level blood associate brain development . Global Objective The global objective population-based randomize control trial investigate whether intake 30 g walnut kernel ( ~1.5g n-3 PUFA ) per day beneficial brain development among teenager . The combination sophisticated tool assess brain function , computerized neuropsychological test , provide precise data require detect even subtle change brain development result effect nutritional intervention . Further assessment use behavioural rating scale give u wide look potential effect intervention . Specific objectives 1 . Determine effectiveness long-term intervention ( 30g walnut kernel per day 6 month ) enhance neuropsychological development . This project provide new understanding role walnut intake ( surrogate n-3 PUFA intake ) brain development teenager . This important impact global health intervention due affordability intervention diverse societal group . A major goal public health research develop effective , cost-effective feasible health recommendation . 2 . Determine effectiveness long-term intervention ( 30g walnut kernel per day 6 month ) enhance behavioural development . In combination neuropsychological ( cognitive ) development , teenage behavioural ( socio-emotional ) development essential wider assessment brain development . 3 . Investigate effect intervention n-3 PUFA level blood investigate association n-3 PUFA level brain development . The importance rely understand potential biological pathway intervention brain development . Secondary Objectives To assess association diet measure FFQ adolescent neuropsychological function . To assess association lifestyle habit assess general health questionnaire adolescent neuropsychological function . To assess association ambient air pollution estimate LUR model adolescent neuropsychological function . To assess association different behavioral area adolescence . To assess association walnut intervention biomarkers related pathway oxidative stress inflammatory system brain function . These biomarkers relate candidate circulating miRNAs brain panel metabolites 5 different class ( acylcarnitines , amino acid , hexose , phospho- , sphingolipids biogenic amine ) . METHODOLOGY The WALNUTB scientific approach consist ambitious randomized control trial large population-based sample . Sample : The trial include 400 healthy teenager ( 12-15 year old ) Barcelona city ( 1,900,000 inhabitant ) , randomly assign two group ( intervention &amp; control ) follow 6 month ( de Ruyter , 2012 ) two identical series ( intervention ) multimodal assessment brain function , biomarkers n-3 PUFA . Power calculation neuropsychological outcome : Assigning 200 participant intervention control group provide 85 % statistical power detect intervention effect 25 point work memory neuropsychological score ( mean 126 , typical deviation 100 general population ) . The following additional specification assume power calculation : 10 % loss follow-up ; intra-class correlation repeat measure 0.2 ; type-I error 0.05 . WP 1 : The walnut intervention : Design setting : This trial blind due nature intervention . The control group receive intervention , apart general healthy eating recommendation ( intervention group ) follow-up assessment . Recruitment : Nurses recruit teenager ( n=400 ) collaboration 20 high school Barcelona . Implementation Adherence : The investigator perform age- gender-stratified random sample assign subject one two group . All family receive basic guide follow healthy diet order ensure implementation adherence . Families intervention group receive additional instruction encourage adolescent eat 30 g walnut per day 6 month , investigator supply free . The nurse contact family every 3 month short checking-interview administer food frequency questionnaire ( FFQ ) . WP 2 : Fieldwork neuropsychological assessment : The investigator validate standardize computerized test reduce inter-observer variability assessment ensure data record automatically without error . Moreover , self-reported internationally validated psychometrical scale use assess adolescent socio-emotional behaviour . In project , investigator exploit interaction neuropsychologists epidemiologists test range neuropsychological function cover various complex behaviour development adolescence . WP 3 : Study intervention effect role omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid : In order investigate effect intervention , valid measure outcomes necessary ( WP2 ) , valid measure intermediate factor , case plasma n-3 PUFA level . Blood sample collect baseline intervention , centrifuge , plasma sample store -80°C analysis . Statistical Analysis : The follow statistical analysis carry : 1 ) Assess effect intervention ratio n-6 PUFA n-3 PUFA ( n6-n3 ratio ) use linear regression model adjust baseline level . 2 ) Assess effect intervention brain development , use method describe 1 ) ; 3 ) Assess effect n6-n3 ratio brain development baseline , n6-n3 ratio change brain development change baseline follow-up . 4 ) Assess proportion effect intervention brain development mediate n6-n3 ratio change . This proportion calculate compare result model without mediator . Analyses 1 ) , 2 ) 3 ) ( i.e . involve intervention ) base intention-to-treat , i.e . use intervention ( no/yes ) regardless compliance , order estimate effect policy ( i.e . encourage eat 30 g walnut per day ) , rather effect walnut consumption . Time Frame : The investigator expect recruitment design intervention perform pilot first 12 month ( ongoing since January 2015 ) , implement intervention perform follow-up 12-24 month . The baseline final assessment complete 24 month ( investigator include 2015 ) , total duration fieldwork two year third year need perform data analysis .</detailed_description>
