	<brief_summary>The goal propose research observe prevalence establish validity newborn screen method severe combine immunodeficiency ( SCID ) . The assay use developed basis PCR quantification T-cell receptor excision circle ( TRECs ) absent SCID patient , thus correlate disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Neonatal Screening Severe Combined Immunodeficiencies</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Severe combine Immunodeficiencies ( SCID ) group inherit disease immune system characterize profound abnormality B T cell development . Infants SCID require prompt clinical response prevent life threaten infection study show significantly improve survival baby Diagnosed birth result previous family history . SCID follow criterion population base newborn screen since asymptomatic birth fatal within first year life , confirmation disease easy , curative treatment , know early stem cell transplantation improve survival.To show early diagnosis SCID TREC screen assay warrant timely treatment disease avoid life-threatening infection patient . Babies SCID unable fight infection . They become severely ill first month life survive unless immune system restore . SCID treat bone marrow transplant recognize early . We undertake task newborn screen whole region Shanghai , So newborn screen test employ study design diagnose SCID infection occur . Through study , hope confirm prevalence SCID China benefit newborn screen early diagnosis SCID . Quantification TRECs ( T-cell receptor excision circle ) DNA extract Guthrie sample sensitive screen test Specific SCID . TRECs small-circle DNA molecules by-product T cell maturation thymus , number reflect number recently emigrate T-cells thymus . Since infant SCID profound decrease T-lymphocytes matter gene mutation involve , logically number TRECs present blood collect via dry blood spot 1-2 day post delivery SCID baby low compare healthy newborn . The TREC assay include DNA extraction 3 mm punch dry blood specimen 96-well plate format . The extracted DNA undergo Real-time qPCR procedure 7900 HT Fast Real-time PCR System ( ABI ) . The TREC copy number calculate relative standard curve generate serially dilute plasmid contain known number TREC . The investigator propose study perform neonatal screening SCID , population 200,000 baby period three year . The investigator propose study incidence SCID , mortality &amp; rate disability , clinical utility SCID screening demonstrate could result broad benefit individual detect , make screen relatively effort spite low incidence disease .</detailed_description>
