	<brief_summary>This study enroll elderly patient advance non-small cell lung cancer high risk develop chemotherapy toxicity ( side effect ) . Patients receive treatment either platinum-based doublet chemotherapy carboplatin/nab-paclitaxel single agent nab-paclitaxel chemotherapy . Response treatment treatment toxicity compare two treatment group determine best treatment strategy group patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Single Agent Versus Combination Chemotherapy Treat High-risk Elderly With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective trial compare treatment failure-free survival rate high-risk elderly patient , identify geriatric assessment , treat either platinum-based doublet chemotherapy carboplatin/nab-paclitaxel single agent nab-paclitaxel advanced non-small cell lung cancer . Treatment failure-free survival appropriate primary outcome capture excessive toxicity due chemotherapy addition death disease progression . The secondary objective evaluate grade 3-5 toxicity , overall response rate , progression free survival , symptom assessment , overall survival two randomization arm .</detailed_description>
