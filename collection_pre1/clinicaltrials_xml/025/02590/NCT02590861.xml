	<brief_summary>Distal extension Partial Removable Dental Prostheses ( PRDPs ) less stable tooth support PRDPs due progressive resorption alveolar ridge , alters retention support generate alveolar bone height . In addition , long-term wearer suffer progressive alveolar ridge resorption contribute great instability . The loss stability retention PRDP lead difficulty mastication swallowing , movement partial denture . These difficulty force patient self-select food substance softer easy chew possibly create change social eating . Therefore , partial denture poorly retentive impact oral health relate quality life Oral Health Related Quality Life ( OHRQoL ) . The placement dental implant edentulous area transform conventional PRDP Implant Supported PRDP , improve functional capacity partial denture wearer , especially ability comminute harder food substance fruit nut . The purpose study quantitatively measure functional difference patient wear conventional PRDP patient wear implant support PRDPs Oral Health Impact patient wear implant support PRDPs . The hypothesis patient wear implant support PRDPs great functional capacity patient wear conventional PRDPs .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In past decade prediction regard level edentulism , need prosthetic rehabilitation population . Although study estimate decline percentage edentulism , decrease need removable prosthesis , predict offset project 79 % increase population 55 year old , number individual exist prosthesis need new prosthesis maintenance , professional public health responsibility serve population regardless level edentulism . In spite demographic prediction , need prosthodontics service , fix dental prosthesis removable dental prosthesis continue oral health concern , part due age population retain teeth result partial edentulism . Prosthetic rehabilitation replace miss teeth , restore oral function positive impact Oral-Health-Related Quality Life ( OHRQoL ) patient . As population continue age worldwide , U.S. specifically , become increasingly important improve OHRQoL segment population possess removable prosthesis high stability , highly retentive prosthetic service . Traditionally , complete partial removable denture lack retention stability , one recommendation improve function utilize dental implant retain stabilize prosthesis . Although , several investigation evaluate OHRQoL patient wear removable preponderate emphasis study complete denture patient . In addition , OHRQoL study generate patient self-reports , limited evaluation actual oral function compare patient self-reported function . This study use OHIP evaluate OHRQoL patient distal extension partial denture , well , actually measure patient chew ability . This prospective cohort study design gather preliminary data improvement patient satisfaction oral function individual wear distal extension partial denture support small length dental implant . Thirty healthy male female participant age 18 65 treated University Minnesota Dental School , Clinical Research Center . A low partial denture fabricate use routine prosthodontic technique . The participant receive 7 mm X 3.75 mm 8.5 mm X 4.1 mm taper implant , A Locator Abutment use connect denture implant improve retention stability partial denture . The chew ability chew pattern evaluate jaw-tracking device masticatory muscle activity evaluate surface Electromyography ( EMG ) . OHRQoL , chew function , patient satisfaction measure 1 , 2 , 6 , 12-month recall appointment .</detailed_description>
