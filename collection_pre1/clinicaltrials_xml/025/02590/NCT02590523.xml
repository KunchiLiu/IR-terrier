	<brief_summary>The goal study determine safety ( efficacy prevent infection ) sterile-packaged pre-loaded injectable solution vancomycin moxifloxacin certain dosage concentration prepare compound pharmacy use intracamerally time cataract surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intracameral Antibiotic Safety Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Use injectable prophylactic intracameral antibiotic cataract surgery gain popularity worldwide due grow body scientific evidence support use . To date , sterile-packaged antibiotic FDA approval indication . Surgeons use intracameral injectable antibiotic cataract surgery must use exist pharmaceutical off-label and/or rely imprecise sub-sterile compounding pharmacy dispense type medication . Both scenario may pose significant risk patient safety . Description Treatment : Approximately 0.2 mL either pre-loaded sterile vancomycin hydrochloride 1 % solution ( 1 mg/0.1 mL normal saline ) moxifloxacin hydrochloride 0.15 % solution ( 150 Î¼g/0.1 mL normal saline ) inject eye blunt tip 30 gauge cannula small clear corneal incision last step cataract removal procedure . The purpose treatment prophylaxis post-operative infection endophthalmitis . Description Effector Pharmaceuticals/Drugs : Vancomycin hydrophilic glycopeptide antibiotic well study many different form : intravenous injectable , oral tablet even topical eye drop solution . It derive Actinobacteria spp . Moxifloxacin synthetic fourth generation fluoroquinolone , likewise , available many form include intravenous injectable , oral tablet topical eye drop solution . In study , contract compound pharmacy produce two pharmaceutical agent concentration/dosage mention USP 797 guideline . Therapeutic Mode Action : The primary mode action vancomycin inhibition cell wall synthesis gram positive bacteria . The molecule form hydrogen bond terminal amnio acid moiety N-acetylmuramic acid ( NAM ) N-acetylglucosamine ( NAG ) polymer . The disruption polymerization cross-linking NAM-NAG complex undermines structural integrity bacterial organism lead bacteriostasis eventually cell death . The primary mode action moxifloxacin inhibit DNA gyrases , type II topoisomerase topoisomerase IV . These enzyme essential bacterial DNA replication occur .</detailed_description>
