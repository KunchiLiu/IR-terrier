	<brief_title>A Clinical Trial Fruquintinib Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Approximately 90 subject randomize Fruquintinib plus best supportive care placebo plus best supportive care 2:1 ratio . Randomization stratify EGFR ( epidermal growth factor receptor ) gene status : mutant vs. wild type vs. unknown . All subject receive Fruquintinib/placebo consecutive 3 week , follow one-week rest . A treatment cycle consist 4 week . Tumor assessment perform every 4 week first 3 cycle , every 8 week since 4th cycle , disease progression . Further treatment survival follow-up progression record .</detailed_description>
