	<brief_summary>Preliminary result prospective screen trial show Digital Breast Tomosynthesis ( DBT ) sensitive specific conventional digital mammography ( DM ) . However , large randomise control trial ( RCTs ) need confirm promising result . Furthermore , potential side effect DBT screen set properly evaluate . In particular , major concern overdiagnosis consequence ; overdiagnosis refers detection cancer screening , would become clinically apparent woman 's lifetime . This RCT design compare benefit harm DBT population-based screen program conventional DM . The primary outcome parameter difference two test rate advance cancer detect subsequent round interval cancer ( within first two year study screen round ) . Secondary outcome measure diagnostic performance indicator organise breast screening ( i.e , cancer detection rate , recall rate , false positive rate , positive predictive value ) , parameter use cost-effectiveness analysis , pathologic biological characteristic screen-detected cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Tomosynthesis Versus Digital Mammography Population-based Screening Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Design study This trial involve several hospital centre within organise breast screen Italian region Piedmont . An invitation letter participate randomise screen trial compare DBT versus DM mail woman , 46-68 year old , living Piedmont Region , eligible invitation regional mammography screen program . Women attend centre screen consent study randomly allocate either DBT DM arm . Women DM arm screen bilateral , two-views digital mammography examination . Women DBT arm screen bilateral two-views combo mode ( DM DBT image acquire single compression ) . In screen arm , examination independently read two expert screen radiologist . In DBT arm , read randomly allocate ( per-case basis ) one three mode : DM plus DBT ( DBT read initial DM interpretation ) , DBT plus DM ( DM read DBT interpretation ) `` concurrent mode '' ( DBT DM read simultaneously ) . In screen arm , participant recall examination indicate least one radiologist ( without consensus arbitration ) . At subsequent round participant invite DM . Interval cancer advance cancer screen-detected next round record . Pathological biological parameter screen-detected cancer ( e.g , stage , grade , hormone receptor , HER2 ) screen arm measure investigate overdiagnosis . With sample size 23,000 69,000 woman DBT DM arm respectively , investigator able observe significant decrease interval cancer advance cancer rate least 50 % ( power 80 % , two tail ) . The collect data also use perform analysis radiological work-flow workload , cost-outcome cost-effectiveness .</detailed_description>
