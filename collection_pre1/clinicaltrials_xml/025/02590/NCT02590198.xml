	<brief_summary>Neonatal bacterial infection remain serious pathology industrialize country despite use prophylaxis measure group B streptococcus ( GBS ) ( peri-partum antibiotic woman GBS colonization ) , implement United States 1996 France 2001 lead dramatic decrease incidence neonatal bacterial infection . However , early onset neonatal infection ( EONI ) , define infection occur first 6 day birth ( oppose late onset neonatal infection ( LONI ) occur day 7-89 ) , still one leading cause neonatal morbidity mortality . Physicians consider EONI significant diagnostic therapeutic emergency due potential sudden onset rapid evolution sepsis newborns immature immune system . Currently , France , detection EONI base national consensus guideline publish 2002 ( ANAES recommendation ) . There broad indication provide empirical antibiotic treatment pending diagnostic confirmation different complementary exam . To ensure every infected newborn diagnose , biological assessment often repeat result use invasive painful procedure , anemia financial concern . Moreover , case abnormal biological result , many newborn subject intravenous ( IV ) antibiotic treatment require hospitalization separation mother . However recent study show antibiotic potentially deleterious effect neonatal digestive microbiota result appearance antibiotic-resistant bacteria , possible long-term consequence health child . Procalcitonin ( PCT ) calcitonin prohormone secrete parenchymal tissue . This marker inflammation show valuable diagnostic marker bacterial infection adult child . It also seem reliable marker neonatal bacterial infection , would make useful detection EONI . Because physiological level PCT vary first day life , possibly due postnatal intestinal bacterial colonization , level marker difficult interpret early neonatal period . However , study 2151 newborn suspect EONI , Nicolas Joram et al . find PCT obtain umbilical blood cord , prior newborn intestinal colonization , bypass postnatal physiological peak PCT effectively constitute discriminant marker distinguish infect healthy infant use cutoff value 0.6 ng/ml . Subsequent pilot study , several study PCT umbilical blood cord confirm good diagnostic performance EONI , particularly include diagnostic algorithm . This marker could contribute good estimation EONI risk order limit use unnecessary complementary exam prescription antibiotic associate short- long-term side effect healthy newborn . Therefore , study , investigator propose test diagnostic value PCT-based algorithm newborn suspect EONI . The investigator hypothesize algorithm efficient currently use ( ANAES ) , limit coincide biological exam exposure antibiotic neonatal period .</brief_summary>
