	<brief_summary>There epidemic type 2 diabetes young adult . These patient high lifetime risk heart-related complication . Subtle heart abnormalities present even young age patient may predispose heart failure ultimately premature death . There emerge evidence type 2 diabetes reverse weight loss . We propose weight loss also reverse fatty change see liver heart patient , turn lead improve heart function . This project aim identify type 2 diabetes cause change heart young people type 2 diabetes perform detailed scan test heart 's structure function . In addition attempt see heart 's pump function improve , either weight loss program special low calorie diet , structure program exercise . This compare usual standard diabetes care . As well look see heart 's function improve intervention , also aim identify mechanism improvement would . We suspect change amount fat within liver heart may responsible , measure beginning , end patient halfway study explore possible mechanism amongst clinical variable ( e.g . HbA1c )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single centre study , comprise cross-sectional analysis baseline data 3-arm 12 week Prospective , Randomised , Open label , Blinded End point ( PROBE ) trial TDR exercise programme compare standard care . Clinical follow-up take place 6-12 month . The trial two primary objective : 1 ) Identify determinants diastolic dysfunction , assess MRI , young adult T2DM multivariate analysis baseline dataset ( cross-sectional study analysis ) 2 ) Determine diastolic dysfunction ( classify diastolic strain rate ) reverse either TDR exercise programme ( PROBE trial ) Secondary objective include : 1 . Determine reference range diastolic strain rate healthy adult 2 . Determine optimum field strength assessment PEDSR - Sample size : Cross-sectional Analysis : A sample size 100 T2DM participant approximately 80 % power test 10 variable multivariate regression analysis , estimate combine R2 15 % , identification determinant diastolic stain rate . - PROBE Trial : All participant Phase I agree take part Phase II randomize . The Investigators expect , base experience previous study , attrition rate 10 % follow first data collection session . Therefore , approximately 90 participant expect randomized three arm ( approximately 30/group ) . The power calculation base Investigators pilot MRC study . The T2DM patient diastolic strain rate 1.5s-1 standard deviation 0.2 s-1 . Based , 30 patient per group 80 % power detect group difference peak early diastolic strain rate ( PEDSR ) 0.2s-1 assume alpha=0.025 ( allow two primary comparison , i.e . TDR vs standard care exercise v standard care ) maximum 30 % drop-out . Such improvement would result strain rate ( 1.7 s-1 ) similar see obese control ( 1.8 s-1 ) still low lean control ( 2.0 s-1 ) . - Randomization : Randomization stratify sex , give different leave ventricular remodel process male female , baseline glucose lower therapy ( GLP-1 , DPP-IV SGLT-2 v none ) . The statistician undertaking final analysis blind treatment group . - Healthy control : Twenty healthy control recruit undertake baseline measure . This population serve confirm normal range relevant scanner inform cross-sectional analysis baseline data provide comparator group study endpoint i.e . determine intervention cause reversion normal diastolic function T2DM population . - Test Re-Test MRI sub-study : An optional sub-study examine test-retest reproducibility MRS 1.5 3T perform select participant willing undergo second scan . Details sub-study provide . As outlined preferred field strength assessment PEDSR 1.5T . However , due high signal noise 3T imaging , MRS myocardial triglyceride may better 3T direct comparison . Participants enrol main study ask would willing take part reproducibility sub-study , ten participant recruit . These participant undertake additional 20 minute scan 3T platform ass myocardial triglyceride PEDSR . The 3T scan consist localisers , cine long axis 4 chamber , 3 chamber short axis mid calculation myocardial strain rate previously describe , follow single voxel H+ MRS interventricular septum allow calculation myocardial triglyceride content . No contrast administer examination . - Statistical Analysis : Cross-sectional Analysis : The aim analyse identify determinant diastolic dysfunction individual T2DM . Outcome potential explanatory variable summarize use mean ( standard deviation ) normally distribute continuous variable , median ( interquartile range ) non-normally distribute continuous variable , count ( percentage ) categorical variable . We anticipate include follow potential explanatory variable : duration diabetes , age , sex , myocardial liver triglyceride content , myocardial perfusion reserve , blood pressure , HBA1c , blood pressure myocardial extracellular volume . Univariate linear regression model fit diastolic strain rate outcome , explanatory variable consideration covariate turn identify factor associate diastolic strain rate . Variables significant univariate association diastolic strain rate enter multivariate regression analysis determine independent association diastolic strain rate . Redundant variable remove stepwise manner , base significance level 0.05 . - PROBE trial/Phase II : The aim analyse compare primary outcome ( diastolic strain rate ) 12 week TDR standard care arm , exercise standard care arm . The primary analysis per protocol analysis proof principle study primarily interested size treatment effect , rather practicability intervention . A CONSORT diagram produce . At baseline follow-up , outcome descriptive variable summarize arm use mean ( standard deviation ) normally distribute continuous variable , median ( interquartile range ) non-normally distribute continuous variable , count ( percentage ) categorical variable . Each intervention compare control group ( i.e . TDR v standard care Exercise v standard care ) use linear regression allow miss outcome data impute use multiple imputation method . If necessary , outcome variable appropriately transformed assumption linear regression model hold . - Healthy control : The aim analyse quantify diastolic strain rate healthy individual currently unknown . These analysis provide context interpret result PROBE trial , power formal comparison T2DM patient healthy control consider exploratory . A baseline summary outcome descriptive variable use PROBE trial produce use mean ( standard deviation ) normally distribute continuous variable , median ( interquartile range ) non-normally distribute continuous variable , count ( percentage ) categorical variable . Should unexpected significant finding occur result test , communicate patient GP . This stated consent form healthy control . - Test re-test : The aim analyse determine whether diastolic strain rate measure 3T scanner ( gold standard ) comparable measure 1.5T scanner . Descriptive characteristic participate test-retest sub-study summarize . Diastolic strain rate summarize use mean ( standard deviation ) median ( interquartile range ) , appropriate , scanner . Bland-Altman Limits Agreement produce . The formal end study occur follow final 12 week assessment final patient recruit We conduct two follow-up visit assess maintenance 6 12 month ( study end ) . We collect data weight , blood pressure , lipid profile glycaemic control . Patients ask consent investigator access long-term follow-up ( 10 year ) review clinical record Hospital Episode statistic flag Health Social Care Information Centre . - Study intervention : Recruited participant randomise one three group PROBE study ; 1 . Standard care per NICE guidance plus lifestyle advice 2 . Total Dietary Replacement ( TDR ) 3 . Supervised exercise training . - Participant Compliance : TDR Group Participant Compliance : Previous study LED/VLED TDR indicate compliance 70-80 % . The patient TDR exercise group regular contact investigator encourage compliance offer support . The standard care group also receive weekly telephone call encourage compliance suggest lifestyle change . Participants offer Â£50 compensation complete three assessment , take approximately 3-4 hour . However , patient TDR arm achieve loss &gt; 4 % body weight week 1 10 % week four consider non-compliant exclude study . Exercise Group Participant Compliance : Compliance assess attendance supervised session . Participants exercise arm attend less two third supervise session first 4 week exclude ( PI discretion apply determination necessary ) . - Alterations medication regime : Due potential risk hypoglycaemia symptomatic hypotension ; medication enrolment need adjust initially throughout study TDR exercise training group . Participants randomise TDR group : Will ask discontinue glucose lower therapy baseline study , previously advise recently publish study similar intervention ( 8 week ) . Metformin Sulphonylureas discontinue 72hours prior initiation TDR . DPP IV inhibitor 2 , GLP-1 therapy SGLT2s discontinue 2 week prior initiation TDR . Antihypertensive drug stop day TDR commence . This safety measure blood pressure likely fall substantially ( mean drop SBP ~ 20mmHG ) diet . Medication adjust DiRECT study protocol ( see supplementary material ) however , individual clinical decision may necessary patient 's best interest therefore alteration medication ultimately make discretion study clinician ( ) . Blood pressure monitor throughout study clinical review session per DiRECT protocol . Treatments condition primary prevention cardiovascular disease ( e.g . statin ) continue . This discussed detail decide upon level individual , initial consultation . Furthermore , medical history take participant history constipation bowl relate problem prescribe fibre supplement i.e . fybogel help prevent occurrence . We ask participant continue habitual level physical activity throughout course study . Participants achieve 50 % reduction excess body mass completion 12-week programme revert maintenance diet complete assessment 12 week . Participants randomise exercise training : Will medication review study clinician . Those HbA1c â¤ 8 % currently take sulphonylurea initially dose reduced 50 % 72hours prior first exercise session . Their regime continue titrated start sulphonylurea move , applicable , onto current SGLT DPP-IV GLP-1 therapy accord glycaemic control . The latter therapy titrate last give relative low risk hypoglycaemic event . For participant HbA1c â¤ 8 % take sulphonylurea study clinician titrate glucose-lowering therapy individual basis , take account class combination therapy prescribe . All medication maintain unless study clinician deem alteration necessary patient 's best interest . Any alteration record CRF statistically adjust analysis . - Psychological support : This support provide form health coach approach inclusion relapse prevention strategy . This model work base upon patient center approach employ principle health psychology behavioral medicine , skill attitude health coach motivational interviewing . The aim focus upon participant intrinsic motivator , explore barrier encourage development personally determined solution . The initial clinical consultation allow review participant 's gain engage TDR training programme potential barrier may arise individualise solution . This record participant take away form basis telephone/face face follow group support . There convergence evidence multiple source approach beneficially impact behavioural change . - Participant clinical review : All participant initial clinical review post-randomisation time health coaching . In order ensure continue safety participant follow discontinuation and/or reduction mediation regime invite basic clinical review week first four week fortnightly thereafter . They attend six review randomisation total ( week 1,2,4,6,8 , 12 ) , well receive telephone consultation week 3 10 . At clinical review blood pressure , fast glucose weight measure . This inform ; ) additional alteration medication need make b ) compliance TDR ( group ) . In addition , participant access telephone support diabetes team case symptom concern glycaemic control .
