	<detailed_description>Severe vision loss patient proliferative diabetic retinopathy ( PDR ) frequently result complication related neovascularization fibrovascular proliferation . Patients PDR typically consider candidate par plana vitrectomy ( PPV ) non-clearing vitreous hemorrhaging , tractional retinal detachment ( TRD ) development extensive fibrovascular proliferation occur . Visual prognosis guard patient undergo PPV advance presentation PDR high rate intra-operative postoperative complication . Intra-operative bleeding may result poor visualization PPV increase total surgery time ultimately lead surgical failure , recurrent/persistent postoperative vitreous hemorrhage may occur high 75 % hinder visual rehabilitation monitoring disease progression . Preoperative administration bevacizumab ( Avastin ; Genentech , Inc , South San Francisco , California , USA ) , full-length recombinant humanize monoclonal antibody target vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) , report prospective clinical trial decrease overall surgery time , low rate intra-operative complication , reduce occurrence postoperative hemorrhaging PDR patient active neovascularization and/or extensive fibrovascular proliferation undergo PPV . Furthermore , two meta-analysis study examine publish randomize controlled trial support use intravitreal bevacizumab ( IVB ) preoperative adjunct . Although IVB widely use preoperative adjunct patient PDR undergo PPV , little clinical data available regard optimal timing preoperative IVB administration effective dose . In randomized prospective study , attempt elucidate appropriate interval dose administration preoperative IVB patient PDR undergo PPV non-clearing vitreous hemorrhaging , TRD extensive fibrovascular proliferation .</detailed_description>
