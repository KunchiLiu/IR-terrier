	<brief_summary>The study two phase : Phase B Phase C. The purpose Phase B study determine performance ( sensitivity specificity ) smartphone application ( DelApp ) identify delirium whole inpatient sample . The study also aim determine performance ( sensitivity specificity ) DelApp discriminate delirium ( without dementia ) dementia ( without delirium ) . The purpose Phase C study determine efficacy DelApp software application detect delirium unselected patient inpatient sample determine performance DelApp discriminate delirium dementia . The study also aim explore performance DelApp track change cognitive function .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigator previously develop new neuropsychological test objective measurement inattention delirium , implement purpose-built computerise device ( Delbox ) . A prototype software application ( DelApp ) smartphones develop base test . The DelApp many advantage exist test , include objectivity , automate score ease-of-use . Studies 30 hospital patient show highly comparable performance Delbox DelApp . Further proof-of-principle single-rater study use DelApp 200 hospital patient provide additional evidence good performance DelApp . Though strong positive finding investigator pilot study , larger-scale formal study blind raters representative patient sample require . The propose study part large programme work fund Medical Research Council ( grant value Â£1.01M ) optimisation clinical validation DelApp , consist three stage : Phase A - optimisation DelApp feasibility test ( REC 15/SC00/19 ) ; Phase B - case-control study select patient ; Phase C - validation study unselected patient . Ultimately investigators aim generate software product fully license commercially available healthcare organisation . The proposed Phase B study carry hospitalised patient general acute medical ward ICU . The objective study ( ) assess diagnostic performance DelApp discrete patient group inform optimal cut-points ( Phase B ) ; ( b ) evaluate diagnostic performance DelApp unselected patient ( Phase C ) . The study also contribute good understanding nature neuropsychological deficit underlie delirium . At end study , DelApp may modify depend study result . Investigators select stimuli subtests provide best balance sensitivity specificity . Two case-control study conduct involve patient recruit general acute ward ( Study B.1 ) ICU ( Study B.2 ) . Each study run two site , i.e . Royal Infirmary Edinburgh ( RIE ) Glasgow Royal Infirmary ( GRI ) . The performance DelApp ( index test ) reference standard diagnosis independently assess two trained raters , one pair raters site . As prior case-control study , convenience sample use , clinician ask identify patient target group . Hospitalised patient ask undertake number test bedside . These test administer patient . Patients visit two different researcher day , gap approximately 15-60 min assessment visit assume consent provide first visit . The first visit involve assessment capacity ( think likely capable give consent ) obtain informed consent , well assessment delirium ( reference test ) cognition . The second visit involve DelApp assessment ( index test ) . Thus , index test reference test administer independent raters . Where patient unable provide consent , proxy consent seek , grant , visit occur . The Phase C formal validation study similar design case-control study . The main difference unselected sample patient recruit general acute medical ward ( Study C.1 ) ICU ( Study C.2 ) GRI RIE . A subset patient study C.1 C.2 ( N=60 combine ) undergo 4 repeat assessment ( least one day apart ) , along reference standard , explore performance DelApp track change cognitive function . In longitudinal assessment , researcher ask patient able provide consent time recruitment consent subsequent assessment even time subsequent assessment patient lack capacity . However , subsequent assessment , carefully check patient assent continue participation study . In patient initially lack capacity include consent legal proxy , undergo serial assessment , researcher seek informed consent patient begin new test session . If patient regains capacity final assessment , investigator seek retrospective consent patient possible .</detailed_description>
