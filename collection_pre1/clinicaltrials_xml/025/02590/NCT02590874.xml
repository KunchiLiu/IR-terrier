	<brief_title>The Use Duloxetine Cognition Improvement Individuals With Mild Cognitive Impairment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The goal study conduct proof concept clinical trial use antidepressant therapy improve cognition . This study utilize randomize , double blind , placebo - control trial design . The investigator recruit 100 patient . Patients screen multiple time determine eligibility . Patients randomize one two study group ( placebo control group Duloxetine group ) . Patients Duloxetine group receive 60 mg FDA approve antidepressant , Duloxetine . Patients control group receive placebo exact shape size study drug . The patient , primary investigator , research personnel blind study condition . The investigator designate one on-site personnel serve data safety monitor . This person blind randomize patient condition , work pharmacy , un-blind condition necessary . Potential patient invite screening visit . This visit design ensure patient meet study criterion safe participate study . The screen visit consist physical examination , medical psychological history , cognitive functional testing , interview , questionnaire , research/clinical venipuncture , meeting study doctor . If patient accept trial , he/she expect stay study minimum 6 month . After screen visit , study team meet determine patient continue remain study . If patient remain study , he/she invite randomization visit . Patients randomize either Duloxetine group placebo control group . The data safety monitor use randomization software . This program allow researcher enter number subject , condition , generate table randomly assign patient condition . The patient study personnel blind condition . The data safety monitor randomly assign patient condition work pharmacy properly label study drug . Only data monitoring personnel un-blinded generate table random number . After randomization , patient undergo vitals , interview , test , study drug dispense . First dosage consist 30 mg Duloxetine placebo , participant ask take first dose visit . Patients invite 2 week post randomization visit consist meeting study doctor discus concern side effect . Medication dosage raise 60 mg Duloxetine placebo . Patients see monthly next three month . During visit patient receive study drug , vital sign measure , questioned adverse event health change . One month later , patient follow visit . This visit consist follow interview neuropsychological testing , clinical/research blood draw , study doctor visit . This final data collection study visit . The investigator reduce dosage study drug 30 mg visit . The patient instruct investigator wean study drug time . The last study visit 2 week follow-up visit . This visit consist study debrief patient . At visit investigator discontinue study drug . The investigator also arrange data monitoring personnel un-blind study time . No data collect visit . The participant inform whether study drug placebo . If patient study drug group wish remain Duloxetine , patient advise discuss personal healthcare provider . Research data store managed secure manner follow NIH guideline accord state institutional policy . Only authorized key personnel shall access research related document . All personnel properly train supervise regard management handle confidential material . The Principal Investigator assume full responsibility training , supervision , conduct . All data store lock file cabinet behind locked door PIs research laboratory enter research database . Computer-based data entry require hard copy storage . All data collect via paper-pencil double enter research database independent research assistant result check quality control ( QC ) . Once hard copy enter , scan PDF file storage ; hard copy shred . We maintain original sign consent form record ( document shred keep lock file cabinet ) . Electronic scan file store password protect file security purpose . All discrepancy validate chart review data merge large database . The database contain item-level data avoid need subsequent data entry process potential data analysis arise . Periodic QC check conduct IT personnel provide PI . All electronic record maintain password protect computer behind locked door PI 's office space .
