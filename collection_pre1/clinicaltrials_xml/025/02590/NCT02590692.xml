	<brief_summary>The Phase I/IIa clinical trial design assess feasibility delivery safety Human Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived RPE Cells parylene membrane ( CPCB-RPE1 ) patient advance , dry age-related macular degeneration . Primary Objective : • To test safety tolerability CPCB-RPE1 subretinal implantation patient geographic atrophy evidence involvement central fovea . Secondary Objective : • To assess visual acuity , visual field , retinal function CPCB-RPE1 implantation . Implanted fellow eye compare post-implantation ass ability implant prevent disease progression . Exploratory Objectives : • To assess feasibility measure change area geographic atrophy time use spectral domain optical coherence tomography fundus autofluorescence .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Subretinal Implantation Human Embryonic Stem Cell-Derived RPE Cells Advanced Dry AMD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study include two cohort , 10 patient . For first cohort , study population patient advance , dry AMD evidence significant geographic atrophy involve fovea . These patient significant central vision loss best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) eye implant BCVA 20/200 worse . Each patient substantial RPE photoreceptor loss . Patients screen overall health status minimize risk associate retinal surgery subsequent immunosuppression . As safety tolerability CPCB-RPE1 demonstrate first cohort , patient less advanced disease recruit second cohort Phase I/IIa clinical trial . In second cohort patient significant central vision loss BCVA eye implant 20/80 worse , good equal 20/400 comparably less damage RPE/photoreceptor complex Cohort 1 . These patient screen manner overall health status minimize risk associate retinal surgery subsequent immunosuppression . Assessments visual function Cohort 1 .</detailed_description>
