	<brief_summary>We define refractory nasopharyngeal carcinoma follow : recurrence radiation brain injury radiotherapy , recurrence second course radiotherapy , standard treatment failure recurrence , first-line treatment failure multiple distant metastasis . There standard treatment refractory nasopharyngeal carcinoma . Platinum plus 5-Fu classic regimen primary treatment nasopharyngeal carcinoma . Endostatin multiple target angiogenesis inhibitor act tumor associate neovascular endothelial cell , normalize morphology function tumor vasculature , indirectly lead quiescence reduction tumor . The purpose phase II clinical trial determine efficacy safety nedaplatin plus continuous low dose 5-Fu intravenous infusion combine endostar® ( Recombinant Human Endostatin Injection ) continuous intravenous infusion compare nedaplatin plus continuous low dose 5-Fu intravenous infusion alone refractory nasopharyngeal carcinoma . The study hypothesis nedaplatin plus continuous low dose 5-Fu intravenous infusion combine endostar® continuous intravenous infusion effective safe refractory nasopharyngeal carcinoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Phase II Clinical Trial Chemotherapy With Without Endostar® Continuous Intravenous Infusion Refractory NPC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>With extension survival time nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) , patient suffer recurrence radiation brain injury radiotherapy , recurrence second course radiotherapy , standard treatment failure recurrence , first-line treatment failure multiple distant metastasis . We define four type refractory nasopharyngeal carcinoma [ 1-2 ] due complex high risk treatment poor prognosis . For recurrence metastasis NPC , objective response rate range 25 % 46.4 % platinum-based , 5-Fu-based , gemcitabine-based salvage chemotherapy [ 2 -- 5 ] . At present , standard treatment refractory nasopharyngeal carcinoma . Most patient trial pretreated cisplatin-based chemotherapy . Nedaplatin equivalent antitumor effect cisplatin less renal toxicity gastrointestinal toxicity treatment NPC [ 6 ] . In addition , nedaplatin cross tolerance cisplatin . After cisplatin failure , nedaplatin ( 80-100 mg/m2 ) still work NPC treatment [ 3 ] . 5-Fu classic , effective , safe chemotherapeutic drug NPC treatment . Low dose continuous intravenous infusion 5-Fu ( 300mg/m2/d , 6 week ) effective regimen recurrent metastasis NPC low toxicity [ 4 ] . Endostatin multiple target angiogenesis inhibitor act tumor associate neovascular endothelial cell , normalize morphology function tumor vasculature , indirectly lead quiescence reduction tumor [ 7-9 ] . Anti-angiogenic therapy might optimally require endothelial cell expose steady blood level inhibitor , blood level certain angiogenesis inhibitor ( endostatin ) high low ineffective [ 7,10 ] . Endostar® recombinant human endostatin injection well medicinal property , stability curative effect . Hoekman K. etc conduct phase I clinical pharmacokinetic study advance cancer result show continuous intravenous pump endostar® safe [ 11 ] . Moreover , endostar® combine chemotherapy improve outcome chemotherapy alone increase treatment related toxicity , advance non-small-cell lung cancer [ 12 ] , advanced cervical cancer [ 13 ] , advance gastric cancer [ 14 ] also metastasis NPC [ 15 ] . Given patient trial follow feature : receive standard radical treatment , poor tolerance treatment due toxicity many course chemotherapy , present treatment goal palliative therapy . Therefore , treatment principle trial use low toxicity , well tolerance treatment regimen relieve control tumor , improve quality life , prolong survival time . Based background consider Efficacy tolerability , use nedaplatin plus continuous low dose 5-Fu intravenous infusion chemotherapy regimen , administrate endostar® continuous intravenous infusion . This phase II randomize control trial investigate efficacy safety nedaplatin plus continuous low dose 5-Fu intravenous infusion combine endostar® ( Recombinant Human Endostatin Injection ) continuous intravenous infusion compare nedaplatin plus continuous low dose 5-Fu intravenous infusion alone refractory nasopharyngeal carcinoma .</detailed_description>
