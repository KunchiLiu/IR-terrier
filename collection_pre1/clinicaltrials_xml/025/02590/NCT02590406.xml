	<detailed_description>Obesity prevalence population increase . Thus grow number obese patient need surgical intervention . These patient four time high risk suffer serious complication relation airway management compare non-obese patient . This explain increased incidence difficulty ventilation intubation obese . The time available clinician manage airway define non hypoxic apnea time . This laps time dependent oxygen stock patient , dependent functional residual capacity ( FRC ) oxygen consumption . For non-obese patient , normal pre-oxygenation three minute 100 % oxygen allow non hypoxic apnea time ( oxygen saturation &gt; 90 % ) 8,9 minute . However , morbidly obese , time cut le three minute . The major goal pre-oxygenation increase alveolar partial pressure oxygen available end-expiratory pulmonary volume . This do replacing nitrogen alveolus oxygen increase pulmonary stock , FRC . It demonstrate FRC induction anesthesia cut half obese . This reduction explain diminished thoracic compliance increase dependent lung region ' atelectasis cephalic position diaphragm . Various pre-oxygenation method describe prolong non hypoxic apnea time obese population . Some propose pre-oxygenation strategy patient head position ( beach chair ) . It position derive ramped position describe best visualized obese patient ' glottis . Others propose pre-oxygenation strategy positive pressure ventilation , supine position study concomitantly . Individually , techniques pre-oxygenation superior combination supine position positive pressure . Indeed , study demonstrate beach chair position ( derive ramp position ) positive pressure pre-oxygenation supine position diminish time need obtain satisfactory pre-oxygenation ( End-expiratory oxygen fraction &gt; 0,9 ) long non hypoxic apnea time . Sill , strategies never combine protocol . The beach chair position without positive pressure ventilation become standard care position allow best glottis view . Though , show Boyce coll . reverse Trendelenburg position , beach chair , increase non hypoxic apnea time , recuperation time minimal saturation obtain compare supine position . We think advantage use reverse Trendelenburg position optimize non hypoxic apnea time . Indeed , hypothesis less pressure diaphragm comparison beach char position . A studied realize group ( EPO2-PV ) evaluate effect three position ( Reverse Trendelenburg , beach chair supine ) two ventilation strategy ( spontaneous ventilation without positive pressure ) morbidly obese FRC laboratory . The result show statistically significant difference FRC pre-oxygenation positive pressure compare pre-oxygenation without positive pressure , regardless position . Moreover , ventilation strategy , result demonstrate statistically significant superiority FRC obtain pre-oxygenation reverse Trendelenburg compare beach chair supine position . No improvement show beach chair position . Thereby , current study try correlate FRC result obtain laboratory actual non hypoxic apnea time operate room . This research design try compare , patient receive general anesthesia bariatric surgery , effect pre-oxygenation positive pressure reverse Trendelenburg position , non hypoxic apnea time comparison actual standard care , beach chair position without positive pressure ventilation .</detailed_description>
