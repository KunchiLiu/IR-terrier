	<brief_summary>Drug efficacy test one important task routinely undertaken National Malaria Control Program ( NMCP ) Tanzania recommend World health Organisation monitor efficacy artemisinin base combination therapy ( ACT ) possibly detect evolution/emergency tolerance/resistance drug . Currently , Artemether-lumefantrine ( ALu ) ACT recommend Ministry Health Social Welfare therefore test new ACTs dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine ( DHA-PQ ) important alternative drug urgently require . Meanwhile , NMCP revise guideline treatment malaria Tanzania DHA-PQ earmark alternative ACT use together ALu . However , efficacy safety data DHA-PQ miss since study do Tanzania . Thus , study propose assess efficacy safety DHA-PQ Vs ALu provide important data enable NMCP make informed decision ; possibly recommend DHA-PQ new Malaria treatment guideline second line drug treatment uncomplicated malaria country .</brief_summary>
