	<detailed_description>Electric pulse may use transiently permeabilise cell membrane , enable passage otherwise non-permeating molecule . This dramatically enhance cytotoxic effect certain chemotherapeutic agent , term electrochemotherapy . Electrochemotherapy standardly use treatment cutaneous metastasis various cancer 100 cancer center around Europe . The intention trial investigate possible use electrochemotherapy recurrent head neck cancer palliative treatment . Surgery radiotherapy , possible addition chemotherapy , cure large part patient head neck cancer . However , event recurrence curative option may exhaust patient refer palliative chemotherapy . It patient group , investigator propose electrochemotherapy clinical trial . The electrochemotherapy administer once-only treatment , possible retreatment eight week . Under general anesthesia , chemotherapy administer intravenously , follow application electric pulse tumour area . Before treatment , location spread tumour determine image . The trial include evaluation response MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) PET/CT ( Positron Emission Tomography - Computed Tomography ) scan ( base-line , 4 week , 8 week ) , tissue sample , well adverse event registration questionnaires quality life . The plan study phase II clinical study , prospective , observational 25 patient . Treatments perform collaboration Department Oncology , Copenhagen University Hospital Herlev , extensive experience electrochemotherapy , Department Ear Nose Throat Surgery Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet , surgical expertise set-up need .</detailed_description>
