	<criteria>Patients must recurrent persistent endometrial carcinoma Patients follow histologic epithelial cell type eligible : endometrioid adenocarcinoma , serous adenocarcinoma , undifferentiated carcinoma , clear cell adenocarcinoma , mixed epithelial carcinoma , adenocarcinoma otherwise specify ( N.O.S . ) , mucinous adenocarcinoma , squamous cell carcinoma , transitional cell carcinoma , carcinosarcoma . Age ≥ 18 year Patients must least one four prior chemotherapeutic regimen management endometrial carcinoma ( include neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant chemotherapy ) . Initial treatment may include chemotherapy , chemotherapy radiation therapy , and/or consolidation/maintenance therapy . Chemotherapy administer conjunction primary radiation radiosensitizer WILL count systemic chemotherapy regimen . Patients tumor must know PI3K pathway activation define EITHER follow CLIAapproved molecular diagnostics test : Genomic alteration result loss PTEN function include ) whole partial gene deletion , frame shift mutation , nonsense mutation . Missense mutation PTEN consider qualify . A previously characterize activate mutation component pathway include : PIK3CA , AKT1 , PIK3R1 , PIK3R2 , mTOR Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 0 1 Resolution adverse effect recent surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy Grade ≤1 prior first study treatment ( exception alopecia neuropathy ) . Patients must measurable disease . Measurable disease define RECIST ( version 1.1 ) . Measurable disease define least one lesion accurately measure least one dimension ( long diameter record ) . Each lesion must ≥ 10 mm measure CT , MRI caliper measurement clinical exam ; ≥ 20 mm measure chest xray . Lymph node must ≥ 15 mm short axis measure CT MRI . No active infection require antibiotic ( exception uncomplicated urinary tract infection ) . Any prior therapy direct malignant tumor , include immunologic agent radiotherapy , must discontinue least 2 week prior first study treatment . Adequate hematologic define follow laboratory result obtain within 14 day prior first study treatment : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1500/10^9dL Platelet count ≥ 100,000/10^9dL Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL Adequate hepatic function define follow laboratory result obtain within 14 day prior first study treatment : Total bilirubin≤1.5x upper limit normal ( ULN ) AST ALT ≤ 3.0x ULN ( unless patient Gilbert 's Syndrome , case AST ALT ≤ 5.0x ULN permit Albumin ≥ 3.5 g/dL Adequate renal function define follow laboratory result obtain within 14 day prior first study treatment : Serum creatinine≤1.5x ULN OR creatinine clearance ≥50 mL/min basis CockcroftGault glomerular filtration rate estimation For patient ( regardless know diabetes ) follow require screening : Fasting blood glucose ≤ 135 mg/dL ( 7.49 mmol/L ) HbA1c ≤7.0 % For patient childbearing potential , agreement use two effective form contraception ( e.g. , surgical sterilization , reliable barrier method , birth control pill , contraceptive hormone implant ) continue use duration study 30 day last LY3023414 dose . Patients must enrol , agree consent companion genomic profiling study MSKCC IRB # 12245 . Willingness sign write informed consent study . Patients know concurrent activate RAS/RAF mutation loss function mutation deletion NF1 NF2 result MAP kinase pathway activation . Patients require evaluated alteration already perform . Patients diabetes require insulin require one noninsulin hypoglycemia agent . Patients previously treat mTOR , AKT , PI3K inhibitor ( include limit GDC0941 , GDC0980 , BEZ235 , BKM120 , LY294002 , PIK75 , TGX221 , XL147 , XL765 , SF1126 , PX866 , D87503 , D106669 , GSK615 , CAL101 , everolimus , temsirolimus , ridaforolimus ) . For agent list , Study PI CoPI make determination . History myocardial infarction unstable angina within 6 month prior first study treatment . New York Heart Association Class II great congestive heart failure . Patients QTcF interval &gt; 450 msec screen electrocardiogram ( ECG ) Note : If &gt; 450 msec first ECG , 2 additional ECGs order day average may use determine eligibility . History malabsorption syndrome condition would interfere enteral absorption . Inability unwillingness swallow pill Clinically significant history liver disease , include cirrhosis current alcohol abuse . Active hepatitis B hepatitis C infection . Patients previously resolve hepatitis B infection eligible . Presence positive test result hepatitis B infection resolve infection ( define positive HB surface antibody ( antiHBs ) polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) assay negative HBV DNA ) eligible . Patients positive HCV antibody eligible test HCV RNA negative . Known HIV infection . Need current chronic corticosteroid therapy ( ≥ 10 mg prednisone per day equivalent dose antiinflammatory corticosteroid ) Pregnancy , lactation , breastfeed Current severe , uncontrolled systemic disease ( e.g. , clinically significant cardiovascular , pulmonary , metabolic disease ) Major surgical procedure significant traumatic injury within 28 day prior Day 1 anticipation need major surgery course study treatment . Known untreated active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases ( progress require anticonvulsant corticosteroid symptomatic control ) . Patients history treat CNS metastasis eligible , provide meet follow criterion : Presence measurable disease outside CNS No radiographic evidence worsen upon completion CNSdirected therapy evidence interim progression completion CNSdirected therapy screen radiographic study No history intracranial hemorrhage spinal cord hemorrhage No ongoing requirement dexamethasone therapy CNS disease ( anticonvulsant stable dose allow ) Absence leptomeningeal disease Inability comply study followup procedure . Any disease , metabolic dysfunction , physical examination finding , clinical laboratory finding , investigator 's opinion , give reasonable suspicion disease condition contraindicate use investigational drug may affect interpretation result render patient high risk treatment complication .</criteria>
