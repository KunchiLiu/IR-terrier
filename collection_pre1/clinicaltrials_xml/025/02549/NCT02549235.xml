	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION There lot increase interest recent year prevalence diagnosis congenital uterine anomaly ( Chan et al 2011 ; Saravelos et al 2008 ) . This intensified introduction several new classification malformation , include recent ESHRE-ESGE classification ( Grimbizis et al , 2013 ) . Most clinical interest , affect daily clinical practice diagnosis treatment septate uterus , commonest anomaly amenable treatment ( Homer Li , 2000 ) . Since new ESHRE-ESGE classification , introduce new objective method diagnosis anomaly , measure percentage fundal indentation consider septate uterus &gt; 50 % . To knowledge study yet assess woman undergo ART order demonstrate whether indeed percentage fundal indentation correlate either clinical pregnancy clinical miscarriage . Indeed , upmost importance , decision operate so-called septate uterus base whether true impact clinical outcome . This topical present era IVF/ICSI , new classification uterine anomaly , certain author criticize new ESHRE-ESGE classification significantly over-diagnosing septate uterus risk cause unnecessary intervention ( Ludwin et al , 2015 ) . AIMS AND HYPOTHESES Aim : To determine whether extent fundal indendation uterus negative effect clinical outcome woman undergo IVF/ICSI . Hypothesis : Fundal indentation &gt; 50 % associate low clinical pregnancy rate high miscarriage rate . PLAN OF INVESTIGATION Subject recruitment : Women infertility recruit Assisted Reproductive Technology Unit department Obstetrics Gynaecological , Prince Wales Hospital . They inform possibility 3DUS assessment time embryo transfer . Since woman unit undergo ultrasound-guided embryo transfer routine , anticipate 90 % subject undergoing embryo transfer participate consent 3DUS assessment . Study design : Prospective cohort observational study . Inclusion criterion : Described Elsewhere Exclusion criterion : Described elswhere Power calculation : To knowledge previous study perform use ESHRE-ESGE classification similar context , therefore power calculation easily applicable . Nevertheless , give recent meta-analysis suggest septate uteri relative risk 2.65 ( Venetis et al , 2014 ) first trim miscarriage , therefore , unit miscarriage rate approximately 15 % , 53 woman septate uteri 53 woman normal uteri would adequate demonstrate significant difference miscarriage rate apply ESHRE-ESGE classification . Since pregnancy rate unit approach 40 % , new ESHRE-ESGE classification preliminary finding indicate approximately 25 % woman diagnose so-called septate uterus , 530 woman would need recruit establish association ( use alpha 0.05 , beta 0.2 power 0.80 ) Procedure : All ultrasound examination perform use GE Voluson series ultrasound machine , standard 3D transvaginal probe ( model RIC5-9-D ; 6.6 MHz central image frequency ) . The examination 3DUS identical routine 2D examination include acquisition 3D volume take second . The image show instantly operator store digitally onto hard disc attach ultrasonography machine subsequent analysis . For purpose homogeneity reduce operator bias , principal applicant ( SS ) perform 3DUS examination . Outcome measure : Described elsewhere Data processing analysis : The researcher ensure confidentiality sensitive data minimize number personnel handle subject data . The computer data encrypt required maximize security . Data processing statistical analysis perform use Statistical Packages Social Sciences Windows ( SPSS , Inc ) . Data present percentage , mean standard deviation , median range appropriate . Comparisons group carry Student T test continuous variable , ANOVA mean value comparison , Chi-square/Fisher 's exact test categorical data . Stepwise logistic regression analysis may perform part systematic analysis primary outcome . P-values &lt; 0.05 consider significant . Monitoring interim analysis : As study perceive safe pose additional hazard , Data Monitoring Committee interim analysis consider necessary . There known adverse effect routine ultrasound No extra pain discomfort associate 3DUS . Consent : All subject give detailed explanation study write consent form sign patient retain confidential record .</detailed_description>
