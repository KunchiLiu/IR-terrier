	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This multi-center study . INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT : To ensure safety combination treatment , initial safety run-in conduct first 6 subject . This initial cohort 6 subject enrol treated standard dos describe . Based toxicity analysis initial 6 subject follow completion 18 week treatment , determine extend safety run-in period would beneficial . In absence receiving prior therapy , eligible subject treat follow D1 cycle last 21 day ( 3 week ) maximum 6 cycle : - Pembrolizumab 200mg administer 30-minute intravenous ( IV ) infusion every 3 week . - Paclitaxel dose 175mg/m2 administer 3-hour continuous IV infusion . - Carboplatin dosed area curve ( AUC ) 6 give IV infusion 250ml D5W 30 minute . Subjects prior radiotherapy/platinum-based chemotherapy must initiate paclitaxel carboplatin follow reduce dose level prior external radiotherapy involve whole pelvis abdomen 50 % spine , and/or prior platinum-based chemotherapy , cancer . Eligible subject treat follow Day 1 ( D1 ) cycle last 21 day ( 3 week ) maximum 6 cycle : - Pembrolizumab 200mg administer 30-minute intravenous ( IV ) infusion every 3 week . - Paclitaxel dose 135mg/m2 administer 3-hour continuous IV infusion . - Carboplatin dose AUC 5 give IV infusion 250ml D5W 30 minute . Subsequent dos paclitaxel carboplatin may escalate high dos indicate , provide subject exhibit hematologic nonhematologic toxicity &gt; Grade 1 , except alopecia . The following laboratory value must obtain within 14 day prior registration protocol therapy : Hematopoietic : - Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) &gt; 9 g/dL ( without transfusion erythropoietin ( EPO ) dependency within 7 day assessment ) - Platelets &gt; 100 K/mm3 - Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1.5 K/mm3 Renal : - Creatinine measured/calculated creatinine clearance ( calculate institutional standard ) ≤ 1.5 X institutional upper limit normal ( ULN ) OR ≥60mL/min subject creatinine level &gt; 1.5 x institutional ULN Hepatic : - Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) OR direct bilirubin ≤ ULN subject total bilirubin level &gt; 1.5 ULN - Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) , alanine transaminase ( ALT ) alkaline phosphatase ( ALP ) &lt; 2.5 x ULN OR ≤ 5 x ULN subject liver metastasis - Albumin ≥ 2.5 mg/dL Coagulation ( Blood Clotting ) Tests : - International normalized ratio ( INR ) prothrombin time ( PT ) ≤ 1.5 x ULN unless subject receive anti-coagulant therapy long partial thromboplastin time ( PTT ) within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant - Activated partial thromboplastin time ( aPTT ) ≤ 1.5 x ULN unless subject receive anti-coagulant therapy long PT PTT within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant</detailed_description>
