	<brief_summary>Hemiplegic adult stroke ( stroke ) , child adolescent cerebral palsy ( CP ) muscle spastic paresis . These movement disorder likely cause muscle change structural viscoelastic involve alteration neuromotor function walk . Therefore , seem interesting study structure muscle available image technique . The medial gastrocnemius muscle present architectural characteristic allow easy evaluation 2D ultrasound . The literature lack data reproducibility measurement , 2D ultrasound , pennation angle muscular thickness , particularly child . In addition , sonoelastometry Supersonic ShearWave Imaging ( SSI ) new technique ultrasound , non-invasive , dynamic , allow calculation modulus elasticity within muscle tissue . This allow consider new perspective evaluation viscoelastic property muscle . No study evaluate reproducibility method adults/children/ adolescent stroke hemiplegia .</brief_summary>
