	<brief_title>Outpatient Physical Therapy Intervention Subjects With Parkinson 's Disease Currently Using APOKYNÂ®</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multicenter , outpatient trial evaluate PT outcomes subject diagnose PD currently use APOKYN . Those subject satisfy eligibility criterion randomize 2 treatment group : 1 . `` APO+ '' ( APOKYN treatment PT Intervention Visit ) ; 2 . `` APO- '' ( APOKYN treatment withhold PT Intervention Visit ) . The study : - Baseline Assessment Visit ( ) - 1 day Investigator 's clinic PT clinic - APOKYN Response Verification Visit - 1 day - PT Intervention Visits - 6 week - End-of-study Assessment Visit ( ) - 1 day Investigator 's clinic PT clinic All subject participate standardized PT intervention . In treatment group , ALL subject arrive PT Intervention Visit `` end-of-dose-off '' motor state . The `` end-of-dose-off '' motor state achieve subject withhold his/her carbidopa/levodopa dose APOKYN dose least 3 hour PT Intervention Visit . It hypothesize outcome PT improve subject `` '' motor state PT Intervention visit compare `` end-of-dose-off '' motor state PT Intervention visit .</detailed_description>
