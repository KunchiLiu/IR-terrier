	<brief_summary>This pilot neoadjuvant vaccine study adult WHO grade II glioma , surgical resection tumor clinically indicate . Co-primary objective determine : 1 ) safety feasibility neoadjuvant approach ; 2 ) whether regimen increase level type-1 chemokine CXCL10 vaccine-specific ( i.e. , reactive GBM6-AD ) CD8+ T-cells tumor-infiltrating leukocyte ( TILs ) surgically resect glioma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Low-grade glioma ( LGG ) , common pilocytic astrocytomas , diffuse astrocytomas , oligodendrogliomas , mixed oligo-astrocytomas diverse family central nervous system ( CNS ) neoplasm occur child adult . Based data American Cancer Society Central Brain Tumor Registry United States ( CBRTUS ) , approximately 1800 LGG diagnose 2006 , thus represent approximately 10 % newly diagnose primary brain tumor United States . Pilocytic astrocytomas ( WHO grade I ) common brain tumor child 5 19 year age3 . Diffuse astrocytomas , oligodendrogliomas , oligoastrocytomas consider WHO grade II low grade glioma ( LGG ) common adult . Pilocytic astrocytomas generally well circumscribe histologically radiographically amenable cure gross total resection . In contrast , diffuse astrocytomas , oligodendrogliomas , oligoastrocytomas infiltrative less amenable complete resection . From molecular genetics standpoint , common alteration LGG IDH1 mutations6 mutation tumor suppressor gene TP53 , locate chromosome 17 , gene product multifunctional protein involve regulation cell growth , cell death ( apoptosis ) , transcription . Additionally , several molecular factor favorable prognostic significance , particularly presence 1p/19q co-deletion IDH1 mutation . WHO grade II LGGs extremely high risk undergo malignant transformation aggressive lethal WHO grade III IV high-grade glioma ( HGG ) . Even combination available therapeutic modality ( i.e. , surgery , radiation therapy [ RT ] , chemotherapy ) , invasive growth resistance therapy exhibit tumor result recurrence death patient . Although postoperative RT LGG significantly improve 5-year progression-free survival ( PFS ) , prolong overall survival ( OS ) compare delayed RT give time progression . Early result randomize trial radiation therapy plus procarbazine , lomustine , vincristine ( PCV ) chemotherapy supratentorial adult LGG ( RTOG 9802 ) demonstrate improved PFS patient receive PCV plus RT compare RT alone . Nonetheless , PCV considerably toxic currently widely use management glioma patient . Although chemotherapy temozolomide ( TMZ ) currently investigate LGG patient , unknown whether confers improves OS patient . Further , recent study indicate 6 10 LGG case treat TMZ progress HGG markedly increase exome mutation , worrisome , driver mutation RB AKT-mTOR pathway , predominant C &gt; T/G &gt; A transition CpC CpT dinucleotides , strongly suggest signature TMZ-induced mutagenesis ; study also show 43 % case , least half mutation initial tumor undetected recurrence . These data suggest possibility treatment LGG patient TMZ may enhance oncogenic mutation genetic elusiveness LGG , therefore call development safer effective therapeutic modality vaccine . Taken together , LGG consider premalignant condition HGG , novel intervention prevent malignant transformation need evaluate patient LGG . Immunotherapeutic modality , vaccine , may offer safe effective option patient due slow growth rate LGG ( contrast HGG ) , allow sufficient time multiple immunization hence high level anti-glioma immunity . Because patient LGGs generally immuno-compromised patient HGG , may also exhibit great immunological response benefit vaccine . Further , generally mild toxicity vaccine may improve quality life compare chemotherapy RT .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pathological criterion Patients must newly diagnose recurrent WHO grade II glioma ( defined astrocytoma , oligodendroglioma , oligoastrocytoma ) histologically confirm clinically indicate resection . If patient already undergone biopsy pathological diagnosis WHO grade II glioma , pathology must review confirmed UCSF . Before enrollment , patient must show supratentorial , nonenhancing T2FLAIR lesion need surgically resect likely WHO grade II glioma . Surgical resection least 500 mg tumor tissue ensure adequate evaluation study endpoint . Prior radiation therapy ( RT ) initial diagnosis allow . Patients prior RT must least 6 month completion RT ( radiosurgery ) Prior chemotherapy molecularly target therapy allow . Patients prior chemotherapy must least 6 month last dose chemotherapy molecularly target therapy Patients must ≥ 18 year old Patients must Karnofsky performance status ≥ 70 % Patients must corticosteroid least 2 week first neoadjuvant vaccine least 2 week prior first adjuvant vaccine Adequate organ function within 14 day study registration include : Adequate bone marrow reserve : absolute neutrophil ( segmented band ) count ( ANC ) ≥1.0 x 10^9/L ; absolute lymphocyte count ( ALC ) ≥0.5 x 10^9/L ; platelet ≥100 x 10^9/L ; hemoglobin ≥8 g/dL ; Hepatic : Total bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) SGPT ( ALT ) ≤ 2.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) , Renal : Normal serum creatinine creatinine clearance ≥60 ml/min/1.73 m^2 Must free systemic infection . Subjects active infection ( whether require antibiotic therapy ) may eligible complete resolution infection . Subjects antibiotic therapy must antibiotics least 7 day begin treatment . Sexually active female child bear potential must agree use adequate contraception ( diaphragm , birth control pill , injection , intrauterine device [ IUD ] , surgical sterilization , subcutaneous implant , abstinence , etc . ) duration vaccination period . Sexually active male must agree use barrier contraceptive duration vaccination period . History immune system abnormality hyperimmunity ( e.g. , autoimmune disease ) hypoimmunity ( e.g. , myelodysplastic disorder , marrow failure , AIDS , transplant immunosuppression ) History clinical suspicion neurofibromatosis Any isolate laboratory abnormality suggestive serious autoimmune disease ( e.g . hypothyroidism ) Any condition could potentially alter immune function ( AIDS , multiple sclerosis , uncontrolled diabetes , renal failure ) Receiving ongoing treatment immunosuppressive drug Currently receive investigational agent registration another therapy base trial Pregnant lactating</criteria>
