	<brief_title>Investigation Vascular Inflammation Migraine Using Molecular Nano-imaging Black Blood Imaging MRI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Migraine common neurological disorder , rank 7th debilitate disease worldwide WHO . While much research continue conduct illuminate enigma migraine pathophysiology , key aspect still remain conundrum . Specifically , process headache generation perhaps complex debate part migraine pathophysiology . The vascular hypothesis migraine traditionally focus simple dilatation cranial artery . However , possible contribution perivascular pain sensitive structure also consider , aseptic inflammation arterial wall perivascular space may activate afferent nerve ending . Interestingly , giant cell arteritis cause aseptic arterial wall inflammation may present clinically localize headache migraine-like feature ( i.e . throb pain , localized temporal region , allodynia ) . The primary trigeminal nociceptor first integral part headache-generating pathway . Animal model migraine suggest activation sensitization perivascular trigeminal nociceptors cause inflammatory substance may explain head pain migraine . However , human evidence date suggest perivascular arterial wall inflammation source pain migraine . The investigator hypothesize unilateral migraine without aura associate ipsilateral inflammation cranial artery meninges . The investigator also suggest sumatriptan inhibits perivascular inflammation . To test hypothesis investigator perform MRI scan subject provoke migraine attack , use two different method visualize perivascular inflammation : USPIO-MRI , use iron-oxide nanoparticles contrast agent , BBI MRI . To pharmacologically induce migraine headache study subject , investigator use drug cilostazol , phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor .</detailed_description>
