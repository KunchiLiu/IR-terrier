	<brief_title>Evaluation Spinal Cord Stimulation Pulse Rate On Clinical Outcomes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This feasibility study identify optimal frequency stimulation spinal cord achieve maximum reduction neuropathic back pain measured average Numerical rating Scale . Twenty patient suffer back leg pain recruit study satisfactory pain relief low high frequency stimulation . Each patient receive stimulation four different frequency 2-3 week random blind order . Their pain score function assess use variety different tool . The data use estimate optimal frequency .</detailed_description>
