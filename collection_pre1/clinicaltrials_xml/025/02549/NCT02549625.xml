	<brief_title>Phase I Safety Feasibility Study Intracoronary Delivery Autologous Bone Marrow Derived Mononuclear Cells</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study open label Phase I trial determine safety feasibility bone marrow-derived mononuclear cell deliver coronary circulation subject Fontan circulation right ventricular dysfunction . Subjects screen outpatient clinic visit Mayo Clinic interest qualified subject consent offered participation trial . Once informed consent obtain ; preoperative value establish selection committee review subject within three day prior plan procedure confirm inclusion exclusion criterion . This require non-study cardiologist review clinical case confirm baseline cardiac function evidence disease progression right ventricle dysfunction . However , individual decrease cardiac function require inotropic support immediate listing cardiac transplantation NOT include risk research procedure may acceptable . Following cell-based product delivery , subject follow 6-months accord pre-determined schedule include imaging study along questionnaire , electrophysiology laboratory study . Subjects contact additional 18-months surveillance phone .</detailed_description>
