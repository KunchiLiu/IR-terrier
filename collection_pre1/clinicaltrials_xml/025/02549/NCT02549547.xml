Fourteen 15 participant ( 93.3 % ) complete 14-week program love ! In design realization Step-by-Step investigator intentionally 'meet participant . '' The intervention static dynamic constantly evolve process whereby investigator continuously refine program base weekly feedback . As result , investigator able well able meet need participant though mean investigator test change course intervention . Equally , investigator intend program address participant holistically , therefore demand multifactorial approach . Instead test single variable investigator examine impact collection element whole .
