	<detailed_description>SUMMARY Postoperative cognitive dysfunction ( POCD ) contrary event observe 20 83 % , especially elderly , patient submit cardiac surgery . Besides difficult diagnosis , limitation prevention rehabilitation case POCD may compromise quality life increase mortality surgical patient . The neuromodulator effect noninvasive cerebral stimulation , also know transcranial stimulation , low intensity electric current ( tDCS ) study use treatment brain injury depression , also cognitive rehabilitation . The hypothesis use tDCS technique session decrease occurrence POCD cognitively rehabilitate patient submit cardiac surgery . The objective study evaluate effect tDCS occurrence POCD patient submit cardiac surgery cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) After approval constitutional ethic commission , include study 138 adult patient submit cardiac surgery . After subscription consent form responsible patient randomly allocate two group : tDCS GROUP : These patient submit 2 daily session cerebral stimulation , start first day surgery , 4 consecutive day , session 20 minute , minimum break 8 hour . Will apply direct current stimulus 2 milliampere ( mA ) right anode leave cathode prefrontal right region . CONTROL GROUP : In patient apply , equipment use tDCS , simulate stimulus similar active one . They also submit psychological test evaluate mnemonic , attentional , executive global function . The volunteer evaluate model intention treat ( ITT ) recover cognitive function evaluate score test base normative table , primary outcome . The secondary outcome improvement response cognitive test , admission patient last 15 day intensive treatment unity hospital . There also evaluate data relative surgery , cognitive evolution quality life postoperative period . Will also apply neuropsychological test evaluate memory , attention , executive function well another test assess specific content useful describe sample research ' result . The test apply specific data set . Sociodemographic data analyze include education , marital status , occupation , current medication . Signs symptoms depression ass preoperatively use Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) , screen global cognitive use Telephone Interview Cognitive Status ( TICS ) , use Verbal Learning Test ( VLT ) long-term memory Recognition Memory Test ( TEM-R ) visual memory , Symbol Digit Modified Test ( SDMT ) use assess short-term memory , visual search skill attention , STROOP Test ass selective attention , inhibitory ability mental flexibility construct executive function Trail Making Test ( TMT ) assessment selective alternate attention . Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) , consist 21 question explore depressive symptom scale 0 4 , zero represent symptom four maximum symptomatology . A total 14 point consider indicative presence moderate depressive symptom . Patient Questionnaire health ( PHQ-9 ) , questionnaire health patient instrument 9 question . Each question 4 possible response : 0 ( day ) , 1 ( several day ) , 2 ( half day ) , 3 ( nearly every day ) . The PHQ-9 interpret three way : 10 form algorithm , identify individual major depressive episode track probable case major depressive disorder ; 20 continuous measure , score 0 27 point , able ass level depressive symptom cut- point 5 , 10 , 15 20 point = mild depression , moderate , severe serious ; 30 continuous measurement score 0 27 point , classify individual dichotomous use single cutting point ( typically ≥10 ) . The Confusion Assessment Method ( CAM-ICU ) test evaluate delirium ; patient evaluate qualitatively researcher number simple question presence absence postoperative delirium . This review do patient wake anesthesia first hour surgery third day postoperative . The Telephone Interview Cognitive Status ( TICS ) use standardized test ass neuropsychological functioning assess cognitive skill . This test use screen personally impractical patient unable attend clinic . This test consist structure interview 11 item assess skill spatial temporal orientation , mental control , memory , general information , language calculation . Memory assess use Verbal Learning Test ( VLT ) test consist list word . A list 15 word present must store recall three successive attempt ( VLT / A-B-C ) , delay recall 25 minute ( VLT-Delay ) . Rate number word recall number error presentation . The VLT evaluate modality memory immediate , consolidated long-term . This instrument hold two stage : pre-operative time 1st evaluation surgery postoperatively second final assessment day 10 15 postoperatively . The Recognition Memory Test ( TEM-R ) consist store picture word identify remember stimulus . For stimulus response present subject graphic form ( figure ) write ( word ) . This instrument hold two stage : pre-operative time 1st evaluation surgery postoperatively second final assessment day 10 15 postoperatively . The Symbol Digit Modified Test ( SDMT ) apply evaluation short-term memory , visual search skill attention . This graphical task individual fill symbol exemplify space correspond number within 180 second . The result measure number symbol draw number error . Attention assess STROOP Test , consist present three paper sheet subject . The first one , patient verbalize name color print black ink . In second , verbalization make color fill rectangle , provision word previous slide . The third blade consist verbalize color print write word . Evaluates selective attention , inhibitory ability mental flexibility construct executive function . Scores obtain include number word ( Word task ) , number bar color ( Color ) , number color word ( Color-Word ) complete within set time , note , amount time require complete task . We consider number error well . Attention also evaluate use Trail Making Test ( TMT ) assessment selective alternate attention . In part A test , subject must draw line connect consecutively numbered circle . In part B , subject must draw line connect circle alternately letter number sequence . The result measure time trail error . The Attention function examine Trail Making Test ( TMT ) . This test consist two part . In Part A , subject must draw line connect consecutively numbered circle . In Part B , subject must draw line alternately connect circle letter number sequence . The test involve addition alternate selective attention , visual screening complex manual dexterity ( Part A ) executive process ( Part B ) . Among executive procedure , inhibitory ability cognitive alternate seem require complete task . They value time spend number error . These instrument hold two stage : pre-operative time 1st evaluation surgery postoperatively second final assessment day 10 15 postoperatively . The neuropsychological test describe accord group moment application , average usage , standard deviation compare result normative chart Z-score ( ±1,96 ) reference cognitive dysfunction . The data express mean , median , confidence interval ( CI-95 % ) standard deviation ( SD ) evaluate normality , normal data analyze Generalized Estimating Equation ( GEE ) , comparison result two group . P &lt; 0,05 consider significant .</detailed_description>
