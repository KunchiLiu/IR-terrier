	<brief_summary>Secretory otitis medium ( SOM ) middle ear effusion common find acute otitis medium ( AOM ) . It usually associate 5-15 deci Bells hearing loss . Although spontaneous resolution normalisation hear usual outcome , take several month . Secretory otitis medium common cause hearing impairment paediatric age group . When hear loss cause SOM bilateral persists 3-6 month , surgery tympanostomy tube insertion general anaesthesia indicate . In Sweden , 10000 child undergo operation annually . Although many child unilateral bilateral SOM improve summer , problem usually recur autumn winter . The cost SOM Swedish society 600 million Swedish crown 2005 . In two previous study , investigator conclude nonsurgical treatment method , develop assist child SOM equalise middle ear pressure , could normalise hear level 80 % child SOM minimum duration 3 month . These child avoid therefore grommet insertion . The investigator would like assess effect new treatment method hear directly AOM . The investigator expect use new method could rapidly normalise hearing case thereby operation grommet insertion could avoid .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Early Non-Surgical Treatment Children With Middle Ear Effusion Hearing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Secretory otitis medium ( SOM ) middle ear effusion common cause hearing impairment child . Hearing loss occurs due accumulation fluid middle ear . In case , SOM follow acute otitis medium ( AOM ) . In case SOM bilateral persists 3-6 month , operation grommet insertion general anaesthesia indicate . 10000 child SOM operate grommet insertion every year Sweden . In case unilateral hearing loss cause SOM , grommet insertion rarely indicated duration symptom less one year . Some patient develop persistent perforation eardrum extrusion tympanostomy tube . A new method middle ear pressure equalisation develop Sahlgrenska University Hospital . 45 child age 2-8 year SOM persist 3 month treat new method wait period grommet insertion . 80 % child cure regain normal hearing avoid operation . No complication/side effect notice compliance good . Aim study : To assess effectivity new nonsurgical treatment method equalisation middle ear pressure rapid regain hear acute otitis medium 2,5-7 year old child . Study design : Quantitative Hypothesis : Can new nonsurgical method rapidly normalise hear child middle ear effusion/secretory otitis medium acute otitis medium . Material Method : 80 child age 2,5-7 year offer , directly complete treatment AOM , inclusion study . All patient undergo first visit microscopic examination ear , audiogram tympanogram . The child randomise thereafter two group . The first group treat new method one week . While group actively treat act control . Both group undergo one week randomisation new examination microscopic examination ear , audiogram tympanogram . These examination repeat one three month . Intervention : The first group verify middle ear effusion AOM treat new nonsurgical method middle ear pressure equalisation . A face mask connect tube colour balloon attach . The tube also connect balloon . A safety valve use prevent high air pressure . A balloon hidden green soft toy form frog . The parent child hold face mask mouth child blow balloon . On need , mainly begin treatment course , parent press frog 's abdomen order fill balloon air . On first day , low pressure balloon use , change balloon high pressure . If effect notice , ( child experience click sound one ears ) third day , balloon replace new balloon additionally high pressure . Full compliance treatment define 20 blow ( 5 minute ) morning even one week . Expected result importance : The investigator expect study show new treatment method SOM secondary AOM rapidly effectively improve hearing affected child . This great significance medical , social economic point view . Hearing impairment paediatric age group great negative impact speech development disadvantageous child parent also whole society .</detailed_description>
