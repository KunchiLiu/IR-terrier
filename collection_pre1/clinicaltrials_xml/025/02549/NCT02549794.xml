	<brief_summary>According CT technology development , cardiac CT useful examination noninvasive examination accuracy locate lesion increase 95 % . Specifically , cardiac CT perform gateway role reduce invasive cardiac angiography implement solely purpose diagnosis invasive test makeshift cardiac angiography . However , cardiac CT also come disadvantage patient avoid expose radiation , much effort appeal reduce expose radiation dose . Of method , effective method repeatedly reconstitution way synchronize prospective ECG use low tube-based potential . According recent study , SNR ( Signal Noise Ratio ) CNR ( Contrast Noise Ratio ) value represent image quality high compare combine method image reconstruction makeshift filter back projection condition image acquisition patient BMI . Also , administer amount contrast agent reduce achieve contrast effect due advantage increase effect contrast enhancement use low tube voltage . Therefore , efficacy study use low concentration contrast agent condition use low tube voltage process . This study intend prove image quality deteriorate suitable image reconstruction method low concentration contrast agent compare combine method makeshift filter back projection image reconstruction method condition image acquisition accord BMI general amount contrast agent .</brief_summary>
