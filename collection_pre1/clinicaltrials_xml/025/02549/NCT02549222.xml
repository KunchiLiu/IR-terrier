	<brief_summary>This study prospective , non-randomized sequential cohort , open label , multi-center , non-inferiority , Phase IV surveillance study follow transfusion INTERCEPT PCs . The patient population hematology-oncology patient , include undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant ( HSCT ) , expect require one PC transfusion . For participate center , study start brief pilot run-in period group least 5 patient exposed conventional PCs . The purpose pilot run-in evaluate study logistics data collection method within study center . Data pilot phase include data listing include treatment comparison . After pilot run-in period , study conduct two sequential patient cohort : 1 ) Control cohort study patient receive conventional PCs , 2 ) INTERCEPT cohort patient receive INTERCEPT PCs . Patient enrollment Center monitor target similar number patient Control Test Cohorts within center . Within Center , patient enrollment stratify four category : ( 1 ) chemotherapy ; use conditioning regimen hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) ( 2 ) myeloablative conditioning , ( 3 ) non-myeloablative conditioning , ( 4 ) reduce intensity use Center International Blood Marrow Transplant Research ( CIBMTR ) criterion . To ensure Test Control cohorts similar allocation ratio ( ±10 % per category ) among condition regimen stratum , enrollment cap set Test cohort , hence Test patient enrol stratum cap give stratum met .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study pilot run-in period two sequential cohort group center . Pilot Run-in Period The pilot run-in period conduct center group least 5 patient exposed conventional PCs , provide inform consent data collection . The purpose pilot run-in evaluate study logistics data collection method within study center . Data collection differ require two sequential patient cohort . The data pilot phase include data listing include treatment comparison . Control INTERCEPT Cohorts Following run-in period , study conduct two sequential cohort period . Informed consent data collection without study specific treatment intervention , patient confidentiality , require cohort prior study procedure . During Control cohort period , patient study data collect follow transfusion conventional PCs 21 day transfusion support , clinically indicated manner consistent local standard care . During INTERCEPT phase , patient receive INTERCEPT PCs clinical treatment guideline . Patients transfuse study PCs assign treatment type ( Conventional INTERCEPT ) cohort . Enrollment stratify study center type primary disease therapy ( autologous HSCT , allogeneic HSCT , cord blood HSCT , chemotherapy ) . For cohort , patient support study PC transfusion maximum 21 day platelet transfusion independence . Patients consider achieved platelet transfusion independence 5 day elapse exposure study PC transfusion . When patient achieves platelet independence , patient complete study PC transfusion period ( even subsequently resume another cycle platelet support ) . Data collection participant comprise : patient baseline disease characteristic , include primary disease , type HSCT ( auto , allo , cord blood , match relate matched unrelated ) type chemotherapy , medication study entry study observation period . Patient clinical respiratory status , include chest imaging study baseline prior first study transfusion cohort period , also record . Within study cohort , patient assess primary outcome measure assist ventilation maximum 28 day ( 7 day surveillance follow 21 day study PC transfusion support ) . Furthermore , AEs ( include TRs ) collect primary medical record 24 hour follow initiation study PC transfusion . ; SAEs ( include ARDS ) , Grade 2 high AEs affect Respiratory System , mortality collect 7 day post study transfusion ( hospital discharge/discontinuation outpatient platelet transfusion support , whichever sooner ) . Investigators assess intensity AE SAE provide assessment relationship AE SAE study transfusion . Patients experience outcome assist ventilation , ARDS , Grade 2 high AEs affect Respiratory System assess detailed Assessment Pulmonary Adverse Events synopsis Protocol Section 8.1 . For patient achieve platelet independence Study Day 21 , AEs collect 24 hour initiate last study platelet transfusion prior platelet independence ; outcome assist ventilation , SAEs , ARDS , Grade 2 high AEs affect Respiratory System , mortality collect 7 day last study PC transfusion prior platelet independence ( hospital discharge/discontinuation outpatient platelet transfusion support , whichever sooner ) . For patient require 21 day PC transfusion support , AEs record 24 hour initiation last platelet transfusion include Day 21 ; outcome assist ventilation , SAEs , ARDS , Grade 2 high AEs affect Respiratory System , mortality collect maximum 28 day ( 7 day 21 day platelet transfusion support ) ,7 day initiate last study transfusion within 21-day study transfusion period ( hospital discharge/discontinuation outpatient platelet transfusion support , whichever sooner ) . Study-specific research personnel review patient medical record record study outcomes electronic Case Report Forms ( eCRF ) . The intensity AEs SAEs grade accord recent version Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) classification system . The AEs SAEs cod use MedDRA ( Version 18.0 high ) . TRs also assess follow CDC National Healthcare Safety Network ( NHSN ) Biovigilance Component Hemovigilance Module Surveillance Protocol ( NHSN Protocol ) .</detailed_description>
