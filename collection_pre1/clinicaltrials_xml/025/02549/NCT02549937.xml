	<brief_summary>Primary Objective : To evaluate safety tolerability sulfatinib patient advance solid tumor determine maximum tolerable dose ( MTD ) recommend phase II dose ( RP2D ) . Secondary Objective： To evaluate pharmacokinetic profile multiple dose sulfatinib patient advance solid tumor evaluate anti cancer activity sulfatinib patient advance solid tumor .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Multi-Center , Open-Label Study Sulfatinib ( HMPL-012 ) Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study open-label , dose escalation clinical trial sulfatinib orally daily ( QD ) patient advance solid tumor . The study consist two phase : Dose escalation phase - A 3+3 design use portion study . - Approximately 15 30 evaluable patient enrol . The actual number patient depend Dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) situation well RP2D dose level reach trial . - The trial approximately evaluate five sulfatinib dose level 50,100 , 200 , 300 400 mg/day . Expansion phase : The expansion phase confirm MTD select RP2D dose escalation phase . In consultation study investigator , observed toxicity , tolerability , drug exposure evaluate . Approximately 6 patient advance solid tumor enrol phase evaluate safety , tolerability pharmacokinetic ( PK ) characteristic confirm select sulfatinib dose . Subjects receive RP2D sulfatinib daily treatment continuously every 28-day treatment cycle disease progression , death , intolerable toxicity investigator 's discretion favorable benefit risk balance .</detailed_description>
