	<brief_summary>While last several year see great stride treatment relapse form MS , progressive MS , responsible majority MS-related disability , lag far behind . Despite much research , lack understand related cause patient ' relentless decline function result inability develop target treatment strategy suitable clinical trial . This grant two main goal . The first goal extend investigator preliminary study rat neuron treat CSF MS patient large number Progressive patient order validate initial finding extend study include analysis human neuron . The initiate PI ( Dr. Casaccia ) Partnering PI Clinical Neurologist ( Dr. Katz Sand ) recently identify component present CSF progressive patient impair ability rat neuron produce energy . The partnering PI , Dr. Quinzii ( Columbia University ) together collaborator Dr. Fossati ( NY Stem Cells Foundation ) , characterize human neuron generate stem cell derive skin biopsy progressive patient detect presence energetic deficit . The experimental plan build result test hypotheses disease progression . The overall goal improve understand stop neuron degenerate stop clinical progression . The second goal ask whether possible define progressive disease course basis combine biochemical , functional imaging measurement . The initiate PI responsible biochemical assessment CSF serum sample , together partner PI Quinzii , also provide functional bioassay measurement mitochondrial bioenergetics impairment patient . These data combine clinical assessment MRI evaluation conduct partner PI Katz Sand collaborator Inglese . A two year clinical imaging follow initial recruitment allow define whether combined measurement use clinical neurologist define disease course well identify therapeutic option patient . The expectation completion state aim research allow advancement current knowledge progressive form MS lead potential new therapeutic target .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : male female subject age 18 old diagnosis one following : 1 . RRMS accord McDonald 2010 criterion diagnosis CIS clinical symptom MRI consistent MS 2 . PPMS accord McDonald 2010 criterion 3 . SPMS define least six month progressive decline follow initial relapse disease course able willing undergo clinical evaluation , MRI , lumbar puncture , skin biopsy return follow assessment end year 1 year 2 able willing provide inform consent . Exclusion criterion : pregnancy inability undergo lumbar puncture , due anticoagulant therapy hold day procedure result screen laboratory test presence another medical condition would render procedure unsafe , determined investigator inability undergo MRI , due presence metallic implant incompatible MRI reason presence severe medical condition likely influence study result raise likelihood harm patient result study participation , determine investigator ( e.g . presence brain mass , could influence CSF result also might make lumbar puncture unsafe ) inability complete protocol reason</criteria>
