	<brief_title>Effect CVVH NGAL Septic AKI</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Acute kidney injury ( AKI ) increasingly common potentially catastrophic complication critically ill patient . The incidence AKI increase recent year ; half patient intensive care unit ( ICU ) develop AKI . AKI associate significantly increase length hospital stay high mortality rate . Approximately , 50 % AKI induce sepsis . Continuous renal replacement therapy ( CRRT ) become routine patient AKI , chronic renal failure , ï¬‚uid overload well oliguria ICU . In clinical practice , continuous venovenous hemofiltration ( CVVH ) actually method choice CRRT critically ill hemodynamic instable patient . CVVH significant beneficial effect remove inflammatory cytokine , improve oxygen index , decrease vasopressor requirement , increase cardiac index , regulate immune dysfunction , specifically patient septic shock . So far , uniform standard define time discontinuation CRRT AKI , predict recovery renal function patient AKI CRRT difficult . The Beginning Ending Supportive Therapy Kidney ( BEST Kidney ) study suggest urinary output &gt; 500ml per day predictor successful discontinuation CRRT . However , urinary output often affect clinical intervention ( e.g . use diuretic ) . Thus , great importance find reliable biomarker reflect renal function patient receive CRRT . Cystatin ( Cys ) C receive interest previous study . The result show serum Cys C concentration decline different type RRT ( include intermittent hemodialysis CVVH ) . This indicate Cys C unfit indicator persistent renal injury renal recovery critically ill patient CRRT . Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin ( NGAL ) , 25-kDa protein covalently bind gelatinase neutrophil , generally express low level several human tissue , however , case ischemia , infection , toxic damage , NGAL rapidly release activate neutrophil . Numerous study confirm NGAL well indicator AKI serum creatinine ( SCr ) . Schilder colleague report plasma level NGAL critically ill patient AKI affect continuous venovenous hemofiltration ( CVVH ) . However , remain unclear also apply sepsis-induced AKI , considerable evidence suggest pathophysiology septic AKI different cause AKI .</detailed_description>
