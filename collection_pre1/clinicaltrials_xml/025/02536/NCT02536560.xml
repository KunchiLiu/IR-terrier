	<brief_title>Intestinal Microbiota Composition After Antibiotic Treatment Early Life</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Healthy newborns born hospital , observe low probability neonatal infection compare newborn expose antibiotic therapy early life ( first 1-2 week ) . Infants recruit maternity ward neonatal ward four teach hospital Netherlands . In total 150 infant , treat antibiotic ( high suspicion ) perinatal infection first week life , recruit . The control group comprise 300 healthy newborn , born hospital need clinical observation 24-48 hour several reason like maternal comorbidity , low probability neonatal infection , blood sugar monitoring , meconium contain amniotic fluid , delivery caesarean section . Differences clinical outcome antibiotic treat infant control investigate . Incidence atopic dermatitis ( eczema ) , food allergy , upper respiratory tract infection ( URTI ) , low respiratory tract infection ( LRTI ) , gastrointestinal infection ( GITI ) excessive cry evaluate , prospectively assessed parental report retrospectively assess doctor 's diagnosis . The clinical endpoint link develop intestinal microbiota first year life . Potential difference intestinal fecal microbiota composition diversity determine eight time point first year life , sample moment include : day one ( T1 ) , day two ( T2 ) , one week ( T3 ) , two week ( T4 ) , one month ( T5 ) , three month ( T6 ) , six month ( T7 ) , one year ( T8 ) .</detailed_description>
