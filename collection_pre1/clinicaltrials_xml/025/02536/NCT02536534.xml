	<brief_title>Electronic Activity Level Monitoring Pilot Pulmonary Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Remote patient monitor lead improve patient outcome , include improve quality life , reduced readmission , earlier treatment symptom detect prior schedule in-office follow-up visit , improve communication care provider , increased participation self-management disease , improve knowledge medical condition . In patient PAH , daily activity level , measure use physical activity monitor seven consecutive day , correlate 6-minute walk distance ( 6MWD ) . The monitor use aforementioned PAH study position patient ' right upper arm armband , oppose popular comfortable wristband use today , Fitbit Flex . Although aforementioned PAH study show correlation activity level monitoring 6MWD , patient monitor seven day . It still unknown whether correlation would exist long trial period whether patient , caregiver , clinician would find activity level monitoring useful help manage PH .</detailed_description>
