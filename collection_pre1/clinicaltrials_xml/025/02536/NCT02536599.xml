	<brief_title>Risk Factors &amp; Outcomes Clinically Documented Infections Pediatric Cancer Patients With Fever &amp; Neutropenia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : It long recognize neutropenic patient risk develop serious infection and/or complication . Fever infection represent important complication myeloablative cytotoxic therapy result severe mucositis prolong neutropenia . One important concept approach infection febrile neutropenic patient recognition risk . Risk define two way . First , risk may define term probability develop febrile neutropenic infection ; second , may define term likelihood significantly poor outcome due infection . An understanding risk latter case may use define approaches management ; instance , in-patient versus out-patient treatment strategy administration intravenous versus oral formulation antimicrobial therapy . These consideration significant economic quality life ramification . Many institution develop simple clinical criterion identify low-risk patient without calculate risk-index score . This might practical method busy clinical setting , tool set low resource country . Patients &amp; Methods : The study include child , either refer pediatric oncology clinic , previously admit pediatric oncology department , document episode fever neutropenia South Egypt Cancer Institute ( SECI ) , fulfil criterion enrollment study . All patient time initial evaluation subject complete clinical history full clinical examination . The enrolled patient follow either develop clinically evident infection e.g. , pneumonia , gastroenteritis , meningitis , septicemia , etc . ) , resolution fever and/ neutropenia . The risk either develop clinically evident infection , , assess accord clinical laboratory parameter , present time initial evaluation identify patient would prone develop infection and/ complication Fever define temperature great equal 38.3 C occur temperature great equal 38 C occur twice 24-hour period . Patients absolute neutrophilic count ( ANC ) less 500/mm3 ANC less 1,000/mm3 decreasing consider neutropenic . Complete blood count &amp; diagnostic study , include laboratory study image procedure obtain need evaluate determine source fever and/or infection .</detailed_description>
