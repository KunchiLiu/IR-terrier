	<brief_summary>This phase I/II trial study side effect best dose selinexor docetaxel see well work give together treat patient squamous cell lung cancer come back spread place body . Selinexor may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving selinexor together docetaxel may work well treat squamous cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Selinexor Docetaxel Treating Patients With Recurrent Metastatic Squamous Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate toxicity determine recommend phase II dose combination docetaxel selinexor . ( Phase I ) II . To evaluate efficacy measure progression free survival ( PFS ) docetaxel selinexor patient recurrent/metastatic squamous cell lung cancer . ( Phase I/II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate objective tumor response rate determine radiographic response . II . To evaluated disease control rate ( complete response , partial response , stable disease ) . III . To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) . IV . To evaluate safety tolerability single agent selinexor . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Lung cancer genomics sequence panel . II . Tumor biopsy ( baseline cycle 2 ) . III . Plasma cytokine analysis , peripheral blood ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) analysis . OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study follow phase II study . Patients receive docetaxel intravenously ( IV ) day 1 selinexor orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1 , 3 , 7 , 9 , 13 , 15 . Courses repeat every 21 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow monthly 3 month , every 3 month 9 month , every 6 month thereafter .</detailed_description>
