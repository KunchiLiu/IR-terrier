	<brief_title>Effect Supplementation Fluoride Maternal Periodontal Health , Preterm Delivery , Perinatal Well-Being</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) report preterm birth affect nearly 500,000 baby , 1 every 8 delivery United States year . These statistic emphasize significance implement safe effective therapy routine clinical care aim reduce rate preterm birth . There evidence suggest fluoride supplementation woman pregnancy provide several medical benefit addition reduction dental caries . Critical among perinatal perspective decrease preterm birth rate , increase birth weight length , improved growth development infant . Fluoride recognize Food Nutrition Board American Academy Sciences Food &amp; Drug Administration ( FDA ) nutrient due association important reduction dental caries . The majority fluoride food bound bioavailable , effectively supply supplement dissolve water . Upon enter mother 's body pregnancy , fluoride take maternal bone excrete kidney . Therefore , available fluoride fetus pregnancy . When supplied pregnancy small aliquot , water fluoridation , fluoride rapidly take mother 's bone excrete kidney fetus deny meaningful amount fluoride unless supply pulse dose supplement . Since 1997 , Institute Medicine 's Food Nutrition Board recommend 3 mg/day Adequate Intake pregnancy deem 10 mg/day Upper Limit . After several paper elucidate association poor dentition , periodontal disease , preterm birth , subsequent RCT 's regular periodontal scaling treatment pregnancy still inconclusive regard preterm birth . The investigator hypothesize fluoride supplementation pregnancy may beneficial effect natural microbiome maternal oral cavity genital tract , capable protect transient bacteremia ascend infection , respectively , know antecedent preterm labor preterm premature rupture membrane . The investigator predict test analysis specimen demonstrate microbiome change toward favorable profile associate preterm birth . The propose randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled clinical trial aim confirm efficacy fluoride supplementation pregnancy extend length gestation increase overall perinatal well-being , confirm transplacental transfer supplemental fluoride . This research may also identify beneficial maternal neonatal outcome associate administration fluoride perinatal period attempt characterize compare microbiomes maternal oral cavity genital tract supplement unsupplemented gravida .</detailed_description>
