	<detailed_description>Usually low back pain accompanied male prolong activation back muscle Central Nervous System . It prove male innervation pattern often related spine asymmetrical muscular activation . Biomechanically , asymmetric muscular activation well prolonged activation muscle cause additional stress already damage structure result additional pain . Technical aid like back orthoses bandage suppose relax painful muscle reduce pain way . However , study available analyze systematically effect technical aid activation pattern back muscle . Aim study analyze systematically effect dynamic flexion orthosis Dynaflex® back bandage Lumbo Sensa® activation back muscle via surface EMG . On one hand shall prove analyzed technical aid immediate impact activation back muscle reduces pain symptom continuously . On hand shall demonstrate surface EMG suitable approach examine effect technical aid muscular activation back muscle focus everyday situation movement first time . From result shall conclude everyday effect orthosis bandage discharge back muscle .</detailed_description>
