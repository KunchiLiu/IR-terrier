	<brief_title>LEPU Renal Denervation System Resistant Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , considerable data RDN obtain Western population , clinical outcome RDN East Asian population seldom report . Therefore , purpose evaluate 6-month outcome RDN treatment resistant hypertension Chinese patients.In prospective single-center cohort study , 50 Chinese patient resistant hypertension would recruit undergo RDN LEPU Renal denervation system , similar Symplicity Symplicity renal-denervation system ( Medtronic ) . The primary effectiveness endpoint change systolic diastolic blood pressure six month measure office-based blood pressure assessment 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitor follow therapeutic renal denervation compare baseline . The primary safety endpoint incidence Major Adverse Event ( MAE ) 6 month , include severe renal artery dissection/stenosis ( &gt; 60 % ) require stenting surgery , cerebrovascular accident , myocardial infarction , death .</detailed_description>
