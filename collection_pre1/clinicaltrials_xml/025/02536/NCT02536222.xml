	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction : During last decade , 34 country set objective freeing malaria , obtain remarkable success reduce burden disease low level could represent start point elimination program lead complete elimination . This remarkable success lead several country develop malaria elimination program support Global Malaria Action Plan Roll Back Malaria Partnership : `` For malaria-free world '' objective eliminate malaria least 35 endemic country 2030 . However , transition strategy malaria control toward program center elimination yet document . PATH collaborate PNLP regional district health authority produce evidence allows make decision model reduction malaria transmission health post . To effect , set strategy put place evaluate efficiently identify eliminate malaria infection . Thus , zone free disease document . In Senegal , epidemiological profile malaria present condition disease elimination North North-central area country . Since 2012 , National Malaria control program , support PATH , objective reduce Plasmodium falciparum transmission several geographical area Saint-Louis , Matam Louga region . 2 . Goal Objective : The goal propose work contribute national effort malaria pre-elimination Senegal , line National Malaria control program 's 2014-2018 strategic framework . The main objective strengthen implementation malaria case investigation Linguère , Ranérou Kanel district , evaluate operational aspect scale strategy evaluate impact malaria transmission guide evidence-based decision-making . 3 . Sites : The work conduct six health post region Matam ( Kanel Ranérou district ) Louga ( Linguère district ) , choose basis malaria incidence rate , wide difference transmission villages health post catchment area , proximity availability historical data 2014 . Malaria elimination strategy already implement health post 2015 , thus protocol aim strengthen activity . Seven health post similar characteristic chosen control . 4 . Study design A quasi-experimental study design use evaluate impact intervention . The incidence malaria case prevalence parasitemia compare intervention intervention control area ( difference-in-differences ) . Cross-sectional survey conduct estimate parasitemia prevalence RDT begin end high transmission season intervention control area . 5 . Methodology Systematic malaria case investigation perform village 6 intervention health post . All malaria case passively detect health post community confirm positive rapid diagnostic test ( RDT ) consider index case investigate . A team ( field worker community health worker ( DSDOM ) ) visit household index case 5 closest household ( 100 radius ) test RDT individual live household . Any household least one positive RDT ( include index case ) receive systematic focal drug administration ( FDA ) treatment dihydro-artemisinin-piperaquine ( DHA-PQ ) 6 . Duration : The study schedule last one year . ( July 2015-June 2016 ) .</detailed_description>
