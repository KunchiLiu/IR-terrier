	<detailed_description>GRANT APPLICATION The mental health crisis team well establish vital part mental health system . These team uniquely equip provide front-line mental health care need . It able provide on-site assessment , crisis management , treatment , referral , educational service patient , family , law enforcement officer , community large . Mental health crisis team provide access mental health care even under-served population efficiently cost-effectively . The cost-effectiveness team 's service define saving monetary human term ( Zealberg , Santos , &amp; Fisher , 1993 ) ( Scott , 2000 ) . However , intervention develop , specific service . Patients attend crisis team usually wait appointment , like health setting . This valuable time use deliver short term educational intervention . This tried tested general health setting ( Coyne , Palmer , Shapiro , Thompson , &amp; DeMichele , 2004 ; Holmes-Garrett , 1990 ; Oermann , n.d. ; Rhodes et al. , 2001 ; Wheeler et al. , 2001 ) . As far aware wait room intervention try test psychiatric setup . We develop intervention RESOLVE ( Relaxation Exercise , SOLving problem cognitiVe Errors ) , easily deliver use eMedia ( example tv screen ) wait room . This intervention short enough give patient wait room psychiatric clinic . A crisis team set might ideal patient might find problem solve approach helpful . We want conduct pilot use Randomised Controlled Trial design ( RCT ) ass effectiveness intervention . METHODS Objectives The primary objective preliminary pilot study ass effectiveness `` wait room intervention '' patient attend crisis clinic . The objective study see intervention reduce ( 1 ) symptom depression anxiety , ( 2 ) overall psychopathology , ( 3 ) disability . Participants Participants ( N =40 ) primarily recruit Crisis Clinic Kingston . Inclusion criterion ; All fulfill diagnostic criterion Depressive episode ( F32 ) Recurrent depressive disorder ( F33 except 33.4 ) use ICD10 RDC , age 18 65 . Patients ask attend appointment end study period assess . The exclusion criterion include ; excessive use alcohol drug ( use ICD 10 RDC alcohol drug abuse dependence ) significant cognitive impairment ( example learn disability dementia ) active psychosis . Data keep strictly confidential , available primary investigator . Participants may withdraw study time without penalty . Study design This preliminary evaluation use Randomized Control Trial ( RCT ) design . Randomization perform use www.randomization.com , list patient consent . Study participant randomly assign either treatment control arm . The treatment group receive wait room intervention plus TAU ( Treatment As Usual ) , control group receive TAU . Patients refer study provide brief information study . Those meet criterion consent ask join study allocate one arm trial randomization . Measurements Demographic information collect use short questionnaire . Assessments carry two research assistant independently . We also collect data number contact Crisis Team , number admission duration contact Crisis Team . The Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ( HADS ) ( Zigmond Snaith , 1983 ) 14 item , self assessment scale design measure anxiety depression . It high internal consistency , face validity concurrent validity . Even-numbered question relate depression odd-numbered question relate anxiety . Each question 4 possible response . Responses score scale 3 0 . The maximum score therefore 21 depression 21 anxiety . A score 11 high indicates probable presence mood disorder score 8 10 suggestive presence respective state . The two subscales , anxiety depression , find independent measure . In current form HADS divide four range : normal ( 0-7 ) , mild ( 8-10 ) , moderate ( 11-15 ) severe ( 16-21 ) . The Clinical Outcome Routine Evaluatoin ( CORE ) client self-report questionnaire design administered therapy . The client ask respond 34 question feel last week , use 5-point scale range 'not ' 'most time ' . The 34 item measure cover four dimension : Subjective well-being , Problems/symptoms , Life function Risk/harm . The response design average practitioner produce mean score indicate level current psychological global distress ( 'healthy ' 'severe ' ) . The questionnaire repeat last session treatment ; comparison pre-and post-therapy score offer measure 'outcome ' ( i.e . whether client 's level distress change , much ) ( Evans , 2000 ) . The World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 ( WHODAS ) ( Ust√ºn et al. , 2010 ) use measure function . This scale assess disability due physical psychological problem , use extensively research setting . Procedure Patients fulfill inclusion criterion provide information study . Those consent write randomly allocate one arm trial . All participant complete demographic questionnaire , HADS , WHO DAS &amp; CORE interview primary investigator . Participants treatment arm attend 1 session intervention addition Treatment As Usual . Participants control group receive treatment usual time . Participants group assess end 3 month wand 6 month post intervention . Data entry analysis Statistical analysis carry use Intention To Treat , use SPSS v22 . Both parametric non-parametric test carry appropriate compare group . Treatment control group compare baseline , use Chi square test . A linear regression use compare two group end assessment period . This do , use group independent , end assessment score dependent variable . Baseline score variable equally distribute two group use covariates . All analysis carry FN . Results Research Implications If effective , innovative intervention reduce distress , psychopathology disability group possibly improve functioning . Success preliminary study could lead subsequent research investigate novel intervention . Description Research Team 1 . Tariq Munshi : Primary Investigator- co-supervise train team help recruitment 2 . Farooq Naeem : Co-Investigator- supervise Research Assistants conduct study ; conduct statistical analysis 3 Neeraj Bajjaj- Co-Investigator- co-supervise team help recruitment</detailed_description>
