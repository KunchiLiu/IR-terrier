	<brief_summary>To compare platform-switched implant platform-matched implant replacement single miss tooth effect : 1 ) Interproximal alveolar crest level relation implant platform . 2 ) Buccal implant recession . 3 ) Presence absence black triangle apical contact point . 4 ) Implant Success . 5 ) Adequate buccal tissue thickness .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Platform-Matching Versus Platform-Switching Dental Implants Peri-implant Hard Soft Tissue Healing</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thirty patient dental implant place . Fifteen patient randomly select coin toss receive platform-switched implant fifteen receive platform-matched implant . Each patient receive diagnostic work-up include standardize radiograph ( periapicals ) , study cast , clinical photograph , clinical examination teeth adjacent edentulous site . Pre-surgical preparation include detailed oral hygiene instruction . Baseline data collect initial exam , 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 month . Parameters measure include : plaque index , gingival index , probe depth , keratinize tissue , bleed probing , digital radiographic examination . Pre-surgical measurement include : cemento-enamel junction osseous crest adjacent teeth direct measurement surgery , radiograph baseline , 2 , 4 , 6 , 12 month , periodontal form , periodontal biotype , tooth shape , papilla harmony . Patients randomly select treatment group assignment use coin toss surgery mentor . One investigator unaware group assignment perform baseline examination follow-up examination . Means standard deviation calculate parameter . A paired t-test use evaluate statistical significance difference initial final data . An unpaired t-test use evaluate statistical difference test control group . A sample size 15 give 80 % statistical power detect difference 0.5 mm implant bone loss group . All surgical procedure complete one operator direction one mentor . Pre-surgical measurement take first . Local anesthesia administer . The surgical procedure consist reflection full thickness flap expose alveolar crest . The implant platform place 3 4 mm apical mid-facial gingival margin use dental implant osteotomy drill preparation site . The surgical procedure document clinical photograph . Sutures use close flap bury implant tissue . Records keep heal periodically first 8 week , 4 , 6 12 month . The test group use BioHorizons Tapered Internal Plus `` platform-switched '' implant . The control group BioHorizons standard Internal `` platform-matched '' implant . All patient see 1-2 , 4 , 6 8 week monitor heal . At week 8 implant uncover surgically provisionalized , 4 month visit final crown place . Subsequent examination take place 6 12 month . Post-surgically , patient take antibiotic ( doxycycline hyclate 100 mg day two week ) , analgesic ( Vicodin ES every 4-6 hour need pain ) , anti-inflammatory agent ( Naproxen 375mg every 12 hour one week ) . At post-operative visit plaque removal , oral hygiene instruction , need , perform along clinical photograph standardize radiographs schedule . The result study allow comparison peri-implant soft hard tissue heal follow placement BioHorizons `` platform-switched '' Tapered Internal Plus implant versus standard Internal `` platform-matched '' implant term effect marginal bone loss , buccal recession , papilla fill .</detailed_description>
