	<brief_summary>Which splint method produce best outcome ( range movement , pain function ) non-operative treatment stable volar plate injury adult ? The volar plate ligament locate middle knuckle ( proximal interphalangeal joint - PIPJ ) finger . It commonly injure hyperextension , example ball hit fingertip . Current treatment Hand Therapy Unit involve splint injure joint dorsally ( back finger ) 20⁰ flexion ( bent ) use thermoplastic material . However , potential risk develop permanent stiffness PIPJ straightening , volar plate ligament heals . To reduce risk , study aim investigate use volar ( front finger ) gutter splint 0⁰ flexion ( straight ) , still prevent hyperextension , achieve good outcome . There exist high-quality evidence compare two method . This randomise controlled trial . For purpose study , current treatment 20° dorsal block splint act control group . The intervention group volar gutter splint group . A convenience sample use patient ( 16 year old ) present Mid Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust 's Hand Therapy Unit invite participate study , consideration inclusion/exclusion criterion . Participants randomise one two group use random number generator . The outcome assess range movement , pain function . These measure initial assessment , four twelve week . These average normal time interval patient see . Each splint worn four week participant receive standardise advice , exercise treatment .</brief_summary>

Vulnerable patient group lack capacity . 2 . Previous injury pathology involve digit . 3 . Surgical intervention 4 . Unstable proximal interphalangeal joint . 5 .

However , speak/understand English well unfortunately exclude . This educational project therefore funding use translator service . 7 . Volar plate injury common child teenager adult . But 16 exclude study DASH questionnaire assume valid adult . There research investigating use young agegroups .</criteria>
