	<brief_title>The Effects Antipsychotic Drugs Brain Metabolism Healthy Individuals</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Schizophrenia complex psychiatric disorder characterize alteration brain structure . It clear yet whether alteration primarily relate pathophysiology illness per se consequence brain exposure effect psychotropic drug . In recent year accumulate evidence suggest exposure effect psychotropic drug may contribute structural change brain . Therefore , use antipsychotic medication treatment schizophrenia represent potential confound factor many study . Most neuroimaging study schizophrenia date include examination non-medicated patient , make conclusion medication effect neuroimaging measure difficult . MRI study structural brain change across time limit fact due ethical reason neither untreated subject schizophrenia control subject expose antipsychotic medication use comparison group . There preclinical rat primate model reveal chronic antipsychotic-induced alteration brain . However study investigate effect chronic exposure antipsychotic drug healthy human brain . Therefore study , investigator aim evaluate brain alteration induce chronic drug exposure healthy volunteer . To address problem , conduct single-site , single arm , open-label , interventional , multimodal neuroimaging study healthy comparison subject expose antipsychotic medication 15 day . This study include 30 healthy adult ( 21-50 year old ) volunteer . Participants recruit via online advertisement flyer well approach healthy individual participate previous study . Investigators three aim : 1. study level chemical kinetics enzymes associate cellular energy metabolism brain use antipsychotic drug ( use 1P MRS ) . 2. collect data structure gray matter white matter ; rest state functional brain activity ; level brain chemical include glutamate GABA ; white matter integrity use antipsychotic drug ( use structural MRI , fMRI , dTI , 1H MRS ) . 3. investigate side effect antipsychotic drug . It plan give healthy participant single 2.5 mg dose olanzapine follow 5 mg dose 14 day . Olanzapine , second generation antipsychotic agent , select administer medication strong effect energy metabolism general . The recommended daily dose range olanzapine indicate 10-30 mg/d last `` APA ( American Psychiatric Association ) Practice Guideline Treatment Patients With Schizophrenia '' . A recent study suggest minimum effective dose olanzapine schizophrenia 7.5 mg/d ( upper range 5 mg ± 2.5 mg/d ) high olanzapine dos ( 10 , 10 ± 2.5 , 15 , 15 ± 2.5 mg/d ) efficacious placebo . Therefore aim give healthy subject 5 mg/d olanzapine , low limit optimal dose range ( 5 mg ± 2.5 mg/d ) , mimic therapeutic effect also protect participant adverse effect treatment . As goal examine effect chronic drug use , duration medication determine 15 day long safe olanzapine usage period healthy individual . There publish literature effect olanzapine brain measure . Therefore , possible calculate sample size would detect give between-group difference study . Investigators plan recruit sample large enough establish absence moderate large effect . It propose sample size 30 subject allow detect difference effect size 0.45 great significant p &lt; 0.05 level 80 % power . Effect size 0.5 generally consider moderate 0.8 consider large . Therefore , not-statistically significant find sample size suggest effect olanzapine brain metabolism best small . Investigators collect interview neuroimaging data baseline medication period . Deviations induce study drug healthy brain examine use pair t-tests measurement . Investigation parameter use antipsychotic drug healthy people give chance determine brain alteration related drug , independent pathophysiology illness .</detailed_description>
