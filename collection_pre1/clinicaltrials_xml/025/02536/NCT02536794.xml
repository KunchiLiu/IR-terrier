	<brief_summary>The main purpose study determine anti-tumor activity MEDI4736 combination tremelimumab patient metastatic HER2-negative breast cancer . Both MEDI4736 tremelimumab antibody ( protein use immune system fight infection cancer ) . MEDI4736 attach protein tumor call PD-L1 . It may prevent cancer growth help certain blood cell immune system get rid tumor . Tremelimumab stimulate ( wake ) immune system attack tumor inhibit protein molecule call CTLA-4 immune cell . Combining action drug may result good treatment option patient breast cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate clinical benefit rate patient metastatic HER2 negative breast cancer treat MEDI4736 combination tremelimumab . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) patient metastatic HER2 negative breast cancer treat MEDI4736 combination tremelimumab . II . To evaluate safety tolerability . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate tissue-based immunohistochemical expression program death-ligand ( PD-L ) 1 ; tumor infiltrating lymphocyte ( TILs ) ; peripheral T cell subpopulation ; change tissue peripheral T cell receptor genotype ; human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) genotype ; immune-related candidate gene signature predict response MEDI4736 combination tremelimumab . II . To demonstrate pharmacodynamic effect MEDI4736 tremelimumab tissue serum base biomarkers include PD-L1 , TILs , T cell subpopulation , T cell receptor genotype . OUTLINE : Patients receive MEDI4736 intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour tremelimumab IV 1 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Four week last combination dose , patient continue receive MEDI4736 every 2 week 18 additional dos absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients achieve clinical benefit ( complete response [ CR ] , partial response [ PR ] , stable disease [ SD ] ) end 52 week period enter follow-up . During follow-up patient develop PD may re-treated MEDI4736 dose previously administer IV additional 52 week use guideline initial 52 week period meet treatment set PD criterion . Only one 52 week retreatment period allow . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month , every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
