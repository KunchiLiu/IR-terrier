	<detailed_description>The investigator include patient adherent clot gastric duodenal ulcer endoscopic confirmation exclusion possible bleeder . Adherent clot define still stays ulcer 200 ml normal saline irrigation ( 4 time irrigation 50 ml syringe ) . After receive well explanation give write consent , enrol allocate 2 group randomly . Those first group receive intravenous omeprazole 40 mg stat 40 mg q12h . Those second group receive intravenous omeprazole 80 mg stat 8mg/hr infusion . The patient group receive intravenous omeprazole 3 day oral esomeprazole qd treatment peptic ulcer . The investigator record basic data patient include age , sex , use NSAID anit-coagulant , concomitant major disease ; clinical data include Hb , Plt , PT , low systolic pressure allocation heart rate time , shock status , transfusion amount allocation ; endoscopic finding include location &amp; size ulcer , size clot , existence fresh blood stomach duodenum . The investigator monitor event rebleeding admission within 30 day , surgery ulcer bleed mortality within 30 day record amount transfusion hospitalization day allocation . When rebleeding suspect , patient receive endoscopic examination appropriate therapy . Further treatment surgical angiographic intervention decide attend physicians.These patient monitor admission ( 2 week average ) follow GI outpatient clinic . The investigator define rebleeding admission within 30 day primary end point . Rebleeding define one clinical manifestation occur 6 hour allocation : 1.hematemesis bloody stool 2. tarry stool hemodynamic change ( systolic pressure le 90 mmHg , heart 110 beat per minute ) 3. decrease Hb 2g/dl within 24 hour elevation Hb 10 g/dl transfusion .
