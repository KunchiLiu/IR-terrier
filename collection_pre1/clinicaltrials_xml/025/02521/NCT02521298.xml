	<brief_title>Treatment Lateral Elbow Tendinopathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence lateral elbow tendinopathy prevalence 1-3 % , peak incidence 35-50 year age ( Green et al. , 2002 ) . The main symptom pain lateral humeral epicondyle upon palpation pain full resist dorsiflexion wrist . Ultrasonographic change include hyper-/hypo-echoic area increase doppler signal proximal part common extensor tendon . The condition often self-limiting , however full recovery often take month year recurrence common . Several different treatment modality use order increase tendon heal decrease time recovery . Deep transverse friction massage show significant effect pain , grip strength function relative physiotherapy modality ( Brosseau et al. , 2002 ) . Anti-inflammatory treatment NSAID 's corticosteroid typically effective short term , however long term poor outcome treatment strategy include exercise ( Coombes et al. , 2010 ) . Surgery seem beneficial effect ( Buchbinder et al. , 2011 ) , conclusive data regard use orthotic devise treatment lateral elbow tendinopathy ( Struijs et al. , 2002 ) . Eccentric exercise extensor muscle show reduced pain , increase muscle strength , decrease tendon thickness time return sport ( Croisier et al. , 2007 ) . Loading human tendon lead increase tendon collagen synthesis , interestingly , tendon tissue sampling ( biopsy ) , cause minor trauma tendon show increase level growth factor locally stimulate tendon collagen synthesis ( Magnusson et al. , 2010 ) . It hypothesize minimal tissue damage anti-inflammatory treatment could increase tendon heal decrease time recovery , combine mechanical loading .</detailed_description>
