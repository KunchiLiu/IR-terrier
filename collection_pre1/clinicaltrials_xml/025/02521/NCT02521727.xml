Currently removal adenomas effective way reduce cancer incidence mortality . International guideline recommend screen individual average risk CRC age 50 year . Up 30 % average risk asymptomatic individual 50 year old least one adenoma . Based current guideline , nearly half population counsel undergo colonoscopy 40 year old base positive family history adenoma . This enormous burden healthcare system screen implicated individual . Secondly , adenoma carry risk . Large villous adenomas associate nearly 70 % increase risk CRC first degree relative ( FDR ) whereas small adenoma may associate modest increase risk . It therefore important determine risk colorectal neoplasms family subject non-advanced adenoma justify intensive screening individual . The molecular pathway lead tumour development familial colorectal neoplasm likely different sporadic case . Development new molecular base method early detection , prevention treatment relies heavily understand difference sporadic familial neoplasm . Identification genetic mutation also improve genetic diagnosis screen protocol risk population . Investigators hypothesize first-degree relative patient non-advanced adenoma increase risk CRC adenoma .
