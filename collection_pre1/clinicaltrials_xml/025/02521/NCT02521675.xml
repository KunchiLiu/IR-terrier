	<brief_summary>There specific recommendation adjustment insulin treatment event physical activity ( PA ) T1D patient treat insulin pump therapy . Patients often prefer additional carbohydrate intake rather reduction insulin dose lack specific algorithm . The DIABRASPORT 2 study aim demonstrate use algorithm DIABRASPORT , week physical activity ( PA ) , incidence hypoglycaemia different obtain week rest without physical activity . It multi-center European , control , randomize , cross-over , study , 100 T1D patient practice occasional AP . 25 center involve study . After agree participate study , patient read information leaflet , ask question investigator physician date sign consent form . The investigator physician . They draw randomly via electronic CRF ( eCRF ) determine order realize rest v DIABRASPORT session . The study take place 5 week : During week Baseline Diabrasport , patient make 3 physical activity 30 60 minute separate least 24 hour : - moderate activity 3 hour lunch - intense activity 3 hour lunch - activity moderate 90 min lunch They use usual algorithm ( Cho intake adjustment dose insulin ) week Baseline use Diabrasport algorithm week Diabrasport . Patients equip holter Glycemic iPro2 , Medtronic , whose data hidden . During week rest , patient physical activity week . They equip Glycemic holter . Patients fill food survey day practice PA . Between period , patient must respect period wash-out one week least , ask practice physical activity . Validation algorithms simple , easy implement , adaptable patient , could help improve balance metabolic practice sport among T1D .</brief_summary>
