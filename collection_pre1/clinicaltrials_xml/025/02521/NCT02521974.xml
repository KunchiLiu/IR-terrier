	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Safety Immunogenicity Oral Polio Vaccine Type 2 Infants Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . PRIMARY OBJECTIVE The primary objective study assess safety ( serious adverse event [ SAEs ] severe adverse event [ AEs ] grade 3 accord CTCAE 4.03 immunogenicity ( seroprotection rate ) single dose SABIN mOPV2 healthy child age 1 5 year old , infants approximately 18 week age vaccinate 3 dos bOPV 1 dose IPV . 2 . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES Secondary objectives ass : - The safety ( mild moderate solicit unsolicited AEs , Important Medical Events [ IMEs ] , laboratory deviation assessment ) one two dos SABIN mOPV2 healthy child age 1 5 year , 2 dos SABIN mOPV2 infant approximately 18 22 week age vaccinate 3 dos bOPV 1 dose IPV . - The immunogenicity ( seroconversion rate , median geometric mean antibody titer ) one two dos SABIN mOPV2 healthy child age 1 5 year old , two dos SABIN mOPV2 infant approximately 18 22 week age vaccinate 3 dos bOPV 1 dose IPV . 3 . EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES Exploratory objective : - To investigate viral shed follow SABIN mOPV2 administration . - Exploratory objective may also include assessment genetic sequence heterogeneity potential neurovirulence ( measure animal model ( ) ) shed virus . - To investigate viral shed neurovirulence shed virus ; - To evaluate genetic reversion position nt481 ( primarily ) secondary site ( e.g. , nt2908 ) . - To investigate priming response bOPV mOPV2 . ( group 2 ) duration induction anti-polio type 2 neutralizing antibody .</detailed_description>
