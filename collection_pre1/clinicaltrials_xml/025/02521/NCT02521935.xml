	<brief_summary>Purpose : To compare complete denture outcomes conventional digital denture fabrication process . Participants : Sixteen edentulous adult patient University North Carolina School Dentistry Student Clinic seek removable complete denture . Procedures ( method ) : Two complete set dentures fabricate subject : one use conventional process ( A ) use digital process ( B ) . Variability assess research team , treat dental student , independent prosthodontist , patient quantitative measure . Case selection result analysis evaluate recognition Prosthodontic Diagnostic Index .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Conventionally vs. Digitally Fabricated Complete Dentures : Clinical Treatment Outcome Differences</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale Study Design An AB/BA ( conventional=A , digital=B ) crossover design wash-out period flaw study , weakness potential carryover effect ( benefit risk associate treatment A carry treatment B ) . A wash-out period feasible study would require patient-subjects suspend use dentures duration wash-out period . The Investigators decide conduct study use ABB/BAA crossover design , require wash-out period permit test discount possible carryover effect . In addition , design appropriate small sample size AB/BA design . The investigator add scant literature digital denture , information never study - retention , aesthetic , stability digital denture compare conventional denture . Additionally , investigator longitudinal data characteristic regard digital denture . If Functional Assessment Dentures ( FAD ) patient evaluation show positive result digital denture , could lead increase use Computer -Aided Design/ Computer -Aided Manufacturing ( CADCAM ) fabrication method , turn , would allow great number people benefit advantage digital denture describe early application ( e.g. , good fit , few visit less time chair , less biofilm formation , etc . )</detailed_description>
