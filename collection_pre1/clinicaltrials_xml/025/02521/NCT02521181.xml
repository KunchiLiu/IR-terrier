	<brief_summary>The two dos sodium bicarbonate test 0.5 0.8 mEq/kg-lean body weight ( LBW ) per day . Sodium bicarbonate , also know bake soda , may help prevent kidney failure people chronic kidney disease . However , dose prescribe order test possibility clinical trial uncertain . The BASE pilot clinical trial help determine best dose sodium bicarbonate prescribe future study test long-term safety efficacy sodium bicarbonate treatment preserve kidney function individual chronic kidney disease .</brief_summary>
