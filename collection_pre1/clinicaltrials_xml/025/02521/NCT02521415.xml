	<brief_summary>This single center , randomize control , double blind trial prospectively examine feasibility intranasal , sub-dissociative ( IN ) ketamine versus intranasal fentanyl pain control pediatric emergency department set . The investigator hypothesize IN ketamine may provide safe effective alternative IN fentanyl child suspect , isolated extremity fracture . Eighty child age 3-17 year suspect , isolated extremity fracture require analgesia randomized receive IN ketamine IN fentanyl upon presentation emergency department follow 2 hour efficacy 6 hour safety .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>IN Sub-Dissociative Ketamine v IN Fentanyl</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Intranasal medication commonly use place parenteral opioids child . IN fentanyl commonly use intranasal analgesic medication pediatric population demonstrate safety efficacy comparable IV fentanyl IV morphine . IN ketamine , sub-dissociative dos , offer similar safety efficacy IN fentanyl additional advantage potentially reduce total use opioid agent emergency department visit . Ketamine easily store wide therapeutic window extremely low risk cardiorespiratory complication . This study compare safety efficacy IN ketamine IN fentanyl child suspect , isolated extremity fracture pediatric emergency department . The primary aim study examine feasibility future protocol expansion . The investigator conclude additional study NOT feasible observed rate side effect ketamine exceeds fentanyl three-fold event rate 5 % ketamine-related SAEs . The primary aim study compare frequency adverse event 6-hours among child randomize receive either intranasal sub-dissociative ketamine ( IN ketamine ) intranasal fentanyl ( IN fentanyl ) pain control emergency department . The exploratory aim study compare efficacy intranasal ketamine intranasal fentanyl measure reduction age appropriate pain scale score 2-hours . The secondary aim study compare total dose opioid pain medication morphine equivalents/kg/hour require ED evaluation child suspect , isolated extremity fracture randomization treatment IN ketamine IN fentanyl . Eighty child age 3-17 year suspect , isolated extremity fracture require analgesia randomized receive IN ketamine IN fentanyl upon presentation emergency department follow 2 hour efficacy 6 hour safety . All participant premedicated acetaminophen ibuprofen baseline data , include pain level , collect . The trial consist two treatment arm . ( IN ketamine 1 mg/kg IN fentanyl 1.5 mcg/kg ) . Randomization follow 1:1 ratio , approximately 40 per group . Randomization stratify age 3-10 11-17 . The participant assess research coordinator adverse event every 5 minute use adverse event checklist first fifteen minute post study medication administration every 30 minute first two hour drug administration . The vital sign pain scale assessment repeat every 10 minute first 30 minute every 30 minute first two hour drug administration . A final assessment make 6 hour last dose study drug discharge ED ass late side effect adverse event . Study medication may repeat time one reduce dose 20 minute full effect first dose know . The decision administer additional study medication ( 0.5 mg/kg ketamine 0.75 mcg/kg fentanyl ) discretion treat physician . Should second dose study medication require , new schedule patient assessment commence follow schedule first dose . Participant assessment continue 2 hour endpoint reach time last drug administration , final assessment 6 hour last dose study drug discharge ED ass late side effect adverse event .</detailed_description>
