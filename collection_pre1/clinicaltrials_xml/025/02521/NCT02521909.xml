	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare accuracy different apex locator . Before root canal therapy , dentist use device call electronic apex locator ( EAL ) measure root canal locate open tip tooth 's root ( call apical foramen ) . A root canal space inside root tooth . If tissue within root canal becomes infect , dentist may perform root canal therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study generate data compare efficacy three different manufacture instrument commonly use dental clinic . The instrument know electronic apex locator ( EAL ) . Electronic apex locator use measure length root canal locate open end tooth 's root ( call apical foramen ) . A root canal space inside root tooth . If tissue within root canal becomes diseased , dentist may perform root canal therapy ; reason accuracy EAL important . In study patient schedule tooth extraction part standard care pre-screened record review candidacy study subject . If schedule patient screen potentially eligible reviewing record , approach study team time pre-extraction consultation visit ( visit occur prior extraction visit ) . Only teeth schedule extract suitable study . On day standard care tooth teeth extraction ( ) prior extraction study team conduct measurement EALs . After EAL measurement standard care extraction occur standard care , outside study , patient 's clinician . Extracted teeth give study team long need pathological review ( extracted teeth usually discard rarely sent lab analysis ) . Also teeth must extract without break . study team analyze ( ex-vivo ) generate true root measurement compare data generate prior extraction instrument subject study . The instrument subject study , in-vivo data generate instrument compare ex-vivo data gain measurement tooth/teeth is/are extract .</detailed_description>
