	<brief_summary>A randomized cross-over meal study investigate effect protein quality combination dietary fibre protein appetite regulation . The study use basic measure ad libitum energy intake visual-analogue scale appetite ( study A ) . A sub-study ( study B ) additionally include blood collection 15 40 participant investigate biological marker target satiety . The study day conduct least one week apart eliminate carry effect . In sub-study , study day least two week apart due blood collection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Enhanced Satiety With Pork Products Containing Dietary Fibre</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dietary protein show satiate macronutrient , however clear whether various type protein exert effect . The late evidence animal versus plant proteins show difference appetite ad libitum energy intake , neither weight loss well-designed study control macronutrient composition protein-rich food rare therefore need . Dietary fibre also show play role appetite regulation , especially viscous dietary fibre great effect short-term satiety subsequent energy intake less viscous dietary fiber . A combination dietary fibre protein would therefore beneficial formulation satiety-enhancing food target consumer want maintain loose weight . Pork good source high-quality protein essential vitamin mineral . The fat content retail pork cut live Nordic Key Hole nutrition label le 10 g fat per 100 gram . Pork therefore recognize lean meat type deliver key nutrient part diet . Processed pork product sausage , liver pate salami nutritionally characterize high-fat product . However , today meat industry put lot effort product development meat product healthier nutritional profile . The investigator previously show addition wheat rye bran sausages 10 % fat reduce appetite sensation . Also , satisfy effect dietary fiber pronounce added sausage add bread . These finding point towards potential use dietary fibre meat product order improve nutritional profile product well satiating effect . The overall objective investigate effect protein quality combination dietary fibre protein appetite regulation . Dietary protein fibre combine animal protein base food ( fiber-meat ball ) , vegetable protein base food ( veggie `` meat ball '' ) , meal ( meat ball fiber bread ) compare animal protein per se ( meat ball ) . The study use measure ad libitum energy intake visual-analogue scale appetite combination biological marker target satiety . This study contribute substantial increase knowledge macronutrients stimulate effect appetite-regulating hormone . The study focus healthy palatable pork product contain dietary fibre order applicable food industry . The current evidence support need satiating-enhancing food high protein dietary fibre . However , macronutrients stimulate effect appetite-regulating hormone adequately investigate well-controlled study use real food . Likewise , clear evidence animal protein superior vegetable protein regard satiate effect appetite appetite-regulating hormone .</detailed_description>
