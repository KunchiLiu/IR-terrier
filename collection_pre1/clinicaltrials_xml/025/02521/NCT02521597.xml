	<brief_title>Mobile Otoscopy - Efficacy Residents Diagnose Acute Otitis Media Using Smartphone Otoscope Attachment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Acute otitis medium ( AOM ) one common diseases childhood lead cause health care consultation . While otoscope tool traditionally use diagnose AOM , otoscopic diagnostic skill trainees practitioner appear limit . Therefore , new diagnostic method continuously develop . One device smartphone otoscope attachment call CellScope Oto , portable video-otoscope allow resident staff share diagnostic-quality image . Objective : To evaluate resident ' efficacy diagnose acute otitis medium among febrile child present respiratory symptom use smartphone otoscope attachment compare classic otoscope . Methods : This randomize controlled trial evaluate accuracy evaluation ears child visit emergency department ( ED ) suspect AOM resident use CellScope Oto comparison classic otoscope . It perform single pediatric ED tertiary care Hospital . Participants child 1 5 year age present fever respiratory symptom . Baselines characteristic participant assess . Participating resident teach use CellScope Oto practice patient ready participate study . Eligible patient recruit weekday . If parent consent , patient first evaluated staff Pediatric Otolaryngologist use binocular microscope ( gold standard ) . They evaluate two participate resident , one use intervention method one use control . Randomization use decide visualisation method use first . After three exam perform , resident , patient ' parent staff charge ask answer short questionnaire final diagnosis confidence perform exam , favourite method need control exam . These questionnaire review reviewer blind randomization . The primary outcome measure accuracy AOM diagnosis make resident compare diagnosis make staff Pediatric Otolaryngologist use binocular microscope . A sample size 100 participant evaluate twice would provide power 80 % alpha value 0,05 demonstrate difference 15 % rate appropriate diagnosis AOM resident use smartphone otoscope attachment compare classic otoscope use . Expected result : The investigator expect demonstrate 15 % increase efficacy rate AOM diagnosis resident register paediatrics-related program use smartphone otoscope attachment compare classic otoscope . This device potential change current AOM diagnostic practice might , turn , provide reduce amount prescription make every year antibiotic .</detailed_description>
