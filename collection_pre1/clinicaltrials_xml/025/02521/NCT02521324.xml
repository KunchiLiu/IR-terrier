	<brief_title>Effect Device Guided Breathing Sleeplessness ( 2BRT01 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sleeplessness , define difficulty fall asleep maintaining sleep , prevalent one third US population . Sleeplessness find negative impact quality life daily functionality chronic form , also find frequently lead sympathetic over-activity . Stress important factor trigger exacerbate sleeplessness symptom . Current method alleviate problem include drug , modification sleep habit ( also deliver via smartphones ) , cognitive behavior therapy include relaxation technique mindfulness , meditation , diaphragmatic breathing . Breathing pattern modification , do Device Guided Breathing ( DGB ) find affect beneficially cardiovascular system . DGB guide user reduce breathe rate gradually normal value ( 12-20 breaths/min ) slow rate ( 4-6 breaths/min ) increase relative duration exhalation phase . This do compose real time musical tone monitor respiration data user synchronize breathe Breathing pattern modification , do DGB originally implement device call RESPeRATE clear FDA treat hypertension stress use support multiple clinical trial . However , direct effect DGB sleeplessness yet investigate , DGB recently implement mobile system consist Bluetooth enable belt-type breathing sensor iOS mobile application ( 'App ' ) . The App accumulate continuously breathing-related data performance measure . The accumulated data send icloud-based server . The current study single center , prospective , randomize , waiting-list-controlled ( WLC ) clinical trial design evaluate effect DGB sleeplessness use mobile DGB2 system .</detailed_description>
