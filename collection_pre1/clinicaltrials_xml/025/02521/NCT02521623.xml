	<brief_title>SurgiMend® vs. Strattice™ Direct Implant Breast Reconstruction- A Prospective Randomized Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction An increase number Danish woman undergo genetic counseling hereditary breast cancer . If patient´s lifetime risk evaluate 30 % , patient may choose undergo risk-reducing mastectomy ( prophylactic mastectomy ) reduce risk develop breast cancer . The mastectomy mostly perform skin-sparing procedure , nipple area breast tissue remove leave skin envelope intact , order preserve breast skin immediate breast reconstruction . In select case surgery may perform nipple-sparing procedure . Additionally , increase group woman diagnose multifocal DCIS choose risk-reducing mastectomy immediate reconstruction . In order risk-reducing mastectomy effective , utmost importance breast tissue remove . This leave skin flap cover breast thin vulnerable necrosis , handle utmost care . In order spare mastectomy skin flap strain pressure cause breast implant , acellular dermal matrix ( ADM ) increasingly use type procedure . ADMs derive skin human animal , process extent cellular component completely remove , leave extracellular scaffold , thus incite immune response host . The ADM thus provide scaffold , promote integration patient 's connective tissue . In time ADM repopulated revascularized patient 's cell , essentially become integrate part patient body . The ADM provide optimal definition breast border , essentially allow improve implant positioning compare sub muscular coverage technique . If circumstance breast reconstruction necessitate placement expander implant , use ADMs allow great intraoperative expansion , thus subsequently reduce number time patient must attend outpatient 's clinic expansion implant . Thus lead short time expander implant may exchange permanent implant . Furthermore , several study show use ADM lower overall complication rate . Several type ADM use breast reconstructive set around world . Strattice™ porcine derive ADM , available Europe Denmark since late 2008 . In order find best available ADM use immediate breast reconstructive setting , term complication rate patient satisfaction , crucial new product continuously evaluate . SurgiMend® , another type ADM , recently introduce Danish market . SurgiMend® ADM derive fetal bovine dermis , recent study show use SurgiMend® ADM associate low early complication rate . Furthermore , recent study provide evidence ADM derive bovine high mechanical stress tolerance compare porcine derive ADM equivalent thickness . Aim The aim present study evaluate two type ADM´s immediate breast reconstructive setting . The data study possibly help minimize complication increase patient satisfaction find optimal ADM immediate breast reconstruction , thereby contribute faster recovery woman undergo mastectomy immediate breast reconstruction implant ADM. Hypothesis SurgiMend Strattice™ provide equal result regard complication rate , patient report outcome measure aesthetic appearance patient undergo immediate breast reconstruction . Methods The project conduct prospective randomize trial . Patients include study randomize receive either Strattice™ SurgiMend® ADM . Patients allocate 1:1 ratio , 30 patient receive Strattice™ ADM 30 patient receive SurgiMend® ADM . The randomization perform use permuted block randomization . Randomization blind patient outcome assessor . Regardless type ADM patient randomize receive , surgical procedure perform way . Patients include study ask complete BREAST-Q pre-reconstruction module breast reconstruction , BREAST-Q post-reconstruction module 4 12 month breast reconstruction . The BREAST-Q patient report outcome measure tool specifically design validate use breast reconstruction patient . The BREAST-Q module consist several scale , investigate patient body image , satisfaction breast satisfaction care . The BREAST-Q module widely use officially translated Danish language . Participating patient attend standard post-operative control 4 12 month breast reconstruction non-participating patient undergo immediate breast reconstruction . In addition examine operating surgeon control , patient ' aesthetic result evaluate one investigator use breast reconstruction outcome scale , previously develop Dept . Plastic Reconstructive Surgery , Aarhus University Hospital , Aarhus , Denmark . The scale consist six question evaluate symmetry , feel , aesthetic appearance reconstruct breast . Recruitment participant Patients seek immediate breast reconstruction routinely see Dept . Plastic Reconstructive Surgery patient clinic consultant breast surgeon consultant plastic surgeon time . If breast plastic surgeon deem patient eligible primary breast reconstruction plastic surgeon evaluate patient best suit breast reconstruction base implant ADM , patient offer consultation clinical investigator project . If plastic surgeon believe patient good candidate another type breast reconstructive procedure implant ADM , patient offer participation . At consultation investigator , well-instructed colleague , patient give oral write information research project . The patient always offer period least 24 hour decide give consent , may also give informed consent site . Furthermore , patient offer second consultation , information project repeat question regard research project may answer . The patient also encourage bring family member friend second meeting . The patient may time without need justification withdraw consent participate , without affect present and/or future treatment patient . Risks , side effect disadvantage As surgery , risk wound infection , blood clot alter sensation operate area . This lead antibiotic treatment , appropriate , second operation stop bleed remove damage tissue . These risk , however , associate breast reconstruction , associate participate current study . Both type ADM well describe medical literature , type ADM achieve good result compare use ADM immediate breast reconstruction . The risk patient choose participate project thus solely related breast reconstruction , participation current study . Participating patient spend approximately 10 minute complete questionnaire breast reconstruction . Additionally , participate patient ask complete another questionnaire ( approximately 10 min ) 4 12 month breast reconstruction , well participate extra clinical examination routine follow-up examination 4 12 month . The extra examination routine follow-up visit expect take approximately 15 min . per visit . While questionnaire clinical follow-up may consume patient 's time , risk associate . Ethical consideration It expect number woman choose immediate breast reconstruction procedure increase . Conducting study help bring complication rate type surgery utmost importance , individual patient undergo surgery socio-economic setting.The propose study aid find optimal method , term complication rate patient report outcome . All patient invite participate study evaluate experienced breast plastic surgeon best suit immediate breast reconstruction implant ADM . The two type ADMs evaluate study show good result previous study . As expect one test ADMs significantly well , predictable benefit individual patient regard participate study .</detailed_description>
