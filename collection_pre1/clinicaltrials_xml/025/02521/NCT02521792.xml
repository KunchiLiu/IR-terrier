	<brief_summary>Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva ( FOP ) rare , severely disable disease characterize painful , recurrent episode soft tissue swell ( flare-up ) result abnormal bone formation ( heterotopic ossification HO ) muscle , tendon , ligament . Flare-ups begin early life may occur spontaneously soft tissue trauma , vaccination , influenza infection . Recurrent flare-ups progressively restrict movement lock joint lead cumulative loss function disability . Mouse model FOP demonstrate ability retinoic acid receptor gamma ( RARγ ) agonists palovarotene prevent HO follow injury . This 36-month study evaluate long-term safety efficacy episodic treatment palovarotene flare-ups FOP subject successfully complete two flare-up treatment period ( 6 week duration ) two follow-up period ( 6 week duration ) Study PVO-1A-202 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The objective Phase 2 , open-label , multicenter , single-arm study : - To evaluate long-term safety efficacy prior palovarotene treatment 36 month FOP subject complete Study PVO-1A-202 - To evaluate safety efficacy palovarotene FOP subject experience new , distinct flare-ups 36-month follow-up period . The follow-up portion study consist Screening visit correspond last day ( Study Day 84 ) Study PVO-1A-202 bi-annual assessment Months 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 . Subjects experience new , distinct flare-up 36-month follow-up evaluate eligible , receive palovarotene weight-adjusted equivalent 10 mg 14 day follow 5 mg least 28 day . Any subject receive low dose regimen due tolerability issue Study PVO-1A-202 receive tolerate dose . For flare-up two period : 1 . A Screening period occur within 7 day start new , distinct flare-up . The first dose palovarotene take within 10 day flare-up onset allow shipment study medication subject 's home . 2 . A treatment period least 6 week duration . Subjects experience new , distinct flare-up evaluate</detailed_description>

For treatment palovarotene subsequent flareups Symptomatic onset new , distinct flareup within 10 day first dose study drug . Symptoms must report subject , consistent previous flareups , include subject‑reported onset date . The flareup must confirm physician screening via telephone contact and/or videoconferencing . Females childbearing potential ( FOCBP ) must negative blood ( urine ) pregnancy test ( sensitivity least 50 mIU/mL ) prior administration palovarotene . Male FOCBP subject must agree remain abstinent treatment 1 month treatment , sexually active , use two highly effective method birth control 1 month treatment . Additionally , sexually active FOCBP subject must already use two highly effective method birth control 1 month treatment start . Specific risk use retinoids pregnancy , agreement remain abstinent use two highly effective method birth control clearly define informed consent , subject legally authorize representative ( eg , parent , caregiver , legal guardian ) must specifically sign section . Subjects must accessible treatment palovarotene followup . For study enrollment Any reason , opinion Investigator , would lead inability subject and/or family comply protocol . For treatment palovarotene subsequent flareups : Weight &lt; 20 kg . The flareup completely ankylose joint . Intercurrent nonhealed fracture location . If currently use vitamin A beta carotene , multivitamins contain vitamin A beta carotene , herbal preparation , fish oil , unable unwilling discontinue use product palovarotene treatment . Exposure synthetic oral retinoids past 30 day prior screen ( signature inform consent ageappropriate subject assent ) . Concurrent treatment tetracycline tetracycline derivative due potential increase risk pseudotumor cerebri History allergy hypersensitivity retinoids lactose . Female subject breastfeed . Subjects uncontrolled cardiovascular , hepatic , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , endocrine , metabolic , ophthalmologic , immunologic , psychiatric , clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding , significant disease . Simultaneous participation another interventional clinical research study within past 4 week ( except Study PVO1A202 ) . Subjects experience suicidal ideation ( type 4 5 ) suicidal behavior within past month prior Screening define Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale . Any reason , opinion Investigator , would lead inability subject and/or family comply protocol .</criteria>
