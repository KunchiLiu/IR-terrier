	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety performance MANTA Vascular Closure Device ( VCD ) close arteriotomy follow percutaneous cardiovascular procedure utilize large bore sheaths purpose support CE Mark ( Conformite Europeenne -- '' European Conformity '' ) regulatory submission . The study ass whether MANTA VCD safe performs intend large-bore vascular closure interventional procedure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study Evaluate Safety Performance MANTA Vascular Closure Device</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate safety performance MANTA achieve hemostasis femoral arterial access sit patient undergo percutaneous transcatheter interventional procedure use 10-18F procedure sheath ( Transcather Aortic Valve Replacement ( TAVR ) , Balloon Aortic Valvuloplasty ( BAV ) Endovascular Aneurysm Repair ( EVAR ) ) purpose obtain CE Mark European Union . The study evaluate hemostasis success , time hemostasis ambulation , treatment success , rate access-site-related complication comparison publish literature hemostasis technique close large bore puncture ( primarily , surgical closure suture-mediated percutaneous closure .</detailed_description>
