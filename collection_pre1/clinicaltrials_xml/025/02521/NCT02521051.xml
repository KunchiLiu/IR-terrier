	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate two drug , alectinib bevacizumab , possible treatment Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer ( NSCLC ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I/II Trial Alectinib Bevacizumab Patients With Advanced , Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase ( ALK ) -Positive , Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I/II clinical trial . - A Phase I clinical trial test safety investigational intervention also try define appropriate dose ( ) investigational intervention use study . - Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . - `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . - In research study , investigator investigate combination two study drug : alectinib bevacizumab . The FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) approve alectinib treatment disease . It find people NSCLC change ( mutation ) certain gene call anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase ( ALK ) gene . This mutated gene help cancer cell grow . -- Alectinib belongs class drug design inhibit ALK . This drug use research study . Information research study suggest alectinib may effective kill cancer cell change ALK . Only participant change ALK gene allow participate study . In research study , Alectinib combine Bevacizumab . -- Bevacizumab ( also call Avastin ) work slow stop growth cell cancer tumor decrease blood supply tumor . If blood supply decrease , oxygen nutrient need tumor growth decrease . The FDA approve Bevacizumab treatment option disease The purpose study test safety Alectinib Bevacizumab . The investigator also determine effective combination participant advance , ALK-positive NSCLC focus participant brain metastasis .</detailed_description>
