	<brief_summary>Atypical hemolytic syndrome ( aHUS ) severe renal disease affect child adult . It characterize occlusion intrarenal vessel due presence platelet/fibrin thrombus , lead end-stage renal disease 2/3 patient . The discovery complement alternative pathway major risk factor aHUS lead design disease-specific treatment , anti-C5 monoclonal antibody , eculizumab . Complement inhibition use eculizumab clearly improved renal outcome aHUS patient dramatic decrease risk end-stage renal disease . However , optimal duration eculizumab therapy still debate . The present study aim assess feasibility safety discontinuation eculizumab treatment child adult aHUS .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Assessing Algorithm-based Strategy Eculizumab Discontinuation Children Adults With aHUS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A visit ( physical examination ; blood pressure measurement ) perform every month 3 month , every 3 month 21 month . Blood ( serum creatinine , platelet count , hemoglobin , LDH , haptoglobin ) urine ( proteinuria/creatininuria ratio microscopic hematuria ) test perform every 2 week inclusion M6 subsequently every month start M7 Urine dipstick ( albuminuria microscopic hematuria ) perform patient home least twice week . Markers complement activation biomarkers endothelial cell activation immune cell activation assess baseline , M1 , M3 , M6 , M9 , M12 , M18 M24 .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Children adults eculizumab treatment aHUS ( initial episode relapse ) define least two follow : thrombocytopenia ( platelet count &lt; 150 G/L ) , mechanical hemolytical anaemia ( Hb &lt; 10 g : dl , LDH &gt; upper limit normal , undetectable haptoglobin , presence schizocytes blood smear ) , acute kidney injury ( serum creatinine and/or proteinuria/creatininuria &gt; upper limit normal age increase &gt; 15 % compare baseline level ) 2 . Patients require dialysis . 3 . Adults : HUS remission normal stabilized renal function eculizumab treatment since least 6 month ( 3 month patient MCP mutation ) 4 . Children : age &gt; 3 year eculizumab withdrawal ; HUS remission normal renal function eculizumab treatment since least 3 month child isolate MCP mutation , least 6 month child complement mutation MCP . 1 . Patients dialysis . 2 . Women treat eculizumab start planning pregnancy . Pregnancy include postpartum period highrisk period occurrence aHUS . 3 . Patients give informed consent . 4 . Patients protection judicial authority Patients enrol study within ten week Eculizumab stop .</criteria>
