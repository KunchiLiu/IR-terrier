	<brief_summary>Cervical incompetence complicates approximately 1 500 pregnancy . Those woman cervical incompetence risk second trimester spontaneous abortion preterm labor . Cervical cerclage reduces risk must perform general neuraxial anesthesia . Some anesthesiologist prefer neuraxial anesthesia , reduce fetal exposure medication avoid risk associate loss maternal airway reflex general anesthesia . Spinal anesthesia , particular , added advantage technically simple still provide rapid , dense sensory block . For cerclage placement , patient require sensory block T10 S4 dermatome order cover sensation cervix well vagina perineum . Patients present cerclage spinal anesthesia pose dose challenge give physiologic change associate pregnancy . As woman progress pregnancy , require low dos intrathecal local anesthetic achieve similar block level . Multiple study demonstrate change start second trimester . Inadequate sensory coverage spinal anesthetic typically necessitate conversion general anesthesia , cause additional time waste added risk patient fetus . Anecdotally , reason anesthesiologist choose general anesthesia patient undergoing cerclage spinal anesthetic . As currently literature determine correct dosage patient , propose dose-response study determine ED90 intrathecal lidocaine adequate anesthesia elective cervical cerclage placement.The finding study help determine minimum dose intrathecal lidocaine necessary provide adequate spinal anesthesia cervical cerclage 90 % woman . This help decrease frequency inadequate anesthesia cervical cerclage .</brief_summary>
