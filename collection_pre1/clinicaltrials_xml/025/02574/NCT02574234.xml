	<brief_summary>No successful strategy propose patient submit important surgery reduce incidence postoperative cognitive disorder ( POCD ) onset . This project propose measure plasma level apelin wide population submit orthopedic surgery . Apelin could involve anti-inflammatory process . Apelin level surgery correlate postoperative cognitive disorder symptom measure PET-Scan could important predictive diagnostic marker adapt therapeutic strategy fight postoperative cognitive disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>It clearly show important surgery general anesthesia could strongly associate postoperative cognitive disorder month intervention especially elderly . No strategy really efficient fight phenomenon could lead Alzheimer disease development . In order prognosticate characterize potential risk develop cognitive trouble surgery , study propose evaluate potential predictive capacity apelin cohort young old adult undergo orthopedic surgery . Apelin peptide involve different physiological well physiopathological pathway . This peptide , involve osteogenesis inflammatory process , also describe neuroprotective . Yet , hippocampic neuroinflammation relate case postoperative cognitive disorder human well mice model surgery . Taken together , result seem indicate apelin could therapeutic target predictive postoperative cognitive disorder onset . This study measure plasma apelin level young old adult one day program orthopedic surgery . Moreover , correlate apelin amount inflammation process , protocol quantify inflammatory cytokine plasma ( IL6 , IL1 , TNFα ) . These result compare measure brain b-amyloid deposit assess PET-Scan technology . The follow-up patient do 3 month order evaluate postoperative cognitive disorder cognitive trouble associate surgery ( memory fail , decrease cognitive reserve… ) .</detailed_description>
