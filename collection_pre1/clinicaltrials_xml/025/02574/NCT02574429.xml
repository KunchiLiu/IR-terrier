Additionally , many PTSD research study exclude individual BPD due complexity concern regard risk . This study aim investigate effectiveness Cognitive-Processing Therapy Group ( evidenced-based treatment PTSD ) individual co-occurring disorder follow completion Dialectical Behavioural Therapy Program ( evidenced-based treatment BPD ) .

	<detailed_description>Borderline personality disorder ( BPD ) severe psychological disorder characterize instability emotion regulation , interpersonal relationship , self-image , couple marked impulsivity . Additionally , individual BPD often meet criterion disorder . One commonly co-occurring disorder among individual diagnose BPD posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . Within population , 56 % 58 % inpatient , 36 % 50 % outpatient diagnose co-occurring PTSD . The high prevalence co-occurrence consistent study document severe traumatic experience ( include , limited , physical , sexual , emotional abuse , child adult ) commonly experienced individual diagnose BPD . Additionally , risk factor PTSD identify meta-analyses share strike commonality BPD , include : lack social support , prior history trauma ( include childhood abuse ) , poor psychological adjustment prior trauma . The co-occurrence BPD/PTSD associate poor outcome significant distress presence either disorder alone . For example , individual co-occurring BPD/PTSD exhibit lower likelihood remission BPD 10 year follow-up , also likely engage non-suicidal self-injurious behavior ( NSSI ) . In addition , BPD patient diagnose PTSD also face great emotional dysfunction global psychological distress , well inferior physical health compare individual BPD alone . Several study propose theory high co-occurrence disorder , investigate potential treatment address unique issue associate comorbidity . The current standard treatment BPD , Dialectical Behaviour Therapy ( DBT ) , solid empirical basis , include numerous randomize control trial ( RCTs ) demonstrate efficacy reduction associate symptom . Despite efficacy DBT , DBT treatment manual ( Linehan , 1993 ) outline specific protocol intervention patient co-occurring BPD PTSD . Moreover , outcome DBT trial indicate DBT alone adequately treat co-occurring BPD/PTSD . Specifically , data RCT evaluate DBT suicidal woman BPD demonstrate 13 % patient diagnose BPD/PTSD achieve full remission PTSD one year DBT . Recently , researcher focus identify treat individual BPD PTSD within context DBT . Harned colleague develop test combined DBT PE protocol show efficacy treat BPD/PTSD . This combined treatment address problem inherent direct application conventional PTSD treatment , prolonged exposure ( PE ) therapy individual BPD . Evaluations PE show PE significantly reduce PTSD symptom secondary outcome depression . PE design counteract avoidance traumatic memory repeat exposure traumatic memory , well vivo exposure non-dangerous event perceive fearful patient . The intention treatment alleviate overestimation likelihood severity negative outcome , well condition fear response certain situation , often experienced PTSD patient . Several characteristic individual BPD interfere ability engage emotional exposure , central intervention PE therapy . These may include : self-injurious behaviour , co-occurring issue ( e.g . dissociation , substance use , ongoing trauma ) , emotional dysregulation ( over-engagement , under-engagement , strong non-fear emotion ) , trauma memory characteristic ( large quantity and/or poor quality trauma memory ) , treatment noncompliance . The combined DBT protocol include specific strategy address problem . While combined DBT/PE protocol important step towards address gap treatment individual co-occurring BPD/PTSD , evidenced-based intervention also merit evaluation combine DBT/PTSD treatment , notably Cognitive Processing Therapy ( CPT ) . Like PE , CPT strong evidence base support effectiveness treat PTSD . The protocol CPT initially generate treatment victim sexual assault since successfully use treat type trauma . It consist cognitive therapy focus traumatic event impact individual 's belief , others , world general . The treatment involve 12 session therapy , along homework session . The objective treatment first help patient identify dysfunctional belief assumption stem traumatic experience , challenge belief ( i.e. , `` stick point '' , develop new belief reflect broader perspective . While combined DBT/PE treatment encouraging , CPT may benefit similar , superior PE way . Research CPT indicate treatment similarly effective PE reduce PTSD symptom depression . However , respective impact secondary symptom may differ due different mechanism underlie treatment . For example , one study suggest CPT may superior PE specific scale guilt . One distinct benefit CPT available efficacious individual group format , whereas PE available individually . Group CPT allow efficient use resource , critical context publicly fund health-system . In light fact Standard DBT require extensive clinician resource , efficient use supplementary treatment even critical . Finally , may benefit group warrant research , include reduction stigma PTSD associate shame address within group context . This study aim assess efficacy CPT address PTSD symptom among individual co-occurring BPD/PTSD participate Standard DBT . It hypothesize individual show significant reduction primary symptom outcome ( PTSD ) secondary symptom outcome ( e.g. , BPD symptom , shame , anxiety , depression ) pre post- treatment . This study aim provide one first clinical examination effectiveness CPT treatment co-occurring BPD PTSD among individual participate Standard DBT . The result trial could lead establishment potentially clinically effective cost-effective alternative PE population , also elucidate mechanism behind complex comorbidity .</detailed_description>
