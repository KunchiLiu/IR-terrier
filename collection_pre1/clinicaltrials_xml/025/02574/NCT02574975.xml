	<brief_summary>Bronchial asthma common chronic respiratory disease . Patients usually manifest variable symptom ( short breath , chest tightness , cough , etc . ) variable airflow limitation often associate airway hyper-responsiveness airway inflammation . About 1-18 % global population suffer disease , cause huge economic burden patient country . Airway reactivity measurement important way diagnosis asthma . Methacholine ( Mch ) bronchial provocation test ( BPT ) `` gold standard '' determination airway reactivity , measure method ( like adenosine monophosphate ( AMP ) -BPT , leukotriene D4 ( LTD4 ) -BPT , Astograph-BPT , etc . ) also bring hot research field . The investigator ' purpose compare different kind methodology ( Mch , AMP , LTD4-BPT , Astograph-BPT ) assess airway responsiveness investigate treatment efficacy budesonide /formoterol asthmatic .</brief_summary>
