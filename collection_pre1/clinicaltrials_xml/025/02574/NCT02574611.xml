	<brief_summary>An injury spinal cord ( SCI ) result numerous medical complication , include gastrointestinal ( GI ) function . Individuals SCI may experience severe constipation ( prolonged stool retention ) , incontinence ( accident ) , overall difficulty bowel evacuation . While various treatment medication establish address complication , little knowledge relate overall colonic motility . However , new technology High Resolution Colonic Manometry allow physician visualize high pressure contraction inside colon , lead great understanding typical motility , accurate diagnosis , effective treatment . In study , investigator propose use technology understand effect SCI colonic motility compare normal colonic function observe able-bodied ( AB ) individual . In addition , investigator plan study effect pharmacological treatment , neostigmine , promote peristaltic contraction colon deliver across skin .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use High Resolution Colonic Manometry Studying Motility</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator data suggests fundamental consequence SCI slow intestinal peristaltic activity , likely result regulation parasympathetic neural pathway . Furthermore , investigator effectively show measure involve increase parasympathetic stimulation result efficient bowel evacuation improve bowel care . Such measure include administration neostigmine ( NEO ) , increase peristaltic contraction colon , result predictable bowel evacuation . Given cardiopulmonary side-effects NEO , ant-cholinergic know Glycopyrrolate ( GLY ) usually co-administered NEO reverse side effect . However , investigator knowledge regard effect SCI colonic motility still primitive , mainly due pervious technological disadvantage . New High Resolution Colonic Manometry system ( Medical Measurement Systems Dover , NH ) simultaneously capture high amplitude pressure contraction ( HAPCs ) across ascend , transverse , descend , recto-sigmoid colon . Such capability allow much clear display pressure event compare previous line trace manometric system direction contraction much easy discern well . To date , technology effective tool diagnose bowel disorder complication , constipation able-bodied individual ( AB ) . However , study conduct SCI population . This technology also potential capture effect NEO+GLY improve colonic function .</detailed_description>
