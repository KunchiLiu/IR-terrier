	<brief_title>Markers Predicting Risk Breast Cancer Women Different Races</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Evidence suggest , besides reduce access care , increase breast cancer incidence mortality AA ( African American ) compare EA ( European American Caucasian ) woman influence biology tumor . Gene methylation change cause environmental factor start birth one mechanism genetic non-genetic factor could affect development breast cancer could underlie disparity aggressiveness . The investigator first show panel gene hypermethylated specifically AA-ER-negative tumor young woman comparison EA-tumors woman age . Gene promoter methylation find low level healthy breast tissue woman without cancer . Race family history cancer increase likelihood early event . Thus , epigenetic change may early event transformation breast cell tumor formation . This study enroll woman different ethnic background undergo mastectomy order collect normal tumor tissue study genetic change breast cancer risk .</detailed_description>
