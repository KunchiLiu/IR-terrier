	<brief_summary>This open label Pilot study evaluate combination Vigil™ pembrolizumab patient incurable locally advanced metastatic melanoma . Patients undergo standard care surgical procedure ( e.g. , tumor biopsy , palliative resection ) meeting procurement eligibility criterion may tumor harvest Vigil™ vaccine manufacture . This study evaluate hypothesis vaccination Vigil™ induce cancer-specific T cell immunity patient . Addition pembrolizumab Vigil™ treat patient augment immune change sequential biopsy compare post-Vigil™ pre-PD-1 inhibitor post-PD-1 inhibitor biopsy , combination therapy associate reduction tumor volume clinical exam and/or imaging .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This open label Pilot study evaluate combination Vigil™ autologous tumor cell immunotherapy pembrolizumab PD-1 inhibitor patient incurable locally advanced metastatic melanoma . Patients undergo standard care surgical procedure ( e.g. , tumor biopsy , palliative resection ) meeting procurement eligibility criterion may tumor harvest Vigil™ vaccine manufacture . Patients subsequently meet study enrollment criterion include manufacture minimum 4 dos Vigil™ agreement provide treatment tumor biopsy receive ( ) Vigil™ 1 x 10e7 cell intradermal Days 1 , 15 , 29 , 43 every 3 week thereafter 9 total dos Vigil™ ( ii ) pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg IV start Day 43 every 3 week thereafter 6 month study enrollment . Day 1 study treatment must within 6 week tumor procurement . Tumor biopsy peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) correlative study obtain baseline ( tumor procurement ) , Week 7 Week 16 study . PBMCs also collect Week 1 ( pre-Vigil™ ) end treatment ( EOT ) . Radiological assessment tumor immune relate Response Criteria ( irRC ) RECIST criterion obtain screen ( tumor procurement ) Week 13 EOT . The primary study objective characterize compare CD8+ T cell density , PD-1+ T cell density , PD-L1 expression tumor biopsy baseline , follow 3 dos ( approximately 6 week ) single agent Vigil™ follow 3 dos pembrolizumab . Secondary study objective include evaluation tolerability safety combination , determine compare IFNγ-ELISPOT result pre-procurement , screening , single agent Vigil™ , Vigil™ plus pembrolizumab combination . Additional study objective include determine best ORR irRC criterion .</detailed_description>
