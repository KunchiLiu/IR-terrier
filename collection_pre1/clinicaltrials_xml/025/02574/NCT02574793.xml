	<brief_title>Glycemic Fluctuations Newly Diagnosed Growth Hormone-Secreting Pituitary Adenoma Cushing Syndrome Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Glucose fluctuation present patient diabetes mellitus also subject normal glucose tolerance impair glucose regulation . Compared traditional monitoring method , continuous glucose monitor system ( CGMS ) techniques provide much detail understanding shift blood glucose level throughout day.It consider reliable evaluate glucose variability patient diabetes also nondiabetic individual . People Growth Hormone-Secreting Pituitary Adenoma Cushing Syndrome risk impair glucose metabolism develop diabetes mellitus.Some researcher show 15-30 % Growth Hormone-Secreting Pituitary Adenoma suffer diabetes , 15-36 % impaired glucose regulation . The rate Cushing Syndrome individual 10-30 % 40-45 % separately . Glycemic variability poorly study nondiabetic individual study newly diagnose Growth Hormone-Secreting Pituitary Adenoma Cushing Syndrome individual . In study CGM use dynamically monitor patient newly diagnose Growth Hormone-Secreting Pituitary Adenoma Cushing Syndrome .</detailed_description>
