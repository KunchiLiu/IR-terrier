	<brief_summary>The ability encode speech signal determined ascend descend auditory processing . Difficulties process speech signal well described behavioral level specific language disorder . However , little known underlie pathophysiological mechanism . The assumption observe degradation signal provide ear deaf subject case specific language impairment would phonemic disorder ( possibly link processing disorder auditory ) . The two population group therefore different abnormality central auditory process - could modify target remediation group .</brief_summary>
