	<brief_summary>In Chile , 1 4 pregnant woman obese ( BMI &gt; 30 kg/m2 ) . This impact negatively health mother offspring pregnancy . Lifestyle intervention primary prevention strategy gestational diabetes obese woman ; however , intervention show null limited effectiveness . In animal , n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid ( n3LC-PUFAs ) show increase insulin sensitivity high production secretion adipokines , enhance fatty acid oxidation , reduction lipogenesis , direct anti-inflammatory effect ; however evidence human pregnancy still limit . Combining lifestyle intervention n3LC-PUFAs supplementation could enhance metabolic control obese pregnant woman . Objective : assess effectiveness two prenatal nutritional intervention ( home-based diet physical activity counsel and/or n3LC-PUFAs supplementation ) deliver obese pregnant woman achieve good metabolic control mother ( low incidence gestational diabetes mellitus ) offspring ( low incidence macrosomia low prevalence insulin resistance birth ) . Methods : study cluster-randomized trial obese pregnant woman 12 primary health care center ( PHCC ) stratify socio-economic status ( SES ) randomize one four parallel study arm . We recruit 1000 woman allocate : 1 Home-based Diet physical activity ( PA ) plus n3LC-PUFAs supplementation ( Intervention Group 1 , n=250 ) ; 2 . Routine diet &amp; PA counseling care plus n3LC-PUFAs supplementation ( Intervention Group 2 , n=250 ) ; 3 . Home-based Diet Physical activity plus placebo n3LC-PUFA supplementation ( Intervention Group 3 , n=250 ) ; 4 . Routine diet &amp; PA counseling plus placebo ( Control Group , n=250 ) . Expected result : expect intervention contribute achieve good metabolic control pregnancy . Ultimately , expect study contribute advance understand develop implement effective action promote healthy pregnancy therefore , healthy live mother offspring .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diet Physical Activity Counseling n3-long Chain ( PUFA ) Supplementation Obese Pregnant Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Obesity relate non-communicable chronic disease ( NCDs : cardiovascular disease , cancer diabetes ) represent main cause death disability Chile well worldwide . They account important proportion health-care cost loss productivity , overload country 's economy , particularly develop country . From population perspective , clear prevent emergence condition effective approach ; however current policy fail incorporate scientific knowledge thus , effective sustainable . There compel evidence although obesity NCDs mainly observe adulthood , risk condition originate first 1000-days life ( i.e . pregnancy two year old ) . Maternal lifestyle condition pregnancy ( e.g . maternal obesity ) could affect future maternal health , also risk NCDs next generation . Therefore , pregnancy critical window implementation NCDs prevention strategy . Most intervention diet physical activity ( PA ) pregnancy focus decrease gestational weight gain ( GWG ) . Recent meta-analyses intervention demonstrate lifestyle intervention pregnancy positive effect GWG . Beyond lifestyle intervention , dietary intervention propose probiotic , vitamin D n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid ( n3LC-PUFAs ) supplementation . Regarding n3LC-PUFAs , difference plasma fatty acid profile woman gestational diabetes ( GDM ) woman without GDM suggest possible alteration fatty acid metabolism GDM . Data systematic review show consistent association marine algae oil supplementation high length gestation , improvement maternal mood neural development . Nonetheless , intervention diet PA focus metabolic control obese woman impact consistent . Additionally , intervention study explore effect n3LC-PUFAs supplementation pregnant woman incidence GDM , study conduct obese pregnant woman . Therefore , combine n3LC-PUFAs supplementation lifestyle intervention could enhance metabolic control obese pregnant woman . We propose evaluate effect n3LC-PUFAs supplementation intervention among obese pregnant woman ( independently combine diet physical activity intervention ) metabolic control mother offspring . In 2013 start 12 primary health clinic ( PHCC ) South East area Santiago Chile cluster randomize trial -the Chilean Maternal &amp; Infant Nutrition Cohort Study ( CHiMINCs ) - aim improve weight control pregnancy offspring growth infancy enhance PHCC 's maternal infant weight monitor system well promote breastfeed . In current study propose expand effort try optimize metabolic control obese pregnant woman offspring combine home-based diet physical activity counsel n3LC-PUFAs supplementation . Women seek prenatal care 12 select PHCC &lt; 14 week gestation first prenatal visit ; body mass index ( BMI ) &gt; 30 Kg/m2 first prenatal visit ; singleton pregnancy ask participate . We recruit 1000 woman ; 250 woman per arm study . After randomization , obese pregnant woman intervention group 1 receive home-based Diet &amp; Physical activity ( PA ) counsel plus n3LC-PUFAs oral supplementation base Schizochytrium oil ( S-oil ) contain 800 mg docosahexaenoic ( DHA ) acid/day , administer capsular preparation contain 200 mg DHA/capsule ( 4 capsules/day ) . Obese pregnant woman intervention group 2 receive standard education session include prenatal control PHCC home-based counseling session , plus n3LC-PUFAs supplementation 800 mg DHA . Obese pregnant woman intervention group 3 receive home-based diet &amp; PA counseling session plus n3LC-PUFAs placebo consist S-oil contain 200 mg DHA/day . Placebo administer capsular preparation contain 50 mg DHA/capsule ( 4 capsules/day ) , give evidence suggests would unethical provide DHA pregnancy . Placebo deliver way n3LC-PUFA supplementation . The control group receive routine diet &amp; PA PHCC counseling session plus placebo ( 4 capsule 50 mg DHA per day ) . Measurements collect baseline ( &lt; 14 week pregnancy ) , mid-pregnancy ( 24-28 week ) , delivery . Baseline 24-28 week measurement carry home . Analyses do accord `` intention-to-treat '' ( i.e . effectiveness approach ) `` per protocol '' ( i.e . efficacy approach ) principle . In accordance 2×2 factorial design , diet &amp; PA intervention ( Intervention Groups 1 3 ) compare routine care intervention ( Intervention Groups 2 Control Group ) n3LC-PUFAs supplementation intervention ( Intervention Groups 1 2 ) compare placebo ( Intervention Group 3 Control Group ) . To evaluate effect two combined intervention outcomes 3 intervene group compare outcome control group . We expect intervention contribute achieve good metabolic control pregnancy . Ultimately , expect study contribute advance understand develop implement effective action promote healthy pregnancy therefore , healthy live mother offspring .</detailed_description>
