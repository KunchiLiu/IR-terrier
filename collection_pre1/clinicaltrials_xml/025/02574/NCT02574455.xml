	<detailed_description>This international , multi-center , open-label , randomize , Phase III study patient metastatic TNBC refractory relapse least 2 prior chemotherapy ( include taxane ) metastatic disease . Earlier adjuvant neoadjuvant treatment limited disease allow , include `` least two prior therapy '' count . The primary objective study compare efficacy sacituzumab govitecan treatment physician 's choice ( TPC ) measure progression-free survival ( PFS ) patient metastatic TNBC previously treat least two systemic chemotherapy regimen . The secondary objective study compare two treatment group : - Overall Survival ( OS ) - Independently-determined Objective Response Rate ( ORR ) , duration response time onset response per RECIST 1.1 criterion - Quality life - Safety ( adverse event , safety laboratory , incidence dose delay dose reduction , treatment discontinuation due adverse event ) Exploratory objective include exposure-response analysis efficacy ( PFS OS ) safety ( incidence Grade 3-5 adverse event , relate UGT1A1 endpoint ) . Three-hundred twenty-eight ( 328 ) patient anticipate enrolled . Approximately 100 institution participate study , include site North America Europe . Clinical site use standard ASCO/CAP criterion pathological diagnosis TNBC , define negative estrogen receptor ( ER ) , progesterone receptor ( PR ) human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 ( HER2 ) . Receptor result base local assessment recent biopsy finding ( pathology report ) . HER2 negative define one following : 0 1+ immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) , IHC 2+ , fluorescence situ hybridization ( FISH ) ratio HER2 gene : chromosome 17 less 2 , per standard guideline . ER- PR-negative define &lt; 1 % cell express hormonal receptor IHC , per standard guideline . TNBC status review centrally result require prior determine eligibility . BRCA 1 &amp; 2 mutational status collect , know . Baseline serum biomarkers ( CA15-3 , CA27-29 , CEA ) measure . A single whole-blood sample also collect patient determination UGT1A1 genotype retrospective assessment predict toxicity . The Sponsor request slide prior ( archive ) biopsy surgical specimen , particularly immunohistology documentation tumor Trop-2 expression appropriate tumor marker , include topoisomerase 1 ; however , result require prior determine eligibility . Patients meet eligibility randomize 1:1 receive either sacituzumab govitecan treatment physician choice ( TPC ) , need select prior randomization one 4 allow regimen . Randomization stratify number prior chemotherapy advance disease ( 2-3 v &gt; 3 ) geographical location ( North America v Europe ) . Patients treated progression , unacceptable toxicity , study withdrawal , death , whichever come first . Tumor progression lead treatment withdrawal assess investigator . Starting initial dose sacituzumab govitecan TPC , CT scan ( MRI contrast allergic ) obtain least every 8 week occurrence progression disease require discontinuation treatment . All image evaluate locally study site tumor status per RECIST1.1 . Confirmatory CT/MRI scan obtain patient within 4 6 week initial partial response . Additional CT MRI scan may perform discretion physician ass disease status medically indicate . Other study procedure treatment include quality life questionnaire , physical examination vital sign , CBC ( differential platelet count ) , routine serum chemistry , serum sample level sacituzumab govitecan , anti-drug antibody ( HAHA ) , concomitant medication , adverse event . ( See Study Procedures ) . A final study visit conduct 4 week last dose sacituzumab govitecan TPC patient discontinue study participation unless early termination require . The reason study discontinuation document adverse event abnormal laboratory time follow resolution stabilization . No crossover sacituzumab govitecan treatment allow discontinue treatment TPC arm , otherwise restriction subsequent therapy patient may receive discontinue study . All patient , include prematurely terminate study participation , follow every 4 week first year every 8 week thereafter survival follow-up . This may telephone include documentation anti-cancer therapy may receive . Survival status may also document public database . The use prophylactic antipyretic , antihistamine , antiemetic , sedative corticosteroids regularly require sacituzumab govitecan thus use medically necessary . The use medication patient receive TPC discretion treat physician , must recorded.All patient study receive best supportive care , include use growth factor blood transfusion , continue initiate use corticosteroid , palliative medication complication disease ( include medication pain dietary support ) , treatment active infection , palliative external radiation therapy bone metastasis , medication ongoing medical conditions.The use anti-cancer treatment ( besides IMMU-132 TPC ) permit study . However , palliative and/or supportive medication bone-modifying medication ( bisphosphonates denosumab ) , and/or procedure radiation surgery allow investigator 's discretion . After discontinue study , patient may receive sacituzumab govitecan ; otherwise , restriction subsequent therapy intervention patient may receive . Any anti-cancer therapy document . A 67 % improvement PFS relapsed/refractory metastatic TNBC patient population would consider clinically meaningful . PFS estimate patient population vary 1.7 4.2 month ( 3 month average ) . For estimate median PFS 3 month control TPC group , 1:1 randomization 67 % improvement median PFS IMMU-132 group 3 5 month ( correspond hazard ratio 0.6 ) , total sample size 328 patient ( 305 event ) equally randomize two arm would achieve 99 % power two-sided type 1 error rate 5 % , base accrual rate 18.2 patient per month ( 18-month enrollment period ) minimum follow-up 9 month . For secondary endpoint overall survival , enrollment 328 patient ( 204 expect event ) , two-sided 5 % type 1 error rate , study 82.5 % power detect increase overall survival 10 month control arm 15 month IMMU-132 arm ( correspond hazard ratio 0.67 ) .</detailed_description>
