	<detailed_description>According WHO ( World Health Organization ) stress become worldwide epidemic consider disease century , attain people different age occupation . Stress define pressure tension , physical , mental emotional type , overwhelm individual adversely affect performance physical intellectual function . When stress prolong , immune system affect , leave body subject disease premature age . Among psychophysiological reaction associate excessive stress chronic fatigue , ulcer , depression , hypertension heart attack . In light consequence , important measure take early identify symptom stress , allow people properly treat resume normal activity . The study present literature suggest possibility use biological signal indicator presence stress . In study , certain physiological variable measure related stress individual . However , previous study focus acute stress , mean short-lived . The objective study relate certain physiological indicator presence chronic stress , ie long-lasting often perceive individual . To end , investigator perform measurement blood pressure value , skin temperature , galvanic skin response heart rate variability , compare result provide ISSL ( Lipp 's Inventory Stress Symptoms Adults ) , PSS ( Perceived Stress Scale ) SRRS ( Social Readjustment Rating Scale ) , stress condition individual . The heart rate variability check time frequency domain . All physiological signal monitor non-invasive non-intrusive sensor totally safe participant . To investigate relationship physiological variable exist chronic stress condition investigator use algorithm analysis biological signal base Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network Backpropagation Algorithm ( MLP ) Principal Components Analysis ( PCA ) . To evaluate performance classifier identification chronic stress investigator check indicator precision , sensitivity , specificity accuracy . The result analyze Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves ( ROC ) . Ethical approval obtain Local Ethics Committee ( CAAE-28201014.2.0000.5497 ) participant . They inform methodology confidentiality personal information . All procedure perform write informed consent participant . Data collection complete October 2014 .</detailed_description>
