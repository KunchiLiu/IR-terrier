	<brief_summary>This phase II open-label randomize clinical trial MK-3475 ( Pembrolizumab ) previously treat PDL1 positive non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) patient . This drug show allow partial response accord immune-related response criterion response evaluation criterion solid tumor ( RECIST ) . The main endpoint compare overall response rate ( ORR ) MK-3475 docetaxel docetaxel alone patient advance NSCLC .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>MK-3475 ( MK-3475 ) IgG4 monoclonal antibody PD1 , receive 'breakthrough therapy ' designation advance melanoma FDA January 2013 . Preliminary result NSCLC cohort phase I dose expansion trial MK-3475 present 2013 World Conference Lung Cancer meeting . MK-3475 administer intravenously every three week , continue disease progression base upon immune relate response criterion ( irRC ) unacceptable toxicity . IrRC take account potential different pattern response see immunotherapy . Of 38 patient previously treat advanced NSCLC evaluable efficacy , 9 ( 24 percent ) achieve least partial response irRC . Standard oncology criterion response ( Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors , RECIST available 33 patient , least partial response seven patient ( 21 percent ) . Median overall survival 51 week . Therapy well tolerate , one case pneumonitis ( grade 2 ) one case pulmonary edema ( grade 3 ) report . Tumor PDL1 expression ( assessed different assay use trial evaluate Nivolumab MPDL3280A ; antibody use undisclosed ) available 33 patient irRC assessment 29 standard oncology ( RECIST ) assessment . Of 9 patient PDL1 positivity irRC response data , 6 achieve least partial response ( 67 percent ) ; 7 patient PDL1 positivity standard oncology response data , 4 achieve response ( 57 percent ) . Of note , 1 24 patient PDL1 negativity achieve response irRC ; 2 22 patient PDL1 negativity response standard oncology criterion ( RECIST ) . Based upon result , randomized phase II trial compare MK-3475 standard salvage docetaxel patient PDL1 positive advance NSCLC launch ( NCT01905657 ) , however study synergistic activity Docetaxel + MK-3475 evaluate , could open possibility use drug concurrently Docetaxel standard therapy patient progression disease despite double platinum-based regimen . Measure expression level PD1/PD-L1/PD-L2 subpopulation tumor cell patient NSCLC come clinic National Cancer Institute relevant way , associate role forecast potential biomarker , relate PD-L1 level clinicopathologic characteristic patient study .</detailed_description>
