	<brief_summary>To achieve adequate visual work field laparoscopic colorectal surgery without disturbance small intestine , patient position Trendelenburg position . This position result hemodynamic change may increase risk cardiopulmonary complication prolong hospital stay . Recently , intraoperative retractor sponge introduce alternative Trendelenburg position laparoscopic surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial Retractor SPONGE Evaluation Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : To study impact use intraoperative retractor sponge duration hospital stay risk perioperative complication patient undergo laparoscopic surgery colorectal cancer . Study design : Randomized controlled trial , nest within prospective cohort accord 'cohort multiple randomize controlled trial ' ( cmRCT ) design ( clinicaltrials.gov NCT02070146 ) . Study population : Patients colorectal cancer undergo laparoscopic sigmoid rectal resection , give informed consent offer experimental intervention within prospective cohort . Patient require open surgery patient benign colorectal disease exclude study . Intervention : Intraoperative use retractor sponge versus usual care , i.e . Trendelenburg position . Main study parameters/endpoints : The primary endpoint hospital stay . Secondary objective operation time , blood-loss , fluid balance , body temperature , oxygen therapy postoperative complication . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : The study conduct accord cohort multiple Randomized Controlled Trial ( cmRCT ) design . Within PLCRC cohort , identify patient eligible experimental intervention give informed consent invite future experimental intervention . From sub cohort , randomly select group patient offer surgery use retractor sponge , accept decline . Eligible patient sub cohort randomly select undergo standard treatment , i.e . surgery Trendelenburg position . We expect adverse event patient intervention arm .</detailed_description>
