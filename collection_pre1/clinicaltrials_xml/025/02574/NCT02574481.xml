	<detailed_description>Atherosclerosis systemic disease become increasingly recognize expand elderly population significant cause morbidity mortality . Atherosclerosis vessel low extremity cause variety symptom range intermittent claudication ischemic rest pain critical ischemia major tissue loss . Typically , femoropopliteal lesion difficult successfully treat endovascular therapy disease often diffuse locate area body subject significant mobility stress extension , contraction , compression , elongation , flexion torsion . The IMPERIAL trial global , prospective , multi-center trial . Approximately 525-535 subject enrol 75 study center worldwide . Regions participate include United States , Canada , European Union , Japan New Zealand . The trial consist prospective , multicenter , 2:1 randomize ( ELUVIA v Zilver PTX ) , control , single-blind , non-inferiority trial ( RCT ) , concurrent , non-blinded , non-randomized , single-arm , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) substudy concurrent , non-blinded , non-randomized , Long Lesion substudy .</detailed_description>
