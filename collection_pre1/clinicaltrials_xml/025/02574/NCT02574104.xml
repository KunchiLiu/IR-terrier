	<brief_title>Generalizing TESTPILOT New Single Family Room NICUs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Prior open nation 's large single family room NICU 2009 , Women &amp; Infants Hospital develop TESTPILOT : Transportable Enhanced Simulation Technologies Pre-Implementation Limited Operations Testing . The investigator simulate functional NICU . 164 latent safety threat ( LST ) identify without expose single neonate risk . Practical change make ) verbal write communication protocol , b ) admission workflows , c ) rapid team response , ) family center care e ) scripting , f ) facility , g ) supply equipment , h ) staff train issue . `` Generalizing TESTPILOT '' study learnable applicable simulation-based methodology institution . Six institution successfully implement TESTPILOT-NICU 2015 . The investigator hypothesize implementation succeed across spectrum care delivery structure , simulation experience magnitudes culture change , result broad blueprint integrate simulation transition healthcare service . Our goal include : 1 . Share lesson learn support local simulation team preparation ; 2 . Quantitatively demonstrate improvement system readiness staff preparedness institution 3 . Assess saturation latent safety threat successive TESTPILOT implementation , result blueprint similar transition . During Phase I investigator standardize , refine validated survey instrument NICU staff process expert . Phase II include implementation TESTPILOT 15 institution three year . The Principal Investigator recruit institution guide methodology , typically last six eight month . Each institution 's Co-Investigator core simulation team recruit local staff simulation , LST discovery resolution , survey completion .</detailed_description>
