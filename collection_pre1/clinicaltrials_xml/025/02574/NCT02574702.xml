	<brief_summary>1 . Introduction : The common complication loop ileostomy closure rectal cancer patient undergo low anterior rectum resection , superficial surgical site infection ( incidence 2-40 % ) . There various technique relate close loop ileostomy . In retrospective study center , investigator objectify superficial surgical site infection rate reduce half application contralateral drainage ( Penrose ® ) primary loop ileostomy closure . 2 . Objectives Hypothesis : Hypothesis : The application contralateral drainage ( Penrose ® ) primary loop ileostomy closure ( carrier loop ileostomy low anterior rectum resection rectal cancer ) reduce superficial surgical site infection . Main objective : To reduce rate superficial surgical site infection application contralateral drainage ( Penrose ® ) surgical wound primary loop ileostomy closure . 3 . Methodology : Prospective randomize clinical trial effectiveness contralateral Penrose® drainage implementation patient primary loop ileostomy ( low anterior rectum resection ) closure able know investigator reduce superficial surgical site infection rate . Monitorization 30 day surgery</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction : The common complication loop ileostomy closure rectal cancer patient undergo low anterior rectum resection , superficial surgical site infection ( incidence 2-40 % ) . In literature various technique relate close loop ileostomy try reduce rate infection record . In retrospective study center , investigator objectify superficial surgical site infection rate reduce half application contralateral drainage ( Penrose ® ) primary loop ileostomy closure . 2 . Objectives Hypothesis : Hypothesis : The application contralateral drainage ( Penrose ® ) primary loop ileostomy closure ( carrier loop ileostomy low anterior rectum resection rectal cancer ) reduce superficial surgical site infection . Main objective : To reduce rate superficial surgical site infection application contralateral drainage ( Penrose ® ) surgical wound primary loop ileostomy closure . Secondary objective : - Identify risk factor associate superficial surgical site infection relation primary loop ileostomy closure ( without drainage ) . - Reducing hospital stay care home . 3 . Methodology : Prospective randomize clinical trial effectiveness contralateral Penrose® drainage implementation patient primary loop ileostomy ( low anterior rectum resection ) closure able know investigator reduce superficial surgical site infection rate . It use simple randomization . To assess occurrence superficial incisional infection , investigator monitor patient till 30 day surgery</detailed_description>
