	<brief_title>A Study Assess ARI-3037MO Hepatic Fat Metabolism Patients With Dysglycemia Evidence Hepatic Steatosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled study enroll 36 men woman diagnosis NAFLD orNASH . The study conduct period approximately 28 wks include : Screening Phase ( Days -14to -1 ) ; 24-week long Treatment Phase , patient randomly assign receive ARI-3037MO placebo ; End-of-study Visit ( ESV ) schedule 2 wks end Treatment Phase The Screening Phase include 2 visit . Visit 1 : There initial assessment patient 's eligibility participation study . A complete medical history obtain prospective study patient undergo physical examination laboratory evaluation . For patient liver biopsy 6months prior Visit 1 , histology finding , i.e. , NAS , steatosis score fibrosis score record . Visit 2 : Approximately 1 week Visit 1 , result clinical laboratory screen test result review Principal Investigator ( PI ) , patient contact advise eligibility continue study . Eligible patient undergo liver magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) ass intrahepatic fat content . Treatment Phase Patients MRI result show intrahepatic fat content ≥10 % enter Treatment Phase study . The Treatment Phase include 4 outpatient visit period 24 week . Visit 3 : Patients randomly assign receive ARI-3037MO placebo Day 1 24-week long outpatient treatment period . Baseline assessment , include FibroTest® , FibroScan® clinical laboratory test , perform , patient take study drug twice daily . Visits 4 , 5 6 : During Treatment Phase , patient visit study clinic 4 , 12 24 week ( ± 4 day ) Day 1 evaluation examination collect study drug . Twenty-four week start dose , end Treatment Phase , patient undergo follow-up MRI FibroScan† ass change baseline intrahepatic fat content liver fibrosis , respectively . †If FibroScan equipment available study site End-of-Study Visit Visit 7 : An ESV occur 2 week ( ± 4 day ) end Treatment Phase .</detailed_description>
