	<brief_title>The Ability Electronic Patient Symptom Reporting Reduce Symptom Burden During Hospitalization Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study compare peak symptom burden two study arm ( autologous transplant vs. allogeneic transplant ) . Peak symptom burden also compare two study arm within subgroup patient ( myeloablative vs. reduce intensity conditioning ) . Secondary outcome also compare two arm include : change patient-reported quality life , time supportive care treatment change , length hospital stay , thirty day readmission rate discharge , day alive hospital 100 day since admission , overall survival . Additionally , measure physical activity capture physiological monitoring order explore association patient-reported symptom measure . Patient clinician satisfaction also evaluate . In study , investigator use electronic survey assess 16 patient-reported symptom calculate symptom score may range 0-61 day . This symptom score represent symptom burden patient particular day . Symptom burden anticipate peak day 7 14 , investigator define peak symptom burden average symptom score day 7 , 10 14 . In arm , symptom assess day order compare peak burden .</detailed_description>
