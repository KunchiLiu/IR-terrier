	<brief_title>Study T-Regulatory Cells Asthma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator hypothesize increase asthma severity obese patient , least part , related defective number function regulatory T cell ( Tregs ) . That obese asthmatic subject defective Treg profile would augment inflammation asthma ( synergistic effect ) . Alternatively , Treg dysfunction obesity might affect asthma independently ( additive effect ) . To test hypothesis , investigator plan conduct observational control study compare Treg profile obese normal-weight individual without asthma . This exploratory study investigate following : 1 . To determine whether Treg number function differs obese normal-weight individual without asthma . 2 . To determine whether serum leptin level differ obese normal-weight individual without asthma .</detailed_description>
