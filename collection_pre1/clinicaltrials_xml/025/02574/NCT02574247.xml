	<detailed_description>The goal study determine impact auditory training program function inner ear auditory brainstem . In normal-hearing individual , medial olivocochlear ( MOC ) branch auditory efferent system appear aid hearing signal noise . A previous study young normal-hearing adult find auditory training strengthen function MOC system participant way coincide improvement perceive speech sound background noise . The MOC function measure baseline also predict amount success auditory training . Although result promising , know generalize population often hearing-in-noise problem old hearing-impaired adult . This study examine auditory train program impact MOC activity group old adult normal hear mild hearing loss . This prospective study utilize repeated-measures design . Participants participate computerized auditory training program take place 15 week . Transient-evoked otoacoustic emission ( TEOAEs ) use measure strength MOC activity visit . Performance untrained stimulus ( word sentence ) also measure . A control group ( auditory training ) also use establish test-retest reliability TEOAE measurement performance word sentence test . The result study may contribute improved diagnosis treatment hearing-in-noise problem Veterans civilian population . This single-site study take place Auditory Research Laboratory , locate VA Loma Linda Healthcare System ( VALLHS ) Loma Linda , CA . Veterans non-Veterans , male female , age 50 89 either normal hearing mild sensorineural hearing loss participate . Women minority encourage participate . Up 200 volunteer enrol study . Each eligible participant participate 12 study visit . Participants randomly assign priori either experimental group ( auditory training ) Control group ( auditory training ) use simple random assignment . Because study detect whether significant change MOC activity speech perception across time occur result auditory training , Control group need establish test-retest reliability outcome measure absence training . This study consist one experiment last 3 year total . Each participant participate 12 study visit , ideally 10-week period . However , allow visit take place across 15-week period account participant need miss reschedule visit . All study visit last 2-3 hour . Thus , maximum amount participation participant 36 hour across 15-week period . Standard-of-care screening experimental test carried double-walled sound-isolated audiometric chamber adjoin single-walled room Auditory Research Laboratory , locate VALLHS . Initial audiometric test use standard-of-care procedure conduct verify eligibility study carry use standard clinical equipment . Experimental test consist Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions ( TEOAE ) testing , word/sentence recognition testing , auditory training program ( participant Experimental group undergo auditory training ) . For TEOAE testing , basic task participant similar TEOAE procedure use clinically evaluate hearing function objectively . Testing involve listen sound presented earphone seat comfortably sound-treated booth , remain alert quiet order successfully measure responses cochlea brainstem . All stimulus present moderate volume well sound level consider hazardous OSHA NIOSH standard . TEOAE measurement consist waveform , change sound amplitude across time . Word/sentence test involves listen word sentence present earphone seat sound-treated booth . Speech stimulus present presence background noise . Participants make response word ( ) heard . Sounds present safe comfortable level . For auditory training program , listener seat comfortably sound booth workstation computer screen , keyboard , mouse . Sounds present participant insert earphone . Participants make response concern heard mouse click keyboard entry . The auditory training program consist curriculum word sentence presentation various noise level , performance repeat measurement track throughout subject 's participation program . This minimal risk study . The participant healthy adult ( mild hearing loss participant ) . There foreseeable risk involve study beyond associate routine audiological practice , boredom fatigue test . All sound level use study fall Damage Risk Criteria establish OSHA intensity-duration interaction . Participants provide many break test experimenter feel helpful minimize mental fatigue boredom . Loudness level stimuli carefully control , frequent calibration monitor laboratory equipment . Participant confidentially protect use participant code ( three number ) label data collection sheet computer data file . All data record store password-protected computer hard copy lock office laboratory . Participant safety comfort data collection constantly monitor participant research team member collect data participant . Overall data collection monitor Principal Investigator . Following completion study , data maintain accordance Veterans Health Administration guideline . Regarding potential benefit participate , participant receive up-to-date hearing screen understanding hearing . Participants Experimental group may may notice improved ability hear sound background noise undergoing auditory training . The knowledge gain study may also benefit individual hearing-in-noise problem contribute improved diagnosis treatment hearing-in-noise problem Veterans civilian population .</detailed_description>
