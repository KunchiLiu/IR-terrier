	<detailed_description>Methylnaltrexone quaternary derivative pure opioid antagonists naltrexone . It fairly lipid soluble readily cross blood-brain barrier . This property provide methylnaltrexone potential block undesired side-effects opioid pain medication predominantly mediate receptor locate peripherally spar opioid effect mediate receptor central nervous system , importantly analgesia . This multicenter , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled trail investigate safety efficacy subcutaneous methylnaltrexone treat opioid-induced constipation patient advance illness . The randomization schedule use assign patient 2:1 ratio multicenter equal volume placebo administer subcutaneously alternate day 2 week . The clinical trail estimate enroll 180 patient totally .</detailed_description>
