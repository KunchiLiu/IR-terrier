	<detailed_description>Rationale : In dermatology , many minor surgical laser procedure carry local anesthesia skin . Anesthesia use topical formulation time consuming , anesthetic apply least one hour treatment , often partially effective . On hand infiltration anesthesia often associate discomfort tolerate patient example needle phobic . In past year , Haedersdal colleague show penetration various topically applied substance , include photosensitizers , skin enhance accelerated pretreatment skin fractional laser , create pattern microscopic ablation craters.1 This improvement drug penetration regardless ablation crater depth.2 There limited evidence transepidermal lidocaine absorption increase fractional laser pretreatment.3 , 4 These finding might suggest local anesthesia skin may achieve apply anesthetic topically skin surface pretreated fractional laser . The investigator present study hypothesize fractional laser assist delivery topical anesthetic might give faster well anesthetic effect , treatment standard treatment topical anesthesia . Objective : The objective study assess efficacy skin anesthesia use fractional laser assist delivery articaine hydrochloride 40 mg/ml epinephrine 10 µg/ml solution ( AHES ) compare standard anesthesia topical eutectic mixture lidocaine 25 mg/g prilocaine 25 mg/g cream ( EMLA cream ) . Study design : Prospective , open label , randomize control , within subject , study . Study population : patient &gt; 18 year , give write informed consent , visit institute fractional carbon dioxide laser treatment acne scar traumatic scar . Intervention ( applicable ) : In patient , lesional area divide two comparable region visit prior ( next ) fractional laser treatment . These region randomly allocate either standard anesthesia EMLA cream ( control region ; region I ) ablative fractional laser ( AFXL ) assist delivery AHES ( intervention region ; region II ) . Patients ask apply EMLA cream region I occlusion two hour prior laser treatment . Fifteen minute therapeutic laser treatment scar , skin region II pretreated fractional carbon dioxide laser ( 15 % density , 2.5 mJ/microbeam ) . Directly follow fractional laser pretreatment , AHES topically apply occlusion region II 15 minute . Subsequently treatment region perform fractional carbon dioxide laser setting use routine clinical practice . Directly therapeutic laser treatment , patient ask indicate pain per test region visual analogue scale ( VAS ) 0-10 ( 0 : pain ; 10 : worst imaginable pain ) .</detailed_description>
