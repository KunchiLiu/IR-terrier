	<detailed_description>The purpose study identify metabolite signature blood plasma and/or urine use panel biomarker metabolites differentiate child autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) child delay development ( DD ) and/or typical development ( TD ) , develop algorithm maximizes sensitivity specificity biomarker profile , evaluate algorithm diagnostic tool . A secondary objective define metabolite capable classify subtypes ASD may increase understand metabolic basis condition , well inform personalized therapy . The population target study include child age 18 month 48 month , diagnose ASD DD use behavioral criterion , TD child , identify indication ASD DD use behavioral criterion . The target size three group 500 child , total 1500 subject . The targeted male : female ratio 4:1 three group . If diagnostic biomarkers identify study perform well females biomarker discovery phase , study may expand recruit female examine possibility female-specific diagnostic test . Subjects qualify entry study invite participate . On first study day , subject ' parent sign inform consent form ask question mother 's pregnancy parent ' medical history . A complete medical history , physical examination , information need obtain diagnosis ASD , DD , TD obtain study subject . If possible , urine sample collect visit . Up four tube blood ( &lt; 25 mLs total ) drawn clinic visit within 14 day follow initial visit . An overnight fast require prior visit blood take subject . A subset subject ask return clinic 30-60 day later obtain replicate metabolic profile . The study divide biomarker discovery/method development phase follow validation phase analytical method algorithm use clinical test . The first 375 subject enrol group ( ASD , DD , TD ) use discovery/training set remain 125 subject hold aside use validation set . The training set use discovery biomarkers development analytical method intend diagnostic test . The validation sample set use evaluate performance final clinical method algorithms . Consent also seek subject follow-up contact 2 year follow enrollment determine accuracy original behavioral diagnosis . Subjects chosen follow-up identify base strength diagnosis behavioral score physician assessment well biomarker profile observe individual .</detailed_description>
