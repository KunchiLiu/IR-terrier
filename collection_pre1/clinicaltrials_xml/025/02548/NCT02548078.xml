	<brief_summary>The purpose study assess safety reactogenicity single IM dose ChAd3 EBO-Z vaccine , overall child age 1 5 , 6 12 , 13 17 year , separately Considering risk exposure Ebola potential ( base animal data ) investigational ChAd3-EBO-Z vaccine afford least partial protection , child study receive investigational ChAd3 EBO-Z vaccine . The child Group EBO-Z/ MENACWY-TT receive investigational ChAd3-EBO-Z vaccine Day 0 study , whereas child Group MENACWY-TT/ EBO-Z receive Nimenrix Day 0 ( control ) . At Month 6 , child Group MENACWY-TT/ EBO-Z receive investigational ChAd3-EBO-Z vaccine ( provided safety concern raise ) , whereas child Group EBO-Z/ MENACWY-TT receive Nimenrix..</brief_summary>
