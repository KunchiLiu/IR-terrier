	<brief_title>Estimation Biomechanical Aortic Wall Properties Healthy Aneurysmal Aortas Using Novel Imaging Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm , ( AAA ) , identify within vascular surgery practice . Those patient meet standard indication surgery include symptomatic AAA , size &gt; 5.0-5.5 cm , rapidly enlarge &gt; 0.5 cm per 6 month standard pre-operative work-up include magnetic resonance angiogram ( MRA ) Echocardiogram ( ECHO ) . These pre-operative study modify study patient include electrocardiogram ( ECG ) -gating ( couple MR angiogram ) 2-Dimensional speckle-tracking ultrasound abdominal aorta . Patients study follow 1 year . Measurements analyze relationship aortic wall property clinical outcome aneurysm growth , rupture risk aortic dissection . This study compare 3 group patient : surgery ( surveillance ) , open surgery , endovascular aneurysm repair ( EVAR ) .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients &gt; 18 year age ability provide inform consent . Patients either symptomatic asymptomatic AAA define aortic diameter ≥ 1.5x normal diameter . Patients nonaneurysmal aorta require aortic contrast image echocardiography preoperative planning reason . Patients contraindication IV contrast allergy severe kidney dysfunction . Patients require contrast imaging echocardiogram part care plan . Terminally ill patient , patient estimate life expectancy ≤ 6 month . Patients unable tolerate magnetic resonance imaging .</criteria>
