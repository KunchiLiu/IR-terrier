	<brief_title>A Study Safety Efficacy Coagulation Factor VIIa ( Recombinant ) LR769 Prevention Excessive Bleeding Congenital Hemophilia A B Patients With Inhibitors Factor VIII IX Undergoing Elective Surgery Other Invasive Procedure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study international , multicenter , single-arm , Phase 3 study . Patients age 6 month 75 year , inclusive , congenital hemophilia A B inhibitor Factor VIII Factor IX schedule elective surgical invasive procedure enrol . Both major minor surgical invasive procedure allow study . Initial Treatment : Regardless procedure , patient meet eligibility criterion receive initial intravenous ( IV ) bolus dose 75 - 200 µg/kg LR769 administer within ≤2 minute surgical incision start invasive procedure . The initial dose select investigator conjunction surgeon/practitioner base complexity procedure , number tissue plane traverse , patient 's previous response bypass agent , factor deem relevant investigator . Administration repeat frequently every 2 hour ( ±5 minute ) surgery invasive procedure . Treatment Major Surgical Procedures : The initial dose LR769 follow repeat administration 75 µg/kg LR769 every 2 hour ( ±5 minute ) first 48 hour completion procedure . The minimum duration LR769 treatment major procedure 5 day dose frequency follow accord guideline specify protocol . Treatment Minor Surgical Other Invasive Procedures : The initial dose LR769 follow repeat administration 75 µg/kg LR769 every 2 hour ( ±5 minute ) first 48 hour . The minimum duration LR769 infusion minor procedures 2 day , except certain procedure may require duration treatment achieve hemostasis note .</detailed_description>
