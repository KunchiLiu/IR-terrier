	<detailed_description>Title : Corneal change diabetic phacoemulsification Introduction : Cataract one common cause reversible blindness . In diabetic , Age-related cataract occur early nuclear cataract common tend progress rapidly . True diabetic cataract rare condition usually occur young adult due osmotic over-hydration lens . Initially large number fluid vacuole appear underneath anterior posterior capsule , soon follow appearance bilateral snowflake-like white opacity cortex . Diabetic hyperglycemia also inhibit function Na+ k+ ATPase activity thereby cause dysfunction corneal endothelial cell layer . The endothelial cell morphology also abnormal diabetic . Polymegathism Pleomorphism note . The cornea also find thicker diabetic owe slow recovery corneal edema . Phacoemulsification intraocular lens implantation one common surgical procedure perform cataract surgery small incision , decrease tissue injury , reduce post-operative pain inflammation , provide rapid refractive stabilization . Surgeries do cataract result decrease endothelial count phacoemulsification less degree endothelial damage compare surgery . Parameters like nucleus density ( 1 ) , axial length ( 2 ) ultrasound power ( 3 ) also influence endothelial cell count phacoemulsification . Aims objectives : 1 . To assess central corneal thickness endothelium phacoemulsification diabetic comparison non-diabetics . 2 . To assess factor associate Corneal endothelial cell damage phacoemulsification diabetic comparison non-diabetics . Review literature : Shultz et al ( 4 ) study morphologic change corneal endothelial cell diabetic duration 21 year , find diabetic corneal endothelial cell change cause continuously even ocular operation , diabetic cornea unstable vulnerable . They find annual rate reduction corneal endothelial cell 2.5 % per year operate eye extracapsular cataract extraction 0.3 % 0.5 % normal individual , thus show high reduction rate surgically treat eye 10 year analysis . Furuse coauthor ( 5 ) compare morphologic change corneal endothelial cell perform plan Extra capsular cataract extraction 96 normal age cataract patient diabetic patient . They observe significant difference 2 group term density corneal endothelial cell , co-efficient variation cell size , cell hexagonality 12 month postoperatively . Goebbels spitznas ( 6 ) perform flurophotometry corneal endothelium 4 day , 3 week 6 week phacoemulsification intraocular lens implantation endothelial permeability evaluate presence absence diabetes mellitus . Endothelial permeability differ diabetic non diabetic group operation , markedly increase group 4 day operation recover 3 week operation non diabetic group 6 week operation diabetic group . This result consistent delay recovery endothelial function cornea diabetic patient cataract surgery . Lee et al ( 7 ) study effect severity retinopathy endothelial loss post phacoemulsification find increased loss endothelial cell increase coefficient variation patient high risk proliferative diabetic retinopathy compare patient non proliferative diabetic retinopathy patient without diabetes . Su et al ( 8 ) design population base cross sectional study include 3239 eye examine relationship diabetic CCT . They find diabetes associate great CCT , independent age , sex IOP level . Inoue et al ( 9 ) investigate corneal endothelial structure corneal thickness 99 eye type 2 diabetes 97 control eye without diabetes . They find decrease cell density increase coefficient variation conclude corneal endothelial cell structure damage . Materials method : Whether study involve human : Humans animal Type study : Case control study Number group : 2 group . Group 1 - phacoemulsification diabetic Group 2 - phacoemulsification non-diabetics . Sample size : 80 patient group . The sample size estimate expect difference 19 corneal thickness 5 % level significance 80 % power . The minimum sample size estimate 70 group . The sample size modify expect drop 10 % . The protocol approve Institute Ethical Committee . The study do patient attend ophthalmology outpatient service visual ailments.Essential data name , age , sex hospital number patient enrol note . The purpose detail study explain subject obtain informed consent , patient recruit study . Preoperatively , detail ocular examination include visual acuity ( use Snellen 's chart equivalent E optotypes ) , refraction , slit lamp examination , corneal endothelial count morphology assessment ( ECD , CV , hexagonality ) use Konan noncon robo specular microscope ( Model - NSP 9900 ) corneal thickness use ultrasonic pachymeter do patient plan phacoemulsification surgery . Specular microscopy pachymetry measure observer subject . CCT measure topical anesthesia use one drop proparacaine eye drop ( 0.5 % w/v ) average three reading note . Intraoperative mydriasis , phacoemulsification time power note . Postoperatively , visual acuity , ocular inflammation score , corneal thickness , CD , CV hexagonality measure first week , six week three month . Ocular inflammation score calculate base SUN ( Standardization uveitis nomenclature ) work group grade scheme anterior chamber cell . Method analysis : Test difference group term demographic clinical characteristic do use Chi-Square test categorical variable . Independent student 's test Mann Whitney 's U test use compare continuous variable . To identify independent factor associate outcome , multiple logistic regression analysis use . Preoperative versus postoperative modification within group verify use two-way repeat measure ANOVA . All statistical test carry 5 % level significance p value &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Data analysis perform use SPSS ( version 20.0 , SPSS Inc. ) . Hypothesis : There Increase central corneal thickness decrease corneal endothelial count phacoemulsification surgery diabetic comparison non-diabetics .</detailed_description>
