	<brief_summary>It know whether consumption excessive amount sugar increase risk factor cardiovascular disease diabetes absence increase food ( caloric ) intake weight gain , whether negative effect sugar consumption make bad accompanied weight gain . This study investigate effect excess sugar consume energy-balanced diet prevents weight gain , effect excess sugar consume diet cause weight gain . The result determine whether excess sugar consumption excess caloric intake lead weight gain independent additive effect risk factor cardiovascular disease diabetes , potential influence dietary guideline public health policy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Adverse Metabolic Effects Dietary Sugar</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recent study demonstrate consume high fructose corn syrup ( HFCS ) - sucrose-sweetened beverage increase lipid/lipoprotein risk factor cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) healthy adult compare iso-caloric amount glucose low-fat milk . The long study , utilized 6-month intervention , also show increase liver muscle TG increase visceral adipose deposition . Neither study find difference weight gain subject consume HFCS/sucrose beverage compare control beverage . These result suggest excess calorie weight gain mediate effect dietary sugar/fructose development metabolic disease ; rather , dietary sugar per se also contributor . However , know whether consumption excessive amount sugar increase risk factor metabolic disease absence positive energy balance weight gain , whether adverse effect sugar consumption exacerbate weight gain . This study compare contribution sugar contribution energy level increase risk factor metabolic disease induced consumption HFCS-sweetened beverage energy-balanced ad libitum condition . The investigator measure risk factor process associate metabolic disease 4 group young , healthy adult consume 1 ) 0 % , 2 ) 25 % energy requirement HFCS-sweetened beverage energy-balanced diet ; 3 ) 0 % , 4 ) 25 % energy requirement HFCS-sweetened beverage ad libitum diet 8 week . All diet , formulate achieve comparable macronutrient intake ( 55 % energy carbohydrate , 35 % fat , 15 % protein ) among 4 experimental group , provide subject throughout entire study . The investigator hypothesize energy balance ( EB ) condition prevent body weight gain , consumption HFCS-sweetened beverage result adverse metabolic effect compare aspartame-sweetened beverage . Consumption HFCS-sweetened beverage ad libitum ( AL ) diet result increase energy intake body weight gain compare aspartame-sweetened beverage , also result adverse metabolic effect mark consumption HFCS-sweetened beverage energy-balanced diet . These result demonstrate consumption HFCS-sweetened beverage increase risk metabolic disease directly , via adverse effect fructose lipid carbohydrate metabolism , indirectly , via effect HFCS-sweetened beverage promote excess energy intake body weight gain . These finding potential influence dietary guideline public health policy .</detailed_description>
