	<brief_summary>Hypogonadism ( low testosterone ) become increasingly recognize problem affect numerous men United States . Symptoms may always feel tired , low sex drive , loss muscle mass . Treatment typically involve testosterone either injection topical gel form . However , administration testosterone without side effect . Testosterone supplementation therapy know cause variety side effect include high blood pressure high lipid ( fat ) increase proportion red blood cell . Side effect increase red blood cell include increase risk develop blood clot . The increase red blood cell related dihydrotestosterone ( DHT - male sex hormone ) activity . It normal testosterone become DHT . DHT various effect body include growth prostate gland , baldness , others DHT level link elevate red blood cell count men testosterone . Finasteride FDA approve medication use treatment benign prostatic hypertrophy ( BPH ) men enlarge prostate improve symptom reduce risk need surgery . Finasteride may prevent elevation reduce elevate red blood cell level men testosterone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypogonadism become increasingly recognize clinical syndrome affect million men United States globally , characterize symptom include chronic fatigue , decrease libido muscle mass , low serum testosterone level . Treatment hypogonadism men typically involve treatment exogenous testosterone . However , exogenous testosterone therapy without risk , cause numerous side effect include high blood pressure , hyperlipidemia , erythrocytosis , elevate hematocrit . Adverse effect erythrocytosis include increase risk develop thromboembolism , treatment erythrocytosis involve therapeutic phlebotomy testosterone dose adjustment , decrease symptomatic benefit testosterone therapy . Aghazadeh et al.found erythrocytosis occur testosterone therapy may relate dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) level . As part normal physiology , testosterone convert DHT via 5-alpha reductase ( 5AR ) . DHT associate various effect body , include stimulation prostate growth , male pattern baldness , others . Currently , finasteride , 5-alpha reductase inhibitor ( 5ARI ) , available FDA-approved drug use treat DHT-related prostate growth prevent DHT-related baldness . Given positive association DHT increase hematocrit see men treat hypogonadism exogenous testosterone , finasteride 's effect prevent synthesis DHT may improve even prevent erythrocytosis men testosterone . The study prospective randomize controlled trial patient injectable testosterone therapy . Subjects evenly distribute control treatment group . The treatment group receive finasteride control group . All subject follow blood test determine change hematocrit , testosterone , DHT , blood test value . An interim data analysis perform approximately 150 men ( 75 treatment 75 control ) accrue study follow least 1 year . Rates hematocrit elevation erythrocytosis evaluate finasteride treat untreated men determine whether finasteride impact erythrocytosis rate whether unanticipated adverse effect occur . Secondary outcome , include effect erythropoietin hepcidin level , also evaluate . Study accrual continue evidence finasteride may decrease incidence erythrocytosis . The study stop unacceptable adverse event identify evidence suggest finasteride mitigates risk erythrocytosis .</detailed_description>
