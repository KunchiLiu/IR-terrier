	<brief_summary>The primary objective confirm clinical safety feasibility combine antigen-loaded Dendritic Cell ( DC ) vaccine chemotherapy include folinic acid , oxaliplatin , irinotecan 5-Fluorouracil ( 5FU ) ( FOLFIRINOX ) nab-paclitaxel/gemcitabine patient pancreatic cancer . The secondary objective trial determine preliminary clinical efficacy base response rate , overall survival progression free survival compare historic control , surgical conversion rate define percent locally advance ( unresectable ) patient achieve resectability within 6 month treatment initiation . Also , identify vaccine immunogenicity measuring acquire , T cell-mediated immune activate event post-vaccination correlate clinical response acquire immune response .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dendritic Cell Vaccine Chemotherapy Patients With Pancreatic Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single center , exploratory pilot safety , open label , phase I trial evaluate combination DC vaccination 2 group patient combined chemotherapy include FOLFIRINOX gemcitabine+nab-paclitaxel patient pancreatic cancer . The investigation accrue 20 evaluable subject 20 month 10 patient group . Subjects assign group 1 group 2 accord subject 's disease stage . The protocol conduct two stage : The 1st 3 patient enrol either group receive DC vaccination combine standard chemotherapy . A safety analysis perform first 3 patient complete 6 vaccine . If vaccine dose-limiting toxicity occur 3 patient study proceed stage 2 . Stage 2 include enrollment remain 17 patient .</detailed_description>
