	<detailed_description>Freezing gait ( FoG ) devastate symptom Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) affect half patient population . Defined intermittent failure initiate maintain effective stepping , FoG common cause fall injury PD . There unmet press need develop novel therapeutic strategy treat disable drug- deep brain stimulation ( DBS ) -resistant FoG PD . The objective research study uncover electrical biomarker FoG human electroencephalography ( EEG ) good understand neurophysiological underpinnings symptom inform development clinical intervention FoG . The central hypothesis EEG activity motor cortex exhibit significant change lead FoG episode . This biomarker facilitate detection FoG event directly scalp recording . The rationale propose research non-invasive detection FoG episode use guide responsive DBS strategy resolve episode prevent potential injury . Furthermore , hypothesize biomarker modulate therapeutic DBS setting FoG turn . Given vast number DBS parameter combination need test chronically verify , biomarker significantly shorten clinical programming prevent side effect non-optimal stimulation setting . This study review change scalp record EEG gait parameter natural FoG episodes participant ambulatory advance gait laboratory set use wireless EEG amplifier active electrode . The modulation uncover biomarker clinical programming DBS settings participant bilateral DBS implant globus pallidus internus ( GPi ) pedunculopontine nucleus ( PPN ) . This project innovative dataset acquire first kind PD patient FoG , open new direction multidisciplinary investigation potentially uncover cortical mechanism FoG human turn could lead novel effective therapy suffer PD . This contribution significant provide critical unmet therapeutic option FoG decrease morbidity mortality associate FoG related fall . In summary , follow goal accomplish : - Recruit subject undergone DBS implantation treatment PD clinically verify FoG . - Collect EEG data ambulatory task often induce FoG episode uncover biomarkers FoG . - Develop closed-loop paradigm acute test FoG event detect EEG data . - Use EEG biomarkers guide DBS parameter selection treatment FoG .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A clinical diagnosis idiopathic PD , without previous DBS operation must deem appropriate DBS operation interdisciplinary screening team ( must meet UK Brain Bank criterion diagnosis idiopathic Parkinson 's disease ) . Experiencing significant gait postural instability despite optimal pharmacologic management ( Hoehn Yahr Stage II great state ) . Best medication `` '' reveal meaningful improvement posture score ( Pull Test ) . Patients must challenge person suprathreshold dose levodopa ( 1.5 time optimized regular dose levodopa ) must poor improvement postural stability . Patients must possess clinical history gait freeze &gt; 2 episode per month , include , participant must also score &gt; 1 item # 3 Freezing Gait ( FOG ) Questionnaire exhibit five FoG episode provocation protocol state . Ldopa responsive clearly define `` '' period . Willingness ability cooperate conscious operative procedure , well postsurgical evaluation , adjustment medication stimulator setting . Clinically significant medical disease would increase risk develop pre postoperative complication . Clinically significant medical disease include uncontrolled systemic hypertension value 170/100mmHg ; cardiac pulmonary disease ; uncorrected coagulation abnormality need therapeutic anticoagulation interrupt ; condition would render patient unable safely cooperate study test judge screen physician . Evidence secondary atypical parkinsonism . Other neurological musculoskeletal impairment would negatively influence postural stability Past MRI scan significant evidence brain atrophy abnormality .
