	<brief_summary>The purpose study match genetic component clinical attribute anovulatory patient response clomiphene treatment . By improve understanding patient-specific clomiphene response allow optimization treatment , reduction side-effects shorten time-to-pregnancy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>To Study The Influence Of Genomic Factors On Metabolism And Effects Of Clomiphene In Asian Normogonadotrophic Anovulatory Patients .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Anovulation common cause infertility , clomiphene standard treatment . Pharmacogenetic cause variability pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics clomiphene well characterize anovulatory Asian woman . Although recent finding suggest pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics clomiphene may influence several polygenic pathway involve gene regulate metabolism ( CYP3A4 , CYP3A5 , CYP2B6 , CYP2C8 , CYP2C19 , CYP2D6 ) , thus contribute significantly wide variability dose-response relationship observe clinical practice . There objective evidence thus far unbiased genome-wide perspective . It likely polymorphisms CYP cluster gene encode respective cytochrome protein may explain variability regard clomiphene 's dose-response relationship . The investigator hypothesize pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics clomiphene strong control genetic locus genetic variant could also strongly determine therapeutic outcome Asian normogonadotrophic anovulatory patient . The contribution candidate gene mention also clarify definitive manner study .</detailed_description>
