	<detailed_description>Observational study demonstrate inverse relationship eat frequency ( EF ) , obesity , marker disease risk . It suggest consumption several small , frequent meal may influence physiological mechanism , reduce risk disease lower appetite . Participants randomize crossover study complete two intervention phase last three week : one low eat frequency ( `` low-EF '' ; 3 eat occasions/day ) one high eating frequency ( `` high-EF '' ; 8 eat occasions/day ) . Fasting C-reactive protein , insulin-like growth factor , leptin measure baseline endpoint phase optional subjective appetite test session last four hour offer endpoint phase . During appetite testing session , participant consume amount food equal total energy macronutrient content either one occasion 8:00 ( `` low-EF '' condition ) spread evenly two small eating occasion 8:00 10:30 ( `` high-EF '' condition ) . Ratings hunger , desire eat , fullness , thirst , nausea make every 30 minute use paper-and-pencil semi-anchored 100-mm Visual Analog Scales . A composite appetite score calculate mean hunger , desire eat , 100-fullness . The generalized estimating equation modification linear regression use compare fast plasma biomarkers mean rating subjective appetite .</detailed_description>
