	<detailed_description>Overview The evaluation also assess effect community-based sport intervention ( 1 x 30 min session per week ) physical activity level cognitive function type 2 diabetes patient . Physical activity know assist management type 2 diabetes , thus effect intervention physical activity level interest . In addition , type 2 diabetes show detrimentally affect cognitive function . Therefore , evaluation also assess effect community-based sport intervention cognitive function type 2 diabetes patient . This project engage inactive patient diagnose type 2 Diabetes regular sport physical activity . The aim project use community base sport physical activity enhance health wellbeing facilitate effective management type 2 diabetes . Working Nottingham City 60 GP Practices Diabetes Specific Nurses , 3 south area CCGs 60 GP Practices , patient ' sport interest motivation identify matched appropriate , local , community-based sport exercise opportunity deliver specially trained instructor coach . The aim study ( total duration 3 year ) engage 4032 people 1 x 30 minute sport/exercise per week , 12 month . Primary research question ( ) /evaluation aim ( ) : Change baseline number participant report one session sport per week measure UK Single Item Questionnaire . Secondary research question ( ) /evaluation aim ( ) : Change baseline body mass ( kg ) ; Change baseline hip circumference ( cm ) Change baseline waist circumference ( cm ) Change baseline quality life measure Quality Life Survey ( QOLS ) ( sum 16 item , 7 point likert scale ) ; Change baseline control blood glucose concentration measure self-report survey ( subjective rating , 'better ' , 'the ' , 'worse ' ) ; Change baseline control blood glucose concentration measure HPA1c concentration ( mmol/mol ) Objectives To use community base sport physical activity engage 4032 inactive patient , diagnose type 2 diabetes , 1 x 30 minute sport / exercise per week , 3 year . In , enhance health wellbeing patient help facilitate effective management type 2 diabetes . Design A questionnaire distributed 4032 patient ( 3 year duration project ) baseline , 3 , 6 12 month . The questionnaire ask question sport participation , physical activity undertaken sedentary behaviour , allow examination whether Fit4life project increase quantity sport physical activity undertaken inactive patient , diagnose type 2 diabetes . The questionnaire also contain question investigate quality life patient , perception effort type quantity medication use patient involvement Fit4 life project ; allow examination whether Fit4life project enhance health wellbeing inactive patient , diagnose type 2 diabetes . In addition , per Sport England requirement , data collect : The number people engage project ( target outcome measure ) ; number inactive people engage project ; number inactive people move 1 x 30 minute sport ; number people still engage sport 3 , 6 12 month . In small sub-sample patient involve project ( n=50-100 ) direct assessment physical activity , health status physiological function make . These assessment may include measurement : physical activity via accelerometer / pedometer ; waist hip circumference ; fast blood glucose , HPA1c c-peptide concentration ; response treadmill walk . In order provide rich , explanatory data , provide information project process , project work receive , focus group / telephone interview conduct patient ( n=30-40 per year ) , practitioner key stakeholder . The survey include question : - The number people engage project - The number inactive people engage project - The number inactive people move 1 x 30 minute sport - The number people still engage sport 3 month - The number people still engage sport 6 month - The number people still engage sport 12 month - Socio-economic status via post code income - Demographic characteristic e.g . sex , ethnicity , religion disability - Perception effort via Borg scale - Quality life - Diabetes medication use - Diabetes symptom - Enjoyment sport session - Quality sporting session , leader , venue , intensity duration Measured directly participants project team : - Waist hip circumference - Height body mass Measured directly investigators sub-sample 50-100 : - physical activity via accelerometer / pedometer - waist hip circumference - height body mass - fast blood glucose - HPA1c c-peptide concentration - response treadmill walk Focus group telephone semi-structured interview sub-sample 40-50 participant ( accepted qualitative method ) - Process evaluation - Perceptions health fitness result project participation Approximately four thousand patient recruit project randomly allocate experimental group ( 9/10 patient recruited time point ) control group ( 1/10 patient recruited time point ) . The experimental group complete questionnaire 0 , 3 , 6 12 month involvement Fit4Life project . The control group complete questionnaire 0 3 month . Due need provide service participant solicit co-operation GPs involve project control participant join sport activity offer participant , take part evaluation . As control participant recruit throughout project , statistically data combine form roll control full period intervention analysis mixed longitudinal design undertaken consultant statistician ( Prof. Alan Nevill ) . Patients recruit approximately 240 GP practice Nottingham City South Nottinghamshire area . GPs provide patient project information ( include telephone email contact number ) patient contact project team . Patients also self-refer road show event ask obtain note GP express suitability take part project . A process evaluation ( project work staff patient ) undertake via focus group telephone interview describe earlier . Time-scale September/October 2015 : NHS Ethics approval gain October 2015 onwards : patient recruitment intervention control group on-going throughout study October 2015 : first patient recruit complete baseline questionnaire intervention group motivational interview October 2015 : intervention group start sport activity December 2015 : early recruit control intervention group patient complete 3 month survey ; first control join sport activity take part evaluation February 2016 : first focus group patient interview leader staff take place March 2016 : early recruit intervention group patient complete 6 month survey May 2016 : focus group interview take place June 2016 : early recruit intervention group patient complete 9 month survey September 2016 : early recruit intervention group patient complete 12 month survey September 2016 : end year one report submit Sport England October 2016 : dissemination early finding September 2017 : end year two report submit Sport England October 2017 : dissemination interim finding September 2018 : final report submit Sport England October 2018 : dissemination study finding Analysis result Survey data download SPSS ( Statistical package Social Sciences ) difference intervention control group ( account sex demographic characteristic ) examine use appropriate statistical method multi-level model mixed longitudinal design . Interview focus group data transcribe , cod analyse interview theme theme ( include unexpected outcome ) emerge data set . Laboratory data directly analyse use standard laboratory procedure determination oxygen uptake expire air sample determination blood glucose use automate PENTRA analyser purchase standard control . All patient recruit Fit4life programme initial assessment baseline questionnaire complete . This assessment take place GP clinic . Patients start study group 10 ease logistical problem follow-up measurement . Patients introduction study ( verbal write ) addition initial information receive telephone write format recruitment . Patients sign inform consent form complete baseline questionnaire ( opportunity ask question project staff ) . In addition intervention control group body mass , height , waist hip circumference measure private project staff . Control participant leave baseline questionnaire anthropometric measurement complete return 3 month complete another questionnaire join sport activity ( participant include intervention group evaluation ) . Patients also ask weigh home scale arrive . Project staff undertake motivational interview intervention group participant allocate sport activity . Thus participant recruit complete baseline survey . To enhance completion 3 month subsequent survey , administer sport venue possible ( facility available ) project staff patient get know . Where possible patient invite back original clinic project staff get know motivational interview . Surveys post emailed patient catch either method . A limitation participant weigh home , obtain validation measure scale via initial assessment meeting .</detailed_description>
