	<detailed_description>The purpose research study learn whether oxytocin treatment decrease use craving opioids ( narcotic ) people use opioids heavily long period unable stop . Oxytocin make naturally release part brain act like chemical signal one cell another . Oxytocin approve Food Drug Administration stimulate labor pregnant woman approve treatment opioid dependence . People use large amount opioids every day many day per week week month undergo chemical change brain . They continue use opioids frequently heavily , even though may know opioid use good health , unpleasant experience stop decrease amount use . Those experience include increased anxiety , difficulty sleeping , difficulty tolerate stress , crave use opioids , well physical symptom withdrawal feel sweaty chill , bone joint ache , muscle cramp , nausea , diarrhea . Studies show give oxytocin opioid-addicted animal diminish opioid use deny access opioids reduce symptom put opioid withdrawal . This randomized , double-blind , Placebo-controlled trial subject opioid dependence test efficacy intranasal Oxytocin ( OT ) treatment v . Placebo ( contain ingredient OT spray except OT ) : 1. reduce opioid withdrawal symptom 2. total amount standard , PRN medication require control withdrawal symptom medical opioid detoxification . Treatment assignment random within sex . Each treatment group compose 25 subject . Essentially , study involve add daily OT Placebo administration fix schedule onto standard symptom trigger treatment opioid withdrawal use non-opioid medication . Subjects recruit patient admitted Addictions Detoxification Unit ( ADU ) Wakebrook , local mental health center Wake County , NC medical detoxification opioids . There selection basis gender , ethnicity race . ADU professional staff educate inclusion exclusion criterion study . They describe study newly-admitted opioid-dependent patient appear meet criterion . If patient express interest participation , ADU staff either call Study Coordinator ( UNC Hospitals ) soon possible inform member research team visit ADU weekday morning . Also , research personnel contact ADU morning afternoon inquire newly admit patient . If Study Coordinator contact potential study candidate , Coordinator contact inform member research team visit ADU morning potential study participant . As soon possible potential subject admit ADU , research personnel obtain informed consent conduct initial brief assessment determine subject meet criterion inclusion study . The brief assessment include completion : 1. urine sample collection rapid drug screen confirm opioid use determine current substance use , woman , test pregnancy ; 2. review medical exclusion criterion ; 3. vital sign ( VS ) measurement ; 4. M.I.N.I . psychiatric interview screen question psychotic disorder , severe major depression , mania , suicidality ; 5. Time Line Follow Back interview quantify addictive substance consumption precede 3 month ; 6. SCID Substance Use Disorders Module determine prospective subject meet DSM-IV-R criterion opioid dependence , currently meet criterion opioid withdrawal , currently past 3 month meet criterion dependence substance exclusionary study ; 7. draw 5-ml blood sample serum sodium concentration assay . Physical examination complete Wakebrook physician within 24 hour patient admit . Findings physical examination available later day admission follow day , initiation intranasal dose . If significant physical exam abnormality identify , treatment subject participation study stop immediately . Vital sign measure regular interval patient . We draw blood assay serum sodium concentration safety measure study . If need , prospective subject receive PRN medication withdrawal symptom recruitment procedure initiate intranasal test treatment begin . Treatment Protocol Measures : If subject qualify inclusion study , withdrawal symptom immediately measure use well-validated Clinical Opiate Withdrawal Scale ( COWS ) complete self-rating opioid crave use 100-mm visual analog scale ( VAS ) , Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale ( SOWS ) baseline Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory ( SSTAI ) . This follow self-administration first intranasal dose substance randomize supervision research personnel ADU professional staff . The second dose first day admission give 2 hour first . A third dose give later first day admission ( least 4 hour second dose ) . On subsequent day admission , dose take twice daily ( shortly breakfast lunch dinner ) . All inpatient self-administration intranasal test dos monitor ADU research staff . Each dose consist 10 insufflation Syntocinon Spray placebo ( contain ingredient Syntocinon Spray except Oxytocin ) . Each insufflation give 30 sec apart alternate nostril . Oxytocin Placebo dose administered identical blind-labeled 60-ml spray bottle deliver 0.1 ml aerosolize solution/spray per insufflation . Intranasal test treatment administer 5 day . After first intranasal test dose , research personnel complete rest M.I.N.I . psychiatric interview . During first 2 inpatient day vital sign , objective COWS subjective SOWS subject self-rating opioid craving obtain every 4 hour whenever subject report nurse observe onset withdrawal symptom . Subsequently , COWS SOWS measure obtain twice daily whenever withdrawal symptom increase least 2 additional day longer subject continue exhibit significant symptom . Subjects complete VAS subjective rating opioid crave State portion SSTAI inpatient day start admission day 2 approximately 1 hour second intranasal test dose . In subject , per protocol , multiple as-needed non-opioid medication available symptom opioid withdrawal .</detailed_description>
