	<brief_summary>Use high loading dos clopidogrel ( antiplatelet drug ) coronary intervention associate improved outcome coronary stenting . However onset platelet inhibition clopidogrel load take 2 4 hour action variable . A way overcome limitation load potent antiplatelet drug prasugrel . Therefore current study investigator want compare load 60 mg prasugrel ( potent antiplatelet drug ) load clopidogrel ( standard drug ) patient undergo elective coronary intervention .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Loading Strategies With Antiplatelet Drugs Patients Undergoing Elective Coronary Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients stable clinically unstable ( biomarker-negative ) angina pectoris need coronary intervention randomly assign one treatment strategies - 60 mg prasugrel 600 mg clopidogrel prior percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) . After PCI patient receive clopidogrel 75 mg/d per standard . The patient monitor throughout 30-day time frame ischemic bleeding event record . The study power show superiority single-dose 60 mg prasugrel single-dose 600 mg clopidogrel regard ischemic complication 30-day follow-up .</detailed_description>
