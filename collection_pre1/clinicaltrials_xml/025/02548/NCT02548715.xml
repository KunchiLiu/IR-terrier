	<detailed_description>Background Scope : Hypothyroidism one common complication follow multimodality treatment head neck cancer , incidence 7-58 % depend subsite . The cause high rate hypothyroidism follow treatment head neck cancer multifactorial . Patients treated head neck cancer often require radiation therapy ( RT ) . The negative effect RT thyroid well publish , resultant hypothyroidism widespread implication patient 's physical mental health . Head neck surgery also hypothesize devascularize disturb overall anatomical structure thyroid , thus contribute high incidence hypothyroidism surgery . Despite literature demonstrate connection head neck cancer treatment hypothyroidism , complication illness major head neck surgery remain common . Decreased survival well increase rate fistulas , infection , wind breakdown physical consequence . Other possible issue include decreased functional outcome increase mental illness , know consequence untreated hypothyroidism . While several study examine rate time hypothyroidism radiation head neck , paucity literature effect surgery thyroid function . Specifically , patient treat single modality surgery , patient treat primary surgery start RT , risk wound complication high . Synthroid synthetic thyroid hormone , mainstay treatment patient proven hypothyroidism surgical thyroid removal . Its use effect study fifty year . Side effect drug commonly occur overdose mimic hyperthyroidism , may include : heart palpitation , abdominal pain , nausea , anxiety , confusion , agitation , insomnia , weight loss , increase appetite . There low chance ( &lt; 1 % ) allergic reaction drug , may include shortness breath , swell face tongue . Whereas treatment algorithms clinical hypothyroidism well establish , treatment subclinical hypothyroidism remain controversial . Subclinical hypothyroidism refers state elevate thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) , normal near-normal thyroid hormone level ( T3 T4 ) , lack symptom hypothyroidism . Endocrinologists disagree whether disease treat , since almost always asymptomatic , treatment mainly relief symptom . Head neck cancer patient , however , represent special population , effect subclinical hypothyroidism result consequence besides symptom , wound heal issue fistula development describe . Studies show rate subclinical hypothyroidism head neck cancer treatment high . Therefore investigator propose single blind randomize control trial compare outcome patient subclinical hypothyroidism , give standardize dose synthroid treatment head neck surgery versus treat conventional therapy . A secondary goal study determine rate clinical subclinical hypothyroidism surgical treatment head neck cancer , without RT start RT . Objectives : Primary Objectives : - To assess effect synthroid treatment patient subclinical hypothyroidism follow head neck surgery 's effect survival , gastrostomy tube ( G-tube ) rate , fistula formation , wound breakdown , infection . Secondary Objectives - To determine rate clinical subclinical hypothyroidism surgery head neck cancer - To determine factor predictive development clinical subclinical hypothyroidism surgery head neck cancer Methods : This single-center double blind randomize placebo-controlled trial effect synthroid treatment immediately surgery head neck cancer . Patient meeting eligibility criterion identify time book surgery approach member research team . Data collect medical record variable study study-specific data sheet . Data sheet de-identified input secure database password protect hard drive room lock . Data export statistical analysis collection complete . The population comprise patient underwent surgery without combination RT and/or chemotherapy treatment non-thyroid head neck cancer . Surgery define surgical resection primary closure reconstruction loco-regional flap autogenous free tissue transfer . RT define curative dose therapy . Chemotherapy define single agent therapy combination cisplatin carboplatin . Patients prospectively enrol start March 1 , 2015 March 1 , 2016 . The expected accrual patient group 200 patient . The demographic head neck mucosal cancer indicate male : female ratio 3 : 1 mean age approximately 60 year range 18 - 85 year . In order assess pre- post-operative thyroid function , patient undergo blood test include TSH , free T3 , free T4 level one week prior surgery , weekly follow surgery , 8 week post-operatively ( receive radiation ) , 8 week start radiation ( receive radiation therapy ) . Patients classify `` normal '' ( normal TSH normal free T3 free T4 level ) , `` hypothyroid '' ( elevate TSH , decrease free T3 free T4 ) , `` subclinical hypothyroid '' ( elevate TSH ( 4-10mIU/L ) , normal free T3 free T4 ) . Patients `` normal '' thyroid function randomize treatment arm , post-operative outcome record , accord section 8.0 . Patients `` hypothyroid '' treat hypothyroidism accord standard care , keep American Thyroid Association ( ATA ) / American Association Clinical Endocrinologists ( AACE ) guideline . Patients `` subclinical hypothyroidism '' randomize either treatment arm placebo arm , time discovery subclinical hypothyroidism ( lab value abnormality note ) . Patients randomize treatment arm treat standard dose 1.6mcg/kg/day synthroid , target treatment normalized TSH ( 0.2-4.0mIU/L ) , measure 6 week treatment , accord ATA/AACE guideline .</detailed_description>
