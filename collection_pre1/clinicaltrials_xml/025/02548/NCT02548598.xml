	<detailed_description>This cross-sectional non-interventional study investigate mechanism disease patient asthma concomitant chronic sinusitis and/or nasal polyp ( upper airway disease ) . Approximately 160 participant enrol . Patients schedule undergo inpatient outpatient endoscopic sinus surgery University California San Francisco clinical management upper airway disease invite participate . Leftover tissue mucus surgery collect process research purpose . This study consist three study arm , ( 1 ) Full Characterization ( AIMS-Full ) , ( 2 ) Surgery ( AIMS-OR ) , ( 3 ) Mucus Collection ( AIMS-M ) . Participants recruit enrolled either AIMS-Full AIMS-OR ( base participant availability ) . Participants complete initial characterization study ( either AIMS-Full AIMS-OR ) , may also go participate AIMS-M arm , focus mainly sample collection . Participants choose participate either characterization arm able enroll directly AIMS-M sample collection . Suitable patient , undergo endoscopic sinus surgery , identify recruit study team . Patients first ask participate AIMS-Full characterization . If patient unable unwilling participate AIMS-Full , option take part AIMS-OR AIMS-M arm . AIMS-OR consist endoscopic sinus surgery optional pre-procedure visit consent blood specimen obtain questionnaire administer . If optional pre-procedure visit do , consent obtain surgery visit , blood collect . AIMS-M consist 5 visit . Patients see UCSF Sinus Center clinic may clearance sinus mucus part routine clinical care ; AIMS-M visit collect mucus sample would otherwise discard . Sinus mucus obtain clinic visit may use research purpose patient give consent participate AIMS-M arm study . Participants three study arm complete study-specific questionnaire asthma allergy history impairment provide sample nasal secretion collect part routine clinical care would otherwise discard . Those participate either characterization arm ( AIMS-Full AIMS-OR ) also provide nasal tissue ( part routine surgical procedure ) ; airway epithelial brushing blood collection ( study purpose ) . Those participate AIMS-Full also participate follow study procedure : medical history physical exam ( include vital sign body anthropometrics ) , spirometry , methacholine challenge airway reversibility testing , exhale nitric oxide , questionnaire ( asthma , sinusitis , metabolic health ) , urine collection , sputum induction . A participant 's time commitment study vary depend arm participant enrol .</detailed_description>
