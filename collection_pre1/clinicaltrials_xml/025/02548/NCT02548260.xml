	<brief_summary>Proximal interphalangeal joint injury finger may treat various way treatment show superior . The investigator wish study effectiveness syndactyly versus digital splint compare joint mobility . The investigator also wish study effectiveness finger compression reduce edema therefore allow great arc motion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Proximal Interphalangeal Joint Injuries . Clinical Efficiency Syndactyly Treatment Digital Compression</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Proximal interphalangeal joint ( PIPJ ) injuries finger common occurrence . They may treat various way : strict immobilization finger splint one three week , syndactyly , immobilization . Immobilization often responsible joint stiffness whereas immediate mobilization might produce pain . Injuries joint hand produce edema responsible additional stiffness . Compressive garment may wear limit extent edema help resorption . Although PIPJ injury frequent , treatment benefit consensus . Most study retrospective aim pediatric population . The investigator wish evaluate outcome PIPJ injury different treatment : either strict immobilization rigid splint three week , relative immobilization syndactyly three weeks.The investigator also wish study effect finger compression edema resolution finger motion . Therefore four treatment group : syndactyly without compression , rigid splint without compression . The study conduct hand surgery unit university hospital prospective way . The assignment particular treatment group randomly perform . Patients follow 6 month .</detailed_description>
