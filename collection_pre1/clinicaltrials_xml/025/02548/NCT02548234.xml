	<brief_title>Effect Mirror Therapy Versus Bilateral Arm Training Rehabilitation After Chronic Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study background : Approximately 80 % stroke survivor upper and/or low limb impairment ( Barker 1997 ) , impairment arm explain 50 % variance functional limitation stroke . Brain image research use magnetoencephalography find mirror therapy combine bilateral arm training could potentially aid stroke rehabilitation normalize asymmetrical pattern movement-related beta desynchronization primary motor cortex . However , different neural mechanism may cause different effect motor control recovery two different approach , yet study . Study purpose：To compare efficacy mirror therapy bilateral arm training movement strategy affect upper extremity functional outcome chronic stroke patient . Study method : This single-blind , randomize , comparative efficacy research . Sixty participant chronic stroke recruit China medical university hospital randomly assign mirror therapy bilateral arm training group . The intervention consist 1.5 hrs/day , 5 days/wk 4 wks , include 3 day hospital-based therapy 5 day home treatment . Primary outcome muscular property ( muscle tone stiffness ) sensorimotor measurement . Secondary outcome include measure daily function acceleration gain insight movement capability . The validity reliability measurement propose . Finally , Chi-square test , Analysis variance Analysis covariance use compare significant difference mean value two approach . Partial η2 report also effect size dependent variable .</detailed_description>
