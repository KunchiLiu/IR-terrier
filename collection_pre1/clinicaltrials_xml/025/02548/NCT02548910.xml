	<brief_title>Phlebotomy Prevent Blood Loss Major Hepatic Resections</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Major liver resection associate significant intraoperative blood loss . Blood loss elective liver surgery key determinant perioperative morbidity mortality , well possibly long-term oncologic outcome . Whole blood phlebotomy simple intervention , whose aim decrease central venous pressure yield state relative hypovolemia thus lead decreased blood loss . Small study , mostly liver transplant literature , would suggest phlebotomy control hypovolemia result decrease blood loss blood transfusion . Since blood loss important issue liver surgery , benefit phlebotomy control hypovolemia unknown liver resection patient , rigorously conduct trial representative population patient undergo liver resection warrant , feasible . In proposal , hypothesize use phlebotomy control hypovolemia , possible decrease blood loss blood transfusion . To test hypothesis investigator plan randomly allocate participant phlebotomy plus standard care standard care . Participants patient undergo elective major liver resection Ottawa Hospital indication . The primary outcome intraoperative blood loss . Secondary outcome include transfusion requirement , perioperative morbidity mortality , safety , physiologic parameter , feasibility element . A total 62 patient randomize . The efficacy phlebotomy term blood loss prevention assess .</detailed_description>
