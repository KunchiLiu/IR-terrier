	<detailed_description>IMPACT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THE MELD SCORE TO PRIORITIZE THE WAITING LIST ON SURVIVAL , BLOOD LOSSES , AND TRANSFUSION REQUIREMENT FOR 700 CONSECUTIVE LIVER TRANSPLANTATIONS , OBSERVATIONAL STUDY INTRODUCTION Orthotopic liver transplantation ( OLT ) classically associate coagulation defect , blood loss , need massive blood product transfusion . Transfusion blood product may contribute morbidity mortality . Ironically , one third patient OLT acquire disease transfusion blood product . The Child-Turcotte score develop predict complication Porto-cave shunt surgery . This classification use prioritize patient wait OLT . This classification include 3 subjective variable ( nutrition , encephalopathy , ascites control ) improve replace nutrition international normalize ratio ( INR ) . The Model End-Stage Liver Disease ( MELD ) score initially create predict survival patient complication portal hypertension undergo elective placement transjugular intrahepatic porto-systemic shunt ( TIPS ) . The MELD score may improvement Child-Turcotte-Pugh score include 3 objective laboratory test result : bilirubin ( mg/dL ) , creatinine ( mg/dL ) , INR . More recently , MELD score validate retrospectively prospectively accurate predictor mortality patient chronic end-stage liver disease . After , MELD system adopt reduce ever-increasing mortality patient wait list OLT . The MELD score numerical scale , range 6 ( less ill ) 40 ( gravely ill ) . The MELD system constantly scrutinize revise . So 's difficult compare patient ' MELD different period . Some author try use MELD score predict blood product requirement survival OLT . Although MELD system reduces mortality patient wait list , prioritize sick patient raise number concern . One main concern MELD may worsen post-OLT outcome result futile transplantation . Many study suggest patient high MELD score bad post-OLT outcome patient low MELD score . The MELD system adopt province Quebec July 2009 . Before allocation system : first priority intubate patient intensive care unit . The second priority patient intensive care unit . The third priority hospitalize patient , final priority patient home . The goal observational study evaluate impact adoption MELD system prioritize patient wait list OLT survival 700 consecutive liver transplantation . Survival evaluate wait list , one month , one year transplantation . Another goal look blood loss transfusion requirement adoption MELD score . The hypothesis MELD system ameliorate survival rate wait , post-OLT worse . Blood loss transfusion could worse MELD system . METHODS After approval Ethic committee Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal ( CHUM ) ( 15.113 ) registration Clinical Trials.gov ( NCT… ) non-experimental comparative study conduct . 704 consecutive liver transplantation study October 26th , 2002 October 4th , 2014 . Prioritization first 402 OLTs Quebec 's allocation system time . The last 302 OLTs prioritize accord MELD system ( since July 9th , 2009 ) . Surgery Protocol Eight hepatobiliary surgeon perform OLTs , 25 anesthesiologist involve throughout study period . Monitoring standardized patient , anesthesia technique ( arterial canula , pulmonary artery catheter , sufentanil , propofol , rocuronium , desflurane ) . In absence uncontrollable bleed coagulation disorder correct time transplantation . No fresh frozen plasma ( FFP ) , platelets cryoprecipitate give `` wait-and-see '' approach rescue therapy use instead prophylactic preventive intervention . The trigger Hb level RBC transfusion set 60 70 g/L . An effort make start RBC transfusion blood loss control . In presence diffuse ooze ( clinical evidence coagulation ) plasma ( 10-15 ml/kg ) transfuse international normalized ratio ( INR ) value high 1.5 2.0 . Platelets also transfuse ( 5-10 unit ) platelet count low 30 X 109 pl/L , cryoprecipitate ( 5 unit ) fibrinogen low 1.3-2.0 g/L . Aprotinin administer every case first 302 OLTs accord Hammersmith protocol ( 37 ) . The last 402 OLTs receive tranexamic acid antifibrinolytic accord BART protocol . Each anesthesiologist try low central venous pressure ( CVP ) anhepatic phase one third use restrict intravenous fluid infusion approach , phlebotomy without volume replacement combination technique . Phlebotomy consist withdraw blood ( introducer pulmonary artery catheter ) begin ca without crystalloid colloid volume replacement . Criteria phlebotomy : Hb concentration 85 g/L , normal renal function . The quantity blood withdrawn guide patient 's body mass ( 7-10 ml/kg ) . The phlebotomy interrupt arterial blood pressure drop 20 % baseline value spite vasopressor ( phenylephrine norepinephrine ) administration . The CVP slowly correct unclamping inferior vena cava avoid hepatic congestion . The previously withdraw whole blood return patient end surgery need . A cell saver ( CS ) use every case except initial 75 OLTs . Two surgeon involve procedure . Neither venovenous bypass piggyback technique use except case piggyback technique use . During dissection , bleed control almost exclusively electrocautery metallic clip . All liver harvest brain dead donor ABO-Rh compatibles . Statistical Analysis The MELD score determine patient accord equation : 0.957 X Loge creatinine mg/dL + 0.378 X Loge bilirubin mg/dL + 1.120 X Loge INR X 10 ( 14 ) . The MELD score adjust accord period ( 14 ) . The data express mean ± standard deviation mean percentage . Statistical analysis perform use Student 'S T test , Welch T test appropriate . The chi-square test serve compare percentage .</detailed_description>
