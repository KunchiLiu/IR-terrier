	<brief_summary>GSK2981278 highly potent selective inverse agonist retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor gamma ( ROR gamma ) development topical treatment plaque type psoriasis suitable topical therapy . This first study administer GSK2981278 subject psoriasis . This proof-of-concept study evaluate safety , tolerability initial efficacy range concentration GSK2981278 ointment repeat topical application adult subject psoriasis . Results study provide first clinical information drug 's safety efficacy psoriasis inform selection concentration GSK2981278 ointment evaluate subsequent clinical study . This Phase 1 , single center , test field-randomized , vehicle- positive- control , subject- evaluator-blind study . All subject receive 6 treatment 6 test field , intra-individual treatment comparison . For every subject , manner assignment treatment particular test field accord randomization scheme . Thus , test field within subject , subject , randomize . The study consist screening , follow treatment period 19 day , follow-up visit Day 27 ( +/-2 ) subject consent biopsy . During treatment period , subject receive treatment : GSK2981278 ointment 0.03 % weight weight [ w/w ] , 0.1 % w/w , 0.8 % w/w , 4 % w/w , GSK2981278 vehicle , betamethasone valerate 0.1 % cream . The test field treatment apply identify stable plaque ( ) upper extremity , thigh and/or trunk . A blinded evaluator ( investigator designee ) perform measurement assessment whereas unblinded study staff member ( evaluator ) perform biopsy collection .</brief_summary>
