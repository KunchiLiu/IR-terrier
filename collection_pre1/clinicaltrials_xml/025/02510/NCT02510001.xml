	<brief_summary>This trial design try two new cancer drug together first time . The investigator think might effective type bowel cancer . The first part trial see dos two drug safely give together . Once investigator identify suitable dose combination look effective treatment bowel cancer either RAS gene mutate , MET over-active . In trial investigator look sample blood , skin tumour check drug work way expect . The trial take place three site UK 5 site Europe . The trial fund part European commission 's FP7 program .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This two stage study . Firstly dose escalation step use define best dose drug combination , use roll 6 design 6 patient recruit dose level , increase dose one agent accord side effect treatment . An initial dose escalation phase complete 25 patient enrol , use study treatment combination PD-0325901 PF-02341066 . Following discontinuation MEKi ( inihibitor ) , PD-0325901 , study update include dose escalation phase use new combination study treatment , MEKi , Binimetinib METi , PF-02341066 . The effect drug combination assess define recommend dose level dose expansion phase study . Second new drug combination observe 36 patient bowel cancer efficacy tolerability . patient give consent archival tumour sample test RAS c-MET status . Potential participant , give consent , undergo screening test ensure safe take part . These involve detailed medical history , physical exam , blood test , ophthalmology exam , ECG ultrasound skin biopsy . The size extent tumour also assess CT and/or MRI scan . For initial dose escalation phase , assurance test result satisfactory , patient start PD-0325901 first one week . On Day -7 physical exam , ECG blood test perform , repeat blood test Day -6 . End first week PD sample blood take observe level PD-0325901 . Day 1 PF-02341066 introduce clinical safety assessment . There blood sample take 24 hour measure level PD-0325901 PF-02341066 day 21 28 first cycle . For dose escalation phase , assume screen test result satisfactory , patient start Day 1 combine treatment PF-02341066 Binimetinib . A physical exam , ECG blood test perform , repeat blood test Day 2 . There blood sample take 24 hour measure level Binimetinib PF-02341066 day 21of first cycle . Patients weekly visit side effect review physical examination perform . On Day 15 second skin biopsy take along blood test assess liver renal function . At end first 4 week cycle , initial dose escalation phase , end 8 week new combination therapy dose escalation phase , ophthalmology exam compare baseline assessment . For subsequent cycle initial dose escalation dose escalation phase , visit remain weekly include safety assessment per Day 1 . Blood level PD-0325901 Binimetinib PF-02341066 measure day 21 even numbered cycle . In addition tumour size check every second cycle , study treatment stop tumour continue grow . When patient stop take study treatment review 4 week side effect physical examination safety test perform . For patient enter expansion phase trial procedure similar , except pre-screening stage tumour biopsy require . Patients sample tumour assess , follow consent , determine RAS cMET status . This may involve fresh biopsy . If suitable , patient enter screen dose expansion phase fresh tumour biopsy may take already do . The study schedule escalation phase use Binimetinib PF-02341066 . At end treatment , optional , tumour biopsy may take . After trial participation patient offer care trial team refer oncology team appropriate .</detailed_description>

Dose escalation phase : Patients advance solid tumour Patients combination PF02341066 Binimetinib reasonable option . Dose expansion phase : Patients eligible prescreening phase provide : They give inform consent screening . They willing undergo biopsy assessment tumour RAS mutation status cMET assessment . The Investigator anticipate likely satisfy eligibility criteria trial . Formal screening perform tumour prescreening result know . Eligibility trial , patient pass prescreening , require : Histologically confirm colorectal adenocarcinoma RASMT ( KRAS codon 12 , 13 , 61 , 117 , 146 ; NRAS codon 12 , 13 , 61 , 117 , 146 ) mutation ) RASWT/cMET+ , progressive disease within 6 month completion adjuvant therapy chemotherapy and/or target therapy metastatic disease .
