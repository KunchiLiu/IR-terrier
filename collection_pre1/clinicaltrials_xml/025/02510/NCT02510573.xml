	<brief_title>Low Serum Ficolin-3 Levels Admission Are Associated With Poor Outcomes After Severe Traumatic Brain Injury</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Complement activation one pathological mechanism contribute secondary brain injury traumatic brain injury . Ficolin-mediated lectin pathway complement activation contribute pathogenesis ischemic stroke may additive complement-independent inflammatory process . Lower serum ficolin-3 level demonstrate highly associate unfavorable outcome ischemic stroke . This prospective observatory study design investigate relationship serum ficolin-3 level 1-week mortality , 6-month mortality 6-month unfavorable outcome ( defined Glasgow Outcome Scale score 1-3 ) patient severe traumatic brain injury . This study recruit 128 patient 128 sex- age- match healthy control . Serum ficolin-3 level admission measure sandwich immunoassay . It postulate serum ficolin-3 level correlate Glasgow Coma Scale score ficolin-3 identified independent prognostic predictor 1-week mortality , 6-month mortality 6-month unfavorable outcome . Thus , propose low serum ficolin-3 level , correlate injury severity reflect Glasgow Outcome Scale score , potential useful , complementary tool predict short- long- term clinical outcome severe traumatic brain injury .</detailed_description>
