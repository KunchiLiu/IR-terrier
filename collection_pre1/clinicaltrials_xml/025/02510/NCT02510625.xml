Subject Selection The objective study determine glenoid bone graft provide superior functional outcome determine WOSI score Bankart repair patient anterior shoulder instability . This single center , double blind , randomize control trial minimum 200 patient perform Halifax Infirmary , Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre Halifax , Nova Scotia , Canada . The primary outcome measure WOSI score . This validated measure assess quality life patient condition . Secondary outcome subluxation , re-dislocation , strength ROM , validate functional outcome score , include : VR-12 questionnaire , DASH questionnaire , Marx Shoulder Activity Scale ( appendix ) . The ISIS ( instability severity index score ) ( appendix ) score calculate . The Western Ontario Shoulder Instability Index ( WOSI ) tool design self-assessment shoulder function patient instability problem . It disease specific quality life score . Its high sensitivity make able monitor individual patient 's progress . The WOSI score good validity ( 0.768 ) , high degree reliability ( 0.911 ) , high degree responsiveness . The Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey ( VR-12 ) brief , generic , multi-use , self-administered health survey comprise 12 item . It show high internal consistency reliability ( alpha &gt; .80 ) high convergent validity EQ-5D item ( r &gt; .56 ) . . The instrument primarily use measure health-related quality life , estimate disease burden , evaluate disease-specific benchmark . The DASH Outcome Measure 30-item , self-report questionnaire design measure physical function symptom people several musculoskeletal disorder upper limb . DASH stand `` Disabilities Arm , Shoulder Hand . '' In Norweigan study examing shoulder condition reliability show 0.93 Construct validity 0.75 . The tool give clinician researcher advantage single , reliable instrument use assess joint upper extremity . The Marx Shoulder Activity Scale short , easy administer measure shoulder activity use predict outcome shoulder disorder . The activity rating numerical sum score five activity rat five-point frequency scale never perform ( 0 point ) daily ( 4 point ) . The activity scale excellent reliability ( intraclass correlation coefficient 0.92 ) construct validity ( r = 0.66 ) . It complete quickly use conjunction patient-based measure shoulder outcome define patient population cohort study , assess activity level prognostic factor patient shoulder disorder . The ISIS simple score system base factor derive pre-operative questionnaire , physical examination AP radiograph . It may help distinguish patient benefit arthroscopic anterior stabilization use suture anchor . It good reliability ( r &gt; 0.8 ) . The score high validity , patient score six point less acceptable recurrence risk 10 % , therefore potentially good candidate procedure . By contrast , patient six point recurrence risk 70 % . Safety procedure monitor adverse event record . Preoperative CT MRI finding bone loss compare also arthroscopic intra-operative measurement . The investigator hypothesize arthroscopic bone graft glenoid provide superior functional outcome determine WOSI score compare Bankart repair patient anterior shoulder instability . A minimum 200 patient enrol study determine priori sample size calculation . The sample-size calculation base mean WOSI score ( 85 100 ; standard deviation [ SD ] = 20 ) sample 133 patient traumatic anterior shoulder instability follow postoperatively minimum one year . An estimate change ( 10 % change mean WOSI score ) use ensure sufficient sample size power . With use two-sided test , Î± value 0.05 , power 0.90 , sample size determine eighty-six patient per group . This inflated one hundred patient per group account estimate 16.8 % loss follow-up ( value demonstrate study Canadian patient similar characteristic target population ) . Each five surgeon participate study see approximately 40 patient pathology per year , give estimate recruitment time 200 patient one year . Inclusion Criteria 2 document incidence anterior glenohumeral dislocation Exclusion Criteria Uncontrolled diabetes ( Hgb A1C &gt; 7 % Age 16-60 Prior surgery affect shoulder Pregnancy Multidirectional instability Posterior instability Paralysis shoulder Cancer Severe systemic illness Patients recurrent anterior shoulder instability refer orthopedic surgeon Halifax Infirmary Dartmouth General Hospital initially see research coordinator , confirm diagnosis screen patient study eligibility . Following detailed discussion risks/benefits/alternatives study , patient provide copy informed consent review demonstrate interest study . If patient wish enrol study , surgeon research assistant obtain patient consent study accord Division Orthopaedic Surgery Capital District Health Authority ( CDHA ) institutional protocol . Research Plan In pre-operative period , additional time requirement patient , exception inform consent process study . Routine radiograph include AP , axillary , Y view shoulder well pre-operative CT 3D reconstruction MRI obtain patient , standard care patient recurrent shoulder instability . The patient expose additional radiation usual standard care . The patient return clinic complete pre-operative assessment collection baseline data . Structured clinical examination conduct physiotherapist . consist active passive range motion test goniometer well strength test hand dynamometer . The patient also complete baseline questionnaire ( WOSI questionnaire , VR-12 questionnaire , DASH questionnaire , Marx Shoulder Activity Scale ) ISIS score calculate . Any complication event dislocation subluxation record . Primary outcome WOSI score . Secondary outcome subluxation/dislocation , quality life measure functional clinical assessment ( ROM strength ) assess . Randomization For eligible patient meet inclusion criterion , research coordinator obtain informed consent randomly allocate patient one two surgical procedure group : Bankart repair Bankart repair anatomic glenoid reconstruction allograft bone . Randomization base surgeon skill , one surgeon ( Dr. Wong ) perform anatomic glenoid reconstruction , four Surgeons ( Drs . Trenholm , Coady , Urquhart , &amp; Legay ) perform Bankart repair . Allocation determine use computer-generated , variable-block-size randomization consecutively number opaque envelope . Patients meet assign surgeon , discuss repair technique typical clinical context , reconfirm eligibility , address patient concern regard consent randomization . The expertise-based randomization design allow surgeon perform preferred surgical procedure . Two group ( Bankart repair anatomic glenoid reconstruction ) select 100 subject . After patient randomize , treat surgeon final decision exclude patient . Surgical Technique A diagnostic arthroscopy perform accord method describe Snyder ( 2003 ) . The amount glenoid bone loss Hill-Sachs lesion visualize assessed accord standardize protocol use calibrate probe . This technique describe Burkhart . In cadaveric study , show bare spot almost exactly center inferior glenoid , small standard deviation . A calibrated probe introduce posterior portal , distance bare spot posterior glenoid rim measure . The surgeon infers pre-dislocation intact measurement bare spot anterior glenoid rim would posterior measurement . The surgeon use calibrate probe measure distance bare spot anterior glenoid rim . Hill-Sachs lesion also measure documented photography . Intraoperative photo video record technique , photograph review independent observer . The measurement quantify independent observer remove observer bias . Any bone loss identify , quantify , compare pre-operative CT MRI . Bankart Repair Arthroscopic Bankart repair procedure perform accord individual surgeon 's usual technique . Procedures perform patient lateral beach-chair position . Repairs associate conjoined superior labral anterior-to-posterior ( SLAP ) tear document perform surgeon 's discretion . Labral detachment repair use suture-anchor fixation arthroscopic tie technique . Either two three suture anchor use . Capsular redundancy address arthroscopic suture plication surgeon 's discretion . Surgeons mobilize capsulolabral tissue deem necessary . Surgical time video operation record , photograph take document bone loss . Anatomic Glenoid Reconstruction The surgical technique lateral decubitus all-arthroscopic anatomic glenoid reconstruction procedure treatment anterior shoulder instability describe Wong et al .
