	<brief_title>Tolerability , Safety Efficacy Lubricin Eye Drops Versus Sodium Hyaluronate Eye Drops Subjects With Moderate Dry Eye</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dry eye , keratoconjunctivitis sicca , chronic inflammatory condition ocular surface may cause severe symptom visual impairment . The 2007 international dry eye workshop ( DEWS ) define disease follow : `` Dry eye multifactorial disease tear ocular surface result symptoms discomfort , visual disturbance , tear film instability potential damage ocular surface . It accompany increase osmolarity tear film inflammation ocular surface '' . Lubricin mucin-like glycoprotein originally discover synovial fluid , secrete product cell line joint tissue , present surface articular cartilage . In vitro study show lubricin saline buffer act lubricant various surface , well synovial fluid , provide evidence lubricin principal lubricate protein joint . Besides lubricate property , lubricin show exert anti-adhesive action , strain energy dissipation , protective effect underlie cell . Lubricin investigate role ocular surface , normal pathologic condition dry eye . In fact , Lubricin natural human protein potent lubricant anti-adhesive property present ocular surface meibonian gland . The presence protein ocular surface first describe team Sullivan D. Based available preclinical lubricin study may important barrier development corneal conjunctival epitheliopathies dry eye use novel lubricate anti-adhesive eye drop investigation clinical investigation . This clinical investigation design demonstrate Lubricin 150 µg/ml eye drop formulation non-inferior currently most-widely use ocular surface lubricant sodium hyaluronate 0.13 % improve sign symptom patient moderate dry eye . Up , know anticipated adverse event associate use lubricin , anyway occurrence side effect exclude . It must consider topical treatment lubricin hyaluronic acid could cause local irritation allergic reaction . There known contraindication use lubricin hyaluronic acid eye drop . All examination assessment carry study non-invasive , commonly use management subject dry eye pose risk subject . There known contraindication use lubricin hyaluronic acid eye drop . No data available embryo fetal toxicity , therefore experimental treatment allow pregnant woman nurse mother woman childbearing potential use appropriate birth control method .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To check screen visit ( V1 ) day 14 day 8 day runin period confirm baseline visit ( V2 ) : 1 . Subjects 18 year age old . 2 . Subjects moderate dry eye characterize tear film osmolarity &gt; 312 mOsm 3 . Subjects VAS frequency severity symptom , SANDE item , screen &amp; baseline &gt; 25 mm ( SANDE overall score &gt; 25 mm ) . 4 . Subjects moderate dry eye characterize least one eye sign symptom moderate dry eye ( grade 2 3 2007 DEWS report ) 5 . Subjects diagnose dry eye least 6 month ( current use recommend use artificial tears/lubricants treatment Dry Eye ) 6 . Best correct distance visual acuity ( BCDVA ) score ≥ 0.1 decimal unit eye time study enrolment . 7 . The Informed Consent approve Ethics Committees sign subject study procedure . 1 . Evidence active ocular infection either eye 2 . History presence ocular surface disorder related dry eye either eye 3 . History evidence eyelid abnormality either eye 4 . Use topical cyclosporine , topical corticosteroid topical medication treatment dry eye either eye within 30 day study enrolment 5 . History ocular surgery ( include laser refractive surgical procedure ) either eye within 90 day study enrolment . Ocular surgery allow study treatment period elective ocular surgery procedure plan duration followup period 6 . Presence history ocular systemic disorder condition might significantly hinder efficacy study treatment evaluation , could possibly interfere interpretation study result , could judge investigator incompatible study visit schedule conduct trail procedure ( e.g . ocular trauma , progressive degenerative corneal condition , uveitis , systemic vasculitis , collagen vascular disease , poorly control diabetes , autoimmune disease , systemic infection . ) 7 . Known hypersensitivity one component study procedural medication 8 . Participation another clinical study time present study within 90 day baseline visit 9 . History drug , medication alcohol abuse addiction . 10 . Females childbearing potential ( surgically sterilize postmenopausal least 1 year ) exclude participation study meet one follow condition : currently pregnant , positive result urine pregnancy test Screening/Baseline Visit , intend become pregnant study treatment period , breastfeeding , willing use highly effective birth control measure , : Hormonal contraceptive oral , implanted , transdermal , injected and/or mechanical barrier method spermicide conjunction barrier condom diaphragm IUD entire course 30 day study treatment period .</criteria>
