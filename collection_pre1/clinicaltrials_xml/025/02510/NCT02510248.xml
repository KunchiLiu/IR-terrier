	<brief_summary>This Phase 1 , randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , first-in-human , 3-part study safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics orally administer AL-704 assess healthy adult subject adult subject CHC infection . Part 1 : Healthy adult subject receive one 5 single ascend oral dos ( SAD ) AL-704 range 100 mg 1,500 mg ( Cohorts 1 5 ) . Within cohort subject randomize receive either AL-704 placebo ( n=8 per cohort ; 6 assign AL-704 2 assign placebo ) , fast state . The planned dose-escalation scheme may change base emerge PK safety data . Two additional cohort ( Cohorts 6 7 ) may enrol evaluation additional dos discretion Sponsor Investigator , base emerge pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile , presence acceptable safety profile . Part 2 : To assess food effect pharmacokinetics , 8 healthy subject one full Part 1 cohort receive single dose AL-704 placebo fast state , receive single dose AL-704 placebo fed state Part 2 washout period 7-14 day ( depend PK result ) . It expect Cohort 3 Part 1 ( 600 mg dose ) select , however depend evaluation available PK safety data Part 1 study . Part 3 : The following cohort 10 adult subject , CHC infection , evaluate . Subjects CHC genotype 1 infection ( Cohorts 8 10 ) subject CHC genotype 3 infection ( Cohort 11 ) randomize receive AL-704 placebo 7 consecutive day ( n=10 per cohort , 8 assign AL-704 2 assign placebo ) fed state . The treatment anticipate administered daily dose regimen twice daily dose regimen . The dose dose regimen administer determined Sponsor depend PK safety outcomes previous cohort .</brief_summary>
