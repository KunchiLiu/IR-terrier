	<brief_summary>Syndromic obesity rare form obesity ( 1 % case ) , involve severe obesity early multi organ involvement ( mental retardation , dysmorphic , sensorineural damage / endocrine ) . To date , genetic defect identify 5 % case ( Prader-Willi syndrome , Bardet-Biedl syndrome , mutation leptin receptor , proconvertase-1 , proopiomelanocortin SIM-1 TRKB gene , high resolution karyotype abnormal DNA chip , ... ) . Precocity severity obesity little dependent genetic environment . The investigator aim identify new gene variant subject syndromic obesity share common phenotypic feature .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phenotypic Genotypic Characterization Subjects With Syndromic Obesity : Identifying New Candidate Genes Exome Sequencing ( OBEXOME )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Sequencing exon : To date , syndromic obesity elucidate . But , lack identification molecular abnormality involve limit information family risk recurrence optimal support patient . A new molecular biology tool call sequencing exon ( `` exome '' ) target sequence subset genome code protein show power identify mutation responsible rare disease , small number individual achieve unrelated . Indeed , tool help identify two mutation gene TSPAN12 ( Tetraspanin 12 ) 23 subject exudative vitreo-retinopathy , 3 mutation gene PRRT2 ( proline-rich transmembrane protein 2 ) 8 Chinese family kinesigenic paroxysmal dyskinesia , 2 nonsense mutation gene ANGPTL3 ( angiopoietin-like 3 ) 2 subject familial combined hypolipidemia , mutation gene RBM10 ( RNA bind motif 10 ) 3 patient syndromic form cleft palate ( TARP syndrome ) mutation gene PALB2 ( partner localizer BRCA2 ) patient pancreatic cancer . The investigator believe tool could identify new molecular abnormality individual syndromic obesity . The detailed analysis phenotypic data could identify group obese patient ( least 10 ) share clinical biological phenotype technique would use . The exome sequencing conduct subject select phenotype also among relative ( 2 parent sibling ) provide additional discriminative capacity . Every new variant find homozygous state obese patient unaffected relative immediately exclude list candidate mutation . Conversely , variant find patient absent parent sibling potential de novo mutation . The presence variant candidate seek different exome public database ( dbSNP , 1000 Genomes , Exome Variant Server ) , case unlisted variant , possible genotype cohort child common obesity non-obese order determine frequency thus provide additional information potential involvement syndromic obesity phenotype . The last step validate role variant gene clinical picture vitro analysis functional consequence protein vivo animal model . The sequencing exon ( `` exomes '' ) 40 select subject ( 10 probands parent non-obese sibling ) perform genomic platform use new type generation sequencer Illumina HiSeq 2000 . To , DNA 3μg ( 15μL concentration 200 ng/uL ) need per sample sequence type `` paired-end '' 2 x 75bp . The generated sequence align reference genome ( build hg19 ) use BWA Software . Duplicates ( PCR duplicate ' 'optical duplicate ' ) eliminate non-paired misaligned sequence ( Q-score &lt; 20 ) . The generated sequence recalibrated GATK software improve detection variation insertion / deletion . Detecting variant carry use tool software annotation use annovar software . Analyzes focus detect variant depth least 10x . The investigator select variant find homozygous state patient heterozygous state parent ( recessive hypothesis ) . Variants also find homozygous among unaffected relative exclude list candidate . Any variant found patient absent parent may also potential candidate case de novo The investigator believe strategy could facilitate diagnosis also , validation role variant pathology , ass risk recurrence family offer prenatal diagnosis necessary . It also provide support early possible child , like medical , psychological social care child Prader-Willi syndrome . Indeed , existence genetic diagnosis responsible phenotype allow development specific life project adapt patient facilitates development aid disability reference center collaboration departmental home disabled people ( MDPH ) . Finally , progress understanding mechanisms obesity may help good understand pathophysiology common form obesity improve management . Patient Selection : For child adult syndromic obesity , day hospitalization systematically plan usual care perform complete clinical biological assessment . The information various examination make day hospitalization give consultation . The genetic study propose It propose consultation patient , child adult , family . The hospitalization date usually month follow consultation . Inclusion - patient day hospitalization : As part usual care , precise phenotypic characterization perform investigator day hospitalization : family weight history , retrospective analysis personal weight history , clinical examination , anthropometry , dietary consultation , measure body composition expenditure energy rest , food physical activity questionnaire , endocrine metabolic balance . The research consist blood sample 20 mL extra genetic study conduct obese subject sign consent . Patients analyzable sample already store DNA bank No . DC2009-957 sample .</detailed_description>
