	<brief_summary>The objective study image retinal vascular alteration patient retinal disease use AngioVue OCT-A system understand information image provide . The investigator image study participant retinal disease AngioVue unit ( Optovue ) collect relevant clinical data understand nature information contain image obtain AngioVue . This study conduct abbreviated IDE . The investigator analyze data use descriptive statistic . Risks related light exposure manage ensure exposure AngioVue light source well maximum permissible limit safe exposure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>SD-OCT Angiography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OCT optical range imaging technique first describe 1991 since use successfully provide high-resolution , micrometer-scale depth image clinical ophthalmology ( field ) . It think optical analogue ultrasound image . For ocular posterior segment , OCT provide rapid acquisition high-resolution , cross-sectional image retina approximate tissue histology . In vivo image retina OCT thus dramatically improve clinician ' diagnostic capability , allow earlier accurate diagnosis disease precise assessment response therapy time . While OCT provide important information retinal anatomy , currently limit ability provide information retinal vasculature blood flow . Angiography current gold-standard imaging modality retinal vascular imaging . Angiography involve intravenous injection fluorescent dye ( typically either fluorescein indocyanine green retinal choroidal vessel , respectively ) circulate body . A light source emit light specific excitation wavelength dye place front patient 's eye , camera equip filter correspond emission wavelength dye use image vessel morphology retinal perfusion , either still image short movie . Angiography provide physiologic information retina complement anatomical information provide OCT . While generally well tolerated patient , angiography drawback : often require use separate imaging system , require several minute image acquisition , involve intravenous injection dye . Patients occasionally experience side effect intravenous dye administration , include nausea , discomfort , rarely , anaphylaxis . Several retinal imaging company develop next generation OCT technology : OCT angiography ( OCT-A ) . OCT-A allows noninvasive , high-resolution imaging microvasculature retina choroid ( vascular plexus subjacent retina ) , without need intravenous dye administration . OCT-A platform currently development include spectral domain ( SD ) swept-source ( SS ) base technology . Whereas SS-based OCT-A utilizes long wavelength ( ~1060 nm ) light source , SD-based unit use light source use commercially available FDA-cleared OCT unit modify platform . Optovue , Inc. ( Fremont , CA ) develop one unit , customize , high-resolution SD-OCT system implement novel algorithm , amplitude-based method split-spectrum amplitude-decorrelation angiography ( SSADA ) OCT-A . This SSADA algorithm allow detection motion blood vessel lumen measure variation reflect OCT signal amplitude consecutive cross-sectional scan . Optovue integrate novel SSADA algorithm commercially approve RTVue SD-OCT unit OCT-A unit , AngioVue . The AngioVue generate high-quality angiogram retina choroid . Additionally , refine method produce image smallest retinal vessel ( capillary ) normal healthy control participant . In proposed prospective interactive clinical study , use AngioVue unit image patient characterize vascular abnormality present set retinal disease .</detailed_description>
