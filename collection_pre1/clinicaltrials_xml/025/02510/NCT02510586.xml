	<brief_title>Sevoflurane Hyperperfusion Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Postoperative hyperperfusion syndrome common complication moyamoya disease patient receive revascularization surgery . Previously incidence report 17~50 % , little remain regard frequency reperfusion injury revascularization surgery patient moyamoya disease . Volatile anesthetic sevoflurane introduce clinically reduce reperfusion injury precondition sevoflurane induce ischemic tolerance like ischemic preconditioning . However , report neuroprotective effect sevoflurane postconditioning ischemic/reperfusion injury human brain . Therefore , We evaluate neuroprotective effect sevoflurane postconditioning incidence postoperative hyperperfusion syndrome revascularization surgery moyamoya disease patient .</detailed_description>
