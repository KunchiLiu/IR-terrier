	<detailed_description>Dengue infection resurge disseminate globally since late 1970s successful eradication program dengue vector Aedes mosquitoes Latin America 1940s . It identify fast spread mosquito-borne viral disease World Health Organization ( WHO ) , affect 2.5 billion people live subtropical tropical region . Approximately 75 % current global dengue disease burden come population reside Southeast Asia Western Pacific region , subsequently lead formation Asia Pacific Dengue Strategic Plan ( 2008-2015 ) recent Global Strategy Prevention Control ( 2012-2020 ) reduce dengue burden . Malaysia hyper-endemic four dengue virus serotypes circulate responsible escalate number case year . The number report dengue case Malaysia increase fourfold 44.3 per 100,000 population 1999 181 per 100,000 2007 ; increase dengue death adult population since 2002 . Worst still , 28 February 2015 , 62 death secondary dengue infection report Malaysia ; total number dengue case report period 23,966 46 % high reporting period 2014 . The WHO revise dengue classification 2009 , show sensitive WHO 1997 classification system predict severity dengue . According WHO 2009 classification , dengue infection categorize dengue , dengue warning sign , severe dengue . The proposed warning sign include abdominal pain tenderness , persistent vomiting , clinical fluid accumulation , mucosal bleed , lethargy restlessness , liver enlargement &gt; 2cm , increase hematocrit concurrent rapid decrease platelet count . Severe dengue define dengue infection severe plasma leakage shock , severe bleed severe organ involvement . Although large number patient may recover self-limiting disease , small proportion may progress develop severe dengue manifestation , require admission intensive care unit ( ICU ) closer monitor intervention . However , progression severe clinical manifestation usually unpredictable . Early identification sign predict severe dengue may save life facilitate early initiation intervention frequent monitoring . Dengue epidemic Malaysia lead strong demand hospital bed manpower , inflict large public private hospitalization cost . Hence , crucial determine predictive tool help triage patient least likely develop complication order good allocation limit healthcare resource . A study do validate utility propose warn sign WHO 2009 dengue classification , result vary none study conduct local setting . Although dengue virus identify many year plenty research work carry , proven still many aspect sure disease . It get confused sudden surge dengue case dengue mortality case since last year . Therefore , study aim look clinical course hospitalize dengue case Malaysia . It allow u zoom specific area future research work . General Objective : To study clinical course hospitalize dengue case Malaysia year 2009 till 2015 . Specific Objectives : 1 . Describe characteristic patient hospitalize dengue 2 . Describe clinical presentation patient hospitalize dengue 3 . Verify diagnosis report dengue case 4 . Describe spectrum disease severity among patient hospitalize dengue 5 . Describe management patient hospitalize dengue include ICU care 6 . Describe prognosis patient hospitalize dengue 7 . Estimate resource utilization cost care patient hospitalize dengue 8 . Estimate mortality outcome patient hospitalize dengue This multi-center , observational cohort study design investigate clinical course patient hospitalize dengue infection Malaysia . This study conduct 2 stage duration 6 month . Data retrieve retrospectively stage . In Stage 1 , sample dengue case visit general practitioner hospitalize year 2009 2015 sample use PIK Health insurance claim database sample frame . Each hospital give list dengue case local coordinator respective hospital Clinical Research Centre ( CRC ) trace medical record dengue case . Once case note dengue case trace , two train research assistant travel hospital extract basic clinical data social demographic , presentation discharge status use case report form A . All data collect phase 1 categorize basic clinical set . In Stage 2 , subset basic clinical set sample conveniently . Only case test positive dengue non-structural protein 1 ( NS1 ) , immunoglobulin-M ( IgM ) high-titre immunoglobulin-G ( IgG ) include Stage 2 study . A detailed clinical subset data collect research assistant site . All co-morbidity , serial clinical laboratory data , in-hospital course treatment data Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) admission data extract medical record case report form B . All variables/data case report form define Appendix I . All data collect Stage 1 2 compile analyze software Stata Version 10.0. WHO 2009 classification adopt study . According WHO 2009 criterion , probable dengue define fever two follow : nausea vomiting , rash , ache pain , leucopenia , warn sign . Warning sign abdominal pain tenderness , persistent vomiting , clinical fluid accumulation , mucosal bleed , lethargy restlessness , hepatomegaly hematocrit change ≥20 % concurrent platelet &lt; 50,000 day . Severe dengue present follow criterion fulfil : I ) Plasma leakage evidence hematocrit change ≥20 % , pleural effusion ascites , hypoproteinemia , lead : - Dengue shock syndrome ( tachycardia , cold clammy extremity , capillary refill time great 3 second , weak undetectable pulse , narrow pulse pressure ≤20 mmHg , systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 millimetre mercury ( mmHg ) unrecordable blood pressure ) ; - Fluid accumulation respiratory distress ( respiratory rate ≥30/minute , oxygen saturation ≤92 % room air , mechanical ventilation ) II ) Severe bleed manifest gastrointestinal bleeding menorrhagia , requirement transfusion pack red blood cell whole blood . III ) Severe organ involvement follow : - Serum alanine aspartate transaminase ≥1000 units/L ; - Impaired consciousness ; - Acute renal impairment define serum creatinine &gt; two time upper limit normal ; - Myocarditis encephalopathy/encephalitis</detailed_description>
