	<brief_summary>Early detection viable residual tumor early neoplastic recurrence represent real challenge monitoring patient treat concomitant chemoradiotherapy squamous cell carcinoma upper aerodigestive tract . The locoregional recurrence rate indeed high ( 40 % ) first two year therapeutic method . The conventional imaging method CT MRI appear limited term sensitivity many post-treatment change fibrosis , tissue edema tissue distortion . PET-CT 18F-FDG prof non-invasive , reliable detection residual tumor metastasis , even absence clinical sign . To date , acquire CT examination time position PET perform without iodinate contrast injection , use anatomical identification attenuation correction PET fuse image . The patient usually second CT imaging , center neck contrast injection iodize within radiology department . To date , team yet study interest PET-CT 18F-FDG couple CT scan contrast injection iodize diagnosis early recurrence head neck malignancy interest contrast agent injection demonstrate ovarian neoplastic recurrence research , pancreatic colon .</brief_summary>
