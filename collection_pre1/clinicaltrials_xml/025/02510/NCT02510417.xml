	<brief_summary>The primary purpose study evaluate whether closely HLA-matched multivirus-specific T cell line obtain bank allogeneic virus-specific T cell line ( VSTs ) antiviral activity three virus : EBV , CMV adenovirus . Reconstitution anti-viral immunity donor-derived VSTs show promise prevent treat infection associate CMV , EBV adenovirus post-transplant . However , time take prepare patient-specific product lack virus-specific memory T cell cord blood seronegative donor , limit value . An alternative use bank partially HLA-matched allogeneic VSTs . A prior phase II study institution use trivirus-specific VSTs generate use monocyte EBV-transformed B cell gene-modified clinical grade adenoviral vector express CMV-pp65 activate expand specific T cell show feasibility , safety activity approach treatment refractory CMV , EBV Adenovirus infection . However , production process lengthy , require 8-12 week , exposure biohazard ( B95.8 EBV viral strain adenovector ) , antigenic competition different viral component preclude increase spectrum specificity beyond three virus . Investigator overcome limitation current trial , evaluate whether rapidly generate , allogeneic closely HLA-matched multivirus-specific VSTs , activate use overlap peptide library span immunogenic antigen CMV , adenovirus EBV safe produce anti-viral effect allogeneic HSCT recipient infect one target virus persistent despite conventional anti-viral therapy . The study agent assess safety ( stop rule define ) antiviral activity .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Investigators evaluate clinical utility Multivirus VSTs recipient match related , match unrelated , haploidentical donor transplant . To date , 10 clinical-grade multivirus-directed VSTs generate donor PBMCs . These line polyclonal , comprise CD4+ ( 57±5 % ) CD8+ ( 35±5 % ) cell retain expression memory marker CD45RO+CD62L+ ( 58±8 % ) . Their specificity dependent prior viral exposure cell donor ; 7/8 test line activity Adv,8/8 CMV , 6/8 EBV . None line react recipient PHA blast - indicate lack alloreactive potential rapidly generate line . Investigators administer multivirus-specific donor-derived VSTs 3 allogeneic HSCT recipient dose escalation study DL1 ( 5x106/m2 ) . There immediate infusion toxicity , de novo acute GvHD , demonstrate vivo safety mVST . Further , antiviral efficacy observe 1 patient refractory CMV . In addition , recently publish paper Baylor College Medicien ( Anapoulous et al , STM 2014 ) treat VSTs manufacture similar methodology , target 5 virus instead 3 specificity BK virus HHV6 . In study 10 patient treat 4 DL1 ( 5x10e6/m2 ) , 4 DL2 ( 1x10e7/m2 ) 2 DL3 ( 2x10e7/m2 ) saw immediate infusion toxicity , de novo acute GvHD , demonstrate vivo safety mVST . Three patient receive cell viral prophylaxis ( day 38-43 post-HSCT ) none develop viral infection 3 month post-treatment . The 7 patient received cell treatment one active infection day 59-139 post-HSCT . Based viral load measurement day 42 post-infusion , VSTs successful control active infection CMV ( 1 complete ( CR ) 1 partial response ( PR ) ) , EBV ( 2 CRs , include case frank PTLD ) ; Adv ( 1 CR ) ; HHV6 ( 1 CR ) ; BK ( 3 CR , 1 PR , 1NR ) . Of note , 3 BK virus responder tissue disease severe hemorrhagic cystitis mark improvement disappearance hematuria follow infusion . One patient subsequently episode transient severe bladder pain association inflammation see cytoscopy coincident 6 log fall urine BK viral load . Only non-responder patient BK infection whose line lack activity virus , likely reflect serostatus donor . In addition , 3 patient subsequently reactivate virus initially treat , clear infection week 12 , without requirement additional cell infusion ( CMV : 1CR ; EBV : 1CR ; BK : 1CR ; HHV6 : 1CR ) . Finally , 1 patient receive multivirus specific VSTs single patient protocol emergency treatment widespread bulky rituximab-resistant EBV-PTLD . Post VST treatment immediate decline patient 's EBV viral load complete sustain resolution PTLD , coincident increase circulate EBV-specific T cell . However , profound anti-tumor activity mediate rapidly-expanding EBV-directed T cell also produce transient systemic inflammatory response syndrome , control steroid anti-TNFR antibody , long term adverse effect . Thus , infusion donor-derived , multivirus specific VSTs generate clinical grade pepmixes infuse either prophylactically treatment one viral infection safe associate appearance virus-reactive T cell peripheral blood able control infection mention virus .</detailed_description>
