	<brief_title>Safety PK Study CC-90001 Subjects With Pulmonary Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , stagger dose-escalation , cohort expansion study enroll subject multiple study site United States America ( USA ) Australia . The study consist two treatment arm : - Low dose ( 100 mg ) CC-90001 administer orally daily ( QD ) 12 continuous week . - High dose ( 200 mg ) CC-90001 administer orally QD 12 continuous week . The high dose ( 200 mg ) CC-90001 arm start least three subject complete minimum 2 week low-dose CC 90001 low dose treatment arm determine meet study dose escalation stop criterion ( Figure 2 ) . Each subject participate Screening ( 4 week prior treatment ) , 12 week Treatment Phase , 4-week Follow-up visit . Subjects screen eligibility . Subjects meet inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion Screening return study site Day 1 assessment begin administration QD dose CC 90001 , accord dose level subject enrol . Three subject initially enrol receive low dose CC-90001 ( 100 mg QD ) , evaluate scheduled assessment 12 week treatment . Once total three subject complete Week 2 visit , decision continue study high dose level ( 200 mg QD ) determine . If criteria escalation high dose ( CC-90001 200 mg QD ) meet , low dose ( CC-90001 100 mg QD ) subject remain low dose ( CC-90001 100 mg QD ) six additional subject enrol high dose level ( CC-90001 200 mg QD ) . If one three subject low dose ( CC-90001 100 mg QD ) experience event meet individual subject dose stop criterion , another three subject enrol low dose arm . Dose escalation high dose ( CC-90001 200 mg QD ) occur two six subject meet individual subject dose stop criterion . All subject ( low high dose ) remain CC-90001 total 12 week unless individual subject experience event meet individual subject stop criterion . In addition , dose CC-90001 may reduce CC-90001 200 mg QD CC-90001 100 mg QD ) individual meet individual subject dose reduction criterion . If two subject high dose ( CC-90001 200 mg QD ) arm experience event meet individual stop criterion , 100 mg QD dose arm may repeat three additional subject , study may stop . Study visit occur Screening , Day 1 , Weeks 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 16 ( Follow-up visit ) . Blood urine sample collect specified time clinical safety laboratory assessment , pharmacokinetic analysis ( drug affect body ) , pharmacodynamic analysis ( body affect drug ) . Safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
