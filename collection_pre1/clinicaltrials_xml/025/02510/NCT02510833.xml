The GIC meeting individualized approach ( physical therapist , patient companion ) guidance home physical therapy exercise , use Manual Pró-Parkinson , participant receive manual stretching exercise , mobility , balance strength , lead home way guide activity ; receive weekly follow-up phone call ( remember exercise , answer question encourage continued practice ) . GC may attend presentation home exercise Pro-Parkinson 's manual day query manual without remote follow-up phone call , usual service procedure . Exercises orient perform three time week 12 week effect anti-Parkinson medication .

	<detailed_description>Type Study : Randomized control clinical trial . Hypothesis : Program-oriented home therapeutic exercise individualize approach weekly monitoring physical therapist contributes improvement sign symptoms Parkinson 's disease quality life . Primary objective : To evaluate impact home therapeutic exercise orient people Parkinson 's disease . Secondary objective : - To investigate knowledge , attitude practice home therapeutic exercise orient study population ; - Identify adhesion barrier related exercise program ; - Evaluate impact home-based therapeutic exercise daily activity , motor exploration quality life Parkinson 's disease . Proposed Methodology : Participants informed nature purpose study . Then meet eligibility criterion wish participate , sign Consent Agreement Informed ( IC ) . The study conduct Pró-Parkinson Program Hospital das Clinicas , Federal University Pernambuco ( UFPE ) , Neurology Clinic , December/ 2014 September/2015 . Will applicable 12 week intervention ( medication ON period ) : Survey Knowledge , Attitudes Practice ; Questionnaire Accession ; Unified Scale Evaluation Parkinson 's disease ( UPDRS ) - subscales II III ; Parkinson 's Disease Questionnaire 39 ( PDQ-39 ) . Participants randomize two group : Group continue intervention ( GIC ) control group ( CG ) . GIC- Initially , physiotherapist , member Pró-Parkinson Program responsible research , guide train individual patient companion physiotherapy exercise present illustrative manual Pro-Parkinson . Also , lecture therapeutic exercise medical consultation day . The exercise perform home three time week ( every day ) maximum duration 60 minute session 12 week always influence anti-Parkinsonian medication ( ON period medication ) . After meeting , receive manual , yet available , daily exercise . In diary , participant caregiver write exercise , report day , time , hold difficulty subsequent control responsible researcher . Participants receive weekly call physiotherapist agree time participant / caregiver , remind exercise , answer question encourage continue practice . It emphasize participant caregiver able write diary , data question researcher weekly phone call , without prejudice control . Physiotherapist phone number available participant daily exercise . GC- participant accompany person may attend lecture service ( include Physical Therapy ) manual , without subsequent weekly follow-up phone call , usual service procedure . The lecture take place every Wednesday day consultation , two meeting / month physiotherapy team . These maximum duration 40 minute patient caregiver instruct trained manual physical therapy exercise home three time week maximum duration 60 minute session always influence anti-Parkinsonian drug ( ON period medication ) . At end talk , manual available . The lecture give physiotherapist , properly train , Pro-Parkinson Program member . The Pro-Parkinson manual , distribute program since 2012 , cover chapter exercise guideline medical area , physiotherapy , speech therapy , occupational therapy dentistry . The physiotherapy section ( page 10-21 ) include stretch exercise , mobility , balance strength , plus guideline . It general instruction exercise ; sequence describing , self-explanatory illustration number set reps / maintenance time realize . All exercise design could carry independently safely patient 's home . Patients instructed make clothes let free knee sneaker shoe ( jump 2 cm ) attach ankle . The exercise supervise patient caregiver , necessary . Risks : With regard questionnaire , may risk embarrassment . To minimize , data collection hold individually enable environment data confidentiality . If refuse answer question , insistence , well damage participant . Pain , muscle discomfort fatigue may occur exercise , however , patient advise discontinue exercise try case consider unbearable pain . To minimize risk , whole exercise program guide hold range motion pain-free intensity safety . During exercise , also change cardiorespiratory parameter blood pressure respiratory rate . In attempt minimize risk , participate study submit change blood pressure level heart rate respiratory consider beyond normal . Benefits : The direction study bring direct benefit patient attend service order population resource finance rehabilitation treatment , little access service patient state . This diagnosis study population describe Coriolanos et al . ( 2013 ) describe epidemiological profile patient PD HC/UFPE . Moreover , result contribute evidence-based therapeutic practice literary collection , foster new study . Data Analysis Methodology : All study collection hold Pró-Parkinson Program Hospital das Clinicas , Federal University Pernambuco ( UFPE ) , Neurology Clinic , variable evaluate responsible employee physiotherapist , undergo period training . Outcomes analyzed use statistical software SPSS version 16.0 ( SPSS Inc , Chicago , IL , USA ) . To verify normality sample , Shapiro-Wilk test use . Upon proof normality , result intervention compare within group , pair analysis , mean Wilcoxon test intergroup , independent analysis , use Mann-Whitney test . To analyze result Survey CAP Adhesion , descriptive statistic frequency calculation make , high-low , median , mean , standard deviation . The significance level 0.05 analysis . Datas image photograph store personal computer responsible physical therapist counselor , two copy CD compact disc/DVD . The responsibility confidentiality data responsible physiotherapist . Sample Size Brazil : 28 ( 14 intervention group 14 control ) . To carry sample size calculation , investigator use statistical program PASS ( Power Analysis Sample Size ) , version 2005 . After simulation , investigator choose minimum sample size 14 patient control group 14 intervention group , total 28 patient . This number capable detecting , 82 % test power 5 % significance level , reduction 3 point PDQ-39 scale UPDRS-Motor intervention group compare reduction control group , use one-tailed parametric non-parametric test independent sample , consider standard deviation reduction order 3 point two group . For calculation , mean standard deviation parameter expect base study Lun et al . ( 2005 ) , Dereli Yaliman ( 2010 ) , Navarro-Peternella Marcon ( 2012 ) , well clinical experience Pró-Parkinson .</detailed_description>
