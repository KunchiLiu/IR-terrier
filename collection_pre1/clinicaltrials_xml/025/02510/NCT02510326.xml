	<brief_summary>The scaphotrapeziotrapezoid ( STT ) joint dome shape joint radial wrist important transfer load thumb radial hand scaphoid radioscaphoid scaphocapitate joint . Arthritis joint second common degenerative arthritis wrist , report 15 % wrist radiograph . The true incidence arthritis STT joint however unknown though assume case arthritis clinically significant . Furthermore , clinical biomechanical significance arthritis joint unclear . The investigator ' clinical impression incidence STT joint arthritis inversely related radiocarpal joint arthritis . In ongoing study , examine relationship STT joint arthritis radiocarpal joint arthritis radiograph . We suggest STT joint arthritis alters biomechanics wrist limit movement scaphoid within STT joint thereby protect wrist radiocarpal arthritis limit instability scaphoid . The specific aim pilot study evaluate movement arthritic scaphoid within STT joint use computer-generated model base CT scan wrist compare model already establish model normal STT joint . The investigator ' hypothesis significantly less motion arthritic STT joint .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Because poorly understood , treatment wrist arthritis remain limited suboptimal salvage operation wrist fusion . These surgery , greatly limit function . This study design evaluate arthritis STT joint affect arthritis part wrist . This may improve understand wrist mechanic enable u develop well treatment wrist arthritis . STT joint arthrodesis accept surgery whose indication may influence information obtain study . Five patient treat PI diagnosis find STT joint arthritis stage 3 X-ray include study . The radiographs standard care various hand wrist condition patient send radiographs part care . The patient eligible study follow informed consent . The CT scan perform 5-7 wrist position : neutral , maximum extension , flexion , radial deviation , ulnar deviation ( plus radial extension ulnar flexion 7 position ) . Slice thickness le 1 mm . The slice locate distal radioulnar joint ( DRUJ ) 2nd carpometacarpal ( CMC ) joint . The CT scan send evaluation computer base kinematic program . No identifiable information collect record . The program develop kinematic model STT joint presence arthritis . The model ( kinematic data ) compare existent `` normal '' model , base 7 CT scan normal STT joint . This data already existence therefore normal wrist accrue .</detailed_description>
