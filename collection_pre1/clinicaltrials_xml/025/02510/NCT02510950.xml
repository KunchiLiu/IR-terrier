	<brief_summary>The early clinical development paradigm chemotherapeutic agent significantly influence development therapeutic cancer vaccine . However , major difference two class therapeutic important implication early clinical development . Specifically , phase 1 concept dose escalation find maximum-tolerated dose apply therapeutic cancer vaccine . Most therapeutic cancer vaccine associate minimal toxicity range feasible manufacture administer , little reason believe maximum-tolerated dose effective dose . In recent article biostatistics literature , Simon et al . write `` initial clinical trial many new vaccine toxicity dose-ranging trial rather involve administration fix dose vaccine … case dose select base preclinical finding practical consideration . Using several dose level initial study find minimal active dose characterize dose-activity relationship generally realistic '' . Consistent recommendation , general philosophy phase 1 clinical trial facilitate prompt preliminary evaluation safety immunogenicity personalize synthetic long peptide vaccine strategy . The proposed clinical trial test fix dose vaccine . There considerable experience synthetic long peptide vaccine platform . The synthetic long peptide vaccine platform excellent safety profile , optimal dose appear base practical consideration ( solubility peptide ) . The dose test proposed clinical trial consistent similar cancer vaccine trial recently complete currently ongoing . The sample size ( n=10 ) provide reasonably reliable estimate safety immunogenicity vaccine .</brief_summary>

Patients craniotomy biopsy , subtotal resection , total gross resection , reresection permit . Consented genome sequencing dbGaPbased data share provide provide germline ( PBMC ) tumor DNA/RNA sample adequate quality sequencing . ( Acquisition specimens sequence sequence may do study part routine care another research project . ) At least 18 year age . Karnofsky performance status ≥ 60 % Normal bone marrow organ function define : Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x IULN AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 3.0 x IULN Creatinine ≤ IULN OR creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level institutional normal Systemic corticosteroid therapy permit provided dosing great 4 mg per day ( dexamethasone equivalent ) day vaccine administration Bevacizumab allow give symptomatic control vasogenic edema avoid high dose corticosteroid Women childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control , abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , must inform treat physician immediately . Ability understand willingness sign IRB approve write informed consent document ( legally authorize representative , applicable ) . As safety feasibility study , prior immunotherapy permit . However , prior immunotherapy must discontinue least 2 week peptide vaccine administration . Nonimmunologic therapy may continue . Inadequate tissue acquisition allow neoantigen screen No candidate neoantigen identify screen A history malignancy ≤ 3 year previous exception nonmelanoma skin cancer , situ cancer successfully resect cure , treat superficial bladder cancer , earlystage solid tumor successfully resect without need adjuvant radiation chemotherapy . Currently receive investigational agent . Known allergy , history serious adverse reaction , vaccine anaphylaxis , hive , respiratory difficulty . A history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition polyICLC agent use study . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . History preexist immunodeficiency disorder include chronic infection ( i.e . hepatitis B , hepatitis C , HIV ) , autoimmune condition require immunosuppressive therapy . This include inflammatory bowel disease , ulcerative colitis , Crohn 's disease , systemic vasculitis , scleroderma , psoriasis , multiple sclerosis , hemolytic anemia , immunemediated thrombocytopenia , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus , Sjogren 's syndrome , sarcoidosis , rheumatologic disease medical condition use medication might make difficult patient complete full course treatment generate immune response vaccine . Presence clinically significant increase intracranial pressure ( e.g . impend herniation ) hemorrhage , uncontrolled seizure , requirement immediate palliative treatment . Pregnant and/or breastfeeding . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test within 7 day first dose vaccine .</criteria>
