	<brief_summary>Type 2 diabetes major public health problem increase prevalence morbidity mortality accompanies . Therapeutic management pathology , lifestyle measure , dietary physical activity fundamental . Their observance unfortunately often insufficient , leading therapeutic climb first oral antidiabetic ( OAD ) use insulin therapy . Yet ample evidence physical activity improve glucose control patient particular improve insulin sensitivity training period also single session physical activity . Neuro-myo-electrical stimulation ( NMES ) use common clinical practice physical therapy , patient neurological orthopedic surgery particular . In fact , method enables improvement volume strength , even denervated muscle . Recent study also show benefit NMES situation cardiac respiratory readjustment . In addition , NMES use top athlete supplement classical training order develop muscle strength speed recovery . Investigators propose test impact bilateral quadriceps NMES insulin sensitivity type 2 diabetic patient treat OAD ( exclude glitazone ) . To , investigator plan assess insulin sensitivity reference method hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp surgery , single session bilateral quadriceps NMES sequence daily train 6 day quadriceps NMES bilateral . Investigators hope show improvement insulin sensitivity method , would constitute alternative physical activity treatment diabetes type 2 . This procedure would particularly interesting diabetic subject type 2 counter- indication inability perform conventional physical activity .</brief_summary>
