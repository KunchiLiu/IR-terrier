	<brief_title>Effect Endoscopic Papillary Balloon Dilation ERCP Complications</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Common bile duct ( CBD ) stone common disease high morbidity . Half century ago , surgery bile duct exploration T-tube drainage radical treatment stone revolutionary technique report 1970 , possible remove stone mean endoscopic sphincterotomy ( EST ) endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ( ERCP ) . Since , EST become promising measure patient doctor meet purpose minimally invasive treatment . However , EST remain advanced technique require high skill endoscopist . As far patient anatomical biliary abnormality , papillary diverticulum , likely end severe complication bleed perforation EST procedure . On hand , EST may also lead permanent dysfunction Oddi 's sphincter . It currently report grow number young patient , even child manage EST still debate due existence long-term complication . Endoscopic papillary balloon dilatation ( EPBD ) alternative technique develop achieve purpose EST preserve Oddi 's sphincter ' function partially , , EPBD easy grasp endoscopist . By use columnar balloon , Oddi 's sphincter expand without direct transection , temporary relaxation Oddi 's sphincter make possible remove stone rest procedure well . Removing common bile duct stone EPBD firstly report 1982 prove safe efficient . However , clinical observation find simple EPBD high incidence develop acute pancreatitis ERCP , especially patient intact papilla . The speculated reason high post-ERCP pancreatitis ( PEP ) rate might pancreatic duct orifice edema result inadequate destroy Oddi 's sphincter balloon dilatation , lead pancreatic duct obstruct high ductal pressure afterward . Retrospective study indicate PEP rate post-EPBD 10 % consider slightly high ordinary EST new modify method introduce small EST prior EPBD . Currently small EST plus EPBD increasingly use clinical proven effective treatment improve success rate common bile duct stone removal , preserve Oddi 's sphincter function lower long-term complication . Dedicate practitioner conduct many kind study reduce post-ERCP complication , nowadays , focus dilation time EPBD would suspect key point issue . Nonetheless , institute willing join EPBD research universal concern post-ERCP complication increase , common agreement achieve present . From prospect data , might see confused result . Slowly inject balloon contrast agent keep dilate 1-2 minute , 15 second image papilla balloon waist disappear able get stone removal rate regular procedure , slow balloon fill performance helpful protect Oddi 's sphincter function reduce post-ERCP complication . However , study conclude difference matter stone removal rate post-ERCP pancreatitis instead blood amylase , arm 20 second compare 60 second 30 second compare 60 second . Interestingly , another inspire randomize control trial ( RCT ) study prolong dilation time 5 minute . The author figure PEP rate five minute group small 1-minute group well stone removal . Few study concern optimal duration time EPBD important patient ' safety maximum utilization easy handle EPBD procedure compare EST . Therefore large volume multicenter prospective randomize control study target different EPBD duration management affect complication ERCP attempt discover promise method safe therapy common bile duct stone .</detailed_description>
