	<detailed_description>This study seek enroll woman breast cancer undergo neoadjuvant chemotherapy evaluate efficacy investigational imaging technology know Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy Imaging ( DOSI ) predict patient response chemotherapy treatment . DOSI noninvasive imaging method use harmless near-infrared light use simple handheld probe hold skin predict tumor metabolic activity . It use nonionizing radiation , require external contrast agent use low light exposure human tissue . DOSI scan perform frequently bedside setting doctor 's office infusion center . DOSI already show promise monitoring breast cancer patient undergo preoperative chemotherapy . Several group demonstrate optical change predictive response course week month treatment . The investigator group begin show DOSI measurement drug infusion early time-points ( first 24 hour ) correlate tumor final pathological response . While data provocative , significantly work need confirm early time-points predictive different treatment group tumor molecular subtypes . In study , breast cancer patient receive DOSI scan subset follow time-points : baseline , drug infusion , early therapy , mid-therapy post-therapy . DOSI result compare standard care pathology result determine surgery . Additionally , investigator correlate DOSI parameter additional biopsy specimens take treatment ( typically patient adaptive treatment trial ) . Each DOSI scan take 3045minutes/ session , although infusion measurement take long . DOSI potentially help doctor gain information necessary make evidence-based change treatment strategy individual patient . The investigator long-term goal provide oncologists relatively simple , risk-free bedside tool help predict response early , thereby maximize therapeutic response minimize unnecessary toxicity .</detailed_description>
