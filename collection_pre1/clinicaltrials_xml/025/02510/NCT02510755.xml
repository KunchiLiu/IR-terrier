	<brief_summary>A broad group disorder associate severe stress existence child adolescent . The characteristic result , one serious state post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , whose main source consist physical sexual violence , less extent , accidents public road natural disaster , whose child subject witness . PTSD associate deleterious effect cognition include mnemonic operation . The painful reminder traumatic event one disabling symptom . However , many memory disorder experimental study gradually update . They maintain close link emotional regulation disturb know PTSD . However majority study emotion cognition relationship brain activity take adult subject . Work adolescent morphological study , rare neurobehavioral reduce two study functional neuroimaging . Contrary observe adult , morphological study report consistently , reduction hippocampal volume . There study idle state . Two study functional MRI , first highlight PTSD patient inhibition activity anterior cingulate cortex ( ACC ) stimuli evoke trauma , second report increased activity prefrontal cortex Median ( mPFC ) inhibition . The objective task study evaluate impact psychological trauma brain structure involve emotional component memory ( amygdala , hippocampus , prefrontal cortex particular ) . For , investigator take 33 adolescent , include patient posttraumatic symptomatology match control free trauma age , several neuroimaging exam , anatomical functional . The functional review include rest another activation episodic memory task design assess influence self-perception memory impairment observe patient . The investigator check , group patient control , involvement cortical structure relation regulation emotional memory ( CCA , amygdala hippocampus ) . The anatomy hippocampus benefit specific image method develop unit INSERM U923 . Endocrine correlate stress test study fully-traumatic salivary cortisol sample . This research clarify mechanism involve emotional memory impairment secondary psychological trauma , relationship self ( judgment self-esteem ) study morphological substrate . A longer-term goal offer help diagnosis monitoring young patient posttraumatic symptomatology .</brief_summary>
