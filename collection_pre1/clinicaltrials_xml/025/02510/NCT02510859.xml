It recognize country `` North '' , 30 60 % hospitalized patient suffer dénutrition . In case , cover imbalance contribution need ; two main mechanism delivery failure ( fasting , ingest difficulty ... ) / increase requirement ( hypermetabolism ... ) . In cancer patient Aero-Digestive Upper Airways ( VADS ) , imbalance even pronounce two mechanism exist potentiate . Patients include study population risk , therapeutic contain least radiotherapy . It recognize form therapy expose dental complication , mucous , saliva . These complication deleterious effect nutritional status patient . The diagnosis , treatment prevention dénutritions important place therapeutic strategy type cancer event whose incidence morbid consequence high appropriate nutritional treatment cas . While complete correction malnutrition generally pass effective etiological treatment causal pathology , therapeutic efficacy latter often condition nutritionnel state . In addition concept , investigator want study benefit diet follow irradiation phase patient head neck cancer New treaty . We propose randomize , phase III , open , multicenter , evaluate impact dietary consultation home life quality patient head neck cancer include first therapeutic sequence involve radiotherapy less aware . The duration study 24 month . The main objective evaluate impact dietary consultation home life quality patient head neck cancer include first therapeutic sequence involve less sensitized radiotherapy .</brief_summary>
