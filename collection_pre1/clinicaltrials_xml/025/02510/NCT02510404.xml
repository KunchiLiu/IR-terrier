	<brief_summary>PIDD represent expand group genetic disorder compromise immunity bacteria , virus , fungi . The severe form PIDD cause profound susceptibility opportunistic infection due impaired absent T-cell immunity . These disease rapidly fatal unless treat via hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) . Chronic viral illness common present feature many disorder , study show survival HSCT profoundly impact patient 's pre-transplant disease status . Primary infection virus cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV ) common , respiratory virus adenovirus also frequently cause infection . In patient severe combine immunodeficiency ( SCID ) , prior study identified virus common cause mortality immediate period follow HSCT . Though form PIDD amenable HSCT without require condition chemotherapy , many form require variable degree pre-conditioning ensure stable engraftment donor cell achieve . The administration cytotoxic chemotherapy use conditioning regimens however increase risk regimen related toxicity patient ( especially active viral infection ) risk particularly high , leading high treatment related mortality rate . For reason , many patient even consider candidate HSCT delay get HSCT ultimately succumb infection receive transplant . The primary objective study determine safety administer third-party multivirus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes ( mCTL ) adult CMV seropositive donor treat refractory viral infection patient primary immunodeficiency disorder ( PIDD ) prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation ( HSCT ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Since recovery virus-specific T cell clearly associate protection infection virus , adoptive immunotherapy decrease time immune reconstitution attractive approach . Virus-specific T cell generate repeated stimulation antigen present cell ( APCs ) express viral antigen evaluate clinical trial prevent treat viral infection immunocompromised host . This approach eliminate alloreactive T cell . To broaden specificity single CTL line include three common viral pathogen stem cell recipient , investigator reactivate CMV adenovirus-specific T cell use mononuclear cell transduce recombinant adenoviral vector encode CMV antigen pp65 ( Ad5f35CMVpp65 ) . Subsequent stimulation EBV-LCL transduce vector reactivate EBV-specific T cell maintain expansion activate adenovirus CMV-specific T cell . This method reliably produce CTLs cytotoxic function specific three virus , investigator infuse 14 stem cell recipient Phase I prophylaxis study . They observe recovery immunity CMV EBV patient increase adenovirus-specific T cell see patient evidence adenovirus infection pre-infusion . A follow-up study frequency adenovirus-specific T cell increase infused CTLs produce similar result , thus highlight importance endogenous antigen promote expansion infuse T cell vivo . Nevertheless , patient clinical trial pre-infusion CMV , adenovirus EBV infection reactivation able clear infection , include one patient severe adenoviral pneumonia require ventilatory support . CTLs recognize multiple antigen therefore produce clinically relevant effect three virus .</detailed_description>
