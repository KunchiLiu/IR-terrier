	<brief_summary>If eligible participate research study complete physical screening procedure , participant ask return Substrate Metabolism Laboratory another occasion short fast ( food beverage - besides water ) least 6 hour . After participant arrive , participant rest quietly approximately 30 min . The investigator collect blood sample vein participant hand , forearm . After obtain baseline blood sample , participant exercise moderate intensity ( treadmill stationary bike ) one hour . This one hour moderate exercise session feel like slow jog participant would able carry conversation . In order investigator measure energy expend amount fat participant burn exercise , investigator periodically ask participant breathe mouthpiece investigator collect participant expire breath . After exercise session investigator collect another blood sample vein participant hand , forearm .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>General study design - Subjects exercise regularly instruct exercise exactly 3 day experimental trial , abstain exercise training program experiment complete . - Subjects arrive Substrate Metabolism Laboratory ( 1210 CCRB ) least 6h fast . - After rest quietly laboratory approximately 30min , Dr. Horowitz collect rest blood sample venipuncture , do IRB approve protocol ( e.g. , HUM00029179 ) . Briefly , Dr. Horowitz wash hand put glove . The participant 's skin disinfect venipuncture site isopropyl alcohol . Single-use needle use participant immediately discard biohazard sharp container use . After blood draw , direct pressure apply site needle insertion avoid/reduce bruise discomfort . - Subjects exercise ( bike treadmill ) 1h moderate exercise intensity ( approximately 65 % predict VO2peak ) . This moderate exercise intensity use extensively Dr. Horowitz 's laboratory previous exercise test training study lean obese individual , well tolerated population . - During exercise session , subject wear heart rate monitor ensure participant exercise correct exercise intensity . - Subjects also use mouthpiece nose clip ( describe ) ~5min beginning , middle , end exercise verify exercise approximately 65 % predict VO2peak . - A study team member present participant time exercise ensure comfort safety . - Immediately exercise another blood sample collect .</detailed_description>
