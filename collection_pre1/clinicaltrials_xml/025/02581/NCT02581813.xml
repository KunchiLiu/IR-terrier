	<brief_title>Does Dairy Benefit Bone &amp; Body Composition Overweight Girls Undergoing Weight Management Program ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Three group ( 25 girls/group ) participate study . Participants must low dairy consumer ( 0-1 svgs/d ) little structured physical activity study entry . Each participant assign group ; one two experimental group control group . The two intervention group differ amount dairy consume ( 4 svgs vs. 0-1 svg/d ) . Both undergo exercise program ( 3x/wk ) counsel healthy eating train nutritionist-dietitian every month . The control group test begin end study help account growth-related change study receive formal intervention . In group , investigator assess body composition ( muscle mass , fat mass , % body fat regional fat mass ) bone ( bone turnover marker ) . The investigator also measure various metabolic inflammatory marker , hormone well dietary intake , strength fitness . This study 2 phase . Phase 1 ( 12 week intervention ) determine whether increase intake dairy product improve bone body composition 12-week weight management intervention . The investigator expect two group participate intervention show significant change body weight body composition great gain strength fitness compare control group . The investigator expect consume dairy show great improvement body composition bone health compare consuming add dairy . The investigator also anticipate good vitamin D status , less whole-body inflammation well balance hormone directly affect bone calcium use consume dairy . Both intervention group show improvement fast insulin , glucose cholesterol . In Phase 2 ( acute exercise bout ) investigator examine whether 12-week weight management intervention , without dairy , affect bone turnover response single bout bone stimulating exercise . The participant perform two session jump exercise previously show stimulate bone formation improve bone strength . One session perform start 12 week intervention , end . The investigator expect girl consume dairy 12 week show pronounced bone response , characterize great bone formation less resorption 24 h exercise . The investigator also expect complete 12-week diet exercise program ( regardless dairy intake ) show quicker return normal exercise-induced inflammation show benefit bone compare control group .</detailed_description>
