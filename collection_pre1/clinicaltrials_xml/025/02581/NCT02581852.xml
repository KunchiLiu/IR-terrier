	<brief_title>Workability Patients With Seropositive Rheumatoid Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic disease like RA negatively associate workability RA show economic burden society patient . RA patient seem also prone frailty characterize slow walk speed , low physical activity , low grip strength . Also poor sleep show negatively influence work ability majority patient RA experience insomnia , general fatigue mental fatigue . RA also show affect sexual functioning . This monocentric cross sectional study conduct Viennese rheumatological outpatient clinic day hospital 100 seropositive RA patient . The primary objective study compare workability subject seropositive RA work age high low disease activity . Secondary interest clarify influence frailty , functional ability muscle strength workability determine effect disease activity select physiological need ( sleep quality , sexual functioning ) . Disease activity assess patient 's routine visit clinic via clinical disease activity index ( CDAI ) . Workability determine Work Ability Index questionnaire . The influencing determinant frailty functional disability also assess via questionnaire and/or physical examination ( Survey Health , Ageing Retirement Europe Frailty instrument , Short Physical Performance Battery , Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index ) . For muscle strength assessment hand grip maximum quadriceps strength measure . Contributing physiologic need quality sleep sexual functioning additionally determine vial self report questionnaire ( Medical Outcome Study -Sleep Scale , Index sexual function ) . In order compare patient low high disease activity regard metric data ( like sleep quality sexual functioning ) unpaired Students t-tests ( give normal distribute data homogeneous variance ) , Welch correct unpaired Student t-tests ( case normal distribute data heterogenous variance ) Mann-Whitney-U test ( case skew data ) use . Kolmogorov-Smirnov Levene test use test normal distribution homogenous variances.To assess impact frailty , functional ability , muscle strength workability ( high versus low ) binary logistic regression apply . In general alpha level set 5 % .</detailed_description>
