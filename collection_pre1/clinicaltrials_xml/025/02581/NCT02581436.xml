	<detailed_description>I . Background Kidney transplantation treatment choice patient end stage renal disease need function replacement therapy , absolute contraindication procedure . The current figure report USA post-transplant graft survival one year , 95 % case live donor ( LD ) recipients 90 % decease donor ( DD ) recipients3 ; mean calculate survival graft increase currently 14 year LD 11 year DD recipient . The fact graft survival hinge multiple immune non-immune factor well recognize ; however , main cause graft loss solidly link rejection , evidence involvement immune humoral response case ( specific antibody HLA antigen ) . The main cause acute graft dysfunction acute rejection ( AR ) . Several study associate episode entity chronic structural injury subsequent functional impairment . Thus , timely diagnostic certainty pivotal optimize immunosuppressive therapy preserve graft function . To date , tool available confirm AR graft biopsy establish histological diagnostic criteria8 . However , diagnostic tool limitation result mainly sample error cost . Furthermore , 10 % patient normal graft function evidence AR protocol biopsy , center use follow-up modality kidney transplant recipient ( KTR ) unable document immune phenomenon . Ideally , AR non-invasive , diagnostic tool would utmost use KTR follow-up since would preclude need graft biopsy efficiently support management immune suppressor . Therefore , systematic performance highly specific sensitive assay reflect AR , would allow timely detection immune phenomenon compare current standard ( biopsy ) . Moreover , systematic use tool characteristic would allow stratification immunological risk well proactive adjustment immunosuppressor drug dosage , potentially limit chronic injury improve graft 's survival . The background propose study base extensive line research conduct Dr. Sarwal et al . They recently publish results10 monitor pediatric kidney transplant recipient . Biomarkers gene panel peripheral blood detect microarray discover single institution subsequently validate quantitative-PCR 12 pediatric kidney transplant program . A total 367 individual blood sample , pair graft biopsy blind centralized classification , analyze ( 115 acute rejection , 180 stable kidney graft function , 72 cause graft injury ) . Among gene differentially express microarrays , quantitative-PCR analysis set 5 gene ( DUSP1 , PBEF1 , PSEN1 , MAPK9 NLTR ) classify acute rejection great precision . The 5 gene model sensitivity 91 % , specificity 94 % , positive predictive value 83 % , negative predictive value 97 % 92 % precision differentiate acute rejection sample phenotype ( stable acute rejection , acute rejection/ non-stable ) . Interestingly , 8/12 sample patient borderline rejection biopsy , classify acute rejection 5 gene model . The frequent prediction phenotype borderline rejection biopsy suggest pre-clinical injury acute rejection could also identify quantitative-PCR peripheral blood sample , thus allow earlier treatment patients.10 The fact model predict acute rejection cellular humoral immune injury modality , utmost relevance . Moreover , gene peripheral blood , strongly link graft rejection , correlate ( independent ) many demographic , clinical , treatment modality bacterial/viral infection parameter . The 5 gene center leukocyte trafficking T/B cell activation mostly express monocyte , activate peripheral circulation ; reflect injury response mechanism cellular oxidative stress ( DUSP1 ) , apoptosis ( MAPK9 ) , IL2-dependent cytolytic gene activation ( NKTR ) , increase cell adhesion via e-cadherin/catenin complex ( PSEN1 ) smooth muscle vascular cell injury ( PBEF1 ) . The author point study conduct pediatric young adult population , rejection may aggressive due disparity adult transplant organ pediatric recipient , result poor treatment adherence adolescent recipient , lead strong immune response . Thus , 5-gene model would require evaluation order determine diagnostic potential acute rejection patient age , large patient cohort association different immunosuppressant regime . For reason , group investigator undertake large study identify transcription profile would unify kidney transplant recipient population independently age , cause terminal renal disease , comorbidities , type immune suppression use different center USA , Mexico Europe . The final selection 17 gene include 10 gene pediatric population 7 newly identify gene allow molecular classification acute rejection adult pediatric patient . They correctly predict presence acute rejection non-acute rejection different sample collect patient various participate study site , recipient different age previous data normalization . On basis observation , score generate use 14 17 gene , Pearson 's correlation test , score attribute detect gene compare genetic profile find patient without rejection , assign number +1 -1 . The score range -13 +13 . Among patient score predict `` high risk rejection '' ( Acute Rejection Risk-Score ≥ 7 ) , 90.24 % correctly classify acute rejection , test predict `` low risk acute rejection '' ( Acute Rejection Risk-Score ≤ -7 ) , 97.7 % correctly classify non-acute rejection basis biopsy finding . Furthermore , average predictive probability acute rejection highly significant compare acute rejection vs. non-acute rejection 4 center ( p &lt; 0.0001 ; p=0.002 ; p &lt; 0.0001 ; p &lt; 00001 ) , respectively . This model equally detect acute rejection mediate antibody well cell-mediated , high predictive probability . The prediction acute rejection independent post-transplant period duration . These 17 gene include KSORT assay ( Kidney Solid Organ Rejection Test ) algorithm generate risk score know kSORT analysis suit ( kSAS ) . In recently publish study data Institute , result biopsy obtain post-transplant dysfunction review January 2007 December 2011 ( n=223 ) , observe AR incidence first year post-transplant 11.8 % live donor KTR 17.4 % decease donor graft recipient . Throughout 2013 , number kidney transplant perform Institute increase 63 ( 53 % living donor , 46 % deceased donor ) . In accordance institutional protocol follow-up kidney transplant recipient , currently obtain protocol graft biopsies 3rd 12th month post-transplant . The protocol biopsy obtain establish timepoints purpose document whether evidence immunological activity ( sub-clinical ) sign pathology would require modification immunosuppressive therapeutic regime . We also obtain graft biopsy point post-transplant period abnormality renal function develop , define verified increase serum creatinine ≥ 25 % previous baseline value , absence evident pathology obstructive process urinary tract , urinary tract infection , dehydration , supra-therapeutic blood level use calcineurin inhibitor . As May 2013 , date 3rd month protocol biopsy establish , document incidence sub-clinical acute rejection , include borderline major rejection accord Banff classification , 52 % ( 10/40 biopsy reveal acute cellular humoral rejection 11/40 borderline injury ) . This number unprecedented Institute protocol biopsy previously obtain 3rd month . Currently , KTR Institute receive induction therapy modality ( Thymoglobulin Basiliximab ) , depend individual immunological risk origin graft . Hence , live donor KT recipient PRA &lt; 30 % HLA donor specific antibody ( DSA ) treat Basiliximab ( anti-IL2R monoclonal antibody ; 2 dos 20mg ) ; exception KTR share 2 haplotype donor receive induction therapy . All decease donor graft recipient ( independently PRA % ) , live donor KTR positive donor-specific HLA antibody ( independently PRA % ) PRA ≥30 % , induce Thymoglobulin ( rabbit polyclonal antibody preparation , total dose 4.5mg/Kg ) . All patient must lymphocyte crossmatch test ( T/B ) , negative CDC-AHG DSA ( Single antigen , Luminex ) also require negative crossmatch flow cytometry . Biopsy-proven acute rejection event treat pulse methylprednisolone 3 consecutive day . Patients steroid-resistant acute cellular rejection ( biopsy-proven ) , administer Thymoglobulin ( 1.5 mg/Kg/body weight , 7 day ) . Patients antibody-mediated acute rejection ( humoral rejection ) treat 3-5 plasmapheresis ( PP ) session , 100 mg IV Ig per Kg body weight PP session rituximab ( anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody ) end PP session . The standard initial maintenance immunosuppressive regime Tacrolimus , Mofetil Mycophenolate prednisone . The initial Tacrolimus dos aim obtain blood trough level 10 15 ng/mL , 3rd month post-transplant ; subsequently absence AR first trimester ( clinical protocol biopsy ) , trough level maintain 8 10 ng/mL throughout first year post-transplant . The maintenance dose prednisone 5 mg daily Mofetil Mycophenolate 1-1.5 g daily . II . Justification In previous paragraph , describe KSORT test 's high sensitivity specificity detection acute rejection . It necessary attempt transfer clinical set help support treatment decision , increase immune suppression base positive test result . The impact maneuver efficacy safety outcomes pivotal order incorporate scrutinize method daily clinical practice . Our Institute transplant 60 patient last year , conduct study center feasible . III . Hypothesis aim Hypothesis Adding kSORT genetic panel post-transplant follow-up decrease incidence severity acute rejection well chronicity index yearly protocol biopsy , improve calculate glomerular filtration rate follow-up two year . Aims : To evaluate safety efficacy add kSORT test surveillance patient kidney transplantation .</detailed_description>
