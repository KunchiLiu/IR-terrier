	<brief_summary>This doble-blind , mask , compare placebo clinical trial pediatric population contact tuberculosis without tuberculosis infection . This trial aim study effect probiotic Nyaditum resae® level specific Treg memory cell eight week first administration , global tolerability treatment . Nyaditum resae® preparation form capsule contain heat-killed environmental mycobacteria Mycobacterium manresensis . The overall objective study effect Nyaditum resae® immunity , could reduce risk develop active tuberculosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Evaluate Tolerability Immunogenicity Nyaditum Resae ® Probiotic Administered Pediatric Population Contact With Tuberculosis With Without Latent Tuberculosis Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence tuberculosis still problem first magnitude . Every year 1.5 million people die ; 10 million case illness 100 million new infect . The grow problem multi-resistance add , remain prevalent : 700,000 patient , figure increase annually 100,000 people . Prevention tuberculosis currently difficult disease cause bacillus ( Mycobacterium tuberculosis ) transmit air : No risk factor become infect identify still prophylactic vaccine prevents infection . One characteristic aspect tuberculosis majority ( 90-95 % ) people without immunity alteration develop disease infect . As people develop disease , still know develop . A group researcher Institut Germans Trias Pujol recently discover mechanism explains trend . In short , happen certain people create strong inflammatory response tuberculosis bacillus , end create massive destruction tissue around bacillus brings characteristic lesion tuberculosis : tuberculous cavity . This group researcher devise way `` reeducate '' immune system bacillus make aggressive . And use two instrument . The first one , environmental mycobacteria , namely bacillus family mycobacteria tuberculosis , usually live water drink , great less extent already intestinal flora . The second , induce tolerant response , like eat food . To induce tolerant response , low repeat dos product make immune system digestive duct `` use '' presence . Thus , become find product , immune system reacts light balance manner , avoid excessive inflammatory response . The clear example fact immune system `` use '' feed proteins generates rejection answer find intestinal mucosa . Hence come probiotic Nyaditum resae® , preparation form capsule , contain heat-killed Mycobacterium manresensis thus generate cross-immunity tuberculosis bacillus . By give low repeat dose generate tolerant response , happen infection Mycobacterium tuberculosis , balance immune response trigger able reduce risk develop active tuberculosis . Tolerability Nyaditum resae® study adult . Next step asses behavior pediatric population , since particularly vulnerable population country high incidence disease .</detailed_description>
