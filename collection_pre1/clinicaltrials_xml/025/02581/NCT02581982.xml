	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well paclitaxel pembrolizumab work treat patient urothelial cancer respond previous treatment spread place body . Drugs use chemotherapy , paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Giving paclitaxel together pembrolizumab may effective treatment urothelial cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Paclitaxel Pembrolizumab Treating Patients With Refractory Metastatic Urothelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate overall response rate ( ORR ) pembrolizumab combine paclitaxel . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability pembrolizumab combine paclitaxel . II . To calculate progression-free survival ( PFS ) rate 6 month . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine immune effect pembrolizumab combine paclitaxel . II . To associate immune effect tumor response . III . To explore change immune-regulatory micro ribonucleic acid ( RNAs ) biomarkers response . OUTLINE : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 paclitaxel IV 60 minute day 1 8 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow within 30 day every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
