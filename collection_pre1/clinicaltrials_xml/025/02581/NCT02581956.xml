	<brief_summary>Breast cancer lead cancer woman worldwide . The incidence breast cancer increase probably due prolonged life expectancy variety environmental factor . Fortunately , breast cancer outcome survival improve due early detection new treatment modality . After make first stride breast cancer , i.e . undergoing ablation surgery , breast cancer survivor still go series chemotherapy , could prolong survival almost inevitably downgrade quality life due grueling side effect , lack energy vulnerability infection . Numerous medical intervention try healthcare provider alleviate side effect , expensive therefore become another burden cancer-afflicted patient . Previous study already indicate exercise generate long-term benefit breast cancer survivor , include improved physical function , elevate maximal oxygen intake , decrease lethargic symptom , increase immune function quality life . Among variety exercise , walk least costly , easy-to-follow type . Through simple , predesigned walk regimen , investigator expect breast cancer patient undergo chemotherapy could cost-effectively reap benefit either physically psychologically . Cluster differentiation 3 ( CD3+ ) , present stage T-cell development , useful maker identify T-cells . ( Cluster differentiation 4 ) CD4+ T cell , also know T helper cell , play assistant role immunologic process , maturation B cell , activation macrophage cytotoxic T cell . Cluster differentiation 8 ( CD8+ ) T cell , know cytotoxic T cell , responsible destroy virus-infected cell tumor cell . Generally , count CD3+ T cell , CD4+ T cell CD8+ T cell could reflection immune system health . Short-Form 36 ( SF-36 ) , patient-reported survey , widely adopt tool evaluate patient 's individual health status . By mean serial blood sample collection delivery SF-36 survey , study aim objectively quantitatively evaluate effect aerobic walk breast cancer patient undergo chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
