	<brief_summary>This randomize pilot phase II trial study effect pembrolizumab without carboplatin paclitaxel immune response patient non-small cell lung cancer come back stage IIIB-IV . Monoclonal antibody , pembrolizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Drugs use chemotherapy , carboplatin paclitaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving pembrolizumab together carboplatin paclitaxel may improve immune response patient non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Pembrolizumab With Without Carboplatin Paclitaxel Immune Response Patients With Recurrent Stage IIIB-IV Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine immune effect single agent pembrolizumab pembrolizumab combine low-dose carboplatin paclitaxel . II . Estimate treatment response single agent pembrolizumab pembrolizumab combine low-dose carboplatin paclitaxel . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine toxicity tolerability pembrolizumab pembrolizumab combine low-dose carboplatin paclitaxel . II . Assess quality life ( QOL ) patient receive single agent pembrolizumab pembrolizumab combine carboplatin paclitaxel . III . Assess association immune response clinical response . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 . ARM II : Patients receive pembrolizumab IV 30 minute day 1 , paclitaxel IV 1 hour carboplatin IV 1 hour day 1 , 7 14 . In arm , course repeat every 3 week 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow least 30 day every 8 week thereafter .</detailed_description>
