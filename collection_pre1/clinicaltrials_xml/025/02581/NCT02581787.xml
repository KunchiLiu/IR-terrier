	<brief_summary>The SABR-ATAC trial ( Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy anti-TGFB Antibody Combination ) phase I/II trial study side effect efficacy fresolimumab , anti-transforming growth factor beta ( TGFB ) antibody , give stereotactic ablative radiotherapy patient stage IA-IB non-small cell lung cancer . Fresolimumab may inhibit radiation side effect block tumor growth multiple mechanism . Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy ( SABR ) , also know stereotactic body radiotherapy ( SBRT ) , specialized form radiation therapy precisely deliver high dose radiation directly tumor , thus kill tumor cell minimize damage normal tissue . Giving fresolimumab SABR may work well treat patient early stage non-small cell lung cancer treat SABR alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate safe dose fresolimumab combination stereotactic ablative radiotherapy ( SABR ) patient . ( Phase I ) II . Evaluate rate radiation induce pulmonary fibrosis SABR plus fresolimumab . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Evaluate potential adverse event patient receive fresolimumab plus SABR . ( Phase I ) II . Evaluate post treatment change pulmonary function . ( Phase I ) III . Evaluate recurrence rate progression free survival . ( Phase I ) IV . Assess pharmacokinetics ( PK ) fresolimumab combination SABR ( optional patient ) . ( Phase I ) V. Evaluate rate severity radiation induce pulmonary fibrosis SABR plus fresolimumab . ( Phase I ) VI . Evaluate severity radiation induce pulmonary fibrosis SABR plus fresolimumab . ( Phase II ) VII . Evaluate potential adverse event patient receive fresolimumab plus SABR . ( Phase II ) VIII . Evaluate post treatment change pulmonary function . ( Phase II ) IX . Evaluate recurrence rate progression free survival . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose escalation study fresolimumab follow phase II study . Patients receive fresolimumab intravenously ( IV ) day 1 , 15 , 36 undergo SABR 4 fraction day 8 12 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 3 , 6 , 12 month .</detailed_description>
