	<brief_summary>This study aim determine elevate wound-edge endothelial miR-200b barrier wound heal diabetic patient also determine ex vivo supplementation miR-21 mimic recombinant MFG-E8 resolve inflammation wound macrophage isolate NPWT sponge diabetic wound . This study enroll 124 ( 60 miR-200b arm 64 miR21 arm ) Diabetic Wound patient wind tissue oxygenation adequate support wind heal study 14 week include 4 study visit .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study design 14 week prospective observational study patient diabetic wound visit Ohio State University Comprehensive Wound Center ( CWC ) enrol . Patients enrol follow 14 week include 4 study visit , initial visit ( week 0 ) , study visit 2 ( week 2 ) , study visit 3 ( week 4 ) return final follow-up study visit 4 ( week 14 ) . Standardized Care Outline per physician discretion . The initial visit take place patient regularly schedule CWC visit follow take place : Informed consent obtain , Baseline demographic , medical history , current lab medication record , Wound data record , Ankle brachial index complete patient leg wound already complete per Standard Care ( SoC ) since onset wound , Wound photograph digital planimetry measure wound area , Wound fluid collect ( mir200b arm ) : Fluid collect filter paper method aspiration method . Wound fluid collection take place debridement biopsies.The NPWT sponge collect ( mir200b miR-21 arm ) : Wound macrophage , immune cell ( miR-21 ) endothelial cell ( miR-200b ) isolate wound cell obtain sponge dress NWPT . The NWPT delivers negative pressure help promote wound heal . NWPT routinely apply chronic wound therapeutic modality . The foam dress collect discarded biological waste regular CWC visit . Two 3 mm punch tissue biopsy obtain patient 's physician . One biopsy use LCM ( wound-edge endothelial cell capture ) immunohistochemistry study biopsy use determine wound infect use quantitative bacterial culture scan electron microscopy biofilm structure detection . Patient return study visit 2 follow happen : Patient data collect include : medication review , adverse event review wound data record , Wound photograph digital planimetry measure wound area , Wound fluid ( miR-200b arm ) collect , NPWT collect ( miR-200b miR-21 arm ) two 3 mm punch tissue biopsy obtain patient 's physician . Note- These biopsy optional . At begin enrollment patient ask would like biopsy obtain . The research personnel make note patient ' decision . If wound show sign heal show sign infection ( i.e . wound stall heal 2 week become large size ) wound declare healed physician , biopsy obtain . Patients return study visit 3 . The follow take place : Patient data collect include : medication review , adverse event review , wound measurement , etiology , location duration record , Wound photograph digital planimetry measure wound area , Wound fluid collect ( miR-200b arm ) , NPWT collect ( miR-200b miR-21 arm ) , Two 3 mm punch tissue biopsy obtain patient 's physician . Note- subject wound declare healed physician , biopsy obtain . Patients return study visit 4 follow take place : Medical Chart review determine final status wound heal , heal heal , Wound data record , Adverse Event review , Wound photograph digital planimetry measure wound area . The risk associate research study low . There therapeutic intervention medication part study administer depend amount sensation subject site wound . The wound site numb apply local anesthesia appropriate area biopsied . There may discomfort tissue biopsy procedure . The wound site numb apply local anesthesia appropriate area biopsied . The amount pain occur wound biopsy vary person person , reasonable effort make minimize pain . The biopsy procedure do within boundary exist wound avoid give patient separate new wound . Bleeding possible complication , risk low small biopsy reduce use local anesthetic epinephrine , silver nitrate stick available room cauterize biopsy site need . Infection also potential risk ; however , wound tissue biopsy routinely perform standard care CWC diagnose wound infection . The biopsy site appropriately monitor infection physician manage wound routine wound clinic visit . The ABI test may result temporary discomfort around ankle foot cuff inflate , present physical medical risk . The wound fluid collection non-invasive present risk . Study participant benefit directly participation study . This research information potential providing considerable benefit wound care identify key player influence closure chronic diabetic wound . Such knowledge help develop novel biomarker miR-directed therapeutic strategy .</detailed_description>
