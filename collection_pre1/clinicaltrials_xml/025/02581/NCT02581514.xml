	<detailed_description>Eosinophilia , define blood eosinophil granulocyte rate great 500 / mm3 , frequently encounter internal medicine . Its cause vary : atopy , drug allergy , parasitic infection , autoimmune disease solid neoplasias . Over 200 etiology report , difficult diagnose life-threatening Eosinophilia diagnostic dilemma , etiology extensive vary . The aim study assess feasibility diagnostic approach base decision algorithm group patient eosinophilia . The contribution diagnosis hierarchical strategy prescribe additional test , base clinical examination well simple diagnostic test , never evaluate We assume procedure hierarchy additional test would increase frequency diagnosed case decrease time diagnosis . This procedure define algorithm would even reduce number test necessary reach diagnosis . All type patient tack account : come university hospital , refer general practitioner hospital . In addition address internal medicine patient , also Hematology Infectious Diseases . A comparison various group would relevant , since disorder may different . Once enrolled , patient drive investigator various step exam impose algorithm . Indeed , 5 month ( Day1 5 , 43 , 71 , 85 , 99 ,113 month 5 ) , patient ask comply various exam assessment impose algorithm lead diagnosis</detailed_description>
