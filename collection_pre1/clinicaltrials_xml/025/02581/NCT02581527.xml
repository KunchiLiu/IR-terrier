	<brief_title>A Randomised Trial Evaluate Toxicity Efficacy 1200mg 1800mg Rifampicin Daily 4 Months Pulmonary Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type design An open-label 3-arm trial compare standard 6-month control regimen two 4-month treatment regimen treatment tuberculosis ( TB ) . Disease/patients study The trial include 820 patient newly diagnose pulmonary TB sputum positive negative TB microscopy positive result GeneXpert Test organism fully sensitive rifampicin The treatment regimens - Control Experimental Patients enrol trial randomly allocate receive one follow three chemotherapy treatment regimen : 1 . Control regimen ( R10 ) : The standard regimen isoniazid , pyrazinamide ethambutol plus 10 mg/kg rifampicin initial 8 week , follow isoniazid rifampicin ( dose size ) additional 4 month ( 2HRZE/4HR ) A . 2 . Study regimen 1 ( SR1 ) : 2 month daily ethambutol , isoniazid , rifampicin , pyrazinamide follow 2 month daily isoniazid rifampicin . A supplement either 450 mg ( weight band 35-39kg 40-54kg ) 600mg ( weight band 55-69kg 70 kg ) rifampicin give throughout four month ( 2EHR 1200Z/2HR1200 ) B . 3 . Study regimen 2 ( SR2 ) : 2 month daily ethambutol , isoniazid , rifampicin , pyrazinamide follow 2 month daily isoniazid rifampicin . A supplement either 450 mg ( weight band 35-39kg 40-54kg ) 600mg ( weight band 55-69kg 70 kg ) rifampicin give throughout four month ( 2EHR1800Z/2HR1800 ) C. 1.1 Outcome measure Primary outcome measure 1 . Since objective trial reduce treatment duration increase dose rifampicin , primary outcome measure combine rate failure end treatment relapse subsequent 12 month smear positive patient . 2 . The occurrence grade 3 4 adverse event time chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
