	<brief_summary>Proper analgesia total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) important encourage early ambulation , facilitate improve patient outcome early hospital discharge . For pain control TKA , adductor canal block ( ACBs ) improve upon gold standard femoral nerve block ( FNBs ) since cause much quadriceps muscle weakening , provide equivalent analgesia . Multimodal analgesia become commonplace method superior pain control few side effect . Magnesium sulfate adjuvant FNB local anesthetic improve pain control surgery ; however , also prolongs time ambulation . There report effect magnesium sulfate ACBs analgesia TKA . Thus purpose randomize , double-blind , control trial determine whether magnesium sulfate give local anesthetic via ACB prolong analgesia , reduce pain score opioid consumption , increase mobilization TKA patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Adequate analgesia surgery important patient well-being , satisfaction , rapid recovery , timely discharge . Due age population , total knee arthroplasty ( TKAs ) increasingly common surgical procedure Canada , 57,718 perform 2012-2013 alone . Improved functional outcome early hospital discharge facilitate patient ambulate within several hour surgery . Early ambulation enable good analgesia without concomitant muscle weakness debilitate side effect associate opioid consumption . Given high volume knee replacement , need ambulate early , importance effective pain management , development new analgesia technique TKAs important endeavor reduce hospital cost improve quality life substantial number patient . In order minimize adverse side effect still provide adequate postoperative analgesia , many anesthesiologist co-administer small dos several different medication , act additively synergistically depend combine varied mechanisms action . Often medication give locally , either directly knee ( periarticularly ) near nerve innervate knee , example femoral nerve block ( FNB ) adductor canal block ( ACB ) . FNBs , wherein local anesthetic medication inject around femoral nerve , commonly use manage pain follow TKA . Although assist provide quality postoperative pain relief , FNBs also associate weaken quadriceps muscle , increase risk fall . The ACB involve injection local anesthetic ropivacaine bupivacaine adductor canal middle third thigh , contain sensory saphenous nerve . ACB effective FNB reduce postoperative pain TKA patient . However , ACBs cause quadriceps weaken extent FNBs , result earlier recovery ambulation surgery compare FNBs . Since ACBs produce less quadriceps weaken ( due action sensory , rather motor , nerve ) , anesthetic technique may reduce risk fall postoperative period compare FNBs ; however , study underpowered detect statistically . Recent attention give magnesium sulfate ( MgSO4 ) supplement improve and/or prolong local anesthesia postoperatively . MgSO4 think reduce pain via antagonism N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor . A local mechanism action peripheral rather central NMDA receptor support study show despite provide pain relief , peripherally administer MgSO4 increase cerebrospinal fluid concentration magnesium , imply cross blood-brain barrier enter central nervous system . In knee surgery patient , locally administer MgSO4 via periarticular route reduces postoperative pain , reduces cumulative analgesic consumption , prolongs analgesia . MgSO4 co-administered local anesthetic via FNB knee surgery patient reduce pain postoperative analgesic consumption compare local anesthetic alone ; however , also prolongs time ambulation , could delay hospital discharge . Currently , investigation analgesic efficacy MgSO4 administer via ACB TKA patient . Therefore , purpose randomize controlled trial ass duration analgesia TKA patient receive ACBs without MgSO4 . The investigator hypothesize patient receive MgSO4 prolong analgesia , improve pain score , able mobilize , contribute short hospital length stay patient .</detailed_description>
