	<brief_summary>Cold snare polypectomy ( CSP ) common practice proven safe effective technique removal diminutive polyp . Both thick thin wire snare commonly use CSP . However , physical characteristic , thick wire snare might leave high percentage residual adenoma resection site . Since may result high risk recurrence , technique need optimize . Experts suggest thin wire snare might efficient , low risk residual adenoma resection site consequently low risk recurrence interval cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Approximately 90 % polyp small 10 mm . Given risk transformation adenomas invasive cancer year , important adenoma completely resect . This double-blind , prospective , randomize control trial . All eligible patient refer colonoscopy able participate . There 2 treatment arm , one arm treat thin wire snare thick wire snare . Patients randomise computer generate programme blind type snare use . The treatment arm disclose proceduralist introduction colonoscope rectum . After resection polyp defect carefully examine proceduralist . In case suspicion residual adenomatous tissue , re-excision performed . If 's protrusion noticeable resection site , biopsied . Ultimately , margin defect biopsied either side histological confirmation complete removal .</detailed_description>
