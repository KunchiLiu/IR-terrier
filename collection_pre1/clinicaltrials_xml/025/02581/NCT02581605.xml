	<brief_summary>For participant whose leg bone n't line properly , extra stress place either inner out side knee joint due uneven transfer body-weight . Gradually , extra pressure wear away smooth cartilage , result osteoarthritis side knee joint . This problem particularly common young athlete place risk early osteoarthritis . An operation exist whereby one bone either side knee cut ( osteotomy ) hinge open straighten leg . This alteration redistribute body-weight equally across knee joint know effective delaying possibly prevent , progression knee osteoarthritis- especially young physically active patient knee replacement undesirable . Currently possible ( accurately ) calculate precise position bone cut number degree correction require straighten leg use digital x-rays three-dimensional CT scan . However method implement pre-operative plan surgery majority surgeon rely relatively crude ipso facto unreliable intra-operative measurement guide . To improve accuracy operation , investigator propose use custom-made 'cutting block ' , tailor individual patient shape match contour patient 's bone ensure place one position . Pre-cut slot hole guide saw cut number degree bone hinge open , per pre-operative plan ; function intra-operative template surgeon . This study primarily examine whether close match plan actual correction leg deformity use patient-matched cutting-block .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Correction Angular Deformities Knee Arthrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Malalignment leg know play significant role development knee arthrosis . Osteotomy use correct angular deformity around knee . A number study find success procedure delay progression knee arthrosis highly dependent accurate deformity correction . It possible produce precise pre-operative surgical plan osteotomy require favourable outcome . However , majority surgeon still rely upon relatively crude ipso facto unreliable intra-operative measurement guide actual operation . This reflected study compare pre-operative plan final outcome . So facilitate accurate translation pre-operative osteotomy plan intra-operative execution , investigator proposes transfer two technology already commercially available arthroplasty file corrective osteotomy i.e . 3D plan custom-made patient-matched cutting block . This permit translation surgeon 's pre-order ensure precise intra-operative positioning . Once secured slot hole cut block ensure bony cut angular correction perform , secure plate screw , precise location determine pre-operative plan . A prospective multi centre study propose , primarily confirm efficacy use , accuracy deformity correction around knee use patient-matched cutting block . Accuracy assess compare post-operative alignment ( measured plan radiographs CT scan ) pre-operative surgical plan . Patient questionnaire assess outcome also collect , optional gait analysis perform .</detailed_description>
