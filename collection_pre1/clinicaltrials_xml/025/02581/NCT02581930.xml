	<brief_title>Ibrutinib Treating Patients With Refractory Stage IV Cutaneous Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate rate objective response ( OR : complete response [ CR ] + partial response [ PR ] ) ibrutinib administer single agent patient immune checkpoint inhibitor-refractory mitogen-activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) inhibitor-refractory ( B-Raf proto-oncogene , serine/threonine kinase [ BRAF ] V600-mutant ) distant metastatic cutaneous melanoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Estimate progression-free survival ( PFS ) initiation ibrutinib patient immune checkpoint inhibitor-refractory MAPK inhibitor-refractory ( BRAFV600-mutant ) distant metastatic cutaneous melanoma . II . Estimate overall survival ( OS ) initiation ibrutinib patient immune checkpoint inhibitor-refractory MAPK inhibitor-refractory ( BRAFV600-mutant ) distant metastatic cutaneous melanoma . III . Explore association ITK protein expression OR PFS . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Explore association putative target ibrutinib ( e.g . Tec , ErbB4 , Hck , Yes , BTK ) melanoma cell , assess 2-color IF representative tissue section obtain pretreatment archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded ( FFPE ) tumor block FFPE block obtain fresh tissue biopsy enrol patient , OR PFS . II . Explore ibrutinib-mediated effect ( ) immune cell subset associate immunomodulation perform multiparameter flow cytometric analysis peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) obtain prior treatment , day 29 ( i.e. , predose day 1 cycle 2 ) follow initiation treatment ibrutinib , time disease progression ( 3 time point ) . OUTLINE : Patients receive ibrutinib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 1 year .</detailed_description>
