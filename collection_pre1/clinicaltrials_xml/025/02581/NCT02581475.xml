	<brief_title>Efficacy Segmental Examination Twice Proximal Colon Adenoma Detection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Colonoscopy gold standard screen test colorectal cancer ( CRC ) . Removal adenomas reduce incidence mortality CRC . However , evidence patient may develop interval cancers—cancers develop within 3-5 year follow colonoscopy polypectomy . The overall rate interval cancer 1.1-2.7 per 1000 person-years . Several study suggest patient develop interval cancer likely proximal compare distal cancer . One hypothesis adenoma may likely miss proximal colon compare distal colon . Serrated polyps adenoma proximal colon may difficult detect flat , covered mucus , behind fold . A second hypothesis neoplastic lesion proximal colon may biologically differ distal lesion progress malignancy short dwell time . Several tandem back back colonoscopy study demonstrate 27 % adenomas proximal colon miss routine screening colonoscopy . Hover , examine colon twice back back study difficult perform clinical practice . Thus , develop novel colonoscopy technique , segmental examination twice proximal colon , simple easy perform . The current study aim examine efficacy segmental examination twice proximal colon adenoma detection rate ( ADR ) routine screen surveillance colonoscopy .</detailed_description>
