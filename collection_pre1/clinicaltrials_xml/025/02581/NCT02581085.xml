	<detailed_description>As safe natural vitamin , tocotrienol ( TCT ) stand uniquely poise treat ~500 million worldwide suffer viral hepatitis . Furthermore , await liver transplantation , TCT may buy time liver become available . The primary purpose Phase IIA trial validate outcome observe limited sample size Phase I trial ( n=6 ) oral TCT attenuates rise MELD time patient NAFLD , NASH , Hepatitis C. Outcomes direct design multi-center Phase IIB trial . Study participation last 3 year . Subjects see initial visit , consent obtain baseline lab drawn , follow Randomization visit 2-14 day later MELD criterion confirm . If acceptable lab draw per standard care calculate MELD score within 90 day initial visit , subject complete initial visit plan , return repeat lab draw 60 day later confirm MELD criterion eligibility continue randomization visit . Enrollment occur subject meet criteria randomize one treatment group . Subjects see research office research personnel 1 month , 2 month , 3 month , 6 month , 1 year , 18 month , 2 year , 3 year . Subjects receive follow-up phone call 9 month , 15 month , 21 month , 27 month , 30 month , 33 month . Subject compliance supplement closely follow , compliance critical accurate data . Given small sample size , subject less 75 % compliant two consecutive study visit discontinue study . Subjects discontinue MELD score increase 25 % 2 consecutive visit receive organ transplant .
