	<detailed_description>Effect experience PreHomeCare preterm infant use telecommunication Smartphone application : A randomize intervention study . Premature infants patent discharge earlier hospital send home early in-homecare program . Effect study early in-homecare point towards premature infant low risk infection period tube feeding , high parental satisfaction indicate early in-homecare premature infant benefit home visit few readmission less unscheduled support , short length hospital stay long provision breast milk . Standard procedure early in-homecare home visit region Denmark large distance parent/infant possible . No study offer 24-7 hour home visit support . Further research regard use health IT need say , whether use videoconference ( participatory guidance ) Smartphone application ( knowledge data registration ) viable option address parent need support relation early discharge . Main Study : A randomize control intervention study . The aim test effect use video communication mobile application exclusive breastfeeding , parent/infant interaction parental confidence premature infant PreHomeCare . Hypothesis ; Compared parent premature infant receive hospital consultation , parent premature infant access electronic knowledge participatory guidance 24-7 : 1 . Increases proportion exclusive breastfeeding . 2 . Improves parent/infant interaction ( MABISC-mother baby interaction scale ) . 3 . Enhances family ' feel confidence care infant ( KPCS - Karitane parent confidence scale ) . 4 . Increases parent 's knowledge regard premature infant care . Parents randomize either intervention control group via simple randomization procedure . The intervention group receive mobile application videoconference system . The application contain three part ; 1 ) knowledge , 2 ) video contact/participatory guidance 3 ) data registration . Sample Size : Applying significance level 5 % , two-sided two-sample proportion test reveal sample size 39 group maintain power 80 % detect difference consist 55 % vs. 40 % breastfeed woman two group 4 week conditional 66 % breastfeed discharge . This correspond sample size 65 randomisation . To compensate design effect ICC ( 0.01 ) total sample size need thus approximately 160 preterm infant , 80 group . Inclusion criterion : Infants fulfil criterion early in-home care . GA &gt; 34+0 , No need monitoring , tube feeding start breastfeeding/bottle feeding , Danish speak English speaking patent ( understand Danish text application ) . Exclusion criterion : Infants fulfil criterion early in-home care parent , require extra observation parent-infant relationship . Data analysis ; result intervention control group compare analyse follow `` intention treat '' principle . Qualitative evaluation : Sub study 1 : A field observational study : The aim describe characterize nursing practice PreHomeCare parent ' angle home around video consultation . Method base Spradley `` participant observation '' . The focus observation nurse ' communication , act screen etc . The field observation expect enlighten characteristic nurse practice systematic description PreHomeCare set use video consultation . The prose text analyse follow Ricoeur . Sub study 2 : An interview study : The aim explore parent premature infant experience PreHomeCare use video communication mobile application . The study plan conduct inspiration Kvale BrinkmannÂ´s instruction . The main focus interview uncover main question : `` How experience PreHomeCare ? '' particular focus especially meaningful parent PreHomeCare . The verbatim transcribe material analyse follow Ricoeur interpretation theory . Perspectives : This study access new knowledge effect experience PreHomeCare . It give insight need make clear goal quality treatment care premature infants parent last part admission/PreHomeCare . It expect project argument development care premature infant telemedicine use future . The increased effectiveness address challenge help relocate economic professional health service .</detailed_description>
