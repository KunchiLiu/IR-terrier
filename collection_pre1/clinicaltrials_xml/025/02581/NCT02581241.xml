	<detailed_description>The drug-induced long QT syndrome ( diLQTS ) describe clinical entity administration drug produce mark prolongation QT interval electrocardiogram , associate development polymorphic ventricular tachycardia , term torsades de pointes ( TdP ) . Drugs produce diLQTS block repolarizing current , IKr , encode KCNH2 , disease gene type 2 congenital LQTS ( cLQTS ) . Some risk factor drug-specific ( pharmacokinetic factor cytochrome P450 variant ) whereas others ( pharmacodynamic factor ) seem relate myocardial sensitivity across drug . Studies congenital syndrome demonstrate variable penetrance congenital syndrome ; , variability extent mutation carrier display long QT interval , syncope , sudden death . Thus , one pharmacogenetic hypothesis person display diLQTS represent atypical form congenital form syndrome . In fact , minority subject diLQTS rare mutation cLQTS disease gene thus label congenital syndrome . In give family , person LQTS mutation clearly long QT interval , whereas others mutation normal QT interval baseline . In case , latter people , often refer `` latent '' `` subclinical '' LQTS , experience TdP therapy QT-prolonging drug . Indeed , cLQTS disease gene screen , mutation identify 10 % subject diLQTS . The heart rate important variable affect QT interval . The QT interval normally shorten heart rate accelerates ; however , adaptation QT interval sudden heart rate acceleration instantaneous . Animal clinical study show follow abrupt increase ventricular pace rate , take 2 minute ventricular refractory period QT interval shorten new steady state appropriate new ( faster ) rate . Interestingly , Holter study show speed response QT interval sudden change heart rate ( , time take QT interval give person reach new steady-state QT/RR relation ) healthy person highly individual independent basic QTc . The investigator others recently propose `` quick standing '' test simple bedside test facilitates diagnosis congenital LQTS . The test take advantage fact one stand , heart rate acceleration abrupt associate QT-interval shorten gradual . As R-R interval shortens faster QT interval , QT appear `` stretch '' toward next P wave correct QT interval ( QTc ) heart rate actually increase momentarily . The phenomenon `` QT stretching '' universal exaggerate patient LQTS , allow simple accurate diagnostic test . There data effect quick stand drug-associated form long QT syndrome . The investigator therefore propose present study well understand patient drug-associated form long QT syndrome significance abnormal QT-response .</detailed_description>
