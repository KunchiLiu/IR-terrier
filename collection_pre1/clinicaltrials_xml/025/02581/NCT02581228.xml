	<detailed_description>The aim project develop technology application ( termed ML-PrediCare ) , meant predictive stand-alone software device , support clinician ' decision-making , predict individual patient 's response immunotherapy treatment , e.g. , term time-to-progression ( TTP ) . In Stage I study , data collect establish training set assess predictive potential model technology response melanoma patient immunotherapy . In Stage II study , data collect order establish validation set test predictive power model technology independent set patient diagnose melanoma .</detailed_description>
