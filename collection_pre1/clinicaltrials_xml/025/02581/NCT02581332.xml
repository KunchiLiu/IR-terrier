Investigators also test decrease pain rating meditation correspond increase parasympathetic activity . The relative systemic contribution parasympathetic sympathetic branch Autonomic Nervous System ( ANS ) examine measure heart rate variability ( HRV ) , variability beat-to-beat interval . Fast acting , parasympathetically-mediated high frequency ( HF ) change heart rate variability ( HF HRV ; 0.15-0.40 Hz ) provide reliable indicator parasympathetic activity .

	<detailed_description>Mindfulness FM-Related Clinical Pain The lack clinical improvement FM patient response pharmacologic therapy provide support development validation cost-effective , narcotic free , cognitive approach treat FM . If benefit mindfulness-based intervention realize brief mental training , technique could better facilitate treatment pain patient become attractive clinician health insurer . To extent , investigator previously show four day ( 20m/d ) mindfulness meditation train healthy subject significantly reduce experimental pain unpleasantness 57 % pain intensity 40 % compare rest . Additionally , investigator find four day mindfulness-based mental training significantly reduce state anxiety , result realize even one meditation session . However , remain unclear brief mindfulness-based mental training reliably reduce clinical pain FM patient . To extent , investigator test efficacy brief , mindfulness meditation intervention FM-related pain . Providing short , potentially effective intervention could offset physical , temporal , financial barrier treatment FM patient . Mindfulness FM-Related Experimental Pain FM patient find low pain threshold across multiple noxious stimulation modality suffer hyperalgesia , increased sensitivity pain . While pain threshold correspond point stimulus experience painful , sensitivity pain refers individual 's subjective experience noxious stimulus . Unfortunately , know study examine effect mindfulness meditation FM-related heat pain threshold heat pain sensitivity . The employment experimentally induce pain manipulation could provide mean disentangle constellation interaction affect subjective experience FM-related pain . To extent , addition examine effect mindfulness meditation clinical pain , investigator also employ psychophysical methodology determine mindfulness meditation attenuate experimentally induced pain FM patient . Heart Rate Variability ( HRV ) Fibromyalgia The Autonomic Nervous System ( ANS ) critical control homeostatic measure blood pressure , body temperature , heart rate . HRV , variability beat-to-beat interval , use assess systemic relative contribution parasympathetic sympathetic branch ANS . Parasympathetic effect heart rate mediate vagus nerve relatively quickly , thus classify high frequency change heart rate ( HF HRV ; 0.15-0.40 Hz ) marker parasympathetic activity . Interestingly , decrease HF HRV provide robust physiological correlate subjective experience pain . In fact , decrease HF HRV directly associate number clinical pain condition include fibromyalgia . Additionally , recent finding show meditation directly increase HF HRV . Investigators therefore employ psychophysical physiological methodology test hypothesis analgesic effect mindfulness meditation FM patient associated increase HF HRV . Specific Aims To examine effect brief mindfulness meditation intervention clinical pain ( primary outcome ) experimental pain ( secondary outcome ) FM patient compare wait-list control condition . Investigators also examine analgesic effect mindfulness meditation correlate increase HF HRV . Hypotheses Investigators hypothesize brief mindfulness meditation intervention decrease clinical experimental pain FM patient compare wait-list control condition . Investigators hypothesize analgesic effect meditation correlate increase HF HRV . Investigators also predict meditation decrease depression , state anxiety , overall disease severity , perceive stress , increase quality sleep , mindfulness skill comparison pre-intervention score wait-list control group . Study Objectives Primary Objective : The primary objective study determine brief mindfulness meditation intervention improve FM-related clinical pain . Based prior research , investigator ' work hypothesis intervention decrease severity FM-associated pain comparison pre-intervention score wait-list control group . Secondary Objective : The secondary objective study determine brief mindfulness-based meditation intervention impact number factor associate FM prove feasible intervention patient population , measure attrition rate le 25 % . First , investigator test hypothesis mindfulness meditation , comparison wait-list control group pre-intervention experimental pain rating , reduce subjective experience experimentally induce pain FM patient . Specifically , base preliminary study , investigator hypothesize brief mindfulness meditation intervention decrease heat pain sensitivity increase heat pain threshold patient population ( see Interventions Interactions ) . Additionally , investigator test hypothesis decrease clinical and/or experimental pain cause mindfulness meditation associate increase HF HRV . Finally , investigator test brief mindfulness-based meditation intervention improve psychological disposition FM patient . Based prior work , investigator postulate mindfulness meditation training decrease ) depression , b ) state anxiety , c ) overall disease severity , ) perceive stress , increase e ) quality sleep , f ) mindfulness skill comparison pre-intervention score wait-list control group .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Sixty individual ( 1865 year old ; male female ) ethnic background examine . Participants meet 2010 revise American College Rheumatology ( ACR ) criterion FM . Additionally , patient medication regimen FM past four week include . Patients must also report score great equal 50 Revised FM Impact Questionnaire ( FIQR ) score less 20 Patient Health Questionnaire8 ( PHQ8 ) include study . Importantly , Dr. Dennis Ang confirm FM diagnosis . Individuals chronic heart lung condition , pregnant , smoke , currently wait response application disability , diagnose schizophrenia , bipolar , mental illness personality disorder , plan undergoing major elective surgery next three month exclude .
