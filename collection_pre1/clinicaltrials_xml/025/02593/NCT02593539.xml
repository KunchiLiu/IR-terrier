To date GSK2269557 administer healthy subject ( smoker non smoker ) , subject : stable Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) ; subject experience COPD exacerbation ; subject persistent , uncontrolled asthma . As study first administration GSK2269557 subject APDS , study provide safety , tolerability , efficacy pharmacokinetic data patient population . Up 20 subject enrol study . The total duration study approximately 30 week , include pre-screening/screening follow-up .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Male female subject age 18 old time signing informed consent . Patients clinical phenotype consistent APDS , include history recurrent ( frequency great would expect immunocompetent individual ) ear , sinus pulmonary infection , know type 1 APDSassociated genetic PI3K delta mutation ( i.e .

Male subject female partner child bear potential must comply follow contraception requirement time first dose study medication completion followup telephone call 12 week last dose . Vasectomy documentation azoospermia . Male condom plus partner use one follow contraceptive option : 1 . Contraceptive subdermal implant 2 . Intrauterine device intrauterine system 3 . Combined estrogen progestogen oral contraceptive , 4 . Injectable progestogen 5 . Contraceptive vaginal ring 6 . Percutaneous contraceptive patch . This inclusive list method meet GSK definition highly effective : failure rate le 1 % per year use consistently , correctly , applicable , accordance product label . For nonproduct method ( e.g . male sterility ) , investigator determines consistent correct use . The GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) definition base definition provide International Conference Harmonisation ( ICH ) . Female subject . A female subject eligible participate pregnant ( confirm negative urine human chorionic gonadotrophin [ hCG ] test ) , lactate , least one follow condition applies : 1 . Nonreproductive potential define : Premenopausal females one following : Documented tubal ligation , Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure followup confirmation bilateral tubal occlusion , Hysterectomy , Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy . Postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea ( questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone [ FSH ] estradiol level consistent menopause ) . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one highly effective contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrolment . 2 . Reproductive potential agrees follow one option list Modified List Highly Effective Methods Avoiding Pregnancy Females Reproductive Potential ( FRP ) 30 day prior first dose study medication completion followup telephone call 12 week last dose .

Current chronic history liver disease except hepatomegaly identify clinician secondary APDS , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . Corrected QT interval ( QTc ) &gt; 450 millisecond ( msec ) QTc &gt; 480 msec subject Bundle Branch Block A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter ( ) is/are specifically list inclusion exclusion criterion , outside reference range population study may include investigator , consultation Medical Monitor require , agree document find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . Regular chronic treatment strong inhibitor Cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3A4 and/or CYP2D6 ( include antiepileptic treatment , macrolide antibiotic , oral antifungal treatment antituberculosis therapy prohibit screen visit end treatment visit . Where clinically appropriate , alternative drug class ( unrelated class ) strong CYP3A4 and/or CYP2D6 inhibitor , sign informed consent , substitute original strong inhibitor enzyme Use unstable dose regimen intravenous ( i.v . ) immunoglobulin ( Ig ) /subcutaneous ( s.c. ) Ig last 6 month screen . Stable maintenance immunoglobulin regimen , per local practice , regular injection consistent dose interval ( e.g . monthly ) acceptable . Previous use mechanistic target rapamycin ( mTOR ) antagonist ( e.g . rapamycin , everolimus ) PI3K delta inhibitor ( selective nonselective PI3K inhibitor ) . History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study define average weekly intake &gt; 21 unit male &gt; 14 unit female .
