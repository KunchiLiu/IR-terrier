	<brief_title>Dynamic CT Myocardial Perfusion Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>If clinically indicate CCTA myocardial perfusion examination indicate , first single ultra low dose CT scan perform look late enhancement potentially scar myocardium . Together contrast agent co-injection clinically indicated tracer 99mTc-Tetrofosmin performed later scintigraphic perfusion evaluation . After stress perfusion image CT rest perfusion image perform similar fashion . After acquisition CT rest perfusion image scintigraphic stress rest image acquisition perform daily clinical routine additional administration 99mTc-Tetrofosmin rest dose necessary . CT stress rest perfusion compare clinically indicate well establish SPECT examination .</detailed_description>
