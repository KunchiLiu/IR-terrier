	<brief_summary>The TELEX trial establish whether telmisartan alone improves walk performance people peripheral artery disease ( PAD ) . The TELEX trial also determine whether telmisartan plus supervised exercise improve walk performance either therapy alone . TELEX randomize controlled clinical trial ( 2 x 2 factorial design ) 240 participant PAD randomize one four arm : Group A : telmisartan + supervise exercise therapy ; Group B : telmisartan + `` exercise '' control group ; Group C : placebo + supervise exercise therapy ; Group D : placebo + `` exercise '' control group .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All participant PAD . PAD define follow . First , ABI &lt; = 0.90 baseline study visit inclusion criterion PAD . Second , potential participant ABI &gt; 0.90 â‰¤ 1.00 experience 20 % high drop ABI heelrise exercise eligible . Third , potential participant ABI &gt; 0.90 vascular lab evidence PAD angiographic evidence PAD eligible . Finally , potential participant history low extremity revascularization meet criterion ABI &gt; 0.90 20 % high drop ABI heelrise exercise eligible . 1 . Above knee amputation , critical limb ischemia , wheelchair confinement , inability walk without walker , current foot ulcer . 2 . Walking limited condition PAD . 3 . &gt; Class II NYHA heart failure angina , increase angina , angina rest , abnormal baseline treadmill stress test . Potential participant may become eligible follow abnormal baseline treadmill stress test evidence absence coronary ischemia base test physician . 4 . Currently take angiotensin receptor blocker ACE inhibitor use medication past three month . 5 . Currently take aliskiren ( Tekturna ) . 6 . Blood pressure &lt; 110/55 baseline potassium &gt; 5.0 meq/L baseline . 7 . Blood pressure &lt; 100/50 runin potassium &gt; = 5.5 meq/L end runin . 8 . Severe hepatic impairment define two liver function enzyme value great 2.5 upper limit normal . 9 . Acute decline renal function telmisartan , define 30 % great decline eGFR follow twoweek runin compare baseline . 10 . Allergy ARBs . 11 . Failure successfully complete 2week study runin , define fail attend health education treadmill exercise runin session and/or fail take study medication daily 10 day twoweek period ( i.e . one pill per day &gt; 10 day 14 day runin period ) . 12 . Surgery include low extremity revascularization , coronary revascularization stenting , orthopedic surgery past 3 month anticipate next 6 month myocardial infarction stroke past 3 month . 13 . Major medical illness include renal disease require dialysis , lung disease require oxygen , Parkinson 's disease , lifethreatening illness life expectancy less six month , cancer require treatment previous two year . [ NOTE : potential participant may still qualify treatment early stage cancer past two year prognosis excellent . Participants use oxygen night may still qualify . ] 14 . MMSE score &lt; 23 dementia . 15 . Currently walk regularly exercise level similar study intervention . 16 . Participation another clinical trial cardiac rehabilitation completion clinical trial cardiac rehabilitation previous three month . [ NOTE : completing stem cell gene therapy intervention , participant become eligible final study followup visit stem cell gene therapy study long least six month pass since final intervention administration . After complete exercise intervention supplement drug therapy ( stem cell gene therapy ) , participant eligible final study followup visit long least three month pass since final intervention trial . ] 17 . NonEnglish speaking , visual impairment limit walk ability , hear impairment interferes study participation . 18 . Heart failure ejection fraction &lt; 40 % baseline . 19 .
