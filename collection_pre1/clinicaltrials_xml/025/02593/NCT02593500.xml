	<brief_summary>A SINGLE CENTER , SINGLE DOSE , OPEN-LABEL , RANDOMIZED , TWO PERIOD CROSSOVER STUDY TO DETERMINE THE BIOEQUIVALENCE OF TWO INHALATION FORMULATIONS CONTAINING BUDESONIDE 200 µg ADMINISTERED AS 3 PUFFS ( TOTAL DOSE OF 600 µg ) IN AT LEAST 52 HEALTHY MALES AND FEMALES UNDER FASTING CONDITIONS The study objective determine whether inhaled test product , budesonide 200 µg ( pressurized inhalation suspension ) inhale reference product , Budesonida Pulmictan® 200 µg ( budesonide ; pressurize inhalation suspension ) bioequivalent . For purpose PK profile budesonide compare administration single dose 600 µg ( 3 puff ) two inhalation formulation , fast condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Bioequivalence Study Two Inhalation Formulations Containing Budesonide 200 µg</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The sponsor develop new formulation ( test product ) exist medication ( reference product ) intend variation exist marketing authorization . The propose study healthy male female design establish PK profile fast condition orally inhaled test reference product evaluate bioequivalence . This single-dose , open-label , laboratory-blind , randomize , two-period crossover study inhalation administer budesonide200 µg conductedunder fast condition inat least 52 healthy male femalesat single study center . The study comprise : - Screening period , include serum cortisol level document inhalation training , maximum 21 day ; - Two treatment period ( include profile period 24 hour ) separate wash-out period 7 calendar day ( minimum number day base half-life analyte ) 14 calendar day ( maximum number day base logistical arrangement ) consecutive administration IMP ; - A post-study visit within 72 hour completion last treatment period study . Participants assign randomly treatment sequence , prior first administration IMP .</detailed_description>
