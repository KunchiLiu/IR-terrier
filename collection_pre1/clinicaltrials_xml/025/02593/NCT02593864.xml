If blood test provide early warning cartilage wear joint deterioration , Veterans could potentially treat early enough slow even prevent OA . So far , development blood test prove elusive . The investigator propose new method amplify sign cartilage wear blood challenging affect joint walking task . Similar cardiac stress test , walk challenge may help separate joint risk healthy joint . The investigator also see 'OA stress test ' show simple inexpensive load-modifying shoe improve joint health Veterans early knee OA .</brief_summary>
