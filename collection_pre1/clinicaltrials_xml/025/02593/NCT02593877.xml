	<brief_summary>This trial compare haemostatic effect viscoelastic haemostatic assay ( VHA ) -guided transfusion strategy versus non-VHA guided transfusion strategy haemorrhaging trauma patient . Half randomise patient receive VHA-led management bleeding , whilst half receive massive transfusion protocol resuscitation use conventional coagulation test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Trauma frequent cause death person age 40 , half death result uncontrolled bleeding . 1 4 severely injured shock patient develop clot abnormality term Trauma Induced Coagulopathy ( TIC ) within minute injury , cause blood continue lose body faster stem . Many injured patient go develop different type coagulopathy different time course treatment , either result body 's ongoing response trauma consequence clinical care . Ultimately coagulopathic patient increase blood transfusion requirement suffer adverse outcome ( e.g . multi organ failure ) . Current management coagulopathic , haemorrhaging trauma patient comprise unguided transfusion large volume red blood cell clot product supplement . Without rapidly available validated diagnostics , product deliver empirically patient blind type severity TIC may indeed even TIC . This study compare outcomes viscoelastic haemostatic assay ( VHA ) -guided resuscitation versus conventional management critically bleed trauma patient . The hypothesis goal-directed haemostatic resuscitation coagulopathic bleed trauma patient yield improve outcome reduce blood product demand , compare empiric massive transfusion therapy .</detailed_description>
