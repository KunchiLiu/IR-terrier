	<brief_summary>This Phase II trial evaluate safety immunogenicity two dos Folate Receptor Alpha ( FRα ) peptide vaccine mixed GM-CSF vaccine adjuvant , without immune prim cyclophosphamide , consolidation therapy neoadjuvant adjuvant treatment patient Stage IIb-III triple negative breast cancer ( TNBC ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Folate Receptor Alpha Peptide Vaccine With GM-CSF Patients With Triple Negative Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Triple negative breast cancer ( TNBCs ) occur approximately 20-25 % patient breast cancer associate poor prognosis . Patients TNBCs derive benefit targeted therapy . Excluding patient demonstrate pathologic complete response follow neoadjuvant chemotherapy , minor fraction ( i.e . 15 % ) , overall survival 45 % 7 year . Following standard care , windows opportunity safely treat patient prevent recurrence . Stimulating immune system produce T cell immunity specific tumor antigen may significantly delay recurrence cure patient . The propose vaccine intend induce T cell survey reemergence TNBCs prevent recurrence adjuvant setting . The vaccine strategy antigen-specific target Folate Receptor Alpha ( FRα ) . FRα ideal target limited expression healthy tissue high expression 86 % TNBCs . Studies show biologically important marker associate poorer clinical outcome retain metastatic lesion . The FRα vaccine include pool 5 peptide immunogenic epitope safely generate tissue-surveying CD4 T cell immune responses patient test recently complete phase I clinical trial .</detailed_description>
