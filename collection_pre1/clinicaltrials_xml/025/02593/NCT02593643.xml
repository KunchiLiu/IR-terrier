	<detailed_description>Depression suicidal ideation/attempt/death major cause morbidity mortality psychiatric illness . The World Health Organization ( 2009 ) list depression lead cause year lose due disability worldwide . Suicide 9th common cause death Canada 1.6 % Canadians ultimately die suicide ( Statistics Canada , 2012 ) 2nd common cause death young people accidental death . The investigator ' data show least 50 % people die suicide Toronto suffer depression small proportion ~12 % suffer BD . These data underscore urgency develop new treatment MDD BD also suicidality often associate . Ketamine treatment represent potentially viable , safe effective treatment MDD/bipolar depression + SI . The Investigators therefore propose conduct pilot trial preparation full- scale randomize control trial ( RCT ) would aim determine efficacy IV ketamine + standard medication treatment ( Treatment As Usual ; TAU ) vs. midazolam , `` active '' placebo + TAU treat SI among inpatient MDD inpatient bipolar depression . If full-scale RCT demonstrate ketamine 's efficacy , would important implication future research well inpatient treatment . The primary objective conduct pilot trial IV ketamine + TAU vs. midazolam + TAU estimate sample size full-scale RCT examine treatment decrease SI among depressed inpatient MDD bipolar depression . The primary hypothesis effect size reduce SI ketamine group vs. midazolam group moderate range ( &gt; 0.5 14 42 day ) term reduction score Scale Suicidal Ideation ( SSI ) Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( CSSRS ) subject MDD subject bipolar depression . Further , secondary objective secondary hypothesis . The secondary objective : 1 . To estimate effect size produce clinical response ( ≥50 % reduction Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) score ) remission ( MADRS &lt; 12 ) ketamine group vs. midazolam group 14 42 day MDD bipolar depression . 2 . To determine whether ketamine group produce rapid reduction SSI , CSSRS MADRS score compare midazolam group MDD bipolar depression . 3 . [ bipolar depression stream ] To determine whether ketamine midazolam induce manic symptom subject , , whether ketamine produce manic symptom subject midazolam . Secondary hypothesis : 1 . Effect size achieve clinical response remission ketamine group vs. midazolam group moderate range ( &gt; 0.5 14 42 day ) . 2 . There significantly rapid reduction SSI , CSSRS MADRS score ketamine group midazolam group . 3 . [ bipolar depression stream ] Manic symptom occur &lt; 10 % subject differences two group . Finally , exploratory objective : 1 . To determine whether mean time discharge differs ketamine midazolam group MDD bipolar depression . 2 . To determine whether subject satisfaction differs ketamine group midazolam group . And exploratory hypothesis : 1 . Mean time discharge hospital faster ketamine midazolam group MDD bipolar depression . 2 . Subject satisfaction high ketamine midazolam group MDD bipolar depression . Subjects inpatient Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre diagnosis either MDD BD type I II currently depress . To include study , SI must present time baseline assessment . Subjects recruit first regular week day ( non-weekend/holiday ) admission . This day comprehensive inpatient treatment plan typically develop . Subjects randomize 1:1 double-blind fashion two group MDD BD stream . That , 13 subject randomize ketamine + TAU 13 subject randomize midazolam + TAU stream subject MDD . Likewise 26 subject bipolar depression randomize two treatment . Subjects ketamine IV group receive infusion 3 time weekly two week ( 0.5 mg/kg infuse 40 minute approximately day 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 12 admission ) . The exact schedule date refer approximate since may need adjust slightly depend time admission/weekends etc . Subjects midazolam group dose schedule instead receive midazolam 0.045 mg/kg IV infuse 40 minute . A sub-anesthetic dose midazolam choose active placebo CNS effect include sedation amnestic effect , thus make difficult subject guess group . Vital sign include pulse , respiratory rate arterial oxygen saturation monitor throughout ketamine/midazolam infusion one hour post-infusion standard publish literature . If subject experience side effect , protocol allow infusion slow 90 minute . Subjects also receive TAU course study addition IV ketamine midazolam treatment . In MDD group , TAU may include newly initiate longstanding antidepressant . In BD group , TAU may include mood stabilizer lithium valproate first second line agent per Canadian Network Mood Anxiety Treatments ( CANMAT ) guideline ( Yatham et al. , 2013 ) . This do attempt mitigate risk relapse cessation ketamine therapy also make use midazolam treatment ethically justifiable . The duration study two week . All subject receive 6 treatment , regardless whether symptom remit , give recent evidence 6 IV ketamine treatment lead robust lasting response compare 1-3 treatment ( Aan Het Rot et al. , 2012 ) . If subject discharge 2 week , ask return hospital outpatient remain ketamine treatment well outcome measure 2-weeks 42 day . TAU maintain discharge . Depression , suicidal ideation measure ( MADRS , SSI , CSSRS ) , BD stream , mania measure ( Young Mania Rating Scale ; YMRS ) administer admission , treatment day morning prior ketamine/midazolam administration day 14 42 . At day 14 42 , subject also ask rate satisfaction study .</detailed_description>
