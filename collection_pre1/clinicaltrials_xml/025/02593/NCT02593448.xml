	<brief_summary>The purpose present study ass , near infrared spectroscopy INVOS oximeter vascular occlusion test ( VOT ) , influence cardiopulmonary bypass tissue saturation thenar muscle . The secondary aim compare effect propofol sevoflurane anaesthesia tissue saturation . It prospective , randomize , open-label study . Sixty cardiac surgery patient receive either propofol sevoflurane anaesthesia . Three-minute VOT perform follow time point : 30 minute anaesthesia induction , directly sternotomy , 20 40 minute aortic cross-clamping , 20 minute aortic cross-clamp removal , 45 minute wean cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) . Group time effect tissue saturation analyse ANOVA post hoc Tukey 's test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) modern technique cardiac surgical patient monitoring . The NIRS method base Lambert-Beer 's law , define relationship concentration substance reduction intensity electro-magnetic radiation . This reduction result photon absorption chromatophores , include haemoglobin , myoglobin cytochrome P1 . Absorption give wave-length depends degree chromatophore oxygenation , hence allows assessment . NIRS currently commonly use assessment brain oximetry thoracic aorta surgery , increasingly often , open-heart surgery . Algorithms sustain adequate brain saturation report decrease incidence neurological complication follow cardiac surgery . In recent year , NIRS propose tool assessment muscle saturation short-term ischaemia reperfusion , refer vascular occlusion test ( VOT ) . VOT provocative test tissue saturation ( StO2 ) measure peripheral site , thenar eminence , blood flow transiently occlude sphygmomanometer . After reach predefined ischaemia time minimal StO2 threshold , sphygmomanometer tourniquet rapidly deflate blood flow muscle restore . Tissue saturation measurement VOT identify early disturbance tissue metabolism perfusion . The speed decrease tissue saturation ischaemia propose reflect local metabolic rate , low tissue saturation propose reflect extent ischaemia . The speed tissue saturation recovery reperfusion shock patient propose measure microvascular capacity increase blood flow transient ischaemia . The result recent study indicate speed fall muscle saturation VOT reduce septic shock , decrease speed saturation recovery reperfusion relate disturbed microcirculation , example hypovolemic shock . An understanding anaesthetic influence cardiac surgical procedure tissue saturation profile VOT essential future use tool assessment condition patient CPB cardiac surgery .</detailed_description>
