	<brief_summary>The study determine whether standard medical care ( dopamine ) affect learn retention postural step task people Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) whether train postural step task generalises performance untrained postural task . Half participant train step task take first dose dopamine day ( i.e . `` '' medication state ) half train step task take first daily dose dopamine ( i.e . `` '' medication state ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Impact Standard Medical Care ( Dopamine ) Practice Postural Motor Learning Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Motor learn critical acquire new skill adapt behaviour , therefore success rehabilitation depend successful motor learning practice . Motor learn involves basal ganglion , include associative sensorimotor striatum . Although people PD capable motor learning , less efficient achieve extent skill acquisition retention people without neurological deficit . Reductions endogenous dopamine reduce dopamine binding associate loss dopaminergic receptor due disease progression may impair motor learn people PD . Conflicting evidence suggest impaired motor learn PD due one hand absence dopamine hand `` overdosing '' basal ganglion dopamine replacement therapy suppress activation associative striatum early acquisition stage motor learning . Understanding factor improve degrade motor learn task allow rehabilitation parameter adjust around standard medical care order optimize learn improve efficacy exercise intervention people PD . In particular , successful learn postural task challenge stability may turn reduce fall .</detailed_description>
