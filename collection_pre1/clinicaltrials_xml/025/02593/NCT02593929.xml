	<brief_title>Pharmacodynamic Effects Predictive Biomarkers With Ruxolitinib Operable Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , ruxolitinib administer short period 2-3 week prior plan surgical resection HNSCC . The dose 20 mg twice daily , FDA-approved dose myelofibrosis . The brief treatment duration within expect window time elapse initial patient evaluation surgeon performance surgery . In phase 0 window trial model , pair specimen analysis permit ex vivo evaluation target modulation pharmacodynamic change downstream parallel molecular pathways.32 This study design optimal order ass biochemical immunomodulatory effect ruxolitinib HNSCC . Furthermore , predictive biomarkers develop related clinical endpoint biochemical , pharmacodynamic endpoint .</detailed_description>
