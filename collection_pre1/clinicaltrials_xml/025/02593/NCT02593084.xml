	<brief_title>Resistance Training Optimize Health Pre-frail Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It critically important identify effective strategy reduce risk impact mobility disability frailty old adult . Exercise , particularly resistance training ( RT ) , potential influence person 's ability navigate around environment impact component frailty phenotype include weakness , physical inactivity , slowness . Higher training intensity use athlete young adult achieve great gain strength , feasibility effectiveness less establish old person exhibit preclinical disability , at-risk mobility decline conservative protocol typically employ . Higher intensity RT may innovative effective strategy preclinical disability pre-frailty reduce risk impact future frailty mobility decline . This study aim examine : 1 ) safety feasibility 12-week high intensity RT protocol community dwell old adult risk mobility disability , 2 ) effect protocol walk , balance , muscle strength , quality life compare low intensity RT It hypothesize high intensity RT : 1 ) safe feasible at-risk community-dwelling older adult , 2 ) effective improve walking , balance , muscle strength , quality life low intensity RT</detailed_description>
