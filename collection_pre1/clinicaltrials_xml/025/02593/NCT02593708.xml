	<detailed_description>Neratinib potent , irreversible , small molecule panErbB inhibitor EGFR , HER2 HER4 tyrosine kinase . Its activity prevents autophosphorylation HER2 thus halt downstream activation key proliferative pathway tumor dependent HER2 overexpression EGFR activation . It show promising clinical activity woman HER2+ stage 2 3 breast cancer neoadjuvant setting ( I-SPY 2 TRIAL ) woman stage 4 metastatic breast cancer , although evaluation large phase 3 trial require confirm result . The rationale study determine feasibility add neratinib taxane base chemotherapy approve HER2 antagonist , trastuzumab pertuzumab . The study evaluate safety tolerability recommend dose daily neratinib combination weekly paclitaxel , trastuzumab tri-weekly pertuzumab patient HER2+ advance metastatic disease , successful , determine optimal dose move phase II/III test combination neoadjuvant setting .</detailed_description>
