	<brief_summary>The purpose project evaluate efficacy Sitting Together And Reaching To Play ( START-Play ) , intervention design target sit , reach , motor-based problem solve improve development readiness learn infant motor delay dysfunction . There limited research examine efficacy early physical intervention infant neuromotor dysfunction . In addition , early motor intervention directly link learning , despite research demonstrate association motor activity cognitive skill . START-Play specifically target motor skill lead great physical exploration , associate improve problem solve global development . A randomized controlled trial START-Play conduct across four state investigate impact intervention change time sit reaching , subsequent change global cognitive development , mediate influence motor skill change problem solving . The research team conduct randomize control trial evaluate impact START-Play motor development , motor problem solving , global development include cognitive problem solve infant neuromotor delay dysfunction . Infants experience either intervention service usual 3 month , follow test three time point 9 month post intervention . The researcher determine whether intervention lead improved sit reaching , lead improved motor-based problem solving , lead improved global development problem solving .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Efficacy START-Play Program Infants With Neuromotor Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Setting : The research take place home infant family Pennsylvania , Delaware , Washington , Virginia . Sample : There approximately 140 infant neuromotor disorder complete participation study , begin age age 7 16 month , well family interventionists . Infants gross motor delay able sit prop least 3 second recruited participation . Intervention : Sitting Together And Reaching To Play ( START-Play ) intervention infant motor dysfunction delay physical therapist visit child 's home target work siting , reach , problem solving . The therapist visit home twice weekly 3 month . During visit , therapist family work together provide intensive , individualized , daily activity advance reach sit small increment challenge support skill , become building block motor-based problem solve . More specifically , intervention focus self-initiated , goal-directed movement build orientation attention object , learn basic relationship cause effect . Infants family intervention group receive intervention addition usual early intervention service . Research Design Methods : This study use randomize controlled trial infant family randomly assign intervention group ( START-Play addition usual service ) control group ( usual early intervention service ) , stratify severity neuromotor disorder . There six measurement session 12-week intervention period , follow assessment 1- , 3- , 9-month follow-up visit . The study aim determine efficacy intervention sit reach ( proximal outcome ) motor-based problem solve skill ( longer-term proximal outcome ) , hypothesize serve mediator distal outcome global cognitive development readiness learn . The investigator also explore fidelity implementation identify condition support fidelity outcome , well identify moderate factor relate child ( severity disorder , health , age , cognitive skill entry ) , family ( socioeconomic status , home environment ) , service ( fidelity implementation , service provide child ) explore change time . Control Condition : Infants family control condition continue receive regular Part C early intervention service . Key Measures : Primary outcome measure study include Gross Motor Function Measure observational measure toy contact sit reaching , Individual Growth Development Indicators ( Early Problem Solving Indicator ) Bayley Scales Infant Toddler Development -Third Edition problem solve global development . Secondary measure include additional measure postural control reaching , child family characteristic , fidelity implementation ( logs checklist ) . Data Analytic Strategy : The investigator use linear mixed modeling ( LMM ) determine efficacy intervention child outcome . Parallel process growth model within structural equation model framework use examine whether improvement sit reach mediator lead improvement problem solving , mediator lead long-term global cognitive development . LMM also use examine moderating variable , well secondary motor outcome .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>• Infants enter study 716 month age , able prop sit 3 second maintain head least level neutral alignment trunk . Gross motor delay reflect Bayley III motor subtest &gt; 1.0 Standard Deviation mean . Neuromotor disorder cerebral palsy ( CP ) , risk CP extreme prematurity brain damage occur around birth , infant motor delay unspecified origin ( clear diagnosis , delay ) • Minimal movement requirements/Indicators readiness change : Sits support arm 3 second place . Exhibits least spontaneous movement arm . • Medical complication severely limit participation assessment intervention severe visual congenital/genetic anomaly , uncontrolled seizure disorder . Diagnosis unchanging neuromotor disorder ( example : autism , Down syndrome , spinal cord injury , acquire head injury , muscle disorder ) . A child exclude parent report follow : 1 ) child disability progressive nature muscular dystrophy ; 2 ) child 's family plan move local area within one year start study ; 3 ) child major surgery plan might affect physical performance .</criteria>
