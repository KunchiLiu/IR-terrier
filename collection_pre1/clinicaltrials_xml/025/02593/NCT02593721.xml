	<brief_title>Hypoalgesic Effect Neural Mobilization Versus Ibuprofen Pharmacologic Treatment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Median Nerve Neural Mobilization Ibuprofen relieve cervicobrachial pain , happen different mechanism different onset side effect . Median Nerve Neural Mobilization physical therapy technique achieve pain relief mechanical stimulation median nerve brachial plexus . The proper mechanical stimulation nerve surround neural tissue induces wide variety physiologic response may reduce cervicobrachial pain include activation descend nervous system pain modulation mechanism , though entire set underlie reason pain reduction completely understood . Among effect cause Neural Tissue Mobilization produce pain relief : intraneural edema reduction , change intraneural nerve pressure , dispersion pro-inflammatory substance increase nerve mobility Ibuprofen nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use worldwide control pain , fever inflammation.Oral intake Ibuprofen produce hypoalgesic effect due biochemical inhibition COX enzymes , convert arachidonic acid prostaglandin H2 ( PGH2 ) . PGH2 , turn , convert enzymes several type prostaglandin thromboxanes ( mediator pain inflammation ) . Side effect derive oral intake Ibuprofen related systemic action severe patient . This fact suggest oral Ibuprofen may suitable use type patient suffer cervicobrachial pain , meanwhile Median Nerve Neural Mobilization little side effect know . This reveal point interest determine comparative effectiveness two therapeutic option treatment cervicobrachial pain .</detailed_description>
