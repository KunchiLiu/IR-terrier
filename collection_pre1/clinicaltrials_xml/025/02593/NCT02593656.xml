	<brief_summary>This study systematically quantified effect Isagenix Performance System ( IEPS ) compare standard recommend control ( C ) diet combine 4-day/week exercise training program total regional ( abdominal ) body composition ( lean mass fat mass ) , muscular strength performance , flexibility , blood lipid glucose , hormone , mood state energy metabolism 60 healthy middle-aged ( 25-55 year old ) men woman follow 12-week intervention . Participants enrol one two cohort : 1 . Isagenix Energy &amp; Performance System , 2g/kg/Body Weight ( BW ) Protein ( IEPS ) ( n=30 ) 1 . IEPS-I , n=15 ; consume protein feed immediately exercise 2 . IEPS-2 , n=15 ; consume protein feed 2 hour exercise 2 . Control , 1g/kg/Body Weight Protein ( C ) ( n=30 )</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Participants match body weight , body mass index ( BMI ) percent body fat ( % BF ) randomly assign one two group : ( 1 ) Isagenix Energy &amp; Performance System 2.0 g/kg Body Weight per day protein combine exercise training ( IEPS , n=30 ) ; ( 2 ) control ( C ) diet contain 1.0 g/kg Body Weight per day protein combine exercise training ( C , n=30 ) . All participant follow program progressive exercise train 12 week . All test procedure ( see ) administer pre-intervention post intervention . Participants group provide meal plan instruct follow meal plan throughout intervention . Participants IEPS provide two shake 1 bar meal replacement day help meet 2.0 g/kg Body Weight protein per day . Participants give 2-wk supply supplement ask return empty packet receive next two-week 's supply mean assess compliance . C participant require follow healthy meal plan provide 1.0 g/kg Body Weight protein per day consume whole food meal . They provide additional protein supplement . However , provide food supply consist granola bar , chocolate milk , fruit help meet 1.0 g/kg BW protein per day . They also ask return empty food packet monitor compliance . Similar dietary intervention two propose study use successfully past PI adverse event report . Prior start study , subject familiarize exercise training protocol participate eight supervise exercise session two-week period ( 4 time per week ) Skidmore College fitness weight training room locate adjacent Health &amp; Exercise Sciences Department . Participants ask perform exercise session Skidmore College first two week option perform one two exercise ( I , E ) home local gym follow two week familiarization . Participants require perform 4 exercise session per week follow exercise : ) resistance training ( R ) ; b ) interval sprint training ( I ) ; c ) stretch training ( S ) ; ) endurance training ( E ) . During course intervention , member research team periodically `` checked-in '' ( weekly ) participant phone , email , in-person answer question provide guidance exercise dietary intake . All exercise training guideline recommendation follow American College Sports Medicine , exercise intensity base individual fitness level health status .</detailed_description>
