	<brief_title>The Effects High Intensity Exercise Training Program Patients With Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary outcome measure change sleep efficiency ( number minute asleep divide number minute bed ) , measure polysomnography . In addition , patient Parkinson 's disease excessive sleepiness/impaired vigilance ( alertness ) impair motor function , might expect improve exercise intervention , study also assess vigilance motor outcome .</detailed_description>
