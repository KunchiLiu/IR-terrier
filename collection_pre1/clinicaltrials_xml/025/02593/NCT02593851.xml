	<brief_title>A Study Assess Pharmacokinetics , Safety , Tolerability Multiple Doses Orally Administered JNJ-53718678 Infants Hospitalized With Respiratory Syncytial Virus ( RSV ) Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1b , randomize ( study medication assign participant chance ) , partially double-blind ( neither physician participant know identity assign treatment ) , placebo-controlled , multicenter , multiple ascend dose study JNJ 53718678 infant ( great [ &gt; ] 1 month less equal [ &lt; = ] 24 month age ) hospitalize RSV infection . The duration study approximately 4 week participant exclude screening period . In Part 1 study , minimum total number 42 participant divide 3 cohort : Age group 1 ( Cohorts 1a-1e ) ( great equal [ &gt; = ] 6 month less equal [ &lt; = ] 24 month age ) , Age group 2 ( Cohorts 2a-2e ) ( &gt; =3 month less [ &lt; ] 6 month age ) Age group 3 ( Cohorts 3a-3e ) ( great [ &gt; ] 1 month &lt; 3 month age ) . Each age group consist minimum 3 cohort possibility add 2 per age group ( Cohorts e ) different dos and/or dose regimen evaluate . Each cohort consist 5 participant ( 4 participant receive JNJ-53718678 1 participant receive placebo 7 day ) , except first cohort age group contain 4 participant ( 4 participant receive JNJ 53718678 ) . In Part 2 study , age group include single cohort , Cohort f , select dose regimen determine Part 1 study use 3 age group . A minimum approximately 18 ( 12 participant receive JNJ 53718678 6 participant receive placebo ) maximum 24 participant ( 16 participant receive JNJ 53718678 8 participant receive placebo ) include part study . Pharmacokinetics safety JNJ-53718678 evaluate primarily . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>
