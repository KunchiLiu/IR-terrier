	<brief_summary>In many large trial , reduce low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) level rosuvastatin decrease incidence major cardiovascular events，but little attention effect rosuvastatin HDL level，especially HDL subtype . Epidemiological evidence strongly favor notion risk cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) inversely related plasma high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) cholesterol concentration . HDL subdivide large-sized ( HDL2a , HDL2b ) small-sized subclass ( preb1-HDL , HDL3c , HDL3b , HDL3a ) preb2-HDL . Some study indicate large HDL2a HDL2b particle make HDLs posse anti-atherogenic function . The investigator assume rosuvastatin could play role anti-atherosclerosis though level HDL2a、HDL2b increase .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effect Rosuvastatin Therapy HDL2 Level</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elevated LDL-C lower HDL-C important risk factor cardiovascular disease . Raising HDL-C attractive approach reduce residual risk cardiovascular event persist many patient receive low-density LDL-C -lowering therapy statin . From previous study , conclude compare atorvastatin , rosuvastatin could significantly increase HDL-C level baseline . However , benefit elevate HDL-C bring patient receive statin low LDL-C therapy still unknown . Despite strong evidence HDL-C level predict atherosclerotic event , attempt use HDL-based treatment strategy therapeutic target yet successful present time . However , basis enormous amount basic scientific clinical investigation , International Atherosclerosis Society US National Lipid Association still believe considerable number reason support need continue investigate therapeutic effect modulate HDL structure function . It long know low level HDL cholesterol powerful independent predictor increase cardiovascular risk , even among patient LDL cholesterol level 70 mg/dl . In fact , 1 mg/dl ( 0.026 mM ) increment HDL-C level associate significant decrease risk coronary heart disease ( CAD ) 2 % men 3 % woman . HDL-C propose several anti-atherosclerotic property , include ability mediate reverse cholesterol transport ( RCT ) , antioxidant capacity , anti-inflammatory property , nitric oxide-promoting activity , ability transport proteins intrinsic biological activity . RCT describe metabolism important antiatherogenic function HDL , namely , HDL-mediated efflux cholesterol cell arterial wall subsequent delivery liver steroidogenic organ , thus prevent atherosclerosis . HDL particles responsible RCT , critical acceptor cholesterol lipid-laden macrophage thereby play important role maintenance net cholesterol balance arterial wall reduction pro-inflammatory response lipid-rich macrophage . The antiatherogenic property HDL primarily ascribe RCT . Khera et al . recently report HDL efflux capacity inversely significantly correlate carotid intima-media thickness ( CIMT ) . A one-standard deviation increase HDL efflux capacity predict 30 % reduction odds CAD . Although cholesterol efflux macrophages represent small portion total RCT , cholesterol efflux macrophage foam cell probably relevant step respect prevent reverse atherosclerosis . HDL separate two major part , i.e. , pre β- ( distinguish preβ1- , preβ2- , preβ3-HDL ) a-HDL ( separated 5 distinct subclass HDL3c 3b 3a 2a 2b ) . It postulate RCT indeed metabolic process nascent preβ-HDL converted mature a-HDL , follow route preβ1-HDL→preβ2-HDL→preβ3-HDL→HDL3→HDL2 [ 13 ] . The effect HDL-C plaque formation complex , since HDL particles highly heterogeneous , exist spectrum small , intermediate large particle differ lipid protein content . So increase plasma HDL-C necessarily reflect increase reverse cholesterol transport ( RCT ) . Former study cholesteryl ester transfer protein ( CETP ) modulators inhibitor dalcetrapib limit efficacy still way may attribute concentration raise total HDL-C level undesirable side effect . Results obtain study , show HDL quality ( HDL subpopulation ) , rather quantity ( total HDL concentration ) , target future pharmacological therapy . A number investigation report , increase plasma LDL-C decrease plasma HDL-C concentration elevate TC ( total cholesterol ) , CAD patient hyperlipidemia , patient CAD diabetes , general shift toward smaller-sized HDL ( HDL3 ) , , turn , indicate reverse cholesterol transport might weaken HDL maturation might abnormal . Significantly low larger-sized HDL-HDL2 CAD patient hyperlipidemia compare control patient , inverse relationship HDL-C , HDL2 , CAD particularly strong men type 2 diabetes mellitus . In type 2 diabetes patient , difference HDL2 myocardial infarction ( MI ) non-MI group persist adjustment physical activity , alcohol intake , obesity , duration diabetes , glycemic control . Moreover , HDL2 deficiency also demonstrate primary alteration myocardial infarction patient even without significant risk factor . The tendency small-sized HDL3b , HDL3a level significantly high , large-sized HDL2a HDL2b level significantly low also detect ACS ( acute coronary syndrome ) patient . From article Chinese patient elevate TC LDL-C/HDL-C ratio , also general shift toward smaller-sized HDL particle , implied maturation process HDL block . Overall , accumulate evidence demonstrate patient CAD/CAD comorbid diabetes/elevated TC level , HDL maturation hamper stage transformation small-sized HDL3 large size HDL2 . HDL2 level inverse association risk acute myocardial infarction thus protective factor ischemic heart disease . It also demonstrate patient high HDL2 level well protect atherosclerosis . It demonstrate atorvastatin 20 mg/d treatment 8 week could result favorable modification HDL subfraction phenotype . Treated atorvastatin 20mg/d significantly increase cholesterol concentration large HDL particle decrease cholesterol concentration small HDL particle although without change serum HDL-C level patient atherosclerosis . However , still lack evidence effect rosuvastatin treatment HDL maturation ( step transformation HDL3 HDL2 ) RCT process CAD Chinese patient . It demonstrate Low HDL cholesterol frequently associate low HDL2b high HDL cholesterol frequently associate high HDL2b . As investigator discuss , compare atorvastatin , rosuvastatin could significantly decrease LDL-C level increase HDL-C level baseline . So besides basic effect low LDL-C , strong possibility rosuvastatin therapy CAD patient hyperlipidemia could reverse aberrant HDL maturation process via elevate lager HDL2 level , restore RCT process normal prevent atherosclerosis .</detailed_description>
