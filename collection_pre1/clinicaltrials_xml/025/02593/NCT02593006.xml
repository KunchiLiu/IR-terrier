	<detailed_description>STOP-JIA prospective , observational study compare clinical effectiveness impact patient report outcomes 3 different treatment strategy ( CTPs ) new onset pJIA patient answer critical question start biologic medication . All participant enrol CARRA Registry start one CTPs , decide treat physician patient/caregiver . Subjects enrol one 60 participate CARRA site across US Canada . Total anticipated enrollment &gt; 400 , 200 patient per year 2 year recruitment . Specific Aim 1 : To compare clinical effectiveness different strategy ( CTPs ) use biologic medication achieve clinically inactive disease ( CID ) 12 month new-onset pJIA . Three common strategy differ time biologic medication introduction compare : 1 ) Step-Up : disease modify anti-rheumatic drug ( DMARD ) monotherapy step addition biologic medication need ; 2 ) Early Combination : DMARD plus biologic medication treatment onset ; 3 ) Biologic First : biologic medication monotherapy treatment onset . Hypothesis 1 : A significantly high proportion child start biologic medication onset ( CTP 2 3 ) achieve CID 12 month therapy compare standard therapy ( CTP 1 ) . Specific Aim 2 : To compare patient caregiver report outcomes different strategy . Hypothesis 2 : There statistically significant difference patient/caregiver report outcome ( PROs ) treatment strategy inform future patient provider select optimal treatment . The CARRA Registry house CARRA 's clinical data coordinate center , Duke Clinical Research Institute ( DCRI ) . The CARRA Registry Protocol document CARRA Registry fulfill PCOR standard registry . STOP-JIA utilize data collection , storage , management process , system requirement , security process already establish CARRA Registry DCRI . STOP-JIA use Web-based electronic CRFs ( eCRFs ) develop CARRA Registry already familiar site personnel . The eCRF platform , RAVE , 21CFR part11 compliant meet regulatory requirement . Database Web server secure firewall controlled physical access . eCRFs monitor completeness , accuracy , attention detail throughout study DCRI data site management team use process develop CARRA Registry consistent DCRI 's internal SOPs . Use electronic data capture allow immediate prompts/queries enter value expect range incomplete data field . The design data collection instrument allow center record plan assessment patient miss enter know reason assessment miss . DCRI regularly provide report detail data completion metric site . Stakeholder engagement also important aspect study , patients/caregivers well stakeholder serve research partner advisor study .</detailed_description>
