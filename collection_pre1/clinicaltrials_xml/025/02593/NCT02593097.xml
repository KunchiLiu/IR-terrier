	<brief_summary>Migraine third prevalent disease world . Preventive treatment indicate 40 % individual episodic migraine . Although 4 treatment approve US Food Drug Administration prevention episodic migraine , none design prevent migraine , efficacy modest , significant adverse-event profile . As result , less 1/3 migraine sufferer candidate prevention receive drug treatment treat , 85 % discontinue preventive drug within one year . Migraine pain associate activation sensitization specific receptor involve pain-promoting pathway . Metformin , widely available , well-tolerated anti-diabetic medication , downregulate pain-promoting pathway . Metformin demonstrate positive result animal model migraine laboratory . Given longstanding use establish safety record metformin , investigator evaluate safety efficacy metformin preventive treatment high-frequency episodic migraine randomize , double-blind , placebo-controlled , crossover trial .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metformin Prevention Episodic Migraine ( MPEM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator obtain approval Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board , patient provide write , inform consent study enrollment . This single-center , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , crossover study . The investigator enroll 40 subject . Subjects recruit outpatient Mayo Headache Clinic , Mayo Women 's Health Clinic , Mayo Community Internal Medicine , Mayo Clinic- Arizona State University Neurology Clinic . The Headache Clinic employ 6 headache specialist 1 fellow sufficient staff support study recruitment patient high-frequency episodic migraine within 6 month . Inclusion criterion follow : 1 ) age 18-65 year , 2 ) diagnosis migraine without aura &gt; 1 year accord International Classification Headache Disorders-IIIb ( 2013 ) , 3 ) 5-14 migraine day per month average precede 3 month . Women reproductive ability must use reliable form contraception begin 3 month study enrollment , throughout study , least 1 month study completion . Exclusion criterion follow : 1 ) diagnosis diabetes mellitus polycystic ovarian syndrome , 2 ) overuse acute migraine treatment , 3 ) failure respond 3 previous preventive drug treatment , 4 ) change dose migraine-preventive medication within 2 month begin baseline diary phase , 5 ) significant somatic psychiatric disease , 6 ) know alcohol substance abuse , 7 ) pregnant breastfeed . Before study enrollment , patient undergo 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test confirm absence diabetes mellitus . Subjects keep headache diary 4 week establish baseline characteristic , include number migraine day per month , number moderate severe headache day per month , number day per month acute medication use . The 4-week baseline period follow 2 treatment period 12 week , separate washout period 4 week ( total study duration , 32 week ) . For 12-week treatment period , subject receive either metformin 500mg twice daily match placebo twice daily . A statistician create randomize treatment allocation schedule use computerized random number generator . The randomized treatment allocation schedule store use REDCap randomization module . The Mayo Clinic Pharmacy allocate patient metformin-placebo sequence placebo-metformin sequence 1:1 ratio . Subjects 7 study visit . Routine laboratory study pregnancy test perform enrollment week 20 . Abnormal kidney liver function exclude subject . Pregnancy exclude subject . General neurologic examination perform 3 7 visit . At visit , subject receive medication period next visit . A headache diary use trial . For every day subject headache type , record headache characteristic , associate feature , medication use . The primary end point number migraine day per month treatment metformin v placebo . The secondary end point percentage patient &gt; 50 % reduction migraine day per month ( response rate ) . Adverse event record . Mean 4-week migraine frequency patient receive metformin v placebo treatment assess use Hills-Armitage method . Response rate assess use McNemar test . The statistician create Web-based case report form use REDCap . Study coordinator record data use REDCap form . If crossover study demonstrate metformin effective well-tolerated medication patient high frequency episodic migraine , serve pilot data large double-blind , randomize , control study . These study present new , safe , well-tolerated therapeutic option patient high frequency episodic migraine , also elucidate neurobiology migraine . If AMPK confirm novel target migraine treatment , drug discovery could identify more-powerful safe activator AMPK improve efficacy tolerability .</detailed_description>
