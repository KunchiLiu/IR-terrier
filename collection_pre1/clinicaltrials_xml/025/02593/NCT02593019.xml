	<brief_summary>AZD1775 ( previously know MK-1775 early study ) inhibitor Wee1 , protein tyrosine kinase . Wee1 phosphorylates inhibits cyclin-dependent kinase 1 ( CDK1 ) 2 ( CDK2 ) , involve regulation intra-S G2 cell cycle checkpoint . CDK1 ( also call cell division cycle 2 , CDC2 ) activity drive cell G2 phase cell cycle mitosis . In response DNA damage , Wee1 inhibit CDK1 prevent cell divide damage DNA repair ( G2 checkpoint arrest ) . Inhibition Wee1 expect release tumor cell chemotherapeutically-induced arrest cell replication . In vitro experiment demonstrate AZD1775 synergistic cytotoxic effect administer combination various DNA damaging agent divergent mechanisms action . Therefore , primary objective clinical development AZD1775 use chemosensitizing drug combination cytotoxic agent ( combination agent ) treatment advance solid tumor . CDK2 activity drive cell , , S-phase cell cycle genome duplicate preparation cell division . Inhibition Wee1 expect cause aberrantly high CDK2 activity S-phase cell , turn , lead unstable DNA replication structure ultimately DNA damage . Therefore , anticipate AZD1775 independent anti-tumor activity absence add chemotherapy . The tumor suppressor protein p53 regulate G1 checkpoint . As majority human cancer harbor abnormality pathway become dependent S- G2- phase checkpoint . Thus , S- G2-checkpoint abrogation cause inhibition Wee1 may selectively sensitize p53-deficient cell . One hundred percent Small cell lung cancer TP53 mutation , therefore expect Small cell lung cancer lose G1 checkpoint high probability WEE1 dependency proper DNA repair cell cycle progression . For reason , Small cell lung cancer could good clinical trial target disease WEE1 inhibitor .</brief_summary>
