	<brief_summary>The next generation personalize medical treatment accord type personal genetic information evolve rapidly . The genome analysis need systematic infra database base personal genetic information . Therefore , big data genome-clinical information important . To determine feasibility use tumor 's molecular profiling targeted therapy treatment advance cancer determine clinical outcome ( Response rate , PFS , duration response overall survival ) patient advanced cancer , investigator go take tumor tissue patient process molecular profile receive molecular profile direct treatment .</brief_summary>
