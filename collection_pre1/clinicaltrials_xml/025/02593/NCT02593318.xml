	<brief_title>Trial Oxaloacetate Alzheimer 's Disease ( TOAD )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) progressive brain disorder cause memory think problem . The exact cause AD unknown . Researchers believe mitochondrion ( part cell produce energy ) might link symptom AD . Some study show brain patient Alzheimer 's disease reduce mitochondrial activity , few mitochondrion present nerve cell , reduce ability utilize glucose ( sugar ) energy . Oxaloacetate ( OAA ) natural chemical show effect brain mitochondrial activity brain energy non-human animal . This study divide two part . In first part study , researcher test whether dose 1 gram per day OAA , take approximately 4 week 15 people AD safe tolerable . After 15 participant part 1 complete participation , determine study drug safe dose , second part study begin . In part 2 , researcher test dose 2 gram per day OAA , take approximately 4 week 15 people AD , assess safety dose . Participants study 10 week .</detailed_description>
