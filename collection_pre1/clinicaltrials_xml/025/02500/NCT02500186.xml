	<brief_title>The Clinical Study Assess Effect Amount Carbohydrate Intake Meals Differing Glycemic Index ( GI ) Patients Treated With Sodium-dependent Glucose Cotransporter 2 ( SGLT2 ) Inhibitor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>&lt; Background Rationale &gt; In order decrease risk hypoglycemia cause SGLT2 inhibitor , necessary review effect volume carbohydrate intake level GI value variation blood glucose . Also , patient chronic lack carbohydrate intake receive SGLT2 inhibitor , risk serious hypoglycemic reaction . Thus , establishment proper meal patient receive SGLT2 inhibitor urgent task . The objective study establish safe dietary therapy patient type 2 diabetes mellitus avoid hypoglycemia control carbohydrate intake volume GI value , study patient provide study meal three time day circadian blood glucose variation include blood glucose meal measure use CGM . In addition , blood urine sample collect future research ( metabolome analysis ) effect carbohydrate intake volume GI value metabolism conduct extend study study . &lt; Study Procedures &gt; Total 24 study patient type 2 diabetes mellitus take washed hypoglycemic drug ( oral hypoglycemic drug glucagon like peptide-1 receptor agonist ) least 4 week randomize 3 group ( 8 patient ) high GI meal contain 55 % carbohydrate group , low GI meal contain 55 % carbohydrate group , high GI meal contain 40 % carbohydrate group . The energy intake study patient group 1800 kcal per day . Each study group patient take follow diet 14 day ; study patient high GI meal contain 55 % carbohydrate group take 55 % carbohydrate white rice diet ; low GI meal contain 55 % carbohydrate group take 55 % carbohydrate brown rice diet ; high GI meal contain 40 % carbohydrate group take 40 % carbohydrate white rice diet . Study patient orally receive luseogliflozin 2.5 mg s.i.d . breakfast 7 day 8th day start study meal 14th day . Planned examination conduct initiation study meal , initiation study treatment , completion clinical study . Blood glucose measure 4 day 3rd day initiation study meal pre-dose study treatment 2 day study treatment completion next day study treatment blood glucose data continuous 48 hour one time obtain . &lt; Time process get informed consent &gt; Principal investigator sub-investigator fully explain clinical study candidate patient use informed consent form approve Institutional Review Board prior study procedure obtains write informed consent subject voluntary basis confirm patient duly understand content clinical study . Principal investigator sub-investigator give explanation patient study patient affix name seal give signature enter date inform consent form . If study collaborator give supplementary explanation , collaborator also affixes name seal give signature enter date . Principal investigator sub-investigator provide copy informed consent form study patient give inform consent participate clinical study record . Principal investigator sub-investigator document date inform consent case report form . &lt; Screening Examination &gt; The eligibility clinical study candidate patient give write informed consent judge follow examination . Candidate patient undergo screen examination 28 day one day initiation test meal ( patient take one hypoglycemic drug , 28 day one day initiation washout ) . Demographic background : date birth , race , sex , disease duration type 2 diabetes mellitus , drug therapy use treatment type 2 diabetes mellitus within 3 month prior study procedure , complication / medical history , concomitant drug / therapy , drink / smoking status , height / weight / BMI Examination item : physical examination , measurement body fluid volume ( impedance method ) , clinical laboratory test , vital sign ( blood pressure , pulse rate , body temperature ) &lt; Statistical Analysis &gt; 1 . Demographic Other Baseline Characteristics Efficacy analysis set Safety analysis set use analysis . For discrete value , frequency summarize group ; continuous data , summary statistic calculate . Comparison group also conduct . 2 . Analysis primary endpoint ( Efficacy endpoint ) Efficacy analysis set use analysis . Summary statistic blood glucose level use CGM calculate . Comparison group also conduct . 3 . Analysis Secondary endpoint ( Safety endpoint efficacy endpoint ) Safety analysis set Efficacy analysis set use analysis following summarize analyzed . For discrete value clinical laboratory test vital sign , frequency summarize group ; continuous data , summary statistic calculate group . Summary statistic adverse event calculate group . 4 . Significance level test confidence coefficient confidence interval Tests two-sided significance level 5 % . Confidence interval estimate coefficient 95 % . &lt; Sample size &gt; Determination sample size 24 patient ( 8 group ) The sample size 8 patient group size operable appropriate analysis study . &lt; Action take study patient adverse event occur &gt; If adverse event observe , principal investigator sub-investigator provide treatment follow-up study patient patient recovers adverse event follow-up judge unneccesary medically explainable reason . If follow-up examination , additional examination , re-examination necessary , conduct obtain study patient 's informed consent . Principal investigator sub-investigator document name adverse event , date occurrence , intensity , seriousness , study drug adjustment , treatment adverse event , outcome , date outcome , relationship clinical study . For adverse event observe initiation study drug administration follow-up examination , relationship study drug also document .</detailed_description>
