	<brief_summary>The main objective study evaluate efficacy SRP-4045 SRP-4053 compare placebo Duchenne muscular dystrophy ( DMD ) patient out-of-frame deletion mutation amenable skip exon 45 exon 53 respectively . Additional objective include evaluation safety , pharmacokinetics biomarkers .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This double-blind , placebo-controlled , multi-center study evaluate efficacy safety SRP-4045 SRP-4053 . Eligible patient out-of-frame deletion mutation amenable exon 45 53 skip randomize receive weekly intravenous ( IV ) infusions 30 mg/kg SRP-4045 30 mg/kg SRP-4053 respectively ( combined-active group , 66 patient ) placebo ( 33 patient ) 96 week ( placebo-controlled period trial ) . This follow open label extension period patient receive open-label active treatment 96 week . The study enroll approximately 99 patient , plan minimum target 45 patient amenable exon 45 skip 45 patient amenable exon 53 skipping . Approximately 66 patient randomized receive active treatment either SRP-4045 SRP-4053 ( depend deletion mutation ) , 33 patient randomized receive placebo . Twice many patient receive active treatment receive placebo ( 2:1 randomization ) . When approximately 75 patient trial 48 week group independent expert review key study result make determination whether patient roll open-label period study receive active drug continue placebo-controlled period Week 96 plan . Clinical efficacy assess regularly schedule study visit , include functional test six-minute walk test ( 6MWT ) . All patient undergo muscle biopsy baseline second muscle biopsy Week 48 . Safety assess collection adverse event ( AEs ) , laboratory test , electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , echocardiogram ( ECHOs ) , vital sign , physical examination throughout study . Blood sample take periodically throughout study ass pharmacokinetics drug .</detailed_description>
