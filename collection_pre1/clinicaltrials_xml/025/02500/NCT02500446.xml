	<brief_summary>Several study suggest despite suppressive combination antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) people HIV-positive , individual may on-going viral replication . Clarifying extent on-going viral replication ART important development HIV-1 curative strategy reduce HIV-1 associate immune activation . The investigator hypothesize treatment intensification dolutegravir inhibit residual virus replication HIV-1 infect patient ART . The primary objective study determine effect dolutegravir intensification residual virus replication circulate cluster differentiation 4 ( CD4+ ) T cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dolutegravir Impact Residual Replication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ART effectively suppress HIV-1 viremia patient , virus rebound within 2-3 week stop ART . ART unable cure HIV due persistence virus long-lived latently infected cell , residual virus replication anatomical reservoir . Understanding contribution residual virus replication virus persistence ART important first , intervention aim eliminate latency effective presence residual virus replication ; second , residual virus replication may contribute persist immune activation associate all-cause mortality . Numerous study demonstrate intensify suppressive ART regimen additional antiretroviral drug alter frequency latently infected cell low-level viremia . However , study intensify ART integrase inhibitor raltegravir , increase circularise HIV episome contain 2 copy viral long terminal repeat ( 2-LTR ) circle within 2 week intensification , observe ~30 % study participant . 2-LTR circle short half- life , may explain increase 2-LTR circle observe study measure 2-LTR circle within 2 week raltegravir intensification . In two randomized control trial , level 2-LTR circle increase transiently patient randomized intensification raltegravir compare placebo effect pronounce subject receive protease inhibitor ( PI ) -containing ART regimen . Other study fail demonstrate increase 2-LTR circle follow raltegravir intensification likely sample delay beyond 2 week . One possible explanation additional effect observe raltegravir intensification extensive penetration compound gastrointestinal ( GI ) tissue reach concentration 39- 650-fold high plasma . To date , raltegravir integrase inhibitor investigate ART intensification trial . Dolutegravir ( DTG ) recently license once-daily integrase inhibitor non-inferior raltegravir similar safety profile , however DTG level GI tissue 17 % plasma . DTG investigate intensification study , whether add dolutegravir suppressive ART regimen able inhibit residual replication currently unknown . Thus , several unresolved issue relate residual viral replication presence ART potential benefit integrase inhibitor context : How frequent phenomenon occur frequently patient receive PI-containing regimen ? Given raltegravir seem impact residual replication approximate 30 % HIV infect patient ART assess early intensification , effect DTG setting ? Finally , dynamic 2-LTR level blood early phase intensification integrase inhibitor ? To address question , investigator design randomize , control study compare impact intensification DTG placebo HIV-infected patient suppressive ART . In study , investigator closely define effect dolutegravir intensification 2-LTR level circulate CD4+ T cell . Study participant study 133 day . The duration participation calculate initial screen visit last study visit ( visit 9 ) , 9 visit total .</detailed_description>
