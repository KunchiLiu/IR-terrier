	<brief_title>Air Stacking v Glossopharyngeal Breathing Neuromuscular Diseases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In neuromuscular disease ( NMD ) , progressive weakness respiratory muscle cause change cough mechanism prevents elimination secretion , main cause morbidity mortality population . Improving cough response achieve effective secretion elimination require increase lung volume optimize peak cough flow ( PCF ) . It show high PCF decrease respiratory complication NMD . Vital capacity ( VC ) maximum insufflation capacity ( MIC ) important factor increase PCF , consequently , obtain effective cough ; thus , optimize lung volume achieve adequate cough flow important effective bronchial hygiene . Currently , manual technique use increase MIC achieve effective PCF . The important manual technique use improve MIC , consequently PCF , air stack ( AS ) glossopharyngeal breathing ( GPB ) . These advantage low cost , patient autonomy relative ease learning compare technique use electromechanical device ( e.g. , volumetric ventilator mechanical cough assist device ) , whose main disadvantage high cost complexity use . AS involves deliver multiple breath manual resuscitation bag hold insufflation volume momentary closure glottis , repeat MIC reach . GPB use glossopharyngeal muscle successively introduce small amount air lung induce cough assist weak inspiratory muscle . These technique useful treat different NMD , Spinal Muscular Atrophy ( SMA ) Type II , Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy ( DMD ) Spinal Cord Injury ( SCI ) . The aim study compare effect two low-cost technique , AS GPB , MIC child adolescent NMD . The hypothesis investigation although technique effective , use AS result high MIC GPB .</detailed_description>
