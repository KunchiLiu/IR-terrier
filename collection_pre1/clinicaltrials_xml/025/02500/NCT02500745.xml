	<brief_summary>After obtain consent , bed side cardiac ultrasonography perform case undergo transesophageal echocardiography evaluate correlation leave atrium volume leave atrial appendage flow velocity predict thrombosis risk .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Left Atrial Volume Index Left Atrial Appendage Flow Velocities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Informed consent obtain prior research related procedure Prior perform transesophageal echocardiography , 4 2-chamber transthoracic image obtain perform standard leave atrial volumetric assessment well speckle track interrogation . Both procedure perform offline . The transesophageal echocardiography perform use available equipment 5- 7-megaHertz multiplane transducer accord standard care . All image acquire per American Society Echocardiography guideline record analysis . The left atrial appendage best visualized 60 , 90 110 degree image plane leave atrial appendage contraction velocity record place pulse wave Doppler sample volume inside proximal third leave atrial appendage angle . In addition , image record use 3-beat cycle capture later perform offline velocity vector image analysis leave atrial appendage speckle track analysis . The transthoracic echocardiography perform transesophageal echocardiography examination use 2- 4-megaHertz transducer accord standard practice guideline . The following echocardiographic variable prospectively measure calculate : left ventricle ejection fraction use Simpson method , leave atrial volume measure use biplane method leave atrium volume index calculate base body surface area . Tissue Doppler image mitral valve annulus measure Pulsed wave Doppler mitral inflow velocity . Study include follow . Study duration 24 month</detailed_description>
