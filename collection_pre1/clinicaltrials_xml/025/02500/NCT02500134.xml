	<detailed_description>The limbus locate cornea conjunctiva tissue , approximately 1.5 mm wide adult human eye , important provide barrier frontier prevent conjunctival tissue invasion cornea , contain nerve pass cornea , blood lymph vasculature oxygen nutrient delivery , also niche environment limbal stem cell . The human limbus contains radially orient fibrovascular ride name palisade Vogt ( POV ) , unique tissue first note 1866 describe detail 1921 . The POV unique structure , configuration dimension commonly find type epithelial stem cell niche body , include complicate niche area provide safe place protect stem cell damage injury . During past year , progress stem cell research cell therapy focus attention POV location stem cell keep corneal epithelial homeostasis clarity . The POV also provide niche environment limbal stem cell . The niche cell surround limbal stem cell , stromal environment underneath limbal epithelial cell , blood vessel nerve innervation around limbal epithelium help create unique niche environment limabl stem cell . Understanding limbal structure , especially POV , necessary treatment limbal damage development stem cell therapy target restore impaired function limbal stem cell . So far , vivo image system able visualize identify limbal stem cell directly . One alternative practical visualize histological morphology POV , speculate possible status stem cell accordingly . However , microstructure POV well define understood spite awareness 's importance . Slit-lamp biomicroscope use routinely clinical examination limbal morphology . However , technology allow high resolution image structural detail 20 % patient identify . In vivo confocal microscopy use visualize POV provide cellular level resolution image , technique limit high magnification restrict area scan . In addition , vivo confocal microscopy require direct contact eye . Although quality image impressive , disadvantage exist include direct contact examination , small field view ( ~200μm x 200μm ) , limited axial resolution . Besides , slit lamp biomicroscopy vivo confocal microscopy limitation able give overall view dimension structure whole palisades region . Optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) image modality allow non-invasive image morphology biological tissue micrometer scale resolution image depths 1-2mm tissue surface . During year , OCT become useful clinical research tool image ocular surface . In addition mostly use application observe optic disc retinal choroidial structure , usage anterior segment , especially cornea , also widely develop . An anterior segment OCT ( Visante ; Carl Zeiss Meditec , Dublin , CA ) , time-domain OCT , commercial available OCT design especially anterior segment . This OCT instrument use widely LASIK , different lamellar keratoplasty , keratoconus screen evaluation corneal diseases different layer . However , limited resolution allow observation epithelial layer ocular surface . Spectral domain OCT corneal module provide much good resolution time domain OCT observation epithelial layer ocular surface . It use recently evaluate corneal epithelial layer reliable result . In study , use fourier-domain optical coherence tomography OCT ( RTvue , Optovue Inc. , Fremont , CA ) , corneal-anterior module long lens adapter low magnification , observe limbal structure ( POV ) . The purpose study assess role age region limbus .</detailed_description>
