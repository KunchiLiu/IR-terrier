	<brief_title>Prevention Syncope Trial 6 - Atomoxetine Vasovagal Syncope</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Syncope affect 50 % Canadians , cause 1-2 % emergency room visit , probably responsible C $ 250 million ( Canadian dollar ) health care spending year . It associate decreased quality life , trauma , loss employment , limitation daily activity . The common cause vasovagal syncope . This occur people age , lifelong predilection . While median number faint population 2 , come investigator ' care median 10-15 lifetime spell , increase frequency year presentation . Vasovagal syncope due abrupt hypotension transient bradycardia , cause cerebral hypoperfusion . The pathophysiology may either failure venous return progressive vasodilation , due inappropriately low sympathetic outflow . There known medical treatment frequent fainting . The investigator perform pivotal Canadian Institutes Health Research ( CIHR ) -funded randomize trial show neither permanent pacing , beta blocker , fludrocortisone help majority patient . However 2 randomized study suggest inhibition norepinephrine transport ( NET ) reuptake sibutramine reboxetine ( NET inhibitor ) prevents syncope tilt test 80 % , investigator report sibutramine markedly reduced frequency vasovagal syncope 7 symptomatic patient . Sibutramine reboxetine , different reason , available Canada . However atomoxetine available use help patient attention deficit disorder . There data pertain hemodynamic effect patient vasovagal syncope . Although randomized clinical trial atomoxetine prevention vasovagal syncope would need clinical use , proof principle study need first . Objective : To determine atomoxetine 40 mg bid patient ≥18 year old recurrent vasovagal syncope well prevent syncope tilt test placebo . Methods : The investigator conduct prospective , randomize , parallel , double-blind , proof-of-concept study test hypothesis norepinephrine transporter inhibition Atomoxetine prevent tilt-induced vasovagal syncope ( VVS ) /pre-syncope patient clinical vasovagal syncope . Subjects ≥1 faint previous year , diagnosis vasovagal syncope base Calgary Syncope Symptom Score . The primary outcome measure time syncope presyncope trough rate-pressure product &lt; 7000 mm Hg/min . The primary analysis perform intention-to-treat basis . Secondary analysis include modelled estimation systemic vascular resistance stroke volume , base arterial waveform blood pressure . This permit u address whether NET inhibition prevents vasovagal reflex maintenance cardiac preload maintenance systemic vascular resistance . The investigator randomize 64 patient double blind acute phase 2 study either Atomoxetine 40mg PO BID x 2 dos match placebo . A sample size 56 syncope patient would 85 % power detect 60 % relative risk reduction placebo outcome rate 65 % , use unmatched 2-tailed test alpha=0.05 . To compensate report dropout rate inflate sample 15 % 64 subject . A formal , blind mid-way safety efficacy analysis perform p &lt; 0.01 stop rule efficacy . The sample size inflate 74 account spending power interim analysis . This provide 85 % power detect 80 % relative risk reduction . Relevance : This first adequately power study ability atomoxetine prevent vasovagal reflex . It also provide insight whether norepinephrine transport inhibition function maintain venous return increase systemic vascular resistance . If positive , study provide strong biomedical rationale preliminary clinical result lead randomized clinical trial atomoxetine prevention vasovagal syncope .</detailed_description>
