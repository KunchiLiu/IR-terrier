	<brief_title>Feasibility Testing Pilot Study V-MOTIVE Protocol Software Version 1</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators conduct within-subject pilot study 6 tutor 6 child answer research question V-Motive 's ability perform intend function . The goal evaluate feasibility , usability , potential V-Motive deliver comprehensive , individualized video modeling integrate child 's program . Investigators also use descriptive statistic provide preliminary insight potential impact system child 's performance ABA therapy . However , data NOT intend show cause show effectiveness . The study answer follow question : 1 ) 3 ) Can V-Motive feasibly use ABA therapy positively impact child 's performance within 4 week ? 2 ) How laborious construct fully-indexed video repository therapy footage use V-Motive ? 3 ) How accurate system suggest cue appropriate video playback demand ?</detailed_description>
