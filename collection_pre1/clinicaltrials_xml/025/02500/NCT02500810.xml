	<brief_title>Monosialoganglioside Preventing Neurotoxicity Induced Albumin-bound Paclitaxel Chemotherapy Lung Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lung cancer patient receive single-agent albumin-bound paclitaxel chemotherapy include trial . Patients randomly assign experimental group blank control group base segment block randomize method . After enrollment , patient complete least chemotherapy GM1 injection/blank control . During 3w per cycle chemotherapy , albumin-bound paclitaxel conduct D1 D8 , GM1 ( 40mg+250ml N.S ) inject D1 D8 . Neurotoxicity evaluation quality life assessment conduct every cycle 3m/6m chemotherapy .</detailed_description>
