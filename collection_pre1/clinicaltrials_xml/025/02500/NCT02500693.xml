	<brief_summary>This trial intend evaluate value circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) , combination unenhanced ( without injection contrast medium ) low dose ( limit effective radiation dose 1,5 mSv ) chest compute tomography ( LDCT ) screen Lung cancer ( LC ) . LDCT screen show reduce LC mortality smoker ex-smokers , old 55 year , history 30 pack-years . LDCT however show close 30 % rate false positive require repeat follow-up also invasive investigation , also false negative metastatic LC discover screen round . Migration circulate tumor cell ( CTC ) early event carcinogenesis characterize aggressive cancer . We recently show CTC detect ISET technique population high risk LC , i.e . COPD patient LC detectable LDCT . The study focus patient high risk lung cancer i.e . smoker ex-smokers suffer Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease ( COPD ) . The study enroll 600 participant undergo three round screen one year interval , round combine search CTC blood sample LDCT . Each participant follow least one year last screening round</brief_summary>

Many COPD patient previous chest CT examination . This become common medical practice , especially patient chronic lung disease COPD patient . Including patient would introduce huge bias study artificially focus rapidly grow cancer . Redoing CT screen intend patient recently underwent investigation would also unnecessarily enhance irradiation patient . It note NLST trial `` previous chest CT ( ≤ 18 month ) '' key exclusion criterion [ NLST Radiology 2011 ] .</criteria>
