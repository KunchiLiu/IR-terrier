	<brief_summary>The purpose current study develop well understand brain mechanism involve psychological treatment posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . This project build past research use script-driven imagery lab investigate brain activity area activate exposure trauma-related cue . This project also develop new knowledge concern volitional control area . The ultimate goal study well understand whether volitional control brain area improve therapeutic outcome . This process first pilot sample healthy control . This allow investigator refine methodology prior recruit sample PTSD .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Post-traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) characterize intense emotional distress upon exposure trauma reminder avoidance people place trigger trauma memory . Neurocircuitry model PTSD seek explain symptom heighten emotional reactivity , hypervigilance threat , avoidance suggest abnormal activity neural region involve emotional reactivity ( e.g. , amygdala ) cognitive control emotional responding ( e.g. , ventral medial prefrontal cortex , anterior cingulate cortex ) . While knowledge exist neurobiological abnormality associate PTSD , data cross-sectional nature ignore individual difference neural encode subjective aspect trauma ( e.g. , whether elicits fear vs guilt v disgust ) . Additionally , manner exist psychological treatment alter neural mechanism mediate core PTSD symptom unknown . This problematic , give state-of-the-art treatment PTSD effective ~60 % time . Here , investigator proposes utilize novel computational modeling approach combine state-of-the-art functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) -based neurofeedback directly identify modulate idiosyncratic neural network encode trauma memory . Successful pursuit aim would 1 ) provide scientific support hypothesis distribute network include amygdala , hippocampus , medial prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) , lateral PFC , anterior insula mediate emotional respond upon trauma memory recall , 2 ) provide proof-of-concept evidence neurofeedback modulation network boost exist therapy efficacy .</detailed_description>
