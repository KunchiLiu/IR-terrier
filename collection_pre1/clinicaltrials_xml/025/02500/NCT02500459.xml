	<brief_summary>Topotecan FDA-approved drug give intravenous infection . The purpose study determine treatment topotecan alternative method , direct delivery part brain tumor spread , safe well tolerate . The Cleveland Multiport Catheter new , investigational device use deliver topotecan tumor-infiltrated brain . A second purpose study determine whether Cleveland Multiport Catheter use effectively safely deliver topotecan tumor-infiltrated brain . This study also examine tumor respond treatment topotecan . This study also look way topotecan inject tumors-infiltrated brain . A small amount contrast dye ( call gadolinium DTPA ) add topotecan inject . Pictures take brain MRI machine . This allow investigator see tumor-infiltrated brain topotecan inject . This study collect medical information , , treatment order well understand hot make type procedure accessible patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Objectives - To investigate magnetic resonance ( MR ) image spatial temporal distribution topotecan tumor-infiltrated brain administer convection-enhanced delivery ( CED ) patient recurrent/progressive WHO grade III IV ( high grade ) glioma ( HGG ) fail standard therapy comprise surgical biopsy and/or resection adjuvant chemotherapy radiotherapy , follow clinically-indicated resection contrast enhance tumor mass . - To investigate MR image influence catheter positioning , spatial temporal distribution topotecan administer CED patient recurrent/progressive HGG - To evaluate extent spatial distribution topotecan , MR imaging , deliver non-enhancing tumor tissue ( define pre-operative conventional MRI imaging without intravenous gadolinium ) intraoperative setting , immediate peri-operative setting , post-operative setting . Secondary Objectives - To investigate extent CED-mediated delivery topotecan - To investigate extent infusate distribute 2 cm margin around resection cavity administration CED - To assess safety , tolerability toxicity profile topotecan administer CED use different infusion rate . - To observe evidence activity single-agent topotecan administer CED patient recurrent/progressive HGG fail standard therapy comprise surgical biopsy and/or resection adjuvant chemotherapy radiotherapy .</detailed_description>
