	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate safety , tolerance , immunogenicity MAS-1-Adjuvanted seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine ( IIV ) ( MER4101 ) hemagglutinin dose escalation compare non-adjuvanted comparator IIV standard dose ( SD ) healthy adult high dose ( HD ) IIV ambulatory elderly subject . Hypothesis : Reduced hemagglutinin ( HA ) dose IIV formulate MAS-1 adjuvant ( MER4101 ) safe , tolerable immunogenic healthy young adult 18 - 49 year age compare SD IIV optimal dose HA formulate MAS-1 adjuvant safe immunogenic adult 65 year age old compare HD IIV ( Phase 1A , know 9µg HA antigen ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Safety , Tolerance , Immunogenicity MAS-1-Adjuvanted Seasonal Inactivated Influenza Vaccine ( MER4101 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study phase IA/B randomize , double-blind , single-center , clinical trial , healthy adult ( 18-49 year old ) ambulatory elderly subject ( age 65 year old ) . Phase IA evaluate safety , tolerability hemagglutination inhibition assay ( HAI ) antibody response four escalating dos influenza hemagglutinin ( HA ) antigen fix dose water-in-oil emulsion adjuvant MAS-1 ( Mercia Adjuvant System-1 ) , compare license , unadjuvanted , standard dose ( SD ) license inactivated trivalent influenza virus vaccine ( IIV ) . Phase IB evaluate optimal dose IIV MAS-1 select phase IA ( know 9µg HA antigen ) safety , tolerability HAI antibody response ambulatory elderly subject compare high dose ( HD ) IIV . The ability SD IIV protect seasonal influenza virus infection elderly less vaccine efficacy observe healthy young adult . The propose MAS-1-adjuvanted influenza virus vaccine offer potential high seroconversion seroprotection rate , high antibody level , prolong duration protective antibody , HA antigen dose-sparing cross-protection antigenically divergent viral strain . This study determine adjuvanted vaccine formulate one reduce HA antigen dose safe . The study also determine likely induce improve HA antibody response ( HAI ) compare SD IIV healthy adult HD IIV elderly subject . This trial inform future clinical trial at-risk population old patient .</detailed_description>
