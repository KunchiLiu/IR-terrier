	<brief_title>Enzalutamide Niraparib Treatment Metastatic Castrate-Resistant Prostate Cancer ( CRPC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This multi-center trial . INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT : Each eligible subject begin treatment 28-day enzalutamide 160 mg/day lead-in cycle . If subject able tolerate lead-in enzalutamide cycle without Grade 2 Grade 2-4 drug-related toxicity , dose reduction , miss dos due toxicity , cycle 1 combine enzalutamide niraparib commence . Enzalutamide continue 160 mg daily . Niraparib dose daily start 100mg ( dose level 1 ) . Six subject enrol per dose level . If less 33 % subject experience dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) begin cycle 2 , daily dose niraparib escalate 200mg ( dose level 2 ) . If dose level 2 similarly tolerate , daily dose niraparib escalate 300mg ( dose level 3 ) . The following required laboratory value must obtain within 14 day prior registration protocol therapy : Hematopoietic : - White blood cell count ( WBC ) ≥ 1500/mm3 - Hemoglobin ( Hgb ) ≥ 9 g/dL - Platelets ≥ 150,000/µL - Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥ 1500/mm3 Renal : - Calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 40 cc/min use Cockcroft-Gault formula Hepatic : - Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × upper limit normal ( ULN ) - Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST , SGOT ) ≤ 2.5 × ULN</detailed_description>
