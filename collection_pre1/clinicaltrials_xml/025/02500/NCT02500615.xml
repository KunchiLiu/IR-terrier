	<brief_title>The Effect Electronic Cigarette ( ECIG ) Liquid Vehicles ECIG Acute Effects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Electronic cigarette ( ECIGs ) among important issue public health today due dramatic increase popularity . However , little known ECIGs , include factor may make likely use abuse . Examining factor influence nicotine yield , delivery , subjective effect ECIGs essential understanding abuse liability . Limited pre-clinical research reveal nicotine yield may influence ratio two liquid vehicle , propylene glycol ( PG ) vegetable glycerin ( VG ) , commonly find ECIG solution . Specifically , high proportion PG result great nicotine yield . However , influence PG : VG ratio nicotine delivery subjective effect associate ECIG use examine previously . The primary hypothesis high proportion PG result great nicotine delivery subjective effect profile suggestive high abuse liability ECIG user . Results project result understanding factor influence abuse liability ECIGs could inform regulation product .</detailed_description>
