	<brief_summary>Part 1 : ass safety tolerability pyrotinib define maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) pyrotinib patient Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 ( HER2 ) -positive advanced solid tumor ( metastatic breast cancer , gastric cancer , solid tumor target agent standard care ) . Part 2 : estimate overall response rate ( ORR ) patient HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer ( mBC ) HER2 mutant non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) treat RP2D ( MTD ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I Study Pyrotinib Patients With HER2-positive Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label , dose escalation study repeat dos pyrotinib patient HER2-positive advanced solid tumor , include breast cancer , gastric cancer HER2-positive solid tumor target agent standard care . A study cycle define pyrotinib administer daily orally 28 day . Part 1 trial dose escalation design enroll 3 6 patient dose group . Adverse event ( AEs ) assess monitor throughout study . Dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) assess first dose study drug day 28 first cycle treatment . If 1 AE meet dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) criteria give dose , 3 additional patient enrol dose group . If 2 DLTs determine give dose level , dose designate MTD , next low dose level may RP2D . Additional patient enrol two select dose level ( MTD next low dose level ) base preliminary safety , PK , clinical activity observe part 1 effort determine appropriate dose RP2D explore preliminary clinical benefit study patient population extension phase ( Part 2 ) study . The safety , tolerability AEs closely monitor throughout study duration , multiple blood sample designate time point collect PK evaluation . Part 2 trail consist two independent arm : arm A HER2 positive mBC arm B NSCLC document HER2 mutation investigate evaluate safety preliminary effectiveness clinical benefit pyrotinib single agent . Twenty patient arm ( patient HER2-positive mBC experience disease progression least 2 prior anti-HER2 therapy metastatic disease contain trastuzumab without pertuzumab , prior T-DM1 , lapatinib ) patient document HER2 mutation NSCLC whose diseased progressed prior therapy therapy ) enrol dose determine RP2D ( MTD ) . Patients arm treat two select dose level ( MTD next low dose level ) base preliminary safety , PK , clinical activity observe part 1 effort determine appropriate dose RP2D .</detailed_description>
