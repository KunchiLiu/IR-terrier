	<brief_title>MK-3475 With Lymphodepletion , TIL High Low Dose Interleukin-2 ( IL-2 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , randomly assign ( flip coin ) 1 2 treatment group ( treatment arm ) : - If assign Arm A , receive high-dose IL-2 . - If assign Arm B , receive low-dose IL-2 . Both study staff know dose IL-2 assign . The dose level cyclophosphamide , fludarabine , receive depend weight study doctor think best interest . The dose T-cells receive depend amount make lab . You receive fix dose pembrolizumab . Study Drug Administration : The day lead Day 1 study consider negative day . For example , day Day 0 Day -1 . Day 0 receive T-cells ( describe ) . You stay hospital receive T-cells , chemotherapy , IL-2 start Day -7 . You may stay hospital 3 week . On Days -7 -6 , receive cyclophosphamide vein 2 hour . On Days -5 -1 , receive fludarabine vein 15-30 minute . On Day 0 , receive T-cells central venous catheter ( CVC ) 15-60 minute . A CVC thin flexible tube insert body . The catheter may place vein arm large vein neck . If cell need give large vein upper chest neck , area numb anesthetic catheter put . Tylenol ( acetaminophen ) give mouth T-cell infusion decrease risk side effect . If assign Arm B , receive low dose IL-2 injection skin ( like shot ) 1 time day 14 day . Other catheter may need 1 arm give fluid , drug , extra nutrition . You sign separate consent form catheter , describe procedure risk detail . On Day 1 , assign Arm A , receive high dose IL-2 catheter 15 minute every 8-16 hour 5 day . On Day 21 ( +/- 7 day ) every 3 week , receive pembrolizumab vein 30 minute . You give standard drug vein help decrease risk side effect . You may ask study staff information drug give risk . Study Visits : Before start treatment : Within 28 day hospital stay : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 4 ½ tablespoon ) draw check type T-cells body . Every 1-2 day hospital stay , blood ( 3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . If blood test perform screen show CMV past , Days 0 3 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw check CMV . On Day 7 , blood ( 4½ tablespoon ) draw study different type T-cells active body . On Days 21 42 every 3 week ( Weeks 12 , 15 , 18 , ) : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - On Day 21 , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw test CMV . - On Days 21 42 , also tumor biopsy check status disease , doctor think safe . The type biopsy depend size location tumor . Your doctor discus . - On Days 21 42 , blood ( 4½ tablespoon ) draw study different type T-cells active body . On Day 63 every 12 week ( Weeks 21 , 33 , 45 , ) : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4½ tablespoon ) draw study different type T-cells active body . - You CT , MRI , and/or PET/CT scan . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) urine collect routine test . This routine blood urine collection also include pregnancy test , become pregnant . - On Day 63 , EKG . - You fill 2 questionnaire quality life . If doctor think need safe , tumor biopsy check status disease . - If doctor think need , photograph take skin lesion . You may tests/procedures repeated time study , doctor think need . Length Study Drug Dosing : You may receive 2 year pembrolizumab . You receive T-cells , chemotherapy , IL-2 one time ( hospitalize ) . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete follow-up visit . End-of-Treatment Visit : As soon stop take pembrolizumab : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 3 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw study different type T-cells active body . - You CT , MRI , and/or PET/CT scan . - If doctor think need , photograph take skin lesion . Follow-Up : After complete 2 year pembrolizumab , call every 3 month member study staff ask side effect . The call last 15 minute . This investigational study . Cyclophosphamide FDA approve commercially available treatment several type cancer leukemia , lymphoma , breast cancer . Fludarabine FDA approve commercially available treatment B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia . It consider investigational give cyclophosphamide fludarabine treat melanoma . High dose IL-2 FDA approve commercially available treatment metastatic melanoma type kidney cancer . If assign receive low-dose IL-2 , drug provide support company Prometheus cost . Pembrolizumab FDA approve commercially available treatment melanoma . T-cells FDA approve commercially available . This therapy currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 36 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
