	<brief_title>Testing PD-1 Inhibitor Pembrolizumab Maintenance Therapy After Initial Chemotherapy Metastatic Bladder Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>OUTLINE : This multi-center trial . Eligible subject 1:1 randomize placebo ( Control Arm A ) pembrolizumab ( Experimental Arm B ) . Stratification factor randomization : presence visceral metastatic disease ( lung , liver , bone organ vs. lymph node ) time initiation first-line chemotherapy , response first-line chemotherapy ( CR/PR vs. SD . Subjects progress placebo assess determine eligible cross unblinded treatment pembrolizumab . INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT : For Control Arm A , commercially available normal saline use placebo . No active placebo drug mixed normal saline . For Experimental Arm B , pembrolizumab ( placebo ) , 200 mg intravenous infusion ( IV ) every 3 week 12 month , progressive disease ( PD ) unacceptable toxicity . The following required laboratory value must obtain within fourteen day prior registration protocol therapy : Hematopoietic : - Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1,500 /mcL - Platelets ≥100,000 / mcL - Hemoglobin ≥8.5 g/dL Renal : - Creatinine ≤1.5x ULN OR - Measured calculated creatinine clearance ≥30 mL/min subject creatinine level &gt; 1.5x institutional ULN - GFR also use place creatinine CrCl Hepatic : - Serum total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN OR - Direct bilirubin ≤ ULN subject total bilirubin level &gt; 1.5 ULN - AST ( SGOT ) ALT ( SGPT ) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN subject liver metastases Coagulation : - International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) Prothrombin Time ( PT ) ≤1.5 X ULN . If subject anticoagulant therapy , PT PTT must within therapeutic range intend use anticoagulant .</detailed_description>
