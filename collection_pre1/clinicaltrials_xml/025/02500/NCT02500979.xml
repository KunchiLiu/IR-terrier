	<detailed_description>Potentially eligible subject Type 1 diabetes mellitus treat basal-bolus insulin regimen multiple daily injection insulin pump total daily insulin dose ≤60 U , eligible . Visit 1 approximately 3-6 week prior randomization . Given variability HbA1c C-peptide assay , re-testing HbA1c C-peptide perform within 18 day initial visit . Visit 2 approximately 2-5 week prior randomization . Subjects lispro insulin throughout study except Visit 4 Visit 5 , domicile 24 hr treatment period , switch regular insulin U-100 . Screen fail patient may re-screened inclusion study , long re-screening take place least 3 month original screening visit . If subject re-screened , he/she must continue meet inclusion/exclusion criterion . All study procedures initial Visit 1 must repeat re-screening visit .</detailed_description>
