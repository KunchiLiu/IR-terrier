	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well nivolumab without ipilimumab work treat patient sarcoma spread primary site part body remove surgery . Monoclonal antibody , nivolumab ipilimumab , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . It yet know whether nivolumab work well without ipilimumab treat patient metastatic unresectable sarcoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nivolumab With Without Ipilimumab Treating Patients With Metastatic Sarcoma That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate confirm response rate single agent nivolumab dual agent nivolumab plus ipilimumab patient locally advanced/unresectable metastatic soft tissue sarcoma . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate adverse event rate ( National Cancer Institute [ NCI ] Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events [ CTCAE ] version [ v ] 4.0 ) within treatment arm . II . To evaluate duration response , clinical benefit rate , time progression , progression-free survival , overall survival within treatment arm . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To potentially detect early signal confirm response rate within histologically define patient cohort . II . To assess potential association program cell death 1 ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) expression ( immunohistochemistry [ IHC ] ) clinical outcome , within treatment . III . To evaluate association select biomarker measure serial peripheral blood clinical efficacy , within treatment . IV . To evaluate association select biomarker measure tumor tissue clinical efficacy , within treatment . V. To evaluate association baseline tumor mutational burden neoantigen production clinical efficacy within treatment . VI . To evaluate secondary endpoint within patient cross dual agent nivolumab plus ipilimumab experience progressive disease receive single agent nivolumab . VII . To evaluate correlative science objective endpoint within patient cross dual agent nivolumab plus ipilimumab experience progressive disease receive single agent nivolumab . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : Patients receive nivolumab intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute every 2 week . Courses repeat every 42 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients progress 10 week single agent nivolumab may elect cross Arm II . ARM II : Patients receive nivolumab IV 60 minute ipilimumab IV 90 minute every 3 week 12 week . Patients receive nivolumab IV 60 minute every 2 week . Courses repeat every 42 day 2 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Patients progress image first 12 week therapy may continue treatment , discretion patient treat investigator . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
