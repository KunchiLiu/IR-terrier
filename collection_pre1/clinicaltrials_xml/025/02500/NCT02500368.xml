	<brief_title>A Dispensing Clinical Trial Study Test Silicone Hydrogel Lens Against Control Lens Over 1 Week</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The order lens wear ( test lens first , control lens second control lens first , test lens second ) select accord randomization table . Both test control lenses use daily wear modality 1 week . It anticipate study involve follow visit : Baseline ( screen dispense 1st study pair lens , visit combine ) , 1-week visit ( follow-up 1st study pair lenses dispense 2nd study pair lens ) 2-week visit ( 1 week follow-up 2nd study pair lens ) .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : A person eligible inclusion study he/she : Is least 17 year age full legal capacity volunteer Has read understood information consent letter Is willing able follow instruction maintain appointment schedule Is correctable visual acuity 20/30 better ( eye ) habitual correction assign study lens Is adapt soft contact lens wearer ( For purpose study : Current lens wear least 3 day per week , 8 hour day . ) A person exclude study he/she : Is participate concurrent clinical research study Has know active* ocular disease and/or infection Has systemic condition opinion investigator may affect study outcome variable** Is use systemic topical medication opinion investigator may affect study outcome variable Has know sensitivity diagnostic pharmaceutical use study Is pregnant , lactate plan pregnancy time enrolment ( verbal confirmation screen visit ) . Is aphakic Has undergone corneal refractive surgery . For purpose study , active* ocular disease define infection inflammation require therapeutic treatment . Mild ( i.e . consider clinically relevant ) lid abnormality ( blepharitis , meibomian gland dysfunction , papilla ) , corneal conjunctival stain dry eye consider active ocular disease . Neovascularization corneal scar result previous hypoxia , infection inflammation therefore active . Participants exclude significant slit lamp finding ( e.g . infiltrate slit lamp finding Grade 3 : corneal edema , tarsal abnormality , conjunctival injection ) active ocular disease ( e.g . glaucoma , history recurrent corneal erosion , intraocular infection inflammation allergic , bacterial , viral etiology ) For purpose study , participant excluded** , currently take medication , oral antihistamine , antihistamine eye drop , oral ophthalmic betaadrenergic blocker ( e.g . Propanolol , Timolol ) , anticholinergic , oral steroid prescribe overthecounter eye medication , except artificial tear eye lubricant</criteria>
