	<brief_title>CAP : Doxazosin Treatment Co-Occurring PTSD Alcohol Use Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Due sustain military conflict Afghanistan Iraq past decade , increase number U.S. military personnel Veterans return home posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) comorbid alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) . If leave untreated , Veterans co-occurring PTSD substance use disorder increase risk develop mental health problem ( e.g. , depression , anxiety ) , suicidal ideation attempt , physical health problem , reduce resiliency military readiness , employment problem , violence , family/relationship impairment . While mental health service place U.S. service member , substantial gap treatment co-occurring PTSD AUD exist little scientific evidence available guide provision care . As part Consortium Alleviate PTSD ( CAP ) , propose study directly address critical knowledge gap test efficacy doxazosin , long-acting selective alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist , compare placebo reduce PTSD AUD severity among U.S. military personnel . The common substance use disorder among Veterans alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) ; thus propose study target Veterans co-occurring PTSD AUD . The medication investigate ( doxazosin XL ) represent novel treatment approach PTSD/AUD . While prazosin , also alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist , show improve sleep nightmare military personnel PTSD may help reduce substance use severity , short half-life 2-3 hour require multiple dos day , significant limitation . In several pilot study , doxazosin show promise significantly reduce symptom PTSD AUD , contrast prazosin , require per day dose confers significant advantage term translate positive finding routine clinical practice . In Stage II study , investigator ( 1 ) employ two-arm randomize , double-blind , between-groups experimental design consist 12 week treatment doxazosin XL placebo medication ; ( 2 ) use standardize , repeat dependent measure rigorously ass PTSD symptomatology AUD severity 5 time point ( baseline , week 4 , week 8 , week 12 6-week follow-up ) ; ( 3 ) measure impairment associate mental behavioral health problem ( e.g. , depression , anxiety , sleep , risky behavior , family/social functioning ) ; ( 4 ) use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) investigate underlie pathophysiology comorbid PTSD/AUD identify prognostic indicator treatment outcome . To achieve aim , investigator assemble multidisciplinary team investigator nationally-recognized expertise combat-related PTSD , substance use disorder neuroimaging successfully collaborate past uniquely qualified implement type investigation .
