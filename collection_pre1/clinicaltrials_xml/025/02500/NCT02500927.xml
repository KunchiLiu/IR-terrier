	<brief_title>A Study ASP8273 Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor ( EGFR ) Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor-Naïve Patients With Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Harboring EGFR Mutations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study consist single-dose period ( Cycle 0 last 3 day ) multiple-dose period ( Cycle 1 onwards , cycle last 21 day ) . To compare PK ASP8273 Capsules ASP8273 Capsules A , enrolled subject receive single oral dose ASP8273 Capsules A Day 1 Cycle 0 single-dose period observe 3 day ( include day dose ) . In multiple-dose period , subject receive multiple oral dos ASP8273 Capsules cycle last 21 day . From viewpoint PK comparison ( bioavailability [ BA ] evaluation ) ASP8273 Capsules ASP8273 Capsules A , data approximately 15 subject sufficient evaluation . Therefore , PK data approximately 15 subject include BA evaluation obtain sponsor judge acquisition PK data necessary , single-dose period conduct subject enrol thereafter ( subject include BA evaluation ) . Subjects continue receive treatment ASP8273 meet discontinuation criterion .</detailed_description>
