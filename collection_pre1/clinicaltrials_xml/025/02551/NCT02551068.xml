	<brief_title>High Oxygen Delivery Preserve Exercise Capacity Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis Patients Treated With Nintedanib</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pulmonary rehabilitation structure evidence-based exercise education intervention recommend patient IPF . Pulmonary rehabilitation improve functional capacity ( 6-minute walk distance [ 6MWD ] ) , breathlessness quality life patient , however benefit often modest temporary . Nintedanib antifibrotic medication show slow decline lung function . Use antifibrotic medication pulmonary rehabilitation setting may therefore allow prolonged benefit exercise training prevent IPF progression result worsen symptom functional decline . Unpublished data suggest breathe 60 % oxygen pulmonary rehabilitation setting could enable patient train high exercise intensity thus derive great physiological adaptation clinical benefit compare traditional pulmonary rehabilitation . This randomized , blind study two arm ( standard care 60 % oxygen ) . The decision start stop treatment nintedanib make participant treat physician base clinical finding . If treat physician decides discontinue nintedanib , participant allow continue study . The exercise training program 8 week long , visit 3 time week . In addition exercise training 13 visit occur , 8 week exercise training program . At study visit , participant require conduct 6 minute walk test complete quality life questionnaire . Select study visit also require lung function test exercise test conduct .</detailed_description>
