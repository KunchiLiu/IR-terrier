	<detailed_description>Patients receive ACY 241 dose escalation accord 3 + 3 design combination paclitaxel dose schedule use clinical practice patient population treat protocol . Patients undergo screen assessment protocol eligibility within 28 day study start ( Cycle 1 Day 1 ) . Patients receive ACY 241 oral administration daily ( QD ) , support PK safety data , twice daily 21 consecutive day 28 day treatment cycle . Paclitaxel administer patient 80 mg/m2 IV 1 hour Days 1 , 8 , 15 28 day treatment cycle . Patients experience DLT unacceptable toxicity Cycle 1 remove study treatment . Patients receive study treatment document progressive disease ( PD ) unacceptable toxicity . Each cohort consist least 3 patient . Patients withdraw consent Cycle 1 replace . An assessment safety make Safety Review Committee ( SRC ) dose escalation . The SRC compose Study Investigators , Sponsor 's Medical Monitor Clinical Project Lead , Contract Research Organization 's Safety Monitor , Project Manager , Biometrician .
