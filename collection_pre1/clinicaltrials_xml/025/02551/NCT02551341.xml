	<detailed_description>Protocol Summary Purpose : The project investigate whether suspect lung protective ventilator therapy connection surgery cancer prostate ( prostate ) relevant beneficial effect lung function , renal function circulation associate keyhole surgery perform surgical robot . Trial method : The trial randomize study ( randomize control trial ) , draw normal suspect lung protective ventilator treatment connection surgical removal prostate due Cancers . Before operation , collect urine blood sample study lung function circulation start point . During operation , follow two day collect urine blood sample . Prepare Furthermore , new study lung function circulation . Blood test lung function study also outpatient control 1 week surgery . The two group patient ( respectively normal respiratory therapy suspect lung protective ) compare subsequent term . Impact lung function , renal function circulation well number severity complication compare ass whether suspected lung protective ventilator therapy safe provide adequate beneficial effect introduce standard future . Tissue sample use form blood test urine test MHP research biobank experiment . This tissue use analyze specific project tissue destroy current guideline project completion . Side effect risk : There every blood sample small risk infection bleeding . Using standard sterile technique . Blood volume remove blood test max 250 ml total . Removing amount blood entail health risk patient . There may discomfort around injection site , needle drop wrong arm , use standard sterile technique drop experienced personnel . Blood sample experiment perform routine blood sample equipment specify department 's instruction . For lung study case could detect certain constriction small branch airway ( bronchus ) . To determine whether condition may require treatment give ally spray suck , aim expand branch order improve lung function . This medication cause slight transient dizziness palpitation . Disadvantages : The additional lung examination study attempt establish connection patient 's usual attendance stay hospital avoid extra visit . There must calculate extra time spend outpatient visit connection participation trial . There economic disadvantage associate trial patient . Economic condition : There economic disadvantage associate trial patient . Funding project do joint financing Urology Department D , Department Anesthesiology University Clinic Kidney disease high blood pressure , Hospital West Aarhus University . Research fund seek public private fund . Publication trial result : The result , positive negative finding , make publish internationally recognize scientific journal anonymously personally identifiable data . Research Ethics statement : The project report Ethical Science Council Central Denmark Region . Database project must approve Data Protection Agency Region Central . The project start approval two body . The project comply applicable GCP rule . Recruitment participant : First contact patient project via operator , Urology Department , information interview operation . If patient want get information project hand write information project manager contact . The write information consist : Participant Information , consent form , `` Information subject '' `` Your Rights test subject biomedical research . '' The patient inform write orally right opportunity bring legal counsel inform consent . The project manager representative hold subsequent information interview 7 day surgery . This last approximately 30 minute . Information conduct consultation room clinic , activity allocate room interview . The anesthesia controller deputy hold right usual anesthesia monitor ensure write consent . At oral information , patient inform request participate biomedical research . Patients informed acc . guideline `` Guidelines review , etc . biomedical research ethic committee system `` Central Scientific Ethical Committee . Information provide experiment , list Annex 1 `` Information volunteer . '' The subject , wish participate advise , wish , get consideration submit write consent participate research voluntary , always able draw commit participation back . The subject inform receive information result achieve research reporting project interested . Written informed consent give project manager anesthetic consultant deputy project connection information interview , journal record anesthesia monitoring . The subject sign concent- proxy statement , keep Data Protection Agency guideline . A copy provide subject .</detailed_description>
