	<brief_summary>The study evaluate whether long-term treatment colchicine reduce rate cardiovascular event patient myocardial infarction . Patients suffer documented acute myocardial infarction within last 30 day , treat accord national guideline complete planned percutaneous revascularization procedure associate initial infarction receive either colchicine ( 0.5 mg per day ) match placebo ( 1:1 allocation ratio ) estimate 2 year period target 301 primary endpoint reach .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Atherosclerosis common cause myocardial infarction , stroke peripheral arterial disease . Research clearly demonstrate inflammation play key role initiation , progression manifestation atherosclerosis . Atherosclerotic lesion begin accumulation lipid-laden cell ( primarily macrophages ) beneath endothelium , progress accumulation cell , connective-tissue element , lipid debris immunological inflammatory activation . Neutrophils inflammatory cell show invade culprit atherosclerotic lesion acute coronary syndrome . It likely inflammatory process responsible high rate cardiovascular event despite significant advance treatment risk factor hypercholesterolemia hypertension . It vital improve understand inflammatory nature atherosclerotic disease modify inflammatory process target therapy . Prospective cohort study consistently show high sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP ) several biomarkers inflammation independently associate increase risk future cardiovascular event different population . This together animal model show reduced inflammation anti-atherosclerotic effect , create impetus test hypothesis treatment underlie inflammatory process contribute improve cardiovascular clinical outcome . Colchicine inexpensive , yet potent , anti-inflammatory drug approve acute use patient gout chronic use patient Familial Mediterranean Fever . The mechanism action inhibition tubulin polymerization potentially also effect cellular adhesion molecule inflammatory chemokines . Colchicine may also direct anti-inflammatory effect inhibit key inflammatory signal network know inflammasome pro-inflammatory cytokine . Through disruption cytoskeleton , colchicine believe suppress secretion cytokine chemokines well vitro platelet aggregation . Considerable work highlight potential colchicine treatment cardiovascular disease mediate pro-inflammatory process . More recently colchicine evaluated effect cardiovascular event patient coronary artery disease ( CAD ) .</detailed_description>
