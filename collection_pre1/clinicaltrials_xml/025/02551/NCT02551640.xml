	<brief_summary>The goal study explore effect FeatForward physical activity cardio-metabolic risk factor . The study implement 2-arm randomized control trial ( RCT ) compare effect FeatForward patient assign use application versus control group use app 6-month follow-up period . The investigator hypothesize subject use FeatForward physically active achieve great improvement cardio-metabolic risk ( CMR ) factor usual care control group use app 6-month period .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Physical Activity Through mHealth Intervention Cardio-metabolic Risk Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>TextToMove ( TTM ) dynamic text messaging program investigator develop 2012 goal increase physical activity patient type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , improve self-management disease , lower HbA1c level . TTM since evaluate PHRC-approved randomize control trial . In current propose study , investigator plan convert TTM mobile application smartphone use , increase improved functionality potential easy translation additional use case . The investigator use feedback gathered user observation previous trial shape development plan second iteration , aptly name `` FeatForward . '' The FeatForward app hyper-personalized user respond specifically individual user ' behavior pattern application feel like intelligent health coach partner user achieve good health outcome . What define FeatForward TTM additional feature , include incorporation machine learn component message algorithm , tailor message frequency base user ' activity level , integration patient data electronic medical record Remote Monitoring Data Repository , input improve generalizability feedback regard health metric ( e.g. , weight , blood glucose ) , well community feature enable interaction similar patient comprehensive educational library . FeatForward 's primary goal help user increase level physical activity . Physical inactivity identify one lead risk factor contribute rise rate chronic disease . And despite common cardio-metabolic risk ( CMR ) factor , also happen easy target . Current estimate suggest half ( 52 % ) adult United States meet recommend physical activity level . A number study date demonstrate dose-response protective effect increase physical activity development diabetes cardiovascular disease . Therefore , investigator hypothesize FeatForward help user increase physical activity level also lead improvement cardio-metabolic risk factor compare usual care control use intervention .</detailed_description>
