	<brief_summary>One 100 people suffers coeliac disease . It affect line bowel cause many symptom diarrhoea , wind , stomach pain , constipation nausea . The treatment far strict glutenfree diet life reverse bowel damage often improve symptom . Up 25 % patient however may persistent symptom despite gluten free diet reason clear . This research aim help u understand gluten free diet work . Investigators use medical imaging ( magnetic resonance image MRI ) measure volumes fluid small bowel , size large bowel time take food go entire bowel patient diagnose coeliac disease hospital doctor . Investigators also carry breath test collect stool sample basic analysis stool bacteria . Investigators also collect questionnaire feeling bowel habit try see MRI measurement relate patient ' symptom . Investigators observe measure change one year gluten free diet doctor prescribe part coeliac patient ' standard care . As dietary intervention study , investigator simply study change patient due standard treatment . Investigators also look match group healthy volunteer gather likely reference range measurement . This research carry Nottingham help specialist coeliac clinic last 3 year . There dedicated Coeliac Patient Public Involvement group help plan study .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypotheses study Based investigator ' pilot data literature available , study aim test main hypothesis adult newly diagnose coeliac disease treatment GFD : 1. reduce water content fast small bowel 2. reduce volume fast colon 3. increase whole gut transit time Objectives study The specific objective study therefore quantify change follow treatment gluten-free diet ( GFD ) : 1. water content fast small bowel 2. fast colon volume 3. whole gut transit time adult newly diagnose coeliac disease use non-invasive MRI Co-variates interest During study investigator measure series exploratory co-variates interest diagnosis 12 month follow-up : 1 . BMI 2 . Gastrointestinal symptom ( Bristol Stool diary week , HAD , PHQ-15 , IBSS , QOL , GI symptoms VAS scale ) 3 . Marsh grade D2 segment duodenal biopsy ( define routine clinical assessment NUH ) 4 . Fasting breath hydrogen 5 . Serology value ( tTG , EMA ) 6 . Faecal microbiota short chain fatty acid In subgroup analysis , investigator describe association ( ) MRI outcomes co-variates : 1. treatment , 2. treatment 3. difference two . The latter represent useful analysis . By use treatment measure outcome treatment measure covariate mathematically equivalent analyse change treatment ( adjusted baseline ) . Parallel Healthy Volunteers group This study also include parallel pilot study healthy volunteer ( HVs ) frequency match age ( 20 year band ) gender provide descriptive statistic likely reference range healthy population inform design future study . A pilot study 36 newly diagnose coeliac disease patient gluten-free diet . University base Pilot study patient : There data available estimate size change water content fast small bowel patient hence pilot study . The investigator ' MRI pilot data n=20 untreated , newly diagnose coeliac patient show fast small bowel water content ( mean ± SD ) 202 ± 115 ml volume . We predict able detect change 40 % ( reduction 80 ml volume ) gluten free diet power 90 % Type I error probability 0.05 use n=24 patient pair study design . This consider clinically significant change gluten free diet ; change reflect twice level normal control value 65 ± 43 ml volume . Investigators plan recruit n=36 allow dropout increase power also secondary outcome . ) Pilot study healthy volunteer ( HVs ) : For exploratory purpose provide pilot reference data design future study , investigator aim collect data 36 HVs 36 patient 36 healthy volunteer . Pilot study coeliac disease : Investigations include : 1 . Magnetic Resonance Imaging - 2 scan 12 month apart 2 . Self-administered symptom questionnaires 3 . Stool sample 4 . Hydrogen breath test The patient biopsy serology part standard care . The healthy volunteer undergo blood sample part screen biopsy take . Duration study = 36 month . Duration study participant = around 12 month . Follow-up participant stop 12 month fail receive subsequent MRI scan There randomisation blind simple pilot study . Primary endpoint 1 . Fasting small bowel water content ( SBWC ) measure ml approximately 12 month initiation GFD Secondary endpoints 2 . Fasting colon volume measure ml 3 . Whole gut transit time measure hour Co-variates analysis indicate The basic characteristic study population calculate use frequency proportion . Objective 1 : For cohort patient newly diagnose coeliac disease , investigator compare mean difference fast small bowel water content ( primary outcome ) initiation GFD . This do use Paired Test 5 % level significance . This assume normality data , data high level skewness non-parametric method use . In order ass potential effect modification age gender , investigator stratify analysis variable . For purpose age consider categorical variable analyse 20 year bands . This analysis conduct case complete follow-up data MRI scan . Objectives 2 3 : This analysis repeat two secondary outcome , namely volume fast colon gastrointestinal transit time . Co-variate analysis coeliac disease group . The potential association co-variates ( gastrointestinal symptom , Marsh grade etc . ) three MRI outcome assess use stepwise linear regression analysis . Investigators also assess magnitude effect term mean difference along respective confidence interval . The analysis would separately conduct outcome co-variates record first subsequent MRI scan . Should analysis highlight particularly strong association , investigator attempt input regression model predict either baseline value change GFD . Pilot study HVs The HVs group include provide pilot reference data inform design future study . Investigators compare small bowel water content among coeliac disease case HVs ( control ) , compare mean difference pre- post-measurement case control use linear regression .</detailed_description>
