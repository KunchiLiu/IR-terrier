	<brief_title>HPV Vaccination : An Investigation Physician Reminders Recommendation Scripts</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Rationale : Human papillomavirus ( HPV ) vaccine uptake among female male remain unacceptably low . Health care provider recommendation HPV vaccine major driver vaccine acceptance . Conversely , failure health care provider recommend HPV vaccine repeatedly identify primary factor non-vaccination . Among many recommendation increase HPV vaccination rate several specifically target health care provider . Two approach implementation electronic health records-based decision support system intervention design help physician recommend HPV vaccine routine , matter-of-fact manner address uneasiness discuss sexual activity parent adolescent . A randomized , 3-arm interventional study propose . The 3 arm ( randomize level health care provider ) : 1. usual practice ; 2. automate reminder recommend HPV vaccine eligible male female adolescent clinic visit ; 3. automate reminder PLUS suggest recommendation script . Here draft recommendation script study team propose third arm study : `` Three vaccine recommend &lt; first name &gt; , meningococcal prevent meningitis , HPV prevent cancer , Tdap prevent tetanus . All three recommend age '' . The script draft base principle Diffusion Theory theory learn memory . Diffusion Theory predict adoption innovation ( case recommendation script ) predict three central factor : 1 . The innovation see superior approach intend replace ( ADVANTAGE ) ; 2 . The innovation view consistent pre-existing belief experience ( COMPATIBILITY ) ; 3 . The innovation see easy understand implement ( COMPLEXITY ) . It believe propose script meet ADVANTAGE criterion provide simple , straightforward way introduce HPV vaccine conversation adolescent parent , issue physician struggle . The script meet COMPATIBILITY criterion make HPV vaccine recommendation consistent way vaccine typically recommend conversation adolescent parent . Finally , propose script meet COMPLEXITY criterion simple likely time-saving case . Furthermore , exist electronic health record ( EHR ) infrastructure target clinic support easy introduction recommendation script clinical workflow . Research learn memory show information present first last sequence great salience therefore likely remember . In suggested script , HPV vaccine purposely middle , Tdap meningococcal vaccine decrease salience HPV vaccination , thereby help physician treat three vaccine consistent manner . When HPV vaccine mention last , may tendency hesitate treat separate recommend vaccine . Approximately 30 pediatric health care provider randomize across 3 arm equal number . The primary outcome interest , HPV vaccination , evaluate patient outcome nest within provider . Physician acceptance recommendation , compare change vaccination rate qualitative feedback provider assess . To gather qualitative feedback , 3-4 pediatric health care provider clinic interview . Participants purposely select base provider demographic , include gender , year practice , role within clinic organizational structure . The interview guide Consolidated Framework Implementation Research ( CFIR ) , theory evidence-based framework represent accumulate result 50 year research implementation diffusion . Mixed method enable team examine impact vaccination rate also characteristic reminder ( e.g. , usability , support workflow ) , implementation , context setting implement ( e.g. , clinical structure ) . Aims Objectives Aim 1 . To evaluate effect physician-targeted automate HPV vaccination reminder alone reminder plus recommended script HPV vaccination rate among 9-12 year old male female patient . Hypothesis . It expect linear increase HPV vaccination rate across usual practice control group two intervention condition , reminder + script group high first dose HPV vaccination rate , follow reminder-only group note . Secondary objective : To evaluate rate return second dose . Exploratory objective : To evaluate experience pediatric health care provider reminder script intervention . Materials Methods : The Child Health Improvement Computer Automation ( CHICA ) system , describe detail , already develop operation since November 2004 . The functionality well document . New component system develop study . The first activation CHICA 's ability randomize alert provider . The second development Arden Syntax rule ( Medical Logic Modules ) query data immunization registry generate appropriate prompt reminder clinician . Once write , rule must encode CHICA extensively test clinical data deploy . Third , study team develop mechanism CHICA query immunization registry time point clinic visit determine whether HPV vaccine administer . Include potential difficulty limitation available method strategy overcome method . Randomization physician depend accurate data clinic 's registration system physician patient see . The study team use information past without significant problem . However , note data miss unreliable significant number case , study team ask information entered system clinic personnel prior visit . Programming Arden rule part parcel operate CHICA system . So study team anticipate problem develop test . The study team closely monitor display response CHICA reminder . If problem , study team able detect correct quickly . The ability query CHIRP immunization registry Health Level Seven International ( HL7 ) message recently develop . The response CHIRP perfect , well 90 % reliable . The study team build system query CHIRP HPV data track reissue fail query order maximize available data . The location study site . As previously note , study conduct five clinic Eskenazi Health System currently use CHICA . They : Eskenazi Outpatient Care Center , Blackburn , Pecar , Eskenazi 38th St. , Forest Manor . Outcome measurement . The outcome primary interest , HPV vaccine uptake , record CHICA system re-query CHIRP system visit . The study team record whether HPV vaccine administer . The CHICA system program track patient enrol study . Between 7 30 day clinic visit , CHICA send HL7 query vaccination ( VXQ ) message patient CHIRP immunization registry Indiana State Department Health . In response query message , CHIRP send HL7 vaccination record response ( VXR ) message patient 's immunization record . Because CHICA clinic report immunization data CHIRP , reliable way ass whether patient receive HPV vaccine . Predictors HPV vaccine uptake . The study team use re-query CHIRP determine vaccine ( e.g. , meningococcal ; Tdap ; influenza ) administer . Other variables interest record provider see , patient age , patient gender . The 5 CHICA clinic study sit locate throughout metropolitan Indianapolis . These clinic serve largely low income ( 70 % Medicaid ) minority ( 33 % Hispanic , 49 % African American ) child . CHICA provide data 37,000 child since first implement 2004 . As indicated Part 1 ( Introduction ) , CHICA clinic use successfully multiple pediatric health service intervention study . The real-world implementation use study great strength . It enable u evaluate reminder system recommend script influence HPV vaccination practice busy pediatric clinic . An inherent limitation kind study study team limit kind data collect . The study team , instance , collect attitude/knowledge information parent . However , believe strengths research methodology far outweigh limitation . Qualitative interview . Interviews digitally record transcribed . Interviewers ask record field note related interview capture information include transcript ( e.g. , tone voice ) . Digital recording transfer password-protected computer , locked office . Recordings transcript save 3-year period end study . At point time , digital recording transcript permanently erase . Content analysis enable investigator identify patterns respondent ' answer . The study team specifically look barrier implementation use recommendation script well contextual aspect facilitate routine use recommendation script improve adherence recommend HPV vaccination guideline .</detailed_description>
