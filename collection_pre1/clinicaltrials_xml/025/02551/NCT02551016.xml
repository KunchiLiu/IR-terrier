	<brief_title>Heart Failure Recorded Primary Care , Hospital Admissions National Mortality Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Heart failure ( HF ) one lead cause hospital admission mortality modern healthcare system . It view collective clinical syndrome many sign symptom frequently common endpoint various heart disease . Often , diagnose reach level whereby quality life significantly , often irreversibly , impair . Even though vast quantity National Health Service ( NHS ) data concern patient heart failure record , limited 'real world ' longitudinal insight prognosis consequence HF . Although link electronic health record cohorts CALIBER program become increasingly available , heart failure overlap , risk factor subsequent mortality compare . Previous study heart failure use EHR source use ICD-9 10 code identification heart failure case prevalence estimate risk factor comorbidity . Furthermore , assessment support information heart failure present electronic healthcare registry remain largely unknown . Currently , heart failure typically infer base previous report prescription heart failure relate medication . To strengthen heart failure case ascertainment large electronic healthcare registry , linkages primary care data do CALIBER could allow detailed insight medical history , clinical diagnosis , anthropometric measure , health behaviour , laboratory test , medical procedure prescription . In study , investigator assess distribution recording , supportive medical information heart failure diagnosis , risk factor subsequent mortality heart failure patient capture link EHR data primary care , hospital admission and/or death registry . This study part CALIBER ( Cardiovascular disease research use link bespoke study electronic record ) programme fund 5 year NIHR Wellcome Trust . CALIBER receive Ethics approval ( ref 09/H0810/16 ) ECC approval ( ref ECC 2-06 ( b ) /2009 CALIBER dataset ) .</detailed_description>
