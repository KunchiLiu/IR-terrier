	<brief_title>Subfoveal Choroidal Thickness Thai Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alteration choroidal blood supply cause change choroidal thickness result choroidal abnormality . These usually associate retinal disease lead severe visual dysfunction . Choroidal thickness therefore helpful diagnosis treatment many chorioretinal condition . With advent spectral domain optical coherence tomography enhance depth imaging technique , choroidal thickness investigate widely normal eye various chorioretinal disease include central serous chorioretinopathy ( CSC ) , age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) , highly myopia Vogt Koyanagi-Harada disease . Similar retinal thickness , normal baseline choroidal thickness might use interpretation . This value might affect several variable include age , gender ethnicity . Although previous study subfoveal choroidal thickness normal eye many country , study Thailand . The purpose study determine subfoveal choroidal thickness normal Thai eye study association gender , age , refractive error axial length use SD-OCT EDI technique .</detailed_description>
