	<criteria>Patients diagnosis COPD ( mild severe disease ) base postbronchodilator FEV1 value patient FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.70 . No previous use DPI . Over either current smoker history smoke &gt; 10 year . ( e.g. , 10 pack year = 1 pack/day × 10 year , ½ pack/day × 20 year , etc . ) : Note : A pack cigarettes equal 20 cigarette . Occasional smoking cigar relevant smoke history . An exsmoker define patient smoked ≥6 month screen . Willing able reproducibly perform spirometry inhalational manoeuvers require protocol . Willing able comprehend follow instruction use inhalational device test study . Questions request clarification regard eligibility particular patient base inclusion criterion direct medical monitor patient enrol . History hypersensitivity component placebo use study compound similar chemical class . This include ( exhaustive ) patient know lactose allergy , allergy magnesium stearate , suffer paradoxical bronchospasm inhalation placebo medication . Patients receive treatment systemic corticosteroid , antibiotic , history suggestive acute COPD exacerbation and/or hospitalization within 12 week prior screen baseline period . Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman , define state female conception termination gestation , confirm positive urine pregnancy test . Women childbearing potential , defined woman physiologically capable become pregnant , UNLESS : Women reliable contraception method . Postmenopausal woman possibility become pregnant . Note : Women consider postmenopausal childbearing potential 12 month natural ( spontaneous ) amenorrhea appropriate clinical profile ( e.g . age appropriate , history vasomotor symptom ) six month spontaneous amenorrhea serum FSH level &gt; 40 mIU/mL surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week prior baseline . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment consider child bear potential . Patients history ( Visit 1 ) asthma indicate ( limited ) : Onset respiratory symptom suggestive asthma ( cough , wheeze , shortness breath ) prior age 40 . • History diagnosis asthma . Patients allergic rhinitis use H1 antagonist intranasal corticosteroid intermittently ( Treatment stable dose regimen permit ) . History clinically significant condition include : significant cardiovascular disease , uncontrolled diabetes , history noncompliance , alcohol drug abuse , patient active cancer , condition opinion investigator make patient unsuitable participation study .
