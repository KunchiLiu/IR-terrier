	<brief_summary>This study involve people eat disorder healthy volunteer ( people never experience eat disorder ) . Participants interview psychological physical health experimenter simulate scan session ( 1 hour ) . Approximately 1 week attend first study session . They ask complete questionnaire computerize task ( 30 minute ) follow active scan ( 1 hour ) . During brain scan look picture answer question picture . After first study session , people eat disorder receive intensive meal-support intervention ( follow 3 month ) aim reduce anxiety fear relate food ( 10 session last 60 min. ) . Three month first brain scan , participant eat disorder healthy control receive second assessment brain scan . We hypothesize meal support intervention effective : 1 ) target eat disorder symptom ( body mass index - BMI , primarily ) 2 ) produce functional change brain region underline food-related anxiety avoidance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Anorexia nervosa ( AN ) characterize severe malnutrition . Patients report aversive experience re-feeding frequently drop-out treatment . This study test hypothesis gradual guide exposure food associate increase body mass index ( BMI ) reduce eat disorder psychopathology patient AN . It also hypothesize intervention lead change brain activation region implicate anticipatory anxiety fear food emotion regulation ( i.e . amygdala , insula , dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex [ DLPFC ] ) . Sixteen woman anorexia nervosa receive intervention time study recruit community . Patients complete range self-report measure undergo functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) scan receive 10 exposure therapy session 3 month . A matched healthy control group ( n=20 ) also two brain scan 3 month apart . To eligible study , participant female , proficient English , right-handed , 19 60 year . Participants clinical group meet DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criterion anorexia nervosa . Participants healthy control group require BMI 18.5 25 kg/m² history , current , mood anxiety disorder .

Pre- post-intervention change patient ' BMI , anxiety , eat disorder symptom , mood motivation change assess .
