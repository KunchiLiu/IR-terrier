	<brief_title>MLN1117 Combination With Docetaxel , Paclitaxel , Other Investigational Anticancer Agents Treat Participants With Gastric Gastroesophageal Adenocarcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study look dose-limiting toxicity response treatment participant take MLN1117 combination TAK-659 , paclitaxel docetaxel investigational TAK-659 investigational alisertib . The study enroll approximately 60 participant dose escalation phase ( Part 1 ) 118 participant dose expansion phase ( Part 2 ) . Participants randomly assign 1 4 treatment group : - MLN1117 + TAK-659 - MLN1117 + alisertib - MLN1117 + paclitaxel - MLN1117 + docetaxel In Part 1 , dose MLN1117 increase step step . All participant ask take tablet MLN1117 3 day 4 day per week 28-day treatment cycle 21-day treatment cycle give combination companion drug . This multi-centre trial conduct worldwide .</detailed_description>
