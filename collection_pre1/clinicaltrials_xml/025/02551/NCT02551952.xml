	<brief_summary>INTRODUCTION : Cognitive dysfunction frequent adverse event postoperative period , especially elderly patient . The test commonly use detection postoperative cognitive dysfunction time-consuming variable sensitivity specificity difficult routine use . Applying difficult battery cognitive test decrease viability adopt measure increase preoperative cognitive reserve method prevention , diagnosis rehabilitation case Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction ( POCD ) , desirable search alternative method diagnosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Digital Game : A Scale Evaluate Perioperative Cognitive Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Thinking concern , investigator create digital game assess quickly funny cognitive function ( memory ; attention executive ) . The investigator know digital game potential neuromodulator effect use alternative psychotherapeutic treatment rehabilitation cognitive skill . However , experience game assess integrity perioperative neuropsychological function still scarce . It hypothesize digital game replace commonly used neuropsychological test detect postoperative cognitive dysfunction . The aim study validate specific digital game ( MentalPlus® ) cognitive assessment evaluation use detect postoperative cognitive dysfunction . METHODS : The participant study 20 year old , literate , gender candidate surgery general anesthesia Clinics Hospital Faculty Medicine , University São Paulo . Will also apply neuropsychological test evaluate memory , attention , executive function well another test assess specific content useful describe sample research ' result . The test apply specific data set . In another study investigator include volunteer assess short long term memory Verbal Learnings Test ( VLT ) , visual memory Recognition Memory Test ( TEM-R ) , executive function STROOP Test selective alternate attention Trail Making Test ( TMT-A / B ) . For Quality Life investigator use Patient Health Questionnaire ( PHQ-9 ) Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI-II ) Beck Anxiety Inventory ( BAI ) ass depressive anxiety symptom , beyond MentalPlus® . In third project investigator use functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) ass association brain response cognitive training MentalPlus® . Reliability analysis perform validity digital game assess term evaluation cognitive function fun practical way may provide health professional , include anesthesiologist surgeon new method neuropsychological evaluation . Detail description neuropsychological test scale : Sociodemographic data analyze include education , marital status , occupation , current medication . Signs symptoms depression ass preoperatively use Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) , screen global cognitive use Telephone Interview Cognitive Status ( TICS ) , use Verbal Learning Test ( VLT ) long-term memory Recognition Memory Test ( TEM-R ) visual memory , Symbol Digit Modified Test ( SDMT ) use assess short-term memory , visual search skill attention , STROOP Test ass selective attention , inhibitory ability mental flexibility construct executive function Trail Making Test ( TMT ) assessment selective alternate attention . Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) , consist 21 question explore depressive symptom scale 0 4 , zero represent symptom four maximum symptomatology . A total 14 point consider indicative presence moderate depressive symptoms22 . Patient Questionnaire health ( PHQ-9 ) , questionnaire health patient instrument 9 question . Each question 4 possible response : 0 ( day ) , 1 ( several day ) , 2 ( half day ) , 3 ( nearly every day ) . The PHQ-9 interpret three way : 10 form algorithm , identify individual major depressive episode track probable case major depressive disorder ; 20 continuous measure , score 0 27 point , able ass level depressive symptom cut- point 5 , 10 , 15 20 point = mild depression , moderate , severe serious ; 30 continuous measurement score 0 27 point , classify individual dichotomous use single cutting point ( typically ≥10 ) . The Telephone Interview Cognitive Status ( TICS ) use standardized test ass neuropsychological functioning assess cognitive skill . This test use screen personally impractical patient unable attend clinic . This test consist structure interview 11 item assess skill spatial temporal orientation , mental control , memory , general information , language calculation . Memory assess use Verbal Learning Test ( VLT ) test consist list word . A list 15 word present must store recall three successive attempt ( VLT / A-B-C ) , delay recall 25 minute ( VLT-Delay ) . Rate number word recall number error presentation . The VLT evaluate modality memory immediate , consolidated long-term . This instrument hold two stage : pre-operative time 1st evaluation surgery postoperatively second final assessment day 10 15 postoperatively . The Recognition Memory Test ( TEM-R ) consist store picture word identify remember stimulus . For stimulus response present subject graphic form ( figure ) write ( word ) . This instrument hold two stage : pre-operative time 1st evaluation surgery postoperatively second final assessment day 10 15 postoperatively . The Symbol Digit Modified Test ( SDMT ) apply evaluation short-term memory , visual search skill attention . This graphical task individual fill symbol exemplify space correspond number within 180 second . The result measure number symbol draw number error . Attention assess STROOP Test , consist present three paper sheet subject . The first one , patient verbalize name color print black ink . In second , verbalization make color fill rectangle , provision word previous slide . The third blade consist verbalize color print write word . Evaluates selective attention , inhibitory ability mental flexibility construct executive function . Scores obtain include number word ( Word task ) , number bar color ( Color ) , number color word ( Color-Word ) complete within set time , note , amount time require complete task . We consider number error well . Attention also evaluate use Trail Making Test ( TMT ) assessment selective alternate attention . In part A test , subject must draw line connect consecutively numbered circle . In part B , subject must draw line connect circle alternately letter number sequence . The result measure time trail error . The Attention function examine Trail Making Test ( TMT ) . This test consist two part . In Part A , subject must draw line connect consecutively numbered circle . In Part B , subject must draw line alternately connect circle letter number sequence . The test involve addition alternate selective attention , visual screening complex manual dexterity ( Part A ) executive process ( Part B ) . Among executive procedure , inhibitory ability cognitive alternate seem require complete task . They value time spend number error . These instrument hold two stage : pre-operative time 1st evaluation surgery postoperatively second final assessment day 10 15 postoperatively . About scale validation : study guide validation digital game MentalPlus® form scale assess neuropsychological function : attention , memory , executive . This scale measure score range 0 20 corrects error . Attention function : 0 ( zero ) correspond much trouble ( many error ) ; twenty ( 20 ) correspond full capacity ( correct total ) . For executive function assess : capacity resistance distractor factor measure much person touch tablet 's screen order demonstrate failure inhibitory control action . Scores 0 20 0 ( zero ) mean great inhibitory control twenty ( 20 ) total inability inhibitory control . For memory function assess long-term memory , work memory short-term visual memory . The score function range 0 20 , 0 ( zero ) total memorize inability long-term task twenty ( 20 ) total long-term storage capacity evaluate 25 minute exposure figure memorize . For work memory expose 7 icon mention next five minute exposure . Seven ( 7 ) = good ability manipulate information short-term time 0 ( zero ) inability store manipulate information short time .</detailed_description>
