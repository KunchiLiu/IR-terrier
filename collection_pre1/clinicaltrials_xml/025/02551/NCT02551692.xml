	<brief_summary>The goal study evaluate effect varenicline versus nicotine replacement versus placebo personal smoking environment cue ( PSE ) reactivity . The result study inform whether first-line pharmacotherapies nicotine dependence ( e.g . nicotine patch , varenicline ) alter reactivity environment cue . The investigator propose identify 120 regular cigarette smoker complete 10 visit ( 1 screen visit , 1 training visit , 1 camera turn-in 2 cue exposure session 4 post-quit medication check session ) . Smokers randomize one three medication condition : placebo ( PLAC ; n=40 ) , transdermal nicotine patch ( NRT ; n=40 ) varenicline ( VAR ; n=40 ) double blind , double-dummy design . Reactivity variable ( crave , latency smoke , smoke intake ) enter 3 ( Medication : NRT , VAR , PLAC ) x 2 ( Environment : smoking , nonsmoking ) repeat measure ANOVAs random-effects . The investigator hypothesize personal smoking , compare nonsmoking environment , associate great reactivity ( i.e . increase crave smoke intake ; decrease latency smoke ) . A Medication x Environment interaction characterize decreased reactivity smoking compare nonsmoking environment VAR NRT group compare PLAC group .</brief_summary>
