	<brief_summary>Huntington 's disease ( HD ) genetic progressive fatal neurodegenerative disorder . In western world affect 5-10 person per 100000 . The main brain change include loss brain cell subcortical structure . The symptom HD include involuntary movement , cognitive deterioration behavioural disturbance . It show change emotion comprehension occur onset motor symptom ( preHD ) . This deficit perception emotion primarily investigate mean facial expression . However , emotion also express body language . Here , investigator propose investigate whether emotion comprehension deficit preHD also include body language comprehension .</brief_summary>
