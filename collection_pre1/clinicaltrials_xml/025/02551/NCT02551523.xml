	<brief_summary>Long term toxicity combination antiretroviral therapy ( cART ) substantial contributor morbidity mortality chronically infect HIV positive individual . To date still debate , whether long term nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NRTI 's ) -sparing regimen practicable even superior compare standard care cART term efficacy , safety tolerability . In addition , data efficacy integrase inhibitor ( INSTI ) base monotherapy lack . We aim investigate efficacy standard care combination antiretroviral therapy simplify dolutegravir monotherapy patient primary HIV-1 infection suppressive early standard care antiretroviral therapy . Briefly , hundred-thirty-eight patient document primary HIV1- infection ( PHI ) recruit Zurich Primary HIV-1 Infection Study ( ZHPI ) , open label , non-randomized , observational , single-center study ( http : //clinicaltrials.gov , ID 5 NCT00537966 ) . All subject formerly underwent early cART consist either protease inhibitor ( PI ) non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) INSTI combination two NRTIs time point enrolment ZPHI must fully suppressive ART ( i.e. , &lt; 50 copies/ml ) least 48 week time point randomisation . The primary end point proportion individual viral failure week 48 .</brief_summary>
