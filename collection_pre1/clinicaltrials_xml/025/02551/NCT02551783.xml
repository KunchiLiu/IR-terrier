	<brief_summary>This randomize non-blinded comparison dorsal vs. ventral approach buccal mucosa graft urethroplasty bulbar urethra . Buccal mucosa graft common method repair strictured urethra . Current evidence suggest two approach placement graft equally successful correct stricture two approach similar risk complication . The investigator propose randomly assign appropriately select patient either dorsally- ventrally-placed graft . No additional procedure beyond normal care protocol require patient . Success assess via objective subjective method ; complication tally standardized fashion . Outcomes measured two year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Urethral stricture affect 1 % men rare woman . Most urethral stricture United States develop bulbar section urethra section urethra proximal penis distal prostate . A common method surgical correction longitudinally open strictured urethra augment width addition graft buccal mucosa take oral cavity . The urethrotomy placement graft make along superficial ( ventral ) deep ( dorsal ) side urethra . The graft bed dorsally tunica albuginea corporal body ( capsule around erectile body penis ) whereas ventrally corpus spongiosum urethra ( vascular layer surround urethra ) . Ventral buccal graft onlay first describe Morey McAninch 1996 , involve midline perineal incision retraction bulbo-spongiosum muscle downward expose ventral urethral surface . The corpus spongiosum incise longitudinally expose urethral lumen incision extend proximal distal establish stricture . The buccal mucosa graft harvest trimmed length width urethrotomy graft suture proximal distal apex run suture lateral margin establish tight anastomosis . Ventral placement allow limited urethral mobilization easy access concern high likelihood diverticulum formation development associate complication post-void dribble ejaculatory dysfunction . In addition , many surgeon concern graft contraction spread-fixating graft possible . Dorsal buccal graft onlay , first describe Barbagli 1996 , also involve midline perineal incision . The bulbo-cavernosum corpus cavernosum dissect bulbar urethra allow complete mobilization urethra . The urethra rotate 180 degree allow dorsal access incision make dorsal urethra proximal distal stricture location . The buccal graft harvest trimmed appropriate size urethrotomy spread overlie tunica albuginea corporal body . The right mucosal margin urethra suture right margin buccal graft corporal body . The urethra rotate back allow suturing leave mucosal margin leave margin buccal graft corporal body , essentially cover entire urethral plate . Dorsal placement potentially allow stable vascular bed graft sustainability less spongiosal bleeding , require great urethral mobilization longer operative time . The technical challenge graft placement dorsal location much great placement ventrally . Potential problem dorsal placement include damage male external urinary sphincter , dorsally locate , anastomotic leakage perineal abscess immediate post-operative period . There multiple study attempt compare outcomes ventral versus dorsal graft placement bulbar urethroplasty , study rely case series retrospective data . Andrich Mundy report well outcome dorsal buccal placement , statistical significance formally establish . Both Barbagli Figler unable demonstrate superiority either ventral dorsal buccal graft placement . Currently high level definitive randomized evidence suggest superiority either ventral dorsal buccal placement term patient outcome complication . In fact , best level evidence VI ( small case series ) dorsal vs. ventral placement largely dependent individual clinical judgment comfort level procedure . One factor contribute inability detect difference dorsal vs. ventral graft placement liberal definition success lead uniformly high success rate across study ( 85-95 % ) , hence , study underpowered detect difference success rate . In study , definition success typically `` need repeat surgery '' . Such definition suffers significant detection bias ( 1 ) subclinical stricture recurrence may go undetected screen ; ( 2 ) surgeon patient reluctance undergo repeat surgery may lead false negative . When patient rigorously follow endoscopic inspection area surgery cystoscopy , narrow often identify much high rate `` need repeat surgery '' . For instance , preliminary review retrospective data use surveillance cystoscopy , investigator detect narrow 46 % ventral buccal patient approximately 18 % dorsal buccal patient . This strict definition success low success rate follow may allow detection clinically meaningful difference success rate two procedure reasonably-sized clinical trial . The investigator plan randomize comparison dorsally-placed vs. ventrally-placed buccal mucosa graft men undergo buccal graft urethroplasty bulbar urethra stricture . A collaborative multi-institutional study derive data Trauma Urologic Reconstruction Network Surgeons , network twelve reconstructive urology center United States , would allow investigator achieve require sample size within 2-3 year . The result study ultimately advance research effort urethral stricture management provide substantial evidence utilization ventral versus dorsal buccal placement reconstructive urologist .</detailed_description>
