	<brief_summary>The goal translational research study evaluate efficacy feasibility balance recovery train on-site fall prevention exercise intervention older adult live retirement community . Falls lead cause injury injury-related death among old adult age 65 United States . While generally accept exercise help prevent fall , exercise always reduce number fall , remain unclear type exercise effective preventing fall . Balance recovery training ( BRT ) novel exercise intervention potential decrease number fall among old adult improve balance recovery ability common balance perturbation trip . BRT involve repeatedly exposing individual postural perturbation safe , control setting allows reactive balance recovery practice improve . The investigator administer BRT on-site continue care retirement community four week old adult faller determine effect balance recovery ability follow six month compare another group old adult faller perform Tai Chi alternative exercise intervention . To address potential BRT translate typical practice within retirement community , investigator also collect data facilitator barrier long-term sustainability BRT retirement community use qualitative method . These quantitative ( balance recovery ability ) qualitative ( implementation process ) measure provide basis subsequent large practical clinical trial test effectiveness BRT reduce number fall among old adult .</brief_summary>
