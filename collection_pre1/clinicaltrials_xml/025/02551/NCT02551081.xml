	<detailed_description>Neonatal congenital malformation one frequent cause infant death western world major city China . There many different type congenital malformation , cause change gene mutation . Next generation sequencing ( NGS ) high-throughput parallel sequence provide genetic information high accuracy . It faster cost-effective method detect gene mutation compare Sanger sequence . We hope couple genomic technique traditional method involve genetic discovery order investigate broad range condition strong evidence genetic factor involve . So In study , evaluate clinical role NGS test neonatal genetic disease newborn compare Sanger sequence observe whether new technology significantly shorten time examination , improve diagnosis rate , guide intervention treatment promote prognosis . These neonate undiagnosed illness , partial family , eligible participate study . The study population recruit Children 's Hospital Fudan University inpatient population , primarily neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) , subpopulation presenting hospital China . All affect study participant receive genetic screening accord clinical symptom . All subject blood draw DNA isolation genomic sequencing time enrollment study . All blood sample volume adhere Fudan procedure maximum blood pediatric patient . In addition , cerebrospinal fluid tissue sample may collect store bank biosamples . DNA isolate prepared NGS Sanger Fudan protocols Translational Medicine Center Children 's Hospital Fudan University . Partial familial sample also obtain , nucleic acid also sequence , indicate , assist diagnosis genetic disease newborn . All sequence data store Genome Center Biorepository . In case positive study finding may diagnostic , investigator perform confirmatory clinical diagnostic testing , confirm , standard clinical diagnostic report place patient 's medical record . Follow patient 's family guide clinical care team . Both molecular diagnosis result duration diagnosis record primary outcome . In addition , information help alleviate anxiety part family , also provide mechanism patient crossover rapid NGS arm patient clinically deteriorate , clinical care team 's request . Each time study participant enrol , clinician parent ask fill survey prior NGS test return result . We also review patient 's medical record collect clinical variable include laboratory testing , radiology result , medication treatment receive analyze effect NGS clinical care . So ultimate goal individualize personalized therapy . We plan follow family annually 18 month post enrollment record clinical outcome relate study .</detailed_description>
