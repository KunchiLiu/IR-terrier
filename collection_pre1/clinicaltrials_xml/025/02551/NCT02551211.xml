	<brief_summary>With recent approval Nivolumab second-line treatment stage IIIb/IV non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) , immune checkpoint inhibitor enter standard care lung cancer . Other immune checkpoint inhibitor evaluation , resectable non-resectable NSCLC . In order refine use molecule , comprehensive data immune contexture NSCLC need . Moreover , blood marker contexture would allow physician monitor immune status patient 's tumor though evaluate rightful place immunotherapy multimodal treatment NSCLC . No blood marker validate far . The LYMPHOLUNG study investigate concordance blood intratumoral count immune cell resectable stage I IIIA NSCLC . By use 30-marker cytometry , precise immune profile NSCLC depict . The prognostic value circulate intra-tumoral T regulator total lymphocyte ratio 2-year recurrence-free survival also address .</brief_summary>
