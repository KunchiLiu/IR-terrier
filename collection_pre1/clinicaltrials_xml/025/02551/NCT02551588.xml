	<brief_summary>Aortic valve stenosis ( AVS ) frequent valvular disease . The severity obstruction leave ventricle ( LV ) essentially analyze today echocardiography Doppler , assess two key marker aortic valve pressure gradient aortic valve area . however marker poor reflect clinical severity AVS . The aim study validate new marker assess cardiac fibrosis might best complementary marker .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Valvular Aortic Stenosis : Study Myocardiac Fibrosis Magnetic Resonance Imagery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To validate new marker assess cardiac fibrosis three group subject study control subject patient AVS order : 1 . Analyze myocardial fibrosis marker MRI , degree hypertrophy , remodel wall shear stress control population three group subject RA progressively increase risk : asymptomatic subject without symptomatic subject LV dysfunction , symptomatic patient LV dysfunction . The factor favor appearance fibrosis observe MRI analyzed subject . 2 . To validate fibrosis marker estimate MRI histological analysis biopsy perform patient undergo aortic valve replacement . 3 . Monitoring compliance distribution marker fibrosis wall stress estimate Initial MRI factor aggravation improve function / remodel remote myocardial . Public hospital Paris</detailed_description>
