	<brief_title>CSL Behring Sclero XIII</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase II , double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled study investigate pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , safety efficacy intravenous factor XIII treatment patient systemic sclerosis . Scleroderma ( Systemic sclerosis ) multisystem rheumatic disease characterise progressive vascular damage e.g Raynaud 's phenomenon digital ulcer organ fibrosis e.g . skin thicken pulmonary fibrosis.The disease associate significant morbidity mortality current therapeutic option partially effective , include Cyclophosphamide skin lung fibrosis Bosentan reduce heal digital ulcer . There cure available therefore high need new therapeutic options.Administration human Factor XIII ( FXIII ) concentrate patient scleroderma demonstrate promising result 1980s 1990s . However study perform accord current Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) guideline involve relatively small sample size . This single site study , therefore study participant see Royal Free London National Health Service ( NHS ) Foundation Trust.Total study duration 36 month involve 2 phase : initial single dose , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) phase 8 subject 6 week multiple dose , active treatment phase 18 subject 24 week . During treatment phase subject randomize 2:1 ratio either FXIII Placebo receive biweekly injection either factor XIII Concentrate placebo .</detailed_description>
