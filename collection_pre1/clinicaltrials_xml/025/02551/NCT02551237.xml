	<detailed_description>Colorectal cancer one frequent cancer diagnose France . The average age diagnosis 2012 70 year old men 73 year woman , confirm colorectal cancer disease elderly population . The literature concern combined treatment colorectal cancer elderly extremely limited . The application combine treatment geriatric population associate increase therapeutic complication . These post-operative complication together comorbidities age unfavorable prognostic factor survival patient cancer rectum ; explain improved result obtain last decade perceptible young patient elderly . In general population , pre-operative radio-chemotherapy imposed standard treatment cancer rectum locally advance . The utilization fluoropyrimidines associate radiotherapy ( RT ) deliver fraction [ long course RT ( 50 Gy 5 week ) , surgery plan 6 8 week later ] increase complete histological response rate decrease significantly rate local relapse . The short-course RT [ short course RT use Swedish model ( 5x5 Gy 5 day ) , surgery program follow week ] standard neoadjuvant protocol important number country and/or academic group . The study compare fraction RT scheme short-course RT protocol show evidence change efficacy short course RT concern follow criterion : rate R0 resection , rate sphincter conservation , rate relapse 3 year , disease free survival overall survival . Similarly , appear difference severe toxicity long term . It however note short-course RT follow immediate surgery may less efficient combine treatment patient distal T3 cancer , even though conclusion publish Ngan criticize certain . On hand , fraction combined treatment result tumor stage reduction thus sterilization . Nevertheless retrospective analysis , perform Stockholm region , patient irradiate short-course protocol operate delay least 4 week result sterilization rate 8 % . This result even interest since cohort , 46 % patient tumor classify T4 38 % patient primitive tumor consider inoperable . In elderly population , neoadjuvant treatment rarely study . An exploratory analysis PRODIGE 2 study , base age criterion , show pre-operative radio-chemotherapy significantly toxic elderly population , 70 year age . Globally low tolerance pre-operative radio-chemotherapy result frequent early termination RT statistically significant decrease number patient operate . Furthermore , type surgery significantly different patient &lt; 70 year ≥70 year , observe non-significant increase rate prolong stoma ( patient amputate without closure stoma ) . These difference surgical procedure also observe publication , place emphasis fact absence difference clinical presentation characteristic tumor , risk real suppose decompensation modifies surgical care . These data , well literature , provide evidence pre-operative radio-chemotherapy strategy follow surgery , standard strategy young patient , associate side effect elderly , result benefit-risk balance , population , questionable . It therefore necessary conduct specific study elderly population , cancer rectum objective maintain carcinological result obtain classical radio-chemotherapy time well control secondary effect treatment risk decompensation patient : short course radiotherapy associate delay surgery may therapeutic scheme well adapt population . The investigator therefore propose study compare pre-operative radio-chemotherapy ( RT + capecitabine ) short course RT associate delay surgery , two primary objective : efficacy evaluation ( rate R0 resection ) preservation autonomy ( score IADL ) .</detailed_description>
