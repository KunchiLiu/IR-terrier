	<detailed_description>Background Significance : The purpose research proposal evaluate effect cycle versus continuous neuromodulator program overactive bladder syndrome . s.In 1997 , Federal Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve sacral nerve stimulator treatment refractory urge incontinence . Sacral Neuromodulation work via stimulation sacral nerve root 2-4 , ( S-2 , S-3 S-4 ) , although exact mechanism action unknown . While implanted electronic stimulators use increasingly last twenty year , little investigation document actual programming stimulator . Prospective trial examine ideal programming parameter specific condition need well identify optimal use sacral nerve modulation therapy . In brief , woman overactive bladder refractory treatment eligible trial placement neuromodulator . The modulators place two stage ; stage one , temporary lead place 3rd sacral foramen . Each neuromodulator 4 electrode place via single lead 3rd sacral foramen . The patient generally return clinic one week follow stage 1 post-op evaluation . If patient report 50 % improvement frequency measure 3-day voiding diary , modulator permanently implant . This stage 2 . After placement , modulator program recovery room . Patients trialed four set program stimulator . Each program differs electrode combination , pulse width , amplitude rate well direction current . Each four program test patient determine felt patient perineum comfortable . Finally , patient either modulator set cycle continuous mode . Currently , decision regard programming make whoever assess patient data driven . Typically , cycle mean neuromodulator stimulation 16 second &amp; 8 second . Continuous mean patient receives constant stimulation . A single retrospective study describe program parameter program modulator treatment Over Active Bladder ( OAB ) . It describe 67 patient good response neuromodulation , determine mean pulse width 204 microsecond , pulse width range 120-270 microsecond ; average rate 9 range 2-20 pulses/second . The majority woman cycle mode . Program cycling purport decrease incidence patient report modulator longer work think extend battery life . No study investigate whether cycle stimulator improve patient outcome . Our objective compare patient outcomes use validated symptom measure OAB woman set cycle versus continuous program . Investigators propose perform randomize crossover study woman successfully treat neuromodulation either continuous cycle mode compare difference group OAB-q SF symptom questionnaire . The investigator also compare difference urinary frequency pad count woman randomize cycle versus continuous stimulation use void diary . Specific Aims Objectives : Aim # 1 : To compare OAB improvement measure Overactive Bladder Questionnaire Short Form Symptom questionnaire ( OAB-q SF symptom questionnaire ) woman continuous versus cycle stimulation neuromodulator . Hypothesis # 1 : Investigators hypothesize woman cycle program report high OAB-q SF symptom score woman continuous program . Aim # 2 : To compare urinary frequency record 3 day void diary woman place continuous versus cycle stimulation neuromodulator . Hypothesis # 2 : Investigators hypothesize woman cycle program report less urinary frequency measure 3 day void diary woman continuous program . Aim # 3 : To compare pad usage woman cycle program versus continuous program . Hypothesis # 3 : Investigators hypothesize woman cycle program report less pad use woman cycle program . Methods : The investigator conduct double-blinded crossover randomize control clinical trial . Up 50 woman need recruit order randomize twenty-three woman successful Stage 1 implant neuromodulator . After write consent , clinical data collect questionnaire administer . After successful Stage 1 placement woman complete 3-day voiding diary . The recording symptom completion void diary standard care woman undergo neuromodulation treatment . These data collect record . Randomization occur successful Stage 2 implantation . Study personnel otherwise involved patient care assign . Randomization assignment random number table permutated block four , ensure equal number woman assign group . Assignments keep sealed opaque envelope open sequential order woman undergone successful Stage 2 implantation . Study personnel program modulator implantation either program modulator continuous cycling program . Patients blind randomization assignment . Prior 3 month visit , study subject complete another voiding diary . At visit , woman complete OAB-q SFsymptom questionnaire well Patient Global Impression Improvement ( PGI-I ) . At visit , woman assign continuous stimulation switch cycle stimulation woman assign cycle stimulation switch continuous stimulation . Women report clinical follow-up six month . Women ask complete void diary . At clinic visit woman complete OAB-q SF symptom questionnaire PGI-I Investigators obtain write consent qualify patient . Patients randomize Cycling Continuous mode Stage II implantation . Statistics : Analysis : Descriptive statistic use describe patient characteristic . The analysis change OAB-q SF score 2 group , 2 period ( 2x2 ) crossover design repeat measure ( RM ) Analyses Variance ( ANOVA ) treatment group ( cycle versus continuous ) period ( first treatment versus second treatment ) repeat factor . The possibility cross effect account analysis order effect covariate ( equal 1 cycling first 0 . ) Analysis urinary incontinence episode pad count record 3 day void diary analyze repeated measure Poisson regression . ( Using SAS 's PROC GEN MOD Poisson distribution ) Significance set p = 0.05 . Power analysis : In cross randomize controlled trial investigator assume clinically important difference change OAB-q SF score woman continuous versus cycle stimulation , standard deviation pair difference 15 point group alpha error 0.05 power 80 % , 20 woman need randomized equal group . ( Hintze , J ( 2011 ) PASS11 . NCSS , LLC &lt; Kaysville Utah , US . www.ncss.com ) ( 9 ) , Assuming 15 % woman lose follow-up investigator need randomize 23 woman study . 2 . Expected outcome : This randomize control trial demonstrate woman cycle program mode report high OAB-q SF Symptom score , report less urinary frequency less pad usage measure 3-day voiding diary .</detailed_description>
