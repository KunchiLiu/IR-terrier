	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study feasibility choose treatment base high throughput ex vivo drug sensitivity assay combination mutation analysis patient acute leukemia returned period improvement respond treatment . A high throughput screen assay test many different drug individually combination kill leukemia cell tiny chamber time . High throughput drug sensitivity assay mutation analysis may help guide choice effective individual 's acute leukemia .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High Throughput Drug Sensitivity Assay Genomics- Guided Treatment Patients With Relapsed Refractory Acute Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To test patient cell high throughput assay individual drug drug combination within 21 day enable optimal choice drug combination therapy . II . To test gene expression reveals activation druggable pathway mutation gene confer susceptibility specific agent may also consider choice treatment . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate response choose therapy . OUTLINE : Leukemia cell obtain blood bone marrow analyzed sensitivity individual drug drug combination via high throughput chemotherapy sensitivity assay next generation sequence assay . Doctors recommend chemotherapy regimen base result . After completion chemotherapy regimen , patient follow 2-4 week response , every 3 month 2 year duration response survival .</detailed_description>
