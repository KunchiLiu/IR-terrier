	<brief_summary>This exploratory study develop image platform assessment whole lung neutrophil retention . The primary objective study quantify compare neutrophil retention lung lipopolysaccharide-challenged healthy subject , saline-challenged healthy subject subject stable COPD . There two treatment group , one healthy subject subject stable COPD . The total duration study healthy subject approximately 1 week , addition screen window 28 day . The total duration study subject COPD approximately 1 week complete Visit 1 , approximately 2 week subject COPD return unit Visit 2 7-10 day later , addition screen window 28 day .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Group 1 : Healthy subject Between 45 75 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . Healthy determine investigator medically qualify designee base medical evaluation include medical history , physical examination , laboratory test cardiac monitoring : A subject clinical abnormality laboratory parameter ( ) is/are specifically list inclusion exclusion criterion , outside reference range population study may include investigator consultation Medical Monitor require agree document find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . A subject wellcontrolled hypertension , noninsulin dependent diabetes well control medical condition may include investigator , consultation Medical Monitor require , agree document find unlikely introduce additional risk factor interfere study procedure . Subjects must stable current treatment least one month prior first image visit . Current nonsmoker use tobacco product 6month period precede screen visit pack history le 5 pack year . Pack year = ( cigarette per day smoked/20 ) x number year smoke ) Body weight &gt; =50 kilogram ( kg ) body mass index ( BMI ) within range 1930 kg/meter ( ) ^2 ( inclusive ) . Males . A female subject eligible participate pregnant ( confirm negative human chorionic gonadotrophin ( hCG ) test ) , lactate , non reproductive potential define : Premenopausal females one following : Documented tubal ligation , Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure followup confirmation bilateral tubal occlusion , Hysterectomy , Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy . Postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea ( questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) estradiol level consistent menopause ( refer laboratory reference range confirmatory level ) . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one highly effective contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrolment . Capable give sign informed consent include compliance requirement restriction list consent form protocol . Group 2 : COPD patient Between 45 75 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . Stable stage 23 COPD patient , accordance definition GOLD guideline , 2014 force expiratory volume one second ( FEV1 ) &gt; =40 % predict .

Subjects positive Hepatitis C antibody due prior resolve disease enrol , confirmatory negative Hepatitis C ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) test obtain . A positive prestudy smoking/drug/alcohol screen . A positive test human immunodeficiency virus antibody . Where participation study would result donation blood blood product excess 500 mL within 56 day period . The subject participate clinical trial receive investigational product within following time period prior first image visit current study : 30 day , 5 halflives twice duration biological effect investigational product ( whichever longer ) . Exposure four new chemical entity within 12 month prior first image visit . Previous exposure ionise radiation background ( e.g . work research study ) , combine estimate exposure dose give study , result exposure 10Milisievert ( mSv ) three year period . Clinical ( therapeutic diagnostic ) exposures involve patient benefit include calculation .
