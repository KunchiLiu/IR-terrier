	<detailed_description>Background Recent oversea randomize control trial proven effectiveness lower clinic home BP uncontrolled hypertensive patient teach perform home BP monitoring properly validate BP device . Patients taught response home BP reading ( e.g . follow drug regime , doctor adjust drug accord patient ' home BP record ) Study design 1 . Prospective cluster randomize control trial , 2 . Qualitative individual interview Aims The investigator aim compare provide validate home BP device , follow group education self-management hypertension well self-BP monitoring appropriate medication response home BP reading , follow nurse follow usual care , may possibly improve old adult uncontrolled hypertension drug adherence , therefore improve BP level primary care set .
