	<brief_summary>Pulmonary arterial hypertension ( PAH ) involve narrow blood vessel connect within lung . Focal adhesion kinase ( FAK ) focal adhesion-associated protein kinase involve cellular adhesion spread process lead stiffen thicken blood vessel lung . This increase blood pressure within lung impairs blood flow . This study aim demonstrate biodistribution FAK inhibitor , GSK2256098 , cardiopulmonary site i.e . heart lung tissue . The uptake 11C-radiolabelled GSK2256098 within lung / heart healthy subject idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension ( iPAH ) patient assess use Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) . Based study result decision whether follow-on phase 2 trial initiate investigate therapeutic utility GSK2256098 iPAH decide . Sufficient number subject screen ( 30 day prior scan ) enrol 12 healthy subject 12 PAH patient study . Enrolled subject receive microdose [ 11C ] -GSK2256098 scan day follow follow-up visit ( 2-4 week post-last dose ) .</brief_summary>
