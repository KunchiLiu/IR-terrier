	<brief_summary>The incidence rectal cancer 15,000 new case per year France 10 15 % locally advanced ( T4bNxM0 ) moment diagnosis . The rate invade resection margin ( R1 ) locally advance fixed rectal tumour vary 10 20 % . The invasion resection margin triple risk local recurrence . In absence surgical treatment , 5-year survival rate patient pelvic recurrence rectal cancer lower 4 % whereas vary 35 40 % case curative resection . The care management locally advance fixed rectal tumour pelvic recurrence rectal cancer constitutes , therefore , absence recommendation , difficult therapeutic problem great variability method care management around world . These variation practice explain structural organizational difference , well cultural dissimilarity .
