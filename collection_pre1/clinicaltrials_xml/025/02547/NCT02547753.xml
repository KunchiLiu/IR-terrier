	<brief_summary>The literature rich study explore type frequency oral abnormality transplant recipient , scarce study provide scientific evidence risk complication invasive intervention patient . Within context , aim study evaluate post-exodontic socket repair kidney transplant recipient compare control group see indicator population transplant people ( complete blood count , cluster differentiation 4 ( CD4+ ) level , serum concentration immunosuppressive drug ) help provide host response face invasive procedure . Therefore , 30 kidney transplant recipient six month 30 healthy non immunosuppressed adult submit maximum 3 simple extraction , always surgeon . Laboratory test evaluate preoperatively include : blood count coagulation - group - urea , creatinine , CD4+ cluster differentiation 8 ( CD8+ ) lymphocytes T serum level immunosuppressive drug - study group . Researchers evaluate patient postoperative 3 , 7 , 21 , 30 60 day . The presence , absence , post-exodontic complication delay , , socket repair result interest study compare group . The data evaluate ANOVA , chi-square . Logistic regression analysis use evaluate influence modify factor smoke presence diabetes .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Evaluation Alveolar Wound Repair After Dental Extraction Kidney Transplanted Recipients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Investigators find scientific evidence neither evidence-based research , support idea stable kidney recipient increase risk delay socket repair wound heal exodontia infection result oral surgery common patient , despite drug-induced immunosuppression use . Since scientific evidence increase risk post-exodontic infection , even disorder alveolar repair chronology , exodontia perform kidney recipient , aim study prospectively observe kidney recipient undergoing dental extraction . This prospective cohort study involve 30 adult kidney recipient least 6 month , 30 non-transplanted healthy control adult , need simple extraction erupt tooth . All patient must evaluate preoperative phase anamnesis ( e.g . collect data concern base disease , personal history , presence drug allergy , medication use , habit addiction ) , extra-oral intra-oral physical examination laboratory test . Participants must sign Inform Clarified Consent Term participate . Will disqualify participant : use antibiotic month precede extraction , make bisphosphonate therapy , user illicit drug , chronic alcoholic , present dental emergency , acute dental periodontal infection , patient cognitive impairment . One week dental extraction collect 15ml blood participant group perform complete blood count , coagulation test , urea creatinine measurement , CD4 CD8 Lymphocytes T cell quantification . The serum measurement immunosuppressed drug perform individual study group . Dental extraction , one three erupt teeth , perform dentist , specialist Oral Maxillofacial Surgery , enable Federal Council Dentistry , ambulatory CAPE ( special care center ) , local anesthesia follow standard describe Peterson et al ( 2003 ) . The local anesthetic use individual prilocaine epinephrine vasoconstrictor . After anesthetic blockade , incision mucosal detachment , luxation elevator tooth removal forceps perform . The surgical technique modify accord condition tooth socket ; necessary tooth section and/or ostectomy perform . By end , curettage socket , post-extraction alveolar compression reduce width simple suture 4.0 silk thread carry . Each tooth characteristic surgery data record include : surgical duration ( anesthesia suture ) , surgical technique variation , use elevator , forceps , mucoperiosteal flap , tooth section and/or ostectomy intraligamentary anesthesia , number anesthetic cartridge use . After surgery , patient press gauze 30 minute extraction ` region order control bleeding . It prescribe 750 mg Acetominophen , 3 time day , 24 hour . In case necessity change postoperative therapeutic due surgical technique variation , data record include . Clinical assessment heal perform blind examiner 3 , 7 , 21 , 30 , 60 day surgery . In period , region always examine examiner . Radiographic evaluation do standardized periapical radiograph , individualized positioner , make immediately , 30 60 day postoperative , bone density alveolar crest remodel evaluate blinded examiner . At 60 day postoperative , repair classify : 1 ) without complication ; 2 ) complication . According Cheung et al ( 2001 ) , follow situation consider post-exodontics complication : Acutely infect socket — pain , redness , swell , pu discharge systemic fever Acutely inflame socket — painful socket exuberant inflame tissue , without pus systemic fever Dry socket — persistent throb pain exposure bare alveolar bone . In case postoperatively infection , copious irrigation sodium chloride solution ( NaCl 0,9 % ) perform prescribed amoxicilline 500 mg every 8 hour 7 day anti-inflammatory nimesulide 100 mg every 12 hour 5 day . In case allergy penicillin , clindamycin prescribe dose 300 mg every 8 hour 7 day . The second outcome interest study observe total alveolar epithelialization . According literature , 3 day postoperative , socket fill blood clot fibrin ; 7 day , socket fill granulation tissue ; 21 day surgical wind fully epithelialized . Delayed epithelialization consider case day 21 , socket would yet fully cover epithelialized mucosa . Finally , third point bone deposition socket , 60 day postoperative . All data transfer Excel spreadsheet analyze descriptively associate . Complications compare two group . In addition , study group , researcher investigate occurrence complication associate transplantation time , CD4 CD8 lymphocytes blood count data , immunosuppressive dose , presence comorbidity , diabetes . Exact Fisher ` test applied , analysis variance , Mann-Whitney ` test use R software , version 2.15.3 ( R Development Core Team , 2012 ) . The significance level set 5 % . Adjustments modify factor smoke presence diabetes analyze logistic regression .</detailed_description>
