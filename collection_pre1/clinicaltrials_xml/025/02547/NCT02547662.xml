	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well pomalidomide , ixazomib citrate , dexamethasone work treat patient previously treat multiple myeloma plasma cell leukemia . Biological therapy , pomalidomide dexamethasone , use substance make live organism may stimulate suppress immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Ixazomib citrate may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving pomalidomide , ixazomib citrate , dexamethasone together may effective treat multiple myeloma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pomalidomide , Ixazomib Citrate , Dexamethasone Treating Patients With Previously Treated Multiple Myeloma Plasma Cell Leukemia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine confirm response rate ( &gt; = partial response [ PR ] ) ixazomib citrate ( ixazomib ) , use combination pomalidomide dexamethasone patient previously treat multiple myeloma ( MM ) extramedullary disease . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine toxicity associate ixazomib combination pomalidomide dexamethasone patient previously treat MM extramedullary disease . II . To determine differential response rate ( biochemical versus extramedullary disease ) ixazomib combination pomalidomide dexamethasone patient previously treat MM extramedullary disease . III . To determine progression free survival follow treatment ixazomib combination pomalidomide dexamethasone patient previously treat MM extramedullary disease . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess proportion patient achieve minimal residual disease ( MRD ) negative status . OUTLINE : Patients receive ixazomib citrate orally ( PO ) day 1 , 8 15 , pomalidomide PO day 1-21 , dexamethasone PO day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
