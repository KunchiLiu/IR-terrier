Female subject nonchildbearing potential may enrol study . Nonchildbearing potential define premenarche , hysterectomy , ovariectomy postmenopause . Female subject childbearing potential may enrol study , subject : practiced adequate contraception 30 day prior vaccination , negative pregnancy test day vaccination , agree continue adequate contraception entire treatment period 2 month completion vaccination series . applicable Step 1 A male female , include , 18 40 year age time Screening Visit . Healthy subject without acute chronic , clinically significant pulmonary , cardiovascular , hepatic renal functional abnormality , determine physical examination laboratory screen test . applicable Step 2 A male female , include , 50 70 year age time screen visit . Subjects without medical history , clinical find laboratory find opinion investigator could pose safety concern interfere protocol . Current former smoker cigarette smoke history ≥ 10 packyears . applicable Step 1 Step 2 Use investigational nonregistered product study vaccine within 30 day precede first dose study vaccine , plan use study period . Concurrently participate another clinical study , time study period , subject expose investigational noninvestigational vaccine/product . Previous vaccination vaccine contain NTHi and/or Mcat antigen . Chronic administration ( defined 14 day total ) immunosuppressant immunemodifying drug within 6 month prior first vaccine dose . For corticosteroid , mean prednisone ≥20 mg/day , equivalent . Only topical steroid allow . Administration longacting immunemodifying drug time study period . Administration immunoglobulins and/or blood product within 3 month precede first dose study vaccine plan administration study period . Any confirm suspected immunosuppressive immunodeficient condition , base medical history physical examination . History current autoimmune disease . Acute disease and/or fever time enrolment . Fever define temperature &gt; = 37.5°C oral axillary route . The preferred route record temperature study oral . Subjects minor illness without fever may , enrol discretion investigator . Current alcoholism and/or drug abuse . History current condition prevent intramuscular injection bleed coagulation disorder . Malignancies within previous 5 year lymphoproliferative disorder . Pregnant lactate female . Female plan become pregnant planning discontinue contraceptive precaution . Any condition investigator judge may interfere study finding . applicable Step 1 Planned administration/ administration vaccine foreseen study protocol period start 30 day first dose end 30 day last dose vaccine , exception influenza vaccine may administer ≥ 15 day precede follow study vaccine dose . Laboratory evidence clinically significant haematological ( complete blood cell count [ RBC , WBC ] , WBC differential count [ lymphocytes , neutrophil eosinophils ] , platelet count haemoglobin level ) biochemical ( alanine aminotransferase [ ALT ] , aspartate aminotransferase [ AST ] creatinine ) abnormalities per opinion investigator . applicable Step 2 Planned administration/ administration vaccine foreseen study protocol period start 30 day first dose end 30 day last dose vaccine , exception influenza pneumococcal license vaccine may administer ≥ 15 day precede follow study vaccine dose . Postbronchodilator FEV1 &lt; 80 % predict normal value . Diagnosed respiratory disorder ( e.g . asthma , COPD , sarcoidosis , tuberculosis , bronchiectasis , lung fibrosis , pulmonary embolism , pneumothorax , physician confirm lung cancer ) . Please note subject mild pulmonary obstruction ( i.e . FEV1/ FVC ratio &lt; 0.7 FEV1 ≥ 80 % normal predict value [ GOLD grade 1 ] ) enrol . Has contraindication spirometry testing ( recent eye surgery , recent thoracic abdominal surgery procedure , unstable cardiovascular status , recent myocardial infection pulmonary embolism ) . Laboratory evidence clinically significant haematological ( complete blood cell count [ RBC , WBC ] , WBC differential count [ lymphocytes , neutrophil eosinophils ] , platelet count haemoglobin level ) biochemical ( ALT , AST creatinine ) abnormality . Has significant disease , opinion investigator , likely interfere study and/or likely cause death within study duration .</criteria>
