	<brief_summary>Heart failure remain major cause morbidity mortality . Many patient heart failure receive support leave ventricular assist device ( LVAD ) point course disease . Some LVAD patient experience durable recovery ventricular unload LVAD , may associate inhibition inflammatory cytokine . This small pilot study aim determine biologic clinical efficacy interleukin-1 receptor antagonist ( Anakinra ) induce myocardial recovery patient support left ventricular assist device .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist Treatment Heart Failure Patients With Left Ventricular Assist Devices</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>More 5 million Americans heart failure , number expect increase 25 % year 2030 . Fifty percent individual diagnose heart failure die within 5 year diagnosis . Of patient currently heart failure , 5-10 % Stage D disease , require specialize intervention chronic inotropic support , mechanical circulatory support , transplantation . Transplantation consider curative heart failure , 2,200 heart transplant take place year . Due imbalance donor possible recipient , large number patient remain could benefit transplantation never receive heart . Many patient receive leave ventricular assist device ( LVADs ) support fail heart , increase chance survival wait undergo transplantation . It show 19 % patient show durable echocardiographic recovery ( measure leave ventricular ejection fraction &gt; 40 % ) ventricular unload LVAD . Recovery mediate unload LVAD cause several change molecular level . However , mechanism underlie recovery cellular level , also know reverse remodeling , recently study . Thus , window opportunity develop adjuvant treatment enhance recovery opening . Interestingly , patient experience durable echocardiographic recovery high circulating level anti-inflammatory cytokine . Inhibition inflammatory cytokine , use receptor antagonists inflammation-associated cytokine like Anakinra , also show reduce adverse myocardial remodel ischemic event increase exercise activity patient systolic heart failure . This study propose exogenous administration Anakinra end-stage heart failure patient support LVADs effort increase number patient experience recovery magnitude recovery . While small trial aim primarily demonstrate biologic efficacy Anakinra , clinical efficacy study also investigate . Encouraging result pilot study may prompt creation randomize , control trial design demonstrate efficacy functional clinical standpoint .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>To qualify inclusion , patient must meet following criterion : age &gt; 18 year date LVAD implantation require circulatory support LVAD either bridgetotransplant destination therapy indication . They must also judge implant surgeon expect survival trial completion ( approximately 6 month implantation ) , without regard likelihood cardiac transplantation . Exclusion criterion include presence Right Ventricular Assist Device , biventricular support associate decrease survival outcome could negatively impact attrition rate course study . Additional exclusion criterion include inability patient train caregiver administer study drug , inability patient complete study questionnaire . Patients creatinine clearance &lt; 30 mL/min , evidence active infection , immunosuppression , allergy E. Coli derive product also exclude . Last , patient dependence inflammatory modulate drug exclude .</criteria>
