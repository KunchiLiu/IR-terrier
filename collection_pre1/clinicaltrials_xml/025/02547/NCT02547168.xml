	<brief_summary>Lung resection pulmonary malignancy offer best chance survival patient , procedure carry significant burden post-operative morbidity mortality . Patients particularly high risk post-operative atrial fibrillation ( condition involve irregular heart rhythm ) . Atrial fibrillation symptom increase risk stroke - blockage major blood vessel brain , potentially result disability even death . The objective study establish feasibility use ambulatory heart rate monitoring determine total incidence atrial fibrillation peri-operative period anatomic lung resection malignancy . The study also investigate correlation atrial fibrillation rate stroke adverse event , well serve identify patient higher risk develop atrial fibrillation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Determining True Incidence Atrial Fibrillation Before After Lung Resection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Novel literature suggest atrial fibrillation asymptomatic may problematic atrial fibrillation present symptom . The objective study establish feasibility track total incidence atrial fibrillation peri-operative period , include symptomatic asymptomatic event , use ambulatory heart monitor . Additionally , study aim estimate overall incidence peri- post-operative atrial fibrillation . These accomplished usage iRhythm ZIO XT , small pebble shaped device adhere patient 's chest 14 day surgery , measure often atrial fibrillation occurs .</detailed_description>
