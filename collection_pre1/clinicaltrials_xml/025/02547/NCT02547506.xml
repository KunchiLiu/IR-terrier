	<brief_summary>The central goal propose study generate essential pilot data necessary support establish line research lead future extramural grant submission . The aims current study two-fold : 1 ) compare cardiorespiratory fitness ( CRF ) gait endurance across three group people : ( 1 ) individual Parkinson Disease ( PD ) participate box regular basis , ( 2 ) individual PD participate exercise box regular basis ( 3 ) healthy control age exercise regular basis 2 ) examine relationship CRF motor symptom PD ( bradykinesia , tremor postural instability ) . Forty-five participant ( 15 group ) participate exercise regular basis ( least 120 minute exercise per week past 3 month ) recruit cross-sectional study . In single testing session , participant perform follow test : ( 1 ) clinical performance measure ( 2 ) CRF assessment . A one-way ANOVA appropriate post hoc test use examine difference dependent variable across three exercise group . Relationships CRF clinical performance measure evaluate Pearson 's correlation coefficient .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>All participant include study must age 55 75 Be able ambulate independently without physical assistance , assistive device , low extremity orthosis Be able follow least 3step verbal command Participate communitybased group exercise program Be classify regular exerciser participate 120 minute per week least 3 month And physician 's consent undergo grade exercise test ( GXT ) . Furthermore , participant identify low moderate risk cardiovascular disease base ACSM 's risk stratification guideline include study . Participants two PD group must diagnosis idiopathic PD Have HoehnYahr score 1 , 2 , 3 And either participate regularly box training Rock Steady Boxing participate another communitybased group exercise program regular basis , classify 120 minute per week least 3 month . Participants may include study surgery past 6 month Current musculoskeletal complication health issue influence walking . The participant without disability involve study preexist neurological condition . Participants PD involve study preexist neurological condition idiopathic PD ( e.g . diagnosis Parkinson Plus syndrome ) , past brain surgery implantation deep brain stimulator .</criteria>
