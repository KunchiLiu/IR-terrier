	<brief_summary>This pilot study aim evaluate effectiveness , safety , cost-utility chlorhexidine gluconate ( CHG ) -soaked cloths compare mupirocin ointment exit site usual care ( normal saline ) aseptic technique prevention PD-related infection . It pilot study , double-blind , stratify randomize control trial . Participants randomize three arm mupirocin , usual care , CHG-soaked cloth ratio 1:1:1 . They follow 1,3,6,9 , 12 month PD-related infection , catheter removal , death . The primary outcome PD-related infection . Secondary outcome safety , adverse event related treatment skin irritation , rash etc . Other outcomes hospitalization due PD-related infection , technical failure , change modal dialysis , adherence medication , death due PD-related infection . Costs include provider patient expense . Utility assess use EuroQol ( EQ ) , five-dimensional ( 5D ) , five-level ( 5L ) version . The result study anticipate nephrologists health care professional involve PD decision making plan prevent PD-related infection . In addition , result lead clinical guideline development prevention PD-related infection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chlorhexidine Gluconate Versus Mupirocin Ointment Prevention Peritoneal Dialysis-Related Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peritoneal dialysis ( PD ) one renal replacement therapy use end-stage renal disease . Since 2011 , increase number patient `` PD First '' policy Thai government . The common PD related complication PD-related infection categorize PD-related peritonitis , exit site tunnel infection . Although possible treat PD-related infection , incidence technical failure , death due peritonitis still high Thailand . PD-related infection mainly cause Staphylococcus aureus . To prevent PD-related infection , clean aseptic solvent use aseptic technique prevent infection prescribe prophylactic antibiotic recommend . The International Society Peritoneal Dialysis ( ISPD ) recommend position statement regular use mupirocin ointment around catheter exit point apply nasal cavity . However , rise concern long term use mupirocin mupirocin resistance S. aureus . CHG antiseptic use clinical practice . It coat least 12 hour skin anti-bacterial covered gram negative positive . Several meta-analysis study show effectiveness CHG prevention hospital infection i.e . reduce catheter-related sepsis , postoperative infection , microbial resistance . According PD-related infection , CHG little evidence effectiveness . This pilot study aim evaluate effectiveness , safety , cost-utility CHG-soaked cloth compare mupirocin ointment exit site usual care ( normal saline povidone-iodine ) aseptic technique prevention PD-related infection . It pilot study , double-blind , stratify randomize control trial . Participants randomize three arm mupirocin , usual care , CHG-soaked cloth . They follow 1,3,6,9 , 12 month PD-related infection , catheter removal , death . The primary outcome PD-related infection . Secondary outcome safety , adverse event related treatment . Other outcomes hospitalization due PD-related infection , technical failure , change modal dialysis , adherence medication , death due PD-related infection . Costs include provider patient expense . Utility assess use EQ-5D-5L .</detailed_description>
