	<brief_title>Does Spinal Anesthesia Prolapse Surgery With Lead Urinary Retention ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A randomized trial compare urinary retention rate spinal general anesthesia woman undergo outpatient pelvic organ prolapse surgery concomitant incontinence surgery . Randomization Randomization do pre-operative area , day surgery . Computer generate randomization do block 4 . Sealed numbered envelope open prior surgery subject assign spinal general anesthesia . Patient randomization day surgery discuss anesthesia thought randomize day would safe . Preoperatively Subjects ask complete validated questionnaire , Quality Recovery 15 ( QoR-15 ) prior surgery , preoperative visit . Anesthesia Subjects randomize general anesthesia receive propofol induction , combination muscle relaxant inhalational gas per anesthesia standard care investigator ' institution . Subjects randomize spinal anesthesia receive Bupivacaine 0.75 % , 8-12 mg dose depend estimate duration surgery anesthesiologist decision . In addition spinal anesthesia , subject possibly concurrent administration fentanyl , midazolam , propofol mildy sedate sleep . Voiding Trial A void trial perform PACU subject able stand ambulate bathroom . Voiding trial consist remove vaginal packing back fill bladder 300cc saline less subject urgency small bladder capacity . A void trial consider successful subject void least 2/3 total volume instill bladder scan showing le 1/3 remain . If subject unable void hour , additional hour permit . However , 2 hour bladder backfilled subject still unable void , Foley replace subject discharge home Foley leg bag leg bag teaching . An office nurse call subject schedule office nurse visit remove Foley post-operative day number 5 7 . If subject go home Foley consider acute POUR . Follow Up Subjects receive phone call either nurse fellow , 48 72 hour post-operatively make sure symptom urinary retention , well complication . A telephone survey administer follow phone call use validated questionnaire , QoR-15 . They receive copy survey refer time hospital discharge . Subjects admit hospital follow , include phone call 48 72 hour surgery , include validated questionnaire , QoR-15 . In addition , subject 6 week follow visit clinic ask complete QoR-15 .</detailed_description>
