	<brief_title>Impact Anxiety Cardiac Substrate Modification Women With Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Catheter Ablation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : High level anxiety promote remodel cardiac substrate via persistent inflammation , result increase prevalence leave atrial scar non-pulmonary vein ( non-PV ) trigger woman AF . Rationale : Anxiety generally define psycho-biological emotional state reaction consist unpleasant feeling tension , apprehension , nervousness , worry , activation autonomic nervous system . This disorder typically common woman men . There considerable evidence suggest close interaction anxiety inflammation inflammation AF . Earlier study document strong association anxiety inflammation show high level inflammatory biomarkers C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , total white blood cell ( TWBC ) count , fibrinogen interleukin-6 patient anxiety . Chronic inflammation result structural remodel atrial architecture fibrotic change support genesis perpetuation AF . In cardiac fibrosis , myocytes coupled fibroblast undergo early depolarization result increase ectopic beat repetitive fire lead origin non-pulmonary vein ( non-PV ) driver . Left atrial scar another know consequence cardiac fibrosis . Therefore , prudent hypothesize high level anxiety prolonged period result structural remodel cardiac substrate evidence increased prevalence leave atrial scar non-PV trigger female patient paroxysmal persistent AF . Scar non-PV trigger know independent predictor arrhythmia recurrence AF patient undergo catheter ablation . Recurrences AF , despite complete PV disconnection , strongly suggest important possible role focus serve source persistence arrhythmia . Altered conduction barrier result atrial scar form critical circuit intra-atrial re-entry promotes AF persistence . Recent progress technology knowledge provide well understanding allowed electrophysiologists improve ablation procedure order make safe effective . However , still score unanswered question relatively young research domain , one anxiety impact cardiac substrate remodel potentially influence ablation-outcome . Also , note , anxiety affect patient perceive illness , particularly woman , influence healthcare utilization economic burden . Therefore , role anxiety would ascertain , timely intervention would lead improvement success rate ablation therapy females highly dominate subset AF population . Study Design : This pilot study prospectively enroll 152 consent female patient undergo catheter ablation AF . Eligible patient enrol sign informed consent , approve Institutional Review Board participate institution .</detailed_description>
