	<brief_summary>This prospective , single-blinded , randomized-controlled study compare new method ( slump-sitting ) conventional method ( forward erect bend ) perform lumbar spine flexion X-rays .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Slump Sitting X-ray Lumbar Spine Is Better Than Conventional Flexion View</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Power calculation perform base preliminary pilot result use clinically set difference 10 degree ( SD 15 degree ) change mean global lumbar spine flexion sit stand posture . An estimated sample population 100 patient deem necessary study fulfill statistical power 90 % two-sided 5 % significance level . Block randomization every 4 subject perform begin study ensure equal number subject study arm comparison result conceal envelope . During clinical consult , history take perform per usual clinic visit . Specific patient 's detail include age , occupation , presence severity back pain , presence severity leg pain , neurological symptom document . Physical examination perform accordingly parameter clinical range motion lumbar spine , neurological sign provocative test record later analysis . For flexion radiograph , new conventional method perform patient . These picture make chart visually display . They serve instructional manual patient radioimaging process , reinforce verbal instruction on-duty radiographer . Both image do X-ray beam project patient 's leave distance 100cm patient . The central beam direct estimate centre L3 , T11 vertebral body mid-body sacrum serve superior inferior limit respectively . A single extension view lumbar spine also perform flexion view . All radiograph store Digital Imaging Communications Medicine ( DICOM ) format view Centricity Enterprise Web V3.0 ( 8.0.1400.128 ) assessment . Measurements do 2 independent reviewer average reading record . Both reviewer blind method flexion X-rays take . Interim data analysis plan 30th patient 60th patient . During time point , primary objective look mean global lumbar spine flexion sit stand posture assess . All collect data measurement tabulate use Microsoft Excel 2011 ( Version 14.0 ( 32-bit ) ) analyze use International Business Machines ( IBM ) Statistical Package Social Sciences ( SPSS Version 23.0 ) . For main analysis global segmental lumbar flexion , well measure displacement obtain two flexion method , pair t-test employed . There requirement follow patient study . The whole study complete within 1 year recruitment</detailed_description>
