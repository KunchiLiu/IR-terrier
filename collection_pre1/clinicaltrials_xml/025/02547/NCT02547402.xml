	<brief_title>A Study PK Interaction CXA-10 With Pravastatin Vytorin® Healthy Males</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This exploratory study small , well control group healthy subject explore effect CXA-10 pravastatin Vytorin® ( combination simvastatin ezetimibe ) . The overall design trial administer drug metabolize transporter quantify impact CXA-10 may exposure drug . The study also examine 24-h urine total creatinine excretion prior follow administration CXA-10 examine effect CXA-10 , , either directly creatinine transporter enhance creatinine production . To reduce potential variability drug exposure level , study population include male subject 19 25 year age .</detailed_description>
