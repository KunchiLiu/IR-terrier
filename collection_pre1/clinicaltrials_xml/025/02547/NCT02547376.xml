	<brief_summary>Soft tissue sarcoma ( STSs ) rare group cancer arise 'soft ' tissue commonly involve muscle , fat nerve . Even follow surgery radiotherapy 50 % tumour recur spread present , reliable test allow doctor predict patient occur . DNA inside cell ( cell-free cfDNA ) present small quantity circulate blood . In cancer patient cfDNA come cancer cell . Analysis cancer-derived cfDNA patient cancer show quantity characteristic cfDNA change stage disease treatment . The researcher plan investigate abundance persistence cancer-derived cfDNA STS patient various stage disease investigate potential role characteristic biomarkers . Selection genetic character track patient ' cfDNA important consideration . An establish hallmark cancer cell ability undergo unlimited number cell division . In normal human cell protective structure end chromosome call telomere provide mechanism limit number time healthy cell divide . This limitation overcome cancer cell tumour form . This occur activation one two telomere maintenance mechanism ( TMM ) - either enzyme call Telomerase mechanism know Alternative Lengthening Telomeres ( ALT ) . In many sarcomas activation either TMM associate genetic change ( mutation ) small number gene . As mutation present normal cell mark essential feature cancer cell ( capacity unlimited cell division ) likely reliable marker presence STS cell . The investigator plan develop sensitive , quantitative assay detect TMM associate mutation tumour derive cfDNA blood patient STSs , track mutation overtime . They establish amount cancer-derived cfDNA STS patient time surgery , persistence cfDNA follow visit follow tumour resection event local tumour recurrence spread ( metastatic disease ) . Once basic parameter establish analysis broaden include gene commonly mutate STSs view identify genetic characteristic may also aid identification patient high risk recurrence spread . In summary assay describe facilitate well monitoring patient STS , allow earlier treatment STS recur follow surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aims The investigator plan 2 year pilot observational study : - Identify quantify circulate cell-fee DNA ( cfDNA ) case Soft Tissue Sarcoma ( STS ) - Investigate Telomere Maintenance Mechanisms ( TMM ) STSs . - Use TMM associate genetic mutation identify quantify tumour-derived cfDNA STSs time tumour resection throughout follow - Track tumour derive cfDNA characteristic time correlate clinical outcome identify potential STS biomarkers Hypotheses Based finding cancer hypothesise plasma cfDNA detectable case STS . Given key role telomere length maintenance play cancer cell development investigator also hypothesise TMM associate mutation present tumour derive cfDNA , act stable marker STS tissue , therefore increase concentration local recurrence metastatic disease occur . Tumour derive cfDNA identification In month 0-3 sensitive assay target know tumour-specific mutation develop . Using retrospectively collect tissue investigator verify cfDNA detect ( quantify ) plasma patient STSs . Analysis TMMs STS tissue In month 3-12 tumour sample every prospectively recruit sample analyse establish TMM activated STSs . Telomerase ALT activity assess publish laboratory technique . Quantification characterisation TMM associate mutation / tumour derive cfDNA In month 10-12 quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction base assay develop identify TMM associated mutation find prevalent STSs . In month 12-22 assay use identify quantify TMM associate mutation ( therefore also tumour-derived cfDNA ) plasma sample take every prospectively recruit patient time surgery throughout follow . Correlation cfDNA characteristic clinical outcome In month 22-24 cfDNA concentration , tumour-derived cfDNA concentration genetic characteristic correlate clinical outcome measure include local recurrence , metastatic recurrence death determine characteristic ' potential future biomarkers . Patient recruitment / sample collection Patients recruit East Midlands Sarcoma Service . Samples already available collect 2 source verify cfDNA detect STSs : Firstly 20 patient metastatic disease ask give consent retrospective analysis tumour tissue already archive follow histological analysis . One blood sample also collect patient analysis . Secondly every STS sample already store Nottingham Health Science Biobank , ( Nottingham City Hospital ) accompany plasma sample also store ( 15 time write ) analyse . For investigator remain analysis month 0-22 patient non-metastatic high-grade STSs undergoing plan resection locally approach participate . 2013 figure suggest 100 patient eligible inclusion . Tumour tissue , blood , unaffected muscle saliva ( 2 source control DNA ) collect time resection . Repeat blood sample collect 3 monthly end recruitment .</detailed_description>
