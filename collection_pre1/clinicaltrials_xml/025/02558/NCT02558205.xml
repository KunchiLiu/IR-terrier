	<brief_summary>The purpose study see possible establish relationship blood flow blood volume liver tumor CT body perfusion radiation dose deposit tumor radioembolization treatment measure PET/CT . The study : 1 . Measuring blood flow blood volume tumor image data CT body perfusion 2 . Measuring radioactivity tumor radioembolization treatment use PET/CT calculate dose deposit tumor 3 . Using statistical analysis ass relationship dose perfusion parameter In addition , research may help develop method calculate dose radioembolization deliver liver tumor ( ) use blood volume blood flow data obtain CT body perfusion scan .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The overreach goal line research establish methodology produce patient tumor specific treatment plan Yttrium-90 radioembolization hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . The propose project facilitate collection preliminary data support large study fully establish relationship tumor perfusion parameter deliver radiation dose . Y-90 radioembolization delivers million small resin glass bead attach contain ( depend product ) beta emit radioisotope Yttrium . These bead inject patient 's hepatic artery interventional radiology procedure . The bead push hepatic vasculature system pulsatile flow eventually become lodged , due finite size , microvasculature liver tumor deliver radiation dose high energy beta particle ( average energy 0.94 MeV ) release radioactive decay ( half life 64 hour ) highly local ( ~2.5 mm range ) manner . The bead permanently embed vasculature radioactivity eventually decay background . Current practice calculate deliver average liver lobe radiation dose base either lobar volume patient 's body surface area . However , hypervascular nature HCC lesion , tumor receive great proportion bead healthy liver parenchyma hence assume receive radiation dos well calculated average liver dose dose normal liver . Due differ vascularity characteristic tumor patient , Y-90 treatment deliver dose tumor . A less vascular tumor may receive substantially less radiation vascular one affect tumoricidal efficacy treatment ultimately patient 's final outcome . New technique use Positron Emission Tomography ( PET ) /CT follow Y-90 treatment allow retrospective dosimetry determine actual dose deliver tumor . However , methodology exists plan dose delivered tumor prior treatment . This research aim collect preliminary data begin establish prospective method use Computed Tomography ( CT ) perfusion study liver calculate expect dose HCC lesion normal liver base blood flow blood volume . This goal achieve prospectively collect CT Perfusion study prior Y-90 radioembolization treatment PET/CT immediately follow treatment . The relationship perfusion parameter represent vascularity lesion normal liver post treatment PET/CT dosimetry establish line research . The hypothesized correlation perfusion parameter tumor dose establish PET/CT allow patient tumor specific treatment planning ensure appropriate tumoricidal radiation dose reliably deliver .</detailed_description>
