	<detailed_description>Objective : The goal study examine in-vivo effect intraocular ( IOP ) intracranial pressure ( ICP ) optic nerve head ( ONH ) . Specific Aims : In study , investigator quantify structural change ONH subject elevate ICP treat reduce elevated pressure . This process occur stepwise fashion period time determined clinical treatment plan . The investigator apply control pressure eye step ICP lower OCT image obtain . Background : The effect ICP eye health area concrete research effort recent year . The ability acquire non-invasive highly detailed information eye brain use technology magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) pave way ass non-invasively effect ICP in-vivo . The ONH separate two pressurized compartment : eyeball central nervous system . Situations ICP elevate often associate papilledema , though magnitude rate change ONH elevation response increase ICP reduction ONH elevation response ICP treatment yet determine . On opposite side , glaucoma lead cause blindness elevate IOP lead risk factor , clinical evidence suggest presence ICP normal level subject . The impaired balance IOP ICP lead deformation ONH , trigger strangulation retinal ganglion cell axon trespass lamina cribrosa within ONH way eye brain , lead gradual axonal loss irreversible visual impairment . Significance : Little known interaction IOP ICP pressure change affect macrostructure microstructure optic nerve head structure . This information significant impact neurosurgical condition elevate ICP along ocular condition glaucoma papilledema . The ability gauge non-invasively change ICP tremendous impact neurosurgical management eliminates need longitudinal invasive measurement ICP . The study also improve investigator 's understanding pathophysiologic process lead development glaucoma well response treatment subject papilledema . A good understanding process ultimately lead improve detection management condition well understand ocular bio-mechanics .</detailed_description>
