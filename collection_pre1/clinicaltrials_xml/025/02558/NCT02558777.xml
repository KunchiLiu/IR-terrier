	<brief_summary>Objectives : To analyze multicomponent nurse-led intervention randomize clinical trial ( MID-Nurse Study ) feasible ( Pilot study ) , reduce incidence , duration , severity delirium hospitalize old adult AGU . Design : Parallel-group Double-blind Randomized Clinical Trial ( Pilot Study ) . Setting : AGU `` Complejo Hospitalario Universitario Albacete '' ( Albacete , Spain ) . Participants : 50 patient ≥ 65 year hospitalize AGU ( 21 intervention group , 29 control group ) . Interventions : After risk factor analysis , participant intervention group ( IG ) receive daily multicomponent intervention ( orientation , sensorial deficit , sleep , mobilization , hydration , nutrition , drug , elimination , oxygenation , pain ) intervention nurse . The control group ( CG ) receive usual care . Measurements : Delirium presence determine daily Confusion Assessment Method ( CAM ) , delirium severity Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 ( DRS ) . Mortality , day hospitalization , use physical restraint measure , use drug delirium control ( neuroleptic benzodiacepines ) also record .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Multicomponent Nurse Intervention Reduce Delirium Hospitalized Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Parallel-group , double blind ( evaluation analysis ) , randomize clinical trial ( pilot study ) . The design base recommendation conduct pilot study ( Thabane 2010 ) . The main objective MID-Nurse ( Randomized Clinical Trial ) analyze multicomponent nurse-led intervention reduces incidence , duration , severity delirium hospitalize old adult Acute Geriatric Unit ( AGU ) . Specific objective evaluate criterion MID-Nurse-P ( Pilot Study ) : - Process : To determine recruitment rate ( criterion : least 70 % eligible patient recruit ) , complete follow-up rate ( criterion : least 85 % include participant complete follow-up ) , adherence intervention ( criterion : least 80 % include participant receive every scheduled intervention ) . - Resources : To assess capacity team process time conduct trial . Criteria : Less 10 % participant can´t complete intervention program due study team problem , daily time employ per participant longer 30 minute . - Management : To analyze potential study personnel data manage problem . - Scientific : To estimate intervention effect variance . In first 24 hour admission , follow data collect evaluation nurse , informed consent sign , randomization perform principal investigator , take part rest data collection clinical intervention : Demographic data , Charlson comorbidity index , mean clinical diagnosis admission , usually consume drug admission , Barthel index , Holden´s FAC instrument , Pfeiffer´s Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire , Reisberg´s Global Deterioration Scale , Dowton scale , pain visual analogical scale , pressure ulcer risk Braden scale . Vital sign determine admission , include blood pressure , heart rate , temperature , hydration level , oxygen saturation . Medical nurse procedure record , include bladder catheterization , nasogastric tube placement , venous arterial access , blood sample acquisition , invasive procedure . Blood sample collect , haemoglobin , leukocyte neutrophil count , reactive C protein , sedimentation rate , glucose , urea , sodium , potassium , albumin , total protein , cholesterol , thyroid stimulate hormone , transferrin , ferritin , total iron , folic acid , B12 vitamin , record . After patient enrollment , patient receive daily evaluation Confusion Assessment Method scale ( CAM ) ( Inouye 1990 ) evaluation nurse , afternoon . Prevalence delirium throughout follow-up described , prevalence exclude first day ( avoid bias patient admitted confusion ) , incidence delirium ( new case across follow-up , one patient could 1 incident delirium ) . Number day delirium also register , mean number day delirium calculate group . In case CAM positive delirium , patient also evaluate Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 ( DRS-R-98 ) ( de Rooij 2006 ) determine delirium severity . Total delirium severity calculate add severity delirium day hospitalization , mean severity per day calculate divide global severity per number day delirium . Main outcome variable presence delirium throughout follow-up ( dichotomic variable , yes/no ) , number day delirium hospitalization ( continuous variable ) , total delirium severity ( sum DRS-R-98 complete follow-up ) . Participants intervention group receive first intervention first 24 hour admission , thereafter daily hospital discharge . Participants control group receive usual medical nurse care hospitalization process . The intervention carry exclusively `` intervention nurse '' , compose two main part , first one risk factor analysis , second one intervention risk factor detect ( orientation , sensorial deficit , sleep , mobilization , hydration , nutrition , drug , elimination , oxygenation , pain ) . Furthermore , intervention nurse identify principal caregiver first 24 hour admission , provide informative booklet strategy recommendation prevent delirium incidence , include ambient strategy , orientation ability , identification alert sign .</detailed_description>
