	<detailed_description>Goals present study determine whether initiate pelvic floor muscle train preoperatively improve quality life symptom relate specifically urinary health follow robot-assisted radical prostatectomy . Drawing definitive conclusion past study challenge secondary various inconsistency include : variability physical therapy intervention , poorly define definition continence , well poorly define quality life measurement . Additionally , vast majority study combine open robotic prostatectomy increase cohort heterogeneity blur interpretation result . The investigator ' study focus exclusively patient undergo robot-assisted radical prostatectomy . Standardized pelvic floor muscle therapy well clearly define patient outcome ( ie : validated questionnaire ) utilized determine whether preoperative initiation formal pelvic floor physical therapy improve health-related quality life follow surgery . In era robot-assisted radical prostatectomy physical therapist initiate preoperative pelvic floor muscle training lessen expect postoperative drop urinary related quality life and/or improve patient 's recovery continence follow surgery ?</detailed_description>
