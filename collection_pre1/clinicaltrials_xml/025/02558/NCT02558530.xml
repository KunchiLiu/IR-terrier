	<brief_summary>The major adverse health consequence obesity occur non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) also develop . NAFLD characterize abnormal hepatic accumulation triglyceride lipid . The first-line approach NAFLD management caloric restriction weight loss , remain difficult achieve . Little attention give dietary carbohydrate restriction , despite recent report show hepatic de novo lipogenesis , process convert dietary carbohydrate fatty acid postprandial state , account approximately 25 % liver triglyceride content hyperinsulinemic subject NAFLD . For comparison , 15 % liver triglycerides derive dietary fatty acid patient NAFLD consume standardized 30 % fat diet four day assess .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>To establish time-course hepatic fat loss NAFLD subject carbohydrate-restricted diet ( &lt; 20 g/day ) , serial assessment liver fat two week diet perform . Also , marker lipid insulin metabolism , liver function test change gut microbiota rapid metabolic improvement assess . The overall aim exploit unique set human material determine specific cellular molecular pathway modify early stage metabolic improvement fatty liver regression .</detailed_description>
