	<brief_summary>This study design prospective evaluation diagnostic performance multiplex nucleic acid-based genetic test ( Gynecologene Next-Generation Sequencing test ) identify know significant causative organism bacterial vaginosis/vaginitis major pathogen normal commensal symptomatic woman reproductive year . Vaginal fluid sample split test comparator method Nugent score , result evaluate accord sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value . Laboratorians perform test blind clinical history prior test result minimize ascertainment bias . Each subject follow routinely 6 week initial visit vaginosis/vaginitis telephone office visit discretion treat physician .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Diagnosing Bacterial Vaginosis/Vaginitis ( BV ) Using Gynecologene Test Method</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bacterial vaginosis ( BV , vaginal bacteriosis ) vaginitis common vaginal infection woman child-bearing year , BV alone account 27-41 % 1 prevalence Americans . BV characterize replacement healthy lactobacillus-dominant microbiome diverse polymicrobial overgrowth multiple taxon commensal facultative anaerobe pathogenic bacteria . Molecular-based phylogenetic analysis , include newly-completed Human Microbiome Project next-generations sequence ( NGS ) study , reveal complexity vaginal microbiome health disease . BV appear single entity , rather consist multiple bacterial community cluster . Clusters dominate Lactobacillus iners , Lactobacillus crispatus , anaerobic combination without Lactobacillus spp . ( specie ) vary proportion . In addition , multiple significant BV-associated pathogen discover escaped notice detection method culture ; previously overlook Atopobium vagina , Lactobacillus iners Lactobacillus spp. , multiple Lachnospiraceae spp ( Bacterial Vaginosis Associated 1 , Bacterial Vaginosis Associated 2 , Bacterial Vaginosis Associated 3 ; BVA1 , BVA2 BVA 3 respectively ) . This multisite study propose evaluate sensitivity specificity Gynecologene Next-Generation Sequencing test woman symptoms vaginitis/vaginosis . To investigator ' knowledge , Gynecologene first commercially-available comprehensive NGS-based laboratory-developed test available assist diagnosis clinical management BV . This multisite site study compare diagnostic performance Gynecologene Next-Generation Sequencing test clinical diagnosis bacterial vaginosis/vaginitis ( Nugent score ) . The second objective compare sensitivity specificity Gynecologene Score Nugent Score diagnosis bacterial vaginosis/vaginitis . The third objective identify prevalence diagnostic threshold bacterial load Gynecologene test . Women 18-55 year age eligible study diagnose bacterial vaginosis vaginitis confirm use CDC ( Centers Disease Control ) diagnostic gold standard Nugent score ; Amsel criterion also record . Other inclusion well exclusion criterion exist . A minimum 5 geographically different site enrol study . Co-investigators follow protocol enroll participant collect 2 vaginal swab 1 slide smear . The patient financial gain responsibility within protocol . Overall , study 90 % power significance level 0.05 detect ± 5 % positive percent agreement study device predicate device . To achieve level power , 100 total sample assay per group account withdrawal treatment failure . Samples contain one target organism count twice analysis organism independent . The provision treatment , include type , dose , duration , solely discretion clinician accord his/her current routine procedure reflect typical contemporary practice . AIBiotech serve central medical diagnostic laboratory trial . Results analytical test provide Principal Investigator . Data analysis blind patient identification PHI ( protect health information ) study administrator . Data analyze report .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Women ≥ 18 year age race ( AfricanAmerican , Hispanic , Asian/Pacific Islander , native American , white ) . Women reproductive year prior menopause case age 55 year . Signed Informed Consent document obtain prior initiation screening procedure . Signs symptoms vaginitis/vaginosis , include vaginal discharge , pruritis , irritation , and/or dyspareunia . Diagnosis bacterial vaginosis ( study group ) accord Nugent score ( see ) ; and/or diagnosis vulvovaginal candidiasis ; and/or diagnosis Trichomonas vaginalis . Clinical Diagnosis : Nugent Score : The presence abnormal vaginal flora initial diagnosis confirm gram stain , subject BV ( bacterial vaginosis bacterial vaginitis ) Nugent score &gt; 7 . Inclusion Criteria Control Group : Study Group , Nugent Score &lt; 7 . No active major medical psychological problem could complicate study participation . Treatment investigational prescription product within 28 day study screen . Postmenopausal great 55 year age . Prior history hysterectomy vaginal surgery . Prior currently active autoimmune disease require management systemic immunosuppression reason . Such condition include inflammatory bowel disease , systemic vasculitis , scleroderma , psoriasis , multiple sclerosis , hemolytic anemia , immunerelated thrombocytopenia , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus , Sjögren 's syndrome , sarcoidosis , rheumatological disease . Any infection require parenteral/ enteral antibiotic therapy cause fever ( body temperature &gt; 100.5°F 38.1°C ) within 4 week prior study screen . Any medical intervention condition , opinion PhysicianInvestigator could compromise adherence study requirement otherwise compromise study subject safety study 's objective .</criteria>
