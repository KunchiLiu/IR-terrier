	<brief_summary>This open label , multicenter , fix dose dose escalation , phase I/II study . The study conduct 2 step . The first one ensure safety combination Obinutuzumab ( GA101 ) Ibrutinib fix dos . A total 9 patient include first step ( step A ) group inclusion three patient ( safety evaluation perform inclusion 3 patient ) . The second step ( step B ) conduct unacceptable toxicity observe first step 24 new patient included step B . The aim second step determine MTD GDC-0199 combination GA101 Ibrutinib ( respect previous dos ) use Continual Reassessment Method .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Obinutuzumab , GDC-0199 Plus Ibrutinib Relapsed/Refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study conduct 2 step respect optimal safety OASIS trial : Step A : The primary objective step A evaluate safety combination GA101 + Ibrutinib fix dos ( 560 mg per day Ibrutinib + 1000 mg GA101 ) , patient relapse refractory Mantle Cell Lymphoma ( MCL ) . Secondary objective : - To describe efficacy combination GA101 Ibrutinib term clinical benefit response ( overall response rate , complete response rate , partial response rate Cheson 99 07 criterion Working Group Revised Response Criteria Malignant Lymphomas 14 ) , overall survival , progression free survival . - To describe safety tolerability combination GA101 Ibrutinib - To establish bio-bank explore biomarkers mechanisms action include resistance Step B : This study perform conditionally observation unacceptable toxicity patient include step A . The primary objective step determine maximal tolerate dose ( MTD ) GDC-0199 addition GA101 Ibrutinib relapse refractory MCL patient use Continual Reassessment Method ( CRM ) . Secondary objective : - To describe efficacy combination GA101 , Ibrutinib GDC-0199 term clinical benefit response ( overall response rate , complete response rate , partial response rate Cheson 99 07 criterion Working Group Revised Response Criteria Malignant Lymphomas 14 ) , overall survival , progression-free survival . - To describe safety tolerability novel combination GDC-0199 , GA101 Ibrutinib - To establish bio-bank explore biomarkers mechanism action include resistance</detailed_description>
