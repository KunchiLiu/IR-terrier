	<brief_title>Phase 1/2a Evaluation AL3818 Subjects With Recurrent Metastatic Endometrial , Ovarian Cervical Cancer ( AL3818-US-001 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 1b/2a study evaluate safety , pharmacokinetics efficacy 21-day cycle AL3818 therapy . The study divide two part . Part 1 ( Phase 1b ) evaluate dose limit toxicity ( DLT ) general safety first 21-day cycle Al3818 therapy reevaluate MTD . It include sequential evaluation 3 subject per cohort 3+3 design 18 subject total . Cohort 1 initiate dose 12 mg/day AL3818 , cycle 14 day treatment follow 7 day rest . After three subject complete first cycle therapy without DLT , additional cohort may enrol sequentially . All subject allow continuation therapy repeat cycle 21-days tolerate AL3818 stable disease well . After first cohort complete one full cycle therapy without DLT , two additional cohort sequentially enrol 16 mg/day 20 mg/day dos AL3818 21-day cycle . Part 2 ( Phase 2a ) evaluate safety preliminary efficacy repeat 21-day cycle AL3818 . It include 45 additional subject metastatic endometrial cancer , ovarian cancer refractory platinum therapy cervical cancer refractory standard therapy . Each subject receive dose 20 mg AL3818 maximum MTD Part 1 ( Phase 1b ) study continuous 21-Day cycle therapy ( 14 day AL3818 treatment follow 7 day ) . All subject Part 1 Part 2 study permit continue therapy safety monitor bimonthly assessment progression , AL3818 well tolerate subject stable disease well .</detailed_description>
