	<brief_summary>The main objective study evaluate acceptance operate flow , performance safety AQrate Robotic Assisted System spinal fusion surgery</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>New Robotic Assistance System Spinal Fusion Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Based literature review similar device pre-clinical test perform AQrate System bench cadaver , study build around follow hypothesis : 1 . The design principle operation AQrate System permit correct integration surgical procedure flow thus enable surgeon benefit advantage generate additional operational difficulty 2 . The stability ease use device permit surgeon achieve plan spinal fusion without require additional assistance medical staff compare conventional spinal fusion surgery . 3 . A spinal fusion surgery procedure perform use AQrate System similar conventional spinal fusion surgery . If correctly use , additional adverse event observe . 4 . The exposure x-ray decrease need intraoperative recheck pedicle screw place reduced 5 . The precision placement pedicle screw adversely affect use system compare conventional spinal surgery .</detailed_description>
