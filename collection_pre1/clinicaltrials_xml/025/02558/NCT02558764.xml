	<brief_summary>Advances surgical technique immunosuppression ( IS ) lead appreciable reduction postoperative complication follow kidney transplantation . However , surgical site event ( SSE ) include surgical site infection ( SSI ) wound complication still common limit improve outcome result prolonged hospitalization , hospital readmission reoperation , consequently increase overall transplant cost . Negative pressure wound therapy ( NPWT ) concept introduce initially assist treatment chronic open wound . This technique use negative pressure unit specific dressing help hold incision edge together , redistribute lateral tension , reduce edema , stimulate perfusion protect surgical site external infectious source . Thus , provide faster wound heal shortens hospital stay . Recently , grow interest use portable NPWT device close incision surgery prevent potential SSI wound complication high-risk patient . Investigations regard technique various surgical setting show reduce risk SSI wound complication . These study conclude patient undergoing transplantation consider 'high-risk ' receive treatment . To date , study report literature explore effect preventive use portable NPWT device surgical wound set organ transplantation . The aim study compare portable NPWT device ( PICO , Smith &amp; Nephew , London UK ) conventional gauze dressing patient undergo kidney transplantation ( KT ) surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients admit transplant surgery inpatient floor cadaveric kidney transplant surgery review circle care team approach consent deem suitable trial . A Nova Scotia Health Authority Research Ethics Board approve inform consent form utilized consent discussion patient provide time read document full ask decision participation . Patients give consent study randomize 'PICO ' 'Control ' group . The randomization process hold time period admission patient inpatient floor referral patient operating room . Randomization process conduct transplant fellow research associate randomly pick envelope box full 60 same-sized , same-colored close envelope time patient give consent . Among 60 envelope 30 'PICO ' card inside , remain 30 envelope 'control ' card . Assignment process complete 30 consecutive patient include group . There 1 control per case . For patient group surgical wound closure procedure : At end cadaveric kidney transplant procedure wound edge approximate mean run subcuticular suture non-absorbable stitch ( 3/0 polypropylene/polyethylene ) . For patient randomize 'PICO ' group , PICO apply operate room immediately closure continuous negative pressure set -80 mmHg . For patient randomize control group standard care basic wound contact absorbent dressing apply operate room immediately closure surgical wound . Follow-up care : Control Group patient surgical site dress change sterilely wet , remove 48 hour post op . At time wound leave exposed complication occur . PICO group patient keep device place 7 day , remove post-operative day 7 . PICO Dressing replacement perform case dress becomes wet day 7 . All patient receive antibiotic prophylaxis 60 minute surgery per routine protocol : Cefazolin ( 1-2 gram ) IV give first-choice antibiotic . Clindamycin ( 600-900 mg ) IV give penicillin-allergic patient . Data regard follow parameter collect recipient : Age time transplant surgery , gender , diabetic status , pre-transplant dialysis status ( preemptive/hemodialysis/peritoneal dialysis ) , body mass index/ pre-transplant weight , pre-operative serum albumin level , Human Leukocyte Antigen ( HLA ) mismatch status , panel reactive antibody ( PRA ) , functional status graft ( immediate graft function / delay graft function ) in-hospital stay . Following variable regard KT surgery allograft collect : Date KT surgery , donor age , cadaveric donor type ( brain death/cardiac death ) , cold ischemia time , warm ischemia time operative time . SSE evaluate post-operative day 3 , 7 30 . Data minor major wound complication ( superficial wound dehiscence , evisceration , seromas , incisional hernia , wound infection wound necrosis ) collect first 30 postoperative day record follow-up form researcher . These data include information regard type wound complication , whether intervention require type number intervention ( therapeutic vacuum-assisted closure , percutaneous drainage re-operation ) . PICO conventional dressing ( control ) group compare term afore-mentioned `` wound complication risk factor '' descriptive `` recipient , donor allograft '' parameter . Subsequently , investigator plan proceed comparison outcome among two group . Statistical analysis method describe used comparison group term rate wind complication wound complication-related intervention re-operation rate . 8 . STATISTICAL ANALYSIS A ) Power calculation There 1 control assign per case . Prior data indicate failure ( wound complication ) rate among control 0.25 . Findings previous study regard preventive PICO application correspond true relative risk 2.5 . Relevant power calculation analysis suggest assignment 26 experimental 26 control subject ( ( able reject null hypothesis relative risk equal 1 probability ( power ) 0.8 ) ) . The Type I error probability associate test null hypothesis 0.05 . An uncorrected chi-squared statistic use evaluate null hypothesis . B ) Analysis data Results express mean ± standard deviation . Categorical data compare use 2-tailed Fisher 's exact test Chi-squared test . Continuous variable compare use Mann-Whitney test . p &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant . Statistical analysis perform computer software ( SAS Windows , version 9.2 ) .</detailed_description>
