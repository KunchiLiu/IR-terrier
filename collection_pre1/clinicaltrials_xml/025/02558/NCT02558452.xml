	<brief_title>European Transplant Registry Senior Renal Transplant Recipients Advagraf</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose registry establish data long-term outcome elderly renal transplant recipient receive initial standard immunosuppression tacrolimus daily , mycophenolate steroid The objective registry investigate long-term course renal transplantation elderly European population ( ≥65 year ) immunosuppression tacrolimus daily , mycophenolate steroid order well define risk factor patient death graft loss predictor favourable outcome grow population . For purpose , SENIOR transplant registry implement collect data graft loss , death , renal function , quality life biopsy proven acute rejection ( BPAR ) , analyze common complication severe infection , opportunistic infection ( CMV and/or BKV viremia ) , malignancy , cardiovascular event , hospitalisation large population European senior renal allograft recipient . In addition , type severity rejection ( Banff-grade , steroid resistant rejection , antibody-mediated rejection , antibody-treated rejection , recurrent rejection ) , development circulate donor specific antibody ( DSA ) , cardiovascular risk factor ( diabetes , development posttransplant diabetes ( PTDM ) , hypertension ) , renal function ( estimate CKD-EPI ) , proteinuria longitudinally assess parallel immunosuppressive dos drug level . The registry focus common side effect immunosuppressive therapy ( leucopenia , anemia ) , treatment pattern reason treatment change . Finally , prospective analysis quality life include burden medication elderly transplant recipient plan . All recipient ( ≥65 year ) kidney transplant willing participate European SENIOR-Registry may enter registry prior transplantation fulfil in- none exclusion criterion receive intend initial immunosuppression consist tacrolimus daily ( Advagraf , initially adjust trough blood level ≥5ng/ml ) , mycophenolate ( either ≥1.0g/day Mycophenolate Mofetil ( MMF ) ≥720mg/d enteric-coated Mycophenolate Sodium ( EC-MPS ) ) Steroids . There 12 study visit 10 year period . Except quality life questionnaire study specific procedure plan . Only data record anyway recorded clinical routine . The study population consist representative group approximately 1000 senior ( ≥65 year ) kidney transplant patient , receive renal allograft initial standard triple immunosuppression ( tacrolimus daily ( Advagraf ) , mycophenolate ( either ≥1.0g/day Mycophenolate Mofetil ( MMF ) ≥720mg/d enteric-coated Mycophenolate Sodium ( EC-MPS ) ) steroid . The patient recruit approximately 42 transplant center Europe .</detailed_description>
