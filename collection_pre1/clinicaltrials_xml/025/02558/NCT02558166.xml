	<brief_summary>This study consist two substudies . The first substudy : 'Renal resistive index critically ill patient cardiogenic septic shock ' Design : cross-sectional observational Aim project : 1. determine whether critically ill patient cardiogenic septic shock elevate Renal Resistive Index 2. determine whether Renal Resistive Index differs cardiogenic/hypovolemic shock shock due sepsis/systemic inflammation ( SIRS ) 3. determine relation ( change ) renal vascular resistance - Markers systemic - microcirculation - Fluid status quantify bioimpedance analysis - Concomitant renal function The second substudy : 'Predictive value Renal Resistive Index ICU admission course development acute kidney injury critically ill patient cardiogenic septic shock ' Design : longitudinal observational The aim project : 1. determine whether renal resistance index admission intensive care unit predict development acute kidney injury ( AKI ) critically ill patient shock 2. investigate renal resistance index admission intensive care unit independent predictor development AKI depend severity duration shock know risk factor AKI comorbidity use nephrotoxic drug Aim large research project determine whether Renal Resistive Index could become monitoring tool intervention study aim prevent acute kidney injury protect kidney .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute Kidney Injury ( AKI ) severe complication develop intensive care patient result hypovolemic , cardiogenic septic shock . It define abrupt decrease kidney function . It encompass direct injury kidney well acute impairment function , include decrease glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) . Its prevention crucial AKI increase morbidity mortality ( 1 ) . Mechanisms comprise ischemia/reperfusion , oxidative stress , inflammation toxicity ( 2 ) .The common pathophysiological pathway include endothelial damage microvessels lead impaired macro- microvascular flow aggravate ischemia ( 3 ) . Up , much controversy exist - change renal blood flow different kind shock - relation renal blood flow , glomerular filtration rate development AKI - relation renal blood flow marker systemic microcirculation In prospective observational study , three study measurement perform two group critically ill patient ( shock shock ) . 1 . The Renal Resistive Index ( RRI ) determine use Renal Doppler Ultrasound . The renal resistive index ( RRI ) sonographic index assess resistance intrarenal arcuate interlobar artery use assess renal arterial disease . It measure RRI = ( peak systolic velocity - end diastolic velocity ) /peak systolic velocity . The normal value â‰ˆ 0,60 , 0,70 around upper limit normal . 2 . The sublingual microcirculation quantify use side stream dark field imaging ( SDF ) 3 . Fluid status determine Bioelectrical impedance analysis ( BIA ) use Akern device . In addition , routinely measure marker circulation , renal function fluid balance collect analysis .</detailed_description>
