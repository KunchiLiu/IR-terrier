	<brief_summary>Critically ill patient often ventilate dedicated critical care unit provide respiratory support . Despite best practice patient often develop condition call adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ) , characterise deterioration respiratory function , change chest x-ray . The correct management ARDS identify underlying condition cause deterioration identify appropriate target therapy . One cause pneumonia , cause bacterial infection lung ventilate patient . The patient may ventilate due pneumonia may also develop pneumonia whilst ventilate . Ventilator associate pneumonia ( VAP ) significant mortality . Despite clinical laboratory data investigator ' disposal remain great difficulty accurate diagnosis pneumonia therefore treatment often give empirically . Therefore , urgent clinical need accurate method diagnose presence bacteria deep lung ventilate critically ill patient . As , investigate team develop synthesise image agent call BAC ONE . BAC ONE instill directly lungs 12 patient ( without lung infection ) ass whether label bacteria human lung .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Microdosing BAC ONE Distal Lung</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary objective study deliver BAC ONE microdose ventilate control patient lung infection ass image parameter BAC ONE human autofluorescence ass bacteria detect vivo situ within distal lung . The primary endpoint visualise delivery microdose BAC ONE ass image parameter : - 3 mechanically ventilated patient provide control population ( cohort 1 ) - 3 bronchiectasis patient predominant colonisation gram-negative bacteria ( cohort 2 ) - 3 bronchiectasis patient predominant colonisation gram-positive bacteria ( cohort 3 ) - 3 patient suspect pneumonia pulmonary infiltrates ICU ( cohort 4 ) For cohort , eligibility verify clinical trial physician write informed consent obtain . For cohort , bronchoscopy lavage perform harvest broncho-alveolar lavage fluid ( BALF ) . Fibre-based endomicroscopy ( FE ) perform three area 80μg ( ± 25 % ) total BAC ONE instill 3 site . Participants ask provide additional blood urine sample intention examine systemic uptake BAC ONE probe . Routine blood investigation perform 4-6 hour follow administration BAC ONE . All participant either contacted member research team via telephone ward visit 24 hour ( ± 4 hour ) BAC ONE dosing ensure AEs/SAEs experienced . The participant 's involvement study conclude 24 hour assessment successfully complete AEs/SAEs resolve .</detailed_description>
