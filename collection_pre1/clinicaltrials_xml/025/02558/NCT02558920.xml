	<brief_title>Meta-analyses Relation Fructose-Containing Sugars Their Food Sources With Risk Obesity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Sugars emerge one important public health concern . Attention focus squarely fructose-containing sugar ( fructose , sucrose , high fructose corn syrup , honey , etc ) . Collectively , sugar indict driver obesity epidemic downstream cardiometabolic complication . This special view rest unique metabolic endocrine response fructose . Unlike glucose , fructose thought bypass negative feedback control act unregulated substrate de novo lipogenesis impair satiety signal result weight gain . In support mechanism , animal model , low-quality ecological study , select human trial overfeed level exposure far beyond population intake report adverse metabolic effect sugar . Higher level evidence systematic review meta-analyses control trial , however , suggest effect sugar mediate excess calorie rather sugar per se . There also evidence food source sugar associate equally obesity . While sugars-sweetened beverage ( SSBs ) show adverse association body weight , marker adiposity obesity , important food source sugar pure fruit juice , cereal , yogurt , even cakes/sweets show either association beneficial association . It remain unclear whether sugar contribute weight gain increase adiposity independent calorie whether important food source SSBs associate high risk overweight obesity . Need propose research : High quality systematic review meta-analyses control trial prospective cohort study represent high level evidence support dietary guideline public health policy development . As dietary guideline public health policy shift toward food dietary-pattern base recommendation , urgent need systematic review meta-analyses compare role different food source sugar development overweight obesity . Objective : The investigator conduct series American Society Nutrition ( ASN ) -commissioned systematic review meta-analyses ( 1 ) distinguish effect fructose-containing sugar energy body weight marker adiposity control trial ( 2 ) compare different sugar ( total sugar , sucrose , fructose ) food source added/free sugar ( SSBs , pure fruit juice , yoghurt , cereal , cake , pastry , sweet , etc ) association incident overweight/obesity change weight marker adiposity prospective cohort study . Design : Each systematic review meta-analysis conduct accord Cochrane Handbook Systematic Reviews Interventions report accord Preferred Reporting Items Systematic Reviews Meta-Analyses ( PRISMA ) . Data source : MEDLINE , EMBASE , The Cochrane Central Register Controlled Trials ( Clinical Trials ; CENTRAL ) search use appropriate search term supplement hand search reference include study . Study selection : The investigator include either control dietary trial prospective cohort study . Randomized non-randomized controlled trial include &gt; = 2-weeks duration ass effect fructose-containing sugar ( fructose , sucrose , high fructose corn syrup , honey , etc ) incident overweight/obesity , body weight marker adiposity . To allow separation effect sugar energy , 4 trial design consider : ( 1 ) 'substitution ' trial , fructose-containing sugar add food beverage compare macronutrient source ( usually starch sugar ) energy match condition ; ( 2 ) 'addition ' trial , fructose-containing sugar supplement diet excess energy compare diet alone without excess energy ; ( 3 ) 'subtraction ' trial , energy fructose-containing sugar ( usually form sugars-sweetened beverage ) reduce displacing water and/or no-calorie low-calorie sweetener eliminate altogether background diet ; ( 4 ) 'ad libitum ' trial , energy fructose-containing sugar freely replace source energy ( usually complex carbohydrate fat ) without strict control either study food background diet . Prospective cohort study include &gt; = 1-year duration ass relation different sugar ( total sugar , sucrose , fructose ) important food source added/free sugar ( SSBs , pure fruit juice , cakes/sweets , cereal , yoghurt , etc . ) incident overweight/obesity change body weight marker adiposity . Data extraction : Two investigator independently extract relevant data ass risk bias use Cochrane Risk Bias Tool . All disagreement resolve consensus . Standard computation imputation use derive miss variance data . Outcomes : Three set outcomes assess : ( 1 ) incidence overweight/obesity , ( 2 ) measure global adiposity ( body weight , body mass index ( BMI ) , body fat ) , ( 3 ) measure abdominal adiposity ( waist circumference , waist-to-hip ratio ) . Data synthesis : Risk ratio pool incident overweight/obesity mean difference measure global abdominal adiposity use generic inverse variance method . Random-effects model use even absence statistically significant between-study heterogeneity , yield conservative summary effect estimate presence residual heterogeneity . Fixed-effects model use &lt; 5 included study . Paired analyse apply crossover trial . Heterogeneity assess Cochran Q statistic quantify I2 statistic . To explore source heterogeneity , investigator conduct sensitivity analysis , study systematically remove . If &gt; =10 study , investigator also explore source heterogeneity priori subgroup analysis age ( child [ = &lt; 18 year age ] , adult ) , health status ( metabolic syndrome/diabetes , overweight , normal weight ) , comparator , fructose form ( solid , liquid , mixed ) , dose ( = &lt; 10 % energy , &gt; 10 % ) , baseline measurement , randomization , study design ( parallel , crossover ) , energy balance ( positive , neutral , negative ) , follow-up ( = &lt; 8-weeks , &gt; 8-weeks ) , risk bias . Meta-regression analysis assess significance categorical continuous subgroup analysis . When &gt; =10 study available , publication bias investigate inspection funnel plot formal test use Egger Begg test . If publication bias suspect , investigator attempt adjust funnel plot asymmetry impute miss study data use Duval Tweedie trim fill method . Evidence Assessment : The strength evidence outcome assess use Grading Recommendations Assessment , Development Evaluation ( GRADE ) . Knowledge translation plan : The result disseminate interactive presentation local , national , international scientific meeting publication high impact factor journal . Target audience include public health scientific community interest nutrition , diabetes , obesity , cardiovascular disease . Feedback incorporate use improve public health message key area future research define . Applicant/Co-applicant Decision Makers network among opinion leader increase awareness participate directly committee member development future guideline . Significance : The propose project aid knowledge translation relate role dietary fructose-containing sugar important food source sugar development overweight obesity , strengthen evidence-base guideline improve health outcome educate healthcare provider patient , stimulate industry innovation , guide future research design .</detailed_description>
