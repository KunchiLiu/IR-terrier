	<brief_summary>Rationale : Several clinical feasibility study show potential benefit near-infrared fluorescence ( NIRF ) image use indocyanine green ( ICG ) enhance early biliary anatomy visualization laparoscopic cholecystectomy aim reduce number vascular biliary injury . Although incidence injury low ( 0.7 % ) , impact patient term morbidity , quality life cost dramatic . The Critical View Safety ( CVS ) technique regard safety valve conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( CLC ) . It hypothesize standard application near-infrared fluorescence image laparoscopic cholecystectomy useful obtain establishment CVS ( least 5 minute ) early certainty regard visualization compare conventional laparoscopic image alone . Study design : A multicenter randomize control trial two study arm . Patients schedule elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy recruit randomized outpatient clinic ( n = 308 total ) . One group undergo near-infrared fluorescence cholangiography assist laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( NIRF-LC ) group undergo conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( CLC ) . Compared standard care , patient NIRF-LC group receive one preoperative intravenous injection ICG . This additional minimally invasive action patient . Initially , patient participate study benefit application NIRFC surgical procedure . The administration ICG modify laparoscope relate kind additional risk patient . Despite encouraging result several ( pre ) clinical feasibility study , wide clinical acceptance routine use ICG fluorescence laparoscopy still lack due absence reliable validated clinical data . A randomized clinical study desirable assess potential add value NIRF imaging technique laparoscopic cholecystectomy . Strong evidence favor routine implementation new imaging technique laparoscopic cholecystectomy , probably lead worldwide routine application NIRF technique . Therewith long term sustainability research project guarantee .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( LC ) one commonly perform laparoscopic procedure gastrointestinal surgery . Bile duct injury procedure rare constitute serious complication ( 0.3-0.7 % ) ( Flum 2003 , Fletcher 1999 , Nuzzo 2005 Waage 2005 ) . Misidentification extra-hepatic bile duct anatomy laparoscopic cholecystectomy main cause bile duct injury ( Way 2006 ) . The Critical View Safety ( CVS ) technique , first describe Strasberg 1995 ( Strasberg 2003 ) recommend Dutch Guidelines Best Practice laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( Lange 2006 ) , introduce reduce risk bile duct injury . To establish CVS , two window need create : one window cystic artery , cystic duct gallbladder , another window cystic artery , gallbladder liver . The CVS technique especially aim mobilize gallbladder neck liver , order obtain circumferential identification transition cystic duct gallbladder . Intraoperative cholangiography advise reduce risk bile duct injury ( Flum 2003 , Buddinhg 2011 ) . However , radiological image biliary tree use selectively , process take time , radiation exposure involve additional equipment manpower procedure require . Therefore , worldwide consensus implementation intraoperative cholangiography still lack ( Ford 2012 ) . Near-infrared fluorescence ( NIRF ) image intravenous injection indocyanine green ( ICG ) promise new technique easier intraoperative recognition biliary anatomy . It may help improve outcome laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( Buddingh 2011 , Agarwal 2009 ) . ICG clear quickly exclusively liver intravenous administration . Neither radiological support additional intervention , open biliary tree , require . The NIRF laparoscopy technique use ICG evaluate various animal model ( Figueiredo 2010 , Figueiredo 2011 , Tagaya 2010 , Matsui 2010 ) open , laparoscopic , single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( Tagaya 2010 , Ishazawa 2010 , Ishazawa 2011 Aoki 2010 ) . Promising result present successful intraoperative identification common bile duct cystic duct , compare conventional laparoscopic imaging . Another clinical study show NIRFC technique provide significantly early identification extra-hepatic bile duct CVS dissection phase : 10 minute earlier identification cystic duct common bile duct could obtain ( Schols 2012 ) . Real-time simultaneous image hepatic cystic artery also obtain ( Ashitate 2011 , Mitsuhashi 2008 , Schols 2013 ) . Despite encouraging result ( pre ) clinical feasibility study , wide clinical acceptance routine use ICG fluorescence laparoscopy still lack due absence reliable clinical data . Therefore , multicenter randomize clinical study desirable assess potential add value fluorescence image technique laparoscopic cholecystectomy order perform safe procedure lead reduction vascular bile duct injury . This study compare NIRF assist laparoscopic cholecystectomy conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy . The main objective study evaluate whether early establishment Critical View Safety obtain use NIRF laparoscopy technique laparoscopic cholecystectomy . This shorten operation time , thereby reduce cost procedure . Study design : Multicenter randomize control trial . 308 patient included randomization . All patient ( age &gt; 18 year ) schedule elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy meeting inclusion criterion suitable inclusion . Patients include least 6 hospital The Netherlands : Maastricht University Medical Center+ ; Leiden University Medical Center ; University Medical Center Groningen ; VU University Medical Center , Amphia Hospital ; Catharina Hospital . Treatment subject : All operation perform surgical resident , assist surgeon surgical resident track record least 50 laparoscopic cholecystectomy , perform surgeon surgical resident track record him/herself . In CLC group conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy perform use conventional laparoscopic image system . In NIRF-LC group , use laparoscopic fluorescence image system near-infrared fluorescence cholangiography technique conduct assist laparoscopic cholecystectomy . To obtain fluorescence image biliary tract contrast agent administer . Directly induction anesthesia fluorescent dye , indocyanine green ( ICG ) , administer intraoperative visualization extra-hepatic bile duct NIR fluorescence laparoscope . Since many year ICG approve commercial clinical diagnostic use FDA . Randomization : After inclusion study ( i.e. , write informed consent obtain ) patient randomize NIRF-LC CLC group . Randomization perform centrally . Computerized treatment allocation conduct day surgery . There blind patient surgeons.Stratification factor perform participate center.The experience level surgical team record , stratification take place factor , due large volume patient even distribution skill level randomization arm expect . Experience define perform laparoscopic cholecystectomy first surgeon . Study procedure : The laparoscopic cholecystectomy procedure perform differently usual . Next , radiation involve patient . Neither psychological psychiatric investigation involve . Patients ask undergo additional test surgical procedure , also request fulfill questionnaire . The following procedure conduct study : - Preoperative ( NIRF-LC group ) : Directly induction anesthesia 1ml ( 2,5mg/ml ) indocyanine green administrate via intravenous injection , surgeon surgical trainee ( supervision surgeon anesthesiologist ) . - Intraoperative ( CLC NIRF-LC group ) : Intraoperatively PhD researcher / local researcher ( appoint participate center ) systematically whether localization common bile duct , cystic duct cystic artery identify set time point , conventional camera mode ( CLC group ) fluorescence camera mode ( NIRF-LC group ) . Also establishment CVS register . For agreement identification aforementioned structure attend surgeon consult . A structure score 'identified ' localization confirm great certainty experience surgeon . In case common bile duct explicitly mean surgically expose , contradictory CVS-technique . In accordance regular care , laparoscopic surgical procedure digitally record . - Postoperative qualitative video analysis ( CLC NIRF-LC group ) Performed expert panel 3 surgeon : - Is CVS actually establish ? ( : time CVS establish ? ) - Time identification cystic duct , time identification transition cystic duct gallbladder dissection CVS ; - Time identification cystic artery , time identification transition cystic artery gallbladder dissection CVS ; Postoperative quantitative fluorescence image analysis ( NIRF-LC group ) : For objective assessment degree fluorescence illumination extra-hepatic bile duct artery , OsiriX 5.5.1 Imaging Software use . The fluorescence image analyze determine target-to-background ratio ( TBR ) . TBR define mean fluorescence intensity ( FI ) two point region interest ( ROIs ) target ( i.e . CBD , CD CA ) minus mean fluorescence intensity two background ( BG ) ROIs liver hilum , divide mean fluorescence intensity two background ROIs liver hilum ; formula : TBR = ( FI target - FI BG ) / FI BG . Postoperative registration secondary endpoint ( CLC NIRF-LC group ) . The researcher document follow remain secondary endpoint : Intraoperative bile leakage gallbladder cystic duct ; Bile duct injury ; Postoperative length hospital stay ; Complications due intravenously inject contrast agent ; Conversion open cholecystectomy ; Postoperative complication ( 90 day surgery ) After 90 day patient contact telephone register complication occur routine visit . Cost-effectiveness minimisation procedure calculate , limited per-operative period . The observed reduction time CVS , calculate cost per minute use operate suite , weigh extra cost use equipment fluorescent dye . Postoperative analysis time measurement ( CLC NIRF-LC group ) Regarding primary secondary endpoint , linear regression analysis apply determination possible significant difference time measurement `` first look liver hilum '' `` establishment CVS '' / `` identification transition CD gallbladder '' / `` identification transition CA gallbladder '' ; therewith compare fluorescence laparoscopic image conventional laparoscopic imaging . In case miss value ( occur expert panel analysis , panel concludes actually CVS obtain transition mention structure gallbladder properly identify ) Cox regression analysis use .</detailed_description>
