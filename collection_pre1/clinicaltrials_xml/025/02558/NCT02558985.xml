	<brief_summary>No intervention outside normal course patient care . The investigator collect data specify point throughout cast process . The propose study measure lung compliance cast process spinal manipulation . Research question include : Is quantifiable change lung compliance cast process ? Is individual change lung compliance time compare collection point cast change ? Is change appearance flow-volume loop ? Is decrease oxygen saturation post-induction baseline ? The investigator hypothesize change lung compliance decrease oxygen saturation cast process .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pulmonary Compliance Changes During Manipulation Early Onset Scoliosis Cast Application</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All patient undergo spine manipulation scoliosis cast receive general anesthesia standard anesthetic technique regardless patient include study . The investigator meet patient patient 's parent/guardian prior procedure , traditionally do whether patient participates study , discuss anesthetic plan . As part investigator 's description anesthetic plan , investigator inform patient parent/guardian study include rationale study non-invasive mean obtain data . The data obtain current cast application well subsequent cast application surgery patient return future . A patient 's cast change approximately need per child 's circumstance ; common time period child 's cast may need change include , limited : growth , cast become soil , damage , circumstance study physician feel advisable change cast . The study follow casting procedure complete treatment scoliosis . The standard general anesthesia technique use . Please see Appendix A suggest Anesthesia . There seven data collection point patient 's general anesthetic : 1 . Prior removal old cast , applicable 2 . After removal old cast , applicable 3 . In frame , pre-traction 4 . In frame , traction 5 . Post-body cast application ( prior cast window ; traction ) 6 . Post cast application bed traction ( prior cut window ) 7 . Post-cast window cut ( bed , prior return spontaneous ventilation ) The data collection include follow physiologic parameter : 1 . Non-invasive blood pressure 2 . Heart rate 3 . Oxygen saturation 4 . The amount traction ( pound ) patient place spine manipulation . This measure begin traction , begin cast application , end cast application . 5 . Respiratory measurement Philips Spirometry Module , consist : 1. lung compliance 2. tidal volume 3. peak inspiratory pressure 4. flow volume loop 5. airway resistance Patients also subject chart review . The chart review include previous anesthetic record may provide valuable information concern patient 's baseline lung compliance , tidal volume , peak inspiratory pressure , flow volume loop , airway resistance , amount traction apply scoliosis curve correction . This previous data use compare data collect , cast change . Appendix A : Suggested Anesthesia 1 . Premedication : 0.5mg/kg midazolam PO ( max 15mg ) , PRN 2 . Induction : Mask sevoflurane oxygen 3 . Secure Intravenous Access 4 . Intubation : Propofol 3-4mg/kg IV . Oral endotracheal tube . 5 . Ventilation : Controlled use volume mode 8ml/kg 6 . Maintenance : oxygen , sevoflurane , control ventilation 7 . Emergence : ondansetron 0.15mg/kg IV</detailed_description>
