	<brief_summary>This first-in-human study consist three part . The primary purpose Part I characterize safety tolerability RO6874813 participant locally advance and/or metastatic solid tumor whose disease progress despite standard therapy standard therapy exist . In addition , maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) and/or recommend Phase II dose ( RP2D ) determine . In Part II safety tolerability RO6874813 continue characterize participant locally advance and/or metastatic solid tumor know fibroblast activation protein-alpha positive ( FAP+ ) . In addition , treatment-induced efficacy effect RO6874813 assess functional imaging pair tumor biopsy . The primary purpose Part III demonstrate anti-tumor activity RO6874813 participant recurrent metastatic FAP+ sarcoma .</brief_summary>
