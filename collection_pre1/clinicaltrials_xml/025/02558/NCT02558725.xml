	<brief_summary>Since normal pregnancy associate dilutional anemia , due great increase plasma volume small increase RBC mass , important properly diagnose IDA accord level serum ferritin . Previous study examine optimal iron dose show adjustment iron supplementation accord serum ferritin level early pregnancy could beneficial . Nonetheless , consensus regard appropriate dose iron pregnancy , dose-response curve effect serum ferritin level . In trial investigator seek assess efficacy double daily iron supplement dose pregnant woman IDA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study prospective randomize control trial perform woman 's health center April 2015 . All participant complete blood count perform initial visit clinic first trim pregnancy . IDA define hemoglobin concentration &lt; 10.5 g/dL ferritin level &lt; 15 ng/ml . Inclusion criterion healthy pregnant woman age 18-42 singleton gestation diagnosis IDA 16-19 week . The investigator include woman full access medical computerized file . Exclusion criterion : multiple pregnancy , hyperemesis gravidarum continue past 20 week gestation , Thalassemia , abnormal blood smear , vitamin D deficiency , mal-absorption disorder ( inflammable bowel disease ; Crohn 's , Ulcerative Colitis ) chronic disease associate anemia ( i.e SLE ) . Vitamin B12 blood smear perform time allocation . Additional inclusion criterion apply allocation : deterioration hemoglobin level mandate IV iron administration , 3 capsule miss 2 week check-up , diarrhea last 5 day , vomit last 5 day less 2 hour supplement , administration blood product pregnancy , use multi-vitamin supplement contain iron , hospitalization period great two week time period shorter 15 week allocation delivery . All participant diagnose IDA fulfil inclusion criterion randomize `` Randomizer '' ( http : //www.randomizer.org ) receive either one two capsule aktiferrin F ( contain DL-Serine 129 mg ; Iron ( Ferrous Sulfate ) 34 mg ; Folic Acid 0.5 mg ) Foliferrin ( contain DL-Serine 120 mg ; Iron ( Ferrous Sulfate ) 34 mg ; Folic Acid 0.5 mg ) . No cross-over permit group . Participants instruct take one capsule least 2 hour consumption dairy product two capsule 12 hour apart least 2 hour consumption dairy product . Validation compliance medical regimen perform count empty pill package every two week regular check-ups . All participant monitor weight , BP urine dipstick measurement every 2-3 week 34 week .

Fetal BPP estimate weight perform every 2-3 week 34 week gestation . Fetal monitor perform every two week 34 week gestation . Laboratory follow perform measurement ferritin hemoglobin level fix time interval gestation : 15-20 week , 24 week , 35 week also 6 week post-partum . All lab study perform single central laboratory . The data extract included demographic data ( age , parity , chronic disease , weight BMI allocation weight gain study period ) , obstetrical complication ( GDM , preeclampsia , IUGR , preterm labor , preterm delivery , IUFD blood product transfusion ) non obstetrical complication ( diarrhea , thrombocytopenia , gastroenteritis , appendicitis , hypo/hyperthyroidism , pre-gestational diabetes ) newborn outcome ( birth-weight Apgar score immediate post-partum complication ) .
