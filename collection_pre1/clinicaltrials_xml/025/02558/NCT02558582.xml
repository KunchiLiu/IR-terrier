	<brief_summary>Pulmonary Hypertension ( PH ) serious disease dismal prognosis leave untreated . Advances medical therapy improve survival accord recent registry systematic review , associate high healthcare cost . Earlier study Heidelberg , Germany show good evidence effect exercise training improve exercise performance , quality life pulmonary hemodynamics patient pulmonary hypertension . The main objective present project : 1. investigate quality implementation standardize 3 week in-hospital exercise training program marker outcome disease severity PH-patients Switzerland immediately train 3 12 month . 2. look whether train hyperoxia vs. standard care might effective . This multicentre , randomize parallel-group trial intervention rehabilitation delay one group serve standard care control others . In nested single-centre randomized-controlled trial patent additionally randomize receive either usual rehabilitation ( UR ) rehabilitation standardize supplemental oxygen therapy ( SSOT ) night ergometer training . Patients receive PH specific rehabilitation program 3 week follow instructed home-based training program 12 week . Patients already long-term oxygen therapy ( LTOT ) due daytime hypoxemia additionally randomize receive standardize supplemental oxygen therapy ( SSOT ) train night upon write informed consent .</brief_summary>
