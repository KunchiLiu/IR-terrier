	<detailed_description>Chronic Venous Disease ( CVD ) common problem affect western adult population prevalence &lt; 10 % , among individual young 30 year sex , prevalence 57 % 77 % , men woman age ≥ 70 year respectively , may frequently associate clinical manifestation . The spectrum CVD range varicose vein leg edema , serious dermal clinical manifestation consist hyperpigmentation , eczema , lipodermatosclerosis , venous skin ulceration . To date pathophysiology CVD development enclose several theory role extracellular matrix ( ECM ) component alteration , alteration Matrix Metalloproteinases ( MMPs ) relate molecule , endothelial dysfunction , several genetic factor none could properly explain genesis . A recent study ( Serra R et al ) show high prevalence CVD among patient Breast Cancer ( BC ) respect general population , especially patient positive estrogen receptor ( ER ) expression . The presence ERs investigate wall normal varicose vein Mashiah A. et al , previously , document increased concentration estrogen receptor find varicose vein segment respect healthy control particularly evident female . Endogenous estrogen important regulator vascular homeostasis act mainly via three different ERs express cardiovascular system : ERα , ERβ , G protein-coupled estrogen receptor term GPER . Although ERs also suspect involved underlying etiology , exact molecular mechanism responsible development CVD well relationship wide range clinical manifestation CVD remain elucidated aim study explore expression estrogen receptor vessel wall varicose vein collect patient varicose vein entire clinical spectrum CVD .</detailed_description>
