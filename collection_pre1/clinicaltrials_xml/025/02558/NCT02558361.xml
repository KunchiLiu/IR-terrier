	<detailed_description>Purpose study Apremilast ( Otezla® ) Federal Drug Administration ( FDA ) -approved treatment psoriatic arthritis psoriasis . Although lot data demonstrate apremilast work laboratory , demonstrate work actual target organ , i.e . skin synovial ( joint ) tissue patient psoriasis psoriatic arthritis . Laboratory data demonstrate apremilast decrease inflammatory protein increase anti-inflammatory protein . However , almost data/studies perform blood patient psoriasis psoriatic arthritis , skin synovial ( joint ) tissue . These study perform blood patient condition may , may , reflect true response therapy synovial ( joint ) tissue and/or skin . They also provide data regard timing response target organ . Because limitation exist literature , study assess response apremilast synovial ( joint ) tissue skin need . This small study assess inflammatory response synovial ( joint ) tissue skin sample patient psoriatic arthritis psoriasis . These data important demonstrate effect apremilast target organ tissue ; i.e . synovial ( joint ) tissue skin . We ask take part research study psoriasis psoriatic arthritis . Both condition active appropriate candidate treat apremilast , i.e . treatment would offer enroll study . You also appropriate candidate receive skin synovial ( joint ) tissue biopsy . We want find specific protein skin synovial ( joint ) tissue responsible inflammation associate psoriasis psoriatic arthritis respond treatment apremilast . Study Procedures : What happen study ? This study consist three study visit period three month . If appropriate , start apremilast first study visit . This part standard care . The dose apremilast receive normal FDA-approved dose . You receive placebo ( sugar ) pill . Everyone participate study treat apremilast . The study procedure take place three visit list : Baseline Visit : Review inclusion/exclusion criterion Medical history obtain study nurse A physical examination study doctor Obtain blood urine sample psoriatic arthritis psoriasis . These data important demonstrate effect apremilast target organ tissue ; i.e . synovial ( joint ) tissue skin .</detailed_description>
