	<brief_title>Optimal Head Neck Position During Videolaryngoscopy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The optimum patient head neck position direct laryngoscopy ( anaesthetist view larynx curve metallic blade pass tube ventilation lung ) traditionally consider `` sniff morning air '' ( neck flexion head extension ) position . This question previously randomize control study date explore statement . The patient optimally position prior induction anaesthesia , especially event unexpected difficult intubation , Difficult Airway Society guideline suggest use alternative laryngoscope . In current clinical practice videolaryngoscope ( curve blade camera attach allows anaesthetist see around corner ) use alternative laryngoscope . To best knowledge , ideal patient position videolaryngoscopy yet describe . The intubation time rate success intubation use C-Mac D-Blade videolaryngoscope previously assess Serocki et al , sniff position . It possible adopt different position use C-Mac D- Blade might result superior view larynx . Furthermore , optimal patient position yet assess intubation King Vision videolaryngoscope . This key information could gain precious second difficult airway scenario ( secure airway tube ventilation prove difficult ) obvious implication patient management . The answer question could also help anaesthetist take inform decision use videolaryngoscopy intubate trachea elective setting . The investigator aim assess effect two different position laryngeal view obtain videolaryngoscopy two commercially available well establish videolaryngoscopes try answer question .</detailed_description>
