	<brief_summary>This Study evaluate utility prospective HLA-B*1301 screening incidence dapsone hypersensitivity syndrome ( DHS ) 3130 previously Dapsone ( DDS ) -naive patient . Those patient include allergic cutaneous vasculitis , urticaria , psoriasis , acne , bullous skin disease , sterile pustulosis , leprosy , pneumocystis pneumonia patient need dapsone administration . The study two ( co-primary ) objective : ) determine screen HLA-B*1301 prior DDS-containing treatment result low incidence clinically-suspected DHS versus current standard care ( genetic screening ) ii ) determine screen HLA-B*1301 prior DDS-containing treatment result significantly low incidence immunologically-confirmed DHS versus current standard care ( genetic screening patch test ) . The study consist 5-day screening period , randomised observation period ( Day 1 Week 6 ) , subject experience suspect DHS subset DDS-tolerant subject , epicutaneous patch test ( EPT ) assessment period . Eligible subject randomise one two study arm : Current Standard Care Arm ( prospective genetic screening : Control ) Genetic Screening Arm ( prospective genetic screening : Case ) . Subjects identify HLA-B*1301 positive prospective Genetic Screening Arm receive dapsone exclude study . Subjects experience suspect DHS 6-week observation would withdraw dapsone undergo EPT patch test 6 week later .</brief_summary>
