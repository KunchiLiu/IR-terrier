	<brief_summary>The BCI project fall within broad field brain machine interface . Its multiple application include compensation motor deficit . The subject present protocol first test system man compensation motor deficit epidural brain implant enable electrocorticogram ( EcoG ) record .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brain Computer Interface : Neuroprosthetic Control Motorized Exoskeleton</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Injuries cervical spine content , spinal cord , cause serious neurological deficit , loss motor function sensitivity four limb , result quadriplegia . The level lesion separate area without deficit , lesion , sub-lesional area depend extent spine injury ( dislocation , fracture trauma without final displacement ) , may cause spinal cord injury vary severity , range benign complete section result complete irreversible sensorimotor deficit . Lesions C1 C4 often immediately fatal cause diaphragmatic paralysis ( innervated phrenic nerve whose root originate C4 ) . C4-C5 paraplegia therefore compatible life spare respiratory autonomy , although lead severe permanent disability , create state severe dependence subject often young . The problem create patient extremely heavy individual , family , societal burden addition individual drama . While paraplegic , maintain motor skill sensitivity upper limb back muscle often reintegrate find remarkable mobility wheelchair , case quadriplegic must provide substitute order achieve acceptable quality life . This project offer highly innovative approach mean motorize exoskeleton enable stand , walk use upper extremity . The validation first step concept pave way develop increasingly sophisticated exoskeletal neuroprostheses , aim give patient compatible ever great autonomy .</detailed_description>
