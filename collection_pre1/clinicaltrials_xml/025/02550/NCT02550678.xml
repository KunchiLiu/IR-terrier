	<detailed_description>The primary purpose study determine whether ASN-002 alone combination 5-FU safe effective treatment nodular basal cell carcinoma ( nBCC ) . Patients age 18 , diagnose nodular Basal Cell Carcinoma ( nBCC ) , may eligible join study . Study detail : ASN-002 immunotherapeutic product inject BCC spot treat . It make modify adenovirus serotype 5 ( also call Ad5 ) . Adenoviruses common nature worldwide cause mild cold respiratory infection people usually recover without treatment . The Ad5 use study modify grow body cause infection . The modified Ad5 study deliver artificially make genetic material cancerous surround cell . This genetic material produce human interferon normally produce body stimulate immune system . It hop injected ASN-002 cause body 's cell produce interferon stimulate immune system attack cancerous cell reduce size eliminate nBCC . Participants attend study centre weekly injection ASN-002 alone combination 5-FU nBCC . The participant recruit 3 injection 3 week , undergo surgical excision tumor . Patient outcome assess use tumour sample collect surgery incidence adverse event occur throughout study . It hop finding trial provide information safety efficacy use ASN-002 alone combination 5-FU nBCC , particularly patient standard treatment surgery possible recommend .</detailed_description>
