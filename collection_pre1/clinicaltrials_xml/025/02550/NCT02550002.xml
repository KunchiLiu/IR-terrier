	<detailed_description>Age-related macular degeneration ( AMD ) lead cause blindness elderly population develop country . Severe visual loss AMD usually occur patient neovascular AMD ( nAMD ) , cause vascular endothelial growth factor A ( VEGF-A ) drive choroidal neovascularization ( CNV ) . Intravitreal therapy VEGF-A inhibitor current standard treatment nAMD . Optimization current VEGF-A therapy include find dose regimen maximize visual acuity ( VA ) minimize frequency intravitreal injection associate risk treatment . The `` treat extend '' protocol OCT guide primary aim complete resolution retinal fluid , i.e . intraretinal fluid ( IRF ) subretinal fluid ( SRF ) , consider sign disease activity . Once fluid resolve , extension treatment interval 2 week mandate . If return either SRF IRF , interval shorten one week . Currently , relevance IRF SRF relation best-corrected visual acuity ( BCVA ) outcomes still dispute . From CATT VIEW study reason suspect SRF may allow remain extend treatment interval without affect BCVA . In contrast IRF clearly show correlate poorer VA consider sign active disease , SRF may sign impaired pump function RPE , similar see central serous chorioretinopathy may consider indication ongoing disease activity . The consequence insist upon complete lack SRF ( strict approach ) injection therefore increase exposure retina anti-VEGF agent . And recent report frequent intravitreal injection may lead change retinal nerve fiber layer increase risk geographic atrophy development . As consequence , limit number injection would desirable VA result could achieve . From pivotal anti-VEGF study become apparent patient show individualised response therapy . As optimization individualize treatment need explore understood . This study aim explore `` treat extend '' approach evaluate compare two individualized aflibercept treatment regimen , differentiate definition disease activity determine treatment interval next injection . The aim determine whether small amount SRF may tolerate use `` treat extend '' regimen treatment nAMD whether presence extent intra-retinal fluid and/or sub-retinal fluid ( SRF ) help decide extension reduction treatment interval `` treat extend '' regimen . The result use generate recommendation strict versus relaxed treatment approach utilise within clinically practical `` treat extend '' approach maximize patient outcome , reduce need potentially unnecessary intravitreal injection . Taking together , study aim optimization flexible patient treatment .</detailed_description>
