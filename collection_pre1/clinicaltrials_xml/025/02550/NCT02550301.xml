	<brief_summary>Platelets play major role thrombus formation platelet size , measure Mean Platelet Volume ( MPV ) correlate platelet activity . MPV increase patient Myocardial Infarction ( MI ) independent predictor adverse event patient ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction ( STEMI ) . Data MPV patient stable angina limited . Aspirin clopidogrel antiplatelet agent administer routinely patient undergo PCI require stent patency . MPV know affect low dose Aspirin . Treatment clopidogrel think reduce MPV in-vitro magnitude reduction MPV unclear , especially patient stable angina undergoing PCI . An inverse correlation also exist MPV platelet count . The investigator aim assess change occur MPV ( ∆ MPV ) routine clopidogrel administration patient stable angina undergoing PCI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Does Mean Platelet Volume Change With Clopidogrel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This prospective , observational study . The investigator aim conduct pilot study assess change MPV ( ∆ MPV ) routine clopidogrel patient stable angina undergoing PCI . Reduced responsiveness clopidogrel ( otherwise know clopidogrel resistance ) well document . Clopidogrel resistance result adverse long term effect include stent thrombosis mortality . Diagnosis clopidogrel resistance require special analyzer reagent . There potential cost factor involve analyzer reagent use test resistance . There known clinical biochemical marker clopidogrel resistance . If pilot study result demonstrate MPV change ( ∆MPV ) clopidogrel , prospective trial conduct future correlate ∆MPV clopidogrel resistance measure analyzer test . This could establish ∆MPV potential cheap , effective biochemical marker clopidogrel resistance . If investigator successful demonstrate change MPV clopidogrel , pilot study facilitate conduct future large study demonstrate correlation ∆MPV clopidogrel resistance . This could establish ∆MPV potential cheap , effective biochemical marker clopidogrel resistance resultant benefit subject institution . All clopidogrel naive patient stable angina symptom electively list coronary angiography PCI Peter Munk Cardiac Centre ( PMCC ) , Toronto General Hospital ( TGH ) , include pilot study . This pilot study conduct compliance protocol , Good Clinical Practice ( GCP ) University Health Network ( UHN ) policy Study hypothesis . The investigator hypothesize MPV value remain clopidogrel patient stable angina undergoing PCI aim disprove hypothesis Study Design This prospective pilot study include consecutive clopidogrel naïve patient stable angina symptom , electively list coronary angiography PCI Peter Munk Cardiac Centre ( PMCC ) , Toronto General Hospital ( TGH ) , prospectively include pilot study . These patient give routine load dose clopidogrel 600milligrams ( mg ) follow daily dose clopidogrel 75mg daily undergo PCI ( per protocol patient undergo PCI ) . Complete Blood Count ( CBC ) perform routinely patient prior load dose clopidogrel ( day 0 ) one occasion post PCI per UHN standard care . MPV platelet count automatically generate analysis CBC . Ten milliliter ( ml ) blood drawn eligible , consented patient time admission , collect ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid ( EDTA ) tube , test CBC . Platelets average life span vary 8-10 day 10-36 days12 . To minimize bias , three additional MPV sample collect day 1 , day 7 day 30 post PCI . The sample analyze within 2 hour venipuncture minimize artefactual increase MPV prolong exposure EDTA collection tube . Change MPV ( ∆MPV ) change platelet count ( ∆Platelet count ) calculate follow : - MPV = MPV admission - Mean MPV clopidogrel - Platelet count = Platelet count admission - Mean Platelet count clopidogrel These result correlate adverse event ( readmission MI ) 30 day collect data regard readmission cardiac blood test ( MI ) electronic patient record ( EPR ) system online . The universal definition MI adhere . Platelet inhibition occur within 2 hour load dose reach steady state 3 7 day . Repeated sample ensure effect steady level clopidogrel MPV reduce bias.No change intervention medication occur-all patient receive treatment accord UHN standard care . No randomization blind involve pilot study . The expected duration participation 1 month index procedure repeat blood test require day 7 day 30 procedure adverse event assess day 30 . Patients discharge day procedure need return blood test follow day , day 7 day 30 PCI ( 3 visit ) . Patients discharge day procedure need return blood test day 7 day 30 PCI ( 2 visit ) . This involve travel time ( approximately 1 hour way ) time give blood sample ( 30 minute inclusive wait time ) equal total 2.5 hour visit . Patients overall time commitment 7.5 hour 3 visit 5 hour 2 visit . Statistics MPV automatically analyze ( CBC sample ) Abbott CELL-DYN Sapphire @ analyzer TGH laboratory . The sample size estimate use formula : Z = 1.96 95 % Confidence Interval ( CI ) σ = standard deviation ( SD ) outcome variable = 0.219 fl MPV ( Hematology Laboratory Quality Control ( QC ) MPV analyze Abbott CELL-DYN Sapphire @ ( 8.46 fl ) . E ( 5 % ) = desire margin error In order ensure 95 % confidence interval estimate MPV adult stable angina undergoing PCI within 0.219 femtolitre ( fl ) true mean MPV , sample size 74 patient require pilot project . Assuming attrition rate 30 % , sample size 100 patient would require . The formula take account QC mean obtain Abbott CELL-DYN Sapphire @ . An attrition rate 30 % take account patient may able return repeat blood test . In addition determine MPV change clopidogrel , ∆MPV correlate presence clopidogrel use Receiver Operating Curves ( ROC ) ∆Platelet count . The study terminate completion collection 4 blood sample pre-specified time point 74 patient ( actual calculate sample size ) stable angina undergo angiography PCI . All eligible patient ( per inclusion criterion ) include trial . Only person involve pilot study ( i.e . PI , Co-PI , research fellow research nurse ) access source data document maintain secure location PMCC site . Any electronic data specific UHN designate on-site computer , password protect accessible designate research team . Review Assessment adverse event Adverse effect expect time blood collection . A designated contact telephone number research nurse make available participate patient event rare adverse effect fainting time blood collection , bruise infection access site . Consent process Patients consent prior procedure - background propose study relative benefit risk study clearly explain patient prior procedure day . If patient 's native language English patient speak/understand English , UHN designate native language translator involve purpose consent . Patients must sign consent form prior enrollment . A UHN prototype consent form prototype use purpose .
