	<criteria>Patients must histologically prove adenocarcinoma rectum evidence distant metastasis . The tumor must clinically Stage II ( T34 N0 ) stage III ( N+ ) . Stage tumor may determine CT scan , endorectal ultrasound MRI . ( For patient receive chemotherapy prior protocol chemoradiation , initial clinical stage applies . CT/MRI/PET perform within 2 month study entry exclude disease progression . ) Measurable disease require baseline . Patient 's without measurable disease may enrol long clinically meet stage II III criterion . Patients must receive pelvic radiation rectal cancer , prior pelvic radiation malignancy would prevent patient receiving require radiation treatment study . ( Patients may receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior study chemoradiation ) Patients must active concurrent invasive malignancy . Patients prior malignancy , include invasive colon cancer , eligible deem physician low risk recurrence . For example , patient squamous basal cell carcinoma skin , melanoma situ , carcinoma cervix , carcinoma situ colon rectum effectively treat eligible , even condition diagnose within 3 year prior registration . Patients must &gt; 18 year age , ECOG performance status 01 Neutrophil Count &gt; 1,000/µl , platelet &gt; 100,000/µl , total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x &lt; ULN ULN ( except patient Gilbert 's syndrome may include total bilirubin &lt; 3xULN direct bilirubin within normal range ) , ALT &lt; 2.5xULN , AST &lt; 2.5xULN , creatinine &lt; 1.5xULN , fast plasma glucose &lt; 140 mg/dL HbA1c &lt; 6.4 % ( criteria met ) , anemia &gt; 9.0g/dL.Potassium , Calcium Magnesium ( correct albumin ) within normal range &lt; grade 1 determine clinically significant treat investigator . INR &lt; 1.5 Patient able swallow retain oral medication . Left ventricular ejection fraction within normal &gt; 50 % Signed informed consent able comply study and/or follow procedure . QTcF &lt; 480 msec Patients history diarrhea review patient inform potential study drug induce diarrhea management . This must document treat MD . See section 5 baseline assessment patient history diarrhea . Patient known hypersensitivity excipients BYL719 ( alpelisib ) Suspected confirm metastatic disease include CNS involvement Patient clinically manifest diabetes mellitus , document steroid induce diabetes mellitus Patient impair gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption oral BYL719 ( e.g . ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , small bowel resection ) . Patients colostomy allow unless colostomy one preclude reason . Patient recover grade 1 better ( except alopecia ) relate side effect prior antineoplastic therapy Patient systemic therapy within 4 week start study treatment ( 6 week nitrosoureas mitomycin C ) Patient undergone major surgery ≤ 4 week prior start study treatment investigator opinion recover side effect procedure Patient follow cardiac abnormality : A. symptomatic Congestive heart failure i. history document congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association functional classification IIIIV ) , document cardiomyopathy ii . Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 50 % determined Multiple Gated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan echocardiogram ( ECHO ) B. myocardial infarction &lt; 6 month prior enrollment C. unstable angina pectoris D. serious uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia E. symptomatic pericarditis F. QTcF &gt; 480 msec screen ECG ( use QTcF formula ) Patient currently receive medication know risk prolong QT interval induce Torsades de Pointes ( TdP ) treatment either discontinue switched different medication prior start study drug treatment . To document submit BrUOG registration . Please refer appendix F G. Patient participate prior investigational cancer treatment study within 30 day prior enrollment . This refer treatment followup . Patient currently receive warfarin coumarin derive anticoagulant , treatment , prophylaxis otherwise . Therapy heparin , low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) , fondaparinux allow . To document submit BrUOG registration . Eliquis allow . Patient currently receive treatment drug know strong inhibitor inducer isoenzyme CYP3A . The patient must discontinue strong inducer least one week must discontinue strong inhibitor start treatment . Switching different medication prior registration allow ; ( Refer Section Concomitant Medication , Appendix F G ) . Patient known positive serology human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) Patient condition would , Investigator 's judgment , preclude patient 's participation clinical study due safety concern compliance clinical study procedure , e.g . infection/inflammation , intestinal obstruction , unable swallow oral medication , social/psychological complication , chronic active hepatitis , severe hepatic impairment etc Patients concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition would , Treating Physician 's judgment , contraindicate patient participation individual patient program ( eg . active uncontrolled severe infection , chronic active hepatitis , immunocompromised , acute chronic pancreatitis , uncontrolled high blood pressure , interstitial lung disease , etc . ) Patient history noncompliance medical regimen inability grant consent Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman , pregnancy define state female conception termination gestation , confirm positive hCG laboratory test ( &gt; 5 mIU/mL ) . Pregnancy test require patient consider postmenopausal childbearing potential define . Women consider postmenopausal childbearing potential 12 month natural ( spontaneous ) amenorrhea appropriate clinical profile ( e.g . age appropriate , history vasomotor symptom ) surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) least six week ago . For woman therapyinduced amenorrhea , oophorectomy serial measurement FSH and/or estradiol need ensure postmenopausal status . Patient apply highly effective contraception study duration define final dose study treatment : 1 . Sexually active male ( unless surgically sterilize least 6 month prior screen ) use condom intercourse take drug 6 month final dose study treatment father child period , may recommend seek advice conservation sperm . The use spermicidal foam also highly suggest use condom another form protection . A condom require use also vasectomize men order prevent delivery drug via seminal fluid . Males caution donate sperm actively receive treatment study . 2 . Women childbearing potential , defined woman physiologically capable become pregnant , must use highly effective contraception study 6 month final dose study treatment . Herbal preparations/medications allow throughout study . These herbal medication include , limited : St. John 's wort , Kava , ephedra ( huang ) , gingko biloba , dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA ) , yohimbe , saw palmetto , Medical Marijuana ginseng . Patients need stop use herbal medication 7 day prior first dose study drug . Patient must eat drink Seville orange ( juice ) , grapefruit grapefruit juice , grapefruit hybrid , pummelo , starfruits cranberry juice 7 day prior first dose study drug entire study treatment Patient currently receive receive systemic corticosteroid &lt; 2 week prior day 1 study drug , fully recover side effect treatment . The following us corticosteroid permit : single dos , topical application ( e.g. , rash ) , inhale spray ( e.g. , obstructive airway disease ) , eye drop local injection ( e.g. , intraarticular ) . Patient concurrently use anticancer therapy</criteria>
