	<brief_summary>While hypothesised individual experience social anxiety likely misread facial emotion threaten disapproving , researcher propose difficulty may lie decode ambiguous facial expression rather identify emotion express great intensity . Emotion recognition ( ER ) train provide promise new avenue research may beneficial alter emotion processing bias maintain increase symptom mental health disorder . This study examine effectiveness ER train community-based sample young people ( 15-18 year ) report high level social anxiety . The intervention aim alter emotion processing bias train procedure design promote perception happiness disgust ambiguous facial expression hypothesise subsequently reduce symptom social anxiety . The study design consist two phase . During Phase 1 participant complete screen questionnaire . This questionnaire include measure affective , cognitive , behavioural component social anxiety adolescence . Depending suitability ( i.e . score cut-off standardised measure social anxiety Phase 1 study ) , participant may invite take part 4-day computer-based emotion recognition training programme ( Phase 2 ) . The purpose phase see ER train help young people feel less worried nervous social situation train interpret ambiguous facial expression express positive emotion ( happy rather disgust ) . Participants randomly assign either intervention placebo ( inactive ) group . Both group ask complete 4-day programme involve one computer training session per day ( session take approximately 20 minute ) . Questionnaires also give participant complete intervention , along 2-week follow-up assessment . These include questionnaire measure social anxiety , depressive symptom , fear negative evaluation . Each questionnaire take approximately 15 minute complete . Participants know whether receive intervention placebo train intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Social anxiety disorder ( SAD ) among prevalent mental disorder adolescence , 10 % female 5 % male diagnose SAD adolescence . SAD characterise mark fear anxiety social situation individual expose possible scrutiny others . SAD associate social isolation , poor social skill , low self-esteem , future comorbid mental disorder . Social anxiety typically develop adolescence , thus need detect treat early prior development clinically-diagnosed SAD . Most early intervention social anxiety use Cognitive Behavioural Therapy ( CBT ) , focus modify explicit verbal cognition . However , many adolescent access CBT many find demand . Research suggest individual high level social anxiety likely misread facial emotion threaten disapproving , researcher propose difficulty may lie decode low intensity facial expression rather identify facial emotion express great intensity . In social anxiety , bias towards perceive ambiguous facial expression negative may give rise avoidant behaviour maintain increase symptom ; therefore , emotion processing bias may powerful bias researcher target aim develop intervention reduce symptom . ER train provide promise new line research may beneficial alter emotion processing bias maintain increase symptom mental health disorder . Research show ER training may effective reduce depressive symptom analogue population high level depression anger aggressive behaviour healthy adult adolescent youth high risk criminal offending delinquency . Present Study : This research test effectiveness ER training reduce social anxiety adolescent . Given age onset social anxiety adolescence , peak late teen , research focus 15-18 year old . Aims &amp; Objectives : To test effectiveness ER training reduce social anxiety adolescent . The intervention aim alter emotion processing bias train procedure design promote perception happiness disgust ambiguous facial expression hypothesise subsequently reduce symptom social anxiety . Central Research Questions : Is ER train associate : I . An increase perception positive ( happy ) negative ( disgust ) emotion face display ambiguous emotional expression ? II . A decrease negative evaluation ? III . A decrease social anxiety ? IV . A decrease form anxiety and/or symptom depression ? PHASE 1 : SCREENING FOR SOCIAL ANXIETY IN ADOLESCENTS Objective : To screen sub-clinical level social anxiety adolescent . School Sampling : Approximately 8 large second-level school Dublin randomly select Department Education Skills 2012 publish list school . Power Analysis : Using G*Power 3.1 , sample size determine 111 base follow parameter : medium effect size 0.3 , alpha 0.05 , power 0.8 , repeat measure within-between interaction : 2 ( Randomization ) X 3 ( Pre , Post , Follow-up ) . Participants : Adolescents age 15-18 year second-level school invite initial screening . Procedure : Adolescents must return parental informed consent form . Participants screen use Social Phobia Anxiety Inventory Children ( SPAI-C ) . Participants score cut-off ≥18 invite participate intervention ( Phase 2 ) . Approximately 440 second-level student across 8 school invite complete screening . With approximate response rate 50 % ( N=220 ) , use cut-off ≥18 120 identify ( 60 per condition ) . PHASE 2 : RANDOMIZED CONTROL TRIAL Objective : To compare effectiveness ER placebo train reduce social anxiety . Participants : Adolescents Phase 1 screen cut-off ≥18 invite participate intervention randomly assign ER/placebo training . On basis screening , PI ensure group equivalence across ER versus placebo group key variable ( e.g. , age , gender , social anxiety ) advance randomization . Post randomization , independent variable check ensure balance across group contaminate outcome study . Procedure : Participants ER placebo train group receive 4 training session 4 consecutive day . The intervention perform laptop school deliver quiet room researcher present . Pre-intervention data collect day 1 prior training , post-intervention data collect day 4 follow training , follow-up assessment 2-weeks post-intervention . Training Task : Participants complete train 4 consecutive day school . Each session include computerised training programme comprise three phase , baseline , training , test , take approximately 15 minute complete . A follow-up assessment complete two week post-intervention . During 2-week follow-up assessment participant complete final assessment emotion sensitivity use test phase emotion recognition task . - Prototypical 'happy ' 'disgust ' composite image generate 40 individual face ( 20 x male , 20 x female ) show disgust facial expression , 40 individual show happy expression . - Prototypical image use endpoint generate linear morph sequence consist image change incrementally unambiguously 'happy ' unambiguous 'disgust ' , emotionally ambiguous image middle . The propose research include sequence 15 equally spaced image gender ( male female ) use experimental stimulus . - Previous research University Bristol use stimulus portray male face . The task stimuli current research match participant 's gender , i.e . female participant complete task include female face stimulus male participant complete task include male face stimulus . - Baseline test phase consist 45 trial , stimulus morph sequence present participant three time . The task require participant make force choice judgement whether face display happy disgust expression . Images present one time , random order , 150 millisecond . Stimuli precede fixation cross , presented random period range 1500 2500 millisecond . Subsequent presentation , prevent processing image , backward mask noise present 250 millisecond , follow prompt ask participant respond . This remain screen participant make response ( i.e. , judgement 'happy ' 'disgust ' ) . - Trials train phase similar trial baseline test phase respect inter-trial interval stimulus presentation , addition feedback subsequent participant 's response . In placebo condition , feedback base participant 's baseline balance point . That , response classify 'correct ' participant identify image original balance point image 'disgust ' 'happy ' , otherwise classified 'incorrect ' . Feedback message say 'Correct / Incorrect ! That face disgust/happy ' . In train condition , feedback base participant 's baseline balance point , 'correct ' classification shift two morph step towards 'disgust ' end continuum , two image nearest balance point participant would previously classify 'disgust ' baseline consider 'happy ' provide feedback . In train block , face 15 face continuum present twice . The order presentation randomize within block . Three train block give participant , result 90 training trial per session total 360 training trial total . Outcome Measures : Outcome measure administer participant RCT pre-intervention ( baseline day 1 ) , post-intervention ( day 4 ) , 2-week follow-up , include : Emotion Sensitivity Measurement Accuracy assess use baseline test measurement ER/placebo training session . Social Phobia Anxiety Inventory Children ( SPAI-C ) The SPAI-C 26-item self-report instrument good psychometric property adolescent sample . The SPAI-C measure somatic , cognitive , behavioural aspect social phobia child adolescent . Questions relate nervous respondent feel carry certain task response rat 3-point scale never , hardly ever time , always high score indicate great level social anxiety . Brief Fear Negative Evaluations Scale - Revised ( BFNE-R ) Negative evaluation important aspect social anxiety . The BFNE-R 12-item measure assess fear negative evaluation . Items respond 5-point Likert scale 0 4 . The BFNE-R show high internal consistency correlate well original BFNE . Screen Child Anxiety Related Disorders ( SCARED ) Child Version The SCARED use screen sign anxiety disorder . The 41-item measure use measure anxiety , include panic , separation anxiety , generalise anxiety , social avoidance , school phobia . It show high reliability adolescent . Items rat 3-point Likert scale . Internal consistency show high adolescent sample . Depression Subscale Revised Child Anxiety Depression Scale ( RCADS ) The RCADS 47-item self-report measure good psychometric property adolescent sample . The Depression Subscale contain 10 item . Items relate frequency depressive symptom experience rat 4-point Likert scale . Research Design : A mixed model 2 ( Randomization ) x 3 ( Time ) complex design combine subject within subject condition employ . Each participant test pre-intervention , post-intervention , 2-week follow-up . Independent Variables : Randomization ( K=2 ; ER training/ Placebo ) Time ( K=3 ; Pre-intervention [ day 1 ] , Post-intervention [ day 4 ] , Follow-up ) Analyses : All analysis change social anxiety , anxiety , depression , fear negative evaluation conduct intention-to-treat analysis . Descriptive statistic Chi-square analysis ANOVAs Primary analysis consist two-way repeat ANOVAs 2 ( Randomization ) x 3 ( Time ) test variable study .</detailed_description>
