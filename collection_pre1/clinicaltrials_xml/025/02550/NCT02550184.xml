	<detailed_description>Protocol RCT 1.4 Ultrasonography Emergency Department A Randomised Controlled Multicenter Study RCT 1.4.1 Background Patients arrive Emergency Department acute symptom respiratory problem diagnostic challenge . Their symptom similar time life threaten require different specific treatment . The assessment fast correct diagnosis therefore high importance patient correct instant treatment lifesaving . In 2014 Lancet Respiratory Medicine publish article write Laursen et al . They present Danish study show use focused ultrasonographic examination complementary tool regular diagnostic assessment patient respiratory symptom increase percentage patient receive correct diagnosis also percentage patient receive correct treatment within 4 hour admittance Emergency Department . The study criticize perform single physician , experience ultrasonographer single center therefore transferrable Danish Emergency Departments physicians general . Consequently study expansion study Laursen et al . accommodate point criticism . It execute multicenter study several Danish Emergency Departments . The ultrasonographic examination perform interpreted medical physician already work emergency department . Purpose To investigate percentage correctly diagnose patient 4 hour admittance Emergency Department ( ED ) increase patient examine diagnose use standard diagnostics focus ultrasonography lung heart , compare use X-ray alone multicenter study . Patients include Patients arrive internal medicine ED difficulty respiration screen participation . Hypothesis That difference diagnostic accuracy 4 hour admittance ED compare usual diagnostic assessment usual diagnostic assessment + ultrasonographic examination ( US ) lungs heart . Trial design A prospective randomise control clinical multicenter study parallel group design . Allocation ratio 1:1 . A superiority study . Gold standard primary endpoint The gold standard correct diagnosis 4 hour patient arrival define final diagnosis achieve medical journal audit make patient discharged hospital . This do two auditor . In case disagreement third auditor repeat medical journal audit . Methods Participating center EDs follow hospital participate : OUH , OUH-Svendborg , , Esbjerg , Åbenrå , Viborg , Ålborg , Køge , Holbæk , Hvidovre . The project approve Ethical Committee Region Southern Denmark head EDs participate hospital . Investigators The investigator medical physician either specialist physician specialist train regularly attend patient ED familiar US supplemental tool assessment medical diagnosis . The project manager responsible educate investigator project US Protocol well supervision take place necessary . Project Ultrasound protocol This protocol consist US lung heart : The USexamination perform follow : The anterior lateral part thorax divide superior inferior quadrant . Each quadrant represent zone probe shall place centrally create transverse picture costa pleura . A sequence minimum 6 second include least one inspiration one expiration shall record every zone . The US examination heart inspire FATE protocol use 4-chamber picture heart achieve either subxiphoid apical window . A sequence minimum 6 second heart shall record . All recording US save raw data later evaluation specialist US , blind respect investigator evaluation US well presumptive final diagnosis patient . Randomization Conducted block randomization use random-number generator . The investigator external access database , continuously assign randomization number . Blinding The physician blind randomization result primary tentative diagnosis register . The result US unblinded treat physician intervention group . Unblinded US result register investigator registration chart archive ED label patient ID-number . In electronic patient journal system register randomization number US result . Details register electronic patient journal system name registration number project , acceptance patient , name local investigator perform US , localization registration chart ED contain result US . We hereby create possibility blind audit use electronic patient journal make possible obtain result US case result need later diagnostic process investigator present . Data collection inclusion patient The investigator screen patient admit ED accord inclusion exclusion criterion . He obtain informed consent verbal write habile patient meet inclusion criterion . The investigator fill registration chart assign database . The attend physician performs primary medical assessment patient fill registration chart Presumptive diagnosis primary assessment . The investigator unblinds randomisation number performs US examination accord project US protocol . The investigator inform physician charge primary medical assessment ultrasound finding patient intervention group . He fill registration chart Ultrasound finding . The investigator fill registration chart Ultrasound find patient intervention group archive map locate ED . The patient continue treatment investigation accord department guideline . Once patient discharge hospital follow take place : 1 . Blinded review US . 2 . Registration correct diagnosis blind audit electronic medical journal . 3 . Registration basic characteristic data secondary endpoint . Risks , side effect , disadvantage There risk radiation know side effect relation US .

Sample-size Is base upon estimate percentage patient expect receive correct tentative diagnosis within 4 hour arrival ED . This estimate set 65 % base data Laursen et al . A clinically relevant enhancement tentative diagnosis use US set minimum 15 % . To detect 15 % increase number correct tentative diagnosis , 65 % control group 80 % intervention group , 80 % chance detection level significance 5 % 272 include patient need . The estimate drop 6 % increase number inclusion 288 patient . Data analysis The gold standard diagnostic accuracy constitute medical journal audit include result US chest X-ray examination group patient . DATA ANALYSIS Descriptive data Descriptive statistic group give ; health characteristic ; patient symptom ; measure variable upon arrival ED well answer primary secondary endpoint . Categorical data summarize use number proportion patient , continuous data present use number patient ( n ) , mean , SD , median , minimum maximum . Primary end point The c2 test , alternatively Fischer exact test use establish difference distribution total number patient correct/incorrect ' 4 h ' presumptive diagnosis control group intervention group . Secondary end point To compare intervention group control group use follow test : comparison mean : Student test ; comparison median ; ManneWhitney test comparison proportion ; c2 Fisher exact test . All test perform two-sided significance level 5 % . The gold standard include UL examination evaluate specialist group . Using audit diagnosis gold standard , group , assess diagnostic performance primary evaluation , ' 4-h ' presumptive diagnosis UL examination calculate sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value diagnostic accuracy 95 % CI . We analyze data use intention-to-treat principle . Data analysis conduct use STATA ( StataCorp ) . Data entry security Measured data enter database make project RedCap OPEN . All data store manage accord law regulation state Danish Data Protection Agency . Time frame Based pilot study estimate period inclusion 1- 5 week base upon duty frequency vary 1 5 8 hour shifts week estimate inclusion rate 20 patient per investigator . The period inclusion set 16 week . Ethics The study conduct accordance Helsinki II Declaration approve Regional Ethics Committee Data Inspectorate . In case UL finding compatible acute life-threatening condition attend physician inform UL finding unblended . This registered database . Procedure collect informed consent The project comply guideline issue The National Ethical Scientific Committee , law nr . 593 14th June 2011 concern process ethical research research project field health science . The investigation diagnostic feature UL examination primary care demand short time delivery write verbal information collection inform consent examination .
