	<brief_title>High Intensity Interval Training After Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke lead cause adult disability . Well designed study show majority stroke population low aerobic capacity many inactive . This negative health well-being . Physical inactivity may increase risk recurrent stroke . The optimal training mode intensity improve aerobic capacity stroke clear . High intensity interval training ( ie . 90-95 % peak heart rate ) proven beneficial moderate low intensity exercise order improve maximal oxygen uptake patient cardiac disease . The response training aerobic capacity physical function stroke population know .</detailed_description>
