	<brief_summary>In 2014 , American Urological Association update management algorithm Interstitial Cystitis/Painful Bladder Syndrome ( IC/PBS ) . As algorithm progress , intervention become increasingly invasive morbid . 4th line treatment sacral neuromodulation ( SNM ) , involve two stage surgical procedure permanent device implantation . While mechanism decrease IC/PBS symptom unknown , SNM think act central peripheral mechanism relate afferent signaling , cause modification pain low urinary tract sensation.ยน Percutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation ( PTNS ) method peripheral neuromodulation target nerve root SNM , significantly few risk . The purpose research determine PTNS effective treatment IC/PBS . The result study suggest future direction provide critical information design study determine extent situation PTNS may effective . The investigator enroll subject IC/PBS urinary frequency/urgency treatment 12 weekly treatment PTNS . The investigator assess symptom low urinary tract function , treatment . At completion treatment , subject ask enroll post-study follow monitoring understand duration symptom effect .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Percutaneous Posterior Tibial Nerve Stimulation Treatment IC/PBS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The overall objective prospective , pilot study determine percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation ( PTNS ) effective treatment interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome ( IC/PBS ) . Our specific aim evaluate PTNS perform regard reduction symptom subject disorder . The primary outcome variable percentage subject report moderately improve markedly improve overall symptom compare baseline 7-point global response assessment ( GRA ) scale . The GRA scale involve ask question , `` As compare start current study , would rate overall symptom ? '' . There 7 possible response : markedly bad , moderately bad , slightly bad , , slightly improve , moderately improve markedly improve . This scale current standard outcome study evaluate treatment intervention IC/PBS . There number secondary outcome variable include : change 24 hour void diary course intervention , rating bladder pain , urinary urgency urinary frequency standardize scale , score O'Leary-Sant IC Symptom Problem Index , score validated questionnaire pelvic floor general health . The investigator also collect report adverse event . Subjects recruit routine visit University California , Irvine ( UCI ) urogynecology division patient schedule initiate continue routine care complaint . If provider feel patient may appropriate study meet inclusion/exclusion criterion , offer study investigator speak patient time late time patient 's convenience . Once consent sign , subject provide following material complete first treatment visit : 1. demographic medical history survey 2 . 24 hour void diary 3. visual analog scale ( VAS ) bladder pain 4 . Pelvic Pain Urgency/Frequency Patient Symptom Scale ( PUF Questionnaire ) 5 . O'Leary-Sant IC Symptom Problem Index 6. urine pregnancy test ( premenopausal subject ) The PTNS treatment visit administer standard fashion . This involve placement thin needle ( similar acupuncture needle ) insert near posterior ankle . The needle connected electrode stimulator stimulation adjust appropriate response ( toe flex fan ) obtain without patient discomfort . When appropriate level , electrode stimulate 30 minute per treatment session . Study visit conduct UCI Ob/Gyn clinic nurse train administer PTNS . These treatment occur weekly 12 week . ( See Section 2.4 table outline treatment visit . ) At visit , nurse inquire regard adverse reaction treatment subject complete VAS . After completion twelfth treatment visit , subject request complete following : 1 . 7-point global response assessment ( GRA ) scale interval medical history questionnaire 2 . 24 hour void diary 3. visual analog scale ( VAS ) bladder pain 4 . Pelvic Pain Urgency/Frequency Patient Symptom Scale ( PUF Questionnaire ) 5 . O'Leary-Sant IC Symptom Problem Index These form return within two week subject return clinic follow visit provider . At time , depend current symptom response treatment GRA scale , subject offer continue PTNS treatment maintenance interval pursue alternative care outside study protocol benefit obtain . If subject plan continue maintenance treatment , ask wish continue additional follow 12-16 week final treatment visit . The information collect time follow : 1 . 7-point global response assessment ( GRA ) scale interval medical history questionnaire 2 . 24 hour void diary 3. visual analog scale ( VAS ) bladder pain 4 . Pelvic Pain Urgency/Frequency Patient Symptom Scale ( PUF Questionnaire ) 5 . O'Leary-Sant IC Symptom Problem Index 6 . Post-study follow-up survey</detailed_description>
