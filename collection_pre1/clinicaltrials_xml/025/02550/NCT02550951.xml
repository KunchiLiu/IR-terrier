	<brief_title>Utility MR Lymphangiography Postoperative Follow-up Lymphedema : Comparison With Lymphoscintigraphy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Surgical method include `` surgical procedure make good lymphatic drain 'and ' surgical resection lymph tissue swell , significant two lymphedema .In recent year , begin receive spotlight former method use micro-surgery , inde essential order increase success rate micro-surgery accurately assess structural abnormality preoperative lymphatic establish surgical plan , primary diagnostic imaging examination exist lymphedema Since nuclear medicine examination obtain accurate anatomical information also ideal image preoperative assessment lymphedema precisely . In contrast magnetic resonance lymphangiography recently develop new magnetic resonance image technique many advantage precision assessment lymphedema patient . First , high spatial resolution magnetic resonance lymphangiography lymphatic vessel obtain correct anatomical information . Second , magnetic resonance lymphangiography provide information functional status lymphatic anatomical information . Third , magnetic resonance lymphangiography minimally invasive technique , without exposure radiation , relatively easy safe , great advantage able diagnose structural functional time later lymphatic vessel . The magnetic resonance lymphangiography via lymphatic advantage give also help establish specific treatment plan , well accurate preoperative diagnosis lymphedema may contribute enhance success micro-surgery .</detailed_description>
