	<brief_summary>Until recently , Mount Sinai Hospital , epidural analgesia labor pain deliver pump could provide continuous infusion freeze medication combination push medication activate patient , technique call patient control epidural analgesia ( PCEA ) . In last decade , literature suggest continuous infusion medication effective previously think , suggest instead continuous infusion , intermittent program push use . The investigator device able . Programmed intermittent epidural bolus ( PIEB ) new technological advance base concept bolus freeze medication epidural space superior continuous epidural infusion ( CEI ) . The new pump able deliver bolus medication regular interval ( PIEB ) , addition patient deliver ( PCEA ) . Studies show deliver analgesia manner prolong duration analgesia , diminish motor block , low incidence breakthrough pain , improve maternal satisfaction decrease local anesthetic consumption . Based information already available literature , study aim determine best regimen PIEB achievable standard epidural mixture . The hypothesis study optimal interval time PIEB boluses 30 60 minute fix volume 10 ml standard epidural mixture provide woman necessary drug requirement , thus avoid breakthrough pain need PCEA physician intervention .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All study involve PIEB date provide analgesic regimen deliver amount local anesthetic patient 's requirement per hour , study do context association PCEA ( Patient control epidural anesthesia ) rescue technique . As result , PCEA request frequent therefore study able truly understand pharmacology bolus technique PIEB regimen , PCEA utilize patient add extra component regimen . The ideal volume interval time PIEB bolus yet establish literature . Most likely ideal volume interval time PIEB bolus specific epidural mixture . At Mount Sinai Hospital , PIEB device recently introduce . Currently standard epidural mixture bupivacaine 0.0625 % fentanyl 2mcg/ml . Our current epidural regimen consist 10 ml continuous infusion per hour , PCEA boluses 5 ml lock interval 10 minute , maximum 20 ml epidural mixture per hour . In study , investigator offer patient 10mL PIEBs bupivacaine 0.0625 % fentanyl 2mcg/ml 4 different interval . PCEA bolus 5mL solution also available . The goal establish ideal PIEB regimen effective patient population standard epidural mixture . Finding best way use new device able provide analgesia 90 % parturients represent great improvement labor analgesia . Moreover , expectation few side effect since PIEB effective CEI .</detailed_description>
