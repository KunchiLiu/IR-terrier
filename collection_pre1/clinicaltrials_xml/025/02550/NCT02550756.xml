	<criteria>1 . Male female subject age &gt; /=18 year time Screening Visit . 2 . Symptoms intermetatarsal neuroma least 30 day prior Screening Visit . 3 . Diagnosis intermetatarsal neuroma ( Morton 's neuroma ) base medical history physical examination evidence focal tenderness pain area neuroma , confirm ultrasound image modality . Typically subject sensory symptom distribution affect common digital nerve . However , provide imaging study positive , presence sensory symptom require . The neuroma may either second third intermetatarsal space . 4 . An average pain score 4.0 9.0 ( 7 day prior dose ) Numeric Pain Rating Scale ( NPRS ) , rat daily bedtime average pain walk last 24 hour , relevant affected foot . At least 4 7 score week prior dose must record . 5 . For female subject : reproductive status subject surgically sterile , least 2 year postmenopausal , use medically acceptable method birth control ; childbearing potential , pregnant ( negative urine pregnancy test prior enrollment ) , plan get pregnant course study , lactate . 6 . Willing able understand study requirement , abide study restriction , complete study procedure , pain scale , diary , communicate meaningfully study personnel . 7 . Signed Informed Consent Form approve Institutional Review Board . 1 . Clinically significant bursitis another significant symptomatic condition region adjoin neuroma . 2 . The subject one intermetatarsal neuroma foot inject ( index foot ) . 3 . Prior use injection sclerosing agent alcohol phenol , prior surgery intermetatarsal neuroma affected foot . 4 . Prior injection corticosteroid index foot oral use corticosteroid within 30 day screen . 5 . The subject another painful condition , judgment investigator , would interfere subject 's ability evaluate pain functional limitation arise intermetatarsal neuroma . 6 . Other painful foot pathology ( e.g. , bunion , hammertoe , plantar fasciitis , etc . ) evidence clinically meaningful ischemia opinion investigator would interfere evaluation symptom functional limitation arise intermetatarsal neuroma . For example , subject pain bunion pain easily distinguish subject neuroma pain , subject would still candidate study . Note , however , subject also able distinguish neuroma pain bunion pain term foot function . In general , another foot pain condition ( foot ) give rise pain great neuroma pain , subject instance exclude . 7 . Signs arterial insufficiency foot . 8 . Ulcer and/or wind foot affected neuroma . 9 . Active cutaneous disease , anatomical physiological foot disorder , anticipate site study drug injection . 10 . History clearly document allergic reaction local anesthetic capsaicin . 11 . Presence medical condition instability , judgment Investigator , might adversely impact conduct study result data , include chronic condition likely alter rate heal likely result safety complication unrelated study medication , uncontrolled diabetes mellitus vascular disease . 12 . Clinically significant laboratory result Screening Visit ( opinion Investigator ) . 13 . Has diabetic neuropathy length dependent neuropathy . 14 . Use investigational medication 30 day prior current study , schedule receive agent participate study , receive topical injected investigational medication index foot within past 60 day . 15 . Use topical medication index foot within 7 day screen ( include lidocaine capsaicin ) . 16 . Prior participation ALGRX 4975 study . 17 . History substance abuse disorder within past year define DSMIV , current evidence substance abuse disorder , receive medicinal treatment drug abuse , test positive upon urine drug screen substance abuse . 18 . Has condition take medication would contraindicate study participation .</criteria>
