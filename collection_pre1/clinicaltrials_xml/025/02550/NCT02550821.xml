	<brief_summary>The purpose study compare physical activity level patient bronchiectasis healthy subject . We hypothesize patient bronchiectasis low level physical activity , since physical activity level affect reduced exercise tolerance , severity disease disease relate symptoms condition .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Physical Activity Level Between Patients With Bronchiectasis Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physical activity limitation chronic respiratory disease cause many factor include respiratory , hemodynamic , peripheral muscle weakness . Bronchiectasis characterize irreversible widen medium-sized airway , inflammation , chronic bacterial infection destruction bronchial wall . In addition pulmonary function worsening , extra pulmonary feature reduce peripheral muscle endurance significant physical problem cause decrease physical activity level . Despite physical activity consider essential management chronic respiratory disease , lack scientific study , compare physical activity level patient bronchiectasis healthy subject . This study assess physical activity level , exercise capacity , quality life peripheral muscle strength patient bronchiectasis compare healthy subject .</detailed_description>
