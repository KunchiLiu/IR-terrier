	<brief_title>Prospective , Randomized Study Predicting Human Cytomegalovirus ( hCMV ) Infection Based Baseline hCMV Specific T-cell Response Kidney Transplant</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human cytomegalovirus ( hCMV ) common opportunistic pathogen first month solid organ transplantation . Traditionally , hCMV infection renal transplant patient indirectly associate increase risk acute rejection , chronic graft dysfunction , graft loss even increase patient mortality . The susceptibility develop hCMV infection essentially determine immune status donor receptor regard virus , whereby seronegative recipient ( IgG ) receive graft seropositive donor ( IgG + ) group patient particularly high risk develop hCMV infection disease . In fact , without administration preventative therapy hCMV , 60 70 % population risk infection ( presence virus blood ) approximately 20 % develop associate systemic disease ( viral invasion tissue ) . Interestingly , incidence hCMV infection patient seropositive HIV virus receive graft 20 % , increase 30 % give cell depletion therapies polyclonal antibody administer transplantation . There currently two treatment option prevent infection hCMV ; One prophylactic , whereby antiviral therapy administer orally 90 100 day transplantation patient consider risk ( donor IgG+ , recipient IgG- ) second pre-emptive therapy , presence virus peripheral blood monitor periodically transplantation appear ( present polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) detection viral nucleic acid ) , thus trigger need intensive antiviral therapy . When compare pharmacological intervention , therapeutic strategy demonstrate significant reduction development hCMV herpes virus type disease , even decrease incidence acute graft rejection . However , prospective randomize study compare effectiveness two therapeutic alternative . Recently , German group prospectively compare efficacy prophylactic oral ganciclovir versus intravenous ganciclovir therapy group 148 patient receive high serological risk renal transplant hCMV . Interestingly , group receive prophylactic oral therapy high graft survival 4 year follow ( uncensored death ) group receive ganciclovir , suggest , despite administration intensive intravenous therapy time detection virus blood , potential deleterious effect virus organs initial asymptomatic period could explain benefit prophylactic therapy beginning . These result important implication , clinical socioeconomic , seem imply need systemic prophylaxis prevent development viral infection patient currently consider risk ( R -/D + ) . Moreover , another interesting study compare primary prophylaxis oral valganciclovir versus early therapy prevention ( pre-emptive therapy ) large group kidney transplant recipient different serologic donor / recipient combination , show significantly high rate viremia CMV disease patient receive treatment incidence serological CMV infection 53 % serological R + / R + combination . In sense , late international consensus guideline indicate type therapy ( early prophylactic ) acceptable , degree moderately high evidence , group seropositive patient receive graft seropositive donor . The investigator unit adopt pre-emptive protocol last two year , systematically monitor viral replication R + / D + pair , except patient receive immunosuppressive therapy Thymoglobulin investigator assign prophylactic treatment oral valganciclovir 3 months.This change introduce 2 year ago prophylactic treatment give R + / R + patient . This change lead improved result term prevention cytomegalic infection . All discrepancy among study result examine efficacy various therapeutic strategy prevent hCMV could explain poor diagnostic capability currently available identify patient truly high risk develop cytomegalic infection . This illustrated fact hCMV infection reappears patient ( 15-20 % ) transplantation even though seropositive ( R+ ) , majority patient receive prophylactic treatment never develop cytomegalic infection discontinuation , small percentage ( 10-15 % ) still , , even though 70-80 % seronegative ( R- ) patient receive seropositive graft ( R+ ) develop post-transplant hCMV infection unless receive prophylactic treatment , approximately 20-30 % never . All lead important therapeutic contradiction field , even though majority seropositive recipient develop hCMV infection , still receive intense costly monitoring viremia , , although large majority patient receive prophylactic treatment develop infection upon treatment discontinuation , continue prophylactic antiviral treatment propose across clinical transplantation community , suggest immune surveillance risk develop post-transplant hCMV infection currently poor clinical practice . It well establish memory/effector T-cells play pivotal role control general viral replication survival , particularly hCMV . Even though report cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells activate myriad immunogenic hCMV viral protein , predominant robust response direct immediate early antigen-1 ( IE-1 ) phosphoprotein 65 ( pp65 ) , think play critical role control hCMV replication . Recently publish study suggest cellular response even important control prevention infection transplantation . All publication , however , refer post-transplantation period patient effect chronic immunosuppressive therapy evaluate T-cell response use assay hardly applicable routine clinical practice . Even though available , assay use routine clinical practice evaluate hCMV-specific immune response . One precise functional assay assess memory cell humoral response evaluation interferon-γ ELISPOT assay . This assay measure antigen-specific memory response frequency individual cell become stimulated . Recent work transplantation establish detection highly alloreactive circulate donor-specific T-cells ELISPOT offer prognostic value assess risk acute rejection chronic post-transplant graft dysfunction . Likewise , ELISPOT show able detect highly reactive hCMV-specific T-cells associate low risk viral infection sensitivity specificity . The investigator group recently publish low frequency rate specific hCMV ( IE-1 ) T-cells transplantation identify renal transplant recipient high risk post-transplant hCMV infection precision , regardless therapeutic strategy adopt hCMV . Remarkably , result observe patient receive induction therapy polyclonal antibody ( Thymoglobuline ® ) . The investigator thus believe assay approach would allow identify precision patient risk develop infection regardless hCMV serology status .</detailed_description>
