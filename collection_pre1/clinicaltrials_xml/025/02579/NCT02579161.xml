	<brief_title>Trial Randomized Antibiotic Administration Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>For large renal stone burden and/or complex stone , Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy ( PCNL ) become mainstay treatment , replace open kidney stone surgery since 's introduction 1976 . However , PCNL without complication , specifically infectious . The procedure carry 25 % incidence infectious complication approximately 1 % rate severe sepsis even completely sterile condition . Therefore , use antibiotic become paramount , date PNCL specific guideline appropriate duration class antibiotic . This fact leave practice urologist subjective experience guide . In addition , age increase number resistant microbe judicious use antibiotic even paramount . The investigator project , purpose randomize intention treat prospective study explore duration type antibiotic large population previously study . The investigator hypothesize difference complication two group : 1 ) 24 hour perioperative antibiotic versus 2 ) Continued antibiotic removal external catheter . The investigator model antibiotic choice duration 2013 American Urological Association , ( AUA ) Urologic Surgery Antimicrobial Prophylaxis recommendation , modify local antibiogram necessary . The investigator ' objective compare clinical efficacy single-day protocol short-course protocol PCNL . Our hope reduce use possibly unnecessary prolong antibiotic use , reduce hospital cost prevent propagation resistant microbe . Antibiotic detail : cephalosporin aminoglycoside + metronidazole clindamycin alternative allergy aminoglycoside/ sulbactam fluoroquinolone Looking drug dose variable timeframe medication</detailed_description>
