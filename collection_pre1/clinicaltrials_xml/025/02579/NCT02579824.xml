If test perform recently , may need repeat . On Day 8 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . - Blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn pharmacokinetic ( PK ) biomarker test dose study drug . PK test measure amount study drug body different time point . On Day 15 Cycle 1 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . - You EKG .

You may procedure performed anytime Day 24 Cycle 1 Day 5 Cycle 2 . On Days 8 15 Cycle 2 , blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . On Day 1 Cycle 3 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test check status disease . If become pregnant , routine blood urine collection include pregnancy test . On Day 1 Cycles 4 beyond : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test check status disease . - If doctor think need , bone survey . - If doctor think need , bone marrow biopsy and/or aspirate check status disease biomarker cytogenetic testing . Length Study : You may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Your participation study complete follow-up . End-of-Treatment Visit : Within 30 day last dose study drug : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test check status disease . If become pregnant , routine collection include pregnancy test . Follow-Up Visit : About 30 day last dose study drug , contact either phone clinic visit find drug take . If call , take 5 minute . This investigational study . DS-3032b FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 28 participant enrol study .

	<criteria>1 . Subjects must relapse and/or refractory myeloma measurable disease , define least one following : *Serum Mprotein level &gt; /=0.5 g/dL Immunoglobulin G ( IgG ) , Immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) , Immunoglobulin M ( IgM ) disease ; * Mprotein total serum Immunoglobulin D ( IgD ) &gt; /=0.5 g/dL IgD disease ; * Urinary Myeloma ( M ) protein excretion &gt; /= 200 mg 24hour period ; * Involved free light chain level &gt; /=10 mg/dL , along abnormal free light chain ratio . 2 . Subjects must least three line therapy disease , include proteasome inhibitor immunomodulatory drug ( e.g. , lenalidomide ) , line therapy separate presence document disease progression . Using definition , treatment induction therapy , follow high dose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplantation , finally maintenance therapy , would constitute one line , provide multiple myeloma meet criterion progression time period . 3 . Subjects must disease relapsed and/or refractory recent therapy , progressive disease ( PD ) define increase 25 % low response value one following : *Serum Mprotein ( absolute increase must &gt; /=0.5 g/dL ) and/or ; * Urine Mprotein ( absolute increase must &gt; /=200 mg/24 hour ) and/or ; * Only subject without measurable serum urine M protein level : difference involve uninvolved free light chain ( FLC ) level ( absolute increase ) must &gt; 10 mg/dL ; * Definite development new bone lesion soft tissue plasmacytoma definite increase size exist bone lesion soft tissue plasmacytoma ; * Development hypercalcemia ( correct serum calcium &gt; 11.5 mg/dL ) attribute solely plasma cell proliferative disorder . 4 . Subjects know polyneuropathyorganomegalyendocrinopathyM proteinskin lesion ( POEMS ) syndrome , subject myeloma amyloidosis eligible measurable disease define . 5 . Subjects must complete recent drug therapy direct multiple myeloma follow timeframes : * Chemotherapy , biological therapy , immunotherapy , investigational therapy least 2 week prior start DS3032b ; * Corticosteroids least 2 week prior start DS3032b , except dose equivalent dexamethasone &gt; /=4 mg/day ; * Nitrosoureas , nitrogen mustard , mitomycin C , monoclonal antibody least 6 week prior start DS3032b ; * Autologous stem cell transplantation least 12 week prior start DS3032b ; * Allogeneic stem cell transplantation least 24 week prior start DS3032b , subject must also NOT moderate severe active acute chronic graft versus host disease ( GVHD ) . 6 . # 5 cont ... * Previous concurrent use hormone replacement therapy , use gonadotropinreleasing hormone modulators prostate cancer , use somatostatin analog neuroendocrine tumor permit therapy change within 8 week study drug treatment . 7 .

Subject receive therapy intend treat malignancy within 21 day first receipt DS3032b 3 . Subjects malignancy contain nonsynonymous mutation , insertion , deletion TP53 gene determine previously screen . 4 . Subjects known central nervous system involvement multiple myeloma exclude clinical trial poor prognosis often develop progressive neurologic dysfunction would confound evaluation neurologic adverse event . 5 . Subjects know history allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition DS3032b . 6 . Subjects uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement , opinion Principal Investigator . 7 .

Subjects require plasmapheresis exchange le 2 week prior initiation therapy DS3032b . 12 . Subjects `` currently active '' second malignancy , nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix , enrol . Subjects consider `` currently active '' malignancy complete therapy prior malignancy , disease free prior malignancy &gt; 5 year , consider physician less 30 % risk relapse . In addition , subject basal squamous cell carcinoma skin , superficial carcinoma bladder , carcinoma prostate current prostatespecific antigen ( PSA ) value &lt; 0.5 ng/mL , cervical intraepithelial neoplasia eligible . Finally , subject hormonal therapy history either prostate cancer breast cancer may enroll , provide evidence disease progression previous three year . 13 . Substance abuse medical , psychological , social condition , opinion Investigator , may interfere subject 's participation clinical study evaluation clinical study result . 14 . Subjects prior treatment MDM2 inhibitor . 15 . Nonclinical study indicate DS3032b metabolize CYP3A4/5 . Drugs strong inhibitor inducer enzyme may alter PK DS3032b therefore avoid . St. John 's wort ( hypericin ) therefore permit 30 day participation study . Because DS3032b substrate CYP3A4/5 grapefruit juice CYP3A4/5 inhibitor , food beverage contain grapefruit take within 48 hour initial dose study drug throughout duration study .</criteria>
