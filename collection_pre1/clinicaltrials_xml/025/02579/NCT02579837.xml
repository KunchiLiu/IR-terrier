	<brief_summary>Diabetic eye disease cause major vision loss many Canadians costly . There effective prevention treatment diabetic eye disease strongly depend upon regular screen asymptomatic patient . The 2013 Canadian Diabetes Association ( CDA ) guideline recommend annual screening eye care professional , either in-person interpretation dilate pupil retinal photograph . Despite benefit screen , adherence guideline poor . Reasons include patient barrier , i.e . need eye drop , time work , wait time , transportation issue . An option minimize barrier screen use camera call non-mydriatic ultra-widefield ( UWF ) retinal imaging . This quickly do without eye drop day patient ' regularly schedule diabetes clinic visit . In study , investigator compare UWF camera usual screening approach recommend CDA . The investigator invite 740 patient diabetes due eye screen either screen use UWF camera day diabetes clinic visit screen usual eye care professional . The investigator ' prediction same-day screening UWF imaging find patient diabetic eye disease need treatment compare usual screening .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>CLEAR SIGHT : A Trial Non-Mydriatic Ultra-Widefield Retinal Imaging Screen Diabetic Eye Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In study , investigator address significant expand `` care-gap '' question patient diabetes risk diabetic retinopathy ( DR ) . DR major cause impair health-related quality life Ontarians visual loss include blindness . Because prevalence DM Ontario increase , number Ontarians age 40 year sight-threatening DR project increase ~ 60 % 2031 . DR also major source health care cost : 2007 estimate health care system expenditure vision loss DR Canada $ 205 million . There proven effective strategy prevent treat DR . These strategy strongly depend upon regular screen asymptomatic patient . Thus , 2013 CDA practice guideline recommend annual eye screen experience eye care professional either in-person interpretation dilate pupil retinal photograph yet , despite benefit screening , adherence CDA guideline poor . At least part due patient-centered barrier include need mydriasis , time work , wait time , transportation issue . Recent study indicate non-mydriatic UWF retinal imaging minimize barrier also accurately detect clinically important DR compare reference standard test ( dilate pupil eye exam eye care professional 7-field stereoscopic colour fundus photography ) . In study , investigator ' primary goal confirm refute hypothesis screen non-mydriatic UWF imaging time diabetes patient see routinely schedule diabetes clinic visit ( On-site Screening ) improve rate detection clinically important DR compare Usual Screening CDA guideline . While investigator test effect screen non-mydriatic UWF visual outcome , confirmation investigator ' hypothesis potential improve current screening strategy DR Ontario , , expectation reduce vision-threatening diabetic eye disease .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Known diagnosis Type 1 diabetes &gt; /= 5 year Type 2 diabetes duration 2 . At least 12 month since last screening diabetic eye disease eye care professional base patient selfreport . Subsequent confirmation date last eye examination obtain via communication patient 's eye care professional . Patients indicate selfreport year since screening , subsequently confirm last screen occur &lt; 12 month prior entry , randomize include primary analysis compare OnSite Usual Screening . 3 . Provision inform consent 1 . Under active followup ophthalmologist DMrelated eye disease . Active followup require , recruitment , patient schedule future ophthalmologist appointment reason . 2 . Inability provide inform consent . 3 . Any condition circumstance judgment investigator make unlikely patient adhere study protocol . This include comorbidities expect lifeexpectancy less year .</criteria>
