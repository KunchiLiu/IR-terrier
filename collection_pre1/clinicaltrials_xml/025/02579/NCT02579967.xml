	<brief_summary>Background : Allogeneic blood marrow transplant stem cell take one person blood bone marrow give another person . Researchers think may help people immune system problem . Objective : To see allogeneic blood bone marrow transplant safe effective treat people primary immunodeficiency . Eligibility : Donors : Healthy people age 4 old Recipients : People age 4-75 primary immunodeficiency may treat allogeneic blood marrow transplant Design : Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood test . Participants urine test , EKG , chest x-ray . Donors : Bone marrow harvest : With anesthesia , marrow take needle hipbone . OR Blood collection : They several drug injection 5 7 day . Blood take IV one arm , circulate machine remove stem cell , return IV arm . Possible vein assessment pre-anesthesia evaluation Recipients : Lung test , heart test , radiology scan , CT scan , dental exam Possible tissue biopsy lumbar puncture Bone marrow small piece bone remove needle hipbone . Chemotherapy 1-2 week transplant day Donor stem cell donation catheter put vein chest neck Several-week hospital stay . They take medication may need blood transfusion additional procedure . After discharge , recipient : Remain near clinic 3 month . They weekly visit may require hospital readmission . Have multiple follow-up visit clinic first 6 month , less frequently least 5 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background : - Primary immunodeficiency disease ( PIDs ) condition associate major quantitative qualitative immunologic abnormality , case , due defect cell hematopoietic origin - Patients PID life-threatening complication include malignancy , recurrent infection , autoimmunity/immune dysregulation - Allogeneic blood marrow transplantation ( allo BMT ) potential cure immune defect PID thereby reduce morbidity mortality associate diseases Objectives : -To estimate acute graft-versus-host disease ( aGVHD ) -free , graft failure-free survival day +180 allo BMT , analyze separately condition arm/cohort Eligibility : - Patients age great equal 4 75 year - PID deem sufficient past severity warrant allo BMT , meet two criterion : - PID define monogenetic mutation , absence mutation , patient immune defect potentially amenable allo BMT meet clinical history criterion may eligible - Clinical history least two follow : - Life-threatening , organ-threatening , severely disfigure infection - Protracted recurrent infection - Infection opportunistic organism - Chronic elevation blood latent virus - Evidence immune dysregulation - Hypogammaglobulinemia/dysglobulinemia - Hematologic malignancy lymphoproliferative disorder - Virus-associated solid tumor malignancy pre-cancerous lesion - A least one 9-10/10 HLA-matched related unrelated donor , HLA-haploidentical relate donor - Adequate end-organ function - Consensus opinion investigative team patient potential benefit transplant despite exist , non-hematopoietic organ dysfunction - Not pregnant breastfeed - HIV negative - Disease status : patient malignancy refer remission evaluation , except case virus-associated malignancy may refer time Design : - The study three conditioning arm vary intensity . Patients age &gt; 65 eligible either reduced-intensity conditioning ( RIC ) immunosuppression-only ( IOC ) arm . The IOC arm standard risk high risk cohort . - IOC arm : pentostatin 4 mg/m ( 2 ) /day IV day -9 -5 , low-dose cyclophosphamide orally daily day -9 -2 - RIC arm : pentostatin 4 mg/m ( 2 ) /day IV day -11 -7 , low-dose cyclophosphamide orally daily day -11 -4 ; busulfan IV , pharmokinetically dose , day -3 -2 . - Myeloablative ( MAC ) arm : pentostatin 4 mg/m ( 2 ) /day IV day -13 -9 , low-dose cyclophosphamide orally daily day -13 -6 ; busulfan IV , pharmokinetically dose , day -5 , -4 , -3 , -2 . - Patients assign MAC arm one follow present : - Splenomegaly attributable underlie PID - Evidence primary hematologic marrow malignancy proliferative process , unless myelosuppressive therapy give 3 month prior start condition - PID experience show MAC need fully reverse disease phenotype - Patients may assign standard risk cohort IOC arm one follow present : - DNA repair telomere maintenance defect , familial cancer predisposition syndrome - PID absent low number T-lymphocytes - Severely hypocellular aplastic bone marrow , without clonal abnormality evidence myelodysplastic syndrome - In 3 month prior plan start allo BMT conditioning , receipt cytotoxic chemotherapy , hypomethylating agent , targeted/immunomodulatory therapy antiproliferative effect marrow - PID experience show minimal conditioning necessary successful engraftment T- myeloid lineages - Patients may assign high risk cohort IOC arm significant end-organ dysfunction present felt condition regimen include busulfan would likely associate intolerable , life-threatening toxicity patient . - Patients meet criterion MAC IOC arm receive RIC . However , condition arm assignment may ultimately deviate criterion base patient disease factor - Bone marrow prefer graft source . Peripheral blood stem cell permit - GVHD prophylaxis : - High-dose , posttransplantation cyclophosphamide ( PTCy ) day +3 +4 , sirolimus day +5 +180 , mycophenolate mofetil ( MMF ) day +5 +35 . - Patients DNA repair/telomere defect familial cancer syndrome may receive reduce dose ( 25mg/kg/day ) PTCy day +3 +4 , addition sirolimus MMF . - Donor cell infusion : CD34+ select stem cell boost donor lymphocyte infusion ( DLI ) - patient without active grade 2 high GVHD eligible receive stem cell boost DLI allo BMT need mixed chimerism , relapse hematologic malignancy , EBV-posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder</detailed_description>

PID define monogenetic mutation , absence PIDassociated genetic mutation , patient immune defect potentially amenable allo BMT meet clinical history criterion may eligible upon discussion PI Mutations confirm CLIAcertified laboratory , test available . Patients without mutation must deem eligible appropriate allo BMT PI . Some patient may meet clinical history criterion list , eligible thought clinical history due condition apart immune defect . In addition , patient PID mild severity , selective IgA deficiency , may meet least two clinical history criterion , may deem inappropriate allo BMT PI felt risk procedure outweigh severity disease . All mutation test perform NIAID protocol ( 07I0033 Detection Characterization Infections Infection Susceptibility ; PI : Steve Holland ) , genetic counseling education establish protocol . 2 .
