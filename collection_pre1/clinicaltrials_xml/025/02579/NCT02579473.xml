	<brief_title>A Study Weekly Subcutaneous Injections SER-214 Subjects With Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) , Determine Safety , Tolerability Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) Profile SER-214</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Clinical evidence suggest dopamine agonist consider initial early symptomatic therapy PD . Current information indicate early use long-acting dopaminergic agonist may protect development motor complication stimulate dopamine receptor non-pulsatile manner delay introduction levodopa . In pre-clinical primate study , L-dopa ( short-acting , pulsatile ) dopaminergic agonist ( long-acting ; non pulsatile ) provide comparable clinical benefit agonist induce significantly less dyskinesia . Chronic L-dopa treat animal develop gene change associate abnormal neuronal firing pattern dyskinesias see long-acting dopamine agonist . Based pre-clinical clinical study result , treatment Parkinson 's patient long-acting levodopa dopamine agonist provide symptomatic benefit , significantly delay onset motor complication . This accomplished duodopa continuous sc apomorphine treatment associate significant side effect . To date , practical method provide continuous drug delivery use dopaminergic agent therapy patient early PD prevent development motor complication advance clinical trial . SER-214 develop weekly sc injection provide prompt onset dopaminergic stimulation . Continuous level release rotigotine within therapeutic window relief motor fluctuation observe MPTP-treated cynomolgus macaque . PK determination normal monkey 13 week treatment show weekly injection SER-214 provide continuous drug delivery release plasma rotigotine within predictable therapeutic range .</detailed_description>
