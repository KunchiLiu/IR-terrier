	<brief_summary>The aim present study evaluate superiority fix triple therapy BDP/FF/GB daily dose 400/24/50 mcg respectively Ultibro® Breezhaler® ( DPI ) , fix combination indacaterol 85 mcg glycopyrronium 43 mcg COPD patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>2-arm Parallel Group Study Fixed Combination CHF 5993 v Ultibro® COPD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Outpatients attend hospital clinics/study centre recruit . Patients severe severe COPD airflow obstruction accord GOLD 2014 criterion . A total approximately 2192 patient need screen order obtain 1534 ( 767 per arm ) randomize evaluable patient . Approximately 200 site involve worldwide . Each patient perform total 8 clinic visit ( V0 V7 ) study . The Primary objective demonstrate superiority CHF 5993 pMDI Ultibro® term moderate severe COPD exacerbation rate 52 week treatment . The Secondary objective : 1 . To evaluate effect CHF 5993 pMDI lung function parameter , patient 's health status clinical outcome measure ; 2 . To assess safety tolerability study treatment . A 2-week open-label run-in period Ultibro® follow 52-week randomised treatment period . The trial design optimised measure exacerbation rate use Exacerbations Chronic Pulmonary Disease Tool ( EXACT ) , develop mean collect patient-reported outcome ( PRO ) data , help capture frequency exacerbation .</detailed_description>
