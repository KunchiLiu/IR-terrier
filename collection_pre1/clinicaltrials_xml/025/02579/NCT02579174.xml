	<brief_title>Total Knee Replacement Component Alignment Using Manual Versus Custom Instrumentation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Achieving optimal prosthetic alignment femoral , tibial patellar component Total Knee Replacement ( TKR ) great importance contributes well function , less pain improved quality life.TKR require accuracy execution bone cut correct orientation coronal , sagittal axial plane . Malposition potentially lead increased mechanical stress bearing surface inevitably earlier loosening . Computed Axial Tomography ( CT ) gold standard technique evaluate implant alignment coronal , sagittal axial plane . As , CT image use create custom instrumentation purport likely improvement surgical outcome . Customized instrumentation create preoperative CT show safe effective , report difference patient outcomes similar total knee arthroplasty component alignment . However , take consideration CT 's high level radiation , cost expense inability obtain image limb weight-bearing position , CT scan use routinely postoperative tool evaluate TKR implant positioning . The imaging system manufacture EOS Imaging ( formerly Biospace Med , Paris ) biplanar , low-dose radiation , full body , high resolution , radiological imaging system allow simultaneous acquisition coronal sagittal plane stand position.EOS ' main benefit considerable reduction radiation dose ( 1000 time less CT ten time less plain radiography ) use gaseous detector . George Charpak , inventor , award Nobel Prize 1992 work . Moreover , EOS system provide 3D image use appropriate software algorithm , thus provide low-radiation alternative CT .</detailed_description>
