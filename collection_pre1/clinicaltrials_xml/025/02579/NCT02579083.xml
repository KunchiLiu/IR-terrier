	<brief_title>Vaginal Antibody Safety Trial : Safety Study Monoclonal Antibodies Reduce Vaginal Transmission Herpes Simplex Virus ( HSV ) Human Immunodeficiency Virus ( HIV )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This single center , Phase 1 , randomize , single blind , placebo-controlled , two-segment study ass safety MB66 vaginal film . After appropriate screening , approximately 43 healthy woman enrol . The study divide two sequential Segments . The first , Segment A , single-arm , single-dose , open label design . The 8 Segment A participant receive single dose one full MB66 film . After dose , subject ask maintain sexual abstinence evaluate person Day 1 ( 24-hours post MB66 administration ) , telephone Day 3 4 person Day 6-10 Exit Visit , subject allow resume sexual activity study-provided condom three week last exposure film ( avoid male exposure residual drug product ) . A placebo arm include Segment A , low risk toxicity placebo film make unlikely toxicity observe Segment A would wrongly attribute active agent ( mAbs ) MB66 film . This conclusion base know tolerance similar vehicle use commercial polyvinyl alcohol ( PVA ) -based vaginal film ( VCF® ) , absence toxicity MB66 placebo film sensitive rabbit model substantially high dose intensity duration . Completion Segment A safety review Segment A adverse event trigger initiation Segment B , repeat dose , randomize , two arm , single-blind , placebo-controlled design . Subjects randomized 1:1 two group ( 15 evaluable subject per group ) treat daily either 1 MB66 film 1 vehicle control placebo film seven consecutive day . For five day , 7 day dose period , subject ask maintain period sexual abstinence . Subjects evaluate person Day 0 ( 1 4 hour post MB66 in-clinic dosing ) , Day 1 ( 24 hr post dosing ) , telephone Day 3-4 , evaluate person Day 7-8 , , subject allow resumed sexual activity condom require three week last film insertion . Subjects evaluate last time Day 12-16 Exit Visit . In addition safety measure , pharmacokinetic evaluation do Day 0 , Day 1 , Day 7 Segments , additionally Day 14 Segment B . Specifically , study evaluate rate MB66 film dissolution , vaginal concentration MB66 antibody , degree systemic absorption MB66 antibody . A number exploratory objective also evaluate , include assessment antiviral effect MB66 antibodies ex vivo cervicovaginal lavage fluid participant dose MB66 film , effect MB66 placebo film cervicovaginal microbial environment use pH , Nugent score , bacterial ribosomal DNA polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) , comparison effect MB66 placebo film cervicovaginal immune mediator Luminex ELISA assay . Segment B participant also ask assess acceptability MB66 vaginal film 7 day use .</detailed_description>
