	<brief_summary>Ketamine use successfully sole medication anesthesia set electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) , recently study adjunct agent combination propofol ( commonly use anesthetic agent ) induce anesthesia ECT . New literature postulate anti-depressant effect ketamine , ECT specifically may helpful regard overall goal therapy ( i.e . ECT indicate severe treatment-resistant depression ) . Current research focus ketamine respect anti-depressant effect suggest may even represent alternative ECT . This study seek determine whether ketamine use low-doses adjunct propofol-based anesthesia ECT anti-depressant effect whether influence characteristic recovery anesthesia ECT setting ( i.e . vital sign parameter blood pressure heart rate , quality recovery , etc . ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Low-dose Ketamine Adjunct Propofol-based Anesthesia Electroconvulsive Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This proof-of-concept study elucidate whether use low-dose ketamine adjunct propofol-based anesthesia electroconvulsive therapy beneficial anti-depressant effect population adult major depressive disorder present ECT . Since thiopental longer widely available North America induction agent anesthesia , agent supplant various us , include induction anesthesia electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) . Induction commonly achieve use propofol dose 0.75 - 1 mg/kg IV bolus . Propofol induction agent ECT may ideal agent set anticonvulsant effect may result less-than-ideal seizure quality duration . Ketamine study ECT set full induction dose well-known psychotomimetic dissociative effect . However , anti-depressant effect ketamine , even low-doses , may beneficial effect depressive symptom ECT compare propofol alone . Ketamine also use successfully sole induction agent anesthesia setting , recently study adjunct co-induction agent combination propofol . Drawbacks use ketamine sole induction agent relate hemodynamic psychotomimetic effect ( e.g . post-treatment hypertension hallucinogenic activity ) . New literature postulate putative anti-depressant effect ketamine via N-Methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor , ECT set specifically may helpful regard overall goal therapy ( i.e . ECT indicate severe treatment-resistant depression ) . Current research focus efficacy ketamine respect anti-depressant effect suggest ketamine may even represent alternative ECT . As per investigator ' standard practice ECT , treatment patient would 3 time per week total 12 treatment ( i.e . 4 week treatment ) . The total study duration patient 6 week . As discussed , patient withdraw study anytime upon request treat psychiatrist feel clinical improvement strong enough justify . An interim analysis complete first 14 patient complete treatment . If first 14 patient investigator find low expect difference efficacy favor ketamine group , able achieve alpha error &gt; 0.2 power &lt; 80 % , subsequently recruit patient randomize receive either propofol usual induction dos ECT ( 0.75 - 1 mg/kg IV bolus ) placebo ( normal saline ) , slightly high dose ketamine 0.5 mg/kg . Should turn case , thirty new patient recruit point .</detailed_description>
