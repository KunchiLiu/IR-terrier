	<brief_summary>In almost one third patient rectal cancer , cancer spread bowel wall nearby vein see MRI scan know mrEMVI . It observe linked bad survival due spread cancer liver organ . The investigator think may occur spread cancer cell blood stream . Circulating cell-free tumour DNA ( ctDNA ) detect blood patient metastatic primary carcinoma ( healthy individual ) . This trial interfere patient 's routine treatment pathway . Participants choose demonstrate mrEMVI baseline MRI scan . 20 patient become mrEMVI positive ( follow pre-operative therapy ) 20 patient mrEMVI negative blood sample take surgery comparison make two group . If investigator find link cancer cell see blood mrEMVI may able use test help guide treatment future . This study serve feasibility large , comparative study .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Circulating Tumour DNA ( ctDNA ) Rectal Cancer Relationship Extramural Venous Invasion</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Vascular venous invasion patient rectal cancer consider significant prognostic factor half century . Interest understand mechanism govern tumour spread rectum distant sit liver drive study lymphatic vascular invasion malignant cell . Venous invasion traditionally identify histological analysis resection specimens remain variability pathologist . Inconsistencies histological method use identify venous vascular invasion lead difficulty interpret actual incidence prevalence ; literature report prevalence range 9-61 % . None-the-less EMVI consider independent prognostic factor recognise Royal College Pathologists UK include minimum dataset reporting colorectal cancer . More recently , increase accuracy high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) mean prognostic factor extra mural venous invasion confidently identify imaging . The literature show EMVI well identify use MRI . mrEMVI also show independent prognostic factor disease recurrence follow chemoradiotherapy . Furthermore MRI identify additional case EMVI compare routine histopathology degree improvement mrEMVI post-CRT scan associate improved disease-free survival . Circulating cell-free tumour DNA ( ctDNA ) detect blood patient metastatic primary carcinoma . By virtue presence EMVI , likely tumour cell DNA fragment likely shed , high blood circulate % mutation frequency see compare patient mrEMVI negative . These tumour fragment may act microemboli site potentially increase risk develop metastasis . Furthermore intra-operative manipulation tumour may lead great release tumour cell mesenteric circulation suggest wedge shape defect liver surgical resection due portal vein thrombus . There several way identify cell free tumour DNA . Studies use polymerase chain reaction ( PCR- way concentrate amount ctDNA become meaningful measurable amount use assess aberration ) also show ctDNA associate increase risk disease recurrence bad survival outcome . There standard technique confound factor present step analysis ctDNA , lead sample error inconsistency . This lead development several technique try increase isolation DNA fast spin columns ctDNA bind silica gel elute use water buffer system . Polymerase chain reaction use quantify tumour ctDNA . Other technique include double spin use phenol-chloroform , amplification method rapid spin retrieve small DNA fragment . Early study measure quantified total amount circulate DNA find high amount overall cell free DNA associate tumour . ctDNA tumour cell distinguish normal ctDNA examine profile relation size fragmentation however debate arise whether long shorter fragment associate tumour result unclear conclusion . Circulating tumour DNA hypothesize arise tumour , normal tissue tumour-associated stromal cell , however , tumour derive ctDNA tend fragmented exhibit great variation size although overall large ctDNA arise normal tissue . Investigation whether spike intra-operative phase would interest . A study show recurrent disease relate ctDNA increase higher patient metastatic disease furthermore patient higher ctDNA level metastases poor prognosis . The challenge type analysis cell-free DNA may may directly relate tumour recently focus turn tumour specific cell free tumour DNA define known mutation kras p53 ( tumour p53 term tp53 ) . In colorectal cancer majority patient non-hypermutated tumour histology . Of hyper-mutated tumour TP53 KRAS make 60 % 43 % mutation respectively . The investigator screen blood-based ctDNA p53 KRAS . When investigator take blood get certain amount circulate DNA could tumour normal analyse see mutation investigator call ctDNA ( circulate tumour DNA ) . If mutation necessarily exclude ctDNA sensitivity specificity associate analysis method mutation ( i.e KRAS tp53 ) tumours KRAS p53 mutation . In report colorectal cancer pick-up rate mutation blood correlate 100 % tumour find mutation histology . Furthermore plasma serum sampling may sensitive cohort 100 patient pick-up rate tumour may 70 % one mutation ( kras TP53 ) . In cancer lung cancer , investigator pick 65 % mutation blood , therefore average investigator expect detect 0.65 x 60 = 39 % patient detectable mutation blood . For study likely pick-up rate lie 39 - 70 % . In group , investigator able compare ctDNA profile EMVI positive negative tumour neoadjuvant long course chemoradiotherapy determine ctDNA profile change intraoperatively .</detailed_description>
