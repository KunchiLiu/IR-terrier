	<brief_summary>Despite conscious intention remain abstinent , person substance use disorder often find negative emotion environmental cue automatically `` trigger '' drink substance use . This study aim test whether activate baroreflex mechanism use `` moment '' help resist drink trigger . It consist 3 phase ( Recruitment , Intervention , Follow-up ) . Stage 1 : Trained research staff conduct comprehensive clinical interview questionnaire assess participant 's mood , substance use , trigger . Participants pair Primary Research Clinician ( PRC ) work intervention . Stage 2 : Approximately 4 week intake Center Great Expectations Intensive Outpatient program , 8-week intervention begin . Pre-and post-intervention laboratory session occur Cardiac Neuroscience Laboratory , Center Alcohol Studies , Piscataway , NJ . Some participant take part pre- post-intervention neuroimaging session ( Rutgers University Brain Imaging Center , Newark , NJ ) . Participants randomize active intervention control group pre-intervention lab session . They give iPhone train use pace breathe app pre-loaded onto phone . Participants group use app time anticipate experience trigger drink use drug . Participants compensate use app time participation . To ensure participant correctly perform pace breathe task , PRC visit weekly provide coaching session use computer-based biofeedback program . During 4th week , ECG respiration data collect . Participants also complete questionnaire mood trigger , provide feedback usefulness app . During lab session , participant complete series questionnaire ECG , blood pressure respiration collect four 5-minute task ( rest baseline , non-resonance breathing , resonance breathing , visual processing/attention ) . During neuroimaging session , participant place scanner structural scan four 5-minute task ( task previously note ) ; ECG blood pressure record . Stage 3 : Participants re-contacted 1 3 month intervention complete questionnaire quality life across multiple domain usefulness app .</brief_summary>
