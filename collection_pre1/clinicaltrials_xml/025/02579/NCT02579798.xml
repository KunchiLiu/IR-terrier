	<detailed_description>General anesthesia , even patient good health , impair gas exchange ventilatory mechanic . These effect result primarily atelectasis formation . They occur 85-90 % healthy patient minute follow induction positive end expiratory pressure ( PEEP ) use . These atelectasis form one hand reduction functional residual capacity ( FRC ) follow compression mechanism ( loss inspiratory muscle tone , accompany chest wall configuration change diaphragm cephalic movement ) hand denitrogenation absorption process ( ventilation high Fi02 ( oxygen inspire fraction ) cause complete absorption O2 lack support alveolus , collapse ) . The FRC obese patient general anesthesia even small one healthy patient . There direct relationship body mass index decrease functional residual capacity . Obese patient therefore atelectasis . The increased abdominal pressure pneumoperitoneum increase decrease CRF , thus aggravate formation atelectasis . Atelectasis affect peroperative gas exchange likely involved worsen postoperative hypoxemia episode . In addition , atelectasis alter clearance secretion lymph flow , predispose lung infections.Taking factor account , logical think atelectasis presence lead increase postsurgical morbidity ( respiratory distress , infection ) . That actively fight formation atelectasis important . Several strategy study order improve respiratory mechanic reduce impair gas exchange laparoscopic surgery obese patient . The position call `` chair '' , mechanical ventilation PEEP , recruitment maneuver follow PEEP , spontaneous ventilation CPAP extubation , strategy prove effective decrease development atelectasis . Currently , scientific community agree fact PEEP improve intraoperative respiratory function ( improve compliance , oxygenation ) especially conjunction recruitment maneuver . But lack scientific evidence say strategy atelectasis PEEP significant impact patient 's postoperative status . The expected clinical benefit balance ( reduction respiratory distress episode , infection mortality ) versus risk link maneuver do reduce development atelectasis ( barotraumas , cardiac complication ) remain determined . The primary goal study evaluate impact two different alveolar recruitment strategy incidence postoperative hypoxemia obese patient bariatric surgery . The secondary objective study compare number recruitment maneuver , Pa02 / FI02 ratio , dynamic compliance , anatomic dead space intraoperative PaCO2-EtCO2 gradient two alveolar recruitment strategy apply obese patient laparoscopic bariatric surgery ( gastric bypass sleeve gastrectomy ) .
