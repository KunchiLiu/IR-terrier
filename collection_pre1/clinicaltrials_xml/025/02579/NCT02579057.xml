	<brief_summary>This study evaluate clinical efficacy subcutaneously administer Furosemide Injection Solution versus intravenous administration Furosemide Injection , United States Pharmacopeia ( USP ) adult patient present heart failure clinic decompensated heart failure . Half patient receive subcutaneously administer Furosemide Injection Solution ; half receive intravenous administration Furosemide Injection .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sub-Q Versus IV Furosemide Acute Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prevalence chronic heart failure increase , despite advance treatment chronic heart failure , in-hospital mortality readmission high . Heart failure cost US 32 billion per year , large percentage cost due hospitalization . Most clinician would agree patient decompensated heart failure present hypotension , worsen renal function alter mental status hospitalize . However , subset patient present dyspnea edema due volume overload necessitate rapid symptom improvement hemodynamically stable . Oral diuretic would likely ineffective hospital admission IV diuretic seem excessive . The research hypothesis subcutaneously administer furosemide effective alternative IV furosemide hemodynamically stable chronic heart failure patient present volume overload ambulatory set . Patients randomize receive Furosemide Injection , USP intravenously Furosemide Injection Solution ( SCP-101 ) deliver subcutaneously . The IV patient get usual care heart failure clinic , include IV place delivery one-time dose IV furosemide dose determine provider ( maximum dose 160mg IV ) . The subcutaneous patient receive 80mg Furosemide Injection Solution ( SCP-101 ) administer subcutaneously 5 hour ( 30mg first hour 12.5mg/hour 4 hour ) . Both group patient observe 6 hour assess diuresis . Patients ask fill survey symptom improvement ( Kansas City Cardiomyopathy questionnaire ) overall satisfaction relate treatment experience . They also monitor side effect include ototoxicity discomfort access site ( burn , itch , pain ) . Electrolytes renal function check patient receive diuretic therapy .</detailed_description>
