	<brief_title>Axitinib Given Individualized Schedule Metastatic Renal Cell Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective To determine whether axitinib give individualized dose/schedule metastatic renal cell carcinoma follow immunotherapy PD-1 PD-L1 Inhibitors lead improved PFS . Secondary objective : 1 . To characterize objective response rate patient give axitinib individualized dose/schedule . 2 . To evaluate tolerability safety alternative method axitinib titration . 3 . To characterize anti-tumor effect , measure change tumor burden per RECIST 1.1 , axitinib titration perform initial RECIST PD axitinib .</detailed_description>
