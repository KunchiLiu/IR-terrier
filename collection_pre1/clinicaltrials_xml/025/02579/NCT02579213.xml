	<brief_title>Electronic Nose Fetal Chromosomal Disorders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The biochemical engineering department develop device call `` electronic nose '' detect various disease Including cancer asthma basis evaporable substance . The device simulate human nose `` , include array tiny sensor connect nanometric size electronic calculate unit.. Thanks small size , electrical , physical chemical property , sensitive sensor smell identify change composition material characterize various disease include kidney disease asthma . The electronic nose develop Professor Haick Technion . The main concept device test characterization trace amount substances air help nana-technology sensor idea revolutionary would allow diagnosis different disease , like cancer , exhale air device . The test simple complicate perform , examiner inhale air bag connect `` electronic nose '' . The molecule patient 's breath tie sensor transmit electrical signal computer chip . After process data `` electronic nose `` distinguish normal cell pathological cell . Hypothesis : tiny sensor ( `` electronic nose '' ) smell detect change sample abnormal fetal karyotype , fluid confirm amniocentesis .</detailed_description>
