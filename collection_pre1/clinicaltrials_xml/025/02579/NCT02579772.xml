	<brief_title>Effects N-acetylcysteine Cardiorespiratory Control COPD Patients With Mild-to-moderate Airflow Obstruction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) lead cause morbidity mortality worldwide . Cardiovascular complication constitute main cause poor physical capacity healthcare resource utilization COPD . There emerge evidence impairment major impact health patient mild-to-moderate disease , large sub-population COPD . This important problem , however , currently neglect specific pharmacological treatment offer patient . Recent study indicate vascular abnormality mediate , least part , circulate inflammatory substance direct damage artery oxygen radical ( oxidative stress ) . The current investigation test hypothesis N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) , via anti-inflammatory antioxidant property , improve systemic vascular function physical capacity COPD patient mild-to-moderate airflow obstruction .</detailed_description>
