	<brief_summary>The NIA algorithm similar traditional 12-lead ECG equipment . By analyze patient data , NIA algorithm provide detailed result compare traditional 12-lead ECG . Patients suspect coronary artery disease conventionally diagnose treated cardiac catheterization . However , cardiac catheterization invasive procedure . Unless clinical diagnosis evident cardiac catheterization , treadmill exercise test , nuclear medicine myocardial perfusion test , multi-direction coronary CT angiogram usually perform increase accuracy diagnosis . But examination accessible patient , time-consuming costly .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In project , investigator hope compare data collect new technology NIA algorithm result final diagnosis cardiac catheterization . As NIA algorithm fast less costly , provide sensitivity specificity exercise ECG , nuclear myocardial perfusion test , high-resolution coronary CT angiogram , expedite diagnosis patient coronary artery disease .</detailed_description>
