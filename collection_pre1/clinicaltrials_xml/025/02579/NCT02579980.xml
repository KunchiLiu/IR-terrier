	<brief_summary>Unless cancer quickly get small radiation chemotherapy , investigator tell treatment work . In research program , two technique use magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan test people sarcomas , rare cancer start muscle , tendon , bone . These particular MRI test call dynamic contrast enhance MRI diffusion weight MRI . These MRI scan allow visualization sarcoma different normal organ body . These MRI test tell u location sarcoma proximity structure , well correlation image pathological characteristic surgery</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI ( DCE-MRI ) Diffusion Weighted MRI ( DW-MRI ) image approach utilized preclinical evaluation well clinical trial . DW-MRI technique quantify increase water diffusion cause cellular necrosis apoptosis tumor within day therapy . DCE-MRI frequently use preclinical early clinical trial assessment anti-angiogenic vascular disrupting compound , also within hour therapeutic intervention . Evidence drug efficacy dose-dependent response demonstrate certain angiogenesis inhibitor . It may also provide useful information identify early disease progression , independent treatment modality . While approach provide additional functional information , yet validate sarcoma patient . This study seek develop standardized protocol perform DCE-MRI DW-MRI implement clinical trial patient sarcomas surgical resection part standard care . This allow accuracy vivo MRI measurement directly compare histology ground truth . The study also determine reproducibility technique use repeat baseline image well evaluate quantitative change parameter therapy correlate histopathology . The collaboration Columbia University University Utah project allow exist quantitative MRI approach expand multi-center setting , establish paradigm infrastructure future expansion large scale multi-center therapeutic trial sarcoma .</detailed_description>
