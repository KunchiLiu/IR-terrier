	<brief_title>A Comparison Ultrathin Strut Biodegradable Polymer Sirolimus-Eluting Stent With Durable Polymer Everolimus-Eluting Stent Patients With Acute ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction Undergoing Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background Primary percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) consider nowadays reperfusion strategy choice patient acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction ( STEMI , owe low risk myocardial re-infarction improve short- long-term survival compare fibrinolysis . However , STEMI still associate poor clinical outcome PCI , compare stable CAD , high rate stent thrombosis increase risk myocardial re-infarction persist throughout long-term follow-up . recent data randomize controlled trial meta-analyses demonstrate consistent strong signal towards significant reduction major adverse cardiac event among patient STEMI undergo primary PCI third-generation DESs , compare first-generation second-generation DESs durable polymer . Importantly , signal suggest superiority third-generation DESs patient STEMI never demonstrate second-generation DESs . Third-generation DESs enhance biocompatibility may therefore particular clinical benefit high-risk subgroup patient delay vascular healing data warrant confirmation appropriately design randomize control trial . Objective The purpose study compare safety efficacy novel biodegradable-polymer sirolimus-eluting stent ( Orsiro® ) durable-polymer everolimus-eluting stent ( Xience Xpedition Xience Alpine® ) superiority trial among patient present acute STEMI undergo primary PCI . Methods Eligible patient acute STEMI presenting within 24 hour symptom onset undergo primary PCI . At PCI , randomly allocate stent implant culprit lesion target vessel . Patients followed-up hospital visit 12 month . Patients followed-up clinical endpoint telephone 30 day 2 year .</detailed_description>
