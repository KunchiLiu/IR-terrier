	<brief_title>Inspiratory Muscle Training Breathless Patients With Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) heart failure reduce leave ventricular ejection fraction ( HF ) lead cause disability death worldwide . Unfortunately , COPD HF coexist third elderly patient make so-called COPD-HF overlap ( CHO ) major challenge Health Care Systems . In addition , population age anticipates CHO prevalence increase next decade . Intolerance exertion due disable breathlessness hallmark COPD HF abnormalities notoriously potentiate disease coexistence . The inspiratory muscle centrally related pathophysiology exertional dyspnea COPD HF . In population higher central motor command output require maintain adequate force generation face weak inspiratory muscle . This information interpret `` shortness breath '' . There well establish evidence gain recent meta-analyses indicate inspiratory muscle training ( IMT ) , standalone therapy , significantly improve inspiratory muscle function ( strength endurance ) , dyspnea daily activity , functional exercise capacity COPD HF . Previous finding indicate reduce pressure-generating capacity reflect inspiratory muscle weakness frequently observe patient COPD-HF related clinically-relevant outcome : exertional dyspnea . These finding set scene randomize control trial investigate potential role IMT dyspnea palliation CHO patient . Objectives To determine effect IMT : 1 . Dyspnea daily life 2 . Inspiratory muscle strength endurance 3 . Dyspnea exertion time exercise intolerance</detailed_description>
