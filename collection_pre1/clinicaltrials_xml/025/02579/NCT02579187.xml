	<brief_title>MicroRNA MicroRNA Inhibitors Socket Study , Pilot Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate efficacy locally deliver plasmid DNAs encode microRNAS and/or microRNA inhibitor , naturally occur microRNA molecule , promotion bone formation attenuation local inflammation tooth socket model human . Patients require tooth extraction future tooth replacement therapy dental implant eligible study . Recruited subject randomly assign either control ( tooth extraction 10µg empty vector bovine collagen sponge ) one 3 experimental group : - Experimental group 1 : Tooth extraction bovine collagen sponge contain 10µg pSil-miR200c - Experimental Group 2 : Tooth extraction bovine Collagen sponge contain 10µg PMIS miR200a - Experimental Group 3 : Tooth extraction bovine Collagen sponge contain 5µg pSil-miR200c 5µg PMIS miR200a Subjects clinically re-evaluated 1 , 2 , 3 4 week . In one visit , fluid sample obtain heal site minimally invasive manner assess local biomolecular profile . Blood sample draw 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 14 week visit assess miR-200c PMIS-miR 200a expression liver function . Photos and/or video also obtain . A CBCT scan saliva sample ( approx . 2 ml ) also obtain baseline 14 week assess bone volume intraoral biomolecular profile , respectively . Implant placement surgery perform 16 week time tooth extraction . A bone core biopsy harvest time histologic analysis . A periapical radiograph ( small dental x-ray image ) obtain baseline ( tooth extraction ) 14 week ( prior implant placement ) ass bone height change . Follow-up visit occur 6 month 12 month post implant time measurement photos take .</detailed_description>
