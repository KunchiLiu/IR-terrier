	<brief_title>24 Months Safety Efficacy Study AADvac1 Patients With Mild Alzheimer 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder brain . Over course disease , pathological protein accumulate brain , damaging neuron , thus cause lose connection die . Currently available treatment design compensate neurotransmitter loss cause disease without affect disease process . AADvac1 design raise antibody pathological tau protein ( primary constituent neurofibrillary pathology AD ) . These antibody expect prevent tau protein aggregating , facilitate removal tau protein aggregate prevent spread pathology , slow halt progress disease .</detailed_description>
