	<brief_summary>The aim multicenter triple-arm randomize study compare two innovative technique gold standard currently use provide unsatisfactory result In-Stent Restenosis ( ISR ) treatment femoro-popliteal artery . This protocol compare use drug-coated balloon ( paclitaxel - antimitotic ) use alone association Excimer Laser recalibrate vessel lumen stent destroy whole fibrous material standard angioplasty use plain balloon . INTACT study main objective ass cost-effectiveness ratio treatment femoropopliteal artery in-stent restenosis compare two innovative strategy standard one term cost per Qaly ( Quality adjust life-years ) gain 18 month collective perspective .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparison Angioplasty/Drug Coated Balloon/Laser + Drug Coated Balloon Femoropopliteal Artery In-stent Restenosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The publication show probably effectiveness gradient ( express proportion patient in-stent restenosis 18 month intervention first stenosis reduction ) : standard balloon would less effective active balloon less effective combination excimer laser . Reducing risk In-Stent Restenosis major implication treatment patient reduces use arterial bypass amputation , unable perform revascularization . Based promising result efficiency , hypothesize active balloon combination Excimer laser would improve quality life patient reduce cost treatment , compare asset balloon . This improvement quality life reduce cost care would observe asset compare standard balloon . In health economic term , therefore likely strategy combine asset balloon Excimer laser dominant asset balloon dominant standard balloon .</detailed_description>
