	<brief_summary>Upper limb neural mechanosensitivity painful disturbance breast cancer patient often undergo follow axillary surgery . It assess upper limb neurodynamic test median nerve , call upper limb neurodynamic test 1 ( ULNT1 ) . Design : A matched case-control observational study . Objective : check increase upper limb mechanosensitivity shoulder range motion ( ROM ) ULNT1 determine , first time , evoke electromyographic ( EMG ) muscle activity . Participants : 62 case underwent breast cancer surgery 64 match control woman . Setting : Torrejon Hospital , Physical Therapy Department , Madrid ( Spain ) . Intervention : To record EMG muscle activity ULNT1 performance measure shoulder ROM . Key outcome : mechanosensitivity , breast cancer , pain , EMG , shoulder ROM , median nerve .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Upper limb neural mechanosensitivity painful disturbance breast cancer patient often undergo follow axillary surgery . It assess upper limb neurodynamic test median nerve , call upper limb neurodynamic test 1 ( ULNT1 ) .A neural provocation test sequence movement design ass mechanic physiology part nervous system elongate length nerve bed increase pressure around peripheral nerve .The reliable test ass upper limb neural mechanosensitivity neural provocation test median nerve , call upper limb neurodynamic test 1 ( ULNT1 ) . This test consist depress shoulder girdle neutral position , shoulder abduction lateral rotation , elbow extension , forearm supination wrist extension . Cervical contralateral lateral flexion may include increase load brachial plexus , sensitize maneuver , differentiate structurally neural non-neural involvement . The ULNT1 consider positive symptom reproduce affected upper limb , side-to-side difference ROM , symptom modify lateral neck side-bending . Likewise , It also necessary ass EMG activity involve muscle verify early increase protective muscle response suggest throughout neural strain performance .
