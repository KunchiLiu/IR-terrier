	<brief_title>Clinical Outcomes Cost Gram Negative Bacteremia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 : Define clinical impact gram negative bacterial ( GNB ) bloodstream infection ( BSI ) . In objective , investigator describe prevalence , source bacteremia , location acquisition ( i.e. , community-acquired , healthcare-associated , hospital-acquired ) GNB BSI . The investigator also examine outcomes associate GNB BSI include length hospital stay , length ICU stay , in-house mortality , hospital cost . Specific Aim 2 : Describe antibiotic resistance pattern GNB BSI , explore association antibiotic resistance clinical economic outcome . In objective , investigator describe prevalence antibiotic susceptibility profile multidrug resistant phenotype include MDR bacteria , define resistance three drug class , ESBL-producers , CRE . The investigator examine difference mortality , resource use ( length hospital stay , length ICU stay ) , direct medical cost case without antibiotic resistance .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Since January 2002 , one investigator ( VGF ) receive daily report clinical microbiology laboratory hospitalize patient Duke University Medical Center one blood culture ( ) positive gram negative rod . Patients evaluate within 36 hour detection bacteremia clinical evidence infection Patients exclude study follow reason : age le 18 year , polymicrobial infection ( blood culture positive one pathogen ) , neutropenia ( white blood cell count le 1.0 x 109/L ) , death prior return positive blood culture . In order preserve independence observation , initial episode gram negative bacteremia include analysis ( e.g. , patient include ) . The study approve Duke University Medical Center Institutional Review Board .</criteria>
