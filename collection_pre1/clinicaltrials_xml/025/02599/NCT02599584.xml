	<detailed_description>High fidelity simulate environment allow safe learn critical event knowledge appropriate response treatment . Anesthesiology resident education curriculum Lyon plan several high fidelity simulation session large panel critical event . Anticipation critical event may occur , plannification team resource , priority treatment strategy effective communication within team , may help improve team performance scenario . The investigator ' goal compare team performance scenario without preparation team staff 4 min . This staff suggest brief scenario scenario start . The investigator go compare group anesthesiology resident go scenario simulate critical event high fidelity simulation session . Scenarios record analyzed 2 reviewer independantly . A checklist appropriate treatment non technical skill checklist use cote team performance . Stress participant assess visual analogic scale participant anxiety stress . two group ( preparation staff preparation staff ) compare see improvement team performance associate intervention .</detailed_description>
