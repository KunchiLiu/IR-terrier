	<brief_title>Local Inflammation Does Not Correlate With Bacterial Colonization Contamination Perineural Catheters</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Two hundred orthopedic patient plan receive PNC prospectively randomize group PNC-removal alcoholic skin disinfection group PNC-removal without skin disinfection . After standardized PNC-placement sterile condition , patient receive perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis clinical sign local inflammation infection periodically record : The PNC observe twice daily clinical sign local inflammation local infection . Patients also evaluate clinical sign systemic infection . The adhesive dressing change become dislodged blood secretion make visualization puncture site impossible . For dress change , anaesthesiologist wear facemask , cap sterile glove . Postoperatively , 6 hour initial bolus , local anaesthetic infusion line connect micro filter PNC . All patient receive patient-controlled perineural analgesia ( basal rate 5 ml/h , bolus 4 ml , lock-out time 20 min ) ropivacaine 0.3 % 24 hour , reduce ropivacaine 0.2 % . PNC remove sterile condition 72h early case sign infection : Removal PNC perform surgical ward anaesthesiologist accord standardized procedure : Wearing facemask cap , adhesive skin dress remove . In `` WITH-group '' , skin disinfect aerosolized alcoholic solution ( propanol-biphenol ) . Procedure continue three minute , skin dry anaesthesiologist wear sterile glove use sterile tweezer . The distal part PNC ( direct tip PNC ) withdraw 1 cm insertion site cut distally tweezer sterile pair scissors . The distal part PNC totally withdraw sterile tweezer , sterile pair scissors cut two part : tip ( define distal 2 cm ) subcutaneous part , place separate dry sterile container . Finally , remain proximal part PNC throw away . The sterile container contain PNC store 4Â°C sent laboratory day microbiological analysis PNC : The PNC roll onto sheep blood agar plate ( Becton Dickinson BD , Basel , Switzerland ) similar semiquantitative culture method intravenous catheter [ 10 ] thereafter immediately transfer liquid enrichment medium ( thioglycolate medium , BD Basel Switzerland ) . Sheep blood agar incubate 2 day thioglycolate 5 day . In case growth enrichment medium , aliquot liquid subcultured solid medium . Reports consider positive growth present . Identification isolate bacteria susceptibility test perform accord standard method . All patient observe clinical sign local infection PNC insertion site clinical sign systemic infection one week PNC-removal . For correlation detection bacteria PNC clinical sign in-flammation , sensitivity , specificity , positive negative predictive value calculate basis follow three category : 1 ) growth bacteria include enrichment , 2 ) equal 5 colony 3 ) equal 15 colony semiquantative culture technique , respectively .</detailed_description>
