	<brief_summary>Background : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) fourth lead cause chronic morbidity mortality worldwide . There debate diagnosis management COPD describe complex syndrome accounting various pulmonary extrapulmonary abnormality . As result , consensus clinical evaluation pulmonary function test ( PFTs ) data adequately describe complexity disease . The chest radiograph sole image examination recommend routine evaluation patient physicians guideline ( GOLD guideline ) , , however , also debate utility compute tomography ( CT ) set . Indeed , number study report dramatic increasing use CT chest COPD assessment , clinical research setting . COPD assessment CT seem improve accuracy completeness clinical evaluation patient . Nevertheless , clinical utility CT yet prove prospective study define guideline . Objectives : To evaluate change diagnosis management COPD multiple CT-derived information add pre-test evaluation . Methods : Four pulmonologists various expertise field review clinical data , PFTs result , chest radiograph 200 consecutive COPD patient diagnose accord current guideline . Therefore , two month first evaluation , pulmonologists review clinical PFTs record comprehensive information low-dose CT ( LDCT ) previously perform week chest radiograph . Information LDCT finding include qualitative assessment experience chest radiologist quantitative analysis mean innovative 3D imaging dedicate software . Phenotype assessment patient care decision ( e.g . therapeutic follow-up strategy , need additional test etc . ) record assimilation LDCT data . Expected result : This evidence-based prospective study test impact chest LDCT management COPD patient . In addition , level agreement pulmonologists term diagnosis therapeutic strategy assess . Furthermore , study evaluate need additional test referable LDCT information impact health care system ( e.g . term additional cost ) .</brief_summary>
