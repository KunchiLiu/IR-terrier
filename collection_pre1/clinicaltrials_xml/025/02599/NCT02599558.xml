	<brief_title>Cytosponge Dietary Therapy EoE</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dietary Therapy show successful treatment adult pediatric patient eosinophilic esophagitis Dietary study initially report child , result appear similar adult patient . Elemental diet successful 70-95 % patient poorly tolerate . A six food elimination diet effective 70 % adult patient EoE . In adult study skin prick test helpful predict food would lead flare disease reintroduce diet . Therefore , current standard care require multiple EGDs esophageal biopsy dietary restriction reintroduction phase study . Since investigator make lifelong dietary decision process food reintroduction , imperative investigator accurate . Unfortunately , multiple EGDs significant cost invasive procedure risk . Moreover , significant indirect cost travel time work patient driver . Previous study find esophageal sponge accurate technique access esophageal eosinophilia EoE . The sponge swallow 12 mm capsule string . The capsule rapidly dissolve upon enter stomach sponge expand pulled mouth five minute ingestion . In previous study , procedure well tolerated patient preferred sponge endoscopy . Therefore sponge well tolerate , inexpensive , low risk procedure would ideal option replace EGD esophageal sample evaluation dietary treatment EoE .</detailed_description>
