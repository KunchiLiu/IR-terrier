	<criteria>Patient must histologically cytologically confirm breast cancer metastatic ; ER , PR HER2 status allow . Biopsy confirm metastatic breast cancer Retinoblastoma protein ( Rb ) positivity immunohistochemistry prior enrol protocol require . Biopsy must obtain immediately study enrollment ; intervene treatment allow . Patient must measurable disease define RECIST 1.1 criterion . Age ≥18 year Patient must receive ≤3 prior cytotoxic regimen metastatic setting . Performance status 01 ECOG Performance Scale . The subject must adequate organ function , define follow Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min In absence liver metastasis , alanine aminotransferase ( AST ) aspartate aminotransferase ( ALT ) &lt; 2.5 x ULN . If patient liver metastasis , ALT AST &lt; 5 x ULN . Total bilirubin &lt; ULN ; total bilirubin ≤ 3.0 x ULN direct bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN patient well document Gilbert 's Syndrome . For subject without extensive bone metastasis : alkaline phosphatase level &lt; 2.5 x ULN Potassium , total calcium ( correct serum albumin ) , magnesium , sodium phosphorus within normal limit institution correct within normal limit supplement first dose study medication INR ≤ 1.5 unless warfarin case INR &lt; 3.0 acceptable . The subject must adequate marrow function , define follow Leukocytes Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1500/mm3 Platelets ≥100,000/mm3 , Hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL The subject must able swallow ribociclib ( LEE011 ) Exclusion Criteria Patient currently participate participate study investigational compound device within 30 day Study Day 1 within 5 halflives investigational product , whichever longer , exception prior CDK 4/6 inhibitor . Patient prior toxicity CDK 4/6 inhibitor necessitating discontinuation drug . Patient may prior treatment cdk 4/6 inhibitor adjuvant metastatic setting . Patient chemotherapy exposure CDK 4/6 inhibitor within 3 week ( 6 week nitrosoureas , mitomycin C bevacizumab ) recover adverse event due previous agent administer 4 week prior Study Day 1 . Hormonal therapy must discontinue least 24 hour prior start study treatment . Patient unable biopsy metastatic site Rb testing , biopsy felt invasive risky treating physician . Patient receive available therapy confer clinical benefit . Patient know active CNS metastasis and/or carcinomatous meningitis . However , patient CNS metastasis ( include brain metastasis ) eligible study provide clinically stable meet ALL follow criterion : At least 4 week prior therapy completion ( include radiation and/or surgery ) start study treatment Clinically stable CNS tumor time screen receive steroid and/or enzymeinducing antiepileptic medication brain metastasis . Patient known hypersensitivity excipients ribociclib The subject uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited : Ongoing active infection Diabetes mellitus Symptomatic congestive heart failure ( see 5.2.14 ) , unstable angina pectoris , stroke myocardial infarction within 12 month screen Patient baseline neuropathy ≥ grade 2 . Patients know allergic reaction paclitaxel IV contrast dye despite standard prophylaxis . The subject know positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Note : baseline HIV screening require The subject unable unwilling abide study protocol cooperate fully investigator designee . Patient concurrent malignancy malignancy within 3 year prior start study drug , exception adequately treat , basal squamous cell carcinoma , nonmelanomatous skin cancer curatively resect cervical cancer . Patient able swallow oral medication and/or impairment gastrointestinal ( GI ) function GI disease may significantly alter absorption study drug ( e.g. , ulcerative disease , uncontrolled nausea , vomit , diarrhea , malabsorption syndrome , small bowel resection ) . Patient concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled medical condition would , investigator 's judgment , cause unacceptable safety risk , contraindicate patient participation clinical study compromise compliance protocol ( e.g . chronic pancreatitis , chronic active hepatitis , active untreated uncontrolled fungal , bacterial viral infection , etc. ) . Patient active cardiac disease history cardiac dysfunction include follow : History acute coronary syndrome ( include myocardial infarction , unstable angina , coronary artery bypass grafting , coronary angioplasty , stenting ) symptomatic pericarditis within 12 month prior screen History document congestive heart failure ( New York Heart Association functional classification IIIIV ) Documented cardiomyopathy Patient Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ( LVEF ) &lt; 50 % determined Multiple Gated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan echocardiogram ( ECHO ) screen History ventricular , supraventricular , nodal arrhythmia , cardiac arrhythmia , long QT Syndrome conduction abnormality within 12 month screen Congenital long QT syndrome family history long QT syndrome Bradycardia ( heart rate &lt; 50 rest ) , ECG pulse , screen Systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) &gt; 160 mmHg &lt; 90 mmHg screen On screening , inability determine QTcF interval ECG ( i.e . : unreadable interpretable ) QTcF &gt; 450 msec ( use Fridericia 's correction ) . All determine screen ECG ( mean triplicate ECGs ) Patient currently receive follow medication discontinue 7 day prior start study drug ( see Table 6.2 detail ) : Known strong inducer inhibitor CYP3A4/5 , include grapefruit , grapefruit hybrid , pummelo , starfruit , Seville oranges That narrow therapeutic window predominantly metabolize CYP3A4/5 That know risk prolong QT interval induce Torsades de Pointes Patient currently receive receive systemic corticosteroid ≤ 2 week prior start study drug , fully recover side effect treatment . The following us corticosteroid permit : single dos , topical application ( e.g. , rash ) , inhale spray ( e.g. , obstructive airway disease ) , eye drop local injection ( e.g. , intraarticular ) . Patient currently receive warfarin coumarinderived anticoagulant treatment , prophylaxis otherwise . Therapy heparin , low molecular weight heparin ( LMWH ) fondaparinux allow . Participation prior investigational therapeutic study within 30 day prior enrollment within 5 halflives investigational product , whichever longer . Patient receive radiotherapy ≤ 4 week limited field radiation palliation ≤ 2 week prior start study drug , recover grade 1 well related side effect therapy ( exception include alopecia ) and/or ≥ 25 % bone marrow irradiate . Patient major surgery within 14 day prior start study drug recover major side effect ( surgical wound must fully heal ) . For purpose criterion , major surgical procedure define one require administration general anesthesia ( tumor biopsy consider major surgery ) . Patient recover toxicity relate prior anticancer therapy NCICTCAE version 4.03 Grade &lt; 1 ( Exception criterion : patient degree alopecia allow enter study ) . Patient ChildPugh score B C Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman , pregnancy define state female conception termination gestation , confirm positive hCG laboratory test . Women childbearing potential , defined woman physiologically capable become pregnant , unless use highly effective method contraception throughout study 8 week study drug discontinuation . Highly effective contraception method include : Total abstinence line prefer usual lifestyle patient . Periodic abstinence ( e.g. , calendar , ovulation , symptothermal , postovulation method ) withdrawal acceptable method contraception Female sterilization ( surgical bilateral oophorectomy without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week take study treatment . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment Combination two follow ( a+b a+c b+c ) Use oral , injected implant hormonal method contraception form hormonal contraception comparable efficacy ( failure rate &lt; 1 % ) , example hormone vaginal ring transdermal hormone contraception Placement intrauterine device ( IUD ) intrauterine system ( IUS ) Barrier method contraception : Condom Occlusive cap ( diaphragm cervical/vault cap ) spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ vaginal suppository In case use oral contraception , woman stable pill take study treatment . Note : Oral contraceptive allow used conjunction barrier method contraception due unknown effect drugdrug interaction . Women consider postmenopausal child bear potential 12 month natural ( spontaneous ) amenorrhea appropriate clinical profile ( e.g . age appropriate , history vasomotor symptom ) surgical bilateral oophorectomy ( without hysterectomy ) tubal ligation least six week ago . In case oophorectomy alone , reproductive status woman confirm follow hormone level assessment consider child bear potential .</criteria>
