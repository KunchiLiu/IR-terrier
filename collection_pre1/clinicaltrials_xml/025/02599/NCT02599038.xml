	<brief_title>Serine Supplementation Obese Subjects With Fatty Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There strong correlation major adverse health consequence obesity development non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . NAFLD characterize abnormal hepatic accumulation triglyceride lipid . It become worldwide health problem accelerate cirrhosis , type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) , especially premature cardiovascular morbidity mortality . The plasma level glutathione ( GSH ) typically deplete individual metabolism relate disorder . However , cellular GSH level increase supplement GSH must synthesize within liver either de novo salvation pathway . The investigator find level GSH enough maintain regulate thiol redox status liver subject high hepatic steatosis fasting stage due depletion glycine . Glycine synthesize via interconversion serine serine hydroxymethyl transferase ( SHMT1 SHMT2 ) concomitant conversion tetrahydrofolate ( THF ) 5,10-methylene-THF ( CH2-THF ) . It show serine synthesis downregulated patient NAFLD supplementation serine attenuate alcoholic fatty liver enhance homocysteine metabolism mouse rat . In study , investigator aim increase liver tissue level GSH NAFLD patient short-term dietary serine supplementation improve liver function lower oxidative stress result hepatic steatosis . Ten obese patient ( BMI 30 - 39.9 kg/m2 ) ultrasound CT-verified non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . Subjects recruit Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage Study ( SCAPIS ) Gothenburg . The participant study ( 50-65-year-old men woman ) randomly recruit Swedish Population Address Register . Currently , 1050 subject analyzed 5000 additional subject analyze next 2 year . By January 2015 , 2000 subject analyze . Each subject extensively phenotyped two day . This include extensive blood sample , anthropometry , carotid liver ultrasound , CT examination include coronary calcium score , CT angiography coronary artery , thoracic aorta , assessment epicardial fat , liver fat , subcutaneous abdominal fat . Preliminary analysis first 1050 subject indicate approximately 20 % fulfill criterion NAFLD , consistent data western population .</detailed_description>
