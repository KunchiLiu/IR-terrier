	<brief_title>Lirilumab Nivolumab With 5-Azacitidine Patients With Myelodysplastic Syndromes ( MDS )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups Study Drug Administration : If find eligible take part study , assign 1 2 study group base status disease assign cohort base join study . Each study group make 2 cohort . Group 1 make Cohorts A B . Group 2 make Cohorts C D. Each cohort enroll 20 participant . Each study cycle 4 week . If low risk ( low intermediate-1 ) MDS , enrol Group 1 . - If assign Cohort A , receive lirilumab vein 1 hour 1 time cycle . - If assign Cohort B , receive nivolumab vein 1 hour every 2 week Cycles 1-9 1 time cycle . You also receive lirilumab vein 1 hour 1 time cycle . If high risk MDS , enrol Group 2 . - If assign Cohort C , receive azacitidine vein 40 minute Days 1-7 cycle . You also receive lirilumab vein 1 hour Day 7 cycle . - If assign Cohort D , receive azacitidine vein 40 minute Days 1-7 cycle . You receive lirilumab vein 1 hour Day 7 cycle . On Days 7 21 Cycles 1-9 Day 7 Cycles 10 beyond , also receive nivolumab vein 1 hour . If assign Cohorts B D , need stay clinic 1 hour dose nivolumab study staff may check vitals monitor health side effect . Both study doctor know group assign . Study Visits : One ( 1 ) time week Cycle 1 1 time cycle : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2-3 teaspoon ) draw routine test . These test may do often doctor think need . If doctor think need , Day 28 Cycle 1 every 3 month , bone marrow aspiration check status disease cytogenetic testing . Every 6 week , become pregnant , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . Length Study : You may continue receive study drug ( ) long study doctor think best interest . You longer able take study drug ( ) disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . You participation study , become pregnant , end last dose study drug ( ) . If become pregnant , participation study follow-up pregnancy test . Follow-Up Pregnancy Tests : If become pregnant , 30 day 70 day stop take study drug ( ) , blood ( 1 teaspoon ) urine collect pregnancy test . This investigational study . Lirilumab FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Nivolumab FDA approve commercially available treatment melanoma non small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Azacitidine FDA approve commercially available treatment MDS . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 80 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
