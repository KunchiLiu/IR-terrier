	<brief_title>A Comparison Electrical Pudendal Nerve Stimulation Pelvic Floor Muscle Training Plus Transanal Electrical Stimulation Post Prostatectomy Incontinence</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Conservative therapy could consider choice treatment stress urinary incontinence ( SUI ) seem side effect cause significant long-term improvement symptom . Pelvic floor muscle training ( PFMT ) electrical stimulation two commonly use form conservative treatment SUI . PFMT improve structural support pelvis . However , many patient difficulty identify isolate pelvic floor muscle ( PFM ) unable perform exercise effectively . Furthermore , patient identify PFM often find required daily exercise routine burdensome . Hence , primary disadvantage PFMT lack long-term patient compliance . Electrical stimulation ( ES ) non-invasive , passive treatment produce muscle contraction . Transanal electrical stimulation ( TES ) little side-effect , patient compliance 70-85 % publish report . TES result PFM contraction indirect nerve stimulation , mainly polysynaptic reflex response . The indirect stimulation reflexive contraction may reason effect electrical stimulation good PFMT perform correctly . By combine advantage PFMT TES incorporate technique deep insertion long acupuncture needle , develop electrical pudendal nerve stimulation ( EPNS ) . In EPNS , long acupuncture needle 0.40 Ð¥ 100 125 mm deeply inserted four sacral point electrify stimulate pudendal nerve ( PN ) contract PFM . CT transverse plane coccygeal apex show position lower needle tip similar ( adjacent PN Alcock 's canal ) Bion device implant chronic PN stimulation . Our previous study show EPNS well therapeutic effect female SUI compare PFMT + TES . Simultaneous record perineal ultrasonographic PFM contraction , vaginal pressure pelvic floor surface electromyogram previous study prove EPNS exactly excite PN induce PFM contraction female SUI patient . However , EPNS also show satisfactory effect male patient SUI problem . The purpose study compare efficacy EPNS PFMT + TES treat male SUI .</detailed_description>
