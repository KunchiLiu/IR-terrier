	<brief_summary>This study design phase-II proof concept trial investigate treatment strategy stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) give pembrolizumab sufficiently active warrant investigation randomize phase II III study . Metastatic renal cell cancer ( mRCC ) patient PD-1 express immune cell likely large aggressive tumour reduce survival renal tumour express PD-L1 aggressive poorer outcome . Blocking receptor/ligand interaction monoclonal antibody restore activity tumour specific T-cells within tumour durable response document early clinical trial several tumour type include renal cell carcinoma . The study drug pembrolizumab design directly block interaction PD-1 ligands , PD-L1 PD-L2 . SBRT give 1-3 clinically significant lesion time progression pembrolizumab 2nd course pembrolizumab treatment effort improve activity pembrolizumab . A total 35 patient refractory approve first line therapy target drug ( Sunitinib Pazopanib ) enrol study . This group patient poor outcome 2nd line therapy urgently need novel therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Proof Principle Study Pembrolizumab With SBRT TKI mRCC Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A phase II proof concept , multi-centre , safety efficacy study biomarker component investigate treatment strategy stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) give pembrolizumab sufficiently active warrant investigation randomize phase II III study . The study run approximately 3 year , include 2 year recruitment 1 year follow . There two study arm . Enrollment 15 patient arm A occur start enrollment next 20 patient arm B . In arm A , pembrolizumab start SBRT give 1-3 clinically significant lesion time progression pembrolizumab . Pembrolizumab continue progression detect addition SBRT lead stability response progress lesion . After SBRT , untreated measurable disease must remain assess activity continue pembrolizumab . Pembrolizumab SBRT continue progression per immune relate response criterion ( irRC ) . This cohort patient allow u clearly understand SBRT play part improve progression free survival give combination pembrolizumab . In arm B , pembrolizumab start SBRT give 2nd course pembrolizumab 1-3 clinically significant lesion . After SBRT , untreated measurable disease must remain assess activity pembrolizumab . The value treatment strategy combine pembrolizumab SBRT up-front evaluate arm . Giving SBRT early clinically significant cancer lesion may give pembrolizumab time work may improve response generate neo-antigens . Patients remain study progression per irRC , withdrawal consent meet premature withdrawal/discontinuation criterion .</detailed_description>
