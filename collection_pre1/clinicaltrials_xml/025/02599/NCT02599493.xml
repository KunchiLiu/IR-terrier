	<brief_summary>Rifampicin antibiotic usually require treat susceptible Staphylococcus spp . osteo-articular infection , frequently association fluoroquinolone strain susceptible agent . It reference treatment orthopedic infection implant material . For tuberculosis treatment dosage 10 mg/kg/j usually prescribe , treatment Staphylococcus spp . infection high dosage 20 mg/kg/j propose French expert ' recommendation 2009 . However , little evidence literature , could set argument choose best dosage rifampicin , may vary 5 20 mg/kg . The issue rifampicin side effect , particular long-term treatment . Many side effect may occur 10 20 % patient sometimes lead dosage reduction treatment interruption . In literature , little evidence high rifampicin dosage associate high frequency adverse effect . Depending nature toxicity , one could say hypersensitivity could independent dosage , digestive disorder may relate . Plasmatic concentration study give strong argument link high rifampicin dosage side effect occurrence rate . After oral absorption , plasmatic peak occur two five hour varies among individual also patient overtime . This particular pharmacokinetic profile could explain discrepancy adverse event ( AEs ) frequency .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>EVRIOS : Comparative Evaluation Low Versus High Doses Rifampicin</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary objective : To demonstrate daily weight-based low dose rifampicin non-inferior high dose treatment susceptible Staphylococcus spp . osteo-articular infection . Secondary objective : To compare , two treatment group ( weight-based low dose rifampicin versus weight-based high dose ) : - Possible failure rate ( bacteriological sample available clinical manifestation straightforward ) , - AEs distribution : - Those self-patient report , - Those medical biological report , - - Rifampicin dose modification : - Dosage decrease , - Treatment interruption ( temporary definitive ) , - Failure risk factor analysis , - Health cost related osteo-articular infection care : number length hospitalization , number follow-up visit , nature number biological sample prescribe group . - Comparison plan rifampicin exposure randomization group - Differences rifampicin duration ( plan versus effective duration ) accord allocate group , - Rifampicin pharmacokinetics sub-study small sample 60 patient , - Rifampicin resistance bacteriological study patient proven failure . Methodology : Non-inferiority prospective , multicentre , randomize , open-label , controlled phase IV trial evaluate two different rifampicin dosage ( high versus low dose ) treatment staphylococcal bone joint infection . Treatment : Patients randomly assign low dosage ( 10 mg/kg/j ) rifampicin group high dosage ( 20 mg/kg/j ) rifampicin group . Rifampicin treatment prescribe association another antibiotic chosen investigator accord antibiogram result . Association fluoroquinolones first choice combination , possible . The global antibiotic treatment duration depend investigator 's choice .</detailed_description>
