	<brief_summary>Very low birth weight ( VLBW ) infants health developmental problem normal birth weight full-term infant . These problem common male female VLBW preterm infant . Male VLBW infant also experience less positive mother-infant interaction female , especially mother emotionally distress . This significant problem positive mother-infant interaction function important protective factor negative health developmental outcomes associate prematurity . The source vulnerability male VLBW infants health problem , suboptimal mother-infant interaction , poor development go beyond gender socialization difference include biological factor . Identification infant maternal biological markers/predictors infant health developmental outcome could ultimately lead intervention VLBW preterm infant . The purpose study confirm testosterone rather cortisol reliable marker/predictor complication affect infant ' health outcome , mother-infant interaction , infant cognitive/motor/language developmental outcome ; male infant exhibit high sensitivity testosterone level female infant . This longitudinal study examine association steroid hormone , testosterone cortisol , level infant health , mother-infant interaction , infant cognitive/motor/language development ( 'infant development ' ) low birthweight ( VLBW , BW &lt; 1,500 g ) preterm ( gestational age &lt; 32 week gestation ) infant adjust maternal physical mental health state , infant socioemotional behavioral development , characteristic infant mother .
