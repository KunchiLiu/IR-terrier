	<brief_title>Comparative Study Haemodynamic Changes After Spinal Anaesthesia Non-obese Pregnant Women</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Pregnancy state physiological alteration result increase oxygen demand involve significant haemodynamic change include sustained rise cardiac output ( CO ) ( 30- 60 % ) stroke volume ( SV ) ( 30 % ) virtue increase blood volume This associated decrease systemic vascular resistance ( SVR ) enhance myocardial performance . When pregnancy associate obesity cardiovascular system stress . Obese pregnant woman body mass index ( BMI ) 35kg/m2 pose significant health issue risk anaesthesia related maternal mortality . Several case sudden cardiac arrest unexplained cause obese pregnants report . Obesity induce pathological change profound effect cardiac endothelial vascular function . Thus pregnancy , obesity lead increase blood volume cardiac output proportionate amount fat thus cause volume overload heart . A study conduct transthoracic echo show mean increase around 550mls cardiac output obese non-obese parturients third trimester . In contrast decrease SVR occur normal pregnancy , obesity associate increase SVR virtue increase sympathetic activity due effect hormone include leptin , insulin inflammatory mediator . This cause increase afterload 6 , 8 thus offset advantage reduce afterload normal pregnancy affect CO . This combination volume pressure overload lead systolic dysfunction . Furthermore increase heart rate pregnancy line elevate cardiac output decrease diastolic interval time myocardial perfusion cause diastolic dysfunction . Thus obese pregnant patient may present systolic , diastolic systolic diastolic dysfunction leave ventricle . Associated obstructive sleep apneoa ( OSA ) pulmonary hypertension may lead right ventricular failure . These change compromise third trimester due aortocaval compression thus reduce cardiac output placental perfusion . The large abdominal panniculus obesity add uterine vascular compression . It thus evident obese parturient woman pose increase risk cardiovascular compromise . As obesity consider global health care problem especially woman , anaesthetist increasingly face care high risk group patients.9However paucity evidence quantify cardiovascular compromise obese pregnant woman guide provision best care . Regional anaesthesia prefer technique anaesthesia , especially obese pregnant patient . Induction spinal anaesthesia cause profound haemodynamic change represent great hazard mother foetus . Evidence suggest haemodynamic change common spinal anaesthesia result hypotension cause unconsciousness , maternal nausea vomiting , dizziness include deleterious effect foetus like neonatal acidaemia lower APGAR score . However change peripheral vascular resistance , change maternal arterial pressure necessarily reflect change maternal cardiac output . These change cardiac output associate oxygen delivery pose great risk foetus . A recent review cardiovascular alteration parturient undergo caesarean delivery neuraxial anaesthesia show induction spinal anaesthesia lead decrease CO 10-35 % measure various invasive technique . Although patho-physiology pregnancy obesity echocardiography finding give u understand patient prone severe hypotension cardiovascular compromise extent alteration haemodynamic variable obese pregnant patient spinal anaesthesia study previously . Our primary aim therefore investigate haemodynamic alteration obese parturient spinal anaesthesia compare non-obese parturient . Traditionally clinicians researcher use heart rate ( HR ) BP surrogate marker cardiac output spinal anaesthesia . Managing maternal BP consider safe optimization foetal wellbeing . Recent publication emphasize keep BP baseline optimal strategy maintain CO superior maintain uterine blood flow . In addition correlation foetal compromise form umbilical artery pH umbilical artery pulsatality index well relate SV CO BP heart rate . 19 Thus measurement CO consider good approach BP optimise oxygen delivery foetus . Although pulmonary artery catheterization gold standard measure cardiac output desirable use routinely invasiveness , patient compliance potential complication . Minimally invasive CO monitor like LiDCO plus validate successfully use purpose , still require arterial line complex routine use . LiDCOrapidV2 ( LiDCO Group plc , LiDCO Limited , United Kingdom ) , incorporate CNAPTM ( continuous noninvasive arterial pressure ) module derives CO , SV , SVR continuous noninvasive arterial waveform analyse PulseCOTM algorithm avoid invasive blood pressure measurement . This study study clinical application LIDCOrapidV2 compare haemodynamic variable obese non-obese pregnant woman CS spinal anaesthesia .</detailed_description>
