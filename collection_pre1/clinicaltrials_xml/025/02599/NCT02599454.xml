	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose atezolizumab give together stereotactic body radiation therapy treat patient stage I non-small cell lung cancer remove surgery . Monoclonal antibody , atezolizumab , may interfere ability tumor cell grow spread . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Stereotactic body radiation therapy specialize radiation therapy delivers single , high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Giving atezolizumab together stereotactic body radiation therapy may kill tumor cell well treatment non-small cell lung cancer remove surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Atezolizumab Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) MPDL3280A ( atezolizumab ) give stereotactic ablative radiotherapy ( SAR ) ( stereotactic body radiation therapy ) patient inoperable stage I non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize safety profile regimen use CTCAE v4 ( Common Toxicity Criteria Adverse Events version 4 ) . II . To provide preliminary efficacy data combination determine objective response rate disease free survival use RECIST 1.1 ( Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumors ) Immune Related RECIST ( irRECIST ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To analyze serial blood change cytokine signature , fluorescence activate cell sorting ( FACS ) immunophenotyping peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMCs ) tumor infiltrate immune cell . II . To evaluate pre post treatment tumor tissue ( available ) program cell death-ligand 1 ( PD-L1 ) immune protein tumor tumor microenvironment molecular profiling subset patient sample . III . To discover biomarkers response data obtain . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study atezolizumab . DOSE ESCALATION PHASE : Patients receive atezolizumab intravenously ( IV ) 30-60 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Within 24-48 hour receive atezolizumab , patient also undergo 4-5 fraction stereotactic body radiation therapy day 1-5 course 3 . EXPANSION PHASE : Patients receive atezolizumab IV 30-60 minute day 1 . Courses repeat every 3 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Within 24-48 hour receive atezolizumab , patient also undergo 4-5 fraction stereotactic body radiation therapy day 1-5 course 3 . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
