	<brief_summary>Fats oil play important role maintain human nutrition health provide energy , essential fatty acid , act modulators many biological process ( signal transduction , immunity inflammation ) . Due difference fatty acid composition content antioxidant individual cooking oil , degree oxidative thermolytic reaction may vary oil oil . It lack human feed study investigate molecular mechanism deep-fried oil exerts adverse effect . The investigator also lack biomarkers monitor deep-fried oil exposure . Therefore , purpose study compare human body respond differently several popular uncooked deep-fried oil vary fatty acid composition respect oxylipin profile , inflammatory marker , non-targeted metabolomics , transcriptomics . The investigator recruit 20 volunteer , provide week milk shake prepare 60g olive oil , soybean oil , palm oil , camellia oil , tallow ( butter ) , deep-fried oil last 4 , respectively ; comparison no-fat milk shake control . The experiment last 10 weeks.ã€‚Each time ; serum , plasma , whole blood urine sample collect baseline , 2 hour , 4 hour . The investigator anticipate find biomarker ( ) deep-frying , contribute understand molecular mechanism deep-fried oil exert adverse effect toward health integrative omics so-called system biology approach .</brief_summary>
