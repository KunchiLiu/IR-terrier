	<brief_summary>Patients radiotherapy head neck wear immobilisation shell prevent patient movement improve treatment accuracy . These shell tend cover face potential cause anxiety distress patient , particularly suffer claustrophobia similar fear . The study use 'open-face ' shell cover face compare investigator ' current 'closed-face ' shell . The investigator obtain treatment verification x-ray image assess daily set-up error compare two shell type , ask patient radiographer experience use shell . Hypothesis : Open-face immobilisation shell offer equivalent accuracy efficiency radiotherapy delivery well accept patient radiographer compare closed-face immobilisation shell cranial radiotherapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients randomise one two group , group A act control group use investigator ' standard 3 -- point close -- face shell , group B use 3 -- point open -- face shell ( experimental group ) . Each procedure discuss patient commencement . Patients position optimal treatment position shell fabricate per manufacturer instruction pre-treatment radiographer . This follow patient planning CT scan head wear shell allow radiographer doctor localise plan treatment . At end appointment , patient ask complete first three questionnaire regard experience wear shell . Radiographers ask complete questionnaire experience use shell , complete timing data procedure . On first day treatment , radiographer discuss treatment process side effect treatment patient , treatment deliver current department protocol use linear accelerator ( linac ) . During course treatment , radiographer obtain 5 set verification image study , assess set-up error per current department policy . Where possible , treatment field use verify patient position keep radiation dos verification image low reasonably practicable ( ALARP ) . Patients ask complete two questionnaire experience , one first day one last day treatment . Radiographers also complete questionnaire day . Timing data obtain treatment fraction . The patient 's perspective planning treatment process almost identical patient cranial radiotherapy trial . The difference observe use open-face shell ( patient group B ) , completion three questionnaire , additional verification imaging .</detailed_description>
