	<brief_summary>The aim randomize , open-label clinical trial determine impact Sleep Study-Guided Multidisciplinary Therapy ( SGMT , i.e . continuous positive airway pressure behavioral therapy ) obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) sub-acute phase acute coronary syndrome cardiovascular outcome . We hypothesize SGMT result low ( 1 ) plasma NT-pro BNP level , ( 2 ) 10-year risk cardiovascular mortality base European SCORE algorithm , ( 3 ) cardiovascular event rate , compare Standard Therapy . OSA emerge cardiac risk factor prognostic marker . We report OSA prevalent independent predictor adverse outcomes patient acute coronary syndrome . In clinical trial , continuation research publication trajectory , 180 patient present acute coronary syndrome randomly assign SGMT ( n=90 ) Standard Therapy ( n=90 ) group . Both group receive guideline-mandated treatment acute coronary syndrome . Those assigned SGMT undergo sleep study . Those found OSA attend SGMT clinic run multidisciplinary team . Advice continuous positive airway pressure behavioral therapy ( weight loss , exercise , positional therapy , abstinence alcohol sleep pill ) give . The primary endpoint plasma NT-pro BNP concentration 6-month follow-up . The secondary endpoint 10-year risk cardiovascular mortality base European SCORE algorithm include age , sex , smoke status , systolic blood pressure , serum total cholesterol total/HDL-cholesterol ratio . Adverse cardiovascular event 3-year follow-up determine . In age population increase prevalence obesity , OSA potentially become increasingly important contributor cardiovascular disease . Leveraging collective expertise team cardiologist sleep physician , work benefit society advance understand cardiovascular benefit screen treat OSA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Acute coronary syndrome lead cause mortality morbidity globally . The Principal Investigator ( PI ) conduct research sleep medicine cardiovascular disease since 2007 . Our early work show obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) prevalent patient present acute coronary syndrome , carry negative prognostic implication . This Clinician Scientist Award application center potential cardiovascular benefit Sleep Study-Guided Multidisciplinary Therapy ( SGMT ) include continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) behavioral therapy patient present acute coronary syndrome , could lead potential paradigm shift patient management sub-acute phase syndrome . For application , assemble team expert cardiovascular medicine sleep medicine . Using leverage synergistic expertise assemble leader knowledge generate early part program , embark therapeutic trial . In randomized trial , 180 patient present acute coronary syndrome recruit randomized SGMT versus standard therapy ( without sleep study ) group . Both group treat guideline-mandated therapy acute coronary syndrome ( include regular cardiology outpatient clinic visit discharge ) . In allocated SGMT , overnight sleep study use level 3 portable diagnostic device carry . Those OSA ( estimate 75 % accord pilot data ) treat CPAP behavioral therapy . Plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide ( NT-proBNP ) level measure hospital discharge 6-month follow-up . The 10-year risk cardiovascular mortality base European cardiovascular risk score ( SCORE ) , include age , sex , smoke status , systolic blood pressure , serum total cholesterol total/high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) -cholesterol ratio , determine baseline 6-month follow-up . Our specific aim compare effect SGMT standard therapy : - Plasma level NT-proBNP ( Primary endpoint ) . We hypothesize SGMT associate low plasma NT-proBNP level standard therapy 6-month follow-up . - Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation ( SCORE ) . We hypothesize SGMT associate low SCORE standard therapy 6-month follow-up . - Incidence major adverse cardiac event ( extend study ) . We hypothesize SGMT associate low incidence major adverse cardiac event 3-year follow-up ( application additional funding make accomplish aim ) .</detailed_description>
