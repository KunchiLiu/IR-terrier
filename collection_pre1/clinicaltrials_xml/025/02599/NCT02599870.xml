	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate effect pharmacogenetic ( PGx ) guide treatment implement pre-operative process patient undergo elective spinal surgical procedure require post-operative acute pain management , compare group subject attribute without guidance PGx test post-surgery pain management . This study also evaluate whether PGx test reduce narcotic consumption , opioid-related adverse effect , time mobilization , medical visit cost .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Clinical Study Evaluate Clinical Impact PGx-Guided Treatment Patients Undergoing Elective Spinal Surgical Procedures</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The incidence opioid related adverse drug event reach high 50 % surgical patient poor pain management significant risk factor early readmission . In addition , rate non- response certain analgesic double patient poor metabolizers demonstrate mutation CPY26d allele . Finally , grow body literature ineffective acute pain management contribute significantly risk chronic pain syndrome . Genetics drug interaction alter pharmacokinetics pharmacodynamics multitude drug compound turn influence safety efficacy select therapeutic regimen . Pharmacogenetic-guided therapy selection enhance patient response facilitate selection appropriate medication effective dose short possible time . In prospective , randomize , single-blind study , investigator evaluate clinical impact pharmacogenetics-guided treatment duration post-surgical hospital stay patient well-being determine post-op pain assessment . Additionally , impact PGx-guided treatment narcotic consumption , number adverse event , re-admission rate cost evaluate study duration .</detailed_description>
