	<brief_summary>Background : Patients chronic kidney disease hemodialysis may reduce diffusion capacity , lung function gas exchange due mechanical hemodynamic change respiratory system , decreased respiratory muscle strength result uremic myopathy . The inspiratory muscle training ( IMT ) appear instrument improve inspiratory muscle strength , positive effect functional capacity quality life kidney patient , however , effect IMT address specific variable respiratory system date study use daily train population . Objective : To evaluate effectiveness daily inspiratory muscle train respiratory muscle strength , chest wall volume , diaphragm thickness mobility end-stage renal disease patient . Methods : A randomized control clinical trial develop Cardiopulmonary Physical Therapy Laboratory Universidade Federal de Pernambuco ( UFPE ) period November 2015 December 2016 . The sample compose 24 individual age 18 65 , CKD , perform hemodialysis least twelve month provide inspiratory muscle weakness . Patients divide two group , train group IMT POWER-breatheÂ® , load 50 % MIP , duration three set 30 inspiration , frequency two session per day , 7 day week 8 week , since sham group subject procedure ( duration frequency ) , without load . Participants assess intervention global assessment form , questionnaire Kidney Disease Quality Life Instrument Short Form - KDQOL-SF , diaphragmatic ultrasound , opto-electronic plethysmography , spirometry , manometer six-minute walk test .</brief_summary>
