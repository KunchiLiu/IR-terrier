	<brief_summary>Background : There 100 trillion microbial cell person gut . This call human gut microbiota . When disrupt , lead many disease . Studies show gut microbiota people cancer different find healthy people . Researchers want study link gut microbiota immune system people liver disease call hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . Objective : To study link gut microbiota immune system people HCC . Eligibility : People least 18 year old HCC . They must schedule tumor remove surgery . Design : - People surgery primary liver tumor Mount Sinai Medical Center screen study . - At initial visit , blood , rectal swab , urine , stool collect . Participants answer question medical condition . - Before surgery , blood , rectal swab , urine , stool collect . This do routine visit . - When surgery , piece liver tissue tumor collect . This sent National Cancer Institute test . - After surgery , blood , rectal swab , urine , stool collect 3 time . This do routine visit .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Gut Microbiota People With Hepatocellular Carcinoma ( HCC )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : The human gut microbiota consist approximately 100 trillion microbial cell whose disruption lead many disease include inflammatory bowel disease colorectal cancer name . Recent study show cancer patient alter gut microbiota compare healthy control . Intestinal microbiota propose contribute start progression number liver disease , alcoholic liver disease ( ALD ) , nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) , liver cirrhosis , hepatic encephalopathy ( HE ) , hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) . We plan investigate relationship gut microbiota immune system patient HCC . In recent year , immune regulation level tumor microenvironment become important different type cancer . Objectives : To collect blood/stool/urine/tumor sample rectal swabs HCC patient undergo resection primary liver tumor Mount Sinai Medical Center perform analysis interaction tumor , immune response gut microbiome . Eligibility : - Patients 18 year age old - Patients undergo liver resection primary liver cancer - Patients must willing provide informed consent Design - Blood , stool , rectal swab , urine and/or tumor sample may collect consent subject see Mount Sinai Medical Center initial visit and/or follow-up visit . - Tumor sample obtain patient undergoing surgery . - Patients ask answer questionnaire .</detailed_description>
