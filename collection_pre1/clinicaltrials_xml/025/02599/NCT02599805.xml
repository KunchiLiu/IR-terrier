	<brief_summary>Diabetic foot complication care represent significant burden Canadian healthcare system . The estimated annual expenditure Canada diabetic foot ulcer $ 150 million . A small sized randomize control trial ( n=17 ) investigate use topical oxygen therapy ( n=9 ) placebo ( n=8 ) diabetic ulcer do recently show 87 % average reduction ulcer size treatment group versus 46 % average reduction control group ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . Despite standard care use today diabetic foot ulcer treatment , wound may non-healing heal within appropriate time frame expect experienced clinician . Current diabetic foot ulcer standard care include : full medical assessment case , surgical intervention indicate local treatment ulcer . Given scarcity control trial specifically design review effect topical oxygen ulcer care , study contribute understanding management ulcer assess reduction ulcer size achieve use Natrox™ topical oxygen therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Diabetic foot complication care represent significant burden Canadian healthcare system . The estimated annual expenditure Canada diabetic foot ulcer $ 150 million . Topical oxygen therapy historically recognize essential antibiotic property nutrient . A number study suggest method treatment may contribute good heal wound , particularly ulcer . The Natrox™ oxygen delivery system ( ODS ) device design overcome number problem associate previous method oxygen therapy deliver continuous oxygen ulcer bed dress . It consist small battery-powered oxygen concentrator process oxygen air , portable , hold place lightweight strap . In study , seek determine effectiveness Natrox™ Topical Oxygen device patient non-healing diabetic foot/leg ulceration conjunction standard best practice . The Diabetic foot ulcer standard care include : - Full medical assessment case . - Surgical operation/Intervention indicate . - Local treatment ulcer ( debridement follow ulcer care accord `` modern ulcer heal '' standard management diabetes . ) In treatment group control group , comparative change ulcer surface area measure period 8 week analyze wound healing .</detailed_description>
