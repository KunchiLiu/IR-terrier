	<brief_summary>Currently , patient pancreatic cancer standard treatment surgery follow chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy . An investigational approach perform surgery treat area tumor intraoperative radiotherapy one procedure . Intraoperative radiation delivers low energy x-ray targeted area time tumor removal . The purpose study learn good bad effect add intraoperative radiation therapy . Another goal determine compare quality life procedure . We also monitor effect therapy cancer lesion complication may result .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intraoperative Radiation Therapy Resectable Pancreas Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study determine safety low kilovoltage radiotherapy delivery focus dose radiation area high risk locoregional recurrence follow pancreaticoduodenectomy . This surgery currently potentially curative approach patient pancreatic cancer . Unfortunately , follow surgery alone &gt; 50 % patient local recurrence disease [ 5 ] . Local control become increasingly important chemotherapy regimen continue improve distant metastases-free survival . Intraoperative radiation therapy allow direct access tumor bed area concern allow displacement shield normal tissue organ risk radiation toxicity . Study Objectives The primary objective determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) low kilovoltage ( kV ) intraoperative radiotherapy ( IORT ) The secondary objective : To develop acute chronic toxicity profile treatment modality To determine feasibility include low-kV IORT treatment pancreatic cancer To evaluate follow physic delivery parameter : treatment prescription dose , depth treatment , applicator type , treatment time . To measure patient 's quality life ( QOL ) treatment , include change pain level fatigue level . To describe disease specific outcomes local regional control , progression free-survival , distant metastasis free-survival , disease free-survival overall survival associate low-kV IORT follow pancreaticoduodenectomy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pathologically confirm pancreatic adenocarcinoma . Age ≥ 18 year . Performance status ECOG 01 . Patient must resectable disease . In order resectable follow criterion must meet : Absence distant metastasis . Clear fat plane around celiac axis , hepatic artery , superior mesenteric artery . Absence direct involvement inferior vena cava aorta . Stage I stage II disease per AJCC 7th edition . Complete history physical examination include weight ECOG performance status within 31 day entry . Laboratory data obtain ≤ 14 day prior registration study , adequate bone marrow organ function define follow : Laboratory Test Result Leukocytes ≥3000/mm3 Absolute Neutrophil Count ( ANC ) ≥1500/mm3 Platelets ≥100,000/mm3 Total Bilirubin ≤1.4 mg/dL AST ( SGOT ) , ALT ( SPGT ) ≤2.5 x institutional upper limit normal Serum creatinine ≤1.4 mg/dL INR ≤1.5 BUN &lt; 20 mg/dL Albumin ≥3.5 g/dL Negative serum pregnancy test female childbearing potential within 14 day study registration . Should female participant become pregnant suspect pregnant participating study , inform treat physician immediately . A female childbearing potential woman ( regardless sexual orientation , undergone tubal ligation , remain celibate choice ) meet follow criterion : Has undergone hysterectomy bilateral oophorectomy ; Has naturally postmenopausal least 12 consecutive month . Abdominal CT scan contrast prior performance surgery . If patient allergic contrast abdominal MRI may substitute . Other imaging may add substitute deemed appropriate treatment team ( surgeon , radiation oncologist , medical oncologist ) . Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent . Signed study specific inform consent . Patients prior history malignancy permit register study long actively take cytotoxic biologic medication treatment prior malignancy . Patient must diseasefree malignancy least previous 6 month must history brain metastasis . Consultation , agreement , documentation radiation oncologist patient suitable receive radiotherapy per protocol . Consultation , agreement , documentation surgeon patient suitable surgical candidate . Consultation , agreement , documentation anesthesiologist patient suitable receive general anesthesia . Defined treatment area adequately cover radiation field define radiation oncology treatment team . Patients receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy ineligible . Patients Stage IIIStage IV disease . Patients immunosuppressive agent ( exclude corticosteroid ) within 4 week propose operation . Patients receive investigational agent . Current pregnancy currently nurse . History brain metastasis . Severe , active comorbidity define follow Unstable angina and/or congestive heart failure require hospitalization within last 6 month . [ 23 ] Myocardial infarction within 3 month study registration [ 23 ] . Acute bacterial fungal infection require intravenous antibiotic time registration . Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease respiratory illness hospitalization preclude study therapy time registration [ 23 ] . Uncontrolled diabetes opinion patient 's physician require immediate change management . A patient may consider eligible patient 's physician managing diabetes deem appropriate change management result adequate control . [ 23 ] . BMI &gt; 30 . Patient active diagnosis bleed disorder . [ 23 ] Patients enrol another interventional clinical trial .</criteria>
