	<brief_summary>Inherent intricate allocation brain resource attention shift , postural-suprapostural task define postural control take place concurrent task perform . Recent study indicate attentional focusing alters attention allocation brain well motor performance postural-suprapostural task . Also , study demonstrate benefit induce external focus relative internal focus motor performance . However , postural difficulty might critical factor choose appropriate focusing strategy , strategy use particular difficulty level always generalize difficulty level . Besides , despite lot study do , current finding confine behavioral observation young healthy adult lack direct neural evidence . With uses H-reflex , event-related potential behavioral measure , purpose 3-year research project investigate difference performance quality intrinsic neural mechanism postural-suprapostural task old adult patient Parkinson 's disease , adopt external internal strategy suprapostural task different posture difficulty . In first year , investigator characterize suprapostural focus effect reciprocity postural-suprapostural task , special focus modulation motoneuron excitability sit stand posture healthy young old adult use H-reflex technique . In second year , adaptive selection suprapostural focus strategy investigate patient Parkinson 's disease vary stand surface ( stable/unstable surface ) . In third year , investigator investigate suprapostural focus effect brain resource allocation patient Parkinson 's disease , light event-related potential movement-related potential . The present project expect significant contribution gain good insight neural correlate concurrent postural motor suprapostural task internal/external focus strategy different posture difficulty , optimize treatment strategy old adult patient Parkinson 's disease balance multi-tasking disturbance .</brief_summary>
