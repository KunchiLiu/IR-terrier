	<brief_summary>The aim present study study expression various phosphate transporter patient normal moderately impaired renal function patient dialysis . In particular , investigator want clarify whether NaPi-IIb expression level decrease CKD patient , would render potentially inadequate pharmaceutical target patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Intestinal Phosphate Transporter Expression CKD Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Elevated serum phosphate potent predictor death cardiovascular event patient renal disease . Control serum-phosphate desire target range insufficient many patient advance chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , particular dialysis patient despite dietary restriction , optimized dialysis regimen use phosphate binder . One reason example , phosphate binder insufficient control phosphate uptake intestine even loose efficacy , compensatory upregulation phosphate transporter gut wall . Thus , several company attempt specifically interfere intestinal phosphate transporter , particular NaPi-IIb transporter . However , recent Chugai data obtain experimental CKD challenge assumption NaPi-IIb major therapeutic target situation . In addition NaPi-IIb , PiT-1 -2 also might contribute phosphate transport . In normal human intestinal mucosa prominent expression 3 transporter observe duodenum , i.e . area , easily assess endoscopy . During endoscopy biopsy research purpose obtain . Chugai evaluate expression level NaPi-IIb , PiT-1 , PiT-2 , villin1 mRNA , possible , protein level .</detailed_description>
