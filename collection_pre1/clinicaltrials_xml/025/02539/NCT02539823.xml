	<brief_title>Acute Short-term Effects CBD Cue-induced Craving Drug-abstinent Heroin-dependent Humans</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There epidemic rise heroin abuse overdose recent year . Of one million people suffer today opiate dependency , less quarter individual receive treatment . Pharmacotherapeutic approach traditionally target mu opioid receptor since heroin metabolite bind high affinity receptor subtype . Although treatment strategy improve substance abuse outcome , effectively block opiate craving thus still associate high rate relapse . Using strategy indirectly regulate neural system modulate opioid-related behavior , preclinical rodent study consistently demonstrate cannabidiol ( CBD ) , nonpsychoactive component cannabis , specifically inhibited cue-induced heroin-seeking behavior . CBD 's selective effect drug-seeking behavior pronounce 24 hr endure even two week last drug administration follow short-term CBD exposure . The fact drug crave generally trigger exposure condition cue suggest CBD might effective treatment heroin craving , specially give protracted impact behavior . CBD already show Phase I study various clinical study well tolerate wide safety margin human subject . CBD thus represent strong candidate development potential therapeutic agent human opioid crave relapse prevention . Preliminary pilot study show CBD decrease crave . It goal current study fully characterize effect CBD administration cue-induced crave drug-abstinent heroin-dependent subject use random double blind design post-acute ( great 6 day since last use ) heroin withdrawal period . Study participant administer CBD 3 test session study effect cue-induced craving session well one week final CBD administration final test day ( session 4 ) .</detailed_description>
