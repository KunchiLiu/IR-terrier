	<brief_summary>In study , single blind randomized trial third party evaluation carry order compare postpartum blood loss Ren Mai 6 point stimulate point stimulate . Investigators focus measure volume postpartum blood third stage labor first two hour birth . A significant reduction volume bleed would imply reduction rate postpartum hemorrhage ( PPH ) ( 500 ml ) rate severe PPH ( 1000 ml ) . The principal outcome study volume postpartum blood , volume measure midwife responsible birth . Collection lose blood initiate immediately birth baby pass blood collection drape woman 's buttock . The secondary outcome influence acupuncture placental expulsion time , influence predictor variable bleed volume placental expulsion time : primiparity multiparity , number gestation include abortion , dose oxytocin labor , maternal age , maternal weight begin gestation , maternal ponderal gain pregnancy , date last blood test pregnancy value hemoglobin hematocrit , spontaneous labor induction mean oxytocin prostaglandin , spontaneous artificial rupture membrane , first stage labor duration , second stage labor duration , hour since rupture membrane , hour since epidural analgesia , volume serotherapy labor , newborn weight . Possible puerperal complication security problem , degree Satisfaction Mother degree ease acupuncturist administer treatment also secondary outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study design single-blind randomized clinical trial parallel design , third party evaluation Hospital Universitario Príncipe de Asturias Alcalá de Henares ( Madrid , Spain ) . The study carry pregnant woman labor hospital . Information sheet study distribute different health care center coordinate hospital . The midwife give information sheet pregnant woman pregnancy 's attendance . The objective let pregnant woman know study labor date order encourage participate . Pregnant woman fulfil inclusion criterion none exclusion criterion invite participate experiment . These requirement include pregnant woman 18 40 year old , eutectic delivery , gestation 37 42 week , labor epidural analgesia . Concerning procedure data collection , acupuncturist request permission midwife responsible mother collaboration study pre-labor room . The acupuncturist explain study mother partner apply voluntary participation inform consent offer . All information give pregnant woman without pain labor , preferably woman epidural analgesia effect . Regarding selection patient , randomization scheme perform use envelope base method . The research opaque envelope number outside , number code patient study . After approval pregnant woman inform consent , acupuncturist open envelop indicate treatment follow , either control intervention group . So , investigator guarantee randomization , blindness unpredictable selection sample . In labor ward , delivery , baby place abdomen puerperal mother facilitate maternal link . Collection lose blood initiate immediately birth baby pass blood collection bag woman 's buttock . The birth attendant clamp umbilical cord first minute birth acupuncturist midwife perform acupuncture procedure depend group assign . In intervention group real acupuncture , umbilical cord clamp , acupuncturist disinfects abdominal area antiseptic prick needle point Ren Mai 6 . In control group puncture Ren Mai 6 perform . In case , needle cover opaque plastic cup cup set adhesive tape , guarantee midwife responsible birth puerperal woman know Ren Mai 6 acupuncture point puncture . Afterwards , midwife responsible birth expect note sign placental separation gush blood , uterine contraction , lengthen umbilical cord , visualization placenta vagina , encourage woman cough push . When placental expel , midwife pay attention time pass delivery placental expulsion , change collect bleed drape another one puerperal woman suture . Finally , nappy settle puerperal woman first two hour birth . This procedure routinely use hospital . The midwife responsible birth weight one blood collection drape , gauze use nappy , register data specific record . Taking account total weight amount material use , volume blood loss estimate . A survey fulfil acupuncturist 2 hour intervention . In survey , midwife take note level ease technique perform four possible answer ( high , moderate , medium low ease level ) . Furthermore , acupuncturist ask puerperal woman would recommend technique friend two possible answer ( yes ) . The placental expulsion time measure childbirth occur . The weight blood collect drape , gauze nappy register first two hour birth , , satisfaction professional participant note time . After period time , puerperal woman move obstetrics plant labor room . Participants followed-up hospital stay , expect average 2 day . The physician charge evaluation welfare puerperal woman annotate existence complication hospital stay medical record woman , routinely do hospital . All study perform condition respect individual right ethical principle affect biomedical research involve human . Written inform consent fulfil participant . In particular , physical mental integrity woman safeguard , well privacy data protection accordance Spanish Organic Law 15/1999 , December 13 , Protection Personal Data .
