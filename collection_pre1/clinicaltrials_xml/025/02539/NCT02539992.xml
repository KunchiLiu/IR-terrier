	<detailed_description>This study prospective , randomized evaluation ShapeMatch Cutting Guide primary total knee replacement ( TKR ) consecutive series patient meet eligibility criterion . Forty-eight case enrol receive Triathlon® Cruciate Retaining Total Knee System ( Triathlon® CR ) procedure use patient-specific cut guide reproduce natural kinematic alignment knee . Another forty-eight case enrol receive Triathlon® CR device procedure use patient-specific cut guide modify provide neutral overall limb alignment knee . And last forty-eight case receive Triathlon® CR device procedure use traditional instrumentation intend achieve neutral overall limb alignment .</detailed_description>
