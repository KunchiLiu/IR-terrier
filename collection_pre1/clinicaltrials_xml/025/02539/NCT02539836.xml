	<brief_summary>With rapid development society economy , child 's simple obesity rise world become chronic disease one big public health challenge world . It serious threat health child adulthood . The overweight obesity induce genetic environmental factor . The environmental factor important , dietary factor drive factor many chronic disease include obesity . This study focus dietary intervention childhood obesity build healthy intestinal flora . The interventing food base natural health food - fruit vegetable fermentation liquid , combine probiotic dietary factor , dietary fiber oligosaccharide . The implementation study help reveal fuction mechanism intestinal bacteria obese child normal child , construct healthy micro environment intestinal flor . According positive effect factor , study propose healthy diet nutrition intervention model obese child , significant social health especially child 's health .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Before academic examination , letter parent , informed consent volunteer questionnaire release school child guardian . We tell volunteer guardian study invite participate study . Only volunteer guardian signature letter parent inform consent able research object . Experimental procedure Two time medical exam , blood stool sample collection require whole experiment research . The first time exams sample collection carry academic examination ; second time carry intervention . Recruit research object According academic examination volunteer questionnaire , 300 healthy child without take antibiotic 3 month recruit BMI obese range . Then waist circumference ratio body fat measure . If ratio waist size weight &gt; 0.46 high percentage body fat ( &gt; 20 % boys 12 year old girl , &gt; 25 % 12 year old girl ) , data collect input database . About 40 healthy child 15-18 year old recruit participate next intervention research . General body examination In academic examination , student 's basic medical data include height weight record , BMI calculate . If his/her BMI obese range , his/her body composition measure record . Blood collection , preservation test Blood collection preservation proceed standard medical examination . When collect data obesity , test blood count , blood glucose , serum lipid liver function process obese child . When intervening , test include blood count , blood glucose , blood lipid , liver function , hemoglobin , cytokine , insulin , high sensitivity C-reactive protein , leptin somatomedin C process . Stool collection , preservation detection 50 ml centrifuge tube use collect stool sample . Each tube mark unique encode corresponds volunteer . When volunteer collect stool sample , transfer stool sample sterile centrifuge tube use sterile swab toothpick soon possible . The collecting sample 10g . The centrifuge tube put low-temperature place , transfer refrigerator store -80 ℃ DNA extraction test . The test include short chain fatty acid content ( SCFA ) , pH , water content , immune factor sIgA Calprotectin process . 16S rRNA gene sequence bacteria stool DNA extraction : For sample , 0.2g stool weight total DNA extract use fecal genomic DNA extraction Kit ( Qiagen , model DP328 ) . And concentration purity extract DNA measure use NanoDrop ( Thermo , 2000C ) guarantee sample meet sequence requirement . Sample sequencing : PCR amplification 16S rRNA gene ( V3-V4 ) perform universal forward primer 5'-ACTCCTACGGGAGGCAGCAG-3 ' reverse primer 5'-GGACTACVSGGGTATCTAAT-3 ' . The amplification system include sterile water 19.375 ul , buffer 2.5ul , template 1ul , primer 1ul , Pyrobest DNA polymerase 0.125ul . PCR cycle condition follow : 94 ℃ 5min , follow cycle include 94℃ denature 30 , 50℃ renaturing 30s,72℃ extend 30 , 72℃ extend 5min . PCR product electrophoresis perform determine appropriate PCR product different application cycle . After connect amplified product tag primer label , paired-end sequencing perform sequence platform Illumina MiSeq , read length 250bp . Intervention treatment childhood obesity PFE After 16S rRNA gene sequencing , 40 obese volunteer high school similar intestinal flora profile select participate intervention treatment research . The intervening food `` Dr. Ephraim '' plant fermentation extract ( PFE ) . Without change previous diet research object , research object drink drink 30mL PFE morning even enzyme respectively , intervention last 8 week . Before 8-week intervention , stool blood sample research object collect analyzed obtain physiological biochemical index . The 16S rRNA gene fecal sample stage sequence .</detailed_description>
