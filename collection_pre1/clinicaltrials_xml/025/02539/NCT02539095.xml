	<criteria>1 . Adult patient age 19 old 2 . Patients knee joint pain due chondromalacia , osteoarthritis ( OA ) , traumatic arthritis ( TA ) 3 . Patients 3 low score KellgrenLawrence grade 4 . Patients 40 mm high score 100 mm VAS pain scale 5 . Patients without significant pathological test screen visit 6 . Patients whose medication confirm within one week study enrolment agree maintain medication dose study period need keep take 7 . When combination drug administer , consider period drug remain body , patient take drug stably 2 week prior participate trial ( base screening , confirm patient take drug stably 1 week prior screening , enrollment injection , assess , patient confirm take drug stably 2 week prior trial could register ) . 8 . Patients , take drug anesthetic purpose ( provide subject injection ) within one week intraarticular injection , agree take antiinflammatory agent 5 consecutive day 10 day month , could stop take drug within 2 day next visit even pain observation site become severe thus additional drug require . 9 .
