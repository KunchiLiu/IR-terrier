	<brief_summary>The purpose research study see oral everolimus tolerable effective treatment sporadic Angiomyolipomas ( AMLs ) . AMLs common non-cancerous tumor kidney . They compose blood vessel , muscle cell fat cells.Everolimus already approve drug several disease like kidney cancer , study specifically see helpful people AML .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sporadic Angiomyolipomas ( AMLs ) Growth Kinetics While Everolimus</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Primary Objective 1 . To evaluate efficacy tolerability everolimus reduce tumor volume sporadic AMLs measure dynamic contrast enhance magnetic resonance imaging ( DCE MRI ) , patient might otherwise consider active surgical percutaneous intervention . Secondary Objectives 1 . To evaluate health-related quality life ( HRQoL ) subject treated everolimus sporadic AMLs . 2 . To assess growth kinetics sporadic AMLs patient treat everolimus part study demonstrate objective response well treat everolimus study suboptimal response . 3 . To measure rate surgical percutaneous ( embolization ) intervention 1 year day 1 study . 4 . To assess safety tolerability everolimus patient sporadic AML .</detailed_description>
