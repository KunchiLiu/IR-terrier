Covariates The effect covariates anti-infectives PK PK/PDs investigate order well explain BSV ultimately suggest individualized dosage regimen . It prospective PK study include 11 anti-infectives antibiotic . Six blood sample take patient dose interval . The primary PK/ PD target anti-infectives concentration MIC pathogen 50 % ( 50 % f T &gt; MIC ) 100 % ( 100 % f T &gt; MIC ) dose interval . The investigator use skew logistic regression describe effect anti-infectives exposure patient outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background aim study : Recent study suggest risk under-exposure anti-infectives critically ill adult . This under-exposure may associate poor clinical outcome well delay incomplete clinical resolution infection ; The dose regimen anti-infectives critically ill child usually base weight ( i.e . mg per Kg ) . However , between-subject variability know substantial child even critical illness ; As result , concentration effect anti-infectives unpredictable risk under- over-exposure thus genuine considerable . Rationalisation anti-infectives child therefore desirable . The purpose present study investigate , use population approach , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacodynamics ( PD ) intravenous anti-infectives include usual PK/PD target ( fT ( % ) &gt; minimal inhibitory concentration ( MIC ) ) PD endpoint ( clinical outcome ) critically ill child . The effect developmental factor related critical illness anti-infectives PK PK/PDs investigate order well explain observe between-subject variability ultimately suggest individualized dosage regimen . This prospective study conduct six paediatric service Public Hospitals Paris , France Intervention : Patient selection take place 6 paediatric service . The senior physician propose study holder parental authority whose child receive receive anti-infectives follow-up hospitalization . The senior physician give brief note holder parental authority , child able understand information . The non-oral opposition retrieval analysis data collect . No intervention charge make study .</detailed_description>
