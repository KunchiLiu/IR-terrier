	<brief_summary>This study examine benefit transcranial direct current stimulation ( tDCS ) , new tool develop safe non-invasive neurostimulation method , improve neurocognitive social cognitive function schizophrenia . This procedure non-invasive painless result increase decrease spontaneous neuronal firing brain . Its safety beneficial effect cognition demonstrate healthy individual several clinical population . In pilot study , investigator examine effect tDCS cognitive function 40 individual schizophrenia . Each participant arrive three visit , approximately one week visit . During first visit , participant interview psychiatric symptom , personal life experience , emotional well specially-trained interviewer . On three visit , participant receive one three stimulation : type tDCS design increase neuronal firing , alternative form tDCS design decrease neuronal firing , sham tDCS ( stimulation current ) . Immediately follow stimulation , participant ask complete measure mental ability , include test present computer screen paper-and-pencil test . During visit , participant also undergo standard measure brain activity ( EEG ) listen tone . The first visit last approximately five hour , two visit last approximately four hour . The project take approximately two year complete .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving Cognition Schizophrenia Using tDCS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator plan recruit 40 individual diagnose Schizophrenia . Participants range 18-55 year old . We select stable , medicated patient hospitalize change antipsychotic medication previous two month . Participants test within 12 hour take medication may affect cognition ( benzodiazepine anticholinergic ) . All medication record . The investigator expect patient relatively chronic ( mean illness chronicity approximately 15 year , base previous study ) , although select chronicity . All participant provide write informed consent receive full explanation procedure accord approval Institutional Review Boards . They arrive three visit . In first visit , consent , complete diagnostic interview , rating scale , undergo one three randomly assign stimulation condition : 1 ) anodal tDCS , 2 ) cathodaltDCS , 3 ) sham stimulation . They also undergo electroencephalography ( EEG ) procedure , order directly assess effect tDCS brain function . This visit take approximately five hour complete , break give need . Immediately follow stimulation , participant complete neurocognitive , social cognitive , EEG measure . There two 20-minute stimulation session , break one hour session . After session , participant ask complete portion basic cognitive , social cognitive , EEG measure , half measure complete first 20 minute stimulation session half complete second 20 minute stimulation session . The order administration neurocognitive , social cognitive , EEG measure randomize across participant within group . During second third visit , participant undergo remain two stimulation condition , one randomly assign condition visit . These visit take approximately four hour complete , visit separate least one week previous visit .</detailed_description>
