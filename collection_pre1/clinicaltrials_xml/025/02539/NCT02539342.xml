	<brief_title>Caphosol Study : Prevention Oral Mucositis Children , Adolescents Young Adults Receiving Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Oral mucositis , common debilitate complication cancer therapy . It inflammatory injury epithelial sub-epithelial cell oral mucosa . The incidence severity oral mucositis depend many factor include age diagnosis patient , specific treatment regimen , underlie oral hygiene genetic factor 2-4 . This range around 40 % patient get chemotherapy solid tumor 70-90 % patient get chemotherapy stem cell transplant . Oral mucositis cause significant pain , interfere eat , talk swallowing , significantly diminish enteral nutritional intake substantial negative impact quality life . Patients may require hospitalization management complication mucositis , include poor nutrition , dehydration pain . Injury oral mucosa also increase risk systemic infection . Finally , development oral mucositis may require delay dose reduction future chemotherapy course , potentially jeopardize disease cure rate . Despite known mechanism , course complication oral mucositis , consensus guideline prevention treatment chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis significant variation approach mucositis across treatment center . Caphosol ( Jazz Pharmaceuticals , Inc. Palo Alto , CA ) design part replace normal ionic pH balance oral cavity use prevent and/or treat oral mucositis . Caphosol hypothesize diffuse epithelial intracellular space permeate mucosal lesion oral mucositis . This study randomize , control trial evaluating use topical Caphosol therapy prevent oral mucositis ( Grade â‰¥ 2 ) child , adolescent young adult undergoing chemotherapy . At time enrollment , patient randomize either control arm Caphosol arm . The treatment period extend start chemotherapy continue 7 day completion chemotherapy AND ANC &gt; 500 nadir ( count recovery ) symptoms oral mucositis resolve ; whichever occurs last . Study patient recruit MACC Fund Center oncology inpatient service . Study entry open patient regardless gender ethnic background . While every effort seek include female minority patient , patient population expect different oncology study Medical College Wisconsin .</detailed_description>
