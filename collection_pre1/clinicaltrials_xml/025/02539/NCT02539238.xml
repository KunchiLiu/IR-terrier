	<brief_summary>Objectives : The primary objective project ass whether implementation new cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) train program ( longitudinal training real-time feedback ) improve CPR quality healthcare provider compare traditional training method . The secondary objective identify whether implementation new train program result cost-effectiveness . Design : Randomized trial compare new train program tradition train method cost-effectiveness alongside trial Participants set : Paediatric healthcare provider Emergency Department Alberta Children 's Hospital . Subjects enrol either intervention ( new train program ) control ( traditional training program ) random . Statistical analysis : Investigators conduct chi-square test independent t-test compare proportion excellent CPR 3 metric CPR quality intervention group control group end 12-month interval . A multi-level logistic regression linear regression model use assess effect train method time proportion excellent CPR 3 metric CPR quality . Investigators also conduct full-economic evaluation health care system prospective . cost-effectiveness express cost per increase CPR excellence accord incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ICER ) . A one-way sensitivity analysis probabilistic sensitivity analysis conduct deal uncertainty effect cost . Conclusion : The new CPR training program serve example competency-based psychomotor skill train program help healthcare provider improve quality CPR , potentially improve survival child cardiac arrest . The result study might provide evidence inform update resuscitation education guideline change way CPR training improve cost-effectiveness CPR training program .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Improving CPR Quality With Longitudinal Practice Realtime Feedback - RCT With CEA</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study utilizes randomize , parallel study design.Paediatric healthcare provider ( nurse physician ) enrol one two arm : ( 1 ) longitudinal just-in-time training real-time feedback ( intervention ) ; ( 2 ) Annual BLS recertification course ( control ) . Participants Setting : The study conduct Emergency Department ( ED ) Alberta Children 's Hospital ( ACH ) , paediatric tertiary care referral center Calgary , Alberta , Canada . Annual BLS recertification course organize healthcare provider emergency department every month healthcare provider ED schedule take course year . The investigator approach potential participant seek consent course . Intervention : longitudinal just-in-time training real-time feedback The new CPR training curriculum ( longitudinal just-in-time training real-time feedback ) provide on-demand CPR training opportunity longitudinal fashion continuous flow practice , assessment , feedback . Each CPR training station cart adult/paediatric size CPR torso manikin infant manikin . The training unit also include real-time visual feedback device provide quality CPR feedback ( depth , rate , recoil compression ) compression ( refer real time feedback ) . At end CPR practice event , unit provide summative feedback learner quality CPR ( depth , rate , recoil overall quality ) . Health care provider study easy access train unit , locate emergency department ( ED ) simulation lab . The instructional process consist 2 part , practice session assessment session . Each day , healthcare provider assign ED resuscitation room clinical shift practice CPR 2 minute real-time feedback ( enrol intervention arm study ) . Participants 2 minute continuous chest compression assume patient intubate . Training take place ED simulation lab ( locate ED ) , short 20-second walk resuscitation room . Providers encourage use train unit time resuscitation shift , also access train unit resuscitation shift . All health care provider intervention arm recommend attend practice session least week , maximum number time permitted practice . After practice session , participant present quantitative summary CPR performance ( depth , rate , residual lean force ) . Each training session last approximately 3 minute : 30 second review guideline ( short video ) , 2 minute CPR practice , 30 second participant review summative data . In order encourage participant practice , investigator ask permission ED administration offer 5 minute protect time hand-over shift research assistant record time practice participant enrol intervention group . Assessment session build instruction framework intervention . The assessment session give baseline every 3 month course one year . Assessment session run set practice session . Subjects expect complete assessment session baseline , 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 month interval . Each participant protect time ( weekly round ) assessment session . During assessment session : 1 . Real time CPR feedback available participant . Data collect analysis . 2 . Participants present quantitative summary CPR performance , enrol intervention arm . Study Design : At begin study , group undergo annual Basic Life Support ( BLS ) recertification training ensure good CPR skill acquisition baseline . All participant provide consent recruit randomize one 2 study arm . The nurse educator , member study group , generate allocation sequence online random number generator . Given attribute study , able blind participant investigator . Participants arm assess BLS recertification course baseline assessment . The baseline assessment include CPR competency test demographic information . Participants randomize intervention arm participate longitudinal just-in-time training real-time feedback program describe . Participants randomize control arm undergo current standard program annual BLS recertification participate interventional training program course year . Quantitative measure CPR quality ( compression depth , rate , recoil overall performance ) capture assessment session ( intervention control arm ) 3,6,9 12 month . For control group , second recertification course conduct 1 year , CPR performance assess way . In order ensure compliance , course instructor send reminder email participant assessment , give protected time ( i.e . academic half day ) participate assessment session . The assessment session take place Emergency Department simulation lab Alberta Children 's Hospital . Control group participant advise use train unit intervention group CPR practice course study .</detailed_description>
