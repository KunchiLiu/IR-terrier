	<brief_summary>Mycosis fungoides ( MF ) epidermotropic cutaneous T cell lymphoma characterize accumulation CD4+ T-lymphocytes skin . Early MF present erythematous patch and/or infiltrate plaque . The diagnosis early MF major diagnostic challenge differential diagnosis inflammatory dermatosis often difficult . The histopathological diagnosis also difficult delay . Therefore , important develop biomarkers and/or combination biomarkers order improve early diagnostic MF . In previous trial , investigator include 490 patient study aim identify skin biomarkers early MF . Several activate inhibit KIRs find interesting skin diagnostic MF , mainly KIR2DL4 KIR3DL2 . Investigators later evaluate blood biomarkers patient erythrodermic MF Sezary Syndrome ( SS ) . This French institutional study demonstrate identification PCR combination 4 blood marker ( CD158k/KIR3DL2 , PLS3/T-Plastin , Twist NKp46 ) allow reliable diagnosis lymphoma erythrodermic patient . This previously publish study interestingly show 30 % 50 % patient early MF express least one biomarkers blood ( unpublished data ) . Other group also recently show TOX diagnostic tool MF . The aim study establish accurate blood diagnosis early suspect MF demonstrate newly identify biomarkers combination [ 5 cutaneous KIR receptor marker ( KIR2DS1 , KIR2DS3 , KIR3DL1 , KIR2DL4 , KIR3DL2 ) 5 blood biomarkers ( TOX , Twist-1 , PLS3/T-plastin , KIR3DL2 , NKp46 ) ] differentially express patient MF patient inflammatory dermatosis closely resemble MF lesion . Statistical analysis establish best combination blood biomarkers allow differentiation two group patient , combination could represent suitable diagnostic tool early MF .</brief_summary>
