	<brief_title>A Study To Evaluate Safety , Tolerability , And Pharmacokinetics Of PF-06266047 In Healthy Adult Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description />
	<criteria>1 . Healthy female subject nonchildbearing potential and/or male subject , time screening , age 18 55 year , inclusive . Healthy define clinically relevant abnormality identify detailed medical history , full physical examination , include blood pressure pulse rate measurement , 12lead ECG clinical laboratory test . Female subject nonchildbearing potential must meet least one follow criterion : 1 . Achieved postmenopausal status , define follow : cessation regular menses least 12 consecutive month alternative pathological physiological cause ; serum folliclestimulating hormone ( FSH ) level confirm postmenopausal state ; 2 . Have undergone document hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy ; 3 . Have medically confirm ovarian failure . All female subject ( include female tubal ligation ) consider childbearing potential . 2 . Body Mass Index ( BMI ) 17.5 30.5 kg/m2 ; total body weight &gt; 50 kg ( 110 lb ) . 3 . Evidence personally sign date informed consent document indicate subject inform pertinent aspect study . 4 . Subjects willing able comply schedule visit , treatment plan , laboratory test , study procedure . 5 . Subject must willing avoid direct sunlight exposure high intensity ultraviolet light exposure , first day dose study medication followup visit ; apply sun cream/lotion high sun protection factor , appropriate . 1 . Evidence history clinically significant hematological , renal , endocrine , pulmonary , gastrointestinal , cardiovascular , hepatic , psychiatric , neurologic , allergic disease ( include drug allergy , exclude untreated , asymptomatic , seasonal allergy time dose ) . 2 . Any condition possibly affect drug absorption ( eg , gastrectomy ) . 3 . A positive urine drug screen . 4 . History regular alcohol consumption exceed 14 drinks/week female 21 drinks/week male ( 1 drink = 5 ounce ( 150 mL ) wine 12 ounce ( 360 mL ) beer 1.5 ounce ( 45 mL ) hard liquor ) within 6 month Screening . 5 . Treatment investigational drug within 30 day ( determined local requirement ) 5 halflives precede first dose study medication ( whichever longer ) . 6 . Screening supine blood pressure &gt; 140 mm Hg ( systolic ) &gt; 90 mm Hg ( diastolic ) , follow least 5 minute supine rest . If blood pressure ( BP ) &gt; 140 mm Hg ( systolic ) &gt; 90 mm Hg ( diastolic ) , BP repeat two time average three BP value use determine subject 's eligibility . 7 . Screening supine 12lead ECG demonstrate QTc &gt; 450 msec QRS interval &gt; 120 msec . If QTc exceed 450 msec , QRS exceed 120 msec , ECG repeat two time average three QTc QRS value use determine subject 's eligibility . 8 . Subjects ANY follow abnormality clinical laboratory test screen , assess studyspecific laboratory confirm single repeat , deem necessary : Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) /serum glutamic oxaloacetic aminotransferase ( SGOT ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) /serum glutamic pyruvic aminotransferase ( SGPT ) &gt; 1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) ; Total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x ULN ; subject history Gilbert 's syndrome may direct bilirubin measure would eligible study provide direct bilirubin &lt; ULN . 9 . Pregnant female subject ; breastfeed female subject ; male subject partner currently pregnant ; male subject able father child unwilling unable use highly effective method contraception outline protocol duration study least 28 day last dose investigational product longer base upon compound 's halflife characteristic . 10 . Use prescription nonprescription drug dietary supplement within 7 day 5 halflives ( whichever longer ) prior first dose study medication . As exception , acetaminophen/paracetamol may use dos &lt; 1 g/day . Limited use nonprescription medication believe affect subject safety overall result study may permit casebycase basis follow approval sponsor . Herbal supplement hormone replacement therapy must discontinue least 28 day prior first dose study medication . 11 . Blood donation ( exclude plasma donation ) approximately 1 pint ( 500 mL ) within 56 day prior dose . 12 . History sensitivity heparin heparininduced thrombocytopenia . 13 . Unwilling unable comply Lifestyle Guidelines describe protocol . 14 . Subjects investigational site staff member directly involved conduct study family member , site staff member otherwise supervised investigator , subject Pfizer employee directly involve conduct study . 15 . Other severe acute chronic medical psychiatric condition laboratory abnormality may increase risk associate study participation investigational product administration may interfere interpretation study result , judgment investigator , would make subject inappropriate entry study . 16 . Any subject consider risk suicide self harm base investigator judgement and/or detail risk assessment . 17 . Use tobacco nicotinecontaining product excess equivalent 5 cigarette per day .</criteria>
