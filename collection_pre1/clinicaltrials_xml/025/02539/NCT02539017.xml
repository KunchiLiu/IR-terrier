	<brief_summary>As special type breast cancer , triple negative breast cancer characteristic high recurrence rate ( 2 year surgery ) , high distant metastasis rate , poor prognosis short survival time . No matter home abroad , clinical research triple negative breast cancer mainly focus find new drug new treatment strategy order reduce recurrence distant metastasis rate . The DC/CIK cell immunotherapy combine chemotherapy clinical study metastatic triple negative breast cancer already confirm benefit . This study base theory optimal timing cellular immunity host tumor load small state . Put forward hypothesis DC/CIK cell immunotherapy combine chemotherapy may improve disease-free survival overall surviva triple negative breast cancer operation . The investigator intend use RCT , observe clinical significance cellular immune adjuvant therapy triple negative breast cancer 340 patient TNBC . Do safety evaluation cellular immunity adjuvant treatment breast cancer treatment , explore clinical strategy breast cancer immunotherapy .</brief_summary>
