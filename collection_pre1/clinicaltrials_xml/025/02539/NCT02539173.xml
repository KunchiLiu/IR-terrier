	<brief_summary>1 . INTRODUCTION AND MAIN OBJECTIVES The incidence diaphragmatic paralysis inter-block scalénique vary 30 100 % literature . Its clinical impact mostly absent paralysis regress block lift . When suspect , diagnose chest radio , show elevation dome . The objective study evaluate incidence diaphragmatic paralysis measure thickness diaphragmatic quantitative assessment diaphragmatic contraction noninvasive ultrasound scan feasibility measure SSPI unit ( post-interventional monitoring unit ) scan ( ultrasound ) usual way use block ultrasound scan . 2 . STUDY TYPE Prospective , single-center clinical study routine care involve 50 consecutive patient schedule undergo surgical procedure area shoulder arm locoregional analgesia inter-block type scalénique supraclavicular ultrasound scan indicate . 3 . START OF THE STUDY February 2014 expect duration six month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . TITLE OF STUDY Diagnosis diaphragmatic paralysis interscalene block measure inspiratory diaphragmatic thicken incidence observe clinical consequence . 2 . OBJECTIVES OF THE STUDY 2.1 Primary Objective : To evaluate incidence clinical impact diaphragmatic paralysis interscalene block ultrasound . To evaluate clinical consequence paralysis . Quantify diaphragmatic paralysis : paralysis present always complete . 2.2 Secondary objective : Assess feasibility measure diaphragmatic thickening mean simple diagnostics , rapid , non-invasive non-irradiating bedside anesthetist charge patient conventional ultrasound equipment available operating room without staff intervention Outdoor ( radio manipulator , radiologist ) . 3 . STUDY TYPE Single-center prospective study routine care involve 50 consecutive patient conduct February 2014 6 month . 4 . LOCATION OF THE STUDY The study take place recovery operate theater hospital Saint Joseph 185 Rue Raymond Losserand 75014 Paris . The information collection patient consent hold pre-anesthetic visit . 5 . RUNNING OF THE STUDY 5.1 Study Population Major patient schedule undergo surgical procedure area shoulder arm locoregional analgesia inter-block type scalénique supraclavicular ultrasound indicate . 5.2 anesthetic Protocol Block design : recommend SFAR , usual procedure In immediate preoperative patient monitor infused , fractionate ultrasound-guided injection 20 ml 7.5 % Naropin . The surgery perform general anesthesia accord usual anesthetic protocol . 5.2 Recruitment Mode Preoperatively pre-anesthetic visit , patient inform purpose study . Written consent collect oral write information . 5.3 Data collection The collect data patient ASA , weight , age , gender , block type , type surgery , occurrence complication ALR , administration prophylactic antibiotic dexamethasone , respiratory pathology history , renal function , drug class premedication , occurrence respiratory complication . The data enter EXCEL spreadsheet whose treatment remain internal GHPSJ . 5.4 Ultrasound examination diaphragm It non-invasive non-irradiating . The diaphragmatic thickening recovery measure completion anesthetic block use ultrasound system , ultrasound probe aqueous gel trans-thoracic approach . It measure thickness deep inspiration expiration supine position . Each measurement repeat twice . This measurement series last 4 minute , repeat 15 minute completion engine block block find contralateral . The total measurement time 12 minute . 5.5 Diagnosis diaphragmatic dysfunction Diaphragmatic paralysis recognize inspiratory diaphragmatic thicken fraction le 20 % . 7 . SCHEDULED DATE FOR START OF THE STUDY : FEBRUARY 2014 9 . PLANNED DURATION OF THE STUDY : 6 MONTHS</detailed_description>
