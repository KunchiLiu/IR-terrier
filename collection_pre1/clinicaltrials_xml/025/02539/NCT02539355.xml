	<brief_summary>Obesity risk factor several common cancer , include breast , colon , liver , pancreas . Proposed molecular link obesity type cancer include systemic inflammation , hyperinsulinemia , change serum concentration sex steroid hormone adipokines . All strongly link low-grade chronic inflammatory process expand adipose tissue . The objective proposal test hypothesis adipose tissue inflammation reduce food eat .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Overweight obese individual evidence insulin resistance enrol , 16 complete study procedure . Enrolled subject randomize follow one two healthy diet 12 week determine diet affect inflammation body sugar insulin level blood . We address follow specific aim : Primary specific aim : To investigate whether consumption either diet reduces metabolic activation adipose tissue macrophage ( ATM ) assess quantify ATM cell surface expression ( relative mean fluorescence intensity , rMFI ) metabolic activation marker , CD36 ABCA1 . Secondary specific aim 1 : To compare study diet affect endpoint downstream metabolic activation ATM , specifically ( ) adipose tissue expression key pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α ( TNFα ) interleukins ( IL ) -1 beta 6 ; ( b ) adipose tissue expression key anti-inflammatory adipokine , adiponectin ; ( c ) systemic insulin sensitivity , assess Matsuda-DeFronzo Insulin Sensitivity Index ( ISI ) , base 3-hour frequently sample oral glucose tolerance test ( FS-OGTT ) ; oral glucose tolerance , assess measure total area-under-the-curve glucose FS-OGTT . Secondary specific aim 2 : To compare impact study diet low-grade chronic systemic inflammation , assess measure concentration high sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hsCRP ) , IL-6 , total adiponectin fast plasma . Secondary specific aim 3 : To assess dietary adherence two dietary intervention group . Dietary adherence measure dietary adherence score ( separately diet ) , base repeat 4-day diet record complete participant study . Because study endpoint think link gut microbiota , effect diet may mediate change gut microbiota , also collect stool sample participant complete study .</detailed_description>
