	<brief_summary>A double blind randomize control study compare pre-procedural IV Paracetamol versus IV placebo ( normal saline ) . The patient randomize either receive IV paracetamol saline infusion undergo radiofrequency lesioning two level medial branch nerve lumbar facet . The primary outcome potential difference pain control . The secondary outcome change quality life ( QoL ) activity daily live ( ADLs ) . We also compare potential difference amount post-procedure pain medication take patient wing study</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Trial Intravenous Paracetamol v . Placebo Patients Receiving Radiofrequency Ablation Medial Branch Facet Nerve</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The experiment take place Chaim Sheba TelHashomer Medical Center , Tel Aviv , Israel . Patients recruit hospital 's Pain Management outpatient facility appropriate procedure involve Radiofrequency Ablation Medial Branch Facet Nerve . After receive hospital 's Helsinki approval , P.I . and/or designated staff department approach relevant patient ( line mention inclusion exclusion criterion ) , describe procedure , collect inform consent patient interested participating . Consent obtain patient patient visit option RF agree upon scheduled future . Subjects receive monetary compensation . It stress prospective subject participation research implication treatment hospital , relationship current healthcare provider . The patient advise may unconditionally revoke consent give time participation without repercussion future care . Pt advise may withdraw participation time . Data collect experiment kept secure location shred project 's completion . All information regard patient treatment inside outside project keep utmost confidentiality , respect legal ethical constraint . Patients double-blindedly assign either IV Paracetamol Placebo group arrive normally schedule appointment Radiofrequency ablation Median Branch Facet Nerve . Both randomization blind do pharmacy Tel Hashomer . Paracetamol also store procured Tel Hashomer pharmacy . Patients advise neither medical staff know receive . Patients receive slow-infusion either Placebo ( normal saline ) IV Paracetamol 1 g/100 ml solution period 15 minute prior start procedure . During stage patient monitor , initial VAS score record , pre-operative vital sign assess ( e.g.- B/P , HR , SO2 . ) The parameter record RF well . All saline bag number , mixed , hung one nurse work preprocedure/admission area pain department . The nursing staff hold log book contain numbered IV infusion patient receives , record patient record future reference . The treat physician , circulate nurse , patient knowledge whether patient receive Paracetamol Placebo . The patient enter procedure room undergo radiofrequency ablation infusion IV Paracetamol/Placebo complete . The patient sign consent procedure . The patient place prone position . The area skin procedure perform prepared draped standard sterile fashion . 1.5cc Midazolam give lite anesthesia . Fluoroscopy use identify specific site injection radiofrequency . Lidocaine 1 % inject site procedure provide local anesthesia . Radiofrequency probe needle place determine medial branch fluoroscopic guidance , confirmation placement establish electrical parameter . The dilution 2cc Lidocaine 1 % 1cc Depomedrol 40mg inject prior ablation nerve . Ablation nerve conduct thermal heat 80 degree Celsius one minute nerve . 3cc solution Lidocaine 1 % + Depomedrol 40mg inject around nerve ablation perform . A sterile bandage place needle entry point , patient transfer recovery area monitoring . Following procedure patient take recovery room pain clinic monitor 30 minute . Vitals assess immediately post-op recovery room 30 minute , prior discharge . They ask get recovery room 30 minute , prior discharge , assess level pain . Requests additional analgesia ( Optalgin , etc ) assess . Pt ask 0 minute 30 minute follow entry recovery room experience number side effect response note record . Patients provide packet contain copy Oswestry Roland Disability Questionaires . The patient complete questionaires daily ( noon ) first week weekly remain 5 week follow . The questionnaire evaluate patient ' pain level , level functioning , measure quality life . All patient see follow appointment treat pain physician Pain Department Tel HaShomer 6 week follow procedure . Patients return journal vitals , pain assessment score , symptom ( ) assess final visit . Results A comprehensive review statistical analysis data conduct completion study . Changes pain score , report patient via VAS score , analyze change pain score time . Cumulative VAS score group compare use Mann-Whitney U-test t-test . Changes ADL QoL measure use Roland Disability Questionnaire Oswestry low back pain disability scale . Both Roland Disability Questionnaire Oswestry score complete patient procedure six week completion . Results statistically analyze Mann-Whitney U-test t-test .</detailed_description>
