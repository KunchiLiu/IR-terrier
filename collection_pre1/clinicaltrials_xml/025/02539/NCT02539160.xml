	<detailed_description>Patients diabetes mellitus ( DM ) increase risk atherothrombotic event . Importantly , DM key risk factor development chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) , enhance atherothrombotic risk . These observation underscore importance antiplatelet therapy prevention atherothrombotic recurrence high-risk patient . Clopidogrel widely use platelet P2Y12 receptor inhibitor . However , despite clinical benefit , patient DM CKD frequently experience recurrent atherothrombotic event . This may part due impaired pharmacokinetic ( PK ) pharmacodynamic ( PD ) effect clopidogrel patient DM CKD . Since DM CKD represent pandemic public health problem , prevalence double next 20 year , identify antiplatelet agent favorable PK/PD profile key importance . Ticagrelor oral , reversible , non-competitive P2Y12 receptor inhibitor potent consistent platelet inhibition clopidogrel . In large-scale clinical investigation , ticagrelor significantly reduce ischemic event great extent clopidogrel , find consistent also among DM patient . In patient CKD , ticagrelor lead even great relative risk reduction ischemic event , include cardiovascular mortality , compare patient without CKD . However , date analysis efficacy ticagrelor DM patient accord CKD status . Moreover , although PD study show enhanced platelet inhibition associate ticagrelor , unknown may affect CKD status . Ultimately , PK/PD profile different ticagrelor dose regimen may affect DM CKD status also unknown . The propose study aim show impact CKD status among patient DM CAD PD PK profile ticagrelor use 2 dos ( 90mg bid 60mg bid ) set prospective , randomize , cross-over trial .</detailed_description>
