	<brief_summary>Sacrococcygeal local anesthesia show reduce time spend operating room well recovery room . In addition , decrease hospital stay postoperative analgesic consumption . Given effectiveness sacrococcygeal local anesthesia pilonidal sinus surgery , would valuable study effect local anesthesia 75µg/mL clonidine versus 150µg/mL .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sacrococcygeal Local Anesthesia With Different Doses Clonidine Pilonidal Sinus Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design sample This prospective study randomize double-blind design conduct October 2015 October 2016 . Patients schedule pilonidal sinus surgery include . Patients randomly distribute one 2 group 30 patient , use seal envelope technique . Group one receive sacrococcygeal local anesthesia 75µg/mL clonidine , group two receive sacrococcygeal local anesthesia 150µg/mL clonidine . Anesthetic technique Being double-blinded study , specialize nurse prepare syringe patient . Sacrococcygeal local anesthesia technique The Sacrococcygeal block perform patient prone position . Four injection site mark skin aseptic preparation . The site place follow : 4 cm pilonidal sinus 3 cm lateral center side . Therefore `` lozenge '' form connect 4 site . At first , injection 0.3 ml lidocaine 1 % injected site use 8-mm 30G needle . Then 4 injection admit 4 injection site turn , equal supply anesthetic mixture follow manner : 10-mm 27G needle contain anesthetic mixture introduce perpendicularly skin mixture infiltrate . The needle partially withdraw reinserted 45 degree skin aim towards center pilonidal sinus injection perform . Then needle partially withdraw reinserted angle 45 degree skin aim one side lozenge side injection do . In case multiple pilonidal orifice , hexagon do . These site anesthetize previously describe . Anesthetic mixture For group 1 , syringe contain : lidocaine 2 % 14 mL , bupivacaine 0.5 % 5 mL , clonidine 0.5 mL 0.5 mL saline ( thus 75 µg/mL ) . As group 2 , syrinx contain : lidocaine 2 % 14 mL , bupivacaine 0.5 % 5 mL , clonidine 1 mL ( thus 150 µg/mL ) . Depending patient 's weight type pilonidal sinus , anesthetic mixture might vary 30 40 mL total . Data collection Demographic data , type duration surgery record . Haemodynamics register time ( pre-operatively , intra-operatively post-operatively ) . Pain assess use VNRS 0 pain 10 maximum pain 48 hour post-operatively . As postoperative analgesia consumption , patient VNRS score less 3 give paracetamol 1000 mg 8 hour . If VNRS three four , patient give Tramadol Hydrochloride 50-100 mg every 4- 6 hour VNRS score great equal five , patient receive 1 mg/kg Dolosal . Return normal activity define ability sit , walk work comfortably assess call patient .</detailed_description>
