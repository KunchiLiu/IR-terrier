	<brief_summary>The abacavir ( ABC ) /dolutegravir ( DTG ) /lamivudine ( 3TC ) 600 milligram ( mg ) /50 mg/300 mg fixed-dose combination ( FDC ) tablet currently approve United States ( US ) Europe . Although pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , safety tolerability ABC/DTG/3TC FDC tablets extensively studied subject Japanese heritage , parameter exclusively assess Japanese subject . To support marketing application Japan , single-dose , open-label study characterize PK , safety tolerability ABC/DTG/3TC FDC tablet adult Japanese healthy subject . A maximum 12 subject enrol approximately 10 evaluable subject complete study . The study consist screening , treatment phase ( single oral dose fast state ) follow-up visit ( within 7-14 day last PK sample collect ) . The total duration study subject approximately 48 day .</brief_summary>
