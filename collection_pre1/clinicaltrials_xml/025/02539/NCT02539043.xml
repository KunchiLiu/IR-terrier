	<brief_title>Effects Ultrasound Cavitation Focused Located Adiposity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study double-blind randomized clinical trial , precede pilot study due lack data literature impossible calculate size adequate sample . The overall objective study evaluate effect cavitation ultrasound focadalizado localized adiposity associate lymphatic drainage effect stereodynamic . The specific objective : Evaluate compare effect focus ultrasound cavitation reduce hypodermic layer anthropometric measurement woman ; To evaluate acute chronic effect technique ; To evaluate reduction adipose tissue layer ultrasound image ; Evaluate compare reduction fat layer intergroup intragroup photographic image ; Evaluating compare serum biochemical parameter ( total cholesterol , triglyceride , HDL cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , glucose , urea creatinine ) woman undergo focused ultrasound cavitation ; Evaluate compare technical efficiency group A ( without stereodynamic drainage ) B ( stereodynamic drainage ) . This study conduct 28 volunteer , respect criterion inclusion exclusion previously cite read sign free clear consent . Participants divide 02 group randomly . Randomization perform use local random distribution www.random.org tool , order prevent researcher identify intervention perform patient . The generation sequence number shall make researcher `` blind '' study , selection patient inclusion exclusion criterion . The sequence number use randomization keep confidential time intervention Participants undergo 4-week control period first ( base ) second evaluation ( pre-treatment ) , participant It control , ensure possible change may find end project related procedure influence lifestyle habit . During period research subject instruct alterararem respective routine activity . 08 session conduct Cavitational Focused Ultrasound individual application , per week , total 08 week treatment . The first collection ( pre-treatment ) carry data collection . Data collection consist : - Questionnaire habitual physical activity Baecke - base period ask participant answer quiz knowledge routine physical activity ; - Perimetry - anthropometric measurement measure previously train evaluator . During measurement circumference tape adjust body , directly skin order provide reliable measurement possible , without occurrence tape pressure subcutaneous tissue cause deformity . These data verify four stage : pre-treatment , first session first session eighth treatment session . They measure : Height : determine balance rule couple degree 1 mm , individual back , upright stand position , foot together , try put posterior surface heel , pelvic shoulder girdle contact instrument ; Body weight measure traditional mechanical scale 100g graduation , front man , upright position , foot together , wear light clothes without shoe ; Body Mass Index ( BMI ) - Based height weight hold calculate BMI , kg ÷ height x height ; Abdominal skin fold , use estimate percentage body fat take use caliper . It measure abdominal crease , anatomical reference umbilicus , ply region locate 1 3 cm right scar parallel longitudinal axis body ; Waist circumference measure use measure tape position parallel ground , measurement take previous iliac crest 5 cm previous iliac crest 10 cm iliac crest waist earlier ; Hip circumference , tape measure parallel ground position term point trocantéricos right left , individual assess foot together ; Thigh circumference also feature principle describe , use indication circumference change unrelated treatment , change induce weight loss . - Bioimpedance - Evaluations shall perform professional training experience type analysis . Obtaining bioimpedance take place two stage : base period ( pre-treatment ) end treatment ( eighth session ) . For examination , use Maltron BF-900 model system adopt protocol recommendation propose European Society Clinical Nutrition Metabolism : To assess body mass height individual time examination ; Fasting individual drink alcohol least 8 hour ; Urinate exam ; Not perform physical exercise eight hour test ; No injury skin electrode ; Clean skin alcohol ; Position electrodes always side body ; Minimum 5 cm distance electrode ; Separate arm trunk 30 ° 45 ° legs apart ; The environment duty neutral ( electric magnetic field ) ; It observe body shape risk possible anomaly ( edema , amputation , atrophy , scoliosis , dystrophy ) ; When prostheses implant , measure opposite side ( KYLE et al , 2004 ) ; You use metal object examination earring , bracelet , watch like ; There may conduct subject pacemaker pregnancy . - Ultrasound diagnosis - use analyze measure hypodermic layer assess region . This measure professional training experience type evaluation . The evaluator collect image basic period ( 4 week start treatment ) first last login session . The result examine software order ass thickness statistic image define image ultrasound . To collect individual supine position , head position navel fat thickness measure inner layer skin aponeurosis rectus abdominis muscle middle Alba line area . The fat thickness measurement perform linear probe ( 7.5 MHz ) depth 4 5 cm . - Blood collection - The analyzes perform serum obtain venipuncture , overnight fast 12 hour . 02 held series biochemical assessment patient , collection last maximum 30 second . The first sample time perform baseline , i.e. , control period . The second collection hold end treatment Focused Ultrasound Cavitational . After harvest , material centrifuge 3500 rpm / 10 minute analysis perform . Samples collect person train , latex glove use . They analyze : total cholesterol , triglyceride , HDL cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , glucose , urea creatinine . - Photo documentation - To carry photo , standard procedure order maintain quality , angle light always , observe result compare reliably . Initially , patient use swimsuit , photograph stand front lateral plane ( side ) parallel plane camera sensor . The camera mount tripod , level horizontal position , 105mm lens place proper height frame abdominal region , distance 1 meter . The flash mount hot shoe camera , set TTL mode drive diffuser head direct forward . The camera display manual mode , f5.6 aperture , shutter speed 1/60 second ISO 200 . The image take base period treatment record RAW format . The computational treatment image make batch , image suffer treatment transform shade gray . For image analysis , randomization result photographs held , deliver two blind evaluator ( physiotherapist ) invite participate project carry analysis . They know patient image belong , correct order application image . The evaluation follow : receive photo random order put progression order session , 2 time : treatment . After correct organization , assess image qualitatively . Importantly , designate evaluator person extensive knowledge procedure . The photographic analysis perform two stage : Step 1 : The evaluator receive slide 6 photo patient , random order ( photographs black white , interfere result ) . The evaluator classify image order 1 2 , 1 treatment , treatment 2 refer reduction localize fat deposit abdominal region ( expect treatment reduce action abdominal region , sort order ) . They receive 3 slide patient , contain image respective region measure : front , right profile leave profile . Step 2 : evaluator classify change abdominal region , one degree scale : 0 % = change ; 1 % - 25 % = little change ; 25-50 % = change term improvement , nothing extremely significant ; 50 % = change reduction localize fat abdominal area visible / improve considerably .</detailed_description>
