	<brief_summary>The purpose study find Lidco Rapid ( monitor tool give cardiac output ) equivalent determine hemodynamic assessment cardiac surgical scenario often use pulmonary artery catheter , much invasive Lidco Rapid . This accomplished online survey different cardiac surgery scenario distribute cardiac fellowship trained anesthesiologist . The online base survey include specific scenario detail scenario represent image format brief description patient aid analysis situation .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Hemodynamic Survey Cardiac Surgical Scenarios</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data PA catheter PA pressure , pulmonary wedge pressure cardiac output widely use various clinical situation warrant advance hemodynamic monitoring . It consider gold standard unfortunately always risk associate PA catheter time lag clinical event interpretation . Lidco Rapid one non-invasive hemodynamic tool measure various parameter . It widely use intensive care set goal direct therapy unfortunately enough data show whether useful various peri-operative clinical condition . In online base survey , responses participant record nominal scale ( 1 5 3 represent near normal ) . This survey help determine whether Investigators replace Lidco clinical situation warrant advance hemodynamic monitoring . No previous study do specifically find hemodynamic component differs tool intraoperatively vary hemodynamic condition cardiac surgery although study compare trend cardiac output difference opinion accuracy .</detailed_description>
