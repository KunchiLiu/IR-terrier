	<detailed_description>Influenza infection relate significant morbidity mortality child . The commonly used trivalent inactive influenza vaccine ( TIV ) document poor immunogenicity child , particularly less 2 year old . The live attenuated influenza vaccine ( LAIV ) show improved efficacy compare TIV , however LAIV unable administer child 2 year old contraindication , hence effective alternative require . The focus toward adjuvanted influenza vaccine child , particularly MF59 adjuvant , show promising result relation safety efficacy . This study aim explore MF59 adjuvanted influenza vaccine gene expression perspective use system biology approach relate finding innate immune response , immunogenicity reactogenicity . The MF-59 adjuvant approve human use 1997 study initially elderly recently child young 6 month . MF59-ATIV ( Fluad® , Gripguard® ( France ) Chiromas® ( Spain ) ) approve Europe adult age 65 year administered 5000 child clinical trial . In recent large study 4000 child age 6 month 72 month , MF59-ATIV significantly reduce rate laboratory-confirmed influenza absolute efficacy 86 % , demonstrate vaccine effective option vaccinate child le 2 year old unable live attenuate vaccine . Unpublished data ADITEC Flu pilot study conduct 2012 ( EudraCT Number : 2012-002443-26 , Ethics Ref : OxREC C 12/SC/0407 ) ; phase 2 , randomise , open label study , also demonstrate increased immunogenicity relatively similar reactogenicity profile follow ATIV immunisation compare TIV . This study use system biology approach identify early gene signature relate common innate adaptive immune pathway follow prim boost ATIV , correlate result HAI response child adults.The system biology approach use previously vaccine research identify gene module expression , include study focus description gene expression follow yellow fever vaccine ( YF-17D ) , LAIV TIV adult . The study aim assess early gene transcriptional response prim boost MF59-ATIV child age 13-24 month adult age 18 - 65 year , establish correlation HAI titer . It open label study 90 healthy child allocate 3 group ( group 1 , 2 3 ) 30 healthy adult allocate group 4 . Each participant initial visit screening complete informed consent take . The participant enrol allocate study participant number time . This initial visit ( 'Screening visit ' ) occur within 56 day prior first ATIV immunisation . Group allocation occur screen visit . Each child receive 2 dos ATIV adult receive 1 dose . ATIV currently license child , look previous study , ATIV give child less 36 month two 0.25 ml injection 4 week apart , follow immunisation schedule study . The timing blood sample take study differ group order minimise number blood collection per child still enable assessment gene expression immune response multiple time point .</detailed_description>
