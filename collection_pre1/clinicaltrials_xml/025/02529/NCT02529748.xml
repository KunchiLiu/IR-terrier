	<brief_summary>Dermal transfer efficiency define amount material move one surface another following contact . The investigator propose measure dermal transfer efficiency follow pathway : ( 1 ) object skin , ( 2 ) skin skin , ( 3 ) skin mouth , ( 4 ) clothing skin , ( 5 ) glove skin , ( 6 ) air skin . First , quantitative dermal transfer measure two select test substance ( lead , Tinopal ) six pathway . The relative quantity dermal transfer also compare different transfer pathway ( e.g. , skin skin transfer great less clothing skin transfer ? ) . And second , pattern transfer characterize semi-quantitatively ( e.g. , dermal transfer occur consistently evenly skin different reservoir ? ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Pilot Study Assess Quantitative Dermal Transfer Efficiencies Solids Multiple Transfer Pathways</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Each six transfer pathway test measure control , ventilate study chamber University Minnesota 's School Public Health Industrial Hygiene Laboratory . To test pathway , human volunteer perform repeat contact activity use identical protocol ( e.g. , identical number contact , type material contact , measured pressure contact , measure time contact , measure temperature humidity ) inter- intra-individual variability characterize . The qualitative quantitative sampling method use develop , test , publish researcher National Institute Occupational Safety Health ( NIOSH ) institution ASTM . Specifically , quantitative transfer efficiency measure use accept wipe sampling protocol take several paper peer-reviewed literature . Semi-quantitative transfer pattern measure use fluorescent tracer intensity technique also present peer-reviewed literature . The skin surface wipe sample send accredited American Industrial Hygiene Association ( AIHA ) laboratory analysis . These sample result allow investigator report measure quantitative dermal transfer efficiencies elemental metallic lead Tinopal pathway mass per square surface area skin , also calculate relative transfer efficiency term percent transfer versus originally load . Fluorescent tracer map allow investigator demonstrate pattern transfer pathway use intensity tracer follow transfer . Following analysis , investigator use data well inform relative importance pathway conceptual model respect dermal exposure assessment model effort . These result important improve quality workplace dermal exposure assessment technique . The current approach well validate , unknown result exist dermal exposure model accurate . It expect result study help improve protection worker certain dermal exposure hazard workplace provide good input exist dermal exposure model , since possible collect exposure sample job task workplace .</detailed_description>
