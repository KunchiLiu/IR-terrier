	<brief_summary>The late finding ergogenic effect dentistry-design , bite-aligning mouthpiece require additional research ass impact anaerobic ability ventilatory parameter . This study aim determine ergogenic acute effect wear custom-made mouthpiece oral airflow dynamic , Wingate Test performance parameter .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Jaw Clenching Anaerobic Ability Ventilatory Flows</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study investigate acute effect customize , bite-aligning mouthpiece different parameter assess Wingate Test , compare clench jaw without mouthpiece , physically-active , male population . The study also investigate influence wear mouthpiece non-forced force airflow dynamic , compare open mouth jaw clench without mouthpiece . Mouthpieces make use new scan method simplify fitting process lower cost . A nonrandomized study design compare effect occlusion condition anaerobic power airflow dynamic . Conditions wear wear mouthguard ( MOUTHG NO-MOUTHG , respectively ) randomly distribute test . Each subject participate three session . The first session use obtain informed consent ass anthropometric measurement scan subject 's mouth structure . In second session , subject familiarize test protocol via learn session include demonstration Wingate Test airflow dynamic measurement . Subjects also perform airflow test first Wingate Test trial . In third session , subject perform second Wingate Test trial . Conditions randomly distribute test . Wingate Test trial separate three day subject allow perform intensive training workload .</detailed_description>
