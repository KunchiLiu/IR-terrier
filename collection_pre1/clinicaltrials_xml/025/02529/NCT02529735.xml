	<brief_summary>Non-invasive measurement blood pressure instrument govern nursing routine care . The use automate oscillometric cuff common technique validate do arm suitable cuff , position opposite brachial artery right atrium ( brachial site ) . If cons-indication use brachial site , measurement frequently perform ankle , calf thigh . Among blood pressure value measure 3 site low limb ( thigh , calf ankle ) , may specific property observed value close reference value ( brachial ) . The objective study measure non-invasive blood pressure value three site low limb , compare reference value determine alternative site preferred reference measurement feasible . We want determine alternative site obtain value close measure value reference site . The three study site thigh , calf ankle . The reference site recommend monitoring non-invasive blood pressureis arm . It also assess impact certain parameter primary endpoint : - Physiological parameter : gender , weight , height , age , systolic blood pressure reference , list measure . - A parameter relate measurement : discomfort felt blood pressure outlet . - Exposure setting : smoking .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Primary Outcome : The difference systolic blood pressure , diastolic mean simultaneously measure arm three site low limb . Secondary endpoint : The difference systolic blood pressure , diastolic mean simultaneously measure arm three site low limb follow subgroup : - Male / Female - BMI &lt; 25 / BMI &gt; 25 - Size &lt; 160 cm / size [ 160-169 ] cm / size [ 170-180 ] cm / size [ 181-190 ] cm / size ≥ 191 cm - Age &lt; 25 year / age ≥ 25 year - Systolic Blood Pressure value ( SAP ) reference site &lt; 100 mmHg / 100 mmHg ≥ NOT value reference site &lt; 140 mmHg / ≥ 140 mmHg - Visual Analog Scale discomfort ≤ 4/10 / &gt; 4/10 - Hemibody study Right / Left - Smoking / No Smoking Discomfort level depend measurement site blood pressure general population . - Discomfort level measurement blood pressure site follow subgroup : - Male / Female - BMI &lt; 25 / BMI &gt; 25 - size &lt; 160 cm / size [ 160-169 ] cm / size [ 170 -180 ] cm / size [ 181-190 ] cm / size ≥ 191 cm - Age &lt; 25 / age ≥ 25 year - blood pressure value ( SAP ) reference site &lt; 100 mmHg / 100 mmHg ≥ NOT Value reference site &lt; 140 mmHg / ≥ 140 mmHg - hemibody study Right / Left - Smoking / No Smoking Methodology : Experimental design : This observational study , prospective , multicenter , comparative healthy volunteer , individual witness . Reports non-invasive blood pressure value 3 different site low limb , compare reference value . For individual , side carry blood pressure measurement draw . After 5 minute rest supine position , realize measurement blood pressure non-invasively systolic , mean diastolic 2 automate oscillometric measuring device identical calibrate simultaneously arm thigh ipsilateral / arm calf ipsilateral / arm ipsilateral ankle . Each measurement repeat 1 minute . Statistical analysis : Systolic , mean diastolic pressure analyze separately , express average standard deviation 95 % confidence interval . The concordance BP measurement arm three site low limb analyze method Bland Altman , calculate average difference , approval limit , well confidence interval 95 % upper low limit approval subject Gaussian distribution difference measurement . The search best AP measurement site low member make compare difference three site reference site , global test ( variance analysis test Friedmann accord distribution difference ) , comparison 2-2 adjust p-value . The chosen site one difference significantly weak . All test conduct bilaterally risk first specie set 5 % . In early study , large variance find regard difference systolic BP calf arm . Based pessimistic scenario ( = 12.76 ) highlight difference 5 mm Hg alpha risk 5 % power 90 % take account multiple comparison consider , 176 patient necessary . Given characteristic study , educational value part train clinical research nursing student , couple study medical visit firefighter , recruitment opportunity important . 7 Nursing Schools , 3 100 student average promotion , count 70 % nursing student 2 year , 1470 bring healthy volunteer . The Departmental Fire Rescue Fire Brigade Paris potentially bring respectively 1,500 3,000 healthy volunteer per year . To extent increase workforce generate additional cost , investigator want include 1,000 woman among Nursing Schools student 1,000 men among firefighter . Total duration study : 36 month Period inclusion : 24 month Duration participation voluntary : 30 minute Number participate center : 9 center</detailed_description>
