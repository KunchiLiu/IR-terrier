	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND AND INTRODUCTION : Atrial fibrillation ( AF ) common cardiac arrhythmia affect million people US around world . Treating AF continue challenge . Over last 15 year , catheter base AF ablation procedure widely adopt . Approximately 50 % patient treated catheter ablation present persistent type arrhythmia . Unfortunately , ablation result population dismal , low success rate suppress arrhythmia , also healthcare cost point view . In fact , long-term success procedure report low 20 % , patient may need two ablation procedure achieve temporary arrhythmia suppression . The cost AF ablation among Medicare patient follow year ablation find US $ 16,049 ± 12,536 ablation successful versus US $ 19,997 ± 13,958 fail ablation . A major issue contribute low success catheter ablation lack protocol appropriately select patient would respond treatment . Currently , cardiologists base decision ablate persistent AF various comorbidities , concept proven successful . With introduction AF ablation first line therapy option recent guideline , good accurate selection protocol urgently need . There strong association AF atrial tissue fibrosis . Recently , novel DE-MRI ( Delayed-Enhancement MRI ) base image modality demonstrate reveal degree fibrotic atrial tissue patient suffer AF . When apply various study , include multicenter study , extent fibrotic atrial change show strong independent predictor successful treatment patient undergoing ablation AF . Moreover , multicenter observational study DE-MRI Determinant Successful Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation Atrial Fibrillation ( DECAAF ) , strong independent predictor successful outcome surface area fibrosis cover ablation lesion . In fact , number encircle pulmonary vein , common adopt approach ablate AF today , predict catheter ablation success . The use non-invasive ambulatory electrocardiography ( ECG ) device include 24-48 hour Holter monitor 30-day cardiac event monitor widely use detection cardiac rhythm abnormality . The duration time rhythm evaluation key detect arrhythmias conduction abnormality , number arrhythmia diagnose increase increase duration monitoring . The long duration monitoring occur expense patient comfort patient compliance . Previous FDA- approve device standard care monitoring limited duration monitoring . At many institution , standard care wear 60-day cardiac event monitor detection evaluation cardiac arrhythmias post-ablation blanking period . The percentage asymptomatic recurrence AF drastically increase ablation . Thus , post-procedure device necessary close monitor detection asymptomatic AF ablation patient . Compliance current cardiac event monitor may low many reason . Electrode intolerance due skin rash , irritation and/or breakdown , unwillingness continuous device wear know area non-compliance . A high level monitoring provide use new wireless ECG technology , specifically , FDA approve ECG Check mobile heart monitor design Cardiac Designs . This mobile heart monitor enable patient record heart rhythm anytime anywhere . The device automatically analyze ECG symptomatic asymptomatic arrhythmia duration life long compatible current `` smart phone '' tablet computer . This patient-owned monitor . The ECG Check first FDA-approved over-the-counter ECG monitor currently compatible approve smart phone . This allow patient record , store , transfer analyze single-channel ECG wirelessly ECG Check app ECG Check Web Center . The information upload protect server Cardiac Designs . DESIGN : DECAAF II prospective , randomize , multicenter trial patient persistent AF presence atrial fibrosis . After consent participate study , subject undergo DE-MRI scan ass extent atrial fibrosis . Consented patient randomize one two study group receive conventional PVI ablation ( Group 1 ) PVI + fibrosis-guided ablation ( Group 2 ) . In Group 1 , PVI ablation perform recommended Heart Rhythm Society ( HRS ) consensus statement physician blind pre-ablation MRI fibrosis result . In Group 2 , physician receive DE-MRI scan prior ablation procedure complete conventional PV isolation target leave atrial fibrosis detect MRI ablation procedure . Once randomize , follow-up period patient extend 18 month follow patient 's ablation procedure common administrative censoring date 12 month ablation procedure final randomized subject , whichever come first . If randomize patient fail undergo ablation , patient follow 18 month patient 's randomization date 12 month last patient randomize , whichever come first . This event-driven trial , patient enrollment follow-up continue approximately 517 randomized subject experience primary endpoint AA recurrence . Under assumption describe analysis section , anticipate 888 subject randomize , include 444 assigned Group 1 444 assign Group 2 . The actual number enrol duration follow-up period adjust necessary achieve 517 required event . STUDY PROCEDURES Recruitment Clinical Center staff approach potentially eligible patient participate study . The de-identified characteristic refuse participate collect ascertain selection bias would limit applicability result . Consent If patient meet eligibility criterion , Clinical Center investigator delegate study staff approach patient explain study obtain informed consent subject participate . The investigator designated staff provide explanation study procedures benefit risk , cost compensation involve study . Participants give sufficient time read consent form individual obtaining informed consent answer question pose participant . Imaging Protocol All patient undergo DE-MRI within 30 day prior ablation procedure use Marrek DE-MRI protocol ( MRI sequence Image processing software ) . The purpose initial MRI quantify degree atrial structural remodel fibrosis prior ablation . If patient heart rate ≥ 90 beat per minute , pre-medicated beta blocker prior MRI order obtain optimal image . Images send Marrek Inc. , ( Salt Lake City , UT ) review quality train technician use standard protocol . Images meet quality standard process . The site physician may opt repeat MRI scan re-submit evaluation . If image meet quality standard process , Marrek verify subject proportion atrial fibrosis ( limited advance stage fibrosis ) . Utah Stages 1-4 use classify patient base percent fibrosis . Subjects image successfully evaluate scored fibrosis randomize . Following ablation , DE-MRIs obtain 90 day follow detect quantify ablation-related scar formation . Randomization After image process scored fibrosis , Data Coordinating Center ( DCC ) staff complete randomization procedure use web-based randomization service . Randomization stratify Clinical Center Utah Stage ( two Utah stage stratum define Utah stage I - II Utah stag III - IV ) . For subject randomize fibrosis-guided ablation arm ( Group 2 ) , DCC make processed image available investigator Clinical Center use ablation procedure . Processed fibrosis image subject randomize PVI ablation group ( Group 1 ) make available clinician site staff . All image retain Marrek site storage later analysis . Clinical investigator schedule ablation procedure occur within approximately 30 day image complete . The study outcome formally define least two consecutive , valid ECG tracing indicate atrial arrhythmia ( AA ) ( atrial fibrillation , atrial flutter atrial tachycardia ) . Both tracing must complete 90-day blanking period . The two consecutive tracing demonstrate atrial arrhythmia must record 6 hour 7 day . If ECG Check trace demonstrate non-self-terminating bout atrial arrhythmia ( AA ) , DCC system send notification Clinical Center indicate atrial arrhythmia observe . If second , consecutive ECG Check reading also demonstrate atrial arrhythmia 6 hour 7 day first record , DCC system notify Clinical Center . In case 12-lead ECG , obtain clinical reason , first demonstrate atrial arrhythmia , subsequent , consecutive , valid ECG reading also confirmatory meet study outcome . The 12-lead ECG data transmit DCC inclusion study database . This ECG transmit central location review ; rather 12-lead obtain association study outcome read independent expert verify presence AA . This expert blind study arm . In possible scenario second ablation perform 90-day blanking period , recurrence demonstrate either ECG measure ( 12 lead ECG Check ) , AA recurrence infer assigned date second ablation . Devices utilized trial In trial , 3 different U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve device utilize . The first hand-held ECG application transmits ECG . This device approve transmittal ECG information . The second software application view post-processing cardiovascular MRIs obtain left atrial enhancement quantification visualization 3D model , previously approve indication . Finally , ablation catheter use atrial fibrillation treatment use approve manner . Although trial first use 3 device together , use necessitate new IDE composite utilization fall within current approval device approve indication . Study Endpoints The primary endpoint study recurrence atrial arrhythmia post-ablation , define non-self-terminating bout atrial fibrillation , atrial flutter , atrial tachycardia demonstrate least two consecutive , valid ECG tracing occur within 6 hour maximum 7 day 90-day post-ablation blanking period . The primary endpoint determine tracing ECG Check mobile device clinically obtain 12-lead ECG indicate persistent atrial arrhythmia . The clinically obtain 12-lead ECG option use subject unwilling unable continue use ECG check device . It difficult anticipate whether subject population technical difficulty accessibility issue use smart phone tablet device daily basis ; 12-lead ECG option gear offer option unable continue use device . If subject undergoes second ablation procedure study period ( 90-day blanking period ) document atrial arrhythmia method describe previously , ablation also constitute study endpoint . Ablations occur within 90 day blank period count outcome . Project Enrollment Follow-up Timeline : This 3-year study approximately 9 month allot develop material , Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approval , startup activity , roll patient enrollment , approximately 12 month follow-up last patient randomize , 6 month close-out activity manuscript preparation .
