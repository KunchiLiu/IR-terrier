	<brief_summary>The mainstay treatment reduce symptom angina long-term risk heart attack patient heart disease stent implantation diseased coronary artery . Whilst procedure revolutionise treatment incidence secondary event remain concern . These repeat event due part continue enhanced platelet reactivity , endothelial dysfunction phenomenon call 'restenosis ' i.e . stent becomes block ultimately require another expensive risky procedure . In study determine whether daily inorganic nitrate administration might favourably modulate platelet reactivity endothelial function lead decrease restenosis .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Investigating Effects Dietary Nitrate Vascular Function , Platelet Reactivity Restenosis Stable Angina</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To address aim proof-of-concept study conduct ascertain whether dietary nitrate approach might prove useful adjunctive therapy improve vascular function patient stable angina post elective angioplasty . Design : A prospective randomise , single-centre , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial Setting : Patients stable angina single/multiple coronary artery stenosis undergo elective percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) haemodynamically stable ( systolic BP &gt; 100 mmHg ) . These patient recruit The Barts Health Heart Centre , base St. Bartholomew 's Hospital . This one big centre United Kingdom , serve population almost two million people The City London The North East M25 24/7 centre perform approximately 2000 non-primary angioplasty year . The study take place Clinical Trials Unit , William Harvey Heart Centre . Target population : A total 246 patient ( male female , age 18-85 ) stable angina per requirement indicate . Follow-up take place Clinical Trials Unit , William Harvey Research Institute . Treatment : Patients randomise ( use line randomisation database ) receive 70 ml beetroot juice concentrate contain 4-5 mmol nitrate nitrate-deplete placebo juice concentrate . This intervention take patient daily one day prior re-establishment flow PCI stent implantation . Analysis : We analyse result base intention treat analysis . We also carry per protocol analysis subgroup analysis patient organic nitrate part routine therapy comparison DES ( drug-eluting stent ) versus BMS ( bare-metal stent ) .</detailed_description>
