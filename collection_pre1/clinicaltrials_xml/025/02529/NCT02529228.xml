	<detailed_description>Cardio-Metabolic Disease ( CMD ) lead cause death globally &amp; Singapore . Large scale epidemiological evidence confirm elevated postprandial Glucose , Insulin , Triglycerides major risk factor CMD . Recent evidence suggest benefit high protein diet health effect eat small meal remain enigmatic . The aim study examine Meal frequency ( 2-large v 6-smaller isocaloric meal ) , High Low Protein load acute postprandial health biomarkers . The investigator hypothesize Higher Protein &amp; Higher Meal Frequency would beneficial cardiometabolic health .</detailed_description>
