	<brief_summary>IgA nephropathy ( IgAN ) prevalent primary glomerular disease worldwide important cause end stage renal disease . IgAN incidence 8-25 new cases/year/per million age-related population adult 3-5/new cases/year/per million age-related population child progress need renal replacement treatment 5-15 % 10 year 20 % 20 year . The variability clinical course anticipate different treatment option . There absolute need validate biomarkers predict risk progression indication treatment early stage , lesion reversible . This study aim evaluate IgAN progression histological clinical correlate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>IgA nephropathy prevalent primary glomerular disease worldwide important cause end stage renal disease . Clinical course varies long term stable renal function minimal proteinuria microscopic hematuria rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis crescent renal biopsy progress end stage renal disease short time . In current practice diagnosis make renal biopsy . A less invasive procedure diagnosis present serum biomarkers clinical follow-up , treatment response prognosis available . For reason follow-up disease enable indirect marker renal function like proteinuria , serum creatinine glomerular filtration rate . These marker specific IgA nephropathy . The lack disease specific marker hinders standardization patient follow-up treatment . Development specific sensitive , repeatable , histopathological clinical marker diagnosis , follow treatment response IgA nephropathy prevalent primary glomerular disease affect many patient worldwide offer prospect diagnosis improve prognostication .</detailed_description>
