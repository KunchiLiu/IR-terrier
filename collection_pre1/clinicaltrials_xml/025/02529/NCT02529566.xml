	<brief_summary>Investigate potential tissue graft include human mesenchymal stem cell repair potential stabilization degenerative Lumbar disk facet joint denovo time surgical reconstruction . Our hypothesis propose stabilization help restore normal structure function degenerative lumbar spine may decrease chronic low back pain associated biomechanical demise degenerative disk facet may improve natural history adjacent segment disease find spinal surgery .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Human Autograft Mesenchymal Stem Cell Mediated Stabilization The Degenerative Lumbar Spine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study prospective cohort clinical study , tissue graft contain nucleated adult derive autologous allograft mesenchymal stem cell deliver via intra-discal intra-facet injection subject chronic low back pain due either lumbar degenerative disk disease degenerative facet disease one five lumbar level L1 S1 patient unresponsive conservative therapy . A second cohort evaluate development adjacent segment disease lumbar disk facet joint nucleate adult mesenchymal stem cell deliver via intra-discal intra-facet injection surgical treatment adjacent level degenerative pathology spine . Traditionally , treatment degenerative spinal condition focus reconstruction damage tissue within motion segment spine . However , biologic treatment degenerate spinal component address etiology disease process oppose react symptomatology . Strategies induce reparative response within disk facet joint focus rebuild chondrocyte population induce production healthy biomechanical extracellular matrix.. Current model induce reparative response include ; injection proteins stimulate proteoglycan production inhibit inflammatory response ; transfer genetic material cell within dammed structure ; engineering newly form tissue ex-vivo implantation ; finally repopulation damage tissue cell repair injured structure . Subjects meet strict inclusion/exclusion criterion enrol study injection allograft autologous tissue graft include mesenchymal stem cell degenerative lumbar spine follow minimum 2 year efficacy adverse event . This prospective clinical study cohort compare allograft autograft cellular tissue graft injection subject chronic low back pain due either lumbar degenerative disk disease degenerative facet disease one five lumbar level L1 S1 patient unresponsive conservative therapy least 3 months.Pre-treatment image criterion include Pfirmann Lumbar disk Scores and/or Fujiwara Facet Joint Scores note screen visit . After screen treatment visit , subject evaluate 2 week , 6 week , 3 , 6 , 12 , 24 month injection . MRI scan perform 6 month post-procedure visit Pfirmann Fujiwara Scores calculate along notation adjacent level disease , epidural pathology ( i.e . new disk herniation ) , new image finding . Patients give informed consent participate individual treatment receive . This informed consent follow US FDA guideline detail ICH E6 Section 4.8 US Department Health Human Services Center Drug/Biologics Evaluation Research . At completion enrollment patient surgical sterile preparation drape . All JCAHO Surgical Care Improvement Project protocols include pre-operative antibiotic adhere . The disk facet joint interest verify fluoroscopy sterilely cannulate 21 11G needle base anatomic requirement . At point injection FDA approve allograft autograft mesenchymal stem cell within demineralize bone matrix hyalouronic acid carrier respectively inject facet joint disk space . Needle remove sterile dressing place . Patients place post operative brace stabilization index level aid healing . Patients discharge home standard outpatient discharge criterion meet per JCAHO guideline . Follow period adhere noted . Patient safety strictly monitor pre-procedure , peri-procedure , post-procedure period minimum 2 year . All patient assign follow surgeon specific follow period patient deny care period . Physical examination document visit . Additionally , schedule image study perform throughout study period follow safety . Patients follow surgical investigator , responsible diagnosis management complication adverse event . Development additional non-spinal disease process also document follow trend occur include new related un-related disease . Safety patient confidentiality additional study relate risk , optimize full adhere US Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act 1996 ( HIPAA ) . Any Serious Adverse Events ( SAE ) define US FDA report immediately IRB evaluation . A SAE classified adverse event result hospital admission hospital stay , alteration body permanent way . Surgeon investigator provide pre-operative , peri-operative , post-operative care subject . Pre-operative , peri-operative , post operative data collect . Patients follow minimum 2 year within US Canada study investigator data collection 2 week ( ±1 wk ) , 6 week ( ±2 wks ) , 3 month ( ±2 wks ) , 6 month ( ±1 mo ) , 9 month ( ± 1.5 month ) , 12 month ( ±2 mo ) , 24 month ( ±2 mo ) . Data may enter additional time point need . Re-admission , re-injection , additional hospital/outpatient event collect include possible additional surgical procedure . Data manage investigator designee computerized database accessible research staff original information keep patient medical record hospital follow sub-investigator office . Comparative statistical analysis perform prior publication validate data conclusion . Study staff Principle Investigator ( PI ) agree conduct study ( y ) accordance relevant , current protocol ( ) make change protocol notify sponsor , except necessary protect safety , right , welfare subject . The PI agree personally conduct supervise describe investigation ( ) . The PI agree inform patient , person use control , drug device use investigational purpose PI ensure requirement relate obtain informed consent US 21 CFR Part 50 institutional review board ( IRB ) review approval US 21 CFR Part 56 met . The PI agree report sponsor adverse experience occur course investigation ( ) accordance US 21 CFR 312.64 . The PI understand potential risk side effect treatment , investigational standard care . The PI agree ensure associate , colleague , employee assist conduct study ( y ) inform obligation meet commitment . The PI agree maintain adequate accurate record accordance US 21 CFR 312.62 make record available inspection accordance US 21 CFR 312.68 study apply accepted US FDA review . The PI ensure IRB complies requirement US 21 CFR Part 56 responsible initial continue review approval clinical investigation . The PI also agree promptly report IRB change research activity unanticipated problem involve risk human subject others . Additionally , PI make change research without IRB approval , except necessary eliminate apparent immediate hazard human subject . The PI agree comply requirement regard obligation clinical investigator pertinent requirement US 21 CFR Part 312 . Medical Ethics primary importance study expose humans new treatment . The scientific merit study protocol , potential social value research , skill experience investigator , potential financial exploitation study subject paramount concern . Thus , addition abide US FDA Quality Assurance Policy ( Form 1572 ) , World Health Organization 's `` Declaration Helsinki '' involve Ethical Principles Medical Research Involving Human Subjects abide throughout trial . Finally , study involve subject reside within United States , investigator trial also abide Title 45 Part 46 Code [ US ] Federal Regulations , Protection Human Subjects ( 45 CFR 46 ) .</detailed_description>
