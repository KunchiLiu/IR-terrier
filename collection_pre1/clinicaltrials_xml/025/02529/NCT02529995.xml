To obtain preliminary assessment anti-tumour activity AZD9291 evaluation tumour response use Response Evaluation Criteria Solid Tumours ( RECIST ) version 1.1 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase I , Study Chinese NSCLC Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I , open-label , two part ( Part A Part B ) study determine pharmacokinetics AZD9291 administer orally two dose level ( 40 mg 80 mg ) patient locally advance metastatic NSCLC progress follow prior therapy approve EGFR TKI agent ( +/- additional chemotherapy regimen ) . Approximately 24 patient enter study , 12 patient dose level . - Cohort 1 investigate pharmacokinetics single multiple dose AZD9291 40 mg daily dose . - Cohort 2 investigate pharmacokinetics single multiple dose AZD9291 80 mg daily dose . The enrollment Cohort 2 start Cohort 1 finish enrollment . The first 12 patient enrol study 40 mg dose Cohort . Patients administer single dose AZD9291 Day 1 , Cycle 0 begin Part A period . From Day 2 Day 6 , treatment give , PK sample obtain ; Day 7 ( Cycle1 , Day1 ) , patient administer AZD9291 daily continuous schedule , ie , break AZD9291 dose . Part A complete Cycle 4 treatment Part B start without treatment interruption . Patients cohort continue treatment AZD9291 treatment discontinuation criterion meet . There maximum duration treatment patient may continue receive AZD9291 beyond RECIST 1.1 define progression long continue receive clinical benefit , judge investigator . The whole study divide nominally two part : Part A ass pharmacokinetics preliminary efficacy safety AZD9291 40 mg 80 mg respectively , Part B ass safety efficacy data AZD9291 . Following completion Part A , patient automatically continue Part B .</detailed_description>
