	<brief_summary>Due remarkable advance cancer treatment , investigator witness grow population long-term survivor childhood malignancy . However , fertility adult life may severely impair gonadotoxic therapy . Since prepubertal boy produce spermatozoon , bank testicular tissue prior gonadotoxic treatment crucial step towards fertility preservation population . Several center around world cryopreserving testicular tissue prepubertal boy anticipation future technology allow utilization bank sample fertility restoration . Testicular tissue cryopreservation emerge lead strategy fertility preservation prepubertal boy gonadotoxic treatment .

	<brief_title>Fertility Preservation Prepubertal Boys : An Experimental Approach</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As treatment regimens pediatric oncologic malignancy improve , survivor enter reproductive year . Since gonadal damage relatively common unfortunate consequence treatment use cure pediatric cancer well certain hematological condition immunodeficiency , maintenance fertility extremely important regard long-term quality life survivor . Consideration must give whether child 's fertility likely impacted treatment . Ideally , occur start therapy , window opportunity may exist preserve patient 's future reproductive potential . Developments area sperm bank reproductive technology make possible offer viable option preserve fertility pubertal male undergo cancer therapy . Pubertal male produce semen sample prior start gonadotoxic therapy cryopreserve sperm future use . Because current method oocyte fertilization utilize one motile sperm , method proven successful even number sperm , frozen , small . Unfortunately , prepubertal male pose particular challenge fertility preservation . These boy produce semen cryopreservation masturbation . They also mature spermatozoa . Although prepubertal testis produce mature spermatozoon , contain diploid stem-germ cell haploid spermatozoon derive . For risk prepubertal boy , well pubertal boy may able sperm bank , recent encourage approach use cryopreserved testicular tissue . While important stride make animal research area , use testicular tissue cryopreservation human remain experimental . If prepubertal testicular tissue could acquire bank start gonadotoxic therapy , tissue could thaw stored germ cell reimplanted patient 's testis , procedure know germ-cell transplantation . Alternatively , store cell could mature vitro achieve fertilization use intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) . Research animal model demonstrate several method use germ cell obtain mature spermatozoa fertilization include autotransplantation , xenotransplantation . Autotransplantation consider acceptable xenotransplantation , although successful mouse model . In rodent , autotransplantation result restored spermatogenesis mouse reproduce vivo . Investigators demonstrate microinjecting crude suspension germ cell mice render sterile restore spermatogenesis fertility . Similar success report rat large mammal . Restoration spermatogenesis also possible cryopreserved cell . It estimate 70 % spermatogonial cell survive freeze thaw . Malignant contamination remain one main concern surround transplantation , though study address issue controversial finding . Progress address question make mouse model , particularly use fluorescence-activated cell sort negatively sort malignant cell cell suspension . Because cryopreservation transplantation SSCs currently successful animal , application human seem likely near future . The possibility infertility issue many family need grapple agree initiate chemotherapy son . Since method require testicular biopsy , parental desire acceptability SSC collection important ass . Recently , researcher interview 318 parent regard acceptance idea . They ask parent think hypothetically follow scenario , `` If experimental procedure available diagnosis , would allow son undergo testicular biopsy attempt collect SSCs ? '' At diagnosis , SSC collection mean testicular biopsy theoretically approve 61 % parent . They also observe desire cryopreserve SSCs relate potential harmfulness oncological treatment , indicate even minor chance infertility consider major burden respect ultimate quality life . These data indicate translation current animal experiment SSC collection transplantation clinical care desire parent prepubertal boys cancer . This novel , experimental protocol require collaboration clinician basic scientist . There several key clinical translational point consider , include belief concern parent prepubertal boy cancer , ability perform testicular biopsy adequately without negative sequela , well tissue storage fertility research purpose , notably viability biopsy sample downstream vitro functional genomics study . The goal present proposal develop clinical , translational , basic science initiative allow extensive , dedicated program acquisition storage testicular tissue prepubertal male see Hadassah Medical center well collaborate institution Israel across world . Developing mean tissue distribution handle well long-term tissue storage critical component , especially since testicular tissue might decades storage prior use fertility set . Most importantly , cryopreservation protocol human testicular tissue develop de novo initiative ultimately become standard option fertility preservation prepubertal male cancer well blood disease immunodeficiency undergo stem cell transplant . An open testicular biopsy perform attend urologist ( effort make perform procedure concurrently procedure patient general anesthesia another purpose , i.e . central line placement , bone marrow aspirates/biopsies ) . This procedure occur gonadotoxic therapy initiate . Nevertheless , case emergent chemotherapy treatment , procedure may do chemotherapy since toxicity testicular stem cell know . A 10 mm incision make superior pole testis approximately 5 % portion extrude seminiferous tubule excise ( 2 mm x 4 mm x 10 mm ; approximately 1 gram tissue ) . This size normal testis biopsy do clinical reason evaluation cancer . In infant young boy size incision biopsy discretion urologist . Testicular biopsy specimen divide immediately operate table . Two third specimen ( term Specimen # 1 ) cryopreserved Sperm Wash Media potential use patient later date . A freezing protocol ( slow freezing ) currently place adult human testicular tissue cryopreservation implement current proposal , publish literature use prepubertal testicular tissue . Specifically , 0.7 M dimethyl sulfoxide ( DMSO ) use cryoprotective agent . Specimen # 1 biopsy patient 's name , date birth , current date , medical record number attach . A separate sheet also send specimen include phone number current address . These specimen stay sperm bank Hadassah Medical Center . As stated , third specimen use research purpose effort advance science isolate culture human SSCs fertility research . These portion strip personal health identifier time division unique identify code assign . The risk study pertain testicular biopsy . The side effect procedure mild . Pain related procedure expect easily control mild moderate analgesic medication . The benefit patient may able use frozen testicular biopsy tissue and/or culture SSC 's derive biopsy preserve fertility future . At time , however , imperative note procedure purely experimental . The time frame study define date recruitment date clinical utilization cryopreserved tissue fertility restoration forty year . We collect adverse outcome , occur ( intra-operatively ) testicular biopsy include pain , bleed and/or infection . Events track record one week procedure , time frame well beyond 2-3 day recovery time associate type biopsy . Events clearly relate subject 's cancer cancer treatment specifically testicular biopsy collected/reported .</detailed_description>
