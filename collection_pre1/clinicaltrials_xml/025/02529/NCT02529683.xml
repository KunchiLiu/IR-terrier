	<brief_title>Study Nuvaring Acceptability , Adherence Biological Effects Among HIV-negative Women Kenya</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Adherence HIV prevention contraception technology imperfect key effectiveness . The option currently available protect woman HIV infection unwanted pregnancy ( e. g. condom use , abstinence , monogamy ) consistently available , practical , woman 's control . Intravaginal ring ( IVRs ) important technology long-acting woman-controlled develop HIV prevention without co-formulated hormonal contraception . Availability IVRs sub-Saharan Africa limit ; hence , important evaluate acceptability , utilization , biologic effect IVR usage among African woman . The NuvaRing® intravaginal combine hormonal contraceptive ring use successfully 61 country worldwide , although currently Kenya . NuvaRing self-inserted 21 day start last day menses remove seven day allow menses occur , comparable effectiveness oral contraceptive . Adherence HIV prevention contraception technology like IVR critical optimizing effectiveness . In preparation potential future Phase 2 trial combination antiretroviral-contraceptive IVR , KEMRI/CDC propose examine adherence , acceptability biological effect NuvaRing® among Kenyan woman already use modern method contraception . Objectives : 1 . To assess adherence utilization pattern NuvaRing® , behaviourally biologically . 2 . To assess acceptability effect NuvaRing® sexual behaviour among woman sexual partner set routine IVR use . At end NuvaRing® trial , additionally assess hypothetical acceptability prototype dual use HIV-prevention contraceptive IVR among woman use NuvaRing® among woman never use IVR . 3 . To assess biologic effect NuvaRing® include standard safety monitoring , among subset participant , genital compartment immunology microbiology . Study Subjects : A total 220 woman 20 men enrol different part propose study . The primary NuvaRing® trial participant ( Objectives 1 2 ) 200 young , healthy woman recruit family planning clinic Kisumu catchment area . Fifty woman form biomedical subgroup address Objective 3 . To augment Objective 2 , twenty trial participant sexual partner take part qualitative in-depth interview , three focus group discussion conduct , one study participants others 20 woman part primary NuvaRing® trial . Design : Single arm clinical trial 3 month pre-product phase ( oral injectable contraceptive ) follow 6 month IVR use , end 3 month post-product phase woman return oral injectable contraceptive exit study . Monthly quarterly follow-up include adherence , acceptability clinical assessment , HIV pregnancy test . Women biomedical subgroup undergo frequent visit collection genital specimen . In-depth interview focus group discussion delineate 'Study Subjects ' . Outcome : The study improve understand adherence biomedical technology , facilitate conduct future HIV microbicide clinical trial rely IVR technology , inform public health practice regard contraception .</detailed_description>
