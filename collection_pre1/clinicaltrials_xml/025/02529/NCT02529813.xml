	<brief_summary>Sometimes researcher change DNA ( genetic material cell ) donate T-cells ( white blood cell support immune system ) use process call `` gene transfer . '' Gene transfer involve draw blood patient , separate T-cells use machine . Researchers perform gene transfer change T-cells ' DNA , inject change T-cells body patient . The goal clinical research study find high tolerable dose genetically change T-cells give patient . Researchers want learn genetically change T-cells may able attack cancer cell patient advance B-cell lymphoma leukemia .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Groups : If find eligible take part study , assign Dose Level genetically change T-cells base begin receive cell product . Up 4 dose level T-cells test . Up 3 participant enrol dose level . The first group participant receive low dose level . Each new group receive high dose group , intolerable side effect see . This continue high tolerable dose T-cells found . It take 7 week modify grow necessary number genetically change T-cells lab . T Cell Collection Treatment Arm 1 : Within 30 day T-cell collection : - You physical exam . - You chest x-ray . - You electrocardiogram ( EKG ) check heart function . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Part blood sample used pregnancy test able become pregnant . To take part study , must pregnant . - HIV blood test . State law require result positive test HIV report local health agency . - Mouse protein antibody use gene transfer process . If body become immune protein , body may develop antibody mouse antibody ( call `` human anti-mouse antibody '' HAMA ) . Part blood sample use compare another sample blood collect gene transfer complete check HAMA . Within 30 day complete screening test , may leukapheresis perform Apheresis Clinic MD Anderson . Before leukapheresis : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test measure level certain protein . If leukapheresis perform collect T-cells , study doctor discuss procedure detail ask sign separate consent . If doctor think best interest , instead leukapheresis , blood ( 13Â½ tablespoon ) draw collect white blood cell . If enough T cell collect , leukapheresis blood draw collect white blood cell may repeat . Chemotherapy : Before receive T cell infusion , may receive standard chemotherapy ( cyclophosphamide without fludarabine ) vein . The goal chemotherapy help infuse T-cells work well . If doctor think best interest , may receive chemotherapy . Your doctor make decision , sign separate consent chemotherapy explain drug risk . Study Visits Before T-cell Infusion : Within 60 day T-cell infusion : - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw check status disease . - You echocardiogram ( ECHO ) multigated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan check heart function . - You lung function test . - If study doctor think need , bone marrow biopsy/aspiration check status disease . To collect bone marrow biopsy/aspirate , area hip chest bone numb anesthetic , small amount bone bone marrow withdrawn large needle . - If study doctor think need , lumbar puncture check status disease . To perform lumbar puncture ( also call spinal tap ) , special needle insert low back space bone . The needle use withdraw sample fluid surround spinal cord . - If study doctor think need , compute tomography ( CT ) scan and/or positron emission tomography ( PET ) scan check status disease . Within 7 day start chemotherapy ( receive ) : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . Part blood sample used pregnancy test able become pregnant . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) drawn learn body 's immune system respond T-cell infusion . T-cell Infusion : The T-cell infusion give vein 15-30 minute either one day split two day . It give 1 month last chemotherapy treatment . Before infusion , receive drug low risk allergic reaction T-cells . Tylenol ( acetaminophen ) give mouth Benadryl ( diphenhydramine ) may give mouth vein minute . Study Tests After T cell infusion : Within 3 day , 1 week ( +/- 2 day ) , 2 week ( +/- 3 day ) , 1 month ( +/- 7 day ) , 3 month ( +/- 7 day ) , 6 month ( +/- 14 day ) , 12 month ( +/- 14 day ) T-cell infusion , follow test procedure perform : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) draw routine test , test measure level certain protein , test check status disease . Part blood sample use compare sample blood collect gene transfer check HAMA ( 6 month T-cell infusion ) . If leave study early study doctor think possible , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw HAMA test time . - Blood ( 4 tablespoon ) drawn learn body 's immune system respond T-cell infusion ( 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month timepoints ) . - Within 60 day T-cell infusion test do test lung function ( PFT 's ) . At around 1 , 3 , 6 , 12 month last T-cell infusion , study doctor think need , CT scan and/or bone marrow biopsy check status disease . Length Study : Your participation study complete last planned study visit 12 month last T-cell infusion complete . You may take study early disease get bad , keep appointment , doctor think best interest , cell manufacture collect , unable receive T-cell infusion ( ) . Long-Term Follow-Up Study : For safety reason , U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) require patient receive stem cell infusion treat gene transfer procedure must long-term follow-up least 15 year receive gene transfer . You ask sign separate consent form long-term follow-up study ( Protocol 2006-0676 ) . In event death due cause , autopsy request family possible . This investigational study . The T-cell infusion use gene transfer procedure commercially available FDA approve . At time , T-cell infusion use gene transfer procedure use research . Up 30 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
