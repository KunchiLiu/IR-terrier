	<brief_title>Endo-cuff Assisted Vs. Standard Colonoscopy Polyp Detection Bowel Cancer Screening</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Problem statement : In England , everyone age group 60-69 year invited participate bowel cancer screening . Those test positive initial screen stool test invite colonoscopy . The purpose colonoscopy detect obvious cancer , absence obvious cancer purpose detect remove polyps present colon , polyps potential develop cancer . However , colonoscopy still miss 25 % polyp . Cap assist colonoscopy improves polyp detection still miss significant number polyp . There need improved cap design help improve polyp detection . Research question/hypothesis : Does use endocuff colonoscope improve polyp detection compare standard colonoscopy bowel cancer screen patient ? Study design : Parallel group , single blind randomise control trial Study participant : Patients attend colonoscopy bowel cancer screen programme Planned sample size : 534 Planned study period : 12 month Primary objective : To assess impact endocuff assist colonoscopy number polyp detect per patient</detailed_description>
