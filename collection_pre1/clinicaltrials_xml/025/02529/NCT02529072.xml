	<brief_summary>Patients randomize one two treatment arm - Group I Group II . Group I receive nivolumab monotherapy surgical resection , Group II receive nivolumab alone DC vaccine therapy surgical resection . During surgical resection blood tumor sample assess compare . Following surgery , group continue receive DC vaccine ( total 8 ) nivolumab therapy confirm progression .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nivolumab With DC Vaccines Recurrent Brain Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This two-arm randomized trial evaluate safety nivolumab combination DC vaccination treatment bevacizumab-naïve subject first second recurrent , resectable World Health Organization ( WHO ) Grade III IV malignant glioma ( MGs ) . Up 66 patient enrol treated goal accrue 30 patient ( 15 per arm ) receive nivolumab least 3 vaccine . After enrollment , leukapheresis do generation DC vaccines immunologic monitoring . All subject undergo standard care tetanus booster vaccination 0.5 mL Td ( tetanus diphtheria toxoid adsorb ) intramuscularly ( I.M . ) deltoid muscle ensure adequate immunity tetanus antigen . Subjects initially return every 2 week receive approximately 3 infusion nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV DC vaccine prepare initial leukapheresis randomize 1:1 one 2 arm ( Group I : nivolumab pre-surgery ; Group II : nivolumab DC vaccine pre-surgery ) . Patients unable tolerate nivolumab withdraw study replace . Patients whose DCs Peripheral Blood Lymphocytes ( PBLs ) fail meet release criterion continue receive nivolumab undergo repeat leukapheresis . For patient whose leukapheresis yield le 4 vaccine , repeat leukapheresis may obtain minimum 2 week previous leukapheresis ( may repeat need ) stable . Peripheral blood drawn immune monitoring prior treatment 4th cycle nivolumab ( first post-randomization infusion nivolumab ) . Group I Treatment Plan ( Nivolumab Only Pre-Surgery ) After randomization , patient Group I receive nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV every 2 week x approximately 8 week . The subject undergo surgical resection tumor within approximately 1-3 week . Approximately 2-4 week later , leukapheresis repeat generation DC vaccines immunologic monitoring . Approximately 1 day 2 week leukapheresis , subject resume nivolumab 3mg/kg IV every two week DC vaccine administration intradermally ( i.d . ) total 3 vaccine . At time third DC vaccine , patient receive vaccine site pre-conditioning . A single dose Td toxoid ( 1 flocculation unit ( Lf ) 0.4 milliliter ( mL ) saline ) administer single side groin i.d . ( described vaccine administration 12-24 hour prior third DC vaccine , always give bilaterally groin site . At vaccine # 3 visit , prior vaccine # 3 administration , erythema induration measurement take pre-conditioning site . Group I subject receive monthly DC vaccine administration intradermally 5 month progression ( whichever come first ) .Total vaccine administer 8 post-surgery unless subject remove . Nivolumab continue progression . At clinic visit follow last vaccine ( # 8 ) , subject peripheral blood drawn immune monitoring prior infusion nivolumab . Group II Treatment Plan ( Nivolumab DC Vaccines Pre-Surgery ) After randomization , patient Group II receive fourth cycle nivolumab receive nivolumab 3 mg/kg IV along DC vaccine intradermally every 2 week x approximately 6 week total 3 vaccine . At time third DC vaccine , patient receive vaccine site pre-conditioning . A single dose Td toxoid ( 1 Lf 0.4 mL saline ) administer single side groin i.d . 12-24 hour third DC vaccine , always give bilaterally groin site . At vaccine # 3 visit , prior vaccine # 3 administration , erythema induration measurement take pre-conditioning site.The subject undergo surgical resection tumor within approximately 1-3 week . Approximately 2-4 week later , leukapheresis repeat generation DC vaccines immunologic monitoring . Approximately 1 day 2 week leukapheresis , subject resume nivolumab 3mg/kg IV every two week . When DC vaccine complete process available administration , monthly DC vaccine administration describe administered 5 month progression ( whichever come first ) . Total vaccine administer 8 ( 3 pre- 5 post-surgery ) unless subject remove . Nivolumab continue progression . At clinic visit follow last vaccine ( # 8 ) , subject peripheral blood drawn immune monitoring prior infusion nivolumab .</detailed_description>
