	<brief_title>Trial Best-Practice Alert Electronic Medical Record Reduce Unnecessary Telemetry Monitoring</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physicians often order continuous cardiac monitoring ( telemetry ) patient hospital . Telemetry provide real-time heart rate rhythm monitoring useful detect arrhythmias evaluate response cardiac therapy . Leads patient 's chest detect electrical signature heartbeat , relay information box patient 's shirt pocket , box relay signal real-time control room technician monitor abnormality . If technician note abnormality contact appropriate provider . Currently , physicians order telemetry UCSF Medical Center without provide indication use . In addition , telemetry remain active provider discontinues patient leave hospital . Studies UCSF hospital nationwide demonstrate telemetry overuse . Physicians either order without valid indication remember discontinue indication longer valid . Guidelines publish American Heart Association provide clarity regard clinical condition warrant telemetry long . However , numerous study demonstrate physician faithfully follow guideline . This lead American Board Internal Medicine Foundation urge physician Hospital Medicine develop protocol govern use telemetry outside intensive care unit 2013 campaign call Choosing Wisely . The harm telemetry overuse myriad : 1 ) Frequent false unimportant alarm lead alarm fatigue study document patient harm subsequent real alarm ignore . False alarm also often necessitate visit patient nurse distracts nurse patient , 2 ) Monitoring patient without active cardiac condition often reveal clinically unimportant abnormality obligate physician work , virtue see monitor . The work-up result unnecessary cost anxiety , 3 ) Leads patient 's chest often fall movement replace nurse . This discourage patient get exercise hospitalize , risk factor muscle atrophy , get enough sleep , risk factor delirium , 4 ) Telemetry available hospital bed UCSF even unit available limitation type arrhythmias monitor . Thus , telemetry monitoring patient need prevent another patient timely access monitor-capable bed . In order reduce unnecessary telemetry use , propose use best-practice alert ( BPA ) deliver physician electronic medical record ( Apex ) . We propose study BPA randomize trial . Physicians Medicine service would randomize either receive BPA patient six month study period . We would examine group follow outcome : physician response alert , total hour telemetry use , number rapid response activation arrhythmic event , number code blue event .</detailed_description>
