	<brief_summary>The objective present study specifically assess effect lipopolysaccharide ( LPS ) administration development behavioral symptom underlie contribution inflammatory process . In particular , investigator assess development subjective objective behavioral symptom . In addition , investigator determine whether psychological trait state predict and/or modulate LPS-induced inflammatory behavioral response . Twenty-five healthy subject include . A placebo-controlled , double-blinded cross-over design use . Subjects receive intravenous injection endotoxin 2 nanogram/kilogram ( ng/kg ) body weight intravenous injection sodium chloride placebo endotoxin injection two different occasion . Prior inclusion randomization , subject come hospital receive medical examination . Psychological variable could affect behavioral ( immune ) response LPS assess time , use several self-assessment questionnaire . On trial day , injection endotoxin sodium chloride perform blood sample take endotoxin sodium chloride injection 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 7.5 hour injection . Blood sample use measure several inflammatory immune marker . Urine sample take endotoxin sodium chloride injection late possible injection . Subjects wear T-shirt day . Urine T-shirt sample use behavioral assessment analysis body odor compound . Self-assessment questionnaire assess behavioral psychological variable complete participant endotoxin sodium chloride injection , three hour 7.5 hour injection . A short questionnaire assess sickness behavior ( SicknessQ ) repeatedly complete participant 7.5 hour endotoxin sodium chloride injection . Several behavioral test use , include motivation task , test assess behavioral response negative sickness stimulus . Analysis gait motion , well social interaction , perform . Photographs take rating face .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study design Twenty-five subject include present study , follow prospective , placebo-controlled cross-over design . Participants blind , well research personnel charge participant laboratory . Subjects randomly assign cross-over design two trial , four week wash-out LPS stimulation : 1 . Trial 1 : endotoxin . Subjects receive intravenous injection endotoxin 2 ng/kg body weight . 2 . Trial 2 : placebo . Subjects receive intravenous injection sodium chloride placebo endotoxin injection . Ten healthy volunteer recruit pilot study prior begin main study , order test behavioral task use . These subject recruit among university staff among university student . They perform four specific behavioral task complete questionnaire assess psychological behavioral variable order associate outcome behavioral task psychological subjective behavioral assessment . No biological sample ( blood , urine tee-shirt sample ) take subject recruit pilot study . Treatment The LPS provide LGC Promochem AB , Albanoliden 5 , 4tr , 506 30 Borås , Sweden . The USP ( United States Pharmacopeial Convention ) Endotoxin ( Cat . No . 1235503 ) come lyophilize ( freeze-dried ) powder vial contains 10,000 USP Endotoxin Units . Each vial contains approximately 1 microgram Endotoxin mix 5 milliliter ( mL ) sterile water . Study procedure The study conduct Department Clinical Sciences , Danderyd Hospital . Prior inclusion randomization , subject come hospital order subject medical examination , include electrocardiogram blood laboratory analysis . Socio-demographic data medical history assess occasion , well body variable ( weight , height , body composition ) physical activity use Swedish version IPAQ ( International Physical Activity Questionnaire ) . History major depression assess use Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( M.I.N.I . ) major depression . Psychological variable could affect behavioral ( immune ) response LPS , believe change screen day trial day , also assess time , use several web-based self-assessment questionnaire . These measure include subject ' perception body health risk ( e.g. , interoceptive awareness , perceive vulnerability disease , health anxiety disgust reactivity , somatosensory amplification , fear anxiety-related sensation ) psychological well-being ( e.g. , perceived stress , optimism , social support , cognitive well-being ) . The overall time medical examination 30-45 minute . The time complete questionnaire estimate approximately 45 minute do home . The participant also receive kit T-shirt ( sewn-in cotton pad ) scent-free soap . Participants ask wear T-shirt morning ( wash armpit ) trial day , take arrival . This allow collect pre-treatment ( baseline ) sample body odor . Participants subject two trial perform randomized order , least six week wash-out : endotoxin versus placebo . The participant ask restrain strenuous exercise alcohol take 48 hour trial day , avoid strong spice 24 hour trial day , take light breakfast morning trial day . Participants arrive morning ( 7.30AM ) . They turn morning T-shirt ( see ) change new T-shirt ( sewn-in cotton pad armpit ) wear day . The T-shirts use behavioral assessment analysis body odor compound . Shortly arrival , two intravenous catheter place : one blood sample one arm one one hand injection endotoxin sodium chloride remove injection . An anesthetic cream provide spread arm order minimize pain venipuncture . Subjects rest least 30 minute . Injection endotoxin sodium chloride perform rest complete ( around 8.30AM ) . Blood sample ( 10 mL EDTA ( Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ) tube 10 mL sodium citrate tube ) take endotoxin sodium chloride injection 1 , 1.5 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 7.5 hour injection . In addition , 2.5 mL PAXGene™ tube take 2 , 4 7.5 hour injection . Two additional sample EDTA tube ( 8 mL blood ) take injection 3 7.5 hour injection . The total quantity blood take 200 mL , correspond third amount give blood donation . Blood sample use measure concentration pro- anti-inflammatory cytokine inflammatory marker ( e.g. , C-Reactive protein - CRP ) use Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay ( ELISA ) , immune cell subpopulation concentration microparticles use flow cytometry , genetic marker use Cap analysis gene expression ( CAGE ) analyse white blood cell count differential . Urine sample take endotoxin sodium chloride injection ( i.e. , catheter place ) late possible injection ( classically around four hour injection ) . Participants monitor continuous electrocardiogram . Oxygen saturation ( SO2 ) , blood pressure body temperature monitor every 30 minute . Nitrogen dioxide ( NO2 ) monitor continuously , methemoglobin checked time blood sample . Self-assessment questionnaire assess behavioral psychological variable complete participant endotoxin sodium chloride injection ( rest period ) , three hour 7.5 hour injection . A short questionnaire assess sickness behavior ( SicknessQ ) repeatedly complete participant 7.5 hour endotoxin sodium chloride injection . Subjects film bed wear sociometric badge , order analyze participant ' behavioral response standardize situation social interaction . Photographs take ( i.e. , catheter place ) , two hour 7.5 hour injection , rating face ( e.g. , health , attractiveness , tiredness ) . In parallel , skin color measure time blood sample ( except T1.5 ) order assess potential mediating effect face ' health rating . Analysis subject ' gait motion perform two half hour injection . Short computerize cognitive test perform test , three hour injection . Subjects perform motivation task complete questionnaire three hour injection . In addition , two test assess behavior response positive/negative healthy/sickness stimulus ( approach-avoidance behavior test regulation emotion test ) execute three hour half injection . Participants allow take light meal ( snack juice drink ) around lunch time ( 12.30 ) hand T-shirt five half hour injection . The last blood sample take 7.5 hour injection participant discharge . Monitoring experiment do medical doctor , supervise specialist anesthesia intensive care .</detailed_description>
