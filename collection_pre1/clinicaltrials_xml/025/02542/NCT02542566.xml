	<brief_title>Protected Versus Early Weight Bearing Post Microfracture Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>To test use randomise control trial , whether conservative rehabilitation protect weight bearing versus early weight bearing accelerate rehabilitation affect patient outcome post microfracture surgery knee . Current practice unit protect patient weight bear prior enter conservative physiotherapy rehabilitation program follow microfracture surgery knee . At unit believe protect patient weight bear post microfracture surgery make difference outcome lead long rehabilitation time delay return work sport . Therefore want randomise patient require microfracture surgery knee cartilage defect 2 post operative rehabilitation group . One group able weight bear early undergo accelerate rehabilitation program whilst protect weight bearing undergo conservative rehabilitation program . We follow patient year compare outcome data collect 6 week , 3 month , 6 month 1 year post operatively see difference outcomes 2 group . As secondary outcome also compare patient two group see difference time take return work sport activity</detailed_description>
