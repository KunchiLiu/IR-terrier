	<brief_summary>It select 1274 subject old 40 year population Cabra order realize sociodemographic habit ( toxic , food , physical activity ) survey . It realize physical exploration include anthropometry , blood pressure , oral glucose tolerance test , blood extraction ( basal 120 ' OGTT ) . Several biochemical determination realize ( p.e . marker fat intake marker inflammation ) The propose intervention consist series clinical visit phone call programmed aim change dietetic physical activity habit people . The Pizarra study ( financed grant realise methodology ) use cohort control . Though basic aim project achieve reduction diabetes incidence hygienic - sanitary intervention , ambition know major number possible factor participate process constitutes complex project capable analyze problem diverse point view . Endocrinologists ( two Andalusian hospital ) , clinical biochemist , geneticist dietitians join project approach integral way etiopathogeny diabetes type 2 .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Intervention study population : Egabro Study . This study commence 2009 Cabra , town 20,000 inhabitant locate Subbética region Cordoba Province ( Spain ) . The study include person age 40 year . 2 . Control population : Pizarra Study . The Pizarra Study progress since 1995 . The detail study subject multiple publication ( see CVs ) . The start Egabro Study coincide third evaluation Pizarra cohort , well extension population base , enable whole population Pizarra age 40 year study . 3 . Design : A prospective cohort study exposure intervention hygiene health habit : Cohort A. Egabro Study : First phase : Cross-sectional prevalence study Second phase : Intensive intervention study certain risk group ( Cohort study , control group ) Cohort B. Pizarra Study : First phase : Prevalence study ( cross-sectional , extension initial cohort ) Second phase : Follow-up cohort , use control group intervention study Egabro project 4 . Subjects susceptible intervention : 1 . Persons , oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) , identify phenotype Impaired Fasting Glucose ( IFG ) 2 . Persons , OGTT , identify diabetes mellitus . 5 . Sampling . Sample size The calculation sample size do accord recommendation Carné X et al . ( Carné X , et al . Medicina Clín ( Barc ) , 1989 ; 92:72-73 ) . The sample size calculate main study endpoint base Pizarra study data aim decrease risk diabetes 50 % ( alpha=0.05 , power=90 % ) . The minimum sample size 479 subject cohort . To date , investigator enrol 600 subject cohort random sample . 6 . Intervention protocol : The intervention undertaken consist series program clinical visit telephone call order change dietary lifestyle habit participant . Briefly : Level 1 intervention General recommendation healthy diet physical activity referral general physician report study result event detect risk factor pathological finding . The procedure standard use date Pizarra study continue use cohort . Subjects normal OGTT Egabro Study also use . Level 2 intervention This consist intensive intervention dietary physical activity habit well Level 1 recommendation . It carry subject Egabro Study alteration OGTT : IFG , IGT previously unknown diabetes . All recommend attend family physician report result order receive standard treatment case ( Level 1 intervention ) . Additionally , intervention protocol include base office visit 4 month first year , well monthly telephone call first year . Each subject also attend group educational meeting 6 month . At visit give series recommendation degree adherence evaluate evolution weight check The recommendation design re-educate subject concern dietary physical activity habit : 7.Follow : two year SPECIFIC METHODS basal study follow : Field work ( basal end first year second year intervention ( observation control cohort ) : 1 . An OGTT give participant alter OGTT baseline study ( 200 subject Egabro cohort + 200 subject Pizarra cohort ) . 2 . Serum obtain fast OGTT . 3 . Records make weight , height , waist hip circumference , skinfold thickness ( suprailiac , subscapular , bicipital tricipital ) blood pressure . 4 . Muscle strength estimate measured hand grip dynamometry 5 . A dietary questionnaire give ( 24 hour recall + frequency survey ) 6 . An evaluation make physical activity 7 . Questions ask sociodemographic variation incidence disease since previous visit 8 . The data include general database project . Biochemical study ( basal end first year second year intervention ( observation control cohort ) : Determination glucose , insulin , cholesterol , triglyceride , HDL cholesterol , LDL cholesterol , ferritin , C-reactive protein , liver enzymes , urea , uric acid creatinine fast serum glucose insulin post OGTT serum , one two year follow-up . DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS 1 . The first visit do two participate endocrinologist , one register nurse one nutritional technician expressly employ study ( one team cohort ) . 2 . Informed consent request . Each participant complete questionnaire close exhaustive question . The physical examination make accordance method recommend WHO ( WHO Technical Report Series 854 , Geneva 1995 ) . Data collect weight , height waist hip circumference participant light clothing without shoe use calibrated standardized electronic scale , stadiometer metric measure . The blood pressure also take , digital sphygmomanometer ( Omron , Hem-703C ) . The dynamometry do right hand record three determination . 3 . All participant , except say diabetic capillary blood glucose &gt; 180 mg/dL , underwent OGTT 75 gr glucose venous extraction baseline 2 hour , accordance recommendation 1985 WHO technical report . The participant know report diabetes check diagnosis diabetes ( clinical chart ) undergo fast blood extraction . Thirty minute extraction sample centrifuge `` situ '' use portable centrifuge . The sample store aliquot frozen situ 15 day store definitively _80ºC . Determinations make blood glucose , cholesterol , HDL cholesterol triglyceride use routine standardize technique . The LDL cholesterol calculate Friedewald equation , exclude participant triglyceride &gt; 400 mg/dL . The blood serum sample store -80ºC follow protocols National DNA Bank metabolic disease . The blood use genotyping ( see ) serum make biochemical fatty acid measurement ( gas chromatography methyl derivative ) contemplate study . 4 . The diagnostic criterion normality , IFG , IGT type 2 diabetes mellitus use established 1999 WHO expert committee . 5 . The criterion use define hypertension US Joint National Committee VI . 6 . To typify weight group body mass index ( BMI ) use ( BMI = weight kg/height m2 ) waist-to-hip ratio . For smoking , participant consider smoker smoke quit smoking within previous six month . A family history type 2 diabetes consider present participant report disease first-degree relative ( parent , sibling , child ) . 7 . Lipid abnormality identify Brunzell criterion ( Brunzell et al . Diabetes Care 2008 ) . 8 . Nutritional evaluation : The nutritional questionnaire design collect information nutritional habit , frequency amount food . The following tool use . 8.1 Twenty-four hour recall survey : repeat two different time year . 8.2 Food frequency questionnaire , follow recommendation Willet ( Nutritional Epidemiology . Oxford University Press , Oxford , 1990 ) . The questionnaire give experienced dietitian previously train project . 8.3 The transformation nutrient dietary information do computerize conversion accord Moreiras Martín , modify one researcher group use source ( Soriguer F. et al . European Journal Epidemiology 13:451-463,1997 ) well nutrient table ( Mataix J. Universidad de Granada , 2003 ) . 8.4 Scale adherence Mediterranean diet base result questionnaires 9 . The evaluation physical activity do questionnaires frequency activity ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS AND STATISTICAL STUDY . All information derive Pizarra Egabro study collect specially design computerized database . Statistical hypothesis contrast variable accord prevision hypothesis elaborate design use parametric non parametric test accord adjustment normality . The strength association crosssectional study measure calculate odds ratio 2×2 table coefficient logistic model adjust possible confounding variable . To compare incidence / prevention rate metabolic disorder , two cohort standardize age sex relative risk calculate correspond CI . The multivariate analysis do use Cox regression . LIMITATIONS : Bias participation : study population , certain group tend participate likely others . It compensate also work weekend holidays prevent work people participate less . The design `` quasiexperimental '' . The indication bias intervention program carry adjusted use propensity score method , enable elimination indication bias make study closer , use technique pair ( `` near '' method ) similar situation experimental study , use probability predict logistic model .
