	<brief_title>Glycemic Control Treatment Satisfaction Using Finesse Versus Pen Initiating Bolus Insulin Dosing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients Not Achieving Glycemic Targets Basal Insulin With/Without Anti-Hyperglycemic Agents</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients sub-optimally control basal insulin ( with/without antihyperglycemic agent ( AHAs ) ) randomize 1:1 either Finesse pen initiate bolus insulin dose follow 44-week intervention period . Patients basal bolus dos insulin adjust throughout trial , clinically indicate , base easy follow insulin dose algorithm . After final endpoint evaluation week 44 , patient crossover alternate bolus insulin delivery device 4 week complete patient preference survey week 48 .</detailed_description>
