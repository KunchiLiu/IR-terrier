	<brief_title>Effect Oral Magnesium Vascular Calcification Chronic Kidney Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) associate increase cardiovascular morbidity mortality independent traditional cardiovascular risk factor due increase vascular calcification . Epidemiological experimental data suggest hypermagnesemia magnesium supplementation reduce vascular calcification CKD increase calcium/phosphate solubility serum , inhibit calcium influx vascular smooth muscle cell ( VSMC ) , inhibit intracellular pro-calcification enzyme VSMC increase activity intracellular anti-calcification enzyme VSMC . However , concern anti-calcification effect magnesium might also reduce bone mineral density , case might increase risk bone fracture associate magnesium supplementation CKD . We wish conduct randomize placebo-controlled double-blinded interventional trial examine whether oral magnesium supplementation reduce vascular calcification subject CKD decrease bone mineral density .</detailed_description>
