	<brief_title>Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Treating Patients With Metastatic Recurrent Kidney Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish patient treated 5-fraction stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) sit metastatic disease low ( &lt; 16 % ) rate severe ( grade 4 ) toxicity . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine toxicity profile SBRT . II . To determine feasibility deliver 5-fraction SBRT per protocol base propose normal tissue constraint variety organ site . ( i.e. , ability treat &gt; 80 % enrol patient accord protocol guideline ) . III . To describe treated lesion control ( LeC ) , progression free survival ( PFS ) , patterns failure . IV . To determine feasibility accrual adequacy eligibility criterion define proportion eligible case metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( RCC ) present weekly multidisciplinary genitourinary conference University Chicago Medical Center . V. To make preliminary evaluation regard potential biomarkers patient serum may endpoints follow-up study ( e.g . genetic immunologic biomarkers ) . OUTLINE : Patients undergo stereotactic body radiation therapy day 1 3 time week 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow month 3 month every 3 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
