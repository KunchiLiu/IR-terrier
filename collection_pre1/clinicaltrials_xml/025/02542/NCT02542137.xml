	<brief_summary>Patients small cell lung cancer metastatic lesion treat definitive surgery chemoradiotherapy ask participate study . 1 . To observe immunity-mediated tumor response outside radiation field ( abscopal effect ) chemoradiotherapy metastatic site metastatic small cell lung cancer patient . 2 . To induce efficacy ( effectiveness ) new combination therapy , chemoradiotherapy thymalfasin heavily pretreated , metastatic small cell lung cancer patient ; 3 . To explore role PET/CT scan assess tumor response/abscopal effect .

	<detailed_description>1 . To observe immunity-mediated tumor response outside radiation field ( abscopal effect ) chemoradiotherapy metastatic site metastatic small cell lung cancer patient . 2 . To induce efficacy ( effectiveness ) new combination therapy , chemoradiotherapy thymalfasin heavily pretreated , metastatic small cell lung cancer patient ; 3 . To explore role PET/CT scan assess tumor response/abscopal effect . Eligible patient metastatic small cell lung cancer achieve stable disease disease progression systemic therapy ( surgery definitive chemoradiotherapy ) least three separate measurable site metastatic lesion . Extent metastatic disease record CT PET/CT scan . Radiation give combine therapy one lesion , 35Gy 10 fraction two week interval , conformally maximally spare normal tissue organ . Thymalfasin treatment give twice week interval 3-4 day week . At day 22 radiation re-started radiation dose deliver second metastatic site , thymalfasin . Abscopal response evaluate assess clinical PET/CT response non-irradiated measurable metastatic site . A Phase II clinical trial base optimum two-stage Phase II Simon design use conduct pilot study . Ten patient treated Stage one ; abscopal response , trial terminate . If one abscopal responses Stage One , trial proceed enroll additional 19 patient .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Patients histologically confirm small cell lung cancer persistent metastatic recurrent metastatic ; 2 . Patients must least 3 distinct measurable metastatic site least 1 cm large large diameter ; 3 . Age ≥18 year ; 4 . Metastatic disease measurable CT/MRI scan . The primary tumor consider measurable disease . Metastatic lesion within prior radiation field acceptable long disease progress radiation field RECIST criterion . The image modality perform baseline ( CT MRI ) repeat subsequent imaging . 5 . ECOG performance status : 01 ; 6 . Life expectancy ≥ 3 month . 7 . Patients adequate baseline organ marrow function define absolute neutrophil count great 1500 cell per μL , platelet concentration great 50 000 per μL , total bilirubin le 1•5 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) , aspartate aminotransferase alanine aminotransferase less 2•5 time ULN , serum creatinine le 1•5 time ULN ; 8 . Signed consent form voluntarily ; 1 . Patients undergo therapy investigational agent . 2 . Women pregnant breastfeeding ; 3 . Patients know brain metastasis include clinical trial brain lesion eligible target non target lesion ; 4 . Active severe infection know chronic infection HIV , hepatitis B virus , hepatitis C virus ; 5 . Cardiovascular disease problem include unstable angina , therapy lifethreatening ventricular arrhythmia , myocardial infarction , stroke congestive heart failure within last 6 month ; 6 . The subject another active malignancy within past five year except cervical cancer site , situ carcinoma bladder nonmelanoma carcinoma skin ; 7 . Clinically significant uncontrolled major medical condition include limited : active uncontrolled infection , symptomatic congestive heart failure , Unstable angina pectoris cardiac arrhythmia , psychiatric illness/ social situation would limit compliance study requirement ; medical condition , opinion study investigator place subject unacceptably high risk toxicity ; 8 . Patients concurrent disease , judgment investigator , would make patient inappropriate participation study .</criteria>
