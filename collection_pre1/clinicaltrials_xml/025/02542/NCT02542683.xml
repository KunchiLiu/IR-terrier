	<brief_summary>1 . Compare physical activity cognitive function child cardiac surgery age-matched group child undergo non-cardiac surgery , well otherwise healthy sibling best buddy ( age gender-matched child sibling best buddy available ) surgery surgery six month follow initial assessment . 2 . Determine effect structure physical activity program 6 month follow surgery cognitive function adaptive behavior child follow congenital cardiac surgery . 3 . Determine effect structure physical activity program 12 month follow surgery cognitive function adaptive behavior child follow congenital cardiac surgery . 4 . We perform exploratory analysis determine whether effect 12-months structured physical activity program cognitive function adaptive behavior persist beyond 12 month cessation program .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Mortality associate congenital heart defect ( CHD ) decrease significantly world-wide past decade . As CHD patient survive beyond infancy childhood , patient find significant risk developmental disability developmental delay . In CHD patient , neurodevelopmental impairment , suggest recent data Boston Circulatory Arrest Trial , appear become serious increase age . As mature adolescent adult , area neurocognitive abnormality become evident . These abnormality significantly influence ability function independently daily live impact quality life . Physical activity show improve cognitive function adult improve attentional inhibition cognitive flexibility school-age child 7 9 year age . An exercise program also show improve self-reported cognitive function parent-reported social functioning old child adolescent ( age 10-25 year ) Tetralogy Fallot single ventricle physiology . Of note , neuroimaging study document physical activity induces increase hippocampal volume corresponds observed improvement memory task . Since neurocognitive function CHD patient become bad get old , early intervention mitigate neurocognitive impairment patient modify negative neurodevelopmental trajectory thus could major impact mental cognitive well-being CHD patient . The purpose study test hypothesis regular , structure physical activity program recommend American Heart Association improve cognitive function adaptive behavior child CHD cardiac surgery .</detailed_description>
