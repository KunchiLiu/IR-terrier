	<detailed_description>The anti-inflammatory effect glucocorticoid well know . The beneficial effect postoperative pain , postoperative nausea vomit well-documented . Hip-arthroplasty surgery inflammatory stress response general affect potential recovery . The basic physiological mechanism behind restoration recovery surgery still unresolved . The many different immune cell involve complex signal response enable wound heal recovery , individual immune signal pattern might able predict recovery . The effect glucocorticoid immune signal pattern unknown call investigation . The study consider exploratory . This study embed primary study registrated : NCT02445898 For detail please view EudraCT registration : EudraCT nr . : 2015-000102-19</detailed_description>
