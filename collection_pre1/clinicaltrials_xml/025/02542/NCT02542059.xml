	<brief_summary>In order evaluate difference beta cell mass patient without complete resolution type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) Roux en Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) investigator aim compare quantitative PET image pancreas patient group . These highly relevant data provide investigator information possible role beta cell mass mechanism behind resolution T2DM bariatric surgery . This would great interest assessment RYGB alternative therapy patient T2DM BMI &lt; 35 , currently meet international guideline bariatric surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Obesity T2DM The prevalence Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus ( T2D ) Netherlands 600.000-800.000 year ~70.000 new patient diagnose . This increase number patient T2D closely correlate obesity epidemic . In woman , 50 % T2D risk account obesity . Also , 85 % T2D patient overweight ~50 % obese . Obese patient T2D elevate glucose level also risk develop dyslipidemia hypertension . This cluster cardiovascular risk factor lead increase risk micro-and macrovascular long-term complication . In fact , patient T2D 2-4 time increase risk cardiovascular disease . These complication seriously decrease quality life life expectancy T2D patient . The burden disease affect patient society well . Health care cost respect diabetes amount 814 million euro 2005 Netherlands indirect cost absence work unknown think substantial . Weight loss perhaps important therapeutic intervention obese patient T2D . Weight loss intervenes underlie pathophysiology restores insulin sensitivity sometimes even insulin secretion . In addition , improve dyslipidemia hypertension . In contrast , pharmacological intervention relieve symptom complex disease process underlie T2DM whilst disease process address even progress course time . Unfortunately , effect weight loss intervention diet lifestyle even drug often modest ( 3-5 kg ) short-lived . Bariatric surgery T2DM remission Weight reduce surgery , i.e . bariatric surgery , intervention lead persistent weight loss superior conventional ( non-surgical ) treatment . Bariatric surgery divide restrictive ( gastric band ) malabsorptive procedure ( biliopancreatic diversion ) combination 2 ( Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass , RYGB ) . The current indication BMI &gt; 40 kg/m2 BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2 co-morbidities like T2D . The great malabsorptive component , great effect weight loss . Meta-analyses also show spectacular metabolic improvement bariatric surgery obese patient T2D . The mechanism diabetes resolution RYGB completely understand evidence might completely dependent weight loss . While significant weight loss yet achieve within day surgery , glycemic control find occur already time . Also , improvement glucose control gastric bypass great equivalent weight loss obtain dietary intervention purely restrictive bariatric procedure . There several hypothesis concern weight-independent effect bariatric surgery insulin secretion . The popular one 'hindgut-hypothesis ' , state expedite delivery nutrient distal intestine enhances secretion intestinal peptide like glucagon-like-peptide 1 ( GLP1 ) peptide YY 'foregut hypothesis ' , state exclusion duodenum proximal jejunum transit nutrient result change secretion intestinal peptide . However , several mechanism , in- outside intestine might play role . While improvement beta cell function report healthy individual well T2D patient RYGB unclear whether actual beta cell mass subject change bariatric surgery . In Goto-Kakizaki rat duodenal jejunal bypass find increase pancreatic concentration vesicular monoamine transporter type 2 ( VMAT2 ) , biomarker beta cell . Furthermore , increase beta cell mass , beta cell number extra islet beta cell find RYGB porcine model . However , study human , conflict result . The benefit bariatric surgery glycemic control morbidly obese patient ( BMI 35 kg/m2 ) T2DM confirm accepted alternative therapy patient population treatment T2DM Diabetes Surgery Summit Consensus Conference ( DSS ) , participate 50 expert endorse multiple international scientific society ( American Diabetes Association ( ADA ) International Federation Surgery Obesity Metabolic diseases ( IFSO ) ) International Diabetes Federation Taskforce epidemioloy Prevention Diabetes , consensus work group diabetologists , surgeon public health expert . They also consider expand indication bariatric surgery obese patient T2D currently n't meet international guideline bariatric surgery . In regard , information effect bariatric surgery beta cell function beta cell mass would helpful . If information could obtain preoperatively would improve selection patient would benefit bariatric surgery . Imaging beta cell vivo Reliable , sensitive specific visualization living pancreatic beta cell vivo important broaden understanding resolution T2D bariatric surgery . Reliable quantification remain beta cell mass lead well assessment beta cell function bariatric surgery . This could lead good understand relative importance factor lead recovery glycemic control . This could help consideration whether expand indication bariatric surgery patient T2D currently meet criterion ( BMI &lt; 35 ) .</detailed_description>
