	<detailed_description>1 . Introduction Though type 2 diabetes mellitus ( T2DM ) strong genetic component , genetic basis T2DM ( least gene far study ) little predict risk T2DM traditional risk prediction criterion , family history , obesity , previous glycemic alteration . From perspective , T2DM prototype complex disease , consider result interaction different gene gene environmental factor diet sedentary habit . Because , study gene-environment interaction extremely important determine risk develop diabetes and/or asociated metabolic disease . Our overall objective study interaction representative sample Spanish population , part study prevalence incidence T2DM . Fatty acid transporter . The management lipid , particularly regulation uptake fatty acid tissue relation disease much interest . Several protein undertake transport , important fatty acid translocase ( FAT/CD36 ) , fatty acid bind protein ( FABP ) fatty acid transport protein ( FATP ) . The reason variety transporter unclear . In muscle obese person T2DM speed fatty acid transport increase comparison lean overweight person . They find associated increase membrane content fatty acid transporter FAT/CD36 , FABPpm . The increased fatty acid uptake contributes excess accumulation triglyceride cytoplasm due increase esterification , alteration rate oxidation . These protein highly regulate tissue hormone ( insulin leptin ) transcription factor . The adipocyte concentration FABP serum correlate component metabolic syndrome may prognostic indicator efficacy weight loss intervention . The fatty acid present blood must cross endothelium reach tissue metabolize . The vascular endothelial growth factor B ( VEGF-B ) play important role process . Knock-out mice VEGF-B low uptake accumulation fatty acid muscle , cardiac brown adipose tissue accumulate lipid white adipose tissue . The process mediate receptor VEGFR1 ( FLT1 ) neuropilin-1 express endothelium . The low accumulation lipid myocytes related great insulin sensitivity . Thus , low VEGF-B activity reduces intramyocellular lipid improve insulin sensitivity , tissue tends take glucose obtain sufficient energy purpose , divert fatty acid adipose tissue . The participation VEGF-B lipid uptake open possibility new strategy modulate pathological accumulation lipid produce diabetes , obesity cardiovascular disease . No study yet relate genetic variability VEGF-B alteration glucose homeostasis . In addition , risk value prospective study genetic variant transporter regulatory protein , particularly VEGF-B , still unexplored aspect . The di @ bet.es study . This first national study Spain design objective determine prevalence incidence diabetes mellitus . The team request project part Steering Committee di @ bet.es study . The result cross-sectional study recently publish . The study collect numerous anthropometric , biochemical lifestyle ( exercise diet ) variables allow detailed analysis factor associate prevalence diabetes population ( 13 article publish far ) . The DNA sample collect , together phenotype information obtain , enable u examine association mention genetics fatty acid transporter , regulatory mechanism , relation ( cross longitudinal ) diabetic phenotype , among others , interaction nutritional factor . The fact Spanish population base cohort study make extremely useful test bench examine gene-gene gene-nutrient interaction explanation incidence diabetes . 2 . Hypothesis Objectives General hypothesis : In state excess intake , genetic variant VEGF-B induce low tissue VEGF-B activity could protect diabetes ( metabolic syndrome ) whilst adipose tissue accommodate excess energy , whereas person high activity quickly develop insulin resistance , metabolic syndrome diabetes , due lipotoxicity produce excess fatty acid introduce tissue . Specific hypothesis : 1 . The genetic variant fatty acid transporter regulatory protein ( VEGF-B ) relate risk diabetes and/or metabolic syndrome affect onset T2DM . 2 . Various gene-nutrient interaction exist explanation factor affect development diabetes . Objectives A . To determine incidence type 2 diabetes Spain B . To show presence particular allele gene encode fatty acid transporter regulatory protein ( VEGF-B ) : 1. associate risk develop type 2 diabetes carbohydrate metabolism disorder four year follow . 2. associate risk become obese , hypertension metabolic syndrome four year follow . C. To demonstrate gene-gene gene-nutrient interaction . 3-Work plan 3.1- Design : A prospective , population-based cohort study . 3.2- Definition outcome variable whose risk investigator want measure : Presence type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnose OGTT and/or metabolic syndrome five year follow . 3.3- Defining population risk : The study base di @ bet.es study , cross-sectional study undertaken 2007-2010 random cluster sample Spanish population 18 year age . DNA sample available Biobank CIBERDEM . Exclusion criterion : subject diabetes cross-sectional study , serious illness , pregnancy , surgery within previous month , disable situation prevents participation exclude study . The investigator data 5072 people . Of , 4400 free diabetes cross-sectional study . Follow-up loss could 25 % ( know previous study ) . The expected final sample comprise 3300 person . 3.4- Identification exposure factor : Primary exposure factor : - Subjects classify accord blood glucose normal OGTT ( unexposed subject ) impair fast glucose ( IFG ) impair glucose tolerance ( IGT ) ( exposed subject ) . - Insulin Resistance Homeostasis Model Assessment quartile , calculate prior knowledge distribution variable IR-HOMA entire study population . - The genotype gene involve fatty acid transport . About 160 SNPs follow gene : VEGF-B , FLT1 ( VEGF-B receptor ) , neuropilin ( VEGF-B receptor ) , CD36 , FABP1 , FABP1 , FABP4 , FABP6 , FATP1 , FATP2 , FATP3 , FATP4 , FATP5 FATP6 . Secondary exposure factor potential confounders 1 . Anthropometric variable : weight , body mass index ( BMI ) , waist circumference , hip circumference , waist hip ratio . 2 . Sociological variable : age , education level , marital status . 3 . Habits : Physical activity ( general , sport , IPAQ questionnaire ) , smoke habit , alcohol intake , psychotropic drug intake . 4 . Associated disease : hypertension , dyslipidemia . 5 . Food frequency questionnaire dietary habit . 6 . Biochemical variable , liver profile , serum iron ferritin , hsCRP ( unspecified inflammatory state ) . 3.5-Exposure time : The cross-sectional study undertaken 2007 2010 , assume development particular project 2015-16 , follow-up time : median = 5.9 year , minimum = 5.1 year maximum = 7.3 year . 3.6-Proceedings . 3.6.1-Fieldwork : The subject select follow-up sent letter mail invite participate second phase study .
