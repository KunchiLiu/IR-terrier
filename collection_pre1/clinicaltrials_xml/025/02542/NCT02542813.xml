	<brief_summary>Intramuscular ( IM ) oxytocin gold standard prophylactic therapy post partum haemorrhage ( PPH ) . However , resource-poor setting within develop world , stability therefore effectiveness prophylactic IM oxytocin diminish lack appropriate refrigeration facility availability train health care professional ( HCPs ) administer IM injection . This study first investigation oxytocin human via inhale ( IH ) route design evaluate safety tolerability inhale oxytocin five non-pharmacologically active component placebo , establish PK characteristic four fix escalate dos inhale oxytocin . In single blind ascend dose-escalation study , systemic exposure four propose escalate inhale fixed-dose level ( 50 microgram [ mcg ] , 200 mcg , 400 mcg 600 mcg ) compare systemic exposure follow 10 international unit ( IU ) IM oxytocin healthy premenopausal females.. A total 15 subject enrol screen sufficient number healthy female subject subject assign one two treatment sequence . The total duration study approximately 20 week .</brief_summary>
