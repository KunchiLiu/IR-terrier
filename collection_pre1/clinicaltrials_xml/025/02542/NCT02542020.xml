	<brief_summary>Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection major global health issue 40 million people infected worldwide . Due highly active antiretroviral therapy , mortality relate acquire immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) reduce last decade . However , liver disease remain important cause severe complication death . Hepatic fibrosis progression main responsible liver-related outcome HIV-positive patient . Co-infection hepatitis B ( HBV ) hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) highly prevalence HIV patient . Chronic viral co-infection induces faster liver fibrosis progression compare mono-infected HIV . However , publish data report presence significant liver fibrosis HIV without HBV HCV infection . This might relate direct action HIV hepatocytes association others factor , non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) . NAFLD associate metabolic factor , obesity type-2 diabetes mellitus . However , antiretroviral drug may induce abnormal body fat distribution ( lipodistrophy ) insulin resistance play important role process . Liver biopsy historically consider gold standard evaluate liver injury . However , painful method present several limitation . Therefore , several non-invasive method estimation liver fibrosis , biomarkers ( APRI , FIB-4 , FibroTest FibroMeter ) transient elastography Fibroscan , develop alternative liver biopsy . The diagnostic performance prognostic value biomarkers transient elastography validated patient chronic liver disease . However , data available HIV patient , especially without chronic viral co-infection . Therefore , patient , medical doctor scientific community beneficiate future application non-invasive method estimation liver injury clinical practice HIV patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Prospective Evaluation HIV Patients Using Non-invasive Methods Estimation Liver Fibrosis Steatosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In HIV-positive patient without chronic viral hepatitis co-infection , primary aim project : ( ) estimate prevalence incidence liver injury ( include progression fibrosis , necro-inflammatory activity steatosis ) report normal value non-invasive method HIV population ; ( ii ) validate diagnostic performance non-invasive method use method without gold standard ( Latent Class Analysis ) ; ( iii ) validate prognostic value non-invasive marker predict overall mortality liver-related outcome ( iv ) correlate liver injury nutritional status . The secondary aim constitution cohort HIV patient , without chronic viral hepatitis co-infection long-term follow-up severe outcomes . This prospective cohort study approve Local Ethical Committee ( CAAE : 32889514.4.0000.5262 ) enrol patient June 2015 Evandro Chagas National Institute Infectious Diseases - Oswaldo Cruz Foundation ( INI - FioCruz ) , Rio de Janeiro , Brazil . A total 2,000 patient include study next 5 year . This project aim report prevalence incidence liver disease representative sample HIV patient without chronic viral hepatitis co-infection . In addition , risk factor associate presence progression liver fibrosis steatosis identify innovative non-invasive management estimation liver injury HIV patient validate . Patients submit day follow procedure : ( ) clinical examination ( anthropometric demographic characteristic ) , ( ii ) blood sample collection ( blood analysis , calculation biomarkers stockage sample ) , ( iii ) transient elastography ( M XL probe single experience operator ( &gt; 2,000 examination ) ( iv ) nutritional status ( bioelectrical impedance 24h diet recall ) .</detailed_description>
