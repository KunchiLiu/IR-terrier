Biological therapy , clarithromycin , pomalidomide , dexamethasone , use substance make live organism may stimulate immune system different way stop cancer cell grow . Ixazomib citrate may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth .

	<brief_title>Ixazomib With Pomalidomide , Clarithromycin Dexamethasone Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To establish maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) PiC-D therapy ( pomalidomide , ixazomib [ ixazomib citrate ] , clarithromycin , dexamethasone ) patient multiple myeloma bortezomib lenalidomide refractory . ( Phase I ) II . To determine complete response ( CR ) stringent CR ( sCR ) rate PiC-D therapy patient multiple myeloma bortezomib lenalidomide refractory . ( Phase II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability PiC-D therapy . ( Phase I ) II . To characterize pharmacokinetics ( PK ) plasma oral ixazomib combination pomalidomide , clarithromycin dexamethasone . ( Phase I ) III . To assess preliminary evidence clinical activity . ( Phase I ) IV . To assess effect PiC-D therapy quality life ( QOL ) . ( Phase I ) V. To assess effect PiC-D therapy immune status ( phenotypic analysis cytokine profile ) . VI . To evaluate safety PiC-D therapy . ( Phase II ) VII . To determine overall response rate ( ORR ) ( ORR ; CR , sCR , partial response , good partial response . ( Phase II ) VIII . To determine clinical benefit rate ( CBR ) ( CBR ; minimal response + ORR ) . ( Phase II ) IX . To determine disease control rate ( DCR ) ( DCR ; stable disease + CBR ) . ( Phase II ) X . To determine duration response ( DOR ) patient achieve partial response well . ( Phase II ) XI . To determine time next treatment ( TNT ) . ( Phase II ) XII . To determine progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) . ( Phase II ) XIII . To assess effect PiC-D therapy quality life ( QOL ) . ( Phase II ) TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess effect PiC-D therapy immune status ( phenotypic analysis cytokine profile ) . ( Phase II ) OUTLINE : This phase I , dose-escalation study clarithromycin follow phase II study . Patients receive pomalidomide orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-21 ; ixazomib citrate PO day 1 , 8 , 15 ; clarithromycin PO twice daily ( BID ) day 15-21 course 1 day 1-21 course 2-6 ; dexamethasone PO day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Patients receive pomalidomide , ixazomib citrate , dexamethasone receive clarithromycin PO BID QD . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 2-3 month 3 year .</detailed_description>
