	<detailed_description>The Low Field Magnetic Stimulation ( LFMS ) procedure application series electromagnetic pulse brain . The field time parameter LFMS pulse , pulse timing , duration , frequency , electric magnetic field distribution direction different neurostimulation method . LFMS electromagnetic field significantly weak ( &lt; 100x ) use ECT rTMS . LFMS discover McLean Hospital thus far studied experimental antidepressant treatment McLean Hospital . LFMS also study Massachusetts General Hospital 5 hospital NIH sponsor trial ( RAPID ) well study Cornell-Weill School Medicine . The mechanism action antidepressant effect LFMS hypothesize interaction electromagnetic field neuron cortical region , bring low level electrical stimulation apply particular timing . The current study propose assess effect daily LFMS treatment participant suffer affective disorder and/or anxiety . This open-label study . All subject receive active LFMS treatment .
