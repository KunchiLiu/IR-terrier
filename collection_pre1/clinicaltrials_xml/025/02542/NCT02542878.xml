	<brief_title>Effect Myofascial Release Foam Rolling Back Muscles Endurance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Self-myofascial release perform foam roller incoming technique popular sport . Scientific literature currently suggest effect self-myofascial release mediate stimulation neural connective tissue . There evidence stimulation could improve maximum range motion decrease muscle soreness . Nonetheless , evidence effect self-myofascial release muscle endurance . Given increase use autonomously ( self-treatment ) athlete population , study aim assess effect low back short application ( 60 second ) back extensor muscle endurance measure Biering-Sorensen test . With obtained result want elaborate evideced base recommendation use prior physical activity sport competition .</detailed_description>
