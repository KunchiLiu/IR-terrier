	<detailed_description>Identification problem : Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) third common human malignancy , also lead cause cancer relate death worldwide . Early detection premalignant lesion adenomatous polyp decrease risk CRCs ; however , case initially undetected progress advance CRC distant metastasis still unfortunately incurable . The development CRC complex heterogeneous process arise interaction multiple etiological factor , include genetic factor environmental factor diet lifestyle .

Besides microsatellite instability ( MSI ) , researcher report novel mitochondrial mutation cancer genomes.NGS technology help investigator understand entire CRC genome obtain knowledge lead well diagnosis personalize targeted therapeutic CRC management.Experimental design : The study design attempt identify unique mutational spectrum novel target genomic , epigenetic alteration Egyptian colorectal cancer patient Delta Regionusing Whole Exome Epigenetic deep sequencing.Expected result : NGS-based genome analysis facilitate identification unrecognized gene mutation Egyptian CRC cancer especially Delta Region may biologically different Western CRC environmental factor different.Significance expect result : The result project benefit ( 1 ) Identification novel feature mutation type CRC genome In Delta Region . ( 2 ) Understanding advancement pathway-level colorectal carcinogenesis ( 3 ) Identify Clinically relevant genetic epigenetic biomarkers noninvasive diagnosis clinically actionable target personalize targeted medicine .</detailed_description>
