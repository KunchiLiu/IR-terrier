	<brief_title>A Study Evaluating Overall Pain Relief Safety Intravenous ( IV ) CR845 Patients Undergoing Abdominal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients admit surgical center day abdominal surgery ( Day 1 , unless admission night require ) . All patient see study staff confirm eligibility , review study procedure , conduct pre-surgical assessment require randomization . Qualified patient randomize 1 3 treatment group , correspond 1 2 dose level intravenous ( IV ) CR845 ( 0.5 1 mcg/kg ) match placebo , respectively . Study drug administer every 6 hour 24-hour post-operative treatment period follow initial 2 drug administration : - Pre-Operative dose : Within one hour prior anesthetic induction surgery . This dose 2X load dose . - Baseline post-operative dose : within 30-minutes consider stable Post-Anesthesia Care Unit ( PACU ) Subsequent dose administer 6 , 12 18 hour . During Treatment Observation Period , pain intensity score obtain specify time point episodes nausea vomit record . Upon request , patient may provide analgesic anti-nausea rescue medication ( restrict morphine ( tolerate ) , ondansetron , respectively ) time Baseline dose study drug administer . Blood sample safety assessment conducted period well . Patients remain hospital Day 3 ( 48-hours surgery ) point evaluate discharge . A follow-up medical evaluation schedule within 7 - 10 day post-surgery .</detailed_description>
