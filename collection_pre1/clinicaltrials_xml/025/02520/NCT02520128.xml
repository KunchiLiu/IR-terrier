	<brief_title>A Study IMRT Primary Bone Soft Tissue Sarcoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>IMRiS prospective multicentre phase II trial Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy ( IMRT ) . The trial aim evaluate role intensity modulate radiotherapy ( IMRT ) soft tissue bone sarcoma . Three separate sarcoma cohort study analysed separately . Patients enrol one three cohort depend type sarcoma : Cohort 1- Patients Limb/limb girdle soft tissue sarcoma receiving ( neo ) -adjuvant radiotherapy . Cohort 2- Patients Ewing sarcoma spine/pelvis receive definitive radical ( neo ) -adjuvant radiotherapy . Cohort 3- Patients non-Ewing primary bone sarcoma spine/pelvis receive definitive radical adjuvant radiotherapy . Dose schedule Cohort indicate Trial Arm description . Radiotherapy deliver fix beam IMRT , arc IMRT technique , tomotherapy . All trial patient follow death maximum three year date registration trial . The theoretical advantage IMRT potential reduction late toxicity subsequent potential functional improvement . There prospective study date power address , particularly IMRT use post-operatively . IMRiS cohort 1 address question establish use IMRT reduce late normal tissue toxicity . In cohort 2 &amp; 3 , aim establish use IMRT enable achievement radiotherapy treatment plan deliver optimal dose keep within normal tissue tolerance . There clinical trial IMRT Ewing sarcoma little publish use IMRT high grade bone sarcoma chordomas . It important establish feasibility IMRT achieve require radiation dose tumour , prospectively document side effect treatment set . IMRiS address cohort 2 cohort 3 .</detailed_description>
