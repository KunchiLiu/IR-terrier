	<brief_summary>To determine effect probiotic supplementation inflammatory response subsequent performance follow muscle damage exercise bout , double-blind , randomize placebo control two-factor repeat measure design employ . The dependent variable study include measure performance well marker inflammation single limb model . Participants qualify study participation height , weight , body composition assess ( skin fold ) follow baseline measurement determination isometric dynamic strength . Initial limb determine randomly . Following baseline test , participant randomly assign ingest either probiotic placebo . Supplementation begin least 24 hour post baseline test . Twenty-one day initiate supplementation , participant complete performance test follow exercise bout know elicit muscle damage produce inflammatory response . Participants repeat performance test 24 , 48 , 72 hour post muscle damage bout . Blood sample determination marker inflammation take throughout study duration . Following 3-week wash-out period ( 21 day ) , participant repeat experiment follow alternate supplement regimen contralateral limb .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effects Probiotic Supplementation Markers Muscle Damage Performance Following Exercise Induced Muscle Damage</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>General Performance Testing Muscle Damaging Exercise Bout Following familiarization consent procedure , participant complete series performance test design determine maximal performance . Those test include test isometric strength dynamic strength elbow flexor . Isometric strength test subject elbow fix angle measurement force subject exerts , dynamic strength test maximal strength specify range motion . Prior baseline testing , participant ask refrain physical activity outside daily live precede 48 hour well eliminate product contain caffeine and/or alcohol . These test repeat course study outline Table 1 examine supplementation probiotic attenuate loss strength follow muscle damage exercise bout . An exercise bout know induce significant muscle damage ( eccentric ) elbow flexor perform Day 22 supplementation . This eccentric base protocol muscle stretch generate force overcome stretch . To avoid carryover effect , initial arm select random contralateral arm use crossover experimental trial . Nutrition Supplementation Following baseline performance measure , participant randomly assign ingest , double blind manner , either probiotic supplement placebo . Participants begin supplementation 24 hour post baseline performance measure ingest supplement ( capsule form ) per day prior consume food . Supplementation continue 25 day ( 21 day prior post measure 4 day post test ) . To ensure compliance , participant report laboratory weekly provide individually wrapped supplement container . Return empty container use verify compliance . In addition , participant complete daily supplement adherence adverse side effect questionnaire ( Appendix ) weekly upon report laboratory . Blood Sampling Inflammatory Markers A baseline blood sample obtain prior performance test supplementation . Further , day muscle damage exercise bout , participant provide blood sample baseline determination inflammatory blood marker muscle damage . Blood sample also take immediately post , 30 , 60 minute post damage exercise bout . Participants return laboratory 24 , 48 , 72 hour follow exercise bout provide additional blood sample . Thirty six milliliter sample time blood drawn . If emergency arise , laboratory protocol emergency management follow . Soreness Swelling Assessment An algometer ass deep muscle pain trigger point tenderness biceps muscle result muscle damage . The investigator apply pressure algometer point muscle . The pressure threshold measurement consist follow step . First , follow explanation give participant : ' I go measure pressure threshold ; , much pressure induce discomfort . I go increase pressure slowly device . Say `` Yes '' start feel pain discomfort . I stop pressure soon say `` Yes '' , hurt . It important understand test sensitivity , test endurance . Do understand question ? ' After explanation give , algometer place exactly indelible mark perpendicular muscle observation . Pressure increase continuously 1 kg per second participant say 'Yes ' . At time , pressure stop , meter remove skin , measurement record . The mean 1 measurement take 3 site record pressure pain threshold . The subject blind pressure pain measurement . Additionally , rest angle arm measure along arm circumference determine degree swell .</detailed_description>
