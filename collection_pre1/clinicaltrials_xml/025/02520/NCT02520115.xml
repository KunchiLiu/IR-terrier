	<brief_title>Folate Receptor Diagnosing Ovarian Cancer Using Serum Samples From Patients With Newly Diagnosed Pelvic Mass Previously Diagnosed Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate pre- post-induction correlation soluble folate receptor tumor-based receptor level marker malignancy patient newly diagnose adnexal mass . ( Arm I ) II . To evaluate ability induce serum folate receptor ( FR ) dexamethasone ( Dex ) valproic acid ( VPA ) treatment patient newly diagnose adnexal mass . ( Arm I ) III . To evaluate use serum soluble FR marker earlier detection recurrent disease . ( Arm II ) IV . To evaluate ability induce FR Dex VPA set recurrent disease . ( Arm II ) SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate expression FR primary versus ( vs. ) metastatic tumor sit patient ovarian malignancy undergo Dex VPA induction correlate expression marker associate malignancy ( marker proliferation Ki-67 [ Ki67 ] , cancer antigen [ CA ] -125 , etc. ) . II . To analyze correlation gluco-corticoid receptor ( GR ) level serum FR induction efficacy . III . To examine global , downstream target GR FR induction patient sample undergo treatment Dex VPA . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 2 arm . ARM I ( INDUCTION ) : Patients receive valproic acid orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day -7 -3 daily ( QD ) day -2 dexamethasone PO QD day -5 -2 BID day -4 -3 . Patients undergo collection serum tissue sample analysis via polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) immunohistochemistry ( IHC ) baseline , time surgery , 7-14 day surgery . ARM II ( SURVEILLANCE AND RECURRENCE ) : Patients receive valproic acid PO BID day -7 -3 QD day -2 dexamethasone PO QD day -5 -2 BID day -4 -3 . Patients undergo collection serum tissue sample analysis via PCR IHC time clinically suspect recurrence , 2 day completion induction , 7-14 day induction .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>For study Arm 1 , female subject childbearing potential less 2 year postmenopausal agree use acceptable form contraception time sign informed consent 30 day study completion unless total hysterectomy perform time original operation Able provide inform consent Performance status Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) 02 Study Arm 1 : primary diagnosis pelvic adnexal mass presume gynecologic origin schedule operative resection Study Arm 2 : previously diagnose nonmucinous epithelial ovarian carcinoma ( include serous , clear cell , endometrioid histology well borderline ovarian tumor ) currently undergo routine surveillance recurrence , diagnose recurrence prior initiation chemotherapy . . Patients Study Arm 1 automatically include Study Arm 2 well unless withdraw consent . Finally , patient diagnose ovarian cancer acceptable histology yet initiate adjuvant chemotherapy eligible Study Arm 2 . Known sarcomatous histology Current usage VPA Dex , patient medication past currently take still candidate study . Prior use must great one month VPA . There `` wash '' period require DEX . Any contraindication dexamethasone valproic acid know allergy sensitivity Unable give inform consent Pregnancy Greater 3 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) Greater 3 x ULN total bilirubin ( except know case Gilbert 's syndrome , level conjugate bilirubin must less 3 x ULN ) Greater 1.5 x ULN blood urea nitrogen ( BUN ) Greater 1.5 x ULN creatinine Chronic acute pancreatitis evidence clinical pathologic diagnosis Significant acute chronic medical , neurologic , psychiatric illness subject , judgment Investigator , could compromise subject safety , limit subject 's ability complete study , and/or compromise objective study For study Arm 2 , patient currently undergo chemotherapy recurrence ; maintenance chemotherapy consider exclusion criterion . Additionally , note patient yet begin chemotherapy recurrence adjuvant chemotherapy initial diagnosis still candidate enrol Study arm .</criteria>
