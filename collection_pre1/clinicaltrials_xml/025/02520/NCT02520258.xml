	<brief_summary>Experiments show artificial sweetener like diet soda cause change body respond uses sugar . These change increase chance obesity , type 2 diabetes , metabolic disease . In study , investigator plan see common artificial sweetener , aspartame ( brand name Equal , NutraSweet ) , cause change . The investigator believe metabolic change observe person consumes aspartame , remove aspartame diet might lead reversal change normalization test results.This would impact sweetener additive food thus decrease incidence obesity , diabetes , metabolic syndrome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Experiments show artificial sweetener like diet soda cause change body respond uses sugar . These change increase chance obesity , type 2 diabetes mellitus , metabolic disease . In study , investigator plan see commonly use artificial sweetener , aspartame , affect body 's response sugar . The investigator believe metabolic change observe person consumes aspartame , remove aspartame diet might lead reversal change normalization test result . The investigator plan study two ( 2 ) cohort healthy volunteer : 1 ) Those regularly drink least three can per day diet soda contains aspartame ( Cohort 1 , Aspartame Consumers ) 2 ) participant consume less equal two ( 2 ) can diet soda per week ( Cohort 2 , Aspartame Naïve Participants ) . Phase I study , investigator ask participant question usual diet , include much diet soda usually drink . Participants screen test call oral glucose tolerance test , OGTT . This test involve come hospital drink sugary syrup , blood sugar check every thirty ( 30 ) minute five ( 5 ) hour . Before test , participant must refrain eat drink anything ten ( 10 ) hour . If OGTT show high value , participant cohort 1 ( Aspartame Consumers ) regularly drink 3 can per day diet soda approach continue second phase study . For participant cohort 2 ( consume less equal two ( 2 ) can diet soda per week ; Aspartame Naïve Participants ) , end participation study . Phase II study , blood test , OGTT , stool sample , weight body fat measurement time week track change participant study . During phase II five ( 5 ) week study , participant receive meal Rockefeller University Hospital outside food drink . The diet use throughout study phase ( II ) Prudent Metabolic Diet . Participants leave hospital continue work , must come test receive meal . During Week One , participants eat food provide hospital continue drink three ( 3 ) can diet soda per day . In Weeks Two Four , participant continue eat food give hospital allow consume food drink contain aspartame . In Week Five , participant continue hospital diet , start drink three ( 3 ) can diet soda per day .</detailed_description>
