	<brief_title>Anti-ICOS Monoclonal Antibody MEDI-570 Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma Follicular Variant Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety , maximum tolerate dose recommended phase II dose ( RP2D ) MEDI-570 ( anti-ICOS monoclonal antibody MEDI-570 ) patient refractory/relapsed peripheral T-cell lymphoma ( PTCL ) follicular variant angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma ( AITL ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate pharmacokinetic profile MEDI-570 . II . To evaluate overall response rate ( ORR ) progression free survival ( PFS ) MEDI-570 dose level 10-patient expansion cohort maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) . III . To determine short long term effect MEDI-570 dose level immune system T-cell lymphocyte subset . IV . To determine relationship ICOS expression tumor cell response MEDI-570 . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate biomarkers response resistance MEDI-570 study population . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive anti-ICOS monoclonal antibody MEDI-570 intravenously ( IV ) 1-4 hour day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 12 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 6 week 12 week .</detailed_description>
