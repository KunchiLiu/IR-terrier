	<brief_title>Pembrolizumab Combination With Chemotherapy Frontline Ovarian Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Treatment : If participant find eligible take part study agree , schedule surgery , standard chemotherapy , chemotherapy combination pembrolizumab . Participant receive standard chemotherapy treatment three 21-day cycle : - On Day 1 cycle , participant receive carboplatin vein 1 hour . - On Days 1 , 8 , 15 cycle , participant receive paclitaxel vein 3 hour . Participant schedule surgery . Some tissue remove surgery use immune system test compare tissue collect chemotherapy . After participant recover surgery ( 3-6 week later ) , begin receive chemotherapy along drug pembrolizumab . Participant receive standard chemotherapy way receive Cycles 1-3 . - On Day 1 cycle , participant receive pembrolizumab vein 30 minute Cycles 4-26 . Cycles 7-26 call Maintenance Phase . - Participant receive carboplatin paclitaxel Cycles 4-6 . Study Visits On Day 1 Cycles 1-3 : - Participant physical exam . If study doctor think need , participant also pelvic exam . - Blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) collect routine test check participant 's blood sugar level . On Days 1 , 8 15 Cycles 1-6 , blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . On Day 1 Cycles 4-26 : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) draw check participant 's thyroid function routine test . - Urine collect routine test . Every 3 cycle , participant CT scan MRI check status disease . Length Study : Participant receive study drug ( ) 23 cycle . Participant longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . After participant longer take study drug , study staff continue call every 3 month check status health . Post-Treatment Visits : After last dose study drug ( ) , follow test procedure perform : - Participant physical exam . - Participant CT MRI check status disease . - Blood ( 1-2 tablespoon ) draw routine test . About 30 day last dose study drug , participant physical exam . This investigational study . Pembrolizumab FDA-approved commercially available treatment certain type melanoma . Its use participant ovarian cancer investigational . Carboplatin paclitaxel FDA-approved commercially available treatment advance ovarian cancer . The study doctor explain study drug combination design work . Up 30 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
