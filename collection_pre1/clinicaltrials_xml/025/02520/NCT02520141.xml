	<brief_title>Ramucirumab Advanced Pre-treated Biliary Cancers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Drug Administration : If participant find eligible take part study , receive ramucirumab vein 60 minute Day 1 14-day study cycle . Study visit : On Day 1 cycle : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . On Day 1 every 2 cycle , blood ( 1 tablespoon ) drawn tumor marker test . Tumor marker may relate status disease . On Day 1 Cycle 4 every 4 cycle ( Cycles 8 , 12 , 16 , ) , participant CT scan MRI check status disease . Length Treatment : Participant may continue take study drug long doctor think best interest . Participant longer able take study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . Patient 's participation study follow-up . Follow-Up Visits : Within 10 day participant 's last dose study drug : - Participant physical exam . - Blood ( 2 tablespoon ) urine collect routine test . - If participant one last 4 week , CT scan MRI check status disease . About 30 day participant 's last dose study drug , one last 4 week , CT scan MRI check status disease . If participant able come MD Anderson Day 30 follow-up visit , contact phone ask feeling . Every 3 month 30-day visit , participant contact phone medical record check monitor health . This investigational study . Ramucirumab FDA approve commercially available treatment colorectal cancer , gastric cancer , non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . It consider investigational use ramucirumab treat biliary cancer . The study doctor explain study drug design work . Up 50 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
