	<detailed_description>Background : Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( HCM ) autosomal dominant disease characterize unexplained hypertrophy leave ventricle , often predominant involvement interventricular septum , characterize myocyte disarray fibrosis . HCM common familial heart disease strong genetic heterogeneity , demonstrate past 20 year . Mutations 11 gene encode protein cardiac sarcomere responsible ( associate ) HCM . However , 30-40 % sporadic familial case HCM still genetically unlabelled . In addition , secondary HCM cause Fabry 's disease amyloidosis , may mimic primary HCM may diagnose . This may result delay accurate diagnosis instauration specific treatment , possible clinical consequence patient . Objectives : For reason , decide apply new diagnostic strategy patient newly diagnose HCM , include whole exome sequencing ( WES ) technology . 1 . Main objective : evaluate additional diagnostic value new propose strategy identification specific cause HCM compare conventional diagnostic strategy 2 . Secondary objective : To evaluate frequency secondary HCM ( Fabry 's disease , amyloidosis , mitochondrial cardiomyopathy , others ) observe systematic screen population newly diagnose HCM Perspectives : If correctly apply , new technology potential strongly reduce diagnostic wavering lead early diagnosis genetic counseling sarcomeric HCM rarer form secondary HCM include Fabry 's disease amyloidosis , also specific therapy set-up secondary form HCM . It also allow identify new gene responsible HCM .</detailed_description>
