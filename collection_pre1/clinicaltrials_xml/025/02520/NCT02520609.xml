	<brief_summary>Background : Metabolism refers many chemical pathway various compound , include food , process use body . People non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) much fat liver cell , cause unclear . One explanation people NAFLD process food metabolize differently people without NAFLD . Researchers want compare food metabolize people without NAFLD . Objective : To good understand food intake influence development progression NAFLD . Eligibility : People age 18 old NAFLD non-NAFLD metabolic syndrome Healthy volunteer age 18 old Design : Participants screen medical history , survey , physical exam , blood test . This ultrasound abdomen . This use sound wave image internal organ . Participants stay Clinical Center 2 night . They fast first night . On second day : Have metabolism monitor metabolism research room 24 hour Have catheter insert arm vein several blood test Drink Ensure Plus breakfast Have solid meal lunch dinner Have several urine test . The final morning , : Have blood test . Have DXA test measure fat body . They lie back 15-25 minute x-ray machine position area body .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Dynamic Post-Prandial Metabolism Patients With Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) common hepatic disorder Western world , lead cause liver-related morbidity mortality . Excessive caloric intake specific nutritional component implicate pathogenesis , complex metabolic pathway link nutrient consumption hepatic fat accumulation yet fully elucidate . Analysis pathophysiology search biomarkers NAFLD largely focus fasting sample ; dynamic response caloric load interrogate , beyond glucose tolerance test . Metabolomics novel high-throughput technique , allow simultaneous detection hundred thousand metabolite , evaluation interconnectivity causal relationship . We propose pilot study investigate metabolic response patient NAFLD standardize food challenge , apply metabolomics-based dynamic approach . In study recruit 50 patient NAFLD compare 12 control metabolic syndrome without NAFLD , 12 healthy control . Following overnight fast , subject situate metabolic chamber continuous measurement metabolic rate , give liquid mixed meal contain approximately 30 % daily caloric requirement period 15 minute . The energy expenditure ( EE ) respiratory quotient ( RQ ) , reflect preference carbohydrate fat oxidation , measure 1-minute resolution . Blood drawn baseline , 30 min , 1 , 2 , 4 24 hour ingestion . Plasma separate store -80 ( Infinite ) C. Following completion recruitment , store sample analyze NCI Laboratory Metabolism LC/MS GC/MS , metabolites interest identify , individual metabolite quantitated normalized pre-prandial level . Study result hopefully identify novel metabolic marker disease , uncover alter signal pathway unique NAFLD activate primarily feed state condition .</detailed_description>
