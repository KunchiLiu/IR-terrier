	<criteria>Subjects must meet follow inclusion criterion : 1 . Age 20 year old . 2 . Symptomatic moderatetosevere ( 3+ ) severe MR ( 4+ ) chronic Degenerative Mitral Regurgitation ( DMR ) Functional Mitral Regurgitation ( FMR ) determine assessment qualify transthoracic echocardiogram ( TTE ) obtain within 90 day transesophageal echocardiogram ( TEE ) obtain within180 day prior subject registration , MR severity base principally TTE study confirm ECL . The ECL may request TEE . 3 . Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction ( LVEF ) ≥ 30％ within 90 day prior subject registration , assess site use one follow method : echocardiography , contrast leave ventriculography , gate blood pool scan cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) . Note : The method must provide quantitative readout ( visual assessment ) . 4 . New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) classification class II , class III , ambulatory class IV . 5 . Subject deem difficult mitral valve surgery due either Society Thoracic Surgery ( STS ) surgical mortality risk mitral valve replacement ≥ 8 % OR due presence one follow risk factor : Porcelain aorta mobile ascend aortic atheroma Postradiation mediastinum Previous mediastinitis Functional MR LVEF &lt; 40 % Over 75 year old LVEF &lt; 40 % Reoperation patent graft Two prior cardiothoracic surgery Hepatic cirrhosis Other surgical risk factor ( ) 6 . Mitral valve area ≥ 4.0 cm2 assess ECL base TTE within 90 day prior subject registration . The ECL may request TEE . 7 . Left Ventricular End Systolic Dimension ( LVESD ) ≤ 60mm assess site base TTE obtain within 90 day prior subject registration . 8 . The primary regurgitant jet noncommissural base TEE , opinion AVJ514 implant investigator successfully treat AVJ514 . If secondary jet exists , must consider clinically insignificant . 9 . Transseptal catheterization femoral vein access determine feasible treat physician . 10 . The subject subject 's legal representative inform nature study agree provision provide write informed consent approve Institutional Review Board respective clinical site . Subjects must meet follow exclusion criterion : 1 . LVEF &lt; 30 % 2 . Leaflet anatomy may preclude AVJ514 implantation , proper position leaflet sufficient reduction MR AVJ514 base . This evaluation base TEE evaluation mitral valve within 180 day prior subject registration include : Insufficient mobile leaflet available grasp AVJ514 device Lack primary secondary chordal support grasp area Evidence significant calcification grasp area Presence significant cleave grasp area 3 . Life expectancy &lt; 1 year due associate noncardiac comorbid condition 4 . Need emergent urgent surgery reason 5 . Prior open heart mitral valve leaflet surgery currently implant prosthetic mitral valve prior transcatheter mitral valve procedure . 6 . Echocardiographic evidence intracardiac mass , thrombus vegetation . 7 . Active endocarditis active rheumatic heart disease leaflet degenerate rheumatic disease ( i.e . noncompliant , perforate ) . 8 . Untreated clinically significant coronary artery disease require revascularization significant myocardial ischemia evidence acute myocardial infarction prior 90 day registration . 9 . Cerebrovascular accident within 180 day prior registration 10 . Severe symptomatic carotid stenosis ( &gt; 70 % ultrasound ) 11 . Any cardiac surgery within 180 day prior registration 12 . Percutaneous coronary intervention ( PCI ) within last 30 day prior registration 13 . Implant Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy ( CRT ) , Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy Cardioverter Defibrillator ( CRTD ) pacemaker Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator ( ICD ) within last 30 day prior registration . 14 . Transcatheter aortic valve replacement ( TAVR ) within last 30 day prior registration . 15 . Severe tricuspid regurgitation aortic valve disease require surgical treatment . 16 . In judgment Investigator , femoral vein accommodate 24 F catheter presence ipsilateral deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) . 17 . Hemodynamic instability define systolic pressure &lt; 90 mmHg without afterload reduction drug cardiogenic shock intraaortic balloon pump . 18 . History bleed diathesis coagulopathy subject refuse blood transfusion . 19 . Active infection require current antibiotic therapy ( temporary illness , patient may enroll least 14 day discontinuation antibiotic ) . Patients must free infection prior treatment . Any required dental work complete minimum 21 day prior treatment . 20 . Intravenous drug abuse suspect inability adhere followup . 21 . Patients TEE contraindicate . 22 . A known hypersensitivity contraindication study procedure medication adequately manage medically . 23 . In judgment Investigator , subject presence permanent pacemaker pace lead would interfere placement test device placement test device would disrupt lead . 24 . Subject intend participate investigational invasive clinical study within period 1 year follow AVJ514 procedure . 25 . Currently participate investigational drug another device study complete primary endpoint clinically interfere current study endpoint . ( Note : Trials require extend followup product investigational , since become commercially available , consider investigational trial ) . 26 . In opinion investigator designee , subject unable comply requirement study protocol unsuitable study reason . 27 . In opinion anesthesiologist , general anesthesia contraindicate . 28 .
