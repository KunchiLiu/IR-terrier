	<brief_summary>This phase Ib trial study side effect best dose osimertinib navitoclax give together see well work treat patient previously treat epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) -positive non-small cell lung cancer spread place body respond previous treatment initial EGFR kinase inhibitor . Osimertinib navitoclax may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Giving osimertinib together navitoclax may work good treat EGFR-positive non-small cell lung cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Osimertinib Navitoclax Treating Patients With EGFR-Positive Previously Treated Advanced Metastatic Non-small Cell Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety tolerability AZD9291 ( osimertinib ) combination navitoclax patient EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) follow resistance prior EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( EGFR TKI ) . II . To evaluate feasibility treatment AZD9291 plus navitoclax patient T790M-mediated acquire resistance EGFR TKI . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To study pharmacokinetic profile combination AZD9291 plus navitoclax . II . To observe record anti-tumor activity . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To study plasma genotype level response biomarker patient EGFR-mutant lung cancer . II . To explore tissue biomarkers apoptosis association treatment response . OUTLINE : This phase Ib , dose-escalation study follow dose-expansion study . Patients receive navitoclax orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 osimertinib PO QD day 4-28 ( day 1-28 dose-expansion ) . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
