	<brief_summary>This research study evaluate use specialize test solid tumor include sequence . The process perform specialized test call tumor profiling . The tumor profiling may result identify change gene tumor indicate particular therapy may activity . This call individualized cancer therapy ( iCat ) recommendation . The result tumor profiling , applicable , iCat recommendation return .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The iCat2 , GAIN Consortium Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients solid tumor high risk recurrence already recur become refractory standard treatment eligible participate study . All enrol patient target sequence tumor perform . Sequencing result review clinically significant finding include determination whether mutation exist suggest potential activity target therapy ( iCat recommendation ) . Results return patient 's oncologist follow-up data collect . In prospective multi-center cohort study , primary objective describe outcome pediatric patient advance solid tumor accord whether receive targeted therapy match iCat recommendation . The primary clinical outcome interest endpoint overall survival ( OS ) , progression-free survival response rate ( RR ) key secondary clinical outcome measure . To address hypothesis , 825 patient enroll anticipate 11 participate institution 3 year .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Age Age ≤ 30 year time initial qualify solid tumor diagnosis Diagnosis Histologic diagnosis solid malignancy ( exclude brain tumor lymphoma ) meet least one follow criterion : Refractory , define tumor progression initiation standard first line therapy without achieve prior partial complete remission OR Biopsy proven residual disease completion plan standard initial frontline therapy . Recurrent , define tumor progression achieve prior partial complete remission Newly diagnose high risk disease , define expect event free survival &lt; 50 % 2 year . Specimen Samples Sufficient tumor specimen available meet minimum requirement profile diagnosis progression / recurrence OR Surgery / biopsy plan part clinical care anticipated yield sufficient material meet minimum requirement profile ; OR Patient already molecular profile demonstrate potentially targetable variant laboratory certify generate clinical report , patient yet start therapy match variant AND sufficient tumor specimen available meet minimum requirement profile procedure tissue prior test perform . No Therapy Planned Patients decline anticancer therapy exclude . Performance Status Patients Lansky ( age &lt; 16 year ) Karnofsky ( age ≥16 year ) score &lt; 50 exclude . Life Expectancy Patients anticipated life expectancy &lt; 3 month exclude .</criteria>
