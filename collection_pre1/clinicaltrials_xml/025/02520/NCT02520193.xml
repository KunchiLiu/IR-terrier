	<brief_summary>The purpose present study compare usual care term mobilization perform intubated ICU patient standardized program design deliver early mobilization least 5 day week . This study / design control group experimental phase . The first phase study correspond observational phase every act mobilization perform included patient go documented . During first study period , total duration mechanical ventilation go recorded patient include . At end first study period , participate ICU go randomize ( Cluster randomization ) two group either observational experimental . The corresponding strategy go applied patient include second study period . During second period , total duration mechanical ventilation also go record patient include . The study hypothesis apply protocolized early mobilization strategy increase number ventilator free-days 28 day intubation ICU patient .</brief_summary>
