The ED-to-home transition identify cause avoidable poor outcome , ED-focused intervention improve transition inconclusive outcome suffer feasibility , sustainability scalability problem . Coleman 's Care Transition Intervention ( CTI ) validate improve hospital-to-home transition , decrease hospital readmission cost . The CTI use coach , usually nurse social worker , support patient discharge home transferring skill activate patient . Applying CTI ED-to-home transition natural extension , evaluate unique demand set . In study , investigator test hypothesis community-based , paramedic-coordinated ED-to-home CTI improve community-dwelling older adult ' post-ED health outcome reduce cost . The investigator evaluate CTI process outcome test participant randomize CTI demonstrate well understand red flag indicate worsen condition , implement medication change frequently , follow primary care physician rapidly ED discharge , compare control group . The investigator also evaluate effectiveness cost-effectiveness CTI test participant randomize CTI improved Patient Activation Measure score 30 day discharge , decreased frequency ED use , decrease health care cost within 30 day ED discharge . Additionally , investigator recognize CTI eliminate repeat ED visit . Thus , identify factor independently associate repeat ED visit among CTI recipient future program ensure need adequately address . This research provide critical empiric evidence regard significant problem poor ED-to-home transition . By leverage CTI , widely available efficient intervention paramedic , highly-skilled respect health care provider present community , investigator apply innovative approach improve old adult ' health follow ED visit . Through rigorous research , test effectiveness cost-effectiveness approach , specific focus ultimate sustainability dissemination .</detailed_description>
