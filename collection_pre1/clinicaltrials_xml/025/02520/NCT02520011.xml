	<brief_title>Alvocidib Biomarker-driven Phase 2 AML Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Stage 1 study , eligible AML patient demonstrate NOXA BH3 prim ≥ 40 % mitochondrial profile bone marrow receive treatment alvocidib , cytarabine mitoxantrone [ ACM ( 'FLAM ' ) regimen ] . In Stage 2 , eligible AML patient demonstrate NOXA BH3 prim ≥ 40 % mitochondrial profile bone marrow randomize 1:1 receive either treatment ACM CM ( cytarabine mitoxantrone ) . In exploratory arm , eligible patient newly diagnose high-risk AML NOXA BH3 prim ≥40 % mitochondrial profile bone marrow receive treatment ACM .</detailed_description>
