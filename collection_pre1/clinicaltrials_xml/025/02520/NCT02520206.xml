	<brief_summary>The investigator propose conduct translational study regulation S-adenosylmethionine synthesis cellular methylation reaction chronic inflammation . Development vitro cell model may reveal regulatory mechanism specific inflammatory mediator cause metabolic change alter DNA methylation status . Metabolic pharmacological study vivo model enable u good understand regulation inter-organ homeostasis S-adenosyl methionine help identify tissue specific biomarkers methylation epigenetic modification different stage chronic inflammation . The clinical study human subject help distinguish impact autoimmune rheumatic disease , degenerate joint disease , specific medication use significant clinical biochemical marker folate vitamin B6 metabolic pathways.The Investigators hope present study identify specific clinical marker potential epigenetic change patient suffer chronic inflammation , contribute good clinical management disease human .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The significance epigenetic alteration autoimmune rheumatic disease degenerate joint disease draw great attention among clinician researcher . Aberrant methylation status demonstrate human chronic inflammation yet effort focus global sequence-specific hypomethylation overexpression specific gene . Few study investigate regulation S-adenosylmethionine homeostasis regulation inflammation . At present relevance regulation complex epigenetic profile modification among different tissue organ inflammation remain largely unknown .</detailed_description>
