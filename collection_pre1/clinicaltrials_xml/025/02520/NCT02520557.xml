	<brief_summary>The purpose study understand people certain gene predispose develop severe skin reaction administer Eslicarbazepine Acetate . Currently information suggest certain individual use Eslicarbazepine Acetate predispose develop severe skin reaction . However , previous research show seizure medicine like carbamazepine ( Tegretol® ) oxcarbazepine ( Trileptal® , Oxtellar XR® ) likely cause severe drug relate skin reaction people Asian ancestry specific gene . These gene find area chromosome call Major Histocompatibility Complex . This association call genetic risk factor . The study objective compare information obtain individual history seizure disorder develop severe skin reaction use Eslicarbazepine Acetate group patient also history seizure disorder history severe skin reaction use Eslicarbazepine Acetate .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study genetic case-control study conduct United States . In case-control study , case condition interest ( case , individual SCAR [ severe cutaneous adverse reaction ] initiate ESL ) ; control , individual know condition interest ( case ESL user without SCAR ) , identify . Cases individual document definite probable Stevens-Johnson syndrome ( SJS ) , toxic epidermal necrolysis ( TEN ) , acute generalize exanthematous pustulosis ( AGEP ) , drug reaction eosinophilia systemic symptom ( DRESS ) symptom onset consistent one condition within first 4 month use ESL ( include 14 day discontinue ESL ) , ascertain PPD Pharmacovigilance ( PVG ) ( Sponsor CRO ) . Controls individual use ESL least 6 week develop SCAR match genetic ancestry classification ratio 10 control per case . Controls collect prospectively , pool ESL-tolerant patient identify independently collection case . Controls select among : - Ongoing subject clinical study ESL ; - Patients prescribed ESL may ask participate neurologist high-prescribing practice high ethnic diversity . Blood saliva sample genotyping ancestry marker ( match control case ) sequence HLA region collect case control subject provide consent participation genetic study . In addition , blood sample request subject assess relationship specific viral marker .</detailed_description>
