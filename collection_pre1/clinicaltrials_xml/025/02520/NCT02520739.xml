	<detailed_description>The Mediterranean diet , olive oil main source fat , show protective chronic degenerative disease . These disease , cardiovascular , cancer , neurodegenerative , even age process , link oxidative stress inflammation . Recently , Prevention Mediterranean Diet Study provide first time evidence benefit Mediterranean diet primary prevention cardiovascular disease . In human , randomize , control study olive oil , particularly virgin one rich phenolic compound , show provide benefit oxidative damage , inflammation , generation cell adhesion molecule , key process atherosclerosis development . Olive oil , besides high content healthy fat , monounsaturated ( MUFA ) one : oleic acid , minor component bioactive property . The minor component virgin olive oil classify two type : unsaponifiable fraction , define fraction extract solvent saponification oil , soluble fraction include phenolic compound . The content phenolic compound ( polyphenols ) olive oil depend variety olive fruit , cultivar , climate , ripeness olive , type processing . Virgin olive oil obtain first press centrifugation olives high phenolic content . On November 2011 , European Food Safety Authority ( EFSA , 2011 ) release claim concern benefit daily ingestion olive oil rich phenolic compound , virgin olive oil . The Panel considers order bear claim , 5 mg hydroxytyrosol derivative ( e.g . oleuropein complex tyrosol ) olive oil consume daily . These quantity , provide moderate amount olive oil , easily consume context balance diet ( EFSA , 2011 ) . The condition use claim bottle , regulate Commission Regulation ( EU ) .NÂº 432/2012 16 May 2012 ( Official Journal European Union , L136/1 . 25 , 5 , 2012 ) . According regulation : `` The claim may use olive oil contains least 5 mg hydroxytyrosol derivative ( e.g . oleuropein complex tyrosol ) per 20 g olive oil . In order bear claim , information shall give consumer beneficial effect obtain daily intake 20 g olive oil '' . This imply high phenolic content olive oil bear claim . Due , need optimize olive oil processing order obtain high phenolic content olive oil one current goal term increase nutritional value olive oil . To obtain optimized olive oil high phenolic content ( OHPCO ) one achievement within frame NUTRAOLEOUM Project . In sense must point , among minor olive oil component , polyphenols , component unsaponifiable fraction triterpenes also show potential provide benefit health . The seed skin olive , use produce pomace olive oil , rich triterpenes . Pomace olive oil triterpenes , oleanolic maslinic acid , show anti-inflammatory , antioxidant , vasodilatation property cellular animal model . Due , enrichment OHPCO olive triterpenes , join healthy property virgin pomace olive oil , result Functional Olive Oil ( FOO ) high bioactive potential health . This FOO also develop frame NUTRAOLEUM Project . Consumers every day ask `` add value '' nutritional property food purchase response Olive Oil Industry need . However , healthy property new olive oil ( OHPCO FOO ) , accord Evidence Based Medicine must test proper clinical randomize trial . New olive oil product need test front parental one ( i.e . virgin olive oil obtain common procedure ) order ensure healthy property highlight . This purpose NUTRAOLEUM Study . In order able obtain future health claim EFSA FDA , product , also examine bioavailability human active principle ( phenolic compound triterpenes ) olive oil , well possible basic mechanism involve potential health benefit olive oil test .</detailed_description>
