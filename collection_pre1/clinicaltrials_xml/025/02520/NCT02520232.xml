	<brief_summary>Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) irreversible , progressive brain disease . It common form dementia major cause functional dependence elderly . Since currently cure Alzheimer 's disease , grow number scientist point interest use non-pharmacological alternative therapeutic approach order slow decline physical cognitive resource improve quality life patient Alzheimer 's disease . Several narrative meta-analytical review suggest regular practice physical activity delay occurrence cognitive decline slow Alzheimer 's disease progress compare sedentary people . Despite grow interest scientific community positive effect chronic exercise mental health cognitive function , clinical reality phenomenon remain clearly establish , particularly age people suffer neurodegenerative diseases.The first aim research project test chronic exercise reduces even compensates cognitive decline patient prodromal Alzheimer 's disease ( i.e. , dementia ) age people pathology central nervous system . The second aim research project examine whether increase cerebral blood flow induce chronic exercise explain positive effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Several epidemiologic study conduct North America Europe show regular practice physical activity , opposition sedentary life , associate reduce risk develop neurodegenerative disease AD . These result strengthen cross-sectional interventional study , show physical activity slow decline cognitive function typically observe normal pathological aging retard onset dementia . The positive effect chronic exercise cerebral cognitive age recognised scientist clinician ; however , mechanism underlie effect human poorly understood real need randomise control trial ( RCT ) topic . The objective research project understand compensatory mechanism may account positive effect regular physical activity pathological non-pathological cerebral age human particular people present prodromal AD . All participant separate six group correspond combination two independent variable : population type ( age people without neurological disease vs. prodromal Alzheimer 's disease participant ) type physical activity program follow six month ( aerobic strength exercise program , stretch balance program , maintain sedentary life style ) . Cognitive performance , cardiovascular health , brain integrity cerebral functioning assess two three different time : onset training program ( pre-test ) , end training period ( post-test 1 ) six month end train program ( post-test 2 ) .</detailed_description>
