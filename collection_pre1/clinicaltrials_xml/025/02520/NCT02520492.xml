	<brief_summary>In patient risk increase intracranial pressure ( ICP ) , ICP measurement require invasive transducer , usually insertion catheter cranium , spinal tap . These invasive modality involve risk pain do specialized care unit , high associate cost . A novel method detecting change ICP develop recently . The auditory hair cell emit sound electric signal response sound , easily detect measure non-invasively help microphone probe place external ear canal regular electrode . Indeed , cochlear aqueduct connects cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) space inner ear way ICP inner-ear fluid pressure equalize within second . A symptom intracranial pressure ( ICP ) observe glioma patient due combination cause : inflammatory reaction around tumor , mass effect tumor , secondary vascular change , change flow CSF . The evaluation intracranial hypertension increase ICP ( invasive ) use monitor intracranial tumor . It detect use routine clinical sign , combination standard image method ( MRI ) , still subjective . The measurement noninvasive ICP could allow early detection relapse , evaluate whether increase ICP precede tumor clinical worsening / imaging .</brief_summary>
