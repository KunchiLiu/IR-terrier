	<brief_title>An Innovative Treatment Fistula-in-ano Crohn Disease : Local Micro Reinjection Autologous Fat SVF</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Crohn 's disease chronic inflammation part digestive tract , `` mouth anus `` . Anoperineal lesion frequent entity disease ( 20 80 % ) real therapeutic challenge . Among lesion , interested fistula-in-ano currently difficult treat despite large therapeutic arsenal . Cell therapy new promising approach treatment inflammatory disease include Crohn 's disease fistula . Indeed , stem cell show efficacy several indication differentiation potential , include fistula-in-ano Crohn 's disease . Adipose tissue seem ideal source cell therapy This prospective , open , non-comparative , single center , phase I-II clinical trial . It involve 10 patient conducted period 28 month . This protocol design evaluate , patient Crohn 's disease fistula-in-ano refractory conventional medical surgical treatment , safety efficacy local microinjection autologous adipose tissue SVF microaspirate . The main objective ass tolerance security . The secondary objective evaluate effectiveness technique Microaspiration perform plastic surgeon general anesthesia . He perform two type fat removal : sample 120 cc wich send laboratory cell therapy obtain SVF ( 5 cc ) sample 30 cc . Once treatment obtain ( SVF + adipose tissue ) administer patient local mico reinjection ( SVF ) around ( adipose tissue ) fistula . This administration make surgeon second general anesthesia view fistula removal seton . Then patient monitor regular consultation week 1 , 2 , 8 , 16 et 48 paraclinical ( blood sample magnetic resonance image perineum ) week 8 48 evaluate tolerance effectiveness treatment . At end study , result expect effectiveness local micro reinjection autologous adipose tissue SVF treatment refractory fistula-in-ano Crohn 's disease .</detailed_description>
