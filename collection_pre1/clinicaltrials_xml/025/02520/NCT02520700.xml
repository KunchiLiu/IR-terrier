	<brief_title>A Comparison White-light Daylight Topical Methyl 5-aminolaevulinic Acid Photodynamic Therapy Actinic Keratoses</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Summary : Title : A Randomized Single-blinded , Prospective Study compare Maquet PWD 50SF theatre-light light source natural daylight application photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) treat actinic keratoses . Photodynamic therapy ( PDT ) proven efficacy treatment actinic keratosis ( AK ) increasingly use internationally . It involve topical application 5-aminolaevulinic acid cream ( ALA ) methyl ester methyl 5-aminolaevulinic acid ( MAL ) , absorb AK convert photosensitize compound protoporphyrin IX . When AK expose visible light oxygen dependent photochemical reaction induce result cell death apoptosis necrosis . Pain main limiting factor PDT . Recently researcher use natural daylight source visible light photodynamic therapy , process call daylight PDT . This find equally effective conventional PDT less painful . Patients prefer treatment option fact Copenhagen , routinely offer daylight PDT April October , find patient frequently opt defer treatment time year daylight PDT option . The drawback perform daylight PDT Ireland climate , term cloud cover temperature . The typical daylight treatment time 2 hour would difficult patient stay outside winter , spring autumn . This study investigate use artificial white light source alternative . It known light dose require effectively treat AK 's , study daylight PDT Copenhagen find difference treatment outcome 8 J cm-2 . The pain experience PDT may relate accumulation PpIX short accumulation time 30 minute use daylight PDT may account reduction pain experience daylight PDT . With PpIX photography demonstrate daylight PDT ( incubation 30 min ) almost accumulation PpIX occur yet local reaction ( erythema erosion ) clinical response indicate photodynamic reaction take place . Perhaps key tolerability efficacy daylight PDT allow much PpIX accumulate . The reduction pain efficacy may result continuous activation small quantity PpIX . It known study look PpIX accumulation psoriasis PpIX still identify skin 14 day application ALA . If patient spends time outdoors day PDT likely small quantity PpIX continue activate . Daylight PDT date study exclusively Nordic country prove effective , despite fact country relatively low daylight irradiance . Wiegell et al studied PpIX light dose various latitude July December month . They find Copenhagen , Denmark , country similar latitude Ireland ( 55 degree north former versus 53 degree north later ) possible receive light dose 8 J cm-2 2 hour nearly every day July , August September . In first three week October fell 16 21 day . They also associate weather condition light dose Copenhagen find mean light dose 2 hour July August 10.6 J cm-2 rainy day , 30.7 J cm-2 partly sunny day 38.3 J cm-2 sunny day . It also determine weekly mean temperature need 10 degree higher patient comfortably treat outdoors . Therefore , patient treat daylight PDT Copenhagen 20th April 24th October . A large multicenter study daylight PDT find difference 2 hour 3 hour daylight exposure . In Copenhagen perform daylight PDT April October reschedule treatment day rainy overcast . The investigator propose study use Maquet PWD 50SF theatre light alternative light source daylight . This would provide year-round , well-tolerated treatment option patient . The Maquet PWD 500 theatre light source choose number reason : - 1 . It suitable spectrum , i.e. , emit radiation wave band react efficiently PpIX give optimum response , 2 . It emit UV radiation patient subgroup particularly sensitive . 3 . There infrared ( IR ) radiation emit cause heat therefore complication . 4 . It ideal size geometry treat head . 5 . The output distribution LEDs optimal application . Study protocol : Based prior study similar design , aim significance level 0.05 power 0.80 assumption small clinically important mean difference 15 % standard deviation difference response 25 % , least 22 patient need enrol study . The investigator enrol patient patient refer PDT . For inclusion patient must generally good health attend treatment AKs scalp face . Two symmetrical treatment field define . AKs treatment area count , grade , map photograph . Grading accord Olsen et al ; I , mild ( easily felt see ) , II , moderate ( easily felt see ) , III , severe ( thick obvious AK ) . Sunscreen protection factor 20 applied sun expose area include treatment area ( P20 ; Riemann &amp; Co. A/S , Hilleroed , Denmark ) . This sunscreen choose avoid potential absorption wavelength activate protoporphyrin IX . In patient hyperkeratotic lesion pre-treated paraffin gel remove keratotic debris , carefully avoid bleed . No patient receive pre-treatment analgesia . All patient randomize determine side scalp treat first . Randomization achieve patient choose envelope card mark right left . Approximately 1 gram MAL cream apply right treatment field . They initially treatment daylight PDT , weather permitting . The treatment second side PDT use Maquet PWD 50SF theatre-light light source . After MAL application patient instructed start daylight exposure 30 minute position Maquet PWD 50SF theatre-light . Exposure daylight Maquet PWD light discontinue 2 hour . The second treatment field treat one week later patient daylight PDT one treatment area PDT use Maquet PWD 50SF theatre light light source treatment area . Prior treatment group fluorescence grade scale 1 -3 , use Wood 's light ; one light/pale , 2 moderate 3 strong . For daylight PDT patient record long sit outside weather condition like . Any interruption light exposure must record . For treatment patient rate pain use visual analogue score ( VAS ) ( 1-100 ) 1 , 30 , 60 , 90 120 minute . To use patient move counter along 100 mm scale `` pain '' `` bad pain ever '' . The flip side scale indicate score numerically . A nurse record numerical pain score patient aware value . If treatment discontinue pain time record . Adverse event record . Patient review 1 3 day follow treatment adverse event . Patients assess local reaction erythema erosion ask indicate long pain persist . To assess clinical response patient assess 28 day last treatment . The investigator record patient preference one treatment modality . The investigator use baseline map categorize response AK lesion complete response non-complete response . Patients similarly assess 3 month , 6 month 9 month clinical response . The primary endpoint complete response rate AKs . Secondary endpoint pain score , adverse effect patient preference .</detailed_description>
