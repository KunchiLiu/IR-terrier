	<brief_summary>The overall objective project compare three home-managed treatment regimen PFPS : neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) , transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) , NMES combine TENS standard home exercise program ( HEP ) . Each three treatment arm supplement HEP compare group receive standard HEP alone . The central hypothesis combination NMES TENS show significantly great improvement muscle strength , mobility , pain , daily activity quality life ( QOL ) HEP alone . The investigator examine : 1 ) whether three treatment regimens significantly efficacious standard HEP alone improve low extremity muscle strength , physical activity , mobility , pain , quality life ; 2 ) low extremity muscle strength , physical activity , mobility , pain , quality life differ significantly across 4 time period ; 3 ) interaction treatment time relation lower extremity muscle strength , physical activity , mobility , pain , quality life .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Self-managed Approaches Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome Active Duty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patellofemoral pain syndrome ( PFPS ) common diagnosis among active duty military presenting knee pain military ambulatory care set . The incidence PFPS show striking increase &gt; 11.3 % last 4 year , affect work performance , limit activity , impact military deployment health . The investigator show home-based neuromuscular electrical stimulation ( NMES ) safe , portable , easy-to-use improves quadriceps muscle strength pain relief . NMES transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation ( TENS ) device widely use warfighters theatre operation knee problem . The overall objective project compare three home-managed treatment regimen PFPS : NMES , TENS , NMES combine TENS standard home exercise program ( HEP ) . The central hypothesis combination NMES TENS show significantly great improvement muscle strength , mobility , pain , daily activity quality life ( QOL ) HEP alone . The rationale study increase muscle strength decrease pain significantly improve mobility , physical activity QOL . Such outcome ultimately result improved deployability , retention military personnel decrease economic cost population . The specific aim determine whether three treatment regimens significantly efficacious standard HEP improve muscle strength , physical activity , mobility , QOL symptom PFPS include pain . After consent baseline testing , investigator randomly assign active duty male female subject , age 18 &lt; 45 , ( n=136 ) PFPS one four group . Each three treatment arm supplement HEP compare group receive standard HEP alone . All group receive 9 week home therapy . Using GEE method , investigator build longitudinal regression model difference time trend outcome variable among control treatment group statistically assess . Positive result could translate accelerate rehabilitation , decrease symptom low medical cost well patient outcome .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>The study open active duty personal : 1. diagnose knee pain , categorize anterior retropatellar one knees ; 2. selfreported difficulty perform least two follow activity associate knee pain : prolonged sitting , stair climbing , run , jump repetitive movement kneel squat stooping ; 3. military service member time diagnosis ; 4. age â‰¥18 &lt; 45 year ; 5. ability provide freely give informed consent . Those might risk adverse outcome study intervention exclude . This include individual 1 . Fracture injury external knee structure knee extension flexion impair ; 2 . A significant comorbid medical condition ( severe hypertension , neurological disorder pacemaker/defibrillator ) NMES strength training unsupervised exercise contraindicate would pose safety threat impair ability participate ; 3 . Previous knee surgery ( i.e. , tibiofemoral , patellofemoral ) exclude knee arthroscopy ; 4 . Knee instability recurrent patella dislocation subluxation ; 5 . Inability unwillingness participate home exercise program strengthen program ; 6 . Inability speak and/or read English ; 7 . Reduced sensory perception low extremity ; 8 . Pregnancy ; 9 . Vision impairment , participant classify legally blind ; 10 . Unwillingness accept random assignment ; 11 . A score 23 great Center Epidemiological StudiesDepression scale ( CESD ) .</criteria>
