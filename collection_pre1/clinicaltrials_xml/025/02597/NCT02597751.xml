	<brief_summary>Developmental coordination disorder ( DCD ) affect 5-6 % school-age population , equate ~400,000 child , 1-2 student every Canadian classroom . Children DCD find hard learn motor skill perform everyday activity , get dress , tie shoelace , use utensil , printing , rid bicycle , play sport . Researchers clinician know cause DCD child DCD struggle learn motor skill . Using MRI , study increase understand brain differs child with/without DCD determine rehabilitation change brain improve outcome child disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES AND HYPOTHESES The propose study propose design test overall hypothesis , compare typically-developing child , child DCD ( +/- ADHD ) show difference brain structure function , rehabilitation associate brain difference reflect improvement motor function . The investigator address three specific objective : Objective 1 : To characterize structural functional brain difference child DCD typically-developing child . Hypothesis : Compared typically-developing child , investigator expect child DCD show small cerebellar volume , differences microstructural development motor , sensory cerebellar pathway , decrease strength connectivity resting , default mode , motor network . Children DCD+ADHD show poor function frontal parietal area compare child DCD ( Langevin et al. , 2014 ) . Approach : The investigator use magnetic resonance ( MR ) image advanced MR technique characterize brain structure function ; investigator use morphometry measure cerebral cerebellar volume , diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI ) assess microstructural development , functional connectivity MRI measure connectivity different brain network , fMRI explore pattern brain activation mental rotation task . Objective 2 : To determine current best-practice rehabilitation intervention induce neuroplastic change brain structure/function positive outcome child DCD . Hypotheses : Compared child waitlist control group , investigator expect child two treatment group ( DCD DCD+ADHD ) show : ( 1 ) strengthen functional connectivity resting , default mode , motor network ; ( 2 ) increase integrity frontal-cerebellar pathway ; ( 3 ) increase gray matter volume dorsolateral prefrontal , motor cerebellar cortex ; ( 4 ) improve performance satisfaction rating child-chosen functional motor goal . The investigator also expect positive association functional improvement change brain structure/function . Approach : The investigator measure brain change pre- post-intervention child DCD DCD+ADHD ( treatment versus waitlist control ) . As part treatment , child identify three functional motor goal target intervention . The investigator use Canadian Occupational Performance Measure ( COPM ; Law et al. , 2005 ) measure child 's rating performance satisfaction pre- post-intervention . To supplement COPM , occupational therapist videotape child perform motor goal intervention , independent occupational therapist use Performance Quality Rating Scale ( PQRS ) objectively measure performance change performance ( Miller et al. , 2001 ) . As secondary measure , investigator evaluate fine gross motor skill use Bruininks-Oseretsky Test Motor Proficiency-2 ( BOT-2 : Bruininks &amp; Bruininks , 2005 ) . Objective 3 : To determine neuroplastic functional change retain 3-month follow-up . Hypothesis : The investigator expect child maintain functional gain show increased functional connectivity brain network , increased integrity frontal-cerebellar pathway , increase gray matter volume ( Objective # 2 ) compare child maintain functional gain . If child maintain functional gain , investigator expect improvement brain structure function remain improved post-intervention scan . Approach : MR sequence child rating performance satisfaction functional motor goal repeat treatment waitlist group . The investigator intend recruit 30 typically-developing child , 30 child DCD 30 child DCD+ADHD . Neuroimaging analyse include region interest analysis ( sensory , motor , cerebellar pathway ) well whole brain analysis use tract-based spatial statistic .</detailed_description>
