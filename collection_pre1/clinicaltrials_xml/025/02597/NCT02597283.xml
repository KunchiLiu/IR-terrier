	<brief_title>Coronary Bifurcation Lesions Treated With Biguard Stent System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The current study design multicenter , randomize prospective study aim compare effect Biguard bifurcation stent system regular stent system patient bifurcation lesion . Based previous study , rate 1-year target lesion failure around 12 % PCI regular stent system . And investigator previous data show event 12-month Biguard bifurcation stent system 4 % . Considering lose follow-up , anticipated 400 patient enrolled trial . All patient repeat angiography 13 month , clinical follow-up 2 year .</detailed_description>
