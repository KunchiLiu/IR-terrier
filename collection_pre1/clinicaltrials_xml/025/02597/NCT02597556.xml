The aim study investigate impact anthelmintic treatment incidence viral- bacterial-induced diarrhea school child southern Vietnam . Diarrheal disease remain substantial cause morbidity mortality child Vietnam , child typically co-infected intestinal helminth . As helminths diarrheal pathogen infect intestinal niche , anthelmintic treatment may alter host immune response composition gut microbiota way affect infection disease risk cause diarrheal pathogen . This study recruit 350 helminth-infected 350 helminth-uninfected child age 6-15 year . Recruited child randomize receive either anthelmintic placebo treatment every three month monitor incidence diarrheal disease 12 month . At 12-month time point , child receive anthelmintic treatment . Blood stool sample collect throughout study use evaluation anemia host immune response , classification gut microbes parasite detection , respectively .
