	<brief_title>Physical Activity Patients With Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Who Receive Palliative First-line Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>While safety feasibility well improvement fitness , fatigue certain aspect quality life show physical activity cancer patient treatment , none pre-requisites ( i-iv ) fulfil set patient advanced colon cancer . However , evidence , primarily adjuvant setting , physical activity impact treatment tolerability tumor progression strong enough rationale embark prospective trial . By assess large randomize control trial whether 12-week structured physical activity program chemotherapy patient newly diagnose colorectal cancer undergo standard first-line chemotherapy improve progression-free survival compare standard first-line chemotherapy alone , pre-requisites practice-changing intervention meet . The physical exercise ACTIVE-program describe 12-week exercise program consist combination bi-weekly aerobic exercise ( cycle ergometer ) supervise physical therapist self-paced increase physical activity daily life use pedometer daily step goal motivational tool . In addition supervise exercise program twice week , patient intervention group recommend physically active home . All patient undergo standard systemic therapy metastatic colorectal cancer . Patients care-as-usual group actively encourage change physical activity level e.g . start fitness program chemotherapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Written inform consent accord ICH/GCP regulation randomization . Patient histologically cytologically confirm colorectal carcinoma ( CRC ) require start palliative firstline systemic therapy inoperable metastatic disease . Patients diagnose histologically cytologically confirm nonmetastatic CRC earlier relapse metastatic disease also eligible , prior neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy complete 4 month inclusion trial . Patient measurable disease CT scan MRI perform within 4 week randomization ( measurability criterion accord RECIST 1.1 , nonnodal lesion ≥10 mm , lymph node ≥15mm ) OR evaluable disease i.e . patient nonmeasurable metastasis elevate serum tumormarker ( CEA least &gt; 2xULN ) . Command write spoken language allow informed consent fill trial questionnaire . Baseline patientreported outcome ( PROs ) complete . WHO performance status 02 . Age 1875 ( 80 ) year ( WHO 01 upper age limit 80 year ) . Any potential patient meet follow criterion exclude enter trial Cycle ergometer stress test ( complete within 28 day trial start ) show significant sign ischemic heart disease highgrade arrhythmia , preclude exercise program . Preexisting severe medical condition preclude participation physical activity program determine local investigator . Such condition include : chronic heart failure ( great NYHA II ) , recent myocardial infarction ( le 3 month ago ) , unstable angina pectoris , clinically significant arrhythmia , uncontrolled hypertension repeat systolic blood pressure 160mmHg , COPD ( require oxygen supply GOLD stadium great 2 ) . Inability ride cycle ergometer e.g . musculoskeletal reason . Inability perform 50 Watt cycle ergometer ( Cycle ergometer stress test ) , reason . Patients priori plan curative surgery include metastasectomy . It allow include patient metastasectomy might option chemotherapy induces significant response . Any serious underlying medical condition ( judgment investigator ) could impair ability patient participate trial ( e.g . active autoimmune disease , uncontrolled diabetes ) . Concurrent treatment trial experimental drug anticancer therapy , hypothesize alter tumor progression . Participation observational trial translational trial allow . Previous malignancy within 5 year exception adequately treat cervical carcinoma situ , localize nonmelanoma skin cancer , superficial bladder cancer ( nonmuscle invasive disease ) , localized prostate cancer ( T13 ) . Psychiatric disorder preclude understanding trial information , give informed consent , fill PRO form , interfere compliance . Any psychological , familial , sociological geographical condition potentially hamper proper compliance trial protocol .</criteria>
