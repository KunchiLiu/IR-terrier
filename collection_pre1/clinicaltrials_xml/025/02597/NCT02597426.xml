	<brief_summary>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( NPC ) type head neck cancer . The last three decade research head neck radiation oncology largely focused improvement survival , mostly come cost long term toxicity survive patient . This observational study do learn long-term symptom side effect survivor nasopharyngeal cancer may follow radiation treatment . This study include assessment patient report outcome , physician-graded adverse event , neurocognitive assessment endocrine hearing test</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study design provide comprehensive cross sectional information late toxicity follow radical chemoradiotherapy nasopharyngeal carcinoma patient disease free minimum four year follow-up treat contemporary radiotherapy technique ( IMRT ) . This observational cross-sectional study aim define late effect population , investigate well know toxicity identify study use early radiotherapy technique ( 2D 3D radiotherapy ) well toxicity well define current literature may under-recognized treat ( pituitary function neurocognitive outcome ) . This study ass survivor single time point four year completion treatment disease free . This comprehensive review include demographic data , clinical assessment , biochemical assessment hormonal ( pituitary thyroid ) function , patient report outcome , quality life neurocognitive questionnaire . This study attempt comprehensively review toxicity contemporary patient group modern radiotherapy technique attempt bridge gap current recommend follow protocol actual challenge face long term survivor . Some factor correlate radiation dos receive patient inform radiation dose threshold appropriate toxicity ( hypothalamic-pituitary , thyroid , temporal lobe necrosis , neurocognitive performance ) . Patients offer follow-up , required appropriate personnel appropriate , include neuropsychology , endocrinology otoloryngology .</detailed_description>
