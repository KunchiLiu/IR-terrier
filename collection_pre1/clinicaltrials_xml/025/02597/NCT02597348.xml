	<brief_summary>This multicentric randomized parallel group open trial compare 5-year survival chemotherapy follow LT ( Group LT+C ) versus chemotherapy alone ( Group C ) patient confirm unresectable liver-only metastasis , well control chemotherapy ( progression ) extensively explored modern image technique . The primary objective trial validate large multicentric cohort select patient possibility obtain least 50 % 5-years survival LT combine chemotherapy compare around 10 % chemotherapy alone .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Liver transplantation ( LT ) recently propose alternative treatment definitively unresectable colorectal liver metastasis select patient 60 % estimate survival 5 year recent prospective Norwegian study . However , disease free survival ( DFS ) preliminary study poor 90 % recurrence LT . The objective study validate LT therapeutic option large multicentric scale throughout highly strict policy selection term survival , disease free survival quality life . In order reduce selection bias , unresectability criterion theorical indication LT confirm independent Steering Committee include HPB surgeon , oncologist , radiologist hepatologists .</detailed_description>
