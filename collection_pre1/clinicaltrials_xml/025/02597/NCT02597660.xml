	<brief_summary>Patellar tendinopathy one frequent cause non-traumatic knee pain reduced function patient . Standard treatment option patellar tendinopathies include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug , corticosteroid , cryotherapy , manual therapy , eccentric exercise , ultrasound . Unfortunately many patient fail respond therapy return normal activity level , recurrence rate respond unacceptably high . Many patient fail respond display persistent degenerative change image study suggest failure regenerate pathological tissue . Developing new therapy directly promote synthesis new , healthy extracellular matrix tissue could therefore address important therapeutic need make substantial improvement ability effectively treat patellar tendinopathy reduce recurrence rate . Somatropin ( human growth hormone recombinant DNA origin ) show increase protein synthesis matrix production deliver directly tendon . This study evaluate ability somatropin improve clinical outcome tissue quality patient chronic tendinopathy .</brief_summary>
