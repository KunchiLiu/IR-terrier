	<detailed_description>The purpose protocol create electronic registry house phenotypic information patient type bone condition . The initial focus registry include U.S. patient achondroplasia . Once populated co-investigators particular interest , expertise large clinical population bone condition , collective data query pursue clinical research question pertain health outcome treatment option patient complex condition . The registry longitudinal nature functionality retrospectively enter patient ' clinical data prenatal period recent encounter , intervene data enter chronologic fashion . The database create RedCap , publicly available database format create researcher University Miami specifically academic researcher collaborate across multiple research site . The rationale create database simple ; achondroplasia relatively rare collaboration among researcher essential gather similarly affected patient answer common clinical research question . The goal well understand natural history treatment outcomes patient . This registry build , base maintain personnel Greenberg Center Skeletal Dysplasias McKusick-Nathans Institute Genetic Medicine ( IGM ) Johns Hopkins . The registry web-based therefore easily accessible co-investigators site across U.S. , include Alfred I. DuPont Wilmington , Delaware , University Wisconsin Madison University Texas . Our goal enroll least 1500 patient achondroplasia aforementioned site . Access registry password-protected data back IGM server daily . A co-investigator able enter access identify information ( i.e . name , address , contact information , DOB ) patient registry . Thereafter , unique study identification number , calculate age subject ( base date data entry ) diagnosis identifier accessible co-investigators . The total deidentified phenotype data available co-investigators data analysis .</detailed_description>
