	<brief_summary>Patients cognitive impairment follow stroke often deny access inpatient rehabilitation , despite evidence benefit . Patients cognitive impairment admit inpatient stroke rehabilitation often receive service base outdated impairment-reduction model , rather recommend function-based approach . These two issue , reduce access rehabilitation knowledge-to-practice gap , stem report lack skill knowledge part stroke rehabilitation team foster recovery people cognitive impairment . To address issue , investigator implement evaluate multi-faceted , support , integrate knowledge translation initiative , target specifically inter-professional application Cognitive Orientation daily Occupational Performance ( CO-OP ) , call CO-OP KT . CO-OP contemporary , effective , cognitive strategy-based treatment approach . CO-OP KT combination CO-OP Approach multi-faceted knowledge translation support . Clinical staff participate institution receive CO-OP KT training . The long-term objective CO-OP KT optimize functional outcome individual stroke cognitive impairment . Three specific research question pose , one focus registration . That sub study relate patient outcome follow CO-OP KT train initiative address use non-randomized design historical control . Patient participant enroll project prior implement CO-OP KT training belong historical control group . Patient participant enroll project CO-OP KT training belong CO-OP KT Exposure group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The investigative team implement evaluate multi-faceted , support , integrate knowledge translation initiative call CO-OP KT . The long-term objective CO-OP KT optimize functional outcome individual stroke cognitive impairment . Three specific research question pose , one focus registration : 1 . Is CO-OP KT associate change activity , participation , self-efficacy perform daily activity patient cognitive impairment follow stroke discharge inpatient rehabilitation 1 , 3 , 6-month follow-up ? The research question , relate patient outcome , address use non-randomized design historical control . Recruitment : Five inpatient stroke rehabilitation unit combine stroke/neurology unit within Toronto Stroke Networks agree participate . It estimate 5 unit together approximately 80 admission per month . Patients admit inpatient stroke unit least cognitive impairment recruit . Cognitive impairment determine use Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoCA ) . Patients score low 26 include . Based data previously publish study , sample size 13 per group 80 % power detect between-group difference 9 point FIMâ„¢ , standard deviation 8 . Allowing 30 % attrition source , investigator recruit 17 participant per group , 34 total . Based past experience , investigator expect consent rate 1 participant per site per month . Thus , recruitment highly feasible , likely complete 4 month group . Data Analysis : Descriptive statistic compile quantitative data collect . Between- within-group difference outcome measure examine use repeat measure ANOVA non-randomized trial individual patient historical control .</detailed_description>
