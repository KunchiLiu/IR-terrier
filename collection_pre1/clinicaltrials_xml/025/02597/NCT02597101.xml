	<brief_title>Anti-Inflammatory Small Drug Adjunctive Therapy Type 2 Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) characterize concomitant insulin resistance pancreatic beta cell dysfunction . Disease prevalence continue increase around globe currently estimate 385 million affected people . As many 1 3 people United States could diabetes year 2050 significant economic consequence . In 2014 , 1 5 health care dollar spend support care patient total estimate cost &gt; $ 245 billion . Overweight , insulin-resistant ( IR ) T2D individual manifest chronic systemic inflammation impairs beta cell peripheral insulin sensitivity . This systemic inflammation associate atherogenic lipid profile predispose individual high risk micro- macro-vascular disease , irrespective well-controlled glycemia . Although variety pharmacologic approach maintain daily glycemic control , become evident urgent need identify adjunctive therapy improve , insulin sensitivity , beta cell function , HbA1c since begin deteriorate quite substantially 5 year follow initial treatment . Ideally , adjunctive therapy well-tolerated , easy administer , promote hypoglycemia also attenuate systemic inflammation . The role neutrophils T2D metabolic inflammation represent important gap knowledge well understand inflammation T2D especially since neutrophil abundant leukocyte population human constitute bulk inflammatory leukocyte . Emerging evidence indicate neutrophil along neutrophil-derived elastase serve important nexus T2D-associated inflammation . This trial offer first-in-kind opportunity well understand role neutrophil T2D diabetic . We hypothesise inhibition neutrophil elastase ( NE ) attenuate chronic systemic background inflammation overweight obese , IR T2D subject potential improvement insulin sensitivity glucose control could concurrently facilitate functional maintenance induce rescue pancreatic beta cell mass . To test hypothesis , propose clinical trial comprise follow two aim : Aim 1 : To test whether orally-administered NEI adjunctive therapy obese , IR T2D subject improve insulin sensitivity , glucoregulation glycemic control . The primary endpoint improvement insulin sensitivity 6 month compare baseline , assess hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp method . Secondary endpoint include : ) Safety ( rate severity adverse event include hypoglycemia ) ; ii ) Glycemic metabolic control variable ; iii ) Assessment functional beta cell mass ( improvement baseline oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ) C-peptide level AUC , insulin secretion rate ( ISR ) , body mass body fat-corrected insulin sensitivity ; iv ) Changes inflammatory variable . Exploratory endpoint include improvement OGTT C-peptide ( C-peptide AUC ) trajectory , ISR trajectory , decrease dose dose frequency background drug . Aim 2 : To inform change innate cellular immunity confer trial study agent mechanistic approach understanding basis potential efficacy . Evidence suppression systemic inflammation examine trial . Changes gene expression PBL neutrophil may provide signature responder versus non-responder status and/or effect therapy .</detailed_description>
