	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study target biopsy determine response patient prostate cancer undergo high-dose-rate brachytherapy ( type radiation therapy radioactive material seal needle , seed , wire , catheter place directly near tumor ) . Studying tumor tissue obtain treatment may help doctor understand change pathway look deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) repair damage see difference prostate tissue prior start androgen deprivation therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Targeted Biopsies Determining Response Patients With Prostate Cancer Undergoing High-Dose-Rate Brachytherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Demonstrate feasibility obtain adequate tumor tissue intra-prostatic index lesion prior start androgen deprivation therapy ( ADT ) time high-dose-rate ( HDR ) brachytherapy . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Use immunohistochemistry stain cell pre-ADT post 2 month ADT marker non-homologous end join DNA double strand break use follow marker : Ku70 , Ku80 , DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit ( PKCs ) , gamma-histone family , member X ( H2AX ) . OUTLINE : Patients undergo biopsy baseline start ADT brachytherapy .</detailed_description>
