	<brief_summary>Human milk ( HM ) food complex ; addition micronutrient human-coded bioactive complex also include many antioxidant , antibacterial , prebiotics , probiotic , immune-boosting constituent , many bioactive component . Some component may deteriorate storage , express EHM start deteriorate soon leaf breast . Nevertheless , whenever nursing breast feed fresh EHM possible , feed store EHM consider next best thing feed breast . Efficient heat transfer ability affect heat cooling process . In study investigator wish test new device permit rapid heat cooling process . The investigator plan measure thermolabile constituent HM order determine whether might protect gentle warm process . The investigator plan collect milk mother , mix test effect storage heating . This experiment design test feasibility efficiency device .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Exclusive breastfeed normative model alternative feeding method must measure regard infant growth , health , development , short long-term outcome . Recommendations `` safe '' storage Expressed HM develop , mainly use HM bank , constitutes optimal storage less evident . Optimal handle Expressed HM ( EHM ) include proper storage well proper heat thaw prior use , order reduce damage nutritional bioactive component . Efficient heat transfer ability affect heat cooling process . In previous work , investigator show overheat EHM highly probable use commercially available electrical water-based bottle warmer , even manufacturer 's recommendation follow . Besides warm process , EHM stability also affect container composition shape , storage temperature whether sterilization effect prior storage . Following previous study , investigator hypothesize non-standard storage warm process may increase EHM preservation . The investigator therefore design novel device large surface area narrow milk width order minimize temperature gradient within milk volume . The investigator plan store heat HM regular baby bottle device test thermolabile property HM , certain protein microbiological culture , asses new device indeed protect milk . In order obtain EHM mother , investigator collect freshly pump milk The pumped milk pool single container . A milk sample take define reference value equally divide three study container six control container ( C-container , regular baby bottle ) . After fill , container place dark refrigerator temperature 4ºC . The experiment last 5 day . On first day , one S-container two C-containers take refrigerator test : milk container warm feeding temperature container ; stir gently sample warm milk obtain store -20ºC analyze . This procedure repeat day 3 5 experiment . The warming procedure use C-containers follow : C-container warm standard electric water-based bottle warmer . Usually warmer three heating option ; fast , medium , slow . Investigators plan test fast option three six bottle slow option remain three bottle . The heating process terminate temperature heat milk reach 37ºC . The warming procedure use S-containers follow : S-container place bowl contain water approximately 40ºC gently move circle EHM reach 37 ºC .</detailed_description>
