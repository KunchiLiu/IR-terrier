	<detailed_description>Undernutrition widespread Bangladesh . In 2011 , accord Bangladesh Demographic Health Survey , 41.3 per cent child age five stunt , 36.4 per cent underweight , 15.6 per cent waste , 50 per cent anaemic . Prevalences even high among extremely poor household . Meanwhile , evidence South Asia show high rate economic growth reduction poverty lead similarly large reduction undernutrition ( see 1 , 2 , 3 ) . These finding suggest improvement income alone may sufficient improve nutritional status . Extensive research also show critical window nutritional intervention `` first thousand day '' life ( see 4 , 5 ) , time child utero two year age . Based accumulated evidence , grow attention come introducing nutrition intervention target child 's `` first thousand day '' alongside household poverty reduction programme . In particular , grow emphasis nutrition intervention aim improve infant young child feed practices—through increase nutritional knowledge woman pregnant , lactating , likely pregnant future—as well improve nutritional status woman . Although exists considerable evidence assess effectiveness various livelihood intervention social protection programme , well evidence effectiveness various direct nutritional intervention , little research directly assess integrate livelihood nutrition programme might compare livelihood support alone . There several reason combination nutrition livelihood support may nutritional benefit livelihood support . First , key constraint improve nutritional status may insufficient knowledge appropriate infant young child feeding practice ( example , appropriate duration exclusive breastfeeding , appropriate frequency diversity child feed thereafter , etc. ) . If case , improve income alone necessarily lead improve feeding practice . Second , may synergies two type support . For example , even mother 's knowledge infant young child feed practice improves , may still need access sufficient resource undertake practice ( income purchase recommend type food ) , facilitate livelihood intervention . Third , may dynamics shift direct nutrition intervention mediate livelihood intervention affect nutritional status . For example , direct nutrition intervention target woman improve woman 's bargain power within household , woman tend prefer devote resource young child 's nutrition ( e.g. , Quisumbing Maluccio 2003 ) , result may also large impact nutritional status livelihood support alone . The DFID Programme Accelerate Improved Nutrition Extreme Poor Bangladesh aim improve nutrition outcomes young child , pregnant lactating mother , adolescent girl . Its approach integrate direct nutrition intervention livelihood support currently provide extremely poor household Bangladesh three exist programme : Chars Livelihoods Programme ( CLP ) , Shiree Economic Empowerment Poorest Programme ( Shiree EEP , within investigator focus Concern subproject ) , Urban Partnership Poverty Reduction Programme ( UPPR ) . In order rigorously independently assess impact integrate nutrition livelihood programme , DFID collaborate research partner implementation partner undertake mixed method impact evaluation , entitle `` Impact Evaluation DFID Programme Accelerate Improved Nutrition Extreme Poor Bangladesh . '' The evaluation team include IDS ( lead organisation ) , IFPRI , ITAD , CNRS , BRAC University . The evaluation use mixed quantitative qualitative method within strong theory-based design ass impact integrate programme nutritional status . The quantitative impact component involve baseline survey ( conduct September-November 2013 ) endline survey ( conduct November-December 2015 ) . The exploratory/explanatory component include qualitative subcomponent ( first phase fieldwork ongoing since February 2014 ) , well process evaluation subcomponent ( ongoing since July 2014 , final result yet available ) . The cost effectiveness component begin August 2014 complete early 2016 follow quantitative endline survey completion . The three key research question regard programme impact address : 1 . What impact nutrition outcome receive combination livelihood direct nutrition intervention ( denote scenario ( L+N ) ) , relative receiving livelihood intervention ( denote scenario ( L ) ) ? 2 . What impact nutrition outcome receive combination livelihood direct nutrition intervention ( L+N ) , relative receiving intervention ( denote scenario ( C ) control ) ? 3 . What impact nutrition outcome receive livelihood intervention ( L ) , relative receiving intervention ( C ) ? This pertain urban group serve UPPR . In order construct proxy ( L+N ) households counterfactual ( L ) scenario , randomisation use . Among household already receive livelihood intervention baseline , half randomly assign additionally receive nutrition intervention baseline ( denote ( L+N ) group ) . The remain half continue receive livelihood intervention ( denote ( L ) group ) . Randomisation conduct level primary sample unit ( PSUs ) cover entire locality , rather level individual household . The randomisation make likely characteristic ( L ) ( L+N ) group average similar baseline . ( L ) valid proxy ( L+N ) , average difference group endline interpret impact cause addition nutrition component rather pre-existing difference . In order construct proxy ( L+N ) households counterfactual ( C ) scenario intervention , non-randomised approach use . Since none original livelihood intervention roll follow randomise control trial design , obvious set comparable non-beneficiaries serve counterfactual . Because control group nonetheless require assess absolute benefit either ( L ) ( L + N ) intervention , attempt make construct best possible control group non-randomly select non-beneficiaries . It important emphasise non-random control group expect average identical beneficiary household . In baseline survey , objective simply sample group non-beneficiaries similar possible beneficiary except receipt intervention . Major topic area cover qualitative data collection tool include follow : 1 . Social , economic , institutional political context community 2 . Local practice , resource , custom regard health , hygiene , nutrition care child , pregnant lactation mother , adolescent girl 3 . For ( L ) ( L+N ) sit : Perceived impact livelihood intervention 4 . For ( L+N ) sit : Perceived synergy disconnect nutrition livelihood intervention communities 5 . For ( L+N ) sit : Micro-dynamics nutrition intervention community level beneficiary perceive/experience intervention</detailed_description>
