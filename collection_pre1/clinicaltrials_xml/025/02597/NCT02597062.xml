	<brief_title>High-Dose Weekly Carfilzomib Plus Cyclophosphamide Dexamethasone Treatment Relapsed Multiple Myeloma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple Myeloma cancer affect bone marrow cell blood system form . This include white cell , red cell , platelet lymphoid cell . In multiple myeloma plasma cell ( one lymphoid cell ) start reproduce control . This result crowd bone marrow abnormal production cell malfunction plasma cell . They also cause damage normal bone result pain , fracture complication . The standard usual treatment disease lenalidomide ( immunomodulatory drug ) bortezomib ( proteasome inhibitor ) base treatment . Carfilzomib new type proteasome inhibitor approve treatment relapse multiple myeloma United States .</detailed_description>
