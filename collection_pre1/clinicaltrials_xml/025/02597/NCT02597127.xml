	<brief_summary>This study Phase II , placebo-controlled , double-blind , randomized trial 480 subject atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ( ASCVD ) ASCVD-risk equivalent ( eg , diabetes familial hypercholesterolemia ) elevate LDL-C despite maximum tolerate dose LDL-C lowering therapy evaluate efficacy , safety , tolerability ALN PCSSC injection ( ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial Evaluate Effect ALN-PCSSC Treatment Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol ( LDL-C )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects screen 480 eligible subject randomize : 60 subject per six ALN-PCSSC dose group plus 120 subject total across placebo group ( 20 subject match six drug dose group ) . Treatment allocation stratify country current use statins lipid-modifying therapy . Each subject either receive either one two injection Day 1 single injection Day 1 Day 90 blind ALN PCSSC placebo . Formation ADA assess Day 1 prior 4 hour injection ) Days 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 150 , 180 ( Days 150 180 subject receive second dose study drug ) 210 ADA response become negative within study duration . The independent Data Monitoring Committee ( DMC ) review safety data begin first 40 subject receive first injection ALN-PCSSC placebo complete Day 14 follow-up visit . Thereafter DMC review safety data every 2 month end trial . A recommendation may take stop amend study review . On Day 1 , eligible subject randomize receive first SC administration ALN PCSSC placebo . After first study drug administration , subject observe clinic least 4 hour post injection discharge . Subjects return Day 14 monthly interval 6 month . Subjects randomize receive second dose study drug receive second injection ALN-PCSSC placebo Day 90 visit . Efficacy assessment include measure effect ALN-PCSSC level LDL-C lipid lipoproteins include total cholesterol ( TC ) , triglyceride , high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( HDL-C ) , non-HDL-C , low-density lipoprotein ( VLDL ) , apolipoprotein A1 ( Apo-AI ) , apolipoprotein B ( Apo-B ) , lipoprotein ( ) [ Lp ( ) ] , C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , PCSK9 . End study ( EOS ) evaluation conduct EOS visit ( Day 210 ) . The expected duration subject ' involvement study approximately 374 day include screening , study drug administration , course single multiple injection , follow-up period Day 360 . Subjects complete study Day 210 give opportunity enroll separate long-term extension study . Any subject LDL-C level return &gt; 80 % baseline value , continue follow part study either level reach maximum day 360 point give opportunity enroll long-term extension study . At visit , LDL-C level , adverse event ( AE ) , serious adverse event ( SAE ) , concomitant medication safety laboratory assessment collect . Objectives : Primary : To evaluate effect ALN-PCSSC treatment LDL-C level Day 180 . Secondary : - LDL-C day 90 - LDL-C level time point - PCSK9 level time - Other lipid , lipoprotein , apolipoproteins - Proportion subject achieve pre-specified global lipid guideline - Individual responsiveness different dose - Duration lipid-lowering effect different dose - Safety tolerability profile ALN-PCSSC To evaluate effect ALN-PCSSC following : • Exploratory : To collect/evaluate effect ALN-PCSSC following : - Cardiovascular ( CV ) event CV death , non-fatal MI , resuscitate cardiac arrest non-fatal stroke ( ischemic hemorrhagic ) - Evaluation anti-drug antibody ( ADA ) investigational product</detailed_description>
