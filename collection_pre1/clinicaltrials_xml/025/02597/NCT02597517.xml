	<brief_summary>Endoscopy tool greatly influence gastroenterological diagnosis . However , conventional endoscopy limit detect lesion basis gross morphological change therefore certainly diagnosis depend biopsy sample macroscopically obvious endoscopic feature , blind biopsy sample normal appear mucosa risk miss pathology sample error . Gastric cancer second common cause cancer relate death . One main role upper gastrointestinal endoscopy identify gastric cancer early stage . The importance identify H. pylori infection play important role gastric carcinogenesis , progress chronic gastritis atrophic gastritis , intestinal metaplasia , dysplasia finally cancer . The importance recognition precancerous gastric lesion detect tumor early stage improve survival . Most study conclude difficult diagnose H. pylorus relate gastritis gastric atrophy basis endoscopic finding . Histology therefore currently consider gold standard detect H. pylori infection . The reliability detect H. pylori infection histologically depend site , number , size gastric biopsy specimen , well expertise stain visualize bacteria . Considerable error also occur identify gastric atrophy use blind biopsy sampling , neither original revise version Sydney system reliably identify half case patient confirm gastric atrophy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>New Technology Differentiate Normal Gastric Mucosa From Helicobacter Pylori Associated Gastritis Gastric Atrophy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Recently image-enhanced endoscopic technology use pre-processor band-limited light call Optical Enhancement system ( OE system™ ) , develop HOYA Co. ( Tokyo , Japan ) equip late endoscopy system ( Pentax Video Processor EPK-i7010 ; HOYA Co. ) . This new technology combine digital signal processing similar way I-scan optical filter limit spectral characteristic illumination light . Previous I-scan technology use white light alone illumination light digital post-processing reflection afterwards create image yield virtual chromoendoscopic image . Emission white light alone cause potential limitation current I-scan technology obtain high contrast image microvascular pattern mucosal surface combination high magnification show NBI optical magnification . The basic concept OE overcome darkness NBI witch result less usefulness detectability wide-range observation gastrointestinal lumen . The new innovated optical filter achieve high overall transmittance connect peak hemoglobin absorption spectrum ( 415 nm , 540 nm 570 nm ) create continuous wavelength spectrum . There two mode different OE filter ( Mode 1 Mode 2 ) . Mode 1 design mainly improve visualization microvessels sufficient amount light , Mode 2 design improve contrast white-light observation bring color tone overall image closer natural color ( white color tone ) much light Mode 1 filter . In addition , new scope develop combine high definition image optical magnification call Magniview™ . These scope increase image 136 time well quality image standard scope without optical zoom . This allow optimal much clear evaluation mucosa superficial vascular aspect , possibly identify early suggestive sign inflammation lesion see use conventional videoendoscopy , high definition scope white light digital post-processor filter system I-Scan™ . Estimated enrollment : A total 100 patient functional dyspepsia include ( intervention group : 50 patient control group : 50 patient ) Study design : This observational analytical cross-section , population - base survey study , prospective case collection , non randomize double blind , perform Tertiary Academic Center . - Allocation : Non randomize , double blind - Endpoint Classification : Efficacy - Intervention Model : Non interventional - Primary Purpose : Diagnosis Setting : Ecuadorian Institute Digestive Diseases ( IECED ) , OmniHospital Academic Tertiary Center . We include patient October 2015 December 2015 . Patients recruit gastroenterology unit ( IECED ) . The study protocol consent form approve Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) conduct accord declaration Helsinki . Patients sign inform consent . Population selection , inclusion exclusion criterion : All participant functional dyspepsia test Helicobacter Pylori ( HP ) use stool antigen test . After phase group patient , dyspeptic HP ( + ) dyspeptic HP ( - ) . The first group intervention group dyspeptic HP ( - ) patient serve control group . None patient endoscopist know group patient belongs . Functional dyspepsia consider accord Rome III . Criteria . It include Epigastric pain Syndrome define locate pain burn upper abdomen , least week , intermittent , generalize , relieve defecation without criterion gall bladder sphincter Oddi pathology ; Postprandial distress Syndrome define presence one condition include nag feel postprandial fullness normal volume meal , several time week early satiety prevents completion regular meal , several time week . The criterion must present last three month start least 6 month diagnosis . Endoscopic technique : All patient include protocol ( intervention group control group ) study upper endoscopy Magniview™ scopes EPK-i7010 processor ( OE system™ ) . The endoscopy image see 27inch , flat panel , high definition LCD monitor ( Radiance™ ultra SC-WU27-G1520 model ) . The endoscopy perform three endoscopist train new technology ( 10 procedure ) . Initially complete ( esophagus , stomach , duodenum ) conventional white light upper endoscopy perform detailed observation whole stomach . After gastric body evaluate OE System Magniview . The technique involve use distal black rubber hood ( OE-A58 ) tip scope ( EG-2990Zi ) fix distance tip endoscope gastric mucosa 2mm . First OE system™ use ( mode 1 2 ) , optical magnification implement action button Magniview scope . After reach maximum magnification level , cup contact gastric mucosa water instill . Any residue stomach remove use water ejection pump . The evaluation gastric mucosa perform gastric body instead antrum antrum collect venule lie deep layer see . The endoscopic finding gastric body classify Anagnostopoulos GK et al . classification four type : type 1 , honeycomb−type subepithelial capillary network ( SECN ) regular arrangement collect venule regular , round pit ; type 2 , honeycomb−type SECN regular , round pit , loss collecting venule ; type 3 , loss normal SECN collecting venule , enlarge white pit surround erythema ; type 4 , loss normal SECN round pit , irregular arrangement collect venule . Type 1 pattern predict normal gastric , type 2 3 pattern predict Helicobacter pylorus infection type 4 pattern predict gastric atrophy . The gastric body photographically record , include image normal mucosa gastric mucosal change . Finally biopsies take group , use regular biopsy forceps ; randomly biopsy follow Sydney protocol ( two gastric body , two antrum one incisura angularis ) target biopsy area type 2,3 4 pattern , correlate histological change H. pylorus gastritis gastric atrophy . The diagnosis positive H. pylorus infection do participant direct visualization histological examination use stool antigen test H pylorus . Interobserver Intraobserver Agreement : A data set contain photographs gastric lesion present three blinded endoscopists confirm finding . Inter intra-observer reproducibility measure base comparison still image three investigator . To evaluate intra-observer agreement investigator ass image two time answer compare . To evaluate inter-observer agreement answer three investigator compare . Statistical analysis : Base line characteristic compare case control group use Chi-square Fisher Test categorical variable , continue variable , Mann-Whitney Test use . The sensitivity , specificity , predictive value endoscopic finding normal gastric mucosa , H. pylorus infection , gastric atrophy calculate . To examine inter intra observer agreement , kappa value calculate . A P value le 0.05 consider statistically significant . All statistical analysis perform use SPSS software suite v.22 . Limitations : The protocol perform one center group selection random</detailed_description>
