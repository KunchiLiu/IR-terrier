	<brief_summary>This study serve determine influenza infection alters bacterial colonization pattern nasal oropharyngeal compartment , whether immune response correlate alteration . The investigator determine bacterial composition immune response nose oropharynx influenza infection . Specific Aims Therefore , overall aim study follow : 1 . To identify baseline composition kinetic change nasal oropharyngeal microflora immune response administer intranasal live attenuate influenza virus ( i.e. , FluMist® vaccine ) saline mist healthy subject ; 2 . To identify nasal oropharyngeal microbial composition local immune response influenza infection resolution infection , correlate change clinical outcome .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Randomization Post-Randomization Visits After undergo nasal swabs nasopharyngeal wash , nasal epithelial brushing , healthy volunteer randomly assign receive either saline nasal spray ( placebo ) FluMist® nasal influenza vaccine ( live attenuate influenza vaccine , LAIV ) . They return 1-2 week 4-6 week later repeat nasal swabs nasopharyngeal wash , nasal epithelial brushing do Enrollment Visit . Samples process isolate 16 bacterial RNA host RNA . 16 rRNA analyze 16S sequence determine composition bacterial microbiome pre post LAIV saline ( placebo ) administration . Host immune response assess base upon microarray analysis host RNA pre post LAIV saline administration .</detailed_description>
