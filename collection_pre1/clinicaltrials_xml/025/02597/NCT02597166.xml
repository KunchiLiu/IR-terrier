	<brief_summary>There several license drug treatment patient HCV infection . These medication show effective get rid virus patient HCV infection include early stage cirrhosis without complication know compensated cirrhosis , great 90 % cure rate . At present , little data show treat patient HCV infection decompensated cirrhosis give effect . However , patient decompensated cirrhosis result hepatitis B infection receive treatment control virus show improvement overall liver condition , liver complication many patient disappear . Also , patient cirrhosis due excess alcohol stop drinking also show improvement liver function complication cirrhosis come control . Therefore , treatment patient HCV infection decompensated cirrhosis expect show positive effect , underlie cause cirrhosis come control . Harvoni combination two direct-acting antiviral ( ledipasvir sofosbuvir ) prevent hepatitis C virus copy multiplying , allow body clear virus system cure HCV infection . This study conduct find treatment Harvoni lead clearance HCV infection patient decompensated cirrhosis give rise improvement liver function , together improvement quality life survival .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effects Harvoni Patients With Decompensated Cirrhosis Due Hepatitis C Genotype 1 Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) one common cause liver cirrhosis worldwide . The progression liver cirrhosis lead myriad complication include ascites , variceal bleeding , hepatic encephalopathy , hepatorenal syndrome , hepatocellular carcinoma . The development complication decompensation lead dismal survival 50 % 6 month , especially underlying cause liver cirrhosis treat . The cost caring patient decompensated cirrhosis extremely high . Despite , every effort make maintain patient reasonable health liver transplant become available . Yet patient continue poor quality life various symptom relate decompensated cirrhosis , spend much time visit health care facility outpatient inpatient care . The recent availability potent effective anti-viral therapy revolutionize management patient hepatitis C infection . With &gt; 90 % cure rate , many patient compensated cirrhosis , treat , progress develop decompensation . With passage time , liver cirrhosis may even regress non-cirrhotic state . Published data treatment decompensated cirrhosis hepatitis C infection still scanty . However , patient decompensated cirrhosis due hepatitis B infection receive effective anti-viral therapy improve overall clinical status , many patient revert decompensated compensated state , associate improved survival . Likewise , patient alcoholic cirrhosis abstain alcohol also improvement liver function reduction complication cirrhosis . Therefore , treatment decompensated cirrhotic patient hepatitis C expect show beneficial effect , underlie cause cirrhosis come control . The primary objective study assess effect anti-viral therapy clinical status , quality life survival patient decompensated cirrhosis due chronic hepatitis C genotype 1 infection . After completion initial investigation , patient start Harvoni 90 mg ledipasvir/400 mg sofosbuvir ( one tablet ) daily . The course treatment 24 week . Patients review monthly interval per standard care . At clinic visit , patient blood test include complete blood count , renal function , electrolytes , liver enzyme liver function test , HCV RNA do week 4 , week 12 , week 24 treatment , week 12 post completion treatment . Annual ultrasounds surveillance gastroscopy organize per standard care . Patient follow 1 year post completion treatment , repeat quality life questionnaire end treatment , thereafter 6 12 month . Patients also monitor development complication cirrhosis ( ) , hospital admission , reason hospital admission , lengths hospital stay , survival , liver transplantation .</detailed_description>
