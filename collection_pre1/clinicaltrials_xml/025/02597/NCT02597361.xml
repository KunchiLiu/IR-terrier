	<brief_summary>This study aim verify hypothesis patient Vascular Ehlers Danlos syndrome ( vEDS ) benefit blockade angiotensin ( Ang ) II noxious effect vasculature affect defect type III collagen addition effect celiprolol . This randomized , double blind , placebo control trial compare administration Ang II type I receptor blocker ( ARB ) — irbesartan— placebo 2-year period vEDS patient main objective reduce incidence symptomatic asymptomatic vascular event .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Angiotensin II Receptor Blockade Vascular Ehlers Danlos Syndrome ( ARCADE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>vEDS rare life-threatening inherited condition due mutation COL3A1 gene encode pro-alpha 1 chain type III procollagen ( OMIM # 130050 ) unpredictable recur arterial dissections/aneurysms start early adulthood . The investigator previously show treatment 200-400 mg per day celiprolol , reduce fatal non-fatal vascular event patient vEDS . If tolerate , treatment standard treatment vEDS . However , despite celiprolol , symptomatic asymptomatic arterial event continue occur vEDS patient . Recent finding suggest possible deleterious effect endogenous Angiotensin II medium size artery vEDS patient . The hypothesis study blockade endogenous Ang II provide supplemental vascular protection thus reduce recurrence arterial event vEDS patient . The primary objective study determine patient molecularly proven vEDS , whether Ang II receptor blocker , prescribe optimally tolerate dose combine reference celiprolol treatment , decrease 24 month rate asymptomatic symptomatic cardiovascular ( CV ) event compare placebo . Methodology : Multicenter , double-blind , randomize ( 1:1 ) , placebo-controlled , parallel group , study blind endpoint evaluation adult vEDS patient . Main criteria inclusion : Patients sex age 18 70 year molecularly proven vEDS , acute phase disease , contra-indication take Ang II blocker .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients geneticallyproven vEDS ( presence pathogenic mutation COL3A1 gene ) ; Age ≥18 year &lt; 70 year ; Men woman reliable contraception negative betaHCG screening ; Celiprolol optimal tolerate dose since least 12 week ; vEDS patient fully intolerant celiprolol treat drug active vascular system , except another betablocker ; No compelling indication ARB therapy ( renal infarction , hypertension , proteinuric nephropathy , chronic heart failure , myocardial infarction , stroke ) ; Estimated glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) ≥ 30ml/min/1,73m2 ( MDRD Formula ) ; Normal clinically acceptable 12lead ECG ; Written inform consent participate study . General criterion Unlikely cooperate study and/or poor compliance anticipate investigator , e.g. , uncooperative attitude , inability return followup visit , unlikelihood completing study ; Participation another interventional therapeutic study time within 3 month prior begin present study ; Participant affiliate French social security ; No write informed consent ; Severe contrast medium allergy , amenable pretreatment Medical therapeutic criterion History previous symptomatic visceral complication ( CV event , pulmonary digestive event ) 3 month precede inclusion ; Formal indication antihypertensive medication ( office BP ≥140/90 mmHg celiprolol least two separated visit , confirm daytime ambulatory BP home BP ≥ 135/85 mmHg ) ; Concomitant treatment reninangiotensinaldosterone system block agent apart study drug , e.g . ACEI , ARB aldosteroneantagonist renin inhibitor , give elective indication ( heart failure , renal infarction , chronic kidney disease , proteinuria , myocardial infarction , stroke ) ; Any cardiac condition justifies specific medical care ( i.e . second third degree auriculoventricular block , potentially life threaten arrhythmia uncontrolled arrhythmia persistent arrhythmia , clinically significant valvular heart disease ) ; Known significant renal artery stenosis evidence renal ischemia ( Duplex ultrasound , CTA , exam ) ; Any concurrent life threaten condition vEDS life expectancy le 2 year ; Likely allergy hypersensitivity irbesartan , base know allergy drug class , opinion investigator suggest increase potential adverse hypersensitivity well know suspect contraindication study drug ; Any condition opinion investigator would jeopardize evaluation efficacy safety ; Pregnant nursing ( lactate ) woman , pregnancy define state female conception termination gestation , confirm positive Human Chorionic Gonadotropin ( hCG ) laboratory test ( &gt; 5 mIU/ml ) ; Women childbearing potential ( WOCBP ) without reliable contraception .</criteria>
