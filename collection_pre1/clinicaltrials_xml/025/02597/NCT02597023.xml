	<criteria>Women confirm postmenopausal ( either natural surgical ) base cessation menses &gt; 1 year . Ability provide inform consent Baseline brachial flowmediated dilation ( FMD ) &lt; 6 % Î” ( rationale : noninvasive screening ensure exclusion subject exceptionally high baseline endothelial function . Ability perform motor cognitive test ( e.g. , rise chair , walk 2 min , climb 10 stair ) Willing accept random assignment condition Current smoking Having past present alcohol dependence abuse , define American Psychiatry Association , Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders Body mass index ( BMI ) &gt; 40 kg/m2 ( FMD measurement inaccurate severely obese patient ) Chronic clinical disease ( e.g. , coronary artery/peripheral artery/cerebrovascular disease , diabetes , chronic kidney disease require dialysis , neurological disorder disease may affect motor/cognitive function [ multiple sclerosis , Parkinson 's disease , polio , Alzheimer 's disease , dementia brain disease age ] ) , except hypertension hyperlipidemia Regular vigorous aerobic/endurance exercise ( &gt; 3 vigorous bouts/week ) . Not weight stable prior 3 month ( &gt; 2 kg weight change ) unwilling remain weight stable throughout study ( rationale : recent weight change weight loss influence vascular function . Current treatment recent cessation ( &lt; 3 mo ) hormone replacement therapy Moderate severe peripheral artery disease ( anklebrachial index &lt; 0.7 ) . A graded exercise test perform subject , physician concern adverse event , subject participate maximal oxygen consumption ( VO2max ) test ( determine accordance state contraindication exercise test provide American Heart Association ) . Thyroid disease control medication &lt; 3 month 's use particular medication and/or dosage ( uncontrolled thyroid disease associate alteration vascular function ) .</criteria>
