	<brief_summary>The purpose study advancement biospecimens ( blood cellular free component , e.g. , plasma , serum , tissue ) , order develop precision medicine , lung cancer management lung cancer screening ( synergy imaging ) . A co-clinical trial approach , integrative analysis leverage data treatment genetic mouse model lung cancer along clinical sample data lung cancer patient , use elucidate genomic background metric , identify cell free DNA mutation , refine liquid biopsy approach .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Feasibility Study Further Development Lung Cancer-based Precision Medicine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This feasibility study collect tumor peripheral blood patient advance NSCLC receive treatment . Blood also collect subject without lung cancer ass non cancer profile . To conduct study , total 30 study-eligible subject race ethnicity , age 18 year old diagnosis Stage IV adenocarcinoma lung ( Cohort A ) , enrol tumor collect molecular profiling xenograft development blood collect prespecified time interval completion treatment liquid biopsy analysis ( targeted sequencing , whole exome sequencing , whole genome sequencing ) . A total 60 study-eligible subject race ethnicity age 18 year old enrol non-lung cancer control subgroups chronic inflammatroy disorder ( Cohort B ) , smoker risk develop lung cancer ( Cohort C ) .</detailed_description>
