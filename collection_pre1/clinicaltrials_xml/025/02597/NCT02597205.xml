	<detailed_description>Background : Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) affect half individual lifetime.CVD lead cause non-communicable disease ( NCD ) death , project increase 15 % worldwide 2010 2020 . A wealth evidence international guideline support use low-cost , evidence-based medication , management establish CVD . Study aim : 1 . To develop test usability multifaceted , information-technology intervention among patient history myocardial infarction ( MI ) healthcare provider . 2 . To develop , contextualize assess efficacy patient-directed text message mean improve medication adherence among myocardial Infraction patient Shanghai , China . 3 . To test usability efficacy text message reminder aim modify major health risk behavior include smoke diet among MI patient . Methods : Study design overview : This short-term , quasi-experimental , pre-post intervention study design evaluate feasibility effectiveness use mobile phone app text messaging mean improve adherence medication secondary prevention , promote behavior change , reduce risk factor among MI patient . Study set study team : The study go conduct Shanghai Haikou , Hainan , China . There four academic collaborating institution study : Global Health Research Center , Duke Kunshan University ( DKU ) , China , Population Health Research Institution ( PHRI ) , Canada School Public Health , Fudan University , China Hainan Nongken General Hospital , China . The DKU research team play lead role design study , develop app message oversee entire implementation process . The PHRI research team primarily work DKU research team physician-facing app patient-facing message development . The Fudan Hainan research team responsible local implementation . Pre-intervention preparation : Development provider software application : To understand actual need barrier physician face use app , DKU research team conduct assessment among physician three community healthcare center . The assessment do short survey key informant interview . Information survey interview inform app design development decision . Development patient-centered message bank : The DKU research team work PHRI research team develop message bank literature review search . The message bank cover five domain help MI patient medical adherence lifestyle modification : 1 ) medical adherence ; 2 ) diet ; 3 ) exercise ; 4 ) smoking cessation ; 5 ) general heart health ( see appendix 4 message ) . To contextualize message ensure comprehensibility patient , Fudan Hainan research team invite physician validate message ( see appendix 5 message validation survey ) . Physicians ask score message term likability comprehensibility . Two message domain low score delete . Considering read text might difficult patient , voice message option also available patient choose . The content texts voice message identical . Intervention : The study design two intervention target physician patient respectively . Only one community healthcare center receive intervention intervention period design 12 week . The Fudan Hainan research team responsible recruiting physician physician recruit MI patient participate study . Physicians play dual role study : 1 ) subject use app prescribe medication 2 ) collaborator help recruit patient collect baseline data . The DKU research team train physician use app start recruit patient . 1 . Provider-level intervention : Physicians use smart phone application , specifically design study , help medication prescription patient recruitment . The prescription recommendation base NICE ( National Institute Health Care Excellence ) guideline 2014 MI secondary prevention . 2 . Patient-level intervention : Patients eligible participate receive automate , periodic evidence-based text message consistent medication use lifestyle modification via text-messaging . They receive standard ongoing care well regular unidirectional text message via text voice message 12 week period . Process Evaluation : Qualitative research method use obtain feedback provider patient physician app short messaging system ( SMS ) . To assess whether intervention implement plan gain user feedback , DKU , Fudan Hainan research team conduct phone face-to-face interview respectively middle end intervention . All question open-ended allow participant raise important issue even cover original topic guide . Four physician eight patient ( two physician ) invite participate process evaluation interview . The mid-term evaluation ( 4-6 week intervention begin ) one-on-one in-depth interview . The final-term evaluation consist one focus group discussion among four physician individual interview patient . Data management analysis : Questionnaires require translation cod data analysis occur . In addition cod translation , interview focus group record require transcription . All data entry perform Fudan Hainan research team occur close time data collection ensure accuracy . Descriptive analysis use describe rate adherence among patient . Percentage difference proportion patient adhered medication use adhere medication use compare . Characteristics compare baseline follow-up use independent test continuous variable ( physical activity diet ) chi-square test categorical variable ( smoke status ) . Analyses perform use stata , version 12 . Lastly , interview focus group transcription cod emerge theme use QSR Nvivo . Risks benefit : This study offer participant prospect direct benefit : 1 ) may potentially improve patient medical adherence ; 2 ) may potentially help patient build healthy lifestyle ; 3 ) may give guidance physician evidence-based medicine prescription ; 4 ) may facilitate interaction patient physician . No foreseeable risk anticipate physician . As patient , one concern exercise promotion message , take without caution , may degree increase risk heart attack patient . To eliminate concern , text message suggest patient consult doctor first take exercise reduce risk minimal . The risk possible breach confidentiality address use vigorous method protect identity subject . After data collect , enter , digitize , investigator store identifiable information separate data set remove information main database ( information collect pre-intervention stage ) . The app generate unique identification number ( ID ) physician patient confidentiality use . Linkage study ID perform necessary . Baseline follow-up survey link study ID . As information collect app , access without enter password set physician . Only physicians , programmer DKU research team member access necessary .</detailed_description>
