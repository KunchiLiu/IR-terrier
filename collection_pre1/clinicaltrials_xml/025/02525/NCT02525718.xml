	<detailed_description>One eight woman develop breast cancer lifetime , many woman undergo mastectomy follow breast reconstruction insertion tissue expander pectoralis major muscle . Women undergo breast reconstruction show significantly high level acute postoperative pain postoperative narcotic requirement compare woman undergo mastectomy alone without reconstruction . In addition inherently worthwhile end provide patient comfort immediate postoperative period , decrease narcotic use carry potential benefit decrease incidence adverse effect nausea , vomit , allergic reaction , respiratory depression . Importantly , intensity pain immediate postoperative period implicate important factor predispose patient development chronic postoperative pain . Chronic pain follow mastectomy significant disabling problem , affect 49 % patient series . Though breast reconstruction show independent predictor development chronic breast pain , improve control acute pain immediate postoperative period carry significant promise decrease incidence disable condition breast cancer survivor treat mastectomy . In addition , improve management acute postoperative pain shorten hospital stay , expedite return daily normal activity increase patient satisfaction . A variety adjuncts pain control attempt study variable methodological rigor , include injection botulinum toxin pectoralis muscle , indwell pain catheter , paravertebral block ultrasound guidance , simple irrigation general area dissection breast surgery solution contain local anesthestic . While adjunct demonstrate success , none widely adopt . Problems method include cost , risk adverse event , well anatomically incomplete non-selective application . During mastectomy breast tissue remove , leave patient denervated skin flap . For breast reconstruction , tissue expander place subpectoral pocket dissect pectoralis major minor muscle . At end procedure pectoralis major muscle place variable degree tension depend amount fluid place inside expander . This muscle stretch believe least partially responsible postoperative pain . In addition cut nerve ending superficial fascia likely contribute well . The anatomy nerve supply breast involved muscle well-described rigorous cadaver study . In study hypothesize perform block intercostal nerve responsible innervate breast tissue skin pectoral nerve innervate pectoralis major muscle optimize immediate postoperative pain control patient population . Of adjunct describe literature , paravertebral block anatomically target , drawback include need separate procedure preoperatively patient awake anesthesiologist facility perform block well risk pneumothorax . Advantages propose method include lack pain patient asleep , easy speed application , decrease risk pneumothorax injection direct visualization , well decrease cost improved efficiency single provider ( i.e . operative surgeon ) require . Precedent technique describe context breast augmentation breast lift , favorable safety profile provide adequate analgesia perform procedure without use general anesthetic .</detailed_description>
