	<brief_summary>Cardiac resynchronisation therapy ( CRT ) document powerful treatment patient severe congestive heart failure . However , 30-40 % patient receive CRT non-responders . In study investigator use previously validate method estimate myocardial segment work non-invasively speckle-tracking echocardiography blood pressure . Since segment shorten systole perform positive work , whereas segment lengthen negative work , investigator calculate waste work negative work percentage positive work . The main purpose study determine waste work predict response CRT .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Subject indicate CRT device accord current European Society Cardiology ( ESC ) guideline ( 2013 ) : Before CRT consider , patient receive guidelinedirected optimal medical therapy heart failure LV function must severely depressed ( LVEF â‰¤35 % ) . In addition follow criterion must fulfil : 1 . NYHA functional class II , III ambulatory IV stable sinus rhythm last two week . 2 . ECG : Left Bundle Branch Block ( LBBB ) QRS duration &gt; 120 m nonLBBB QRS &gt; 150 m . Patient conventional pacemaker NYHA functional class III ambulatory IV high percentage ventricular pacing . Subject willing sign inform consent form 18 year old . Right bundle branch block . Permanent atrial fibrillation Recent myocardial infarction , within 40 day prior enrollment . Subject underwent coronary artery bypass graft ( CABG ) valve surgery , within 90 day . Post heart transplantation , actively list transplantation list , reasonable probability ( per investigator 's discretion ) undergo transplantation next year Implanted LV assist device ( LVAD ) , reasonable probability ( per investigator 's discretion ) receive LVAD next year Severe aortic stenosis ( valve area &lt; 1.0 cm2 significant valve disease expect operate within study period ) . Complex uncorrected congenital heart disease . Breastfeeding woman woman child bear potential . Enrolled one concurrent study would confound result study . Impossible obtain LV volume echocardiography</criteria>
