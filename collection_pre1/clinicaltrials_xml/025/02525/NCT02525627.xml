	<detailed_description>This single centre randomize clinical outcome study . The Symax stem Accolade TMZF ( Titan , Molybdenum , Zirconium , Ferrum ) combination Hemispherical Trident cup , X3 insert , 28 40 mm Metal head primary component implant evaluation .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Male non pregnant female patient 1875 year age . 2 . Patients require uncemented primary total hip arthroplasty ( THA ) , suitable use Symax stem 3 . Patients diagnosis osteoarthritis ( OA ) , rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) , avascular necrosis ( AVN ) posttraumatic arthritis ( TA ) . 4 . Patients understand condition study willing able comply postoperative schedule clinical radiographic evaluation prescribe rehabilitation 5 . Patients sign specific Informed Consent Form prior surgery 1 . Patients require revision previously implant THA 2 . Patients THA contralateral side within last 1 year . 3 . Patients THA contralateral side 1 year ago rehabilitation period outcome consider unsatisfactory good . ( Patients contralateral THA &gt; 1 year ago good outcome ( Harris Hip Score &gt; 85 ) include study ) . 4 . Patients need low limb joint replacement another joint within one year . 5 . Bilaterally operated patient . 6 . Patients prior procedure acetabular osteotomy . 7 . Patients active suspected infection . 8 . Patients malignancy active malignancy 9 . Patients diagnosed systemic disease would affect subject 's welfare overall outcome study ( i.e . severe osteoporosis , Paget 's disease , renal osteodystrophy ) immunologically suppress , receive steroid excess physiologic dose requirement . 10 . The patient neuromuscular neurosensory deficit would limit ability assess performance device patient neurological deficit interfere patient 's ability limit weight bear place extreme load implant healing period . 11 . Female patient plan pregnancy course study . 12 . Patients systemic metabolic disorder lead progressive bone deterioration . 13 . Patients , judge surgeon , mentally incompetent unlikely compliant prescribe postoperative routine followup evaluation schedule . 14 . Patients severe concurrent joint involvement affect outcome . 15 .
