	<brief_title>A Phase 1 Study Evaluating Safety , Tolerability Pharmacokinetics Trebananib ( AMG 386 ) Adult Japanese Participants With Advanced Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The drug test study call trebananib ( AMG 386 ) . Trebananib ( AMG 386 ) test treat people advance solid tumor . This study look safety , tolerability pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile trebananib response treatment . The study enroll approximately 18 participant . Once enrol , participant assign sequentially 1 3 cohort : - Trebananib 3 milligram/kilogram ( mg/kg ) , - Trebananib 10 mg/kg , - Trebananib 30 mg/kg . All participant receive trebananib via 60 minute intravenous infusion . This study conduct Japan . The overall time participate study 14 week . Participants attend end-of-treatment visit 28 day last dose study drug .</detailed_description>
