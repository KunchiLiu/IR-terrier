	<detailed_description>OVERALL STUDY DESIGN : This phase IV , multinational , multicentre , open-label , non-randomized , clinical trial conduct Europe ( Spain , Germany , Finland , Norway , Romania Austria ) evaluate safety profile ADASUVE® agitate patient schizophrenia bipolar disorder self-administered outside hospital set without supervision healthcare professional . The Study aim include approximately 500 patient previously treat ADASUVE® last 6 month prior screen recently treat planned recruitment period 6 month 'positive outcome ' ( 'ADASUVE® responder ' ) accord Clinical Global Impressions ( CGI-I ) scale , total 30-34 center . An 'ADASUVE® responder ' define CGI-I score 2 hour administration either 1 ( much improve ) 2 ( much improve ) . All patient follow maximum 6 month baseline , expect new episode agitation occur . Centers select qualify primarily base estimate number eligible patient . The patient attend hospital setting , Hospital Wards , Emergency Rooms , Day Care Units , Hospital Home-care unit , Institutions agitation episode treatment recruit . Site study staff screen patient potential participation clinical study time presentation hospital set on-going agitation episode recruitment period 6 month , retrospectively previous one episode within 6 month prior screen . The study staff review patient 's medical record detail determine eligibility . There baseline hospital visit within 2 4 week screen pre-selected patient . This hospital visit schedule resolution episode patient pre-selected on-going agitation episode . Patients previous agitation episode call phone site staff ensure meet eligibility requirement enrol plan baseline visit . At screen patient family ( caregiver ) inform study staff baseline visit receive specific training session proper self-administration ADASUVE® outside hospital setting procedure relate study . At baseline visit , select patient ask provide sign informed consent inclusion study study relate procedure . Once informed consent obtain eligibility criterion confirm ( include negative result urine pregnancy test perform woman childbearing potential family member caregiver support place ) patient inclusion . Once patient include study : - He/she receive one unit ADASUVE® treat next agitation episode outside hospital setting ( plus short-acting beta-agonist bronchodilator treatment possible severe respiratory side effect [ i.e bronchospasm ] ) . - Patients presence family member caregiver receive specific training session properly self-administration ADASUVE® outside hospital set clear indication identify appearance agitation crisis , base recognition escalate symptom experience previous agitation episode . - Additional educational material provide patient document include : Patient information card recognition symptom agitation , instruction study , information recognition respiratory symptom instruction use medicine treat . - The patient 's diary card also deliver patient ( family member/caregiver ) . - Patient train use patient ' diary card register agitation episode information . Each patient include study receive study kit contain : one unit ADASUVE® next agitation episode ( plus short-acting beta-agonist bronchodilator rescue medication treat severe respiratory symptom ) , instruction use ADASUVE® , ADASUVE® storage instruction , patient 's diary card educational material . The patient 's kit also include useful instruction ADASUVE® storage store lock cool , dry place away direct sunlight , keep reach child , use expiry date state product label , discard household waste keep pouch time use . At baseline follow data obtain retrospectively medical record patient record electronic case report form : demographic , diagnosis , agitation information current/previous episode ( date/time onset , time improvement patient status rate 2h ADASUVE® administration [ CGI-I scale ] ) , respiratory disease history risk factor , co morbidities/medical history ( non-respiratory ) , concomitant medication , previous ADASUVE® treatment ( date dose data ) . During 6-month follow-up baseline visit study staff conduct 10-minutes phone-calls ( every 3 month approximately ) enrol patient family member/caregiver . Patients ( family member/caregiver ) ask general patient health status . In addition , patient remind return medication present new episode agitation 6 month follow-up baseline visit . All patient schedule study staff end study visit aim return unused study kit . These patient exclude study . All related information record electronic case report form . Three clinical scenario occur follow self-administration ADASUVE® outside hospital set treatment acute agitation episode : • If improvement within 2-hours post-dose self-administration ADASUVE® outside hospital set episode acute agitation dismiss , follow data collect patient 's diary card adequate family ( caregiver ) support : Date diary completion , person complete diary ( patient , relatives caregiver ) , date/time onset current episode agitation , date/time ADASUVE® self-administration , , severity episode ( CGI-S scale ) ADASUVE® administration time/rate improvement current episode agitation ( CGI-I scale ) score 2 , 10 , 20 , 30 , 60 120 minute ADASUVE® administration , AEs relate ADASUVE® follow 24 hour self-administration , medication treat ADASUVE® treatment-emergent AEs ( e.g. , short-acting bronchodilator ) another medication use follow 24 hour ADASUVE® administration . Once ADASUVE® treatment take place , immediately patient ( family member/caregiver ) must inform correspond study investigator schedule follow-up hospital visit ( within 24-72h ADASUVE® self-administration ) . The 24-72h follow-up visit ADASUVE® self-administration study investigator include review data patient diary card record electronic case report form investigator staff . Additionally , study investigator confirm visit patient good general health base judgment patient ask evaluate treatment satisfaction self-administered ADASUVE® outside hospital set use 5-point Likert scale . - If improvement worsen agitation 1 hour ADASUVE® self-administration outside hospital setting , patient must attend assigned hospital 2nd dose ADASUVE® ( ≥ 2 hour dose one ) another medication treat agitation episode , discretion investigator . If additionally , patient report AE first administration ADASUVE® outside hospital set second dose ADASUVE® administer , another medication dispense hospital setting treat agitation episode . - If ≥2 hour ADASUVE® self-administration outside hospital set worsen agitation episode ( previous improvement within 2-hours post-dose administration ) , patient must attend assigned hospital 2nd dose ADASUVE® another medication treat agitation episode , discretion investigator . The following data discharge collect electronic case report form study staff improvement worsen self-administration ADASUVE® patient attend hospital : - Other treatment administer agitation episode addition 1st dose ADASUVE® self-administered outside hospital set 2nd dose ADASUVE® hospital administration non-responders patient ( number timing dos administer ) - Other treatment administer agitation addition 2nd dose ADASUVE® . - Date/time onset current episode agitation - Time onset improvement current episode - AEs relate ADASUVE® - Medications and/or intervention treat ADASUVE® treatment-emergent AEs - Status discharge ( admission hospital , discharge home facility , ongoing hospitalization , leave medical advice , ) All patient self-administered ADASUVE® outside hospital set return use study kit schedule visit accordingly . Furthermore , patient receive follow-up call 30 day self-administration ADASUVE® outside hospital setting record general health status patient include information AEs relate ADASUVE® experienced period .</detailed_description>
