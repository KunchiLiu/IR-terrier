	<brief_summary>The main objective study investigate role female sex hormone relation insulin resistance control human experimental model menopause explore whether exercise and/or hormone treatment ( HT ) compensate loss endogenous sex hormone production maintain insulin sensitivity metabolic activity level equivalent see premenopausal woman . Loss ovarian function associate increase incidence metabolic disease include metabolic syndrome , type 2 diabetes cardiovascular disease . This increase disease incidence seem relate change body composition include decreased skeletal muscle mass increase visceral fat mass well decreased whole body fat oxidation energy expenditure . Regular physical activity decrease general mortality among thing increase fat free mass insulin sensitivity hereby prevent metabolic syndrome cardiovascular disease - condition see increase incidence menopause could therefore possible treatment . In present study Investigators ass role sex hormone model menopause healthy woman undergo planned bilateral oophorectomy due risk hereditary ovary cancer . The use model make possible control time point loss ovarian function hereby investigate timeframe possible contribute factor strictly control model . 48 premenopausal woman include study . The study conduct woman already offer surgical oophorectomy . The first 2 month study observational cohort study . Hereafter patient allocate one four group ( n=12 ) randomize control trial , address effect 6 month exercise without HT . Type surgery decide inclusion base medical indication . The woman offer HT accord national guideline , choice . Randomization apply train intervention . Firstly Investigators aim investigate role endogenous female sex hormone HT relation insulin resistance , whole body fat oxidation -energy expenditure , change visceral fat mass fat free mass oophorectomy . Secondly , Investigators wish study molecular mechanism behind oophorectomy-induced insulin resistance focus insulin signal skeletal muscle fat tissue . Lastly , investigator aim explore whether exercise and/or HT compensate loss endogenous female sex hormone production maintaining IS metabolic activity , hereby prevent future incident metabolic disease relation menopause . All , project contribute new knowledge concern question endogenous female sex hormone affect insulin sensitivity metabolic functioning exercise may use disease preventive modality middle-aged woman .</brief_summary>
