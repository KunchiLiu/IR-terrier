	<brief_title>Online Cognitive Training PD , MS Depressed Patients Treated With Electroconvulsive Therapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In neurodegenerative disorder psychiatric disorder , cognitive dysfunction frequently report . In Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) , Multiple Sclerosis ( MS ) patient treat electroconvulsive therapy severe therapy resistant depression ( postECT ) , executive dysfunction , attention deficit episodic/autobiographic memory deficit prevalent . In MS PD , dysfunction appear already early disease . The majority PD patient - lifetime prevalence 80 % - develop PD dementia . In MS , half patient experience problem cognitive function . ECT use treat patient severe and/or therapy resistant depression . However , 30-50 % patient develop severe cognitive dysfunction . Recovery usually occur within six month ECT . However , performance remain below-average compare norm group large individual difference . The cognitive difficulty MS PD significant negative influence quality life . Cognitive dysfunction PD associate decreased independent daily functioning , hospitalization development severity neuropsychiatric symptom . Furthermore , clinic cognitive dysfunction report one dreadful side effect ECT . However , effective treatment describe cognitive dysfunction still infancy . Cognitive training base upon principle plasticity brain facilitate function improvement intensive training . In several neurological disease , cognitive training show significant improvement cognitive function . In MS PD , early study small , frequently without adequately control design . Additionally , earlier cognitive training program frequently execute health care organization , impair patient successfully attend train session due mobility impairment . Also , limited study effect cognitive training improve functioning daily live neuropsychiatric symptom like anxiety depression . Given fact absence cognitive training study patient post-ECT , knowledge ability cognitive training speed natural course . Using pilot study , investigator aim study feasibility randomize control trial use online computerize intervention train cognitive ability three patient group . By use double-blinded , control study design , investigator keep mind limitation earlier comparable study . If treatment prove feasible , rough estimate effect size positive , large randomize control trial execute study effectivity treatment . When effect positive , online cognitive training programme could prove cost-efficient intervention accessible home - something important patient mobility problem . The investigator hypothesize patient use online cognitive training improve cognitive function , compare patient use active training condition .</detailed_description>
