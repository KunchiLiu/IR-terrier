	<brief_title>The Influence Resection Margin Recurrence Early-stage Hepatocellular Carcinoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Although liver resection still first line treatment hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) presently , 5-year overall recurrence rate &gt; 70 % , early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma , study report rate &gt; 40 % . Recurrence also first cause death patient , recurrence important factor affect surgical result HCC . For precaution cancer recurrence , proven techniques clinical reference present . For , many controversy impact width liver resection margin curative effect . Poon proven significant difference recurrence rate resection margin &gt; 1cm resection margin &lt; 1cm . However , Shi et al publish randomize control trial : patient solitary tumor , resection margin &gt; 2cm reduce recurrence rate hepatectomy . This also randomized clinical trial study prove increase resection margin benefit clinical result present . A meta analysis consist 18 study prove whether resection margin relationship benefit clinical result still need verification . On hand , microvascular invasion ( MVI ) direct evidence micro metastasis hepatocellular carcinoma , decrease recurrence rate patient high MVI risk , investigator increase resection margin width surgery ? Shanghai Eastern Hepatobiliary Surgery Hospital investigator affiliate ever conduct retrospective analysis consecutive 3263 patient HCC hepatectomy , result indicate wide resection margin（≥1cm）can benefit patient microvascular invasion , nevertheless , benefit present patient without microvascular invasion . Further good proof still need approval consequence , course . In past，another study , publish online Journal American Medical Association Surgery , establish nomogram predict presence microvascular invasion early-stage hepatocellular carcinoma , efficiently predict occurrence microvascular invasion hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) fulfil Milan criterion . In consideration basis , investigator implement randomize controlled trial certificate whether could really reduce recurrence rate liver resection participant high MVI risk surgery , method participant choose wide resection margin .</detailed_description>
