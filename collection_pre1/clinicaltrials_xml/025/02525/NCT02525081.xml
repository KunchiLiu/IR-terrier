	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND Microvascular angina propose myocardial ischemia cause microvascular dysfunction . When microvasculature dysfunctioning , blood flow coronary vessel increase sufficiently meet oxygen demand lead ischemia pain . In absence stenosis major coronary artery , coronary flow reserve ( CFR ) reflect coronary microcirculation . Up 50 % patient angina obstructive coronary artery disease ( CAD ) impair CFR , strong predictor poor cardiovascular prognosis . Furthermore CFR show associated conventional risk factor ; among hypertension . ACE-inhibitor treatment patient Angina Pectoris and/or essential hypertension stenosis coronary angiogram improve CFR measure invasively Doppler Guidewire gas chromotography suggest effect ACE inhibition microvasculature . Studies assess effect ACE-inhibition hypertensive mild coronary artery disease patient CFR assess positron emission tomography ( PET ) show divergent result . One study show improvement rest hyperaemic myocardial blood flow , another show increase myocardial perfusion reserve post treatment third fail show significant effect . If effect see CFR indirectly mediate via treatment hypertension ACE-inhibition direct effect microvasculature continue uncertain patient microvascular angina . Some study show effect CFR normotensive hypertensive patient microvascular angina whereas study show effect hypertensive patient normotensive . Treating patient diabetes CFR &gt; 2.0 ACE-inhibitor also proven efficient increase CFR measure transthoracic Doppler echocardiography ( TTDE ) support theory ACE-inhibition could direct effect microvasculature . In animal study ACE-inhibition show capability prevent adverse vascular remodelling dissociate blood pressure lower effect . ACE inhibitor treatment think associate vascular change CAD patient . However Clinical trial show discrepant result regard reduction hard endpoint ACE inhibition high-risk CAD patient . It remain unclear ACE-inhibition direct effect microvasculature normotensive patient microvascular angina . Endothelial dysfunction assess Flow-dependent endothelium-mediated dilation ( FMD ) associate cardiovascular risk factor prominent woman . FMD predict long term cardiovascular event healthy subject . Treatment type ACE-inhibitors improves FMD show study patient syndrome X , coronary artery disease , hypertension healthy elderly . However Enalapril treatment show affect FMD . AIM The aim study explore effect long term treatment ACE-inhibitor microvasculature endothelial function assess coronary flow reserve ( CFR ) transthoracic echocardiography flow mediate dilation ( FMD ) normotensive patient microvascular dysfunction ( CFR &lt; 2.2 ) Angina Pectoris NO-CAD . HYPOTHESIS ACE inhibitor treatment revert microvascular remodelling endothelial dysfunction patient microvascular dysfunction Angina Pectoris NO-CAD thereby improve microvascular function reduce symptom . RESEARCH DESIGN The study randomise double-blinded interventional study . 72 patient microvascular dysfunction assess TTDE CFR &lt; 2.2 recruit iPower ( ImProve diagnOsis treatment Women angina pEctoris micRovessel disease ) cohort ( woman angina obstructive CAD examine TTDE CFR ) , Region Zealand . Patients hypertension exclude study . The patient randomise group 1 2 : 1 . Group 1 : Oral ACE-inhibitor 6±1,5 month 2 . Group 2 : Oral match placebo 6±1,5 month Examinations measurement perform baseline 6±1,5 month . There furthermore 2 possible blood pressure ( BP ) /kidney function control visit depend many titration treatment medicine necessary individual patient . Compliance call control adverse event make every month patient also contact u concern . Participation study 6±1,5 month . 24 hour final measurement Ramipril treatment discontinue . Ramipril treatment add-on usual treatment . RANDOMIZATION PROCEDURE Patients randomize 2 equal group receive either Ramipril placebo . Randomization do pharmacy ( Glostrup Apotek ) . ACIM ( Effect ACE-Inhibition Microvascular Function Women Assessed Microvascular Dysfunction ) Id-numbers ( ACIM1-72 ) allocate equally either placebo Ramipril treatment use simple randomization . Randomization conceal document seal opaque envelope reveal end study . For individual patient occurrence serious adverse event sponsor investigator contact pharmacy reveal medication type . The sealed envelope lock cabinet office sponsor . The sponsor , investigator , research assistant patient knowledge randomization group patient belong Id-numbers ( ACIM1-72 ) allocate patient consecutive order . TRIAL MEDICINE AND BLINDING Study medication prepare pharmacy ( Glostrup Apotek ) double-blinded manner . Medication deliver bottle contain 50/100 x 5 mg placebo tablet 5 mg Ramipril ( Ramipril® , Hexal ) bottle container tablet indistinguishable . Tablets produce pressure sensitive score notch divide equal half . Bottle container label study id-number ACIM1-ACIM72 ( identification number/treatment number ) , batch and/or code number identify content package operation , name investigator Marie Michelsen/research assistant mobile number , pharmaceutical dosage form , route administration , quantity dosage unit , indication use : `` clinical trial '' , storage condition , period use ( expiry date ) warn label : `` keep reach child '' . The direction use make leaflet accord individual dosage different final dosage titration . In placebo Ramipril group medication start either 2,5 mg ( BP &lt; 130 ) 5 mg ( BP &gt; 130 ) daily . After 2-3 week dose double 5 mg 10 mg unless blood pressure 115 mmHg . If blood pressure continue high 115 mmHg patient titrate 5 mg treatment dose double 10 mg third visit . Blood pressure kidney function control visit ( see fig . 1 ) . If patient symptoms hypotension ( dizziness , syncope high pulse ) treatment dose reduce and/or blood pressure lower treatment discontinue necessary Ramipril treatment discontinue . If oral ACE-inhibitors tolerate treatment discontinue . Regarding exclusion treatment discontinuation please see `` withdrawal criterion '' . Patients take dose - 2,5 mg take half tablet day - 5 mg take one whole tablet day - 10 mg take two tablet day Patients titrate manner independent medication . For study id-number medication titration available . Patients receive appropriate amount bottle accord uptitrated dose level ( annex 1 ) . Patients titrate monitored research assistant investigator make primary endpoint measure unaware final treatment dose . In case adverse events/reactions serious events/reactions research assistant confer sponsor project physician necessary investigator avoid awareness medication type person obtain primary endpoint . Only case suspect serious reaction medication type unblinded sponsor investigator call pharmacy , Døgnåbent Glostrup Apotek , patient id/cpr-number . Regarding exclusion unblinding please see `` withdrawal criterion '' . Analysis echocardiographic measurement primary secondary measurement make minimum 1 month baseline final visit investigator unaware blood pressure measurement examination . Control compliance make visit hereafter every month patient structure open question interview ( visit telephone ) Furthermore patient make diary every day pill intake symptom ( potential adverse effect ) . At end study patient return use pill container remain tablet within . These counted ensure medication compliance accuracy .</detailed_description>
