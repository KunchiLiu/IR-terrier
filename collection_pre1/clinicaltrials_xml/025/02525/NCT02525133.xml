	<brief_summary>This Phase 3 , multicenter , randomize , double-blind , parallel-group , placebo-controlled efficacy safety study postoperative pain adult schedule unilateral inguinal hernioplasty via open laparotomy ( tension-free technique ) . Patients assess postoperative pain intensity ( PI ) use 11-point numerical rating scale ( NRS ) 0 hour 72 hour postoperatively . The expected maximum study duration patient 60 day , include maximum 30-day screening period , day surgery implantation , 30-day post implantation period include treatment follow-up .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phase 3 Study Efficacy Safety XaraColl® Bupivacaine Implant After Hernioplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase 3 , multicenter , randomize , double-blind , parallel-group , placebo-controlled study adult schedule unilateral inguinal hernioplasty via open laparotomy ( tension-free technique ) . Patients receive either 3 XaraColl Bupivacaine Implants contain 100 mg bupivacaine hydrochloride , 300 mg total dose ; 3 placebo-sponges . Three test article sponge implant accord patient 's blinded treatment assignment . Following surgery , patient transfer postanesthesia care unit ( PACU ) and/or postoperative recovery area observation may receive parenteral morphine need ( rescue medication breakthrough pain ) request pain control . Once patient tolerate oral medication , commence standardize oral analgesic regimen additional PRN medication manage breakthrough pain occurs . Patients assess postoperative pain intensity ( PI ) use 11-point numerical rating scale ( NRS ) 0 hour 72 hour postoperatively . Patients observe postoperatively minimum 3 hour may discharge time follow completion 3-hour vital sign PI assessment . Patients contact approximately 6 , 24 48 hour implantation ensure protocol compliance perform safety assessment ( include AEs concomitant medication ) . At 72 hour , patient return clinic perform final PI assessment , complete categorical assessment overall pain control , follow-up safety assessment . They also ask record incidence ongoing subsequent AEs ( associate treatment ) Day 7 . Additional follow-up assessment safety perform postoperative Day 7 ( telephone call ) Days 15 30 ( clinic visit ) .</detailed_description>
