	<brief_title>HT-100 Long-term Study DMD Patients Who Completed HALO-DMD-02</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>As follow-on study initial clinical study HT-100 DMD ( Protocols HALO-DMD-01 HALO-DMD-02 ) , open-label study design provide data continuous long-term dosing . Subjects enter study without cessation dosing , staggered fashion , cohort assignment predecessor study . Up 30 subject complete dose HALO-DMD-02 offer opportunity continue dose regimen market approval HT-100 termination study Sponsor . Reasons termination could include , among others , safety concern lack efficacy , base analysis combine data HT-100 study . Safety data subject approach end HALO-DMD-02 participation individually review Medical Monitor subject 's physician ( Principal Investigator [ PI ] ) . If Medical Monitor PI agree clinically significant safety signal ( absence clinically significant laboratory clinical abnormality date ) , subject consider eligible offer continuation dose . To avoid interruption dosing , subject immediately screen participation enrol upon complete predecessor trial , HALO-DMD-02 . Participation study HALO-DMD-03 optional . Safety pharmacodynamics ( PD ) monitoring continue throughout subject 's study participation . Dose reduction/modification might occur individual subject ' participation trial may discontinue Adverse Events ( AEs ) suggest HT-100 sufficiently well tolerate .</detailed_description>
