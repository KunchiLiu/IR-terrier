	<brief_summary>A placebo-controlled , randomize , double-blind , parallel group , phase III multicenter study subject recently hospitalize ACS appropriate genetic profile . Subjects provide informed consent study-specific procedure perform . Subject enrollment may begin hospital continue follow release hospital . Screening procedure may perform time index ACS event anytime thereafter , condition randomization must occur within mandate window ( 4-12 week index event ) . Subjects assess base medical history . Those likely qualify undergo Genotype Assay test evaluate genetic determination presence AA genotype .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This event driven study reach statistical power give assumption . Subjects visit clinic 1 month randomization regular interval thereafter . Additionally , subject prematurely discontinue study medication , assessment conduct every 6 month collection study endpoint . Those likely qualify undergo Genotype Assay Testing evaluate genetic determination presence AA genotype .
