	<detailed_description>This match case-control study identify genetic susceptibility factor Ankylosing Spondylitis ( AS ) . Patients family control select 154 family include genome-wide linkage screening , comprise 440 patient 904 individual genotyped use microarrays Affymetrix® 250,000 single-nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) . For locus , family LOD score 0 ; 15 predefined region retain . In family select patient healthy control sex , possible , sibling comparable age ( &lt; 10 year apart ) . The patient control contact mail / telephone obtain participation study . An updating Questionnaire AS event send , particularly check family control develop AS since inclusion genetic study . Patient family control recruitment obtain dendritic cell ( DC ) make first year . After sign informed consent , 60ml whole blood take include subject . The cell obtain blood sample ( leukocyte ) culture laboratory seven day use extract RNA use conduct research . Some cell well RNA frozen thaw later use require . Mononuclear cell isolated whole blood gradient centrifugation ( Ficoll ) . CD14 + monocytes select label anti-CD14 antibody couple ferromagnetic bead ( Dynabeads ) magnet system Dynal , differentiate presence GM-CSF ( Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor ) IL-4 ( Interleukine 4 ) 6 day immature DC ( dendritic cell ) , accord protocol validate laboratory use routine . DC maturation induce addition lipopolysaccharide E. coli ( Sigma ) 18 hour . The pellet DC retain RNAlater® extract RNA . A transcriptomic study mature DCs carry end recruitment run two month , include one month experimentation 1 month analysis . This study perform use microarrays genome-wide exon-centric expression . The analyzes perform separately locus interest bear expression gene localize region . The level transcript normalized patient family control compare group 15 control general population already obtain . For locus , gene statistically different expression group patient family control differential expression ≥ 1 identify . The expression level gene verify quantitative real-time PCR ( polymerase chain reaction ) . The positional functional candidate gene identify due differential expression transcript fully re-sequenced search polymorphism may responsible change level expression . The investigator expect study one three gene per region . The re-sequencing perform primarily patient family control different level expression gene . Polymorphisms distribute differently two population retain rest study . The re-sequencing candidate gene spread period 4 month .</detailed_description>
