	<brief_title>MPDL3280A With Chemoradiation Lung Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Groups Study Drug Administration : Each study cycle 21 day . If find eligible take part study , depend join study , assign 1 2 study group . Up 10 participant assign Group 1 30 assign Group 2 . Participants Groups 1 2 receive standard chemotherapy 1 time week radiation therapy 5 day per week describe Every cycle also receive MPDL3280A vein 1 hour . If Group 1 , receive standard chemotherapy radiation 6-7 week , follow around 3-8 week `` rest period '' receive chemotherapy radiation . If Group 2 , receive MPDL3280A , standard chemotherapy , radiation therapy 6-7 week . This follow rest period 3-4 week , time receive 1 dose MPDL3280A chemotherapy radiation . After rest period , Groups 1 2 receive MPDL3280A addition chemotherapy 2 cycle ( call consolidation period ) . After complete consolidation period , continue receive MPDL3280A alone 1 year ( call maintenance period ) . During first dose MPDL3280A , vital sign ( blood pressure , pulse , temperature , breathe rate ) measure 60 minute dose , every 15 minute dose , 30 minute dose check bad reaction study drug . You may give standard drug help side effect . If need stop receive chemotherapy due side effect , also stop receive MPDL3280A . If stop receiving chemotherapy reason , may continue receive MPDL3280A . Study Visits : Once week Weeks 1-7 : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test check liver kidney function . Between Weeks 8-16 rest period . The rest period could range 3-8 week , time return consolidation period . One ( 1 ) time consolidation period , start rest period , Weeks 1-3 Weeks 4-6 consolidation period : - You physical exam . - Blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test check liver kidney function . - You either CT scan FDG-PET/CT scan check status disease . After complete consolidation period , enter maintenance period . During every cycle maintenance period , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test . Every 2 cycle maintenance period , 1 year : - You physical exam . - You either CT scan FDG-PET/CT scan check status disease . If disease appear come back time study : - You physical exam . - You CT scan MRI brain check status disease . - You either CT scan FDG-PET/CT chest abdomen check status disease . - You biopsy suspicious area find scan check status disease . - Your doctor may choose continue study drug repeat scan 6-8 week check status disease . - If doctor feel study drug longer effective information obtain repeat scan , take study drug . You continue follow schedule determine doctor . - Your doctor may offer alternative treatment doctor feel best interest . Length Treatment : You may receive study drug 1 year start consolidation period , long doctor think best interest . You longer able receive study drug disease get bad , intolerable side effect occur , unable follow study direction . If take study consolidation maintenance period due intolerable side effect , follow study staff often doctor think need side effect get well . Your active participation study follow-up visit . Follow-up Visits : You follow-up visit every 2-4 month 2 year last dose study drug , unless leave study due side effect disease appear come back . After 2 year , follow-up visit every 4-6 month base doctor think best . At follow-up visit , follow test perform : - You physical exam . - You either CT scan FDG-PET/CT scan chest abdomen check status disease . - If doctor think need , blood ( 2 teaspoon ) draw routine test check liver kidney function . If return MD Anderson visit , may call member study staff every 3-6 month 4 year last dose study drug . Each call last 10 minute . The study staff may ask test scan do home doctor send MD Anderson check status disease . This investigational study . MPDL3280A FDA approve commercially available . It currently use research purpose . Paclitaxel , carboplatin , radiation therapy FDA approve treatment lung cancer . The use drug combination consider investigational . Up 40 participant enrol study . All take part MD Anderson .</detailed_description>
