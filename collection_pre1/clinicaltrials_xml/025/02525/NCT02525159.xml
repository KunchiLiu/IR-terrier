	<brief_summary>Breast cancer public health problem Mexico incidence rise woman still premenopausal . Estrogen metabolism link breast cancer . Several study report high concentration 2 hydroxyestrone ( 2OHE1 ) urine protective effect neoplasia , whereas high concentration 16 alpha-hydroxyestrone ( 16αOHE1 ) urine opposite effect , report woman ratio estrogen metabolite 2OHE1:16αOHE1 urine ( REMU ) less 0.9 , ten time risk develop Breast Cancer woman RMEU equal 0.9 . Other study show active compound cruciferous vegetable , indole-3-carbinol ( I3C ) dimer , 3 ' 3'diindolylmethane ( DIM ) induce benign pathway metabolism estrogens produce 2OHE1 . Several study , evaluate pharmacokinetics effect I3C supplementation , find 300 600 mg compound well tolerate able promote formation 2OHE1 woman supplement one month . In case DIM , pilot study explore effect postmenopausal woman personal history breast cancer early stage , report increase concentration 2OHE1 . The purpose study evaluate effectiveness supplementation DIM increase urinary RMEU premenopausal woman risk Breast Cancer ( RMEU less 0.9 ) . A clinical , randomize , double-blind study perform woman attend urogynecology service Institute National Perinatology . Subjects premenopausal woman 34 year healthy . The inclusion criterion 's RMEU le 0.9 exclude medical condition , medication , dietary lifestyle habit might interfere estrogen metabolism . Patients randomly assign one two group : one receive orally daily dose 75 mg DIM period 30 day group receive orally daily placebo period 30 day . All urine sample collect woman DIM placebo ingestion , 30 day DIM placebo ingestion finally another 30 day suspend supplementation . Analysis 2OHE1 16αOHE1 determine use commercially kit ESTRAMET™ . The change metabolites median concentration RMEU assess Wilcoxon test difference group U Mann-Whitney test .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Effectiveness DIM Supplements Increase 2-OHE1/16 Ratio</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study evaluate effectiveness supplementation 3,3´-Diindolylmethane ( DIM ) increase urinary ratio estrogen metabolites 2OHE1:16alphaOHE1 ( RMEU ) woman risk breast cancer contribute generate tool early prevention disease . Activities detect woman REMU le 0.9 : Check every day Institute National Perinatology urogynecology service , clinical record woman attend consultation order verify inclusion exclusion criterion . Interviewing woman corroborate inclusion exclusion criterion . Quantify concentration metabolites estrogen urine detect presence REMU le 0.9 . Provide result invite woman present REMU le 0.9 participate project supplementation DIM . When woman REMU equal great 0.9 , provide result dietary guidance focus maintain BMI normal range ( 19.0-24.9 ) decrease ( BMI equal 25 ) weight increase consumption fruit vegetable . Activities woman inclusion study DIM supplementation : Once explain study patient , woman meet criteria inclusion cite provide inform consent letter mention freedom clarify doubt might arise . Once woman read letter , understand agree participate , sign request . On date woman sign letter , another appointment schedule day 12 15 menstrual cycle follow assessment : Personal data : Name , date birth , address , phone , marital status occupation . Socioeconomic : With criterion Mexican Association Agencies Market Opinion base 2005 Complete clinical history include : Family history chronic disease include breast cancer , personal history disease use medication , personal risk factor breast cancer , type , frequency duration physical activity . Nutrition : Whereas anthropometric indicator ( weight , height perimeter wrist , waist hip ) , body composition ( % body fat lean mass method displacement air ) diet ( 24-hour recall , frequency consumption cruciferous vegetable last year use supplement ) . The measurement anthropometric indicator make use LOHMAN technique . The information process NUTRIKCAL system standardize food commonly consume Mexico . First morning urine . First morning urine difference less eight hour previous urine . Once urine sample receive , add , conservation , 0.1 g ascorbic acid per 10 mL urine , store -70°C it´s quantification . For analysis metabolite 2OHE1 16αOHE1 , use competitive solid phase enzyme immunoassay method , use commercial kit ESTRAMET™ 2/16 ( Immune Care Corporation , Bethlehem , MI . USA ) , validate manufacturer gas chromatography mass spectrometry . The analysis perform accord manufacturer 's instruction ; briefly : urine sample hydrolyze enzyme beta glucuronidase sulfatase activity . The free urinary metabolite , join monoclonal antibody conjugate alkaline phosphatase . The quantification metabolites 2OHE1 16αOHE1 performed triplicate reproducibility method already report team study . For determination RMEU reference curve , achieve 97 % accuracy . Adherence side effect . In first assessment give woman calendar daily record consumption omission supplement ( active compound placebo ) well series side effect order ass adherence safety supplement . This included side effect already report study DIM I3C . In addition request participant return supplement vial subsequently make count pill leave . Sample size . To estimate sample size consider follow : Two set comparison ( Placebo 75mg DIM ) . According literature hop find difference .48 average RMEU group supplementation relative placebo group . Other study report standard deviation .77 RMEU . Calculated alpha 0.05 power 80 % . Approximately 31 woman require group plus 10 % replace loss follow-up , give approximate total 35 woman per group . Statistical Analysis . The statistical analysis data carry following way : difference baseline characteristic perform use student T test parametric variable normal distribution , U Mann-Whitney normal distribution X2 nonparametric . The change estrogen metabolite RMEU group evaluate use Wilcoxon test comparison effect group , value concentration metabolite estrogen RMEU well difference , carry means test U Mann-Whitney . Masking . A stranger study researcher , receive coded vial contain DIM supplement placebo , record code role keep envelope open end study .</detailed_description>
