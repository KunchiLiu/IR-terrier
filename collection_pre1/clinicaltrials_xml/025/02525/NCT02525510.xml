	<brief_title>Deceased Organ Donor Interventions Protect Kidney Graft Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The number kidney available transplantation U.S. ( ~15,000/yr ) meet demand ( ~80,000/yr ) . This discrepancy likely worsen give increase U.S. prevalence chronic kidney disease compound sizable organ attrition organ enter donation process ( 25-30 % attrition Region 5 ) . Furthermore , worsen renal function donation neurologic determination death ( DNDD ) organ donor ( increasingly important source allograft ) one strong predictor delay graft function ( DGF ) slow graft function ( SGF ) recipient . Both DGF SGF associate decreased long-term organ survival major concern transplant community . The investigator accomplish goal extend exist research infrastructure across several donor service area .
