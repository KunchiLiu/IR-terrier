	<brief_title>Bilateral Laparoscopic Repair Groin Hernias With One Large Self-fixating Mesh ( ProGripTM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . INTRODUCTION Evidence groin hernia repair show significant reduction recurrence rate since introduction mesh repair . Hence current guideline state surgical treatment groin hernia adult mesh use . In laparoscopic groin hernia repair mesh position preperitoneal plane . Two technique commonly use . A transabdominal technique ( TransAbdominal PrePeritoneal - TAPP ) , preperitoneal plane dissect throughout abdomen , closure peritoneum position mesh , preperitoneal technique ( Totally ExtraPeritoneal - TEP ) peritoneum remain intact . Fixation mesh originally perform penetrate fixation , use staple tacker . Alternative fixation glue , self-fixating mesh mesh fixation , propose avoid postoperative pain related penetrating fixation . Several study able show significant difference recurrence rate different mesh fixation technique . In general , sufficient overlap seem important fixation mesh . However , current guideline state tacker suture fixation mesh groin hernia avoid . Concerns often raise large medial hernia ( EHS classification : M3 ) medial overlap mesh beyond hernia defect small . An overlap less 2-3 cm may lead protrusion mesh hernia opening , risk increase large direct hernia . In general , large hernia opening , overlap . Observational study show high recurrence rate repair direct ( i.e . medial ) hernia . In recent consensus statement , Poelman et al . state diverse type inguinal hernia ( direct vs. indirect , large vs. small ) distinguish treat different way . Despite fact randomize trial differentiate large small hernia , state use heavy weight mesh , mesh fixation large mesh size consider case large medial hernia . In repair bilateral inguinal hernia , current guideline state laparoscopic treatment preferable approach , without clear advantage TEP TAPP vice-versa . During transabdominal ( TAPP ) repair , evaluation subsequent treatment contralateral hernia perform without additional incision and/or trocar placement . Whether one large mesh two separate mesh sufficient overlap use , remain unclear . The IEHS guideline state option use . However , recurrence detect use two separate mesh suggest presence weak zone midline , despite overlap . On hand , application one large mesh seem technically difficult . In laparoscopic groin hernia repair , mesh place anatomical space pubic bone bladder . Any type mesh might therefore potentially influence urinary bladder function . Until clear urinary symptom different patient one large mesh compare two overlap mesh . 2 . AIM AND DESIGN OF THE STUDY Purpose study assessment urinary symptom bilateral repair use one large self-fixating mesh cover groin repair bilateral inguinal hernia . Health outcome assess use different questionaires focus urinary symptom ( ICIQ-MLUTS score ) , recurrence rate , postoperative pain measurement , Quality Life assessment EuraHS-QoL chronic pain monitor 12 month . A total 100 male patient enter trial AZ MARIA MIDDELARES , inclusion period 24 month anticipate . Study inclusion base clinical examination and/or ultrasonography . Informed Consent obtain pre-operatively . 3 . OPERATIVE STANDARD PROCEDURES A bilateral laparoscopic groin hernia repair perform , use one large self-fixating mesh ( ProGripTM ) . transabdominal ( TAPP ) approach totally extra-peritoneal ( TEP ) approach patient . 4 . FOLLOW-UP After receive informed consent plan surgery , patient get invite standard clinical check-up ( 1 month en 12 month post-operatively ) assessment urinary symptom use ICIQ-MLUTS ( International Consultation Incontinence modular Questionnaire Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms ) 1 month , 3 month en 12 month post-operatively . Recurrence rate base clinical examination surgeon follow-up . In case uncertainty clinical evaluation investigation use ultrasonography and/or CT scan perform . Quality Life , use pre- postoperative EuraHS-QoL score postoperative pain use VAS ( Visual Analogue Scale ) scale assess clinical follow-up moment . Additional registration pain medication use perform . 5 . DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS All data related surgical procedure , patient comorbidities post-operative course document prospectively . Anonymized data patient collect online platform EuraHS ( European Registry Abdominal Wall Hernias ) , develop scientific work European Hernia Society EHS specific study account . A study specific CRF include ICIQ-MLUTS , EuraHS-QoL , VAS ( visual analog scale ) VRS ( verbal rating scale provide trial secretariat gather study coordinator .</detailed_description>
