	<detailed_description>A Phase II , Open-Label Safety Efficacy Study Autologous Neo-Kidney Augment ( NKA ) Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Chronic Kidney Disease ( RMTX-CL001 ) . This Multi-center , prospective , open-label , single-group study . NKA make expand autologous select renal cell ( SRC ) obtain patient 's kidney biopsy . To manufacture NKA , kidney biopsy tissue enrol patient sent RegenMedTX , LLC , renal cell expand SRC select . SRC formulate gelatin base hydrogel concentration 100 x 106 cells/mL , package 10 mL syringe , ship clinical site use . All enrolled subject treat two injection NKA least 6 month apart . Up 30 subject undergoing NKA injection enrol study . Patients receive single injection NKA previous research protocol may enroll clinical trial receive single additional implantation . Patients never receive NKA injection may enroll clinical trial total two ( 2 ) NKA injection , temporally space least 6 month apart . All biopsy take single kidney , NKA injection give kidney biopsied . Patients complete screen procedure satisfy I/E criterion enrol study immediately prior injection . Patients meet criterion injection consider screen failure . Once patient inject , patient complete treatment every effort make ensure patient completes follow-up visit . Injection date first 3 patient receive second NKA injection stagger minimum 3 week interval allow assessment acute adverse event safety parameter Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) . At completion follow-up visit , patient continue long-term observational follow-up period . Patients follow total 36 month follow last NKA injection protocol , whether first second injection .</detailed_description>

Treatment angiotensin inhibitor ( ACEI ) angiotensin blocker ( ARB ) initiate least 8 week prior enrollment . Treatment must stable 6 week prior implant . Patients intolerant ACEI ARBs may include stable BP within acceptable limit . 8 . Minimum 2 measurement eGFR serum creatinine ( sCr ) least 3 month apart within 12 month Screening , define rate progression CKD . 9 . Willing able refrain use nonsteroidal drug ( NSAIDs ) ( include aspirin ) , clopidogrel , fish oil , dipyridamole , prasugrel , platelet inhibitor 7 day biopsy implant . 10 . Willing able cooperate aspect study . 11 . Willing able give sign informed consent . 1 . Type 1 diabetes mellitus ( DM ) . 2 . History renal transplant . 3 . HbA1c &gt; 10 % Screening . 4 . Hemoglobin level &lt; 9 g/dL prior implant . 5 . Known allergy kanamycin structurally similar aminoglycoside antibiotic . 6 . Abnormal coagulation status measure partial thromboplastin time ( APTT ) , international normalize ratio ( INR ) , and/or platelet count Screening . 7 . Not good candidate implantation procedure ( base assessment investigator operator ) include patient morbidly obese , BMI &gt; 45 , excessive fat surround kidney , otherwise risk serious complication . 8 . Clinically significant infection require parenteral antibiotic within 6 week implantation . 9 . Patients small kidney ( average size &lt; 9 cm ) one kidney , assess MRI renal US within 1 year screening . 10 . Patients acute kidney injury rapid decline renal function within 3 month prior implantation . 11 . Patients renal tumor , polycystic kidney disease , renal cyst anatomic abnormality would interfere implantation procedure ( e.g. , cysts pathway injection implantation ) , hydronephrosis , skin infection propose implantation site , evidence urinary tract infection . 12 . Female subject pregnant , lactate ( breast feed ) plan pregnancy course study , child bear potential use highly effective method birth control ( include sexual abstinence ) . Subjects must willing continue birth control method throughout course study . 13 . History cancer within past 3 year ( exclude nonmelanoma skin cancer carcinoma situ cervix ) . 14 .
