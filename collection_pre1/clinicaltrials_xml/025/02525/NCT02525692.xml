	<criteria>Histologically confirm World Health Organization Grade IV glioblastoma . Unequivocal evidence progressive disease contrastenhanced brain computerized tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) define Response Assessment NeuroOncology Criteria ( RANO ) , document recurrent glioblastoma diagnostic biopsy . Previous first line therapy least radiotherapy temozolomide . For Arm A : Any number recurrence allowable . For Arm B : First recurrence ( ) glioblastoma complete tumor resection first diagnosis . For Arm C : Patients must clinical and/or radiographic evidence first recurrence glioblastoma ( ) eligible salvage surgical resection deem site Investigator . Must 12 week radiotherapy . If patient within 12 week radiotherapy , progressive lesion must outside highdose radiation target volume unequivocal evidence progressive tumor biopsy specimen . From project start schedule study treatment , follow time period must elapse : 5 halflives investigational agent , 4 week cytotoxic therapy ( except 23 day temozolomide 6 week nitrosoureas ) , 6 week antibody , 4 week ( 5 halflives , whichever short ) antitumor therapy . All adverse event Grade &gt; 1 relate prior therapy ( chemotherapy , radiotherapy , and/or surgery ) must resolve , except alopecia . Male Female age ≥18 year . Karnofsky Performance Status ( KPS ) ≥ 60 % ( see Appendix A ) . Adequate organ marrow function define , screen lab perform within 14 day treatment initiation : leukocytes ≥ 3,000/mcL absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL platelet ≥ 100,000/mcL hemoglobin &gt; 8.0 mg/dL total bilirubin &lt; 2.0 x upper limit normal AST ( SGOT ) /ALT ( SGPT ) ≤2.5 × upper limit normal creatinine OR creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2 patient creatinine level normal . CT MRI within 14 day prior start study drug . Corticosteroid dose must stable decrease least 5 day prior scan . For Arm B : Corticosteroid dose must stable decrease least 2 week prior study entry . The effect ONC201 develop human fetus unknown . For reason , woman childbearing potential men must agree use adequate contraception ( hormonal barrier method birth control ; abstinence ) prior study entry duration study participation . Should woman become pregnant suspect pregnant partner participate study , inform treat physician immediately . Male subject agree use adequate method contraception start first dose study therapy 120 day last dose therapy . Archival tissue evaluation correlative objective ( available ) . Archival tissue require Arms B C. Ability understand willingness sign write informed consent document . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition ONC201 excipients . Current plan participation study investigational agent use investigational device . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited , ongoing active infection psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . Active infection require systemic therapy . Prior stereotactic radiotherapy , convection enhance delivery ( CED ) brachytherapy must biopsy confirm radiographic progression consistent progressive tumor treatmentrelated necrosis . If recurrent lesion outside prior highdose radiation target volume distant prior CED brachytherapy site , subject consider eligible Pregnant woman ONC201 novel agent unknown potential teratogenic abortifacient effect . Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother ONC201 , breastfeed discontinue mother treated ONC201 . Known HIVpositive test combination antiretroviral therapy . Known history cardiac arrhythmia include atrial fibrillation , tachyarrhythmias bradycardia . Receiving therapeutic agent know prolong QT interval exclude . History CHF , MI stroke last 3 month exclude . Active illicit drug use diagnosis alcoholism . Prior bevacizumab treatment glioblastoma . The rationale restrict enrollment patient prior bevacizumab therapy data regard efficacy therapy progression bevacizumab therapy lacking . Tumors isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 ( IDH1 ) IDH2 mutation determine immunohistochemistry IDH1 R132H variant direct sequencing . IDH1/2mutant gliomas markedly longer overall survival rate compare IDH1/2wildtype glioma ( Parsons et al. , 2008 ; Yan et al. , 2009 ) , indicate IDH1/2mutant glioma distinct natural history . Known additional malignancy progress require active treatment within 3 year start study drug . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin , squamous cell carcinoma skin , situ cervical cancer undergone potentially curative therapy . Any surgery ( include minor diagnostic procedure lymph node biopsy ) within 2 week baseline disease assessment ; fully recover side effect previous procedure . Concomitant use CYP3A4/5 inhibitor treatment phase study within 72 hour prior start study drug administration . Concomitant use potent CYP3A4/5 inducer , include enzyme induce antiepileptic drug ( EIAEDs ) ( see Appendix B ) , treatment phase study within 2 week prior start treatment .</criteria>
