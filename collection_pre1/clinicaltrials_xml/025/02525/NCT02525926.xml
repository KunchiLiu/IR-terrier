	<brief_summary>Pulmonary hypertension rare condition lead right ventricular dysfunction premature death . Only modest improvement outcomes observe current available advanced specific drug therapy . Pulmonary hypertension advance therapy also expensive lead frequent adverse effect , sometimes serious . Results pilot study , first-in-man experience pulmonary artery denervation , demonstrate clinical improvement 13 patient severe pulmonary hypertension despite optimal medical management . However single non-randomized study require confirmation . The investigator propose prospective multi-center , randomize , single-blinded trial . Its main objective ass , patient uncontrolled pulmonary hypertension despite optimal medical management , efficacy pulmonary artery denervation reduce mean pulmonary artery pressure ( mPAP ) six month , compare continue medical treatment follow simulate ( sham ) procedure . The principal evaluation criterion mPAP change ( mm Hg ) measure right heart catheterization . The study run 18 month necessary recruit 50 patient . All adult patient ( exception pregnant woman individual unable receive appropriate information give free inform consent ) uncontrolled pulmonary arterial hypertension despite optimal medical management invite participate , absence exclusion criterion . The investigator also measure change clinical , biological , echocardiographic hemodynamic prognostic marker group .</brief_summary>
