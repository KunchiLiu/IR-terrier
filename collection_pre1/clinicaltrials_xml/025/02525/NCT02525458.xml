	<detailed_description>There increase demand orthodontic care worldwide . In United States , approximately one-fifth adolescent teenager , 1 % young adult receive form orthodontic treatment . One major challenge orthodontic treatment long-term stability ; removable fixed retainer require stabilise align dentition prevent post-treatment relapse . Most removable retainer construct polymethyl methacrylates ( PMMA ) , hold metal clasp around posterior teeth . Because removable retainer wear moist intraoral environment fluctuate pH least one year , bacteria fungi may accumulate within retainer form multi-species plaque biofilms act reservoirs microorganism . This may result increase incidence proximal dental caries oral candidiasis . Moreover , opportunistic pathogen methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus identify orthodontic retainer , may potentially lead local systemic infection , particularly orthodontic patient complicate medical disorder . For adult patient , oral microorganism derive removable acrylic appliance implicate bacteria endocarditis , pneumonia , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease gastrointestinal infection . Production volatile odoriferous compound colonize microorganism also contribute halitosis , affect person 's communication psychological well-being . Microbial plaque biofilm accumulation removable orthodontic appliance retainer usually control mechanical chemical mean . Despite effectiveness , procedure demand stringent patient compliance , may readily achievable restricted dexterity . Hence , incorporation antimicrobial activity orthodontic acrylic resin achieve plaque biofilm reduction highly desirable . Conventional PMMA-based antimicrobial approach base leach antimicrobial agent small molecular mass ( e.g . chlorhexidine ) intraoral environment , application antimicrobial coat surface material incorporation antibacterial silver nanoparticles PMMA resin . Antimicrobial polymer rapidly become new class biomaterials functionalized tethered material kill microbe without release biocides . For methacrylates , anionic phosphated PMMA polymer create copolymerize PMMA create acrylic resins permanent , non-leaching antimicrobial property . Cationic polymer contain quaternary ammonium phosphonium group possess contact-killing antimicrobial activity . An antimicrobial antifungal cationic quaternary ammonium methacryloxy silicate molecule ( QAMS ) synthesize sol-gel reaction tetraalkoxysilane two trialkoxysilanes . Containing methacryloxy functional group long C-18 carbon chain , QAMS molecule soluble MMA monomer incorporate PMMA orthodontic acrylic resin . The QAMS-copolymerised acrylic resin demonstrate improved fracture toughness without adversely affect flexural modulus strength orthodontic acrylic . In previous vitro study , orthodontic acrylic resins contain 4-6 % QAMS find possess vitro immediate diffusional well contact-killing antimicrobial property test Streptococcus mutans , Actinomyces naeslundii Candida albicans . To investigate antimicrobial durability QAMS-containing acrylic resin , specimen age water 3 month prior evaluation antimicrobial activity . Even 3 month water-ageing wherein residual effect diffusional kill would completely eliminate , QAMS-containing orthodontic acrylic resin still possess antimicrobial activity single-species biofilms generate three microbe . Antimicrobial polymer design biomedical application also minimally cytotoxic host tissue . In previous study , viability odontoblast-like cell line derive mouse dental papilla examine expose cell QAMS-containing orthodontic acrylic resin . Results cell viability assay indicate QAMS-containing orthodontic acrylic resin relatively non-cytotoxic . The QAMS-containing orthodontic acrylic receive 510 ( K ) clearance market U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) . Nevertheless , clinical trial lack demonstrate vivo antimicrobial potential QAMS-containing orthodontic acrylic multi-species biofilms . Although various multi-species oral biofilm model develop contribute understanding intraoral microbial adhesion biofilm formation , model drawback unlikely replicate variability vivo dynamic plaque biofilms . Apart differences structural characteristic vitro vivo biofilms , presence host defenses antimicrobial peptide derive saliva , seldom take account vitro multi-species biofilm model . More 600 microbial specie identify human oral microflora , approximately 280 specie isolated culture . Thus , plaque biofilm profile unique among individual , modulate different environmental factor well variable quorum sense signal derive adjacent microorganism . These confound factor may temper efficacy antimicrobial polymer vivo . Accordingly , objective present randomise clinical trial determine vivo antimicrobial efficacy FDA-approved QAMS-containing orthodontic acrylic use custom-made removable Hawley retainer wear intraorally recruit subject create 48-hour multi-species plaque biofilms . Because anticipated high variability microbial composition individual plaque biofilms , split-mouth design utilised reduce inter-subject variability , procedures take minimize unwanted carry-across effect . The null hypothesis test difference antimicrobial activity QAMS-free QAMS-containing orthodontic acrylic resin oral biofilms grow vivo human subject .</detailed_description>
