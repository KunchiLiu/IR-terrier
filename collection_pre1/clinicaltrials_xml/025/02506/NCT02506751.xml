	<brief_title>A Phase 1b , Open-label Study Liothyronine MS</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple sclerosis ( MS ) chronic , immune-mediated disease central nervous system ( CNS ) characterize inflammation , demyelination , neurodegeneration . It remain common non-traumatic cause neurologic disability young adult present patient relapsing-remitting disease . Relapses , cause inflammatory demyelination , result significant amount neurological disability reduce health-related quality life , frequent early relapse associate increased risk longer-term disability . Clinical recovery early relapse incomplete approximately half patient MS . The mechanisms underlying relapse recovery completely understood . Remyelination acutely denude axon one mechanism relapse recovery may occur . Remyelination suspect occur via newly differentiate oligodendrocyte , derive oligodendrocyte precursor cell ( OPCs ) CNS . However , despite presence innate repair mechanism , many patient go develop progressive functional disability . This may due failure remyelination progressive axonal injury . Chronic demyelinate lesion surround OPCs premyelinating oligodendrocyte , suggest fail remyelination occur could partially due incomplete oligodendrocyte differentiation . Additionally , recent study highlight importance mitochondrial dysfunction , perhaps relate oxidative stress increase energy demand , mediate MS disease progression . Mitochondrial dysfunction may drive axonal degeneration resultant neurodegeneration progressive neurological decline ( progressive MS ) . While numerous immune modulate therapy exist , currently , urgent need novel therapy neuroreparative neuroprotective property . Thyroid hormone may play direct role remyelination repair adult CNS promote maturation oligodendrocyte . Further , thyroid hormone show reduce oxidative stress thus may capacity prevent mitochondrial dysfunction well . Since tri-iodothyronine ( T3 ) believe mediate important thyroid hormone action , liothyronine ( synthetic form T3 ) potential induce reparative mechanism limit secondary neurodegeneration MS . In mouse , T3 administration show help facilitate recovery cuprizone-induced demyelination . In study , investigator propose perform phase 1 study patient MS establish tolerable dose liothyronine , evaluate safety medication , determine whether impact function , evaluate associate change neurotrophic and/or inflammatory biomarkers cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) .</detailed_description>
