	<detailed_description>In insulin-treated type 2 diabetes relationship endogenous insulin level glucose variability hypoglycaemia risk unclear . An association endogenous insulin level hypoglycaemia risk report United Kingdom Hypoglycaemia Study , low endogenous insulin level increase post-meal glucose rise ( measure glucose variability therefore hypoglycaemia risk ) . However , another large cross-sectional study correlation endogenous insulin level questionnaire-assessed hypoglycaemia risk . C-peptide potential biomarker predict treatment response combination therapy type 2 diabetes Other glucose-lowering therapy may combine insulin type 2 diabetes , combine therapy condition may achieve good blood glucose control insulin alone . In contrast non-insulin therapy usually ineffective type 1 diabetes , likely due difference endogenous insulin secretion . Among commonly use glucose-lowering treatment license combined therapy insulin type 2 diabetes dipeptide peptidase 4 ( DPPIV ) inhibitor . They multiple mechanisms action include potentiation beta cell insulin secretion suppression glucagon . The relative importance mechanism treatment response unclear . Recent work investigator group identify preserve endogenous insulin secretion important glucose-lowering effect related class glucose lower therapy call GLP-1 receptor agonist , little response see severe endogenous insulin deficiency . The investigator hypothesise potentiation endogenous insulin secretion may major mechanism glucose lower DPPIV inhibitor therefore type 2 diabetes , low residual insulin secretion , little change glucose medication . The pharmacodynamics agent ( &gt; 90 % inhibition target enzyme occur within 45 minute ( vildagliptin ) mark glucose lower effect see within hour would allow u explore idea assess impact residual beta cell function glucose-lowering effect one-off dose DPP IV-inhibitor . Hypotheses : The investigator hypothesize patient clinical characteristic type 2 diabetes severe loss endogenous insulin secretion markedly increase glycaemic variability ( therefore hypoglycaemia risk ) , decrease response non-insulin glucose lower treatment comparison patient similar clinical characteristic preserve endogenous insulin . Aim : To determine whether individual residual beta cell function influence glucose variability , hypoglycaemia , response DPP-IV therapy patient insulin-treated type 2 diabetes Research question : In participant insulin-treated type 2 diabetes : 1 . Does individual residual endogenous insulin secretion influence glucose variability hypoglycaemia risk ? 2 . Does individual residual endogenous insulin secretion influence glycaemic response DPPIV inhibitor therapy ? Study design ( Overview ) : The investigator recruit participant clinical diagnosis type 2 diabetes , currently treat insulin therapy know preserve low endogenous insulin secretion . Participants without severe endogenous insulin deficiency match clinical characteristic . Glucose variability , hypoglycaemic risk , response single dose standard glucose lower treatment assess compare group . This require 3 research visit 2 week period ( one non-fasting , two fasting ) . For response treatment aspect study , glucose response mixed meal assess without one-off dose DPPIV inhibitor vildagliptin , test perform random order . Participants recruitment : The investigator recruit 54 participant . Potential participant identify exist research cohort routine clinical practice endogenous insulin status ( C-peptide blood urine ) previously assess . Where patient identify exist cohort give consent future contact , letter database administrator send provide generic information study . Contact detail interested information pass research team continue recruitment process . Where potential participant identify clinical practice give generic information study clinician interested , permission , contact detail pass member research team contact . The research team responsible recruitment process . Participants identify severe insulin deficiency ( n=27 ) match ( gender , HbA1c ) participant retain insulin secretion ( n=27 ) . Visit one ( baseline , research facility participant 's home ) Participants attend non-fasting . Following write informed consent , blood sample ( approximately 30mls total ) take baseline measurement ( include C-peptide , glucose , HbA1c , creatinine , liver function ) save serum plasma . A urine sample collect stored pregnancy test offer pre-menopausal woman . Baseline data include : height , weight , age , duration diabetes , age diagnosis ethnicity , confirmation treatment regimen . A standard hypoglycaemia questionnaire ( Modified Clarke/Edinburgh Hypoglycaemia questionnaire , incorporate Gold question ) complete participant . The participant 's ability self-monitor blood glucose confirm ( education provide necessary ) . Participants instruct use CGM system , requirement self-monitoring blood glucose . Whilst wear continuous glucose monitor participant request test blood glucose level 4 time spread course day ( subsequent calibration purpose ) record data collection sheet provide . They also ask record detail meal , exercise symptom duration monitoring . The automatic device set 4-6 day continuous glucose monitoring . Visit two ( 4-6 day visit 1 , research facility ) Participants ask attend morning visit omit morning insulin consume anything ( except water ) midnight night . If feel unwell , need treat low blood glucose visit postpone . A small cannula insert enable multiple blood sample take minimum discomfort . A fasting blood test ( approximately 15mls ) perform glucose , c-peptide , glucagon save serum/plasma . Participants ask take normal morning insulin 10 % reduction immediately prior consume 250mls meal replacement drink ( Fortisip ) without DPPIV inhibitor ( Vildagliptin 50mg ) tablet . Blood glucose , c-peptide , glucagon save serum/plasma take 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 , 150 180 minute complete drink ( volume blood time point approximately 15 ml ) . A urine sample collect save 180 minute , CGM device disconnect remove . Participant 's bedside blood glucose measure , light lunch provide together advice study clinician regard insulin adjustment require . Visit three ( 4-14 day visit 2 , research facility ) This visit 2 participant give alternative treatment ( DPPIV inhibitor treatment ) . Participants ask keep glucose-lowering therapy identical visit 2 3 , attend research department similar time day visit 2 take evening insulin prior visit 3 time dose prior visit 2 . Randomisation All participant require undertake mixed meal test with/without standard DPPIV inhibitor . The order mixed meal test visit 2 3 decide use randomisation table ( StatsDirect ) , overseen CRF statistician . The randomisation include order minimize theoretical order bias effect ( e.g . glucose level improve study , participant drop-out affect third visit ) . Participants clinical research staff blind , however statistician blind group randomisation allocation purpose analysis Concomitant Therapies All diabetes relate medication continue unaltered . Participants ask change diabetes treatment duration study . The study team manage diabetes medication duration participant 's involvement study . The General Practitioner ( GP ) secondary care diabetes team manage aspect diabetes care line standard clinical practice . Data Collection Recording All participant assign unique study identifier ( ID ) . All data collect record stored ID number . Data initially record onto study specific data collection form ( DCF ) .

Power Calculation statistical analysis The investigator recruit 54 participant ( 27 group ) . This give u 80 % power detect 0.8 Standard Deviation ( SD ) change mean average glucose excursion ( MAGE ) ( 1.44 moll/L [ 35 ] ) , 18 % absolute difference glucose reduction vildagliptin 5 % level significance without substantial endogenous insulin secretion . The CRF statistician blind group randomisation allocation purpose analysis . The investigator compare MAGE , time spend hypoglycaemia ( hours/day ) , Clarke score without severe insulin deficiency use unpaired T-tests . The investigator compare response DPPIV inhibitor ( incremental area curve glucose mixed meal test vildagliptin - incremental area curve glucose test without vildagliptin ) group use unpaired T test . The investigator assess whether outcome variable normally distribute prior analysis log transform use equivalent non-parametric analysis necessary .
