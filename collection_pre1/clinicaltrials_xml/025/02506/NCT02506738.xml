	<brief_summary>The aim study demonstrate effectiveness telemonitoring functional status vital sign early detect heart failure exacerbation , minimize readmission length hospitalisation . Patients 75 heart failure include hospitalisation due heart failure exacerbation . Patients assign randomly intervention control . The intervention group comprise 47 patient assessed telemonitoring , 40 follow traditional clinical pathway . Patients followed-up 3 month discharge , collect emergency visit readmission due new heart failure exacerbation . Those patient intervention group use commercial telemedicine system : Careline H @ , provide company SALUDNOVA . They system personalize add functional status monitoring capability . Thus , system collect vital sign ( i.e . blood pressure , heart rate , respiratory rate , oxygen saturation , glucose , weight ) ; symptom decompensated heart failure ( i.e . dyspnoea orthopnoea ) ; functional status ( i.e . part Short Physical Performance Battery , SPPB ) brief questionnaire ( i.e . Do medication ? ) every 48 hour . Two staff geriatrician Hospital Universitario de Getafe access , work day , secure dedicated web-portal ass progression patient , evaluate monitor variable self report symptom . They react data , need , make phone call visit patient . Besides , patient could contact geriatrician attend emergency room usually . After completion , analysed result . First , carry descriptive analysis data . Later , analyse effect intervention telemedicine predictive value different measure variable logistic regression .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patient registry carry two different Databases : one include general information patient epidemiological data . The database store monitor data obtain every 48 hour . Quality assurance source data verification achieve retrieve general information patient Hospital Electronic Medical Record . Moreover epidemiological information assess Principal Investigator remove outlier value assess occurrence sharp change temporal series ( e.g . change &gt; 0.5Kg two day ) . Patients recruit acute unit Geriatrics Service . When admit due heart failure exacerbation train nurse perform initial ass . If patient suitable , geriatrician explain /her study patient accept asked sign inform consent . Then assign randomly group . For intervention group , train geriatrician nurse perform measurement mobile phone . For control group , staff record baseline characteristic , follow-up emergency visit , readmission death record . These latter variable also record patient intervention group . The data dictionary include variable identify patient others describe status evolution : - Oxygen saturation , measure integer ( 80-100 ) - Heart rate , measure beats/minute ( 0-200 ) - Diastolic blood , measure mmHg ( 0-100 ) - Systolic blood pressure , measure mmHg ( 0-100 ) - Respiratory rate , measure breaths/minute ( 0-100 ) - Skin temperature , measure Celsius - Weight , measure kg - Glucose , measure mg/dl ( 0-500 ) - Short Physical Performance Battery , time walk 4.3 meter , measure second ( 0-100 ) - Short Physical Performance Battery , gait speed 4.3 meter , measure decimal meters/second ( 0-1 ) - Short Physical Performance Battery , chair stand test , measure second ( 0-100 ) - Symptom question Q1 : Do feel worse last time ? , measure Boolean variable ( YES/NO ) - Symptom question Q2 : Do feel bad day hospital discharge ? , measure Boolean variable ( YES/NO ) - Symptom question Q3 : Do feel shorten breath ? , measure categorical variable ( effort/DLA/at rest ) - Symptom question Q4 : Do feel legs swell ? ? , measure Boolean variable ( YES/NO ) - Symptom question Q5 : Have wake night feel fatigue ? ? , measure Boolean variable ( YES/NO ) - Symptom question Q6 : Have need pillow sleep last time ? ? , measure Boolean variable ( YES/NO ) - Symptom question Q7 : Have take drug ? ? , measure Boolean variable ( YES/NO ) - Symptom question Q8 : Have follow food drink indication physician ? , measure Boolean variable ( YES/NO ) Sample size calculate reduce readmission rate 10 % 3 month time . Having significant level 0.05 . Sample : 50-60 per group . With first 20 patient include , sample size recalculate , 40 need group . However , include patient intervention ( 50 ) face drop , 3 drop study , obtain data 47 intervention group . Missing data exclude analysis , registry exclude . If patient register one measurement expect data , late remain , rest delete . Statistical analysis : First , carry descriptive analysis data . Later , analyse effect intervention telemedicine predictive value different measure variable logistic regression . Descriptive data present median value ( IQR ) . Baseline characteristic control intervention group compare use non-parametric test ( Mann-Whitney ) . In order determine effect intervention , analysis divide two part . First , logistic regression model fit determine patient monitorization ( yes/no ) significantly predict worsen use age sex covariates . Then , new variable , hospitalization length stay , create length stay readmission group ass whether use telemonitoring affected length hospitalisation . Both control intervention group compare use Mann-Whitney . Finally , intervention group , logistic regression model fit determine factor significantly predict worsen . All analysis make Statistical Package R window ( Vienna , Austria ) ( http : //www.r-project.org ) , version 3.1.1 . P-value set level &lt; 0.05 .</detailed_description>
