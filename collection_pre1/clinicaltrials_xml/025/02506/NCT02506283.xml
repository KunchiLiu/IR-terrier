	<brief_summary>This study investigate effect cool recovery performance characteristic young healthy subject . The study divide two project : Project A : investigates effect 20 min . post-exercise cool vertical jump performance delay onset muscle soreness rat perceived exertion . Project B : investigates effect 20 min . pre-exercise cool maximal voluntary contraction right M. quadriceps femoris delay onset muscle soreness rat perceived exertion .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effect Thermotherapy Recovery Performance</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The aim study investigate effect 20 min . external cooling application ( +8°C ) versus external thermo neutral application ( +32°C ) 72 hour post application . The study divide two project : Project A : This study focus recovery process max . jump performance ( 3x30 counter movement jump ) . Directly exercise subject receive cool thermo-neutral application . Recovery characteristic measure vertical jump performance ( objective ) delay onset muscle soreness rat perceived exertion ( subjective ) measure function time 72 hour post cool intervention . Project B : This study focus effect 20 min . cool thermo-neutral application M. quadriceps femoris performance ( MVC ) . After thermo-application , 60 % endurance MVC measure mean surface EMG ( OT Bioelettronica 10-750 Hz ) ergometer chair 90° degree knee flexion ( Cor 1 Bioelettronica ) . Muscle conduction velocity , MVC ( objective ) , delay onset muscle soreness rat perceived exertion ( subjective ) measure function time 72 hour post thermo-application .</detailed_description>
