	<brief_summary>Chronic sinusitis disease involve severe swell facial sinus nasal cavity . Chronic sinusitis common disorder roughly 5 % adult men woman chronic sinusitis Canada . Surgery show benefit people suffer chronic sinusitis . There two surgery show help people : 1 ) Endoscopic sinus surgery septoplasty 2 ) Septoplasty alone . Both surgery research show help improve quality life reduce symptom . However , unknown surgery well . 'Endoscopic sinus surgery Septoplasty ' us special telescope nostril make nasal septum straight open facial sinus without incision . The sinus open use special microscopic instrument procedure take approximately 90-120 minute . 'Septoplasty alone ' shorter ( take approximately 25-30 minute ) less invasive ( open facial sinus ) might provide benefit compare large longer endoscopic sinus surgery . Currently , perform 'Endoscopic Sinus Surgery Septoplasty ' together standard care , however , limited evidence support perform 'Septoplasty alone ' provide similar result shorter low risk . This represent significant gap investigator ' knowledge , adversely impact doctor 's ability counsel patient chronic sinusitis elect undergo surgery . The purpose study understand surgery ( endoscopic sinus surgery plus septoplasty OR septoplasty alone ) appropriate people chronic sinusitis . You ask participate study chronic sinusitis also go surgery improve quality life .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Chronic sinusitis , officially know chronic rhinosinusitis ( CRS ) , common yet under-recognized chronic inflammatory disease paranasal sinuses affect approximately 5 % Canadian population . Aside gain reputation detrimental effect patient quality-of-life ( QoL ) daily productivity , CRS associate lifetime medical surgical resource consumption result significant health care expenditure . The estimate direct cost CRS Canadian health care system $ 990 million per year , comparable annual direct cost asthma . The large economic burden chronic sinusitis provide strong incentive improve quality value care chronic inflammatory disease . Although etiology CRS consider multi-factorial without one single unify factor , several study investigate role septal deviation predispose factor CRS . A systematic review meta-analysis quantify outcome conclude statistical evidence association CRS septal deviation , especially septal deviation angle &gt; 10-degrees . However , clinical relevance septal deviation etiologic factor CRS still unknown . Based several recent evidence-based guideline , sinonasal 'surgery ' consider patient medically refractory CRS define persistent symptom despite minimum 3 month topical sinonasal corticosteroid therapy along minimum 7-day course systemic corticosteroid +/- 2-week course broad-spectrum antibiotic . The important question remain , appropriate surgical intervention patient refractory CRS ? Currently two surgical option CRS procedures non-randomized evidence support beneficial effect patient population : ( 1 ) Septoplasty alone ( ie . correct deviated septum dissect paranasal sinus ) , ( 2 ) Endoscopic sinus surgery ( ESS ) along septoplasty ( ie . correct septal deviation open paranasal sinus ) . With estimate direct health care cost exceed $ 100 million spent sinonasal surgery Canada management CRS , optimize allocation scarce surgical resource toward intervention proven benefit would result significant improvement quality value care patient . In 2005 , prospective non-randomized study compare septoplasty alone septoplasty plus ESS . They demonstrate septoplasty alone 93 % subjective success rate patient CRS different 88 % success rate ESS plus septoplasty . Although study provide insight topic , limited lack randomization , lack stringent inclusion criterion refractory CRS , lack use validated patient-reported outcome measure . Since 2004 , several prospective observational cohort study evaluate role ESS patient refractory CRS . Overall outcomes study suggest ESS provide improved patient-reported outcome objective outcome . However , despite excellent observational evidence support septoplasty ESS , never robust randomize control trial ( RCT ) prove additional benefit ESS compare septoplasty alone patient CRS . In real world practice , ESS commonly perform combination septoplasty despite lack RCT . The lack level-1 evidence continue raise question regard true effectiveness appropriateness ESS patient CRS oppose perform septoplasty alone . This current gap literature provide strong incentive evaluate role ESS use RCT design impetus behind research project .</detailed_description>
