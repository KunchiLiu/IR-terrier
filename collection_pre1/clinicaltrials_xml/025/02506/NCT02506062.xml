	<brief_title>A Trial Ischemic Preconditioning Raynaud 's Phenomenon ( RP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Raynaud 's phenomenon ( RP ) define vasospasms artery cause pallor least one color change upon reperfusion cyanosis redness . The current treatment RP ( channel blocker , PDE5 inhibitor , etc . ) modest efficacy associate many side-effects include headache , flush , hypotension fluid retention require stop medication . Thus , identification innovative treatment important therapeutic goal RP patient . Ischemic precondition simple non-invasive procedure consist 4 consecutive episode brief ischemia cause place pneumatic cuff level brachial artery inflate 200 mm Hg 2.5 minute , follow 2.5 minute reperfusion . Over 20 year IPC generate tremendous scientific interest describe powerful available form vivo protection ischemic injury . This clinical trial measure efficiency RIPC decreasing frequency , duration severity RP attack . 24 patient recruited Rheumatology clinic St. Joseph 's Health Care London , Ontario . As enter trial , subject assign treatment placebo group accord pre-set randomization schedule . The trial single-blinded ( patient ) . The primary outcome measure ( frequency , duration severity ) assess patient daily basis use journal provide investigator . Secondary outcome measure include function questionnaire ( Raynaud 's Condition Score , s-HAQ-DI , DASH ) biological marker endothelial damage ( P-selectin , I-CAM , VEGF ) , conduct every two week : baseline , post-placebo , post-washout , post-treatment phase . Patients participation span 8 week . The first two week baseline measurement status RP use journal , questionnaire , serum test . The treatment period last 6 week subject complete arm IPC regimen he/she assign . Other result may arise trial : - The tolerance RIPC rheumatology patient , monitor side-effects . - The attitude rheumatology patient use non-pharmacological treatment , questionnaire . - Elucidating part RP mechanism , measure bio-markers - Differences primary secondary RP , stratify randomization The result analyze three primary outcome measure difference baseline treatment . These difference compare treatment placebo stratify primary vs. secondary possibly demographic data . This trial , positive , offer another treatment RP patient . This option possibly few side-effects well accepted common safe non-pharmacological intervention .</detailed_description>
