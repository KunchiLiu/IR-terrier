	<detailed_description>Meropenem important management post-neurosurgical meningitis , data penetration across blood-brain barrier ( BBB ) inadequate . This prospective , open-label study investigate pharmacokinetic profile meropenem patient post-neurosurgical central nervous system ( CNS ) infection , especially BBB penetration cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) . A total 82 patient post-neurosurgical CNS infection include receive meropenem intravenously accord regimen 2g q8h , 1g q8h 1g q6h . After infusion 4 dos , blood CSF sample collect simultaneously predefined timepoints . High-performance liquid chromatography ultraviolet method use determine concentration meropenem .</detailed_description>
