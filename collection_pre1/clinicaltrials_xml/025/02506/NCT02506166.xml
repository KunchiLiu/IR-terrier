	<detailed_description>Detailed Study Description Purpose : There strong evidence patient ischemic cardiomyopathy high cardiovascular mortality , include high risk sudden cardiac death . Sleep apnea frequently present patient myocardial infarction/with ischemic cardiomyopathy ( approximately 50 % patient ) . Both central obstructive sleep apnea consider independent risk factor worsen prognosis patient heart failure reduce ejection fraction ( HFrEF ) . However , evidence randomize trial yet provide evidence sleep apnea independent risk factor lead increase cardiovascular mortality , include increase risk sudden cardiac arrhythmic death patient ischemic cardiomyopathy . There also data randomize trial assess treatment sleep apnea positive airway pressure therapy may improve cardiovascular outcome patient , include reduce risk sudden cardiac death . Rationale : ICD therapy decrease risk sudden cardiac death patient HFrEF , include patient ICM leave ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 35 % . Current ESC Guidelines implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( ICD ) therapy primary prevention sudden cardiac death patient ischemic cardiomyopathy high sensitivity high positive predictive value . A limitation current guideline low specificity low negative predictive value . In real clinical practice , mean less 1/3 patient heart failure reduce ejection fraction get ICD device indication primary prevention sudden cardiac death receive appropriate ICD discharge . The remain 2/3 patient benefit ICD implantation , expose risk complication result ICD implant , inappropriate ICD discharge , lead dislocation , even life-threatening complication infectious endocarditis myocardial perforation . Therefore , improvement stratification criterion allow good identification patient ICM real benefit ICD therapy , improvement long-term outcome cost-benefit ICD therapy , represent one major challenge modern cardiology . Previous study show sleep apnea increase risk sudden cardiac death population . In word , sleep apnea represent treatable condition also potential risk factor sudden cardiac death . Some previously non-randomized study show patient HFrEF , obstructive central sleep apnea may increase risk sudden cardiac arrhythmic death . Contrary observation , recently release preliminary data SERVE-HF trial indicate patient HFrEF , treatment central sleep apnea adaptive servo-ventilation therapy increase cardiovascular mortality , responsible mechanism might include increase risk sudden cardiac death . There several pathophysiological mechanism obstructive central sleep apnea may increase risk sudden cardiac arrhythmic death ICM patient . Considering high prevalence sleep disorder breathe patient ICM , sleep apnea represent modifiable risk factor , proper treatment may decrease risk sudden cardiac death and/or improve cardiovascular outcome ICM patient . However , randomized study specifically address role sleep apnea risk sudden cardiac arrhythmic death ICM patient need clarify exist controversy provide information highly need routine clinical practice . Objective The ESCAPE - SCD Study address follow specific study question : - Is obstructive sleep apnea and/or central sleep apnea independent risk factor sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) patient ICM indicate ICD/CRT-D implant base current ESC Guidelines primary prevention sudden cardiac death ? - Can treatment predominant ( &gt; 50 % ) obstructive sleep apnea appropriate Positive Airway Pressure ( PAP ) therapy decrease risk sudden cardiac arrhythmic death ICM patient ? - Can treatment predominant ( &gt; 50 % ) obstructive sleep apnea appropriate PAP therapy improve cardiovascular outcome ICM patient indicate ICD/CRT-D implant ? - Does obstructive sleep apnea represent novel factor may improve risk stratification sudden cardiac death advance identification patient benefit ICD/CRT-D therapy ? Study Design : Prospective , randomize , international multi-centric study . Study Population : 900 patient ICM indicate ICD/CRT-D implant base 2012 2013 ESC Guidelines primary prevention sudden cardiac death ( see Section : `` References '' ) enrol study . A sleep study perform subject base result patient divide 4 Groups . â€¢ No Mild Sleep Apnea Group ( Group 1 ) : Patients mild sleep apnea continue standard therapy ( ICD/CRT-D implant + maximal medical therapy ) . Patients moderate severe predominant obstructive sleep apnea ( AHI &gt; 15 ) randomize 1:1 ratio - Obstructive Sleep Apnea - Control Group ( Group 2 ) - patient predominant obstructive sleep apnea receive standard therapy ( ICD/CRT-D implant + maximal medical therapy ) , PAP therapy sleep apnea treatment - Obstructive Sleep Apnea - Active Group ( Group 3 ) - patient predominant obstructive sleep apnea receive standard therapy ( ICD/CRT-D implant + maximal medical therapy ) , plus , intervention , sleep apnea treatment use PAP therapy . - Central Sleep Apnea Group ( Group 4 ) - patient predominant central sleep apnea receive standard therapy ( ICD/CRT-D implant + maximal medical therapy ) . Because SERVE-HF Trial demonstrate negative effect predominantly central sleep apnea treatment cardiovascular mortality patient HFrEF use adaptive servo-ventilation therapy , patient Group 4 receive PAP therapy treatment sleep disorder breathing followed . Distribution Patient Population among Study Group : Based data derive pilot study , approximately 60 % patient ischemic cardiomyopathy indicate ICD/CRT-D implant primary prevention sudden cardiac death undiagnosed moderate severe sleep apnea . Therefore , expect follow distribution patient among patient ' group : Group 1 : n=400 patient ; Group 2 : n=200 patient ; Group 3 : n=200 , Group 4 : n=100 patient . Primary secondary goal : Primary goal : - Assessment sleep apnea treatment risk sudden cardiac arrhythmic death assess number appropriate ICD/CRT-D discharge group Secondary goal : - Assessment effect sleep apnea OSA treatment cardiovascular mortality morbidity assess MACE ( Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events ) - Assessment incidence complication result ICD/CRT-D therapy among study group - Assessment sleep apnea novel factor may improve risk stratification sudden cardiac death advance identification patient benefit ICD/CRT-D therapy . - Assessment sleep apnea treatment systolic diastolic function neurohumoral profile - Assessment prevalence sleep apnea severity among study population Eligibility Ages Eligible Study : 18 Years old Genders Eligible Study : Both Accepts Healthy Volunteers : No Technologies use sleep apnea treatment It plan use Airsense 10 Autoset ( AutoCPAP ) Aircurve 10 CS Pacewave ( AutoASV ) RESMED device sleep disordered breathing treatment Group 3 sleep apnea treatment telemonitoring option . Technologies use detection life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia : Most advanced ICD/CRT-D technology allow telemonitoring detection cardiac arrhythmia use many patient possible enrolled study . Study Timeline : - Study initiation : January 2016 - Patient enrollment : March 2016 - December 2017 - Average follow-up : 36 month - End follow-up : December 2019 - Data analysis : January-December 2021 - Estimated publication final result : 2022 Study Co-Principal Investigators ( list alphabetically ) : Assoc .

The study also address important question related improvement selection patient may benefit ICD/CRT-D therapy . We solid evidence pilot data addition sleep disorder breathe screen treatment may improve selection patient ischemic cardiomyopathy benefit ICD therapy , include improvement long-term outcome . Use technologies telemonitoring efficiency sleep disorder breathe treatment occurrence cardiac arrhythmias increase scientific strength study explore benefit use telemonitoring technology daily clinical practice .</detailed_description>
