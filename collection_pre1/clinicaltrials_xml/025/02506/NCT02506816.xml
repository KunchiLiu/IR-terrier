	<detailed_description>The main objective present proposal study assess biological consequence PARP inhibition type I primary EC , patient receive therapy AZD2281 period time diagnosis surgery . This phase 0 trial `` Exploratory Investigational New Drug '' study , type trial involves limit number patient drug therapy therapeutic diagnostic intent drug exposure limit duration dosage low 100 % dose required yield pharmacologic effect . The purpose phase 0 study assist go versus no-go decision-making process drug 's fate earlier development process , use relevant human model instead rely sometimes inconsistent animal data , thus help confirm endpoint mechanism action , pharmacology , bioavailability pharmacodynamics .</detailed_description>
