	<brief_summary>This randomized phase III trial study well high-dose recombinant interferon alfa-2B ipilimumab work compare pembrolizumab treat patient stage III-IV melanoma remove surgery likely come back spread . High-dose recombinant interferon alfa-2B may help shrink slow growth melanoma . Monoclonal antibody , ipilimumab pembrolizumab , may block tumor growth different way target certain cell . It yet know whether high-dose recombinant interferon alfa-2B ipilimumab effective pembrolizumab treat patient melanoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>High-Dose Recombinant Interferon Alfa-2B , Ipilimumab , Pembrolizumab Treating Patients With Stage III-IV High Risk Melanoma That Has Been Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare overall survival ( OS ) patient resect stage III IV melanoma treat physician/patient choice either high dose interferon alfa-2b ( recombinant interferon alfa-2b ) ipilimumab versus MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) . II . Among patient PD-L1 positive , compare OS patient resect stage III IV melanoma treat physician/patient choice either high dose interferon alfa-2b ipilimumab versus MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) . III . To compare relapse-free survival ( RFS ) patient resect stage III IV melanoma treat physician/patient choice either high dose interferon alfa-2b ipilimumab MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) . IV . Among patient PD-L1 positive , compare RFS patient resect stage III IV melanoma treat physician/patient choice either high dose interferon alfa-2b ipilimumab MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To estimate OS RFS patient PD-L1 negative PD-L1 indeterminate population . II . To compare OS RFS patient two regimen within PD-L1 positive negative subgroup look interaction PD-L1 ( positive versus negative ) treatment arm . III . To assess safety tolerability regimen . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To bank tissue whole blood anticipation future correlative study patient population . II . To evaluate PD-L1 expression immunohistochemistry assay . III . To evaluate effect treatment-related side effect may impact health-related domain quality life ( QOL ) use Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy ( FACT ) -Biological Response Modifiers ( BRM ) , European Quality Life Five Dimension Three Level Scale ( EQ-5D-3L ) , Functional Assessment Chronic Illness Therapy Diarrhea ( FACIT-D ) patient treat physician/patient choice either high-dose interferon alfa-2b ipilimumab MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) . IV . Pharmacokinetic ( PK ) anti-drug antibody ( ADA ) test perform patient receive MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) . These analysis evaluate : exposure-response analysis activity efficacy , potential pharmacodynamic biomarkers , safety MK-3475 ( pembrolizumab ) . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM I : INDUCTION THERAPY : Patients receive high-dose recombinant interferon alfa-2B intravenously ( IV ) 20 minute day 1-5 . Treatment repeat weekly 4 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Or patient receive ipilimumab IV 90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week total 4 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . MAINTENANCE THERAPY : Patients receive high-dose recombinant interferon alfa-2B subcutaneously ( SC ) day 1 , 3 , 5 . Treatment repeat every 6 week 48 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . Or patient receive ipilimumab IV 90 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 12 week 3 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive pembrolizumab IV 30 minute day 1 . Treatment repeat every 3 week 52 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day , 6 12 week , every 3 month 2 year , every 6 month 3 year , every 12 month 5 year .</detailed_description>
