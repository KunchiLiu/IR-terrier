	<brief_summary>Many patient undergo ambulatory shoulder arthroscopy experience moderate severe pain surgery . Finding way minimize postoperative pain ideal . Dexamethasone corticosteroid commonly use prevent and/or treat nausea inflammation . The addition high dose dexamethasone nerve block , injection local anesthetic upper shoulder area , show prolong block duration reduce pain . However , unclear whether advantage longer pain relief outweighs patient dissatisfaction prolong feel numb arm . Furthermore , recent study show systemic , intravenously administer dexamethasone may similarly reduce pain level compare dexamethasone block . In study , investigator propose examine effect low-dose IV versus block dexamethasone interscalene block duration patient undergo shoulder arthroscopy . Most study use 4 mg . One study suggest 1 mg may effect large dos . Our aim determine whether addition low-dose dexamethasone local anesthetic block prolong duration , whether difference postoperative pain , consumption painkiller , side effect , satisfaction patient receive IV block dexamethasone . Patients ( 128 total ) randomly assign either receive IV block dexamethasone , postoperative assessment ( pain , painkiller use , side effect , block duration , satisfaction , complication ) make via phone 2 , 3 , 4 ( need ) , 7-10 day surgery . Results study reveal whether patient prefer longer-duration analgesia may obtain low-dose dexamethasone block .</brief_summary>
