	<brief_title>Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) Alpha iNhibition In Advanced Breast Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The technology exist advance concept personalized medicine cancer patient . The advent next generation sequence allow u potentially characterize individual 's tumor oncogenic driver mutation . It unknown present wide range mutation phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ( PI3K ) pathway predict responsiveness PI3K inhibitor would expect situation `` oncogene addiction '' . In study , plan explore two cohort patient response BYL719 , oral selective PI3K-alpha inhibitor : 1 . Metastatic triple negative breast cancer ( triple negative breast cancer [ TNBC ] define ER-/HER2- ) 2 . PI3K pathway abnormal metastatic luminal breast cancer ( ER+/HER2- ) . Both cohort eligible study progression standard first line therapy . In recent large sequence effort , example The Cancer Genome Atlas [ TCGA ] , primary breast cancer find large number Pi3K pathway abnormalities- TNBC high rate genetic abnormality Pi3K pathway ( combined mutation , amplification deletion nearly 100 % TNBC ) - well ER+/HER2- disease . Therefore , study plan study response BYL719 association genetic feature could signify Pi3K pathway activation cohort fully molecular- characterize metastatic breast cancer order identify biomarkers response selective PI3K alpha inhibition breast cancer .</detailed_description>
