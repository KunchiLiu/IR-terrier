	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study safety well multi-peptide cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) -modified vaccinia Ankara ( MVA ) vaccine work reduce CMV complication patient previously infect CMV undergo donor hematopoietic cell transplant . CMV virus may reproduce cause disease even death patient lower immune system , undergoing hematopoietic cell transplant . By place 3 small piece CMV deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) ( chemical form gene ) safe , weaken virus call MVA , multi-peptide CMV-MVA vaccine may able induce immunity ( ability recognize respond infection ) CMV . This may help reduce CMV complication reduce need antiviral drug patient undergo donor hematopoietic cell transplant .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability CMV-MVA Triplex ( multi-peptide CMV-MVA vaccine ) vaccinate hematopoietic cell transplant ( HCT ) recipients assess follow : non-relapse mortality ( NRM ) 100 day post HCT , severe ( grade 3-4 ) acute graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) ( aGVHD ) , grade 3-4 adverse event ( AEs ) ( Common Terminology Criteria Adverse Events [ CTCAE ] 4.0 ) probably definitely related vaccination within 2 week vaccination . II . To determine CMV-MVA Triplex reduce frequency CMV event define reactivation CMV disease allogeneic CMV positive HCT recipient ( HCT-R+ ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To characterize CMV reactivation CMV disease recipient CMV-MVA Triplex compare placebo assess time-to viremia ( defined number day transplantation date &gt; 500 CMV gc/mL ) , duration viremia , recurrence viremia , incidence late CMV viremia/disease ( &gt; 100 = &lt; 360 day post HCT ) , use antiviral drug ( trigger clinically significant viremia &gt; = 1500 CMV gc/mL ) , cumulative number CMV specific antiviral treatment day . II . To evaluate impact CMV-MVA Triplex transplant relate outcomes assess incidence acute GVHD ( aGVHD ) , chronic GVHD ( cGVHD ) , relapse , non-relapse mortality , all-cause mortality , infection . III . To determine 1 ) CMV-MVA Triplex increase level , function kinetics CMV-specific T cell immunity vaccinate compare placebo treat human leukocyte antigen ( HLA ) A*0201 , CMV seropositive HCT-recipients , 2 ) determine whether vaccination induces adaptive natural killer ( NK ) cell population change , increase highly cytotoxic memory killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily C , member 2 ( NKG2C ) + NK cell , 3 ) explore GVHD biomarkers compare vaccine placebo group . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM I : Patients receive multi-peptide CMV-MVA vaccine intramuscularly ( IM ) day 28 56 post-HCT . ARM II : Patients receive placebo IM day 28 56 post-HCT . After completion study , patient follow 1 year post-HCT .</detailed_description>
