	<brief_summary>The trial open-label , randomize , trial examine novel biomarkers thrombosis patient manage rivaroxaban vs. standard care follow treatment pulmonary embolism ( PE ) catheter-guided alteplase . Patients &gt; 18 year old present PE manage catheter-guided alteplase screen study inclusion . Patient 's meeting inclusion/exclusion criterion undergo inform consent . Immediately follow completion alteplase infusion , patient randomize receipt rivaroxaban 15 mg oral bid 21 day follow 20mg oral daily continuation unfractioned heparin low-molecular weight heparin initiation warfarin adjust INR 2-3 . Blood sample take within 2 hour CDT completion prior receipt study treatment ( study day 1 ) , 8h-12h , 24h , 48h , 5d ( prior hospital discharge ) , 30 day follow-up . Clinical endpoint , include bleeding , evidence thrombosis progression , death track index hospitalization follow-up 30 day post-discharge .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>XENITH : Rivaroxaban Pulmonary Embolism Managed With Catheter Directed Thrombolysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Catheter-guided alteplase grow role management acute pulmonary embolism ( PE ) . Following 12-24 hour alteplase infusion ( bilateral unilateral PE , respectively ) patient routinely manage therapeutic unfractionated heparin ( UFH ) bridge chronic warfarin therapy . It desire study effect rivaroxaban vs. standard care follow catheter-guided alteplase thrombolytic therapy ( CDT ) patient acute pulmonary embolism . Use rivaroxaban may offer several important advantage compare standard therapy setting . Among potential rivaroxaban improve novel biomarkers thrombosis include inhibition neutrophil extracellular trap ( NETs ) , tissue factor-positive microparticles , marker inflammation . Neutrophil release extracellular DNA may provide scaffold upon venous thrombosis propagates . NETs associate thrombus organization . Their dissolution may facilitate thrombolysis . Circulating DNA , surrogate marker NETs , elevate 2-3 fold patient venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) correlate strongly plasma myeloperoxidase ( MPO ) , inflammatory marker neutrophil monocyte activation . The investigator previously demonstrate heparin trigger MPO release leukocytes . Thus , resonable speculate anti-Xa therapy may reduce inflammation , MPO , NET level circulation . Further , investigator observe catheter-directed thrombolysis may increase length stay ( time frame = 8 hour 30 day follow administration study drug ) investigator would also propose treatment rivaroxaban may balance eliminate `` bridge '' period .</detailed_description>
