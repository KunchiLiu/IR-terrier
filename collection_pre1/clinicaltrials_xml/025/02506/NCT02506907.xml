	<detailed_description>The overall aim work ass relationship stroke risk hemodynamic compensation strategy , measure use novel 3.0 Tesla ( T ) MRI protocol , patient symptomatic intracranial ( IC ) steno-occlusive disease . Recent study show high two-year ischemic stroke rate approximately 20 % symptomatic IC stenosis patient . Aggressive therapy IC stenosis patient include revascularization angioplasty , IC stenting , bypass , however identification patient likely benefit aggressive intervention , rather medical management alone , problematic . Accurate measurement hemodynamic compromise likely require good define stroke risk guide treatment decision . Specifically , IC stenosis patient compromise cerebral perfusion pressure ( CPP ) , extent hemodynamic compromise reflect autoregulatory capacity vasculature increase arterial cerebral blood volume ( aCBV ) and/or develop collateral supplement cerebral blood flow ( CBF ) . The prevalence CBF collateralization aCBV autoregulation hypothesize correlate uniquely stroke risk , however extent correlation debate . The critical barrier stratify stroke risk rest lack ( ) methodology measure multiple hemodynamic factor high specificity ( ii ) noninvasive approach capable monitor longitudinal progression impairment . The investigator demonstrate clinical utility relatively new , noninvasive MRI approach assess cerebrovascular reactivity ( CVR ) , aCBV , collateral CBF . These approach optimize feasibility assess healthy volunteer isolate clinical study , however comparatively little information available regard relationship collective measure stroke risk . Therefore , investigator propose complement establish angiographic structural imaging novel , validate hemodynamic measurement ass tissue-level impairment compensation strategy patient IC stenosis . Using collective approach combine measurement collateral CBF , aCBV CVR multiple brain region , conjunction statistical model incorporate parameter possible prognostic factor , investigator quantify extent two-year stroke risk associate hemodynamic compensation mechanism population symptomatic IC stenosis patient . The noninvasive multi-faceted scope investigation intend expand diagnostic stroke infrastructure elucidate new hemodynamic prognostic indicator stroke high-risk population . Hypothesis ( 1 ) . Changes collateral CBF hypercarbic stimulation positively correlate two-year stroke incidence symptomatic IC stenosis patient . Aim ( 1 ) . By separately magnetically label blood water different feeding artery ( 8 ) , investigator use test vessel-selective arterial spin labeling ( VS-ASL ) approach calculate perfusion asymmetry index noninvasively assess change collateral CBF pattern patient IC stenosis . IC stenosis ( n=90 ) patient monitor two year know stroke incidence 20 % . Stroke incidence record separate correlation perfusion asymmetry stroke risk assess . Hypothesis ( 2 ) . Regionally reduced CVR , indicative vascular steal phenomenon , elevate aCBV , positively correlate two-year stroke incidence symptomatic IC stenosis patient . Aim ( 2 ) . CVR , measure use blood oxygenation level-dependent ( BOLD ) MRI signal change response hypercarbia , use assess cerebrovascular reserve . The inflow vascular-space-occupancy dynamic subtraction ( iVASO-DS ) approach , develop demonstrated patient , apply assess baseline aCBV . For patient Aim 1 , CVR dynamic aCBV statistically assess unique relationship two-year stroke incidence . Hypothesis ( 3 ) . Collateral CBF , autoregulatory aCBV , CVR correlate unequally two-year stroke incidence , extent quantify use multi-component prediction model . Aim ( 3 ) . The investigator build statistical prediction model , use collateral CBF , aCBV CVR prognostic factor , quantify extent trend parameter collectively contribute stroke risk . The high two-year stroke rate ( 20 % ) large number admit patient symptomatic IC stenosis , enable study detect hypothesize group difference high statistical power . This work extension recent methodological work whereby novel , collective compensatory hemodynamic protocol apply specific clinical population understand prognostic potential . Successful completion provide new information tissue hemodynamics stroke risk patient use guide management decision , ultimately reduce stroke incidence high-risk population .</detailed_description>
