	<brief_summary>Phantom limb pain ( PLP ) frequent consequence amputation , notoriously difficult treat . Amputation usually follow traumatic injury surgery follow vascular disease , diabetes , osteomyelitis tumour case loss limb require survival patient . The loss limb body part usually follow sensation lose body part still present felt . These phenomenon call , respectively , phantom awareness phantom sensation . In 50-80 % amputee neuropathic pain develop lose limb also refer phantom limb pain ( PLP ) . PLP relate certain position movement phantom limb , might elicit worsened range physical factor ( e.g . change weather pressure residual limb ) psychological factor ( e.g . emotional stress ) . It well known treatment available PLP today , pharmacological , surgical , anaesthetic , psychological , ineffective . Today believe phantom limb pain may relate change cortex brain . There evidence change may modulate - even reverse - provide sensory input stump amputation zone . For example , cortical reorganization alleviation phantom limb pain observe amputee follow intense use hand prosthesis . However , consistent knowledge type peripheral sensory feedback may effective affect cortical plasticity best apply sensory feedback . The aim propose research create natural , meaningful sensation provide non-invasive sensory feedback ( i.e . surface electrical stimulation ) effectiveness alleviate phantom limb pain restore cortical neuroplastic change .</brief_summary>
