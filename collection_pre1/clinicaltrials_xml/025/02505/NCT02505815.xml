	<brief_summary>Postoperative cognitive dysfunction ( POCD ) disease restrict cognitive memory function intellectual skill , occur surgery without anesthesia . The POCD strongly depend patient 's age surgical operation type . The anesthesia procedure play pivotal role well regard current knowledge still uncertain technique match low risk . Elevated stress level accompany regional anesthesia procedure accuse cause POCD elderly patient . The investigator address question weather regional general anesthesia lead pronounced POCD dependence stress incidence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Postoperative cognitive dysfunction ( POCD ) disease restrict cognitive memory function intellectual skill , occur surgery without anesthesia . The limit cognitive ability lead lack quality life lot patient . The POCD strongly depend patient 's age surgical operation type . In aged adult incidence POCD one week follow surgery 25,8 % . Risk factor development POCD beside age less education reduce cognitive reserve . However , anesthesia procedure play pivotal role well regard current knowledge still uncertain technique match low risk . Elevated stress level accompany regional anesthesia procedure accuse cause POCD elderly patient . This fact lead question general anesthesia technique low stress level consequently lead reduce risk POCD development . Likewise investigator address hypothesis analyze cognitive function follow anesthesia technique separately elderly patient .</detailed_description>
