	<brief_summary>Postural hypotension common old people , lead fall , decline function , dependence . Available treatment limit efficacy tolerability ; novel approach treatment therefore need . Decreased vascular health , stiffen artery consequent decrease vascular reactivity think contribute postural hypotension therefore therapeutic target . Recent trial evidence suggest vitamin K may exert beneficial effect vascular health particularly respect inhibit calcification . Calcification increase vascular stiffness , decrease compliance thus decrease ability blood vessel autoregulate blood pressure flow - could contribute postural drop blood pressure . Worsened vascular health could also impact adversely baroceptor function , need blood pressure autoregulation disrupt patient orthostatic hypotension . Vitamin K intake recommended daily intake 60 % adult UK . In animal , vitamin K supplementation may able reverse calcification artery , human Vitamin K show arrest decline carotid artery elasticity compare placebo . High level circulate vitamin K also associate low level CRP Framingham cohort , suggest possible role suppression chronic inflammation know accompany vascular disease . The recent ECKO study suggest vitamin K may reduce fall fracture ; intrigue question follow whether could due beneficial effect vascular health postural hypotension , lead less dizziness reduce fall . This cross-sectional comparative study aim find whether difference vitamin K status patient postural hypotension compare without postural hypotension whether difference vitamin K status associate marker vascular function patient without postural hypotension . This could potentially lead new treatment condition currently little proven benefit .</brief_summary>
