	<detailed_description>Obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) common disorder major cardiovascular sequela , include increase systemic hypertension stroke . OSA highly prevalent among patient cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , OSA remain under-diagnosed , thus under-treated . Furthermore , recent study confirm OSA associate impaired exercise capacity increase OSA severity predict worsen exercise capacity , marker potential increase cardiovascular risk . However , potential mechanism decrease exercise capacity cause OSA remain unclear . Several pathophysiologic mechanism OSA propose explain observation . Endothelial dysfunction one mechanism may result OSA-related intermittent hypoxemia , heighten sympathetic activation , increase blood pressure . Endothelial dysfunction characterize alteration normal endothelial physiology consist reduction bioavailability vasodilator nitric oxide lead impaired endothelium-depended vasodilation . Endothelial dysfunction consistently associate increased incidence CVD . Recent evidence also suggest correlation endothelial function exercise capacity . In addition , endothelial dysfunction pulmonary vasculature play integral role pathogenesis pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) , define mean pulmonary artery pressure exceed 25 mm Hg . PH associate increased mortality multiple morbidity include impaired exercise capacity . OSA formally recognize cause PH World Health Organization ( WHO ) estimate prevalence PH patient OSA 17 % . Repetitive nocturnal hypoxemia , increase sympathetic tone , diminish endothelial dependent vaso-reactivity contribute pulmonary artery hypoxic vasoconstriction , subsequently lead pulmonary vasculature remodel PH . Recently , PH induce exercise describe part PH spectrum may represent early , mild , PH still clinically relevant many patient . To detect early PH OSA patient may signify importance treatment compliance newly diagnose OSA patient . In summary , hypothesis OSA patient may endothelial dysfunction lead impair exercise capacity via exercise-induced pulmonary hypertension . If hypothesis correct , non-invasive measurement endothelial function could use clinically risk stratify patient follow response treatment .</detailed_description>
