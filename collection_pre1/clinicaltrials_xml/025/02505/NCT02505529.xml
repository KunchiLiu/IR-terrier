The main study consist 4 laboratory-based test session involve test muscle strength physical cognitive function well battery test 1 ) quantify brain excitability ( use non-invasive transcranial magnetic stimulation ) , 2 ) modulate brain excitability ( use non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation ) , 3 ) spinal motor nerve fire characteristic , 4 ) brain structure function characteristic base magnetic resonance image brain . Additionally , three option sub-studies also available enrollment . The first genetics sub-study cheek swab use examine association certain gene physiological functional measure obtain main study . The two sub-studies intervention . The first sub-study progressive resistance exercise training study study participant undergo 12-weeks exercise training ( 3x/wk ) completion exercise training measure obtain main study re-assessed . The sub-study mental imagery sub-study subject randomly assign perform mental imagery training program consist image strong muscle contraction mobility task ( 5x/wk ) serve control ( i.e. , modify lifestyle ) 6-weeks . At completion respective intervention period measure obtain main study re-assessed .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The UNCODE Study seek good identify neurological cause muscle weakness associate advancing age . The main study consist 4 laboratory-based test session involve test muscle strength physical cognitive function well battery test 1 ) quantify brain excitability ( use single pair pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation upper low extremity muscle ) , 2 ) modulate brain excitability upper extremity muscle ( use non-invasive transcranial direct current stimulation ) , 3 ) spinal motor nerve fire characteristic use decomposition surface electromyography , 4 ) brain structure function characteristic base magnetic resonance image brain . Additionally , three optional sub-studies also available enrollment . The first genetics sub-study cheek swab use examine association certain gene ( APOE-4 allele ) physiological functional measure obtain main study . The two sub-studies intervention . The first sub-study progressive resistance exercise training study study participant undergo 12-weeks exercise training ( 3x/wk ) completion exercise training measure obtain main study re-assessed . The sub-study mental imagery sub-study subject randomly assign perform mental imagery training program consist image strong muscle contraction mobility task ( 5x/wk ) serve control ( i.e. , modify lifestyle ) 6-weeks .

	<criteria>Age 60+ year significant health issue condition , investigator 's opinion , would limit subject 's ability complete study per protocol would impact capability get accurate measurement study endpoint . Body mass index 16.0 40.0 kg/m2 . With condition would limit participation supervise resistance training exercise base Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire ( PARQ ) ( `` Resistance Exercise Training SubStudy ) . Willingness maintain current diet adhere intervention program describe substudies ( applicable ) willing undergo testing procedure . Able read , understand , complete studyrelated questionnaire Able read understand , willing sign inform consent form ( ICF ) . Failure provide inform consent . Any activity daily living ( ADL ) disability ( difficulty feeding , dress , continence , bathing , toileting , transfer ) . Lives nursing home ; person live assisted independent housing exclude . Cognitive impairment , define know diagnosis dementia Modified MiniMental State exam score &lt; 24 Known neuromuscular neurological condition affect somatosensory motor function control ( e.g. , hemiplegia , multiple sclerosis , peripheral neuropathy , Parkinson 's disease , Myasthenia Gravis , Ataxia , Apraxia , postpolio syndrome , mitochondrial myopathy , etc. ) . Unable communicate severe hearing loss speech disorder . Severe visual impairment , would preclude completion assessment . Cancer require treatment currently past 2 year ( except primary nonmelanoma skin cancer situ cervical cancer ) Hospitalization ( medical confinement â‰¥24 hour ) , immobilization , major surgical procedure require general anesthesia within 12 week prior screen , plan surgical procedure study period . Chronic relapsing/remitting gastrointestinal disorder inflammatory bowel disease irritable bowel syndrome . Known history human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) antibody screen . Use systemic glucocorticoid . Severe pulmonary disease , require either steroid pill injection use supplemental oxygen . Severe cardiac disease , include New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class III IV congestive heart failure , clinically significant aortic stenosis , recent history cardiac arrest ( within 6months ) , use cardiac defibrillator , uncontrolled angina . Renal failure hemodialysis Psychiatric condition warrant acute chronic therapeutic intervention ( e.g. , major depressive disorder , bipolar disorder , panic disorder , schizophrenia ) investigator opinion may interfere conduct study procedure Unable undergo MRI transcranial magnetic stimulation ( TMS ) ( e. g. body contain metallic medical device equipment , include heart pacemaker , metal prosthesis , implant surgical clip , prior injury shrapnel grind metal , exposure metallic dust , metallic shaving tattoo contain metallic dye ) . Unable reliably undergo exercise strength test describe study . Participation progressive resistance exercise within previous 24 week prior screen ( substudies ) . Participation clinical trial within 12 week prior screen ( substudies ) . Limb amputation ( except toe ) and/or fracture within 24 week . Osteoarthritis , rheumatologic disease orthopedic disorder allow completion motion require resistance exercise ( Resistance Exercise Training SubStudy ) . Conditions ( myasthenia gravis , myositis , muscular dystrophy myopathy , include druginduced myopathy ) lead muscle loss , muscle weakness , muscle cramp myalgia . Acute viral bacterial upper low respiratory infection screen Abnormal uncontrolled blood pressure screen visit define diastolic BP &gt; 100 and/or systolic BP &gt; 170 mm Hg ; take antihypertensive medication , stable dos medication 3 month . Medications know alter investigator ' primary TMSbased outcome . For instance , individual take benzodiazepine exclude study participation . Current recent history ( within 1 year screen ) heavy alcohol consumption drug abuse investigator opinion may interfere conduct study procedure . Subjects follow abnormal ECG finding screen exclude : Electrocardiogram finding indicative leave ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) ( base Cornell voltage criterion ) : For men : S V3 plus R VL &gt; 2.8 milliVolts ( mV ) ( 28 mm ) For woman : S V3 plus R VL &gt; 2.0 mV ( 20 mm ) Electrocardiogram find QT prolongation</criteria>
