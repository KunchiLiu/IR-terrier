	<brief_summary>Limited stage Hodgkin lymphoma highly curable disease , standard treatment ABVD chemotherapy radiation lead late risk secondary cancer , lung injury , heart injury , others . This trial eliminate radiation therapy reduce intensity chemotherapy incorporate highly active FDA-approved target therapy brentuximab vedotin , antibody-drug conjugate specifically lymphoma cell , combine standard chemotherapy drug Adriamycin Dacarbazine ( AD ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Brentuximab Vedotin Plus AD Non-bulky Limited Stage Hodgkin Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This research study Phase II clinical trial . Phase II clinical trial test safety effectiveness investigational intervention learn whether intervention work treat specific disease . `` Investigational '' mean intervention study . It also mean FDA ( U.S. Food Drug Administration ) yet approve brentuximab vedotin ( brentuximab ) part initial treatment Hodgkin lymphoma . Currently , brentuximab FDA-approved treatment relapse Hodgkin lymphoma . - Brentuximab work bind specifically Hodgkin lymphoma cell , enter cell , release drug destroy cell . - The chemotherapy drug Adriamycin Dacarbazine ( AD ) participant receive research study approve use people Hodgkin Lymphoma . - Patients receive plan radiation therapy , drug bleomycin vinblastine .</detailed_description>

Because unknown potential risk adverse event nurse infant secondary treatment mother brentuximab , breastfeed discontinue mother treated brentuximab . These potential risk may also apply agent use study . Participants history different malignancy ineligible unless disease free 1 year consider low risk relapse , except : cervical cancer situ , ductal carcinoma situ , localized prostate cancer detectable disease image study , nonmelanoma cancer skin , eligible time .
