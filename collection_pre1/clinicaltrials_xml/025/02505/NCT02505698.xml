	<brief_summary>Three-dimensional functional Metabolic Imaging ( 3D MIRA ) new infrared imaging technology use Real Imager 8 ( RI8 ) develop Real Imaging . This technology generate 3D metabolic map breast base sophisticated machine learn technology , provide objective risk assessment presence malignant tumor breast . The procedure non-invasive , comfortable involve ionize radiation . It base acquire infrared image breast . Those image process analyzed computer provide objective risk assessment . The technology intend use screen tool breast cancer emerge highly useful woman screen mammography sub-optimal , woman dense breast . 3D MIRA unaffected breast density therefore ideal evaluate patient mammographically dense breast . Real Imaging continuously develop technology include image acquisition hardware objective analysis image biomarkers . To improve optimize novel metabolic image technology , Real Imaging introduce improve imaging device . The purpose clinical study collect image data order establish superiority new device previous one . The investigator hypothesize new device least good previous one .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Data Collection Study Evaluation Novel Infra-red Breast Imaging System Risk Assessment</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Breast cancer remain leading cause cancer death among woman , estimate 1 million new case 400,000 death annually worldwide . In recent year , however , improvement survival rate attribute earlier diagnosis national screening program well treatment . Although mammography main screening modality early detection , limitation difficulty interpret mammogram woman dense breast , well recognize search effective technology early detection receive increased attention . Previous study show US ( Ultra Sound ) detect breast cancer see Mammography , particularly dense breast . However , breast US sensitivity high highly operator-dependent . As opposed US , Breast MRI highly sensitive , however , use screen tool general population . The high cost MRI , relatively low speciÔ¨Åcity ( true negative rate ) , time consume need intravenous contrast agent make unsuitable breast screen tool general population . In light shortcoming , use exist screen modality describe base anatomical image result misdiagnosis cancer , particularly woman dense breast tissue.There real need novel breast image technology may outperform current modality available woman . The use infrared image breast cancer screen appeal concept , non-invasive , involve ionization radiation , require breast compression affect breast density . Infrared image form thermography , utilized past breast cancer screen limited success . Detection thermal asymmetry breast , point cancerous tissue , laborious inaccurate examining temperature cod image . Moreover , small focal thermal variation breast cause frequent misdiagnosis . Real Imaging develop new infrared imaging technology call 3D MIRA , ( Three-dimensional functional Metabolic Imaging Risk Assessment ) use medical device , Real Imager 8 ( RI8 ) . The MIRA technology generate three-dimensional ( 3D ) infrared ( IR ) metabolic map breast develop enable efficient , automate computer analysis metabolic map . Metabolic image detect signature cancer 's microenvironment ( e.g angiogenesis ) . A breast malignant tumor behaves differently healthy breast . In regard , breast tumor specific signatures surface breast even tumor deeply embedded inside . Metabolic image overcome limitation current mammography screen woman dense breast . The infrared signal contains information anatomical structure metabolic process within breast . Based infrared signal MIRA technology provide objective risk assessment presence malignant tumor . The risk assessment index represent likelihood give image dataset include malignant finding . The index scale range -100 ( normal ) 100 ( abnormal ) . The risk model base train parameter calibration set clinically know case . The Real Imager 8.0 ( RI8 ) compose two optical head , include infrared camera digital camera video projector . RI8 offer non-invasive method Metabolic Imaging Risk Assessment ( MIRA ) . The RI8 scan enables determination risk breast cancer malignancy , base assessment several metabolic parameter . The device provide diagnosis location cancer . It offer physician support tool guide patient image workup order locate , diagnose characterize tumor . The Imaging process follow : The imager position distance approximately 70 cm subject seat upright throughout examination . This position maintain throughout image session . An initial period temperature equilibrium precede image process , patient sits dedicate imaging room room temperature set 18-22 degree Celsius . Following temperature equilibration phase , continuous infrared imaging acquired period 7 minute . Two minute begin infrared recording , metabolic stress test induce patient wear cold glove ( 0-5 degree Celsius ) , remove 1 minute . This perform purpose generate vasoconstriction breast vessel . The entire imaging session last approximately 22 minute . The procedure comfortable , non-invasive emit involve ionize radiation . Real Imaging continuously develop technology include image acquisition hardware objective analysis image biomarkers . To improve optimize novel metabolic image technology , Real Imaging introduce improve imaging device . Improvements previous approve prototype device include high resolution frequency . Therefore need collect image data order establish superiority new device previous one . The Imaging data use assess clinical health status volunteer . Data collect study part Real Imaging 's ongoing research development effort aim create effective screening modality breast cancer . In data collection study , approximately 300 female subject enrol The Breast Imaging Unit Tel-Aviv Medical Center . MIRA 's risk assessment provide physician subject . In order evaluate MIRA 's ability classify healthy woman breast cancer , enrollment include two group : 1 . Screening Group - healthy woman breast finding previous screen exams 2 . Pre-Biopsy Group - woman suspicious finding recent Mammography and/or US and/or MRI exams BI-RADS ( Breast Imaging-Reporting Data System ) 4/5/6 summon biopsy workup . Eligible recruited subject sign informed consent undergo MIRA image prior image conventional imaging method relevant , prior undergo breast biopsy . MIRA 's data every individual patient use development purpose . The subject 's personal , medical , diagnostic examination information pathology result record CRF ( case report form ) specially design study . Each subject 's clinical information follow order validate MIRA 's result .</detailed_description>
