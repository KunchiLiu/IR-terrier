	<brief_title>A Study Evaluate Efficacy Safety Infliximab Participant With Moderate-to-Severe Refractory Intestinal Behcet 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This open-label ( participant know identity intervention ) , single arm , multicenter ( one hospital medical school team work medical research study ) study Infliximab participant Moderate-to-Severe Refractory Intestinal Behcet 's Disease . The study consist 3 Phases : Screening Phase ( 4 week ) , induction Phase 8 week , maintenance Phase 24 week extend Week 0 ( baseline ) , safety Follow visit ( Week 36 approximately 6 week last administration study drug ) . The duration participation study participant approximately 40 week . The mean decrease Disease Activity Index intestinal Behcet 's disease ( DAIBD ) score 20 evaluate primarily . Participants ' safety monitor throughout study .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Participant diagnose definite probable intestinal Behcet 's Disease ( BD ) prior Screening Participant must active intestinal BD , define ; ) A baseline Disease Activity Index intestinal Behcet 's disease ( DAIBD ) score great equal ( &gt; = ) 40 ; b ) Endoscopy evidence active intestinal BD ( define ulceration ileum and/or colon ) . The endoscopy must occur within 3 month prior baseline Must either currently receive treatment , history fail respond , tolerate , least 1 follow therapy assess treat physician : oral corticosteroid , 6mercaptopurine ( 6MP ) , azathioprine ( AZA ) , methotrexate ( MTX ) . ) Have response oral corticosteroid within precede 18 month ; b ) Have response 6MP , AZA MTX within precede 5 year Prior baseline , follow condition must meet : ) If receive 6MP , AZA , MTX must receive least 12 week , dose must stable least 4 week ; b ) If 6MP , AZA , MTX recently discontinue , must stop least 4 week ; c ) If receive oral 5aminosalicylate ( 5ASA ) compound oral corticosteroid , dose must stable least 2 week ; ) If oral 5ASA compound oral corticosteroid recently discontinue , must stop least 2 week ; e ) If receive cyclosporine , dose must stable least 6 week ; f ) If cyclosporine recently discontinue , must stop least 6 week Participant must medically stable basis physical examination , medical history , vital sign 12lead electrocardiogram ( ECG ) perform Screening . If abnormality , must consistent underlie illness study population , participant may include investigator judge abnormality normal clinically significant appropriate . This determination must record participant 's source document investigator Participant complication intestinal BD symptomatic stricture stenosis , short gut syndrome , central nervous system vascular manifestation , manifestation might anticipate require surgery , could preclude use DAIBD ass response therapy , would possibly confound ability assess effect treatment infliximab Participant currently suspect abscess . Recent cutaneous perianal abscess exclusionary drain adequately treat least 3 week prior baseline , 8 week prior baseline intraabdominal abscess , provide anticipated need surgery . Participants active fistula may include anticipation need surgery currently abscesses identify Participant kind bowel resection within 6 month intraabdominal surgery within 3 month prior baseline Participant draining ( ie , function ) stoma ostomy Participant receive follow prescribed medication therapy within specified period : ) Intravenous ( IV ) corticosteroid within 3 week prior baseline ; b ) Other oral immunomodulatory agent ( eg , 6thioguanine ( 6TG ) , tacrolimus , sirolimus , mycophenolate mofetil ) within 6 week prior baseline ; c ) Nonbiologic experimental investigational agent within 4 week within 5 halflives agent prior baseline , whichever longer ; ) Other immunomodulatory biologic agent within 12 week within 5 halflives agent prior baseline , whichever longer ; e ) Treatment apheresis ( eg , Adacolumn apheresis ) total parenteral nutrition ( TPN ) treatment intestinal BD within 3 week prior baseline</criteria>
