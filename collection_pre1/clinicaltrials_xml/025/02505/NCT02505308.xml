	<detailed_description>Introduction : Working collaborator part ongoing genetic study , investigator identify several genetic variation ( DNA change ) associate production processing insulin try understand genetic variation cause differences people 's ability produce process insulin . Their finding lead improve understanding pancreas produce process insulin meal help improve understanding people develop diabetes people , despite similar level obesity . This question great public health significance unlikely prevalence obesity fall dramatically foreseeable future . The investigator would like test hypothesis individual carry different genetic variation different ability produce process insulin . They test consequence genetic variation pancreas produce insulin response meal component meal , sugar amino acid . Study design : This prospective `` recruit genotype '' cohort study test role several genetic variant ( combination variant ) 4 year period ( late 2014 late 2018 ) . The genetic variant choose strong evidence role pancreas insulin secretion . Each genetic variant involve different set research volunteer slightly different set test . Participants blind genetic variant status . Some genetic variant identify next 4 year possible define outset detail methodology cohort study . This protocol therefore write describe core protocol relevant whole study , appendix describe specific cohort within study . Since general management ethical issue overarch , new genetic variant identify 4 year study period , cohort-specific appendix add major amendment , rather submit cohort separate ethic application . The procedure recruitment test set research volunteer except component outline cohort-specific appendix . Study participant : All participant identify exist research cohort manage NIHR Exeter Research Facility ( Exeter CRF ) and/or Oxford Biobank ( OBB ) recruitment facilitate within Exeter CRF and/or Oxford Centre Diabetes , Endocrinology Medicine ( OCDEM ) . Individuals identify variant interest gender , age BMI match control . All potential participant 'blinded ' Data Manager study team know participant variant control . They invite study letter , provide study information sheet study team contact detail . A member study team contact within 2-3 week determine whether interested participating , offer great explanation study entail , check eligibility . If agree take part , verbal consent fast visit seek appointment make confirm writing/by email . Identifying genetic variation : Measuring genetic factor individual ongoing process involve routine lab measure use single exist DNA sample volunteer provide participation Exeter 10000 Project/OBB . As June 2014 , Exeter 94 genetic variant ( aka DNA change ) measure 5600 EXTEND volunteer 800,000 genetic variant subset 1700 EXTEND volunteer . During course next 4 year , genetic measure extend participant ( 10,000 ) variant ( 800,000+ ) . These data return EXTEND/OBB database require . Individuals identify genetic variation interest invite participate ( 30-50 , dependent associate specific test ) together similar number gender , age , BMI match control individual without variation interest . The definition match sex , age +/- 1 year , BMI within 1 kgm2 unit range may broaden enough individual available tight definition . Visit procedure : All participant ask fast overnight ( 10 pm night ) , avoid strenuous exercise smoking 24 hour prior attend morning visit Exeter CRF/OCDEM ( approx 2-4 hour depend test choice ) . Participants ask sign write consent form prior data collection test . Patients lack capacity consent recruit . Participants give opportunity contact member research team discus project detail desire . All participant inform nature purpose study , requirement possible hazard , right withdraw time study without prejudice without jeopardy future clinical care . All participant undergo core data collection , measurement provide fast stimulated blood sample . A cohort participant may ask return second visit undergo test provide comparison measure . Test choice depend genetic variation study - detailed cohort-specific appendix . Core data collection , measurement sample participant - approx . 1 hour Anthropometry : data , include Height ( ) , Weight ( Kg ) , Waist ( cm ) Hip ( cm ) circumference , record . Medical history : include current medication lifestyle information ( smoking/alcohol ) . BOD POD : Participants ask fat mass measure BOD POD . This non-invasive technique provide accurate measure fat mass compare bioimpedence measure , measure height weight . Participants opt test exclude study . Detailed body composition measure obtain use Body Composition Tracking System . This briefly comprise BOD POD machine , electronic scale , computer . It use principle body densitometry ( measure mass volume ) calculate participant 's percentage absolute amount fat fat free mass . Participants ask wear minimal clothing ( e.g . swim costume ) close fit swim hat . They stand electric scale record weight calibrate BOD POD . Participants ask sit inside BOD POD 1 minute time ( max 3 time ) . The computer analyze generate result . Blood sample : A small cannula ( thin plastic tube ) insert vein , follow standard clinical practice minimise potential trauma repeat blood sampling . Fasted sample obtain baseline measure ( include routine glucose lipid measurement ) , DNA , plasma , serum , storage future batch analysis include measure glucose insulin marker interest . Stimulated blood sample obtain participant . The choice stimulation agent dependent specific genetic variation study . At end test period , cannula remove participant offered breakfast/refreshments . Definitions genotypes interest detail visit ( ) provide protocol 's cohort-specific appendix . In addition core data collection , measurement fast sample , cohort undertake two test describe . A : Glucose-Potentiated Arginine-Induced Insulin secretion ( GPAIS ) - approx . 1Â½ hrs Rationale . This test design primarily test maximum insulin secretion capacity participant 's beta cell . It provide best available surrogate beta cell mass , oppose beta cell function ( Kahn 2008 ) therefore help improve understanding mechanism choose genetic variant influence risk diabetes . It recently show correlate well number ( autologous ) islet transplant pancreatitis patient follow pancreatectomy . In dogs non-human primate correlate well % beta cell mass ( review Kahn 3 ) . The test base well-described ( Kahn 2008 ; Larsson &amp; Ahren 1998 ) principle non-glucose secretagogue , amino acid arginine , produce great insulin response potentiate high glucose level , combine stimulus produce near maximal beta cell response . The GPAIS test involve 5 stage : 1 . Set . Intravenous catheter insert antecubital vein arm . One arm use infusion glucose/amino acid , arm intermittent sample . Blood glucose concentration monitor regular YSI measure throughout test . 2 . AIRarg ( acute insulin response arginine ) . Baseline sample take -2 -0 min . A maximally stimulating bolus dose arginine hydrochloride ( 5 g ) inject intravenously 45 s. Samples collect +2 , +3 , +4 +5 min . 3 . Acute insulin response intravenous glucose ( unvalidated measure acute insulin response intravenous glucose AIRglucose ) . Next high-speed ( 900 ml/hr ) 20 % glucose infusion 10-25 minute commence ( total volume infuse 410 ml ) . Samples collect -5 , -2 min ( start high speed infusion ) 2 minute interval 10 minute follow start glucose infusion . 4 . AIRMAXarg . When glucose level reach 20mmol/L ( 25 min max ) , repeat baseline sample take , glucose infusion lower 300ml/hr second arginine hydrochloride ( 5 g ) bolus inject , follow final +2 , +3 , +4 +5 min sample . 5 . Recovery monitoring glucose insulin participant 's glucose level return baseline . Samples glucose insulin collect every 10 minute 50 minute end AIRMAXarg test monitor participant 's recovery provide measure insulin sensitivity . Blood sugar monitor regular YSI measure participant 's blood sugar return safe level . The participant give light lunch end period . Samples : time point insulin glucose measure . Spare aliquots save stored -80oC potential additional analysis , glucagon C-peptide . B : Intravenous Glucose Tolerance Test ( IGTT aka IVGTT ) - approx . 30 minute Rationale . This test accept , standard measure first phase insulin secretion involve neurohormonal ( incretin ) absorption effect oral glucose challenge . C : Oral Glucose Tolerance Test ( OGTT ) - approx . 2.5 hrs Rationale . This test accept , standard measure insulin secretion absorption effect oral glucose challenge . D : Stool sample faecal elastase measurement Rationale . This test hypothesis genetic polymorphism may influence exocrine pancreatic function addition pancreatic endocrine function . The participant provide specimen container , prepaid pad envelope , transport container , instruction collect post faecal sample analysis . Provision faecal sample optional essential inclusion study .</detailed_description>
