	<brief_title>The Use Modified ride-on Cars Advance Mobility Socialization Young Children With Disabilities</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Children mobility disability limit opportunity explore environment ; therefore , consider risk secondary impairment , cognitive , spatial-perceptual , social-emotional delay . Independent mobility believe essential perceptual-motor social skill development . Self-produced locomotion organizer psychological change typically develop infants/children , especially developmental change perception , social understanding , spatial cognitive , emotion . Power mobility device provide potential child disability move independently increase exploration interaction social physical environment . Through exploration , infant detect object individual‟s information relate size , orientation , shape , substance perceptual movement capability interpersonal relationship . Logically , start power mobility part comprehensive Early Intervention ( EI ) program within first year life provide mobility also reduce secondary impairment child disability . Although increase interest , little empirical evidence effect even feasibility early power mobility training development , particularly mobility socialization . A hallmark daily life typically develop infant toddler hour mobility nest within exploration , socialization object play home community.Pediatric rehabilitation , train assistive technology ( AT ) , seek provide child disability level mobility , exploration socialization . There many basic barrier achieve high standard single AT combination AT currently provide level mobility child , family therapist desire . For example , certain characteristic common commercial pediatric power wheelchair limit use home community space playgrounds . These limitation include price ( e.g. , typically $ 5000 ) , size weight ( e.g. , typically &gt; 150 lb ) , transportation requirement ( e.g. , van truck ) , maintenance aesthetic social acceptance . The obvious limitation include power mobility EI program complete lack readily available power chair child young 2-3 year age , period mobility rapidly develop typically develop child . Experimental power mobility device potential address limitation size , weight infant use . Unfortunately likely year commercial availability . Furthermore , power wheelchair historically design address limit set goal related mobility minimal consideration socialization . Investigators believe need readily available mobility option immediate use young child family address limitation expand role power device past simply mobility socialization . The general purpose study determine feasibility use `` ride-on toy car '' early option power mobility . Furthermore , study examine effect use toy car advance mobility socialization early development . The use modify ride-on toy car may provide readily available , convenient fun way family , therapist early educator help young child improve mobility start within first year life . There four strength use ride-on toy car mobility . First , cost comparable less mobility device . Second , relatively lightweight , small easily transport contrast power chair . Third , child-friendly , colorful toy design acceptable adult child likely see simply toy . This may important aspect clinician want start early power mobility training family hesitant discus power chair option . Fourth , toy car simple electromachanical device , modify quickly easily match child 's current and/or future ability goal . Ride-on car provide fun mobility typically develop child serious potential power mobility option child disability . Investigators recently publish technical report out basic component exemplar modification . Our pilot study also show positive effect increase socialization 2-year old child severe cerebral palsy . No study publish effectiveness even feasibility include car pediatric population . Thus basic question sit tolerance , basic drive ability interest use car socialization address prior wide spread clinical use . The long term effect use mobility device mobility socialization also remain question researcher clinician . In addition , little known learn curve use power mobility device improve mobility socialization , e.g. , point time ( maximal ) effect reach . Up , study focus end result increase amount independent mobility daily life . It still unknown whether optimal ( maximal ) effect reach factor ( e.g. , train environment , train executor ) might influence learn curve well retention treatment effect long term . In study Tieman et al . ( 2004 ) , suggest therapist examine child 's performance setting important daily life . Examining performance everyday setting enable therapist observe child 's ability , also assess environmental feature either facilitate hinder mobility . Our study focus provide intervention exploratory assessment home clinical setting . This information essential making future decision whether intervention focus child‟s motor ability therapeutic environment therapist 's perspective , adaptation natural environment caregiver 's application . In study , investigator modify ride-on toy car child disability use clinical setting part 18-week power mobility training program . Investigators focus four basic question . Specifically , investigator : 1 ) select modify toy car child motor impairment enjoy sit driving , 2 ) select set dependent measure quantify whether child increase independent mobility socialization ; 3 ) determine factor influence learn curve independent mobility socialization intervention follow-up phase ; 4 ) conduct hospital-based training program result high level fun child compliance family therapist . If result generally positive show significant difference different program , future randomize control trial study could quantify effectiveness feasibility different treatment intensity various pediatric population . Evidence support independent mobility might improve different skill child mobility impairment , include spatial awareness skill , eye-hand coordination , visual perceptual skill , spontaneous vocalization , initiation contact others , motivation explore increase ability interact meaningfully peer . Although mobility device consider used compensate disability cause difficulty accomplishment daily activity social role , current standard clinical practice United States power wheelchair train child must demonstrate certain prerequisite ability eligible . As result , power mobility training , base readiness , offer clinically child 2 6 year old , 3 year average age young child recommend power wheelchair.However , several study demonstrate early power mobility training feasible , even child may categorize `` not-ready '' group base age , motor cognitive ability . These child various type disability limit self produce locomotion . Most young 3 year age young one 7-month-old . The early power mobility training allow young child mobility impairment move independently positive impact overall development . The investigator report increased vocalization , increase arm hand movement , great motivation explore , increase self-confidence curiosity positive effect family life child . Power mobility device design compensate child 's impairment independent mobility , also use novel , train device address socialization , body function , activity participation goal . Combined family center ( e.g. , coach parent ) , functional approach aim promote well function context daily life setting ( e.g. , home environment ) , early power mobility training help enhance development improve social participation child 's daily life . Current power wheelchair limitation limit functional use community . These include size , weight , cost , accessibility , ease transportation , maintenance requirement , adaptability body growth social acceptance . Experimental device potential address limitation size , weight cost may year commercial availability . Providing new option device early power mobility address environmental limitation necessary . Furthermore , device also use focus three ICF level train tool . For example , technique report modify ride-on toy car power mobility device introduces alternative way provide early power mobility training . Compared traditional pediatric power wheelchair , strength modify toy car include less cost , accessibility community environment , well aesthetic adjustability . Moreover , modify toy car unlike power wheelchair medical device typically focus activity participation level ICF . Various permanent temporary modification toy car allow clinician address one ICF level . For example , trunk support may help child reach steer wheel grasp toy car movement address ICF activity goal . By lessen trunk support modification combination simple steer system ( e.g. , push-button switch ) , clinician provide child challenging , dynamic postural control drive address ICF body function structure goal . The child-friendly frame toy car motivate child 's exploratory behavior may positive impact family 's and/or people 's perception child 's capability . These strength ride toy car make become appropriate candidate family therapist improve early independent mobility socialization child mobility disability . The specific aim study : 1 ) examine feasibility provide child disability explore environment modify ride-on car ; 2 ) quantify whether child disability able social interaction ride-on car ; 3 ) examine progression socialization determine factor might influence learn curve intervention follow-up phase ; 4 ) compare effectiveness use modify toy car hospital-based program regular therapy program determine critical factor increase independent mobility socialization intervention follow-up phase , include motivation , treatment executor , treatment environment play program . Through comparison Car Play ( i.e. , play use toy car ) Natural Play ( i.e. , play without use toy car ) , investigator hypothesize child disability able learn drive modify toy car hospital-based group . They increase socialization ( i.e. , self-initiated contact , vocalization , positive facial expression ) drive car regular therapy program , i.e. , control group . Study Design : A pretest-posttest control group design apply . Two group involve project : hospital base program , regular therapy program .
