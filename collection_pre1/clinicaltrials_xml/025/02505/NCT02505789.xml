	<brief_summary>In many country , numerous step take minimize risk infection transfuse blood product . Typically , blood banking organisation screen array infectious pathogen part quality control protocol . While transmission test agent via transfusion become exceedingly rare , risk transfusion-transmitted infection test currently perform continue concern . Among untested infectious agent Epstein-Barr virus ( EBV , also know human herpesvirus-4 ) . Most notably , infection virus transplant recipient give rise malignant disorder call post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease ( PTLD ) , life-threatening complication due uncontrolled expansion EBV-infected cell . It also associate complication hepatitis , hemophagocytic syndrome , etc . transplant population . It recognise EBV infection occur transfuse immune suppress graft recipient origin viral infection still matter debate . It known fact EBV already present recipient 's blood undergo reactivation due immune suppression . However , know occur frequently patient EBV-seronegative time transplant , also accept primary infection contract via infect graft source virus . The question seek answer whether immune suppress graft recipient acquire primary EBV infection via transfusion blood product . EBV present blood adult case EBV transfusion-related infection report . Transplant population generally transfuse large volume blood product recent pilot study support possibility transfusion-related EBV infection transmit pediatric hematopoietic stem cell ( HSCT ) recipient ( Trottier et al , 2012 ) . The aim study analyse risk EBV transmission blood product transfusion pediatric allogeneic HSCT patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>All patient recruit approximately 1 month transplantation ( pre-transplant conditioning chemotherapy pre-surgery evaluation ) followed-up 1 year post-transplantation . Thus , subject followed-up 13-month period . At entry , questionnaire document socio-demographic data pre-transplant clinical indicator age , gender , primary diagnosis , previous chemotherapy , previous transfusion , etc . During follow-up , case report form ( CRF ) allow prospective reporting variable pertain EBV serology , transplantation , blood product transfusion EBV complication . EBV PCR serology test : This study observational use result EBV PCR EBV serology allow objective achieve considerable cost reduction . Time zero patient receive graft . Some test do time zero ( pre-transplant array test include EBV serology ) . After time zero , site , follow-up treatment protocol include EBV PCR test . Pre-transplant serum recipient donor test standard method mmunoglobulin G ( IgG ) antibodies EBV capsid antigen ( VCA ) , IgG antibodies EBV early antigen ( EA ) anticomplement antibody EBV nuclear antigen ( EBNA ) . EBV DNA test perform quantitative polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) . Each centre establish threshold value determine viral load . In order properly interpret patient ' viral load data participate center , require fill site report form ( SRF ) describe test method EBV PCR EBV serology . Pre-transplant measurement EBV antibody : Serology test , include EBV seroprevalence , always do participate site pre-transplant evaluation ( condition chemotherapy ) donor recipient . Serology test test use confirm presence virus blood . For graft provide external site , donor blood sample always available allow serology test laboratory center transplantation perform . Serology test do cord-blood donor virtually always negative EBV . Donors recipient classify accord pre-transplant serology status : 1 ) past infection ( VCA EBNA IgG titer &gt; 10 ) , 2 ) recent infection immune suppress ( VCA IgG titer &gt; 10 EBNA IgG titer &lt; 10 ) , 3 ) reactivate infection ( VCA , EBNA EA IgG titer &gt; 10 ) , 4 ) na√Øve ( serological sign prior infection ) . Post-transplant EBV DNA PCR testing : HSCT recipient closely follow EBV infection post-transplant period . Although blood product transfusion occur peri-transplant period , possible patient receive blood product later time post-transplantation . Follow-up EBV PCR result complication related EBV therefore continue one year post-transplant ( time death ) . This time window allow documentation entire clinical trajectory HSCT . Protocols follow-up transplant , diagnosis treatment EBV disease allogeneic graft recipient review participate site . The incidence EBV infection recipient measure quantitative real-time PCR testing perform AT MINIMUM every 1-2 week time transplant hospital discharge ( usually around 6 week post-transplantation ) . After hospital discharge , EBV PCR monitoring perform every clinical follow-up visit : AT LEAST twice per month approximately 4-6 month post-transplant long patient remain immune suppress . Thereafter , approximately one EBV PCR per month perform 1-year post-transplant . In sum , incidence EBV infection adequately measure 1-year follow-up period . In site , AT LEAST 1 EBV PCR test do per 1-2 week hospitalization , 2 EBV PCR test per month hospital discharge 6 month post-transplantation approximately 1 EBV PCR test per month 6 month 12 month . The total number EBV PCR result collect per patient entire follow-up approximately 18 . These result retrieve patient chart . PTLD complication related EBV : Clinical outcome high increase viral load EBV infection PTLD routinely screen one year post-transplant . PTLD diagnosis make accord WHO criterion ( Swerdlow et al , 2008 ) base clinical radiologic sign coexist EBV-positive PCR blood specimen . Information relate PTLD collect case report form . All complication possibly relate EBV ( example : hemophagocytic syndrome , hepatitis , etc . ) also document . An adjudicating committee ( C. Buteau C Alfieri ) review patient-specific data element confirm PTLD complication related EBV . Transfused blood product : Data blood product transfuse collect include descriptor blood product unit ( type blood product , number unit , length storage , etc . ) , volume transfuse ( milliliter ) , duration transfusion , well date time transfusion . Total volume receive every blood product consider analysis well number transfusion . A site report form ( SRF ) also fill participate center document transfusion protocol type blood product use HSCT , leukoreduction , type red blood cell ( RBCs ) ( wash , irradiate , CMV negative , etc . ) , type plasma ( fresh frozen plasma , frozen plasma , solvent detergent plasma ) , type platelet concentrate ( apheresis , pool , etc , ) , maximum length storage ( day ) , etc . Determining source EBV severe EBV infection : In order demonstrate definitively virus transfuse blood product link severe complication high increase viral load EBV infection/PTLD , genotype EBV strain patient . Blood unit administer patient trace back donor turn ( consent ) serologically assess EBV , seropositive donor EBV strain genotyped comparison patient 's strain . Many blood donor per case trace recipient receive blood product many blood donor ( 1 unit RBC provide 1 donor , 1 unit plasma provide 1 donor 1 unit platelet provide 4 donor ) . In average , expect 25 donor trace per case ( estimate pilot data ; Trottier et al , 2012 ) . We use trace blood donor graft recipient report Alfieri et al . ( 1996 ) . Brief procedure EBV genotyping : 10 ml blood ( 2 ml infect pediatric patient ) separate density centrifugation Ficoll-hypaque gradient . The mononuclear cell fraction harvest , wash culture presence cyclosporine allow outgrowth donor 's EBV-positive cell establishment immortalized EBV-positive B cell line . The viral DNA within line amplify PCR use primer BamHI-K region EBV-genome , know highly polymorphic among various EBV strain . The different sized fragment amplified region distinguish migration agarose gel ( Alfieri et al , 1996 ) . In order verify result identity patient blood donor also employ EBNA-typing technique perform western blot analysis use define EBNA-positive serum ( Alfieri et al , 1996 ) .</detailed_description>
