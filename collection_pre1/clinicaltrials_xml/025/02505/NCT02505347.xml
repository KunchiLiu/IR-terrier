	<brief_summary>Distal biceps rupture occur commonly among young male third fourth decade life . These injury become common , however , age population remain active sport labour demand . Distal biceps tear rupture follow heavy eccentric load place shorten flexed muscle , often require surgical repair . Functionally , distal biceps injury cause impairment portion muscle largely responsible supination flexion elbow . Currently consensus regard post-operative immobilization protocol , little evidence available regard timeframe early return functional activity . Existing evidence functional outcome post distal biceps tendon repair ( DBTR ) low quality small sample size , know RCTs exist compare early mobilization immobilization functional return . Reported timeframes immobilization range early control motion day 1 post-operatively complete immobilization 6 week . The primary study goal determine effect immobilization compare unrestricted mobility post DBTR early functional return activity . It previously report DBTR related worker compensation injury return full duty 3.95 month , non-workers compensation relate injury return full work duty 1.35 month . In Alberta , near 100 WCB claim make DBTR 2013 2014 . Early mobilization repair may allow early return modify full work duty , thereby improve functional quality life individual well reduce overall cost disability payment . This study assess 1 ) time return pre-injury work level 2 ) time return modify duty among movement restriction post-repair splint 6 week . Re-rupture rate group also assess strength , range motion ( ROM ) quality life . These finding assist develop standardize protocol immobilization optimize functional clinical outcome expedite return work .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Early Functional Return Work Following Distal Biceps Repair</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Research Questions : In patient immobilized 6 week allow unrestricted movement follow DBTR , Are differences first post-operative year : 1 . Time return work ( modify pre-injury level ) ? 2 . The proportion subject ( ) re-rupture . Strength ( flexion , supination ) elbow b. ROM ( flexion , supination ) elbow c. Self-reported functional quality life d. Pain group Research Hypotheses : 1 . A short time return work ( modify pre-injury level ) identify unrestricted movement group compare immobilize group . 2 . Less 2 % patient either group re-rupture first post-operative year . 3 . Patients unrestricted movement group great early improvement ) strength ; b ) ROM ; c ) functional quality life score ; ) pain first 3-6 postoperative month compare immobilized group . Theoretical significance practical importance Currently consensus regard post-operative immobilization protocol , little evidence available regard timeframe early return functional activity follow DBTR . Existing evidence functional outcome post DBTR low quality small sample size , know RCTs exist compare early mobilization immobilization functional return . Reported timeframes immobilization range early control motion day 1 post-operatively complete immobilization 6 week . The primary study goal determine effect immobilization 6 week post-operatively compare unrestricted mobility post DBTR early functional return activity . It previously report DBTR related worker compensation injury return full duty 3.95 month , non-workers compensation relate injury return full work duty 1.35 month . In Alberta , near 100 WCB claim make annually DBTR 2013 2014 . Early mobilization repair may allow early return modify full work duty , thereby improve functional quality life individual well reduce overall cost disability payment . Research plan methodology Design/Setting : This study parallel randomize control trial computer generate randomization block stratify surgeon . Patient enrollment follow-up occur primarily Sturgeon Community Hospital ( SCH ) . Sample Size To ensure study properly power detect difference group power = 0.90 , α = 0.05 , µ1 = 14 ( unrestricted mobility ) , µ2 = 21 ( immobilize ) , δ = 10 , total 88 participant require ( 44 group ) . To allow attrition sample size first year , enroll 100 subject ( 50 study arm ) . This calculation base conservative estimate 1 week difference return work group . If group difference great 1 week remain well-powered . If group difference le 1 week , likely clinically important difference group . This sample size 100 also sufficient allow sub-analyses participant WCB claimant adequately power compare secondary tertiary outcome group , exception re-ruptures , expect low group . Screening Enrollment Patients screen study eligibility initial preoperative clinic visit attend surgeon research coordinator . The research coordinator track reason exclusion , either patient refusal surgeon exclusion base patient characteristic . Those consent sign complete informed consent form undergo baseline evaluation . Baseline Evaluation : Consented subject undergo pre-operative assessment study therapist independent clinical care . The assessment consist 1 ) baseline demographic form ( age , mechanism injury , past current medical status , work activity demand ; dominant hand ) , 2 ) work-related question ( i.e . occupation , employment status , type work perform ) 3 ) Quick Disabilities Arm , Shoulder , Hand questionnaire ( Q-DASH ) , 4 ) visual analogue scale ( VAS ) pain rest activity 5 ) bilateral elbow ROM plan supination flexion , 6 ) bilateral elbow strength flexion supination use handheld dynamometer ( microFET3 , Hoggan Health Industries Inc. , West Jordan , UT ) , 7 ) ultrasound MRI confirm diagnosis . Imaging pre-operative stage standard care , dependent study involvement . All data collect use standardized form enter password-protected database . Intervention Based upon surgeon ' ability perform tension free repair , subject randomize follow surgery either : 1. immobilize 6 week postoperative 2. unrestricted mobility Those immobilize group splint per current care 6 week , remove splint personal care active-assisted ROM gentle stretch exercise , prescribe occupational/physical therapist . Those unrestricted mobility able move joint tolerate post-operatively , avoid heavy lifting ( &gt; 5 pound ) first six postoperative week . Those patient consent , exclude time surgery note determine proportion patient able participate early mobilization regimen . Reasons exclusion record . Rehabilitation Each patient refer course physiotherapy post-operatively . Although principle tissue heal follow group , patient unrestricted mobility group likely start progressive resisted activity 6-8 week post-operatively immobilize group likely start progressive resisted activity 8-10 week post-operatively . Time ( day ) splint immobilize group record time splint apply post-operatively date splint fully discontinue . Start end date physiotherapy record timing commence resisted activity . Follow-up Evaluation Participants reassess research coordinator surgeon usual clinic follow-up 6 week , 3 6 month . Participants reassess research coordinator 12 month post-operatively . At visit outcome record include : current work status ( yet work , modify , full duty ) date return work , ROM measurement , Q-DASH questionnaire , VAS pain scale . Any complication related injury cause delay return work also note . Commencing 3 month visit continue subsequent visit , strength also assess use myometer . Start end date physiotherapy treatment record compare rehabilitation course group . Ultrasound image perform 12 month , history re-injury confirm integrity repair . Analysis We use quantitative analytical method . Descriptive statistic ( frequency , proportion , mean variation ) determine variable . For primary outcome ( time [ day ] return modified duty ) use unpaired t-test ass difference group . T-tests also use analyze secondary outcome ( time return pre-injury level work , re-rupture rate , Q-DASH score ) , time ( day ) splint immobilize group report descriptively ( mean ) . Tertiary outcome ( strength , ROM , Q-DASH ) analyze use two-way repeat measure ANOVA examine trajectory recovery group . A sub-analysis performed assess primary secondary outcome immobilize unrestricted mobility group identify work related injury compare non-work related injury use analysis covariance ( ANCOVA ) . All analyse two-tailed level significance α=0.05 .</detailed_description>
