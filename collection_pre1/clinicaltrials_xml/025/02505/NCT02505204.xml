	<detailed_description>Introduction Paravertebral block ( PVB ) show successful child adult . It report excellent pain reliever reduce post-operative nausea vomiting , patient undergo breast surgery . PVB proven useful regional anesthetic technique come surgery involve lumbar thoracic dermatome . It show PVB combine light intravenous sedation associate short hospital stay , less post-operative nausea vomiting ( PONV ) reduce analgesic consumption compare general anesthesia ventral hernia repair . Given effectiveness PVB ventral hernia repair , would beneficial study effect PVB versus without clonidine elderly patient . Objectives : The primary objective study compare hemodynamic stability ventral hernia repair use paravertebral block clonidine versus PVB without clonidine . The secondary objective include comparison PONV postoperative analgesic consumption . Materials Methods Study design sample This prospective study randomize double- blind design conduct August 2015 August 2016 . Patients scheduled ventral hernia repair whose age 65 year old American Society Anesthesiologists ( ASA ) great equal 2 include . Exclusion criterion comprise history allergic reaction local anesthetic , bleed diatheses spinal abnormality . Patients randomly allocate one 2 group 30 patient , use seal envelope technique . Group one receive PVB clonidine group 2 receive PVB placebo . Anesthetic technique Since trial double-blinded , specialized nurse prepare syringe patient . Paravertebral nerve block technique Bilateral nerve-stimulator PVB perform level T9-T10 T9-T11 accord type ventral hernia plan incision type . The patient anesthetize lateral decubitus position . Supplemental oxygen give facemask regular anesthetic monitor attach . Each local anesthetic mixture contain : For group 1 , syrinx contain : lidocaine 2 % 6 mL , lidocaine 2 % 6 mL epinephrine 5µg.mL-1 , bupivacaine 0.5 % 5 mL , fentanyl 1 mL ( 50µg ) clonidine 2 mL . As group 2 , anesthetic mixture administrate however clonidine substitute 2 mL saline . Data collection Demographic data , ASA score , type duration surgery record . Haemodynamics register mean arterial blood pressure , heart rate oxygen saturation , preoperatively ( baseline ) , intra-operatively ( incision skin , dissection hernia , traction sac closure incision ) postoperatively . As postoperative analgesia consumption , patient VAS score three four give Tramadol Hydrochloride 50-100 mg every 4- 6 hour . If VAS score great equal five , patient receive 1 mg/kg Dolosal . Post-operative nausea vomit record recovery room regular ward . Pain assessment take patient verbal statement use Numeric Rating Scale .</detailed_description>
