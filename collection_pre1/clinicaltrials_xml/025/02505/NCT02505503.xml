	<brief_summary>Some people experience cramp-like leg pain walk relieve rest . This call intermittent claudication ( IC ) common symptom peripheral arterial disease . Patients IC struggle walk , turn lower quality life . The intensity IC pain experience walk depends several factor , include type footwear worn . For example , non-supportive shoe may make calf muscle work harder walking , lead earlier more-severe symptom IC . A member research team develop shoe reduces work do lower-leg muscle walk . Preliminary data indicate , wear `` unloading shoe '' , people IC able walk without pain compare wear normal pair shoe . The current project aim provide information usefulness acceptability shoe . Forty people IC complete set three walk test two separate occasion ; whilst wear unload shoe , whilst wear normal shoe . The participant give pair unload normal shoe wear two week , collect information acceptable shoe wear via survey participant one-to-one interview subset participant .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>York Study Unloading Shoes Vascular Intermittent Claudication</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design This single-centre , randomise crossover study qualitative component . Forty patient recruit York Hospital . Participants ask perform walk assessment two week day within maximum period two week . Participants randomly assign complete walking assessment whilst wear unloading shoe day 1 , follow walk assessment whilst wear control shoe day 2 , vice versa . All participant give unload control shoe wear two week , complete survey acceptable shoe wear . A sub-sample participant also interview acceptability shoe . Study set Recruitment study take place York Hospital , York , United Kingdom . Study assessment take place York St John University . Unloading shoe The design `` unloading '' shoe use research modern style trainer-type shoe cosmetically-shaped rocker sole incorporate . The rocker sole comprise three circular curve whose arc centre position anatomical ankle , hip knee respectively ; assume vertical low limb . This design influence line action ground reaction force pas close anatomical joint centre reduce moment need generated ambulation muscle act across joint low limb . Additionally design place ankle relatively plantarflexed position ankle plantarflexors use less energy instance place dorsiflexion . This order unload calf muscle provide simultaneous reduction ankle range motion relative plantarflexion still move near-normal trajectory . This also optimise lever arm Achilles tendon ankle joint make propulsion , therefore calf muscle power generation , efficient . Participants provide pair appropriately-sized shoe , produce study establish shoe manufacturer - Chaneco ( www.chaneco.co.uk ) . To allow participant habituate wearing shoe assessment , allow walk around shoe self-selected pace least 5 minute . Control shoe During control condition assessment , participant wear pair appropriately-sized shoe , similar appearance unloading shoe , contain alter sole . Again , provide Chaneco , minimum 5 minute walk allow habituation . Outcome measure Primary outcome measure • Maximum walk distance forced-pace walking : Following rest period least 20 minute , participant complete 6-minute walk test instruct walk far possible within 6 minute . This test simulate community walk good treadmill test , recommend primary outcome claudication trial , good inter-day reproducibility ( coefficient variation 10.4 % ) . A straight 30-m course use distance walk record . A test checklist standardise instruction use . The outcome assessor role size fitting shoe , attempt keep blind , verbal test instruction audio-recorded check consistency instruction deliver . Secondary outcome measure - Pain-free walking distance usual-pace walking : Following rest period least 20 minute , participant invite walk usual walk speed along straight 30-m course . Their walking speed record use electronic timing gate ( SMARTSPEED , Fusion Sport ) . Participants instructed indicate point first experience claudication pain . The distance walk point record . - Gait biomechanical parameter : Reflective marker position anatomical landmark low extremity use double-sided sticky tape allow 3D motion analysis . Wireless surface electromyography unit ( Trigno EMG , Delsys , Italy ) also attach skin overlie medial lateral Gastrocnemius Tibialis Anterior use double-sided sticky tape allow assessment lower-leg muscle recruitment pattern gait cycle . Participants walk usual pace along figure-of-8 circuit . A force plate ( 9281EA , Kistler ) position central straight portion figure-of-8 capture kinetic data . The participant naïve force plate , help ensure natural walk gait . Infra-red 3D optical motion analysis camera ( Oqus , Qualisys ) capture kinematic data time participant approach pass force plate . Participants indicate experience onset claudication pain continue pain prevents walk . Outcomes include step length , stride length , cadence , velocity joint angle , joint moment power low extremity three stage pain development walking ; pain-free walking , onset pain immediately stop walk due pain . Participant timeline Participants require attend biomechanics laboratory York St John University 3 occasion : first `` screen '' visit obtain write informed consent , confirm eligibility record baseline characteristic participant , two subsequent visit study assessment conduct . The study assessment session ( i.e . visit 2 3 ) identical composition apart participant wear different shoe ( unload control ) walking test . The first assessment visit must complete within 4 week screen visit , maximum 2 week minimum 1 day assessment visit 1 2 . After complete crossover study , half participant ( n=20 ) give unload shoe half ( n=20 ) control shoe wear 2 week . After 2-week period , participant complete return survey shoe question via telephone adverse device effect . A sub-sample ( minimum n=12 ; control n=6 , unload n=6 ) undertake telephone-based semi-structured interview qualitative researcher . This interview conduct within 2 week end 2 week shoe-wearing period . Therefore , maximum duration participant involve study point consent 10 week , minimum 17 day ; however , participant likely undertaking study visit across period 4-8 week .</detailed_description>
