	<detailed_description>Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome ( OSAS ) characterize repeat episode airway obstruction sleeping . The `` Apnea-hypopnea index '' ( AHI ) define event per hour , give information severity disease . The American Academy Sleep Medicine Task Force '' define 5 episode per hour strongly suspect OSAS disease . Upper airway obstruction sleep lead dramatic decrease oxygen saturation hypoxemia finally , consequence patient rapidly awake . The prevalence rise age 20 % population suspect sleep disorder . However 1-5 % male 0,5-2 % female age adult affect . Main reason obesity . Clinical sign sleepiness functional cognitive deficit . The Gold standard therapy `` continuous positive airway pressure '' ventilation sleep . However , success depend strongly patient´s compliance . Surgical treatment alternative option , could consider clinical success fail . It notable long-term mortality comparable medical treatment option . However , comparison cognitive function therapy yet analyze . The study address question treatment option favorable regard cognitive function outcome .</detailed_description>
