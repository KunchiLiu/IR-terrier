	<brief_summary>Background aim : Nucleos ( ) ide analogue may suppress HBV DNA undetectable level , 30-40 % remain sustained response 1-3 year discontinue therapy . The investigator try improve sustain response rate give course HBV vaccination last 6 month patient receive 3-year entecavir tenofovir therapy . Rational : The host may response HBV vaccine HBV DNA immune tolerance suppress entecavir tenofovir therapy . Patients : Patients receive entecavir tenofovir therapy least 30 month invite study . The case group receive 5 Engerix-B injection last 6 month entecavir tenofovir therapy . Arm A-entecavir pretreated group : 75 case enrol receive Engerix-B injection compare histological non-vaccine treat control ; Arm B-tenofovir pretreated group : 50 patient randomized case ( vaccine ) control group accord age , gender , pretreatment HBV DNA level . Therapy : Both case control group receive 3 year longer entecavir tenofovir therapy . Patients screen 24-30 month enrol 30 month entecavir tenofovir therapy . They receive 5 Engerix-B injection 0,1st ,2nd,3rd 6th month [ 30-36 +/-1 month post nucleos ( ) ide therapy ] post enrollment . Both drug discontinue complete therapy . Follow-up : Both group monitoring biochemistry , alpha-fetoprotein , quantitative HBsAg , HBV DNA level immunological parameter periodically 2 year therapy . Efficacy : Those patient persistent normal ALT HBV DNA low 1*100000 cps/mL discontinue nucleos ( ) ide analogue therapy consider sustained response . Patients transient elevation HBV DNA ALT , normalize spontaneously without therapy define delay response . Patients persistent HBV DNA great 1*100000 cps/mL consider non-sustained response . Study duration : The enrollment complete one year keep observation additional 2 year . Expected goal study : HBV vaccine nucleos ( ) ide analogues combination therapy may decrease HBV relapse rate 1 2 year complete therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Introduction Chronic hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) infection widely prevalent global health problem estimate 350-400 million chronic HBV carrier worldwide . In China , Southeast Asia sub-Saharan Africa , many 10-15 % population chronically infected HBV . In North America North Europe , HBV chronic carrier rate much low , usually 1 % . Intermediate HBV carrier rate 1-7 % find part Southern Eastern Europe , Central America , Middle East part Japan ( 1-4 ) . HBV highly infectious ; many chronic HBsAg carrier infect family shortly birth early childhood ( 5-7 ) . Recent genome-wide association study reveal antigen present molecule , Human leukocyte antigen-DP ( HLA-DP ) HLA-DQ , associate persistence HBV infection ( 8-10 ) . HBV actively replicate chronic carrier initial immune tolerance phase ( 11 ) . Impaired innate adaptive immune response HBV find stage ( 12-16 ) . They generally asymptomatic immune clearance phase develop . At stage , innate immunity , HBV-specific non-specific T cell immune cell may orchestra immune response hepatic necroinflammation clear HBV ( 17-19 ) . The immune clearance phase critical outcome chronic HBsAg carrier . Those patient prolong HBV replication repeat hepatic inflammation run liver cirrhosis /or hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) ( 20-23 ) . How terminate HBV replication important issue management chronic HBsAg carrier . 1.1 Therapy chronic hepatitis B In past 20 year , significant improvement treatment chronic hepatitis B ( CHB ) achieve introduce regimen interferon derivative nucleotide/nucleoside analogue ( NA ) ( 24-26 ) . Interferon T helper cell type 1 cytokine promotes immunity host clear HBV ( 27,28 ) . NA inhibit HBV DNA synthesis termination nascent proviral DNA chain . About 30 % patient may complete response normalization alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) HBV DNA low 10000 cps/mL one three year discontinue therapy ( 10,29-31 ) . For rest patient flare-up HBV replication occur ( 10,29-31 ) , life-long therapy may need eliminate covalently close circular DNA ( cccDNA ) pool achieve sustained therapeutic response ( 32 ) . Unfortunately , prolong use NA need lot budget carry substantial risk emerge drug resistance mutant ( 33 ) . The interferon derivative regimens similar efficacy significant side effect ( 27,28 ) . Therefore , Development safe affordable anti-HBV agent/strategy need improve outcome ( 34 ) . 1.2 Rational combine HBV vaccine NA therapy NA therapy may suppress Serum HBV DNA undetectable level ( 29-31 ) . These drug acceptable patient admit orally , daily without significant side effect . The main problem HBV DNA tend relapse approximately 70 % patient 1-3 year discontinue therapy ( 10 , 29-31 ) . When HBV suppress NA therapy , immune tolerance may also suppress . The post treatment relapse indirect evidence lose immune tolerance patient ( 29-31 ) . The post treatment clinical relapse associate enhance Th1 response ( 35-37 ) . T regulatory ( Treg ) cell , macrophage unidentified factor may play important role HBV tolerance ( 19 , 38-41 ) . One important phenomenon patient receive NA therapy decrease Treg cell level ( 42,43 ) . The post treatment relapse hepatic necroinflammation evidence restore HBV specific immune response ( 44,45 ) . In addition relief immune tolerance , NA may suppress HBsAg production free virus , effect expect HBsAg produce integrated HBV genome . These two type HBsAg may differences protein conformation behavior ( 46,47 ) . The vaccine produce accord free virus . Therefore , HBsAg produce free virus suppress NA low level , vaccine may recognize new antigen . The immune response elicit therapeutic vaccine may potential suppression free virus . 1.3 Combined HBV vaccine NA therapy animal study A Woodchuck animal study suggest entecavir therapy follow Woodchuck surface ( WHs ) core ( WHc ) DNA vaccination 7 week later may induce WHc WHs specific T cell response . Two 6 animal clear Woodchuck surface antigen ( WHBsAg ) product anti-WHBs ( 48 ) . Similar result find HBV transgenic mouse model . Hepatitis B surface ( HBs ) hepatitis B core ( HBc ) specific cellular humoral response identify HBc HBs protein vaccine therapy ( 49 ) . In mouse model sustain HBV viremia infection recombinant adeno-associated virus carry replicable HBV genome . Immunization conventional HBV vaccine presence aluminum adjuvant fail elicit immune response , vaccination mouse HBsAg/CpG induce strong antibody production T-cell response ( 50 ) 1.4 Combined HBV vaccine NA therapy liver transplantation Prevention HBV reinfection important issue chronic hepatitis B receive liver transplantation . HBsAg immunoglobulin ( HBIG ) choice therapy evident good protection ( 51 ) . However , HBIG quite expensive long term therapy need . Combination HBV vaccine NA therapy do patient receive liver transplantation . The initial report good ( 52-54 ) , recent study suggest 50 % patient response lamivudine HBV vaccination combination therapy ( 55,56 ) adjust dose HBIG . All study report severe adverse event use lamivudine HBV vaccine combination therapy . 1.5 Combined HBV vaccine NA therapy patient chronic hepatitis B To increase response rate many HBV vaccine develop increase immune epitope posttranslation modification ( 57,58 ) Combination Lamivudine therapeutic HBsAg DNA vaccination lead persistence T-cell response ( 59 ) . An HBV therapeutic vaccine clinical trial study show decrease HBV replication hepatitis B e antigen ( HBeAg ) positive patient receive HBV vaccine lamivudine combination therapy ( 60 ) . 2 . Study objectives To understand efficacy combine 3-year NA Engerix-B therapy sustain viral suppression . 3 . Investigational plan 3.1 Overall study design This trial examine efficacy NA Engerix-B combination therapy chronic hepatitis B . 3.2 Study design Arm A-entecavir pretreated group : Case vs. histological control study . Arm B-tenofovir pretreated group : randomized case control study . 3.3 . Therapy 3.3.1 Entecavir 0.5 mg daily least 3 year . 3.3.2 Tenofovir 300 mg daily least 3 year . 3.3.3 Five dos Engerix-B 20 ug last 6 month NA therapy case group . Both case control group complete 3-year NA therapy . The vaccination group receive course Engerix-B vaccination . They enrol last 6 month NA therapy . Engerix-B give 0,1st ,2nd 3rd 6th month enrollment .</detailed_description>
