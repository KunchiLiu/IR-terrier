	<brief_summary>Maintaining muscle mass function important healthy age maintain quality life . Loss muscle mass major problem , beyond age ~50 , muscle mass decline ~1-2 % year . To prevent loss , investigator need understand mechanism regulate muscle mass age . In project investigator aim determine mechanism use new technique heavy water ingestion , allow measurement multiple aspect skeletal muscle mass metabolism e.g . protein synthesis , long period ( 6 week ) people go normal everyday activity . The investigator also aim determine influence resistance exercise training old muscle , well difference men woman muscle response exercise nutrition HMB ( beta-hydroxy-beta-methylbutyrate ) .</brief_summary>
