	<brief_summary>In geriatric department , physician face two difficulty , first increase number infection cause multiresistant bacteria , especially extended spectrum β-lactamase ( ESBL ) produce enterobacteria strain second , poor venous access frequently encounter elderly population . Giving antibiotic subcutaneously would interest alternative , intramuscular injection contraindicate case anticoagulant therapy . Unfortunately , data available subcutaneous ( SC ) administration . Ertapenem recent long-acting parenteral carbapenem indicate especially treatment ESBL infection . Its subcutaneously administration test several study Intensive Care Units ( ICU ) internal medicine ward promise result regard clinical pharmacokinetics data . An alternative IV Ertapenem administration need poor venous access behavioural abnormality commonly present infect elderly population . Ertapenem currently SC administrate geriatric department option available . Moreover elderly patient often present several comorbdities , polymedication , renal insufficiency , cachexia may disturb antibiotic pharmacokinetics . The aim study obtain pharmacokinetic data SC IV Ertapenem administration elderly population , obtain PK/PD parameter adapt time-dependent antibiotic ( T % &gt; MIC ) descriptive data occurrence adverse effect evolution sign infection .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>ESBL infection incidence increase especially elderly population ( Observatoire National de l'Epidémiologie de la Résistance Bactérienne aux Antibiotiques ( ONERBA ) www.onerba.org ) . SC antibiotic route sometimes option available infected elderly patient ( delirium , dementia venous access ) present advantage like great patient comfort , less nursing time decrease hospital duration . Ertapenem relatively long half life ( 4 hour ) compare imipenem ( 1 hour ) less broad spectrum . Two study compare ertapenem pharmacokinetics regard IV SC administration . The first concerned 6 patient admitted ICU second 16 patient internal medicine department . They find IV SC administration equivalent consider ertapenem antimicrobial activity time dependent . In fact , reduction peak concentration time peak concentration observe study , Area Under Curve similar especially time spent Minimal Inhibitory Concentration . Both study observe severe adverse effect . Because promise result despite approved yet , SC Ertapenem , commonly use geriatric department . This administration route choose option available , instance case behavioural disturbance lack venous access . The objective investigator study confirm pharmacokinetics data elderly population know present frequently renal insufficiency denutrition document occurrence adverse effect clinical evolution . Patients 75 receive ertapenem 48 hour ( IV SC ) include . Ertapenem concentration ( H0 , H+0.5h H+2.5h ) determine steady state describe base administration route . Systemic local adverse effect collect treatment infection evolution describe . Patients monitor ertapenem treatment 45 day begin treatment . Biological data obtain initially inclusion ( D3 ertapenem begin ) 14 day ( +/-10 ) begin treatment ( corresponding end treatment ) . Signs infection evolution also monitor 45 day ( +/-10 ) .</detailed_description>
