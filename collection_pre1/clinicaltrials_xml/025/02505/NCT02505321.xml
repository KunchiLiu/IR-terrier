	<brief_summary>The adipose ( fat ) cell skin individual store excess fat . The excess fat , `` strain '' put cell get big n't work well . Having fat skin important . People genetic defect result almost fat skin high risk condition call insulin resistance ( body respond well insulin blood sugar level rise ) . This lead diabetes heart disease despite overweight . Scientists recently start understand importance fat insulin resistance people unable store fat well insulin resistance despite obese . The investigator also recently discover small change person 's genetic code ( body 's instruction manual ) may also affect ability store fat would like explore detail . To , recruit volunteer Exeter 10,000 study give permission contact research . The investigator collect detail body size measure blood sample take special drink high fat ( similar thick milk shake ) , compare result people without particular genetic change interest . Knowing genetic change fat cell work could help improve understand people develop diabetes heart disease despite relatively normal BMI .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hypothesis : Individuals carry different genetic variation different ability store fat skin . Aim : To improve understand `` adipose tissue dysfunction '' use human genetics , demonstrate lipid uptake fat cell compromise subject 'polygenetic lipodystrophy ' allele . Objectives : - Identify individual genetic risk variant interest control match gender , age BMI . - Undertake detailed physiological assessment include Oral Triglyceride Tolerance Test ( OTTT ) ( blood sample fatty drink ) , detail body size measure optional fat biopsy . - Using sample collect , test whether individual carry high genetic load `` polygenic lipodystrophy '' allele : 1. large subcutaneous fat cell . 2. high circulate lipid level 4 hour fatty meal challenge . 3. gene expression profile normally associate obesity , despite BMI match control . This profile include downregulation gene involve fatty acid traffic upregulation gene involve inflammation . 4. high insulin resistance measure HOMAIR ( calculate fast insulin fast glucose ) . Background : Diabetes common chronic metabolic disease major source morbidity mortality . It one big healthcare challenge face UK NHS 2.6 million adult diagnosed UK , vast majority ( 90 % ) type 2 Diabetes ( T2D ) . It anticipate number continue rise , part due increase level obesity population . T2D characterise high blood glucose level context increase insulin resistance reduce beta cell function , develop several year individual unaware problem . Research group Exeter lead effort identify genetic factor influence people develop T2D despite relative leanness , whilst many obese people get disease . The investigator identify many factor wish study detail understand role insulin . Introduction : Adipose tissue dysfunction Working collaborator part ongoing genetic study , investigator identify several genetic variation ( DNA change ) associate insulin resistance , believe genetic variant operate primarily adipose tissue `` dysfunction '' . Adipose tissue dysfunction relatively new concept result detailed physiological study reveal obese individual large fat cell , inflame fat tissue ( often infiltrate macrophage ) poorer adipose tissue blood flow pre/post meal , differential expression gene involve process ( Alkhouli 2013 ) . The failure adipocytes , result limited capacity take free fatty acid ( FFA ) , predispose ectopic fat deposition deposition lipid sit liver , muscle omental tissue similar subject lipodystrophy . The investigator try understand genetic variation cause differences people 's ability store fat wish test hypothesis individual carry different genetic variation different ability store fat skin subcutaneous fat tissue . This could lead improve understanding subcutaneous fat storage . It unlikely rise number people become overweight obese age substantially reverse , therefore study 's finding could important identify reduce risk disease cause obesity . Methods : Study design : This prospective `` recruit genotype '' cohort study take place 2 year period ( 2015 2017 ) . Study participant : All participant identify exist research cohort manage NIHR Exeter Clinical Research Facility ( Exeter CRF ) recruitment facilitate within Exeter CRF . Under over-arching ethical approval 09/H0106/75 , approximately 7500 anonymised DNA sample genotyped genetic variant related insulin production . These variant occur &gt; 1 % population direct consequence individual health . There defined cut-off , , polygenic lipodystrophy base single genetic variant . People 0 22 polygenic lipodystrophy allele investigator look combination least 11 genetic variant . They identify approx 300 people EXTEND cohort fit criterion recruit match control EXTEND cohort identify few number risk allele . Recruitment : The investigator provide Exeter Clinical Research Facility ( Exeter CRF ) list sample number identify Individuals identify `` polygenic lipodystrophy '' genetic variant interest , together control individual carry average number risk allele . The Exeter CRF Data Manager identify 50 individual variant 50 individual match age , gender , diabetes status BMI , invite 5-hour visit Exeter CRF data sample collection . Interested participant contact directly member study team responsible recruitment process , provide detailed verbal write project-specific information . Procedure : All participant ask refrain strenuous exercise eat fatty meal 48 hour prior come clinic , alcohol ( high energy content affect liver ) otherwise normal diet , fast overnight prior attend morning visit Exeter CRF . Participants ask sign write consent form prior data collection . Data collection : Anthropometry : - Baseline data include Ht ( ) , Wt ( kg ) , Waist ( cm ) Hip ( cm ) circumference record . - Detailed body fat measure obtain BOD POD . - Skin fold measurement ( mm ) biceps , triceps , subscapular , suprailiac region . Medical history : include current medication lifestyle information ( smoking/alcohol ) . BODPOD TM : Detailed body composition measure obtain use Body Composition Tracking System . This briefly comprise BOD POD machine , electronic scale , computer . It use principle body densitometry ( measure mass volume ) calculate participant 's percentage absolute amount fat fat free mass . Participants ask wear minimal clothing ( e.g . swim costume ) close fit swim hat . They stand electric scale record weight calibrate BOD POD . Participants ask sit inside BOD POD 1 minute time ( max 3 time ) . The computer analyse generate result . Blood sample : Oral Triglyceride Tolerance Test ( OTTT ) ( approx . 4 hour ) : A small cannula ( thin plastic tube ) insert vein follow standard clinical practice minimize potential trauma repeat blood sampling . - Fasting sample ( -5 -2 minute ) obtain baseline measure ( include routine glucose lipid measurement ) plasma serum storage future batch analysis , pre-OTTT measure glucose , insulin , standard lipid , store plasma potential future metabolomic lipidomic study . - Following initial fast blood sampling , participant ask drink approx 150 ml Fresubin 5cal shot supplement drink 5 min period . The time completion note T= 0 . Further blood sample obtain T=30 , 60 , 120 , 180 240 minute post-ingestion . The calorific content proportion macronutrients Fresubin similar describe publication perform OTTT ( Karamanos 2001 ; Carstensen 2003 ; Mohanlal 2004 ) . At end period cannula remove participant offer light lunch/refreshments . Optional abdominal fat biopsy ( approx . 30 min undertaken OTTT ) : For research volunteer happy undergo small fat biopsy , sample abdominal fat obtain firstly inject local anaesthetic accessible area abdomen . Using scalpel , small incision ( approx 2-3 cm ) make depth approx 15mm two small pea-sized sample fat remove . The wound close simple suture steristrips . One fat sample flash frozen liquid nitrogen immediately excision store minus 80 degree RNA analysis . The sample store formalin later immunohistochemistry stain .</detailed_description>
