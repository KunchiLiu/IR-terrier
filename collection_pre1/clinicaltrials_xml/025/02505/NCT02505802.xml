	<brief_summary>Botulinum toxin A ( BoNT-A ) injection widely use treat spasticity stroke . Although treatment effective muscle tone improvement , effect gait ability daily live early stage stroke adult remain uncertain.The purpose study determine whether early calf muscle injection low dose BoNT-A severely affect patient within 6 week stroke could help hold back disable muscle spasticity improve walk dysfunction .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Effectiveness Early Botulinum Toxin A Injection Lower Limbs Spasticity Subacute Stroke Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The high prevalence stroke global problem cause well-known long-term disability . Post-stroke lower-extremity spasticity may cause severe functional limitation pain . Spasticity phenomenon define disordered sensory-motor control , result upper motor neuron ( UMN ) lesion , present intermittent sustain involuntary activation muscle . Spasticity may interfere motor function , common reason clinical intervention physiotherapy , use orthoses technical device drug . Botulinum toxin A ( BoNT-A ) potent neurotoxin produce bacterium clostridium botulinum . BoNT-A , block acetylcholine release neuromuscular junction , account therapeutic action relieve dystonia , spasticity , related disorder . Unfortunately , intramuscular injection botulinum often carried patient obvious spasticity . It normally give clinical sign elevate muscle tone become establish ; therefore usually give least three month stroke , . It impede rehabilitation patient . Accordingly , present study ask whether early calf muscle injection low dose BoNT-A severely affect patient within 6 week stroke could help hold back disable muscle spasticity improve walk dysfunction along 24 week fellow trail . This randomized , open-label , controlled trial along 24-weeks trail . Referred sample adult subacute stroke patient ( within 6 week since stroke , n=30 ) mild spasticity calf muscle include . Patients randomly allocate BoNT-A treatment group ( 15 patient ) control group ( 15 patient ) . In BoNT-A treatment group patient receive 200 unit BoNT-A injection triceps surae ( 150iu ) tibial muscle posterior ( 50iu ) . No special treatment perform control group . Both group receive comprehensive rehabilitation 8 week . Lower limbs Fugl-Meyer ( FM ) score , calf muscle modify Ashworth scale ass ( MAS ) , gastrocnemius surface electromyography ( sEMG ) evaluation modify Barthel index ( MBI ) assess 8 , 12 , 24 week treatment . Gait analysis ( step length，cadence，speed ) , 6-min walking distance assess 8 , 12 , 24 week injection .</detailed_description>
