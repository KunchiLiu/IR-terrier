	<brief_summary>Carpal tunnel syndrome expensive upper extremity work-related musculoskeletal disorder , impact 10 million people annually cost employer $ 113,695 per incident . There currently establish method detect disorder prior onset symptom nerve damage . Preliminary research suggest sonography—a relatively inexpensive , widely available , increasingly portable technology—can provide non-invasive pain-free method early detection could reduce incidence , improve target intervention ultimately reduce cost . The primary aim study establish predictive validity novel method early detection use sonographic image identify task component intensive functional hand activity associate morphologic change .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This longitudinal study follow dental hygiene students—a high-risk population minimal retrospective control prospective task exposure—for two year compare non-exposed cohort occupational therapy student investigate primary aim . This research direct National Occupational Research Agenda 's ( NORA ) Healthcare Social Assistance sector focus National Institute Occupational Safety Health 's ( NIOSH ) Exposure Assessment Musculoskeletal Disorders cross-sectors . Intermediate outcomes research establish sonographic image early detection tool workplace-screening inform method combine measure nerve morphology , neurophysiology , subjective symptom predict development work-related carpal tunnel syndrome . This work also inform development target preventive intervention task component intensive hand activity relate change tissue morphology . Identifying morphologic change early-stages pathology specific task component link change first step toward early detection prevention work-related carpal tunnel syndrome .</detailed_description>
