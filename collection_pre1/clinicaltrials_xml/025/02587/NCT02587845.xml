	<brief_summary>Studies show tranexamic acid reduces blood loss transfusion need patient undergoing total hip arthroplasty . However , date , study large enough determine definitively whether drug safe effective . The present study design verify noninferior efficacy safety topical intra-articular TXA compare intravenous TXA primary THA .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Treatment choice osteoarthritis hip , developmental dysplasia hip , osteonecrosis femoral head old patient . In association investigator age society , number patient need THA may increase significantly next year [ 1 ] . However , THA , considerable blood loss remain major problem , lead need allogeneic blood transfusion . Such transfusion allogeneic erythrocytes free adverse event associate transmission infectious disease , increase postoperative bacterial infection , immune sensitization , transfusion-related acute lung injury , intravascular hemolysis , transfusion-induced coagulopathy , renal failure , admission intensive care , even death . Several effective intervention develop reduce blood loss postoperative transfusion rate , preoperative autologous donation , cell salvage , control hypotension , regional anesthesia , use erythropoietin antifibrinolytics . The antifibrinolytics include aprotinin , tranexamic acid ( TXA ) , Îµ-aminocaproic acid , different mechanism action [ 8 ] . TXA synthetic derivative amino acid lysine competitive inhibitor plasminogen activation , thus interfere fibrinolysis . Compared antifibrinolytic drug , TXA cheap safer aprotinin potent others . Numerous study evaluate use antifibrinolytics orthopedic surgery show effective reduce blood loss . However , available clinical trial meta-analyses lack sufficient statistical power determine effectiveness antifibrinolytic agent total hip arthroplasty .</detailed_description>
