	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND : A high-fat , high-carbohydrate meal ( HFHC ) induce increase inflammation peripheral-blood mononuclear cell healthy subject . A study show orange juice , consume together high-fat meal , able revert increase inflammatory marker . OBJECTIVES : To study effect single HFHC meal take water , orange juice ( 500ml ) isocaloric glucose drink protein expression peripheral blood mononuclear cell healthy individual . DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY : Twelve healthy , normal weight individual consume HFHC meal water , water glucose orange juice cross-over design least one week interval meal . Blood sample collect , 1 , 3 5h meal . Blood glucose , insulin lipid profile measure . Also , proteome analysis use TMT label perform peripheral-blood mononuclear cell collect time 3 5h meal .</detailed_description>
