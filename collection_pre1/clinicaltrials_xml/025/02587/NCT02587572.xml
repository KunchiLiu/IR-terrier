	<detailed_description>This randomize , placebo-controlled clinical trial design evaluate safety efficacy Longeveron Mesenchymal Stem Cells ( LMSCs ) subject metabolic syndrome ass effect LMSCs endothelial function use several different dos . Following successful run-in phase , total forty ( 40 ) subject randomize ( 1:1:1:1 ) receive one three different dos LMSCs placebo . After randomization , baseline imaging , test study product infusion , subject follow 24 hour , month 1 , month 3 , month 6 , month 9 month 12 post study product infusion . All endpoint assess 3 , 6 12 month visit occur 90±30 day , 180±30 day , 365±30 day respectively day study product infusion ( Day 1 ) . For purpose endpoint analysis safety evaluation , `` intent-to-treat '' study population utilize .</detailed_description>
