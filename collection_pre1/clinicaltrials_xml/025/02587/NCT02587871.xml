	<brief_summary>This phase II trial study well donor cellular therapy cytarabine work treat patient intermediate-risk acute myeloid leukemia decrease disappearance sign symptom cancer . Donor cellular therapy short-term transfusion cell family member incompletely match . The use partially match white blood cell may help improve response standard chemotherapy ( cytarabine ) reduce risk infection , without permanent transplant . Drugs use chemotherapy , cytarabine , work different way stop growth cancer cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Giving donor cellular therapy cytarabine may kill cancer cell .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Donor Cellular Therapy After Cytarabine Treating Patients With Intermediate-Risk Acute Myeloid Leukemia Remission</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess 2-year disease-free survival ( defined time death cause disease relapse , whichever early ) patient &lt; 60 year age intermediate-risk acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) , complete remission ( CR ) induction chemotherapy , receive microtransplantation , compare patient receive consolidation chemotherapy historical publish comparable cohort patient . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To obtain estimate rate relapse , treatment related mortality ( TRM ) , cause mortality , microtransplantation ( MST ) group compare allogeneic stem cell group ( historical cohort ) . II . To obtain estimate rate acute graft-versus-host disease ( GVHD ) , chronic GVHD , time recovery absolute neutrophil count platelets patient intermediate risk AML receive chemotherapy combination microtransplantation . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Presence absence detectable donor chimerism post-microtransplantation 6 month last infusion . II . Characteristics infused cell composition graft . III . Dynamics T-cell clonality . IV . Immune cell subset analysis . OUTLINE : Approximately 4-6 week completion induction chemotherapy , patient receive cytarabine intravenously ( IV ) 1-3 hour twice daily ( BID ) day -7 -2 granulocyte colony stimulate factor ( G-CSF ) mobilize peripheral blood cell ( microtransplant ) IV 15-20 minute day 0 . Treatment repeat every 8-10 week 3 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow least every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
