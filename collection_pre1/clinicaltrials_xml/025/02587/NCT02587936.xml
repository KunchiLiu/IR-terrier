	<detailed_description>ICD-Pieces randomize , pragmatic clinical trial four large healthcare system improve care patient coexistent CKD , diabetes hypertension . The investigator hypothesis patient receive care collaborative model primary care-subspecialty care enhance novel information technology ( Pieces ) practice facilitator few all-cause hospitalization , readmission , disease-specific hospitalization , ER visit , cardiovascular event deaths patient receive standard medical care . The investigator also aim develop well understand risk predictor patient CKD , diabetes hypertension guide future recommendation therapy tailor individual patient . The primary objective study test hypothesis collaborative model primary care enhance novel information technology practice facilitator allow leverage data electronic health record identify patient triad CKD , diabetes hypertension use objective reproducible criterion , provide clinician support implementation best practice care , monitor clinical measure , adjust treatment reduce 12-month hospitalization rate . In study disease-specific hospitalization CKD , diabetes hypertension include hospitalization due cardiovascular complication , congestive heart failure , volume overload , accelerated/malignant/uncontrolled hypertension , acute coronary syndrome , myocardial infarction , stroke , coronary/peripheral revascularization , limb ischemia/amputations , diabetes complication , uncontrolled diabetes , hypoglycemia , acute kidney injury , hyperkalemia , electrolyte disturbance , medication error , drug toxicity , infection . Secondary Objectives : The study test implementation collaborative model primary care-subspecialty care intervention reduce 30-day readmission ( patient hospitalize ) , emergency room visit , cardiovascular event , death disease-specific hospitalization . In study disease-specific hospitalization CKD , diabetes hypertension include hospitalization due cardiovascular complication , congestive heart failure , volume overload , accelerated/malignant/uncontrolled hypertension , acute coronary syndrome , myocardial infarction , stroke , coronary/peripheral revascularization , limb ischemia/amputations , diabetes complication , uncontrolled diabetes , hypoglycemia , acute kidney injury , hyperkalemia , electrolyte disturbance , medication error , drug toxicity , infection . 2 . ) Develop validate predictive model risk hospitalization , emergency room visit , cardio vascular event deaths patient coexistent CKD , diabetes hypertension predict risk 30-day disease-specific readmission patient hospitalize . 3 . ) Capture data ( demographic , clinical , medication , laboratory , procedure ) phenotype patient triad CKD , diabetes hypertension . 4 . ) Obtain important safety data patient CKD , diabetes hypertension include adverse safety event , acute kidney injury progression chronic kidney disease ( even patient hospitalize ) . 5 . ) Obtain information resource utilization include hospitalization also emergency room visit , outpatient visit diagnostic therapeutic procedure . 6 . ) Evaluate impact collaboratory model care patient Reported Outcomes ( PROs ) include health-related quality life , patient satisfaction , Patient perspective quality care measure patient perception burden relate care CKD , diabetes hypertension . 7 . ) Evaluate impact collaborative primary care-subspecialty care model provider satisfaction resource ability manage patient coexistent CKD , diabetes hypertension . Study Outcome Measures : The primary outcome trial cause hospitalization patient triad CKD , diabetes hypertension . Specifically , outcome hospitalization rate 12 month study participant . The investigator include regular hospitalization define Center Medicaid Medicare ( CMS ) observation status overnight ( avoid variation related definition inpatient status/hospitalization use recent implementation `` two midnight rule '' CMS-1599-F ) . Study Design : The study employ prospective stratified cluster randomization design . The stratum four large healthcare system participate study . The unit randomization primary care clinic . In healthcare system several primary care clinic share geographic location personnel randomize single unit . The cluster design study best suit detect important difference outcomes intervention control group [ 8,55 ] . The decision use primary care clinic unit randomization study base ability implement different model care active intervention site compare control sit . The collaborative model care include novel information technology , subject identification , facilitation patient care , monitor outcome participation facilitator efficiently apply workflow clinic fully randomize active intervention . The cluster randomization design clinic receive collaborative primary care-subspecialty care versus standard care also limit risk cross-contamination intervention control group study Primary care practice stratify healthcare system randomly allocate either intervention group standard medical care group use randomize permutation block within stratum . Based assignment clinic patient go , patient assign either intervention group standard medical care group . All eligible patient clinic randomize study include comparison two intervention group regardless intervention compliance ( intention-to-treat analysis ) investigate patient intervention group significantly less all-cause hospitalization standard medical care group . Evaluation also perform determine treatment effect disease-specific hospitalization , ER visit , cardiovascular event death . There two study group : active intervention group randomize collaborative model care facilitate novel information technology practice facilitator standard/usual care group . The intervention active group implementation collaborative model care facilitate deliver best care practice patient coexistent CKD , type 2 diabetes hypertension . The model use novel information technology platform call Pieces practice facilitator purpose allow early identification patient objective criterion implement best practice care , monitor important clinical measure , adjust treatment achieve improve outcome . The intervention deliver outpatient setting . Data collection assessment study objectives mainly base information technology tool capture data electronic health record . Some data field require collection data Dallas Fort Worth Regional Hospital Council , ProHealth ACO databases , VA North Texas Social Security Death Files Index . A Data Safety Monitoring Board ( DSMB ) assemble National Institute Diabetes Digestive Kidney Diseases ( NIDDK ) oversee study plan implementation study .</detailed_description>
