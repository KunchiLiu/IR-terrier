	<brief_summary>Peripheral chemoreceptor baroreceptor locate close proximity carotid artery wall level carotid bifurcation . Baroreceptor stimulation lower sympathetic activity blood pressure . In contrast , chemoreceptor stimulation raise sympathetic activity blood pressure . Thus , beneficial effect electrical carotid sinus stimulation blood pressure could diminish chemoreceptor overactivity and/or concomitant chemoreceptor activation device . Therefore , study ass baroreflex/chemoreflex interaction patient resistant hypertension equip carotid sinus stimulators . The study inform u potential additional anti-hypertensive benefit simultaneous chemoreceptor denervation electrode placement . Furthermore , result may provide information suitable electrode design spare co-activation peripheral chemoreceptor . Taken together , study help develop strategy improve responder rate efficacy carotid sinus stimulators patient resistant hypertension .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients implanted device electrical baroreflex stimulation recruit accord inclusion exclusion criterion good quality recording obtain 10 maximally 15 patient . After obtain write informed consent patient investigate laboratory one day . In 20 % patient may fail find appropriate nerve record position . In case ask patient repeat experiment . Patients investigate post-absorptive state empty bladder . During instrumentation measurement rest supine position . We fix chest electrode ECG impedance cardiography . A peripheral venous catheter introduce later dopamine infusion . Cuffs use upper arm finger order monitor blood pressure allow pulse-contour analysis . Finally , search suitable nerve record position peroneal nerve recording muscle sympathetic nerve activity ( MSNA , postganglionic vasoconstrictor sympathetic drive ) . All bioelectric signal record continuously duration experiment . After preparation baseline recording perform . Subsequently , electrical baroreflex stimulator switch OFF ON repeatedly ( toggle ) normoxic condition . Every OFF ON state last 4 minute . Oscillometric blood-pressure reading take every two minute acquire two reading per stimulation period . Toggling normoxia meant ensure patient responder experimental day rule blood pressure rise high stimulation ( safety concern ) . Afterwards , breathe gas change order patient inhale hypoxic hyperoxic mixture blind manner . After reach stable ventilatory autonomic state , stimulator toggle blood-pressure measurement repeat . The procedure take place establish opposite oxygenation state . Stimulation ON oxygen state imply first switch OFF switch oxygenation condition . Afterwards , last oxygenation state maintain additional low-dose dopamine infusion apply . Again , electrical baroreflex stimulator switch repeatedly blood-pressure reading take . During last two stimulator toggle state oxygenation level , venous blood sample draw hormone measurement inert gas rebreathing take place cardiac output determination . Finally , correct position microneurography electrode check . The duration experiment depend time need find sympathetic nerve bundle measurement experiment , case record position get lose . However , experiment rarely exceed 5 hour total .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Implanted device electrical baroreflex stimulation . The patient 'responder ' , i. e. carotidsinus stimulation cause drop systolic arterial pressure least 15 mmHg . The patient give inform consent . The patient investigator subinvestigator , research assistant , pharmacist , study coordinator , staff relative thereof directly involve conduct protocol . The mental condition render patient unable understand nature , scope , possible consequence study . The patient unlikely comply protocol . The patient pregnant breastfeeding . Hypoxic condition half hour consider harmful , e. g. patient shunt . History drug alcohol abuse . Discontinuation diuretic medication one day consider harmful . ( Reason : Bladder distension sympathoexcitatory stimulus shorten experimental time . In order prevent shortcoming three measure take : Dispensation beverage diuretic well complete bladder void immediately experiment . )</criteria>
