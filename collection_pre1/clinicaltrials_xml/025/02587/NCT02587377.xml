	<brief_summary>The availability sensitive specific fungal biomarkers could precious help improve management patient suffer fungal disease , allow preemptive treatment , also offer objective element assess patient therapeutic response prognosis . The use biomarkers could also contribute accurately evaluate novel antifungal drug effectiveness serve valuable tool guide decision regard ineffective treatment dose selection product development . Using two three test may increase sensitivity detect IFI . The result serum assay correlate definition 'proven ' fungal infection define EORTC/MSG criterion publish 2008 . Based upon result adult ' study , investigator estimate galactomannan antigen 1 , 3 Î²-D glucan could reasonably 90 % sensitivity ( 95 % CI 73 % 98 % ) current design . As concern aspergillus fumigatus PCR , sensitivity specificity could estimate 63 % 100 % 87 % 96.7 % , respectively .</brief_summary>
