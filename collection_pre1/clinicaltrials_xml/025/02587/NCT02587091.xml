	<brief_title>Effectiveness Advertising Availability Prenatal Ultrasound Uptake Antenatal Care Rural Uganda</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study Design We conduct non-blinded cluster-randomized control trial evaluate effectiveness advertising prenatal portable obstetric ultrasound ( pOBU ) uptake antenatal care ( ANC ) service . This study design select mitigate confound variable use natural landscape region ( describe ) , conveniently divide geographically isolated otherwise homogenous sub-counties , advantage . The study conduct Kabale District , rural highland locate southwestern Uganda . It roughly 560 km capital city Kampala population approximately 522,000 . It divide three region - north , central south , subdivide 22 sub-counties , 11 North , four centrally seven South . Ethics approval obtain Lakeridge Health Corporation city Oshawa , Canada well Mbarara University Science Technology ( MUST ) Mbarara , Uganda . The study protocol find follow link : http : //bridgetohealth.ca/study-protocol/ Study Population All sub-counties southern northern region Kabale district eligible inclusion cluster study . This population predominantly engage subsistence agriculture . There limited data describe healthcare rural isolated region , believe government statistic often inaccurate . The Ugandan Ministry Health , numerous non governmental organization ( NGOs ) faith-based organization provide region ' healthcare . Data suggest uptake ANC service close 66 % , one third woman return fourth visit deliver healthcare facility ( HCF ) . All woman currently aware pregnant present ANC eligible inclusion study . No pregnant woman present clinic exclude study . All patient provide write informed consent form develop collaboration MUST ethic board . Many patient illiterate unable read consent form write English . A bilingual Ugandan midwife , translate consent form verbally explain content patient check clinic . It clearly state patient chose engage research study would still receive full ANC care . Randomisation Masking Twenty-two sub-counties assessed inclusion , 18 randomise intervention ( n=4 ) control group ( n=4 ) . The four sub-counties central region intentionally exclude study design primarily compose urban sub-urban community effectively divide northern southern region . Four control site ( sub-counties ) randomly select southern wing four intervention site randomly select northern wing . Selection northern versus southern county intervention control group , well selection subcounties within region order would visit selected random . Random selection conduct statistician MUST use simple random number program MS-Excel . All eight sub-counties control treatment arm receive advertisement word mouth ( WOM ) regard ANC . The control arm receive advertisement pOBU . When consent obtain control arm intentional masking pOBU . Following completion initial consent entrance survey woman provide debrief form explain presence ultrasound , include community advertise , consent obtain participate research study . Any woman choose engage research study provide complete ANC service , include pOBU . Communities randomly select state receive messaging pOBU . However , control community choose visit en bloc first four day , oppose alternate control intervention day . This do specifically avoid contamination radio message pOBU , felt possibly cross geographic boundary . Sunday intentionally avoid study day patient population ascribe Catholic faith would attend clinic held particular day . Intervention The intervention advertising availability clinic pOBU cluster level ( sub-county ) . The initial study design two group describe randomisation . However , protocol amend study due interim analysis result demonstrate WOM advertising pOBU successful increase uptake ANC . It hypothesize population unable spread message many know pOBU , therefore could relay message . The intervention arm subsequently modify include radio advertising message could deliver clearly directly . This result follow three distinct intervention group : WOM advertisement pOBU ANC ( Intervention A ) , WOM advertisement pOBU WOM + radio advertisement ANC ( Intervention B ) , WOM + radio advertisement pOBU ANC ( Intervention C ) . The radio message Intervention C include word `` You able see picture baby '' . All woman attend clinic offer pOBU deliver certified Ugandan ultrasound technician use single Nanomaxx unit C60n/8-5 MHz ( 11-mm broadband curve array ) probe . Patients rotate ANC clinic base WHO guideline high quality ANC5 well WHO four-pronged approach elimination mother child transmission HIV ( EMTCT ) . Women receive pre- post-test counseling rapid test HIV . Those positive enrolled National HIV program start antiretroviral therapy per national guideline . Women also offer intermittent presumptive therapy malaria , rapid treponemal test treatment syphilis , hepatitis B screen syndromic management sexually transmit infection . Iron folate supplementation provide woman . Any woman active labour critically low hemoglobin transport hospital ambulance . Any woman abnormal finding ultrasound refer obstetric specialty follow . All woman encourage deliver local HCF . Survey Women question regard experience attitude towards ANC intention utilize HFC entrance ( debriefed regard availability ultrasound ) receive pOBU result . This perform assistance bilingual Ugandan midwife . Data collect use standardized electronic patient entrance survey . The form capture patient demographic socioeconomic data . Patients also ask aware availability ultrasound prior arrival . Outcomes The primary study outcome rate ratio ( RR ) total ANC clinic attendance intervention group control group . Secondary outcome include A ) RR attendance woman previously use TBA , B ) RR attendance woman yet attend ANC , C ) RR total attendance three intervention . Statistical Analysis Sub-counties chosen unit allocation number woman access ANC sub-county unit analysis . The sample size calculation perform priori utilized study design change implementation reason specify previously . We perform post-hoc power calculation . We assume distribution pregnant woman attend ANC Poisson distribute . We assume number pregnant woman community equal ( i.e . assume equal offset control intervention arm ) . We assume over-dispersion present conduct power calculation ( i.e . assume Poisson mean equal Poisson variance ) . Our goal test whether ratio Poisson rate equal 1 ( i.e . rate woman attend ANC equal control intervention arm ) . Assuming rate ratio 2 , require 25 woman attend ANC control arm 50 woman attend ANC intervention arm achieve 80 % power reject null hypothesis equal rate attendance . Assuming rate ratio 3 , require 10 woman attend ANC control arm 30 woman attend ANC intervention arm achieve 80 % power reject null hypothesis equal rate attendance . Demographic data summarize use simple descriptive statistic . We compute rate ANC uptake , first ANC use ANC uptake due pOBU , respectively , cluster level . The count number woman attend ANC , specific outcome , form numerator rate . The ideal denominator rate calculation would number woman aware pregnant study period . This denominator unavailable used number woman attend first ANC 2013-2014 government run clinic proxy . We express rate per 1,000 woman . Using Poisson regression , Pearson 's correction factor over-dispersion , test whether ratio rate control intervention arm equal . We compare estimate rate intervention group control group also intervention group intervention group ( compute possible pair-wise rate ratio trial arm ) . We choose reject null hypothesis equal rate ANC uptake 5 % alpha level . All statistical analysis conduct use SAS version 9.4 ( Cary , North Carolina ) . Since outcomes report health facility ( cluster ) level , special analysis account cluster conduct . Role Funding Source The funding source study Canadian profit corporation Bridge Health Medical Dental ( BTH ) . BTH primarily fund unrestricted donation Canadian corporation ( Cole Engineering , Lebovic Enterprises small donor ) , Canadian Rotary Clubs , small private donor . None donor conflict interest . None Canadian investigator receive personal compensation work project . The organization proprietary holding technology use study , investigator , receive financial compensation sale portable ultrasound technology . Some compensation time spend provide BTH Ugandan research team .</detailed_description>
