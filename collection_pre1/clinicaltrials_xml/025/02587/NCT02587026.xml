	<brief_summary>This tissue collection protocol create annotate biorepository support future basic translational research . The study protocol consent request patient permission allow specimen stored future use laboratory/correlative study without require separate new consent future date . It include also retrospective review patient see treated Precision Genomics Clinic ( waiver consent request ) . No specific research studies/aims include directly proposal . Use sample , data , resource ( cell line , etc . ) create within protocol require review/approval majority Precision Genomics Investigators appropriate IRB approval .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>1 . ≥ 18 year old time inform consent 2 . Ability provide write informed consent HIPAA authorization 3 . Patients must histologically cytologically confirm malignancy relate disorder . This include patient active disease well remission . 4 . One follow tissue collection situation Group 1 : Patients tissue collection clinical reason willing additional specimen take research ( biopsy may do local anesthesia , intravenous conscious sedation , general anesthesia , clinically indicate ) Group 2 : Patients willing undergo tissue collection purpose research ( biopsy may do local anesthesia intravenous conscious sedation per judgment treat physician ) . This may include collection additional sample patient undergo studyspecific research biopsy/procedure . Patients group 2 may undergo general anesthesia part protocol . Group 3 : Patients tissue collection clinical reason willing excess tissue ( i.e. , tissue would otherwise discard ) bank research ( biopsy may do local anesthesia , intravenous conscious sedation , general anesthesia , clinically indicate ) . 5 . Willingness undergo phlebotomy research blood sample Additional Criteria Patients Groups 1 2 6 . PT PTT level &lt; 1.2 x institutional ULN ( PT , PTT require skin biopsy ) 7 . Not receive therapeutic anticoagulation 8 . Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L 1 . Concurrent disease condition would make patient inappropriate study participation serious medical psychiatric disorder would interfere subject 's safety . 2 . Dementia , alter mental status , psychiatric condition would prohibit understanding rendering informed consent . 3 . History serious lifethreatening allergic reaction local anesthetic ( i.e . lidocaine , xylocaine ) 4 . Any condition , opinion patient 's treat oncologist physician perform biopsy procedure , would make participation protocol unreasonably hazardous patient . Additional Criteria Patients Group 1 2 5 . Pregnant woman exclude Groups 1 2 may increase risk mother fetus set conscious sedation , require biopsy certain anatomic site ( e.g . liver , lung , bone ) . Also , ionize radiation CTguided biopsy may pose risk unborn fetus . 6 . Patients Groups 1 2 may active cardiac disease , define : History uncontrolled symptomatic angina History arrhythmia require medication , clinically significant Myocardial infarction &lt; 6 month study entry Uncontrolled symptomatic congestive heart failure Any cardiac condition , opinion treat physician , would make protocol unreasonably hazardous patient 7 . Patients group 1 2 receive bevacizumab angiogenesis inhibitor ( less 6 week last dose angiogenesis inhibitor ) undergo research core liver biopsy protocol concern possibility increase bleed risk . Patients may undergo research fine needle aspiration ( FNA ) liver alternative . Patients may also undergo core research biopsy sit , discretion treat physician , physician take potential increase bleed and/or delay wound heal issue consideration .</criteria>
