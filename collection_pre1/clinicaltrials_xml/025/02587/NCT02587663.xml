	<brief_summary>This clinical trial study mammography target ultrasound without whole-breast ultrasound contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) find extent disease surgery patient newly diagnose breast cancer . New diagnostic imaging procedure , whole-breast ultrasound contrast-enhanced MRI , may help find far breast cancer spread . It yet know whether mammography target ultrasound effective without whole-breast ultrasound contrast-enhanced MRI finding far breast cancer spread .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine surgical treatment influence three image arm . II . To compare three image arm term accurately measure size index lesion number location tumor focus ( use surgical pathology gold standard ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . In woman dense breast : To retrospectively compare accuracy three image arm measure size index lesion number location tumor focus ( use surgical pathology gold standard ) . II . To report incidence synchronous contralateral breast cancer detect three image arm . OUTLINE : Patients assign 1 3 treatment group . GROUP 1 : Patients undergo standard care diagnostic imaging comprise bilateral mammography target breast ultrasound . GROUP 2 : Patients undergo standard care diagnostic image Group 1 . Patients also undergo bilateral whole-breast ultrasound . GROUP 3 : Patients undergo standard care diagnostic image Group 1 . Patients also undergo bilateral breast contrast-enhanced MRI . All patient undergo standard care breast conserving surgery , mastectomy test indicate change surgical plan .</detailed_description>
