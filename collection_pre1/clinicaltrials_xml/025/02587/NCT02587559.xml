	<detailed_description>This study pragmatic , prospective , single blind , randomize control trial . Stratified randomization perform account patient necessitate subacromial corticosteroid injection prior physical therapy intervention . The diagnosis primary glenohumeral osteoarthritis confirm orthopedic surgeon involve study . All subject radiographs time initial evaluation ( standard medical practice ) magnetic resonance imaging require discretion orthopedic surgeon modality necessary rule shoulder pathology concern . This study use convenient sample consecutive subject meet inclusion criterion present shoulder service physician UT Southwestern outpatient clinic primary compliant shoulder pain stiffness . If appropriate study , subject refer physical therapy additional assessment care . If interested participation , potential subject educate regard purpose logistics study ask enroll via informed consent . Approximately 25 50 subject see clinic 6 visit within 4 week time frame . All subject return follow-up phone call 4 , 8 , 52 week final data collection outcomes assessment . The last follow-up assessment one year via phone contact . For attend physical therapy , duration visit , 1-6 , last 30-60 min . The final visit , visit 9 , take 15-30 minute . The phone call tenth interaction last 5-10 minute . Session 1 : Participant Enrollment - Obtainment consent , HIPPA health screen . Baseline dependent variable data collection subject randomly allocate one treatment group . One group receive usual medical advice include tip posture , activity modification , symptom control . The group initiate program physical therapy outline . Subjects allocate physical therapy treatment arm proceed standard physical therapy visit instruct initial exercise training educate use exercise log assessment compliance . Session 2-6 ( within 4 week session 1 ) : All patient experimental group receive standardize physical therapy intervention treat shoulder osteoarthritis include manual therapy ( 2 unit , &lt; 37 minute ) standard flexibility range motion exercise . Patient 's also undergo clinic assessment compliance exercise program appropriate progression shoulder strengthen exercise provide . Patients control group participate session 2-5 . Independent Variable : Group 1 Intervention- manual physical therapy strengthening exercise entire upper quarter , flexibility exercise , range motion exercise , usual medical advice . Manual Therapy : joint mobilization anterior , posterior , inferior capsule indicate discretion treat physical therapist Shoulder Exercise Training : 1 . Adducted ER towel roll sit standing ( `` no-money '' exercise concurrent external rotation ) 2 . Supine stand boxer punch serratus 3 . Short arc military press progress flexion scaption tolerate 4 . Subscapularis isolation via seat narrow grip internal rotation row 5 . Horizontal abduction neutral ( wide grip row ) - Compliance home exercise program assess use daily log . - All therapeutic exercise include theraband resistance perform 2-3x20/daily Session 6 ( 4 week Session 1 ) : Post-Intervention Data Collection finalization exercise train self-mobilization protocol experimental group . The control group return repeat baseline test . Session 7 ( 8 week Session 1 ) : Post-Intervention Data Collection - Re-assessment dependent variable . Session 8 ( one year enrollment ) : Phone call collect outcome assessment data Dependent Variables : Primary 1 . Numerical pain rating scale baseline day 28 , day 56 , day 365 scapular plane shoulder elevation 2 . Functional Outcome Score : American Shoulder Elbow Surgeon scale ( ASES ) questionnaire Simple Shoulder Test ( SST ) Secondary 1 . Patient 's Global Rating Change ( 15 point ordinal scale range -7 +7 ) 2 . Patient self-reported global percentage improvement ( 0-100 % ) 3 . Tampa Scale Kinesiophobia score 4 . Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score 5 . Internal External Rotation Range Motion 6 . Scapular Elevation strength via manual muscle test</detailed_description>
