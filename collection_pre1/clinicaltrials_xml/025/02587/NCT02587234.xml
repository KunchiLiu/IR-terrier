	<brief_title>Driving Neuroplasticity With Nerve Stimulation Modified CIT</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke one devastate prevalent disease , effort limit amount tissue damage acute phase disappointing , highlight need effective therapeutic intervention neurologic damage occur . A major goal research stroke rehabilitation harness capacity brain reorganize neurologic damage occur thus ultimately lead successful recovery function . Data animal human model suggest sensory input play important role motor output , possibly influence cortical plasticity . However , spite advance date , little known extent sensory input form peripheral nerve stimulation successfully combined physical training . A new emerge approach call constraint-induced therapy ( CIT ) intensive functional motor training produce promising result field stroke rehabilitation . CIT involve restrain unaffected arm sling glove combine intense task-oriented therapy affect side six hour daily 2 week . This pilot study evaluate effectiveness sustain peripheral nerve stimulation couple functional motor training improve hand motor function . While functional motor training follow identical principle CIT , length daily training shorten 4 hour daily thus investigator refer proposal modify CIT . Preliminary data study demonstrate peripheral nerve stimulation result increase cortical motor excitability normal subject . In addition , learn use-dependent plasticity substantially enhance single session 2 hour peripheral nerve stimulation chronic stroke patient . The goal study test hypothesis stroke patient treat upper extremity peripheral nerve stimulation precede CIT ( intervention group ) improve hand motor function compare group receive low extremity peripheral nerve stimulation CIT ( control group ) .</detailed_description>
