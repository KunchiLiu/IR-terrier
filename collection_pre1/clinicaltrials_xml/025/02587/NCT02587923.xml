	<detailed_description>INTRODUCTION Small gastric subepithelial tumor ( SETs ) often incidental finding upper endoscopy . Differential diagnosis include variety different pathology gastrointestinal stromal tumor ( GISTs ) , leiomyoma , leiomyosarcomas , lipomas , carcinoid tumor , granular cell tumor , duplication cyst pancreatic rest . Since entity potential malignancy , accurate classification gastric SETs essential define best diagnostic therapeutic management . Endosonography ( EUS ) current gold standard characterization small gastric SETs . It provide differentiation extra- intramural lesion , information involvement certain wall layer , measurement lesion well structural analysis accord echogenicity lesion . Nevertheless , level uncertainty remain , even lesion show typical echo‐pattern layer involvement . According current guideline , lesion two centimeter size suspect GISTs remove surgical resection . Lesions le one centimeter follow annual EUS . For lesion big one centimeter small two centimeter tissue sample recommend order correctly diagnose lesion accord immunohistochemical marker ( CD117 CD34 GISTs ) quantify malignant potential accord histological factor ( mitotic index GISTs ) [ 1 ] . Tissue sample do use standard jumbo forceps biopsy EUS‐guided fine needle aspiration biopsy , diagnostic yield method rather low [ 2,3 ] . Better result achieve endoscopic resection technique endoscopic submucosal dissection ( ESD ) , submucosal tunnel endoscopic resection full thickness endoscopic resection [ 4,5 ] . The main advantage approach diagnostic also therapeutic strategy since respective lesion resect whole comparable conventional surgery . However , high risk procedure related adverse event bleed perforation ( latter often unavoidable consider SETs arise deep wall layer muscularis propria layer ) . Endoscopic unroofing similar mention endoscopic resection technique main difference partial resection intend order get representative tissue specimen histological evaluation . This method describe case series Lee et al . 2010 show favorable diagnostic yield gastric SETs [ 6 ] . To date , study report follow‐up lesion investigate endoscopic unroofing . The aim present study evaluate endoscopic unroofing small gastric SETs regard safety , diagnostic yield potential therapeutic effect time . PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS Endoscopic unroofing high diagnostic accuracy small gastric subepithelial tumor . METHODS This retrospective study conduct Division Gastroenterology Hepatology , Department Internal Medicine III . Of Medical University Vienna . Patients underwent endoscopic unroofing gastric subepithelial tumor 2000 2015 identify search endoscopy reporting database `` DOKMON '' . Clinical data collect patient identify review endoscopy examination report well clinical document include discharge letter report archive database `` AKIM '' . The following parameter assess : Demographics ( age , sex ) , indication endoscopic unroofing , intraprocedural adverse event , hospital stay , histological result , follow‐up procedure ( include endoscopic imaging control , surgical resection ) . At end study mention parameter present use descriptive statistic . Data analysis perform use SPSS 23.0 . All patient relate data de‐identified use pseudonymization prior processing . SAMPLE SIZE The investigator expect encounter approximately 20 patient study ( 2000 2015 ) .</detailed_description>
