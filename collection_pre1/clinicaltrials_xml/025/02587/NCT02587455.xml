	<brief_summary>Lung cancer second common cancer UK around 43,500 new patient diagnosed year . About 69 % patient diagnose advanced stage disease present patient would expect survive less 12 month . These statistic therefore show need development new effective drug treatment advance Lung cancer . Recent trial result show efficacy immunotherapy treat several type tumour include lung cancer . These tumour know express high level glycoprotein call PDL1 component PD1 pathway . In cancer PD1 pathway hijack tumour lead immune system suppress . The aim new drug Pembrolizumab restart PD1 pathway use immune system help fight cancer cell . Radiotherapy also show cause cancer increase production proteins block immune system . Therefore propose combine new immunotherapy agent pembrolizumab radiotherapy treatment lung cancer allow cancer cell kill immune system . The purpose study see pembrolizumab safety combine standard palliative radiotherapy patient lung cancer . In addition patient complete course radiotherapy remain pembrolizumab alone study look well treatment regimen control growth cancer .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Risk burden patient Patients first part study cancer longer respond standard anticancer drug treatments.The phase 1 nature study mean trial intervention may additional benefit patient take part study . The study carry number potential burden : - Study drug radiotherapy : Although study drug safety effect previously assess NSCLC side effect cause addition radiotherapy unconfirmed . These risk manage much possible cautious dose escalation : phase 1 study , data cohort review safety review committee decide whether increase dose subsequent cohort . Participants review regularly experience clinician study treatment . Comprehensive assessment safety carry . - Burden frequent hospital visit test : Participants study must attend hospital frequently , particularly start study , safety reason check toxicity study treatment . Blood test , clinical examination , urine test , haematology , bio chemistry lung function test part safety assessment . Additionally , research purpose participant may ask additional blood take , mandatory entry study . 2 . Recruitment Participants offer information study clinical team consider meet entry criterion ( regard advance disease without therapeutic option , suitable performance status ) express interest take part experimental study . It make clear study experimental nature necessarily therapeutic benefit take part study . It also make clear , patient decide take part future care affect . Patients give sufficient time information make inform decision enter trial , patient enter trial give write informed consent . 4 . Confidentiality Patients link unique identifier code hold password protect database held study team . This study run Royal Marsden Hospital Only . Research blood tumour data analyse team Institute cancer Research . Sample process take place use trial ID . No patient identifiable information available study sample . Investigators access patient identifiable information password protect NHS hospital note databases . 5 . Conflict Interest Patients may recruit study involve prior clinical care . The investigator expect conflict interest research healthcare duties number reason : patient must give full inform consent enter study , specifically regard unknown efficacy study drug . Those patient continue study maintain relationship clinical team require symptom control . At end study , patient able access result wish , Royal Marsden Website . They also send write summary result indicate . 6 . Use tissue sample future research If participant give consent , leftover blood tissue sample require study store future unspecified research line human tissue act regulation . Access use sample research purpose require appropriate ethical approval . Future researcher able identify individual patient biobank data , demographic clinical information available .</detailed_description>

Have provide tissue archival tissue sample newly obtain core excisional biopsy tumour lesion . 7 . Have performance status 02 ECOG Performance Scale . 8 . Demonstrate adequate organ function , screen lab perform within 10 day confirmation eligibility . 9 . Patient 's lung function test baseline FEV1 &gt; 0.8L &gt; 30 % . 10 . See protocol section . 1 . Is currently participate participate study investigational agent use investigational device within 4 week first dose treatment . 2 . Has diagnosis immunodeficiency receive systemic steroid therapy form immunosuppressive therapy within 7 day prior first dose trial treatment . 3 . Has prior monoclonal antibody within 4 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due agent administer 4 week earlier . 4 . Previous radiotherapy lung 5 . Has prior chemotherapy , target small molecule therapy , radiation therapy within 4 week prior study Day 1 recover ( i.e. , ≤ Grade 1 baseline ) adverse event due previously administer agent . Note : Patients ≤ Grade 2 neuropathy exception criterion may qualify study . Note : If patient receive major surgery , must recover adequately toxicity and/or complication intervention prior start therapy . 6 . Has know additional malignancy progress require active treatment . Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma skin , squamous cell carcinoma skin , situ cervical cancer undergone potentially curative therapy . 7 . Has know active central nervous system ( CNS ) metastases and/or carcinomatous meningitis . Patients previously treat brain metastasis may participate provide stable ( without evidence progression image least four week prior first dose trial treatment neurologic symptom return baseline ) , evidence new enlarge brain metastasis , use steroid least 7 day prior trial treatment . 8 . Has active autoimmune disease require systemic treatment within past 3 month document history clinically severe autoimmune disease , syndrome require systemic steroid immunosuppressive agent . Patients vitiligo resolve childhood asthma/atopy would exception rule . Patients require use bronchodilator local steroid injection would exclude study . Patients hypothyroidism stable hormone replacement Sjorgen 's syndrome exclude study . 9 . Has evidence interstitial lung disease active , noninfectious pneumonitis . 10 . Has receive prior therapy antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 , antiCD137 , anti Cytotoxic Tlymphocyte associate antigen4 ( CTLA4 ) antibody ( include ipilimumab antibody drug specifically target Tcell costimulation checkpoint pathway ) . 11 .
