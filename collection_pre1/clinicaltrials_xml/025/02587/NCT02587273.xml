	<brief_title>The Pharmacokinetics Fentanyl Intensive Care Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Patients admit Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) treatment involve mechanical ventilation need sedation analgesia order relieve pain discomfort necessary therapeutic procedure ( 1-7 ) . The opioid fentanyl frequently use part sedation regimen ( 1-7 ) . The pharmacokinetics ( PK ) pharmacodynamics ( PD ) fentanyl long-term administration ICU patient study extensively . In study child ( fentanyl infusion time 7-144 hr . ) , increased volume distribution find compare data obtain short-term use ( 9 ) . The volume distribution alfentanil increase compare data obtain short-term use study adult ICU patient sedate propofol alfentanil ( rapid-onset opioid ) 24 hr . post-operatively ( 10 ) . A similar increase distribution volume another opioid , sufentanil , find adult ICU patient ( average sufentanil infusion time 12 day ) ( 11 ) . Experience obtain clinical anaesthesia suggest duration action fentanyl significantly prolong long-term intravenous infusion ( 12-13 ) . This property fentanyl seem cause combination factor . Since fentanyl large volume distribution continuous return drug peripheral tissue , concentration fentanyl plasma maintain clinically active range time fentanyl infusion terminate ( 9 ) . Fentanyl also potentiate sedative effect e.g . propofol midazolam contribute protraction wake-up time ( 14-15 ) . In ICU patient undesirable effect fentanyl probably amplify result major change volume distribution administration fentanyl infusion extensive period time ( week ) . The investigator believe knowledge PK fentanyl population valuable help design optimised infusion regimen fentanyl clinical setting ICU . Study Objective : The main study objective determine wether pharmacokinetics fentanyl change ICU stay , extent change . The investigator try unveil factor ( e.g physiological variable ) cause change , base simulation , determine context-sensitive half-times fentanyl ICU patient . As result study investigator aim develop infusion pump program predict fentanyl plasma concentration , recovery time fentanyl effect ( time plasma concentration 1 ng/ml ) . Furthermore investigator intend test fentanyl infusion pump program predict fentanyl plasma concentration separate group ICU patient . Study Procedures : In study administration investigational product per study protocol . The dosage administration fentanyl accord ICUs establish procedure treat physician 's judgment appropriate patient . In ICUs Oslo University Hospital fentanyl administer intravenously continuous infusion infusion pump System need single bolus dos give handheld syringe . By routine ICUs Oslo University Hospital usually dose fentanyl infusion 0,5 - 6 μg/kg/hrs , kg calculation patient Ideal Body Weight . The fentanyl use marketed stock ICUs deliver hospital pharmacy . All medication label information store accord local regulation . Participants recruit surgical , neurosurgical medical ICUs . On study day investigator screen patient admit ICU last 24 hr . If patient eligible study due selection criterion , include chronological order . Each subject must give his/hers informed consent . The gravity clinical situation ICU patient may preclude informed consent inclusion study . In case , patient 's relative ( legal representative ) receive information study , provide opportunity express opinion . If patient´s relative ( legal representative ) participation , patient include . Daily sedation cessation spontaneous awaken trial implement standard treatment regimens ICU 's Oslo University Hospital . In study investigator intend collect blood sample sedation cessation period , fentanyl administer patient . If participant need opioid analgesia period , alternative opioid painkiller give . The first blood sample collect right administration fentanyl temporarily stop . During follow hour repeat sample collect . The sample collect randomly within time block contain consecutive time point . Each participant accordingly contribute sample entire collection time period . Fentanyl give prescribe treat physician sedation cessation period end . Samples spinned stored ice biobank later analysis The Dept . Clinical Pharmacology , St.Olavs Hospital , Trondheim , Norway . If participant study undergo treatment continuous veno venous haemodialysis ( CVVHD ) , investigator want ass whether haemodialysis influence degree change fentanyl PK . Haemodialysis think minimal effect upon clearance fentanyl , since fentanyl mostly clear non-renal mechanism . In addition fentanyl high molecular weight , high protein bind capacity , low water solubility abundant volume distribution make less likely dialyzable ( 16-17 ) . There collect blood sample prefilter postfilter line hemodialysis machine asses dialysis filter might absorb fentanyl remove drug circulation . The sample time follow predefined block-sampling regimen arterial blood test . Investigators also plan calculate dialysis clearance fentanyl subset 10 patient . Fentanyl primarily metabolize liver Cytochrome P450 3A ( CYP3A ) enzymatic route ( 18-19 ) . A study genetic marker polymorphism gene cod enzyme could possibly explain variation fentanyl PK ICU population ( 20-21 ) . There collect blood sample later DNA process search relevant genetic marker polymorphisms Cytochrome P450 enzymes . The main metabolite fentanyl norfentanyl ( 18-19 ) . Concentration norfentanyl daily arterial blood sample quantify make possible calculate metabolic ratio fentanyl/norfentanyl . The metabolic ratio indicate extent participant metabolize fentanyl without take plasma concentration account . Norfentanyl eliminate kidney ( 18-19 ) . There take daily sample urine determine urine concentration metabolite . To ass possible covariates fentanyl PK , patient demographic , medical history , co-morbidity , data descriptive population , concomitant medication daily registration organ function parameter record patient study period . Assessments blood sample continue long patient need artificial ventilation treat significant amount fentanyl .</detailed_description>
