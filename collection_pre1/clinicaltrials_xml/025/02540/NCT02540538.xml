	<brief_title>Safety Immunogenicity HBAI20 Hepatitis B Vaccine Naive Adults Non-responders</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : Worldwide , people suffer consequence Hepatitis B ( HB ) virus infection . Currently available vaccine protective vaccinee , however , small part population respond vaccine ( non-responders ) . A new adjuvant ( AI20 ) develop CyTuVax improve standard Hepatitis B vaccine protection non-responders . The AI20 adjuvant consist depot-attached rhuIL-2 ( aggregate Interleukin-2 molecule attach alum ) , facilitate slow release highly concentrated IL-2 nano aggregate . As show preclinical experiment , vaccination mouse , rat , rabbit new HBAI20 vaccine result higher early immune response Hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) compare vaccination one standard Hepatitis B vaccine . This clinical study do order ass safety AI20 adjuvant test AI20 adjuvanted Hepatitis B vaccine induces protective antibody titer vaccinate non-responders . Objective : In current study investigate safety HBAI20 vaccine . Furthermore , efficacy HBAI20 vaccine non-responders investigate . Study design : Partly double blind randomize control intervention phase I study , partly open-label phase I study . Study population : Healthy volunteer ( n=24 ) register non-responders ( n=12 ) , 18-59 year old , males female . Intervention : The study include 3 group . HB vaccine naïve healthy subject randomize group 1 2 register non-responders include group 3 . `` Group 1 '' subject receive standard HB vaccine ( HBVaxPro-10µg ) , `` Group 2 '' `` Group 3 '' subject receive HBAI20 vaccine . 2 subject `` Group 3 '' constitute `` Group 3 pilot '' start study 7 day start remain `` Group 3 '' subject . All study subject group 2 3 receive two vaccination assign investigational medical product ( IMP ) 0 1 month one regular booster vaccination standard HB vaccine HBVaxPro-10µg 6 month first dose accord recommend vaccination schedule HBVaxPro-10µg . Main study parameters/endpoints : The primary study parameter number intensity local systemic adverse reaction ( redness , swell , impaired movement ) . The secondary study parameter HBAI20 vaccine immunogenicity calculate median titer , geometric mean titer , geometric mean titer increase , proportion subject virus specific antibody titer measure COBAS system ≥ 10 mIU/ml , seroconversion rate . Seroconversion define four-fold increase titer conversion seronegative anti-HBsAg antibody titer 10 mIU/ml vaccination . Nature extent burden risk associate participation , benefit group relatedness : Study subject vaccinate 3 time 0 , 1 6 month begin study invite hospital 8 visit . The risk associate participation study consider low comparable standard vaccine . Physical discomfort vaccine administration occur injection site ( redness , swell , etc . ) systemically ( fever , fatigue , headache ) . Effects expect occur short period time ( within first 4 day first second injection ) . In addition subject may experience adverse reaction cytokine component adjuvant . Because low dose cytokine component adjuvant , gradually release , risk expect low . The potential risk venepuncture blood sample mild pain haematoma , consider low . The naïve subject participate study benefit participate receive immunization Hepatitis B . Subjects non-responder group may benefit become responder due effect HBAI20 vaccine .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>In good health determine outcome medical history , physical examination screening/baseline labs clinical judgment clinical investigator Age 18 59 year , inclusive time enrolment Willing able adhere study regimen Having sign informed consent form Nonresponders : Documented nonresponders : Subjects document two cycle Hepatitis B vaccination ( total 6 vaccination ) titer analysis show develop Hepatitis B antibody titer recommend standard vaccination : antiHBsAg antibody titer high 10mIU/ml . Any infectious disease time screen and/or enrolment Positive HIV , Hepatitis B virus Hepatitis C virus serology Positive antiIL2 antibody titer Known suspect immune deficiency Known suspect disease influence immune system include chronic allergy require frequent antiallergy medication , cancer transplantation recipient Known suspected allergy vaccine component . Dialysis patient History unusual severe reaction previous vaccination History neurologic disorder , include epilepsy autism Use medication influence immune system ( immune suppressive treatment ) Any vaccination within 3 month screen Blood donation within 1 month screen Administration plasma ( incl . immunoglobulin ) blood product within 12 month screen Participation another clinical trial within 3 month screen Abnormal pretreatment laboratory parameter clinically relevant accord investigator Bleeding disorder , use medication bleeding disorder , use anticoagulant Female subject plan become pregnant breastfeeding baby visit 7 Females : positive urine pregnancy test . Urine test positive screening date positive urine pregnancy test day vaccination Excessive alcohol control drug use More 2 alcohol measure per day ( one alcohol measure beer ( 250ml ) one glass wine ( 125ml ) one strong measure ( 35ml ) one port/sherry ( 75ml ) ) . Regular use control drug Exclusion criterion Hepatitis B naïve subject ( group 1 2 ) : Previous vaccination Hepatitis B vaccine Exclusion criterion nonresponders ( group 3 ) : Any Hepatitis B vaccination last 6 month Temporary exclusion criterion vaccination Ear temperature &gt; 38.4°C lead postponement participation vaccination . Screening may continue temperature normalize .</criteria>
