	<brief_summary>Increased plasma homocysteine level associate macroangiopathy nephropathy type 2 diabetes . Also increased level serum homocysteine associate microalbuminuria associate increase cardiovascular morbidity mortality among patient type 2 diabetes . With B12 supplementation homocysteine level reduce .Type 2 diabetes metabolic syndrome may show improvement glycaemic control Vitamin B12 therapy correction hyperhomocysteinemia . In study prove combination vit B12 , folic acid vit B6 effective hyperhomocysteinemia.There separate trial use vit B12 alone . This therapy may use large number type 2 uncontrolled diabetic hyperhomocysteinemic patient . study plan follow objective study effect Vitamin B12 supplementation glycaemic control poorly control hyperhomocysteinemic type 2 diabetic patient 1 . Glycaemic control measure level glycosylated haemoglobin ( HbA1c ) baseline 4 week 2 . Fasting blood sugar level baseline 4 week 3 . Serum homocysteine/ vitamin B12 level baseline 4 week 4 . Serum lipid profile baseline 4 week</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>After approval Institutional Ethics Committee , patient respond adequately oral anti-diabetic agent recruit Medicine patient department ( OPD ) help treat physician . Patient first screen serum homocysteine/vitamin B12 level along baseline investigation . Those serum homocysteine level 15 umol/L vitamin B12 level le 223pg/ml enrol study . Due high cost investigation serum homocysteine level measure 6 patient serum vitamin B12 level ( cheap test ) measure 14 patient prior permission Ethics Committee . Patients give information Vitamin B12 ( methylcobalamin ) include adverse effect . A write informed consent take patient willing participate study enrol study . All information record case report form . There two group poorly control patient ; one group ( DRUG GROUP ) receive methylcobalamin 500 ug daily usual antidiabetic therapy group ( CONTROL GROUP ) receive suitable antidiabetic drug therapy prescribe treat physician . Methylcobalamin 500ug give daily period 4 week followed-up 4 week . At Baseline investigation carry follow : Study Flow Chart Baseline Serum Homocysteine.n=6 ( DRUG GROUP ) , Serum Vitamin B12 , n=14 ( DRUG GROUP ) , n=18 ( CONTROL GROUP ) Body weight , height , Blood pressure , glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) level , Blood sugar-Fasting/Postprandial , Serum lipid profile ( measure effect Vitamin B12 ) , Blood urea , Serum creatinine , Serum Bilirubin , Serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase ( SGOT ) , Serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase ( SGPT ) , Alkaline phosphatase ( rule hepatic renal dysfunction ) , Routine urine examination albumin , Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) : rule cardiac abnormality viz , IHD , arrhythmias 4 Weeks Body weight , Blood pressure , glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) level , Blood sugar-Fasting/Postprandial , Serum lipid profile , Serum homocysteine/ serum vitamin B12 , Urine albumin examination After enrollment patient study , All baseline investigation carry Central Clinical Laboratory except glycosylated haemoglobin carry department Pharmacology homocysteine estimation carry accredited laboratory . ECG , Blood pressure record carry Department Medicine . Reporting Adverse effect : All patient give checklist adverse effect vitamin B12 . Information adverse drug reaction ( ADRs ) take next follow-up . If patient unable tolerate adverse drug reaction advise contact investigator time . Contact number investigator mention patient information sheet . Expected adverse drug reaction vitamin B12 : Anorexia , Nausea , Vomiting , Diarrhea Rash Sample Size Calculation statistical analysis : Sample size 20 group calculate ratio 1 , power 80 % , consider 10 fold difference drug effect vitamin B12 group control group use Open Epi 2.3 ( 2009 ) . Randomization do help randomization software Rando 1.2,2004 . Statistical analysis do use Open Epi 2.3 ( 2009 ) Microsoft Excel .</detailed_description>
