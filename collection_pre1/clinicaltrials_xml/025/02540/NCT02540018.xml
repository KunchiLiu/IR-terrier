	<brief_title>Effectiveness Paclitaxel-coated Luminor® Balloon Catheter Versus Uncoated Balloon Catheter Arteria Femoralis Superficialis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigational medical device represent Paclitaxel drug-eluting Luminor®-35 balloon catheter base proprietary transfertech coat technology . This engineer improve clinical efficacy optimize coat property device functionality . This allow homogeneous precise Paclitaxel concentration 3 μg/mm2 PTA balloon surface . The balloon dilatation procedure , include deployment target lesion balloon inflation , deflation retrieval , perform fluoroscopic observation . All sit shall access emergency unit perform also interventions bypass surgery e.g . case fail percutaneous transluminal angioplasty ( PTA ) . The patient position angiographic table drape sterile fashion . The standard vascular access represent ipsilateral contralateral femoral artery accordance target vessel . The endovascular procedure perform direct antegrade cross-over retrograde technique . An introducer sheath insert guidewire . 5.000 I.U . heparin inject i.a . pre-vent peri-procedural thrombotic event . Alternative peri-procedural anti-coagulation regimen may apply justified individual patient requirement . An endoluminal guidewire passage stenotic occlusive femoro-popliteal lesion mandatory study inclusion . A POBA PTA balloon appropriate balloon diameter length , catheter work length select accord characteristic target vessel lesion pre-dilation assess angiography ( DSA XA ) . A ruler adjacent target vessel . After pre-dilatation target lesion angiographic assessment perform ( DSA XA ) . A ruler adjacent target vessel . Randomization perform envelope pull . The treatment group represent Lumi-nor® DEB control group POBA apply CE-marked non-drug-eluting PTA balloon catheter . In patient peripheral artery disease , quantitative vascular angiography ( QVA ) essential analysis degree arterial stenosis . For quantitative assessment stenotic lesion , residual lumen lesion site compare lumen reference site . QVA assess independent core lab . The assessment angioplasty perform pre- post-procedure , 6 month follow-up unscheduled procedure necessary . Follow-up ( FU ) assessments occur pre-discharge , 6 month 12 month follow study procedure .</detailed_description>
