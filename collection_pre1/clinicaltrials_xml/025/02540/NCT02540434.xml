	<brief_summary>The study align strategic plan New York-Presbyterian Hospital ( NYPH ) reduce allogeneic blood product use decrease unnecessary laboratory cost . One NYPH Quality Patient Safety Goals 2013 improve appropriate use transfusion guideline reduce unnecessary red blood cell ( RBC ) transfusion . Further , study help answer whether RiaSTAP effective product treat bleed cryoprecipitate . In addition , trial provide investigator preliminary data apply future federal funding opportunity , National Heart Lung Blood Institute sponsor R21 grant ( PAR-13-025 ) encourage research grant application investigator propose study research topic blood bank transfusion medicine aim improve safety availability blood supply practice transfusion medicine . The investigator anticipate future follow-on study investigate fibrinogen concentrate similar therapeutic perioperative population , postpartum hemorrhage surgical ICU setting . Finally , study involves use safe therapeutic , fibrinogen concentrate , improve patient care patient safety . This product require time-intensive process thawing ; therefore , delay patient care avoid product readily available OR .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Trial RiaSTAP Versus Cryoprecipitate Lower Operative Transfusions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All eligible subject undergoing cardiac surgery require cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical College invite participate . Consenting subject enrol treat accord protocol . Study investigator anticipate consent eligible cardiovascular surgical subject , investigator omit result subject may present microvascular bleeding CPB . It well known microvascular bleeding occurs often reoperations complex , open cardiac procedure , coronary revascularization valve repair/replacement , aortic replacement deep hypothermic circulatory arrest . Enrolled subject receive intraoperative anesthetic , anticoagulation , laboratory testing , hemodynamic management accord WCMC standard practice . The need blood product , include fibrinogen supplementation ( CRYO/FIB ) , assess use point-of-care ( ROTEM ) base transfusion algorithm ( Appendix A ) ensure consistency accuracy treatment . The cardiac anesthesiologist surgeon currently use ROTEM algorithm treatment bleed cardiovascular surgery CPB part routine clinical practice WCMC . The algorithm place great 9 month prior study initiation . Randomization occur blood bank study product ( CRYO/FIB ) request treat intraoperative acquire hypofibrinogenemia ( base ROTEM tracing ) . Transfusion randomize study product ( CRYO/FIB ) , however , occur surgeon declares presence microvascular bleeding . Surgeons blind subject 's ROTEM result randomize study arm . Intraoperative anesthesiologist blind two product require different preparation administration technique blind easily . Once subject randomize study intervention receive product subsequent point procedure fibrinogen replacement require . If microvascular bleeding occur indication ROTEM algorithm administer CRYO/FIB , subject revert standard care treatment guide ROTEM traditional laboratory testing . The subject randomize study . In case abnormal ROTEM parameter clinical evidence microvascular bleeding evaluate cardiac surgeon , subject continue monitor carefully bleed remainder procedure . If non-surgical bleeding subsequently observe prior chest closure consensus fibrinogen need base ROTEM result ( FIBTEM A10 less equal 10 mm ) , subject treat randomized study product accord algorithm . Following completion procedure , postoperative coagulation management accord standard practice guide standard laboratory testing , possible . Unless persistent bleeding note , subject receive aspirin ( 300 mg per rectum ) 6 hour postoperatively . Subjects mechanical mitral tissue valve anticoagulated warfarin ( heparin bridge ) start postoperative day two ( POD # 2 ) . Any subject experience significant arrhythmia ( e.g . atrial fibrillation perioperative setting ) also anticoagulated warfarin . Pharmacologic deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) prophylaxis follow usual standard care . Subjects enrol , randomize , transfuse study product observe hospital discharge ( total observation time ) . Research staff Department Anesthesiology collect outcome data , include transfuse blood product , laboratory result , evidence perioperative thrombosis infection , return OR , length stay , mortality use case report form report enter collect data secure REDCap database .</detailed_description>
