	<brief_summary>Patients non-traumatic low limb amputation characterize ; high age ; majority men ; multimorbidity ; high mortality . The patient comorbidities relate diabetes cardiovascular disorder arteriosclerosis . Major surgery induces surgical stress response initiate catabolic metabolism . Furthermore , risk systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( SIRS ) amputation high ( 3 ) prominent indication amputation gangrene , follow non-healing infected wound . This lead impaired immune response increase insulin resistance also include cascade impair appetite regulation , low dietary intake reduce nutrient uptake form intestine increase inflammation , loss muscle risk severe complication . Among healthy adult normal weight slow speed eat result low nutritional intake due faster satiety experience . Low appetite follow major surgery relate regulation hormone control appetite . Especially old patient experience variation appetite affect eating pattern eat speed intake . It therefore reasonable assume speed eat total nutritional intake among old patient , expose catabolic metabolism , associate . The hypothesis major surgery induces change patient ' current eating pattern measurable identify surrogate measurement catabolic state relate inflammation . Eating Patterns often describe clinical practice without engage nutritional assessment patient . Whether speed eat objective marker current nutritional status establish . This study investigate patient undergo low limb amputation nutritional status , eat pattern inflammation whether link current degree disease . The purpose describe development nutritional status amputation investigate association patient eat pattern nutritional status inflammatory metabolic biomarkers reflect degree disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Nutrition Inflammation Among Patients With Lower Limb Amputation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The study observational cohort study include patient low limb amputation admission discharge . Patients admit special amputation-unit outpatient clinic , emergency department department hospital . All patient low limb amputation treat accord rehabilitation programme include multidisciplinary approach well-defined treatment pain , fluid , nutrition mobilisation . All patient receive standardise house diet prepared hospital kitchen . The diet consist 18 % protein , 40 % lipid 42 % carbohydrate . The house diet supplement minimum three in-between meal prepare dietary kitchen . The use protein supplement also available . Patients´ food fluid intake monitored daily . Data nutrition eat pattern The eating pattern measure use digital weight measure gram per second . The weight link raspberry computer recodes output weight . The record start plate place weight end meal complete . To measure appetite hunger arbitrary VAS scale use evaluate patients´ current desire eat , hungry , full fell , want eat . The patients´ nutritional status evaluate use Mini Nutritional Assessment ( MNA ) . MNA valid tool ass risk undernutrition among old people . The MNA consist screen tool ( max 14 point , &lt; 11 indicates risk undernutrition ) evaluation tool ( max 16 point ) . A total point &lt; 23,5 indicates need nutritional therapy . The patients´ behaviour regard eat food evaluate use Eating Identity Type Inventory ( EITI ) . EITI consist 8 statement evaluate 5 level agreement . The patients´ appetite evaluate use Simplified nutritional Appetite Questionnaire ( SNAQ ) . SNAQ tool validate evaluate old patients´ appetite . SNAQ consist four question five possible answer max score 20 point . A score &lt; 14 point indicate risk weight loss 5 % . Data Inflammation metabolism To describe change inflammation metabolic status , serum plasma sample collect inclusion , day surgery 1 , 3 , 5 , 10 postoperative day . A total 350 ml blood collect period 12 day . The analysis expect consist inflammatory metabolic biomarkers . All sample contain minus 80 degree minus 135 degree immucells . The degree disease measure use biomarker suPAR associate degree disease , LOS mortality . A clinical difference 2-3 ng/ml . Data protein metabolism To evaluate protein metabolism , 10 patient undergoing ankle amputation bladder catheter insert day surgery , collect 24-hour urine sample . The catheter hereafter remove . This do 1 , 5 , 10 postoperative day . Demographic baseline data Data patients´ sex , age , marital status , residence , functional mobility , comorbidities , smoke alcohol use , medication , educational working status , use homecare service collect . The patients´ muscle strength measure use handgrip strength dominant hand prior surgery 5 , 10 postoperative day discharge . Complications Complications hospitalisation register categorise ; cardio respiratory , metabolic , infection lack healing , re-amputation revision within 30 day , 30 day mortality . The analysis data include investigation : whether suPAR dependent nutritional intake whether ; patient ' eat pattern use objective description current nutritional status ; inflammation dependent nutritional intake ; complication dependent nutritional intake . We also investigate protein metabolism low limb amputation . Power calculation The aim study describe association patient eat pattern nutritional status degree disease among old patient undergo low limb amputation . We calculate ; power 80 % ; statically significant level 5 % ; minimum difference suPAR 2,5ng/ml patient receive sufficient nourishment ( assume 50 % patient achieve sufficient nourishment hospitalisation ) SD 2.8 ng/ml ( suPAR ) number include patient 42 . An estimate dropout set 20 % ( 8 patient ) result inclusion 50 patient . The primary outcome change suPAR , biomarker relate degree disease , hospitalization death . The outcome measure 10 day surgery . The secondary outcome ; nutritional intake measure daily protein ( g/kg ) energy ( kilojoule/kg ) intake , eat rate measure g/min , total length meal , activity ( activity plate compare intake ) , biomarkers inflammation metabolism ; protein balance measure urine urea nitrogen 24-hour urine sample ; revision re-amputation ; LOS 30 day mortality .</detailed_description>
