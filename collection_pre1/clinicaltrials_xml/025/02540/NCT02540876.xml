	<brief_title>Ilorasertib Treating Patients With CDKN2A-deficient Advanced Metastatic Solid Cancers That Can Be Removed Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To perform serial tumor volume-based growth trajectory assessment set candidate therapeutic molecularly define subset advanced cancer patient . II . To enable patient physician make informed individualized assessment ilorasertib treatment effect CDKN2A-deficient tumor . III . To develop new technology quantitative measurement plasma tumor deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) compute tomography ( CT ) imaging volume measurement method evaluate treatment effect advance solid tumor . IV . To generate descriptive , proof-of-concept data inform investigation ilorasertib solid tumor . OUTLINE : Patients receive ilorasertib orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) day 1 , 8 , 15 , 29 , 36 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 2 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .</detailed_description>
