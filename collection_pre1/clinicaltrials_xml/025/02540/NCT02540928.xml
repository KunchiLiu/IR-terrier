	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine whether drug call AMG 319 effect patient 's immune response head neck cancer squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) . This study specifically patient surgery treat HNSCC</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AMG 319 HPV Positive Negative HNSCC</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Cancers use 'defence mechanism ' hide immune system teach immune system destroy cancer cell . AMG 319 work block defence mechanism tumour . It target block important protein call PI3K delta . In laboratory lead removal group inhibitory immune cell . Releasing immune brake lead immune attack destruction cancer cell . AMG 319 look promise laboratory study early study small number patient leukaemia wish find useful treating patient head neck cancer . This study randomise , doubleblind , placebo control Phase II trial look effect give AMG 319 patient either human papilloma virus ( HPV ) positive negative head neck cancer squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) . We propose treat patient prior resection surgery study effect AMG 319 cancer fine detail . Approximately 54 patient HPV positive negative HNSCC hypopharynx , oropharynx , oral cavity , supraglottis larynx enter study . Patients randomly assign one two treatment group receive 20 29 day oral dose AMG 319 placebo immediately resection surgery .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : 1 . Histologically proven HNSCC hypopharynx , oropharynx , oral cavity , supraglottis larynx ( except T1 glottic tumour ) surgery curative intent ± post operative radiotherapy chemoradiotherapy consider primary treatment choice . Surgery schedule take place sooner 21 day later 30 day post first dose AMG 319 placebo . Patients present recurrence consider inclusion , long previous treatment include radiotherapy ± chemotherapy anti cancer therapy i.e . treat surgery alone take place within 6 month prior trial entry . Patients present second primary HNSCC consider inclusion , long previous radiotherapy , chemotherapy anti cancer therapy complete 5 year prior trial entry . 2 . Patients consider fit undergo curative resection surgery . 3 . Haematological biochemical index within range show : Laboratory Test Value require Haemoglobin ( Hb ) ≥100 g/L Absolute neutrophil count ≥1.5 x 109/L Platelet count ≥100 x 109/L Bilirubin ≤1.5 x upper limit normal ( ULN ) Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) and/or aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≤2.5 x ULN Alkaline Phosphatase ( alk phos/ALP ) ≤2.5 x ULN Amylase ≤2.0 x ULN Calculated creatinine clearance ( use Wright CockcroftGault formula ) ≥50 mL/min 4 . 18 year time informed consent give . 5 . Written ( sign date ) inform consent capable cooperate treatment follow . Exclusion criterion : 1 . Prior radiotherapy , immunotherapy , chemotherapy anticancer therapy ( exclude surgery ) current HNSCC . 2 . Patients exclude trial active previous malignancy type Investigator 's opinion would mean good candidate clinical trial . 3 . Female patient able become pregnant ( already pregnant lactate ) . However , patient negative serum urine pregnancy test enrolment agree use two highly effective form contraception ( oral ; inject implant hormonal contraception condom ; intra uterine device condom ; diaphragm spermicidal gel condom ) effective first administration AMG 319 , throughout trial 6 month afterwards consider eligible . 4 . Male patient partner child bear potential ( unless agree take measure father child use one form highly effective contraception [ condom plus spermicide ] effective first administration AMG 319 , throughout trial 6 month afterwards ) . Men pregnant lactate partner must advise use barrier method contraception ( example : condom plus spermicidal gel ) prevent exposure foetus neonate . 5 . Patients unable swallow oral medication ( trial medication must chew , crush , dissolve divide ) . 6 . Major thoracic abdominal surgery patient yet recover . 7 . At high medical risk non malignant systemic disease include active uncontrolled infection . 8 . Active uncontrolled auto immune disease may require systemic immunomodulator therapy trial treatment period . Exceptions atopic dermatitis psoriasis require systemic treatment . 9 . Long term use systemic corticosteroid exception replacement treatment . Discontinuation steroid use within seven day prior receive first dose AMG 319 placebo would acceptable . Inhaled topical steroid permit . 10 . Known serologically positive hepatitis B , hepatitis C human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . If clinical suspicion infection must rule appropriate serological PCR testing . 11 . QTc &gt; 470 msec ( Friderica [ QTc F ] correction ) history family history QT prolongation . 12 . Regular and/or prolong treatment medication know cause QTc interval prolongation within seven day prior receive first dose AMG 319 placebo . 13 . Is participant plan participate another interventional clinical trial , whilst take part Phase IIa trial AMG 319 . Participation observational trial interventional clinical trial involve administration IMP would acceptable . 14 . Any condition Investigator 's opinion would make patient good candidate clinical trial .</criteria>
