	<brief_summary>Our overall goal characterize role microcirculation heal oral mucosa routinely apply surgery intervention order facilitate treatment . Using Laser Speckle Contrast Analysis ( LASCA ) , provide blood perfusion data , investigator possibility detect functional alteration gingival microcirculation case wound heal . After periodontal surgery , mean detection microcirculation prognostic diagnostic factor , investigator follow-up healing procedure obtain data design e.g . incision line take microvascular anatomy account , thus result good wound healing later .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>In today 's periodontal plastic surgery numerous flap design various graft alternative ( auto-allo- xeno-grafts ) routinely apply . In order achieve uneventful primary intention heal allow graft integration result successful clinical outcome important apply optimized surgical technique suitable graft material address various clinical demand ( e.g . recession coverage , enlargement keratinize tissue , correction periimplant soft tissue deficiency ) . Graft exposure soft- hard tissue augmentation might occur chance graft vascularization due wound heal disturbance lack primary intention healing . The reason flap failure could compromise flap circulation , avoid proper flap design , tension free flap advancement . The role flap design gingival blood flow investigate surgery find simplify papilla preservation flap result faster recovery blood flow modify Widman flap surgery . In order minimize trauma surround tissue ( i.e . flap ) recommendable use least invasive method flap preparation , may also protect underline graft tissue support quick vascularization . These guideline lead develop minimal invasive flap design root coverage surgery , namely supraperiosteal envelope Tunnel technique , later modify Azzi et al . coronally advance mucogingival complex order cover insert graft . Later modify introduce microsurgical approach . The question still remain answered Tunnelling technique influence microcirculation heal gingiva underlie graft tissue affect overlie mucosal flap . Recently new non-invasive , two dimensional method , namely laser speckle contrast analysis ( LASCA ) introduce evaluate microcirculation tissue . Clinical pilot study suggest technique may useful tool assess proper circulation surgical intervention evaluate wound heal skin human . This new method may let u monitor entire surgical area real-time healing period .</detailed_description>
