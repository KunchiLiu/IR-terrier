	<brief_summary>Despite considerable advance cancer treatment , patient locally advanced lung cancer still face poor chance survival high risk experience serious , life threaten treatment-related side-effects . These side-effects poorly understood difficult measure : therefore challenge design new treatment strategy aim decrease treatment toxicity yet increase survival . At present , many patient present tumour large low palliative dose radiation therapy offer order keep risk side-effects acceptable level . In project , name INHALE , possibility irradiate lung cancer patient hold breath deep inspiration ( call : Deep inspiration breath hold , DIBH ) investigate . In DIBH , healthy lung tissue push away tumour , even large tumour present , high curative dose radiation therapy offer . This technique simple widely use treat breast cancer patient institution well centre world . If positive , result INHALE transfer easily minimal cost throughout Denmark rest world . DIBH sporadically use lung cancer patient date , assumption patient group , often poor performance status , could comply DIBH procedure . However , investigator ' experience show majority lung cancer patient comfortably hold short repeat DIBHs treatment session throughout eight week treatment course , even relatively poor lung function . The difference side-effects patient treat INHALE regimen large group patient previously treat institution thoroughly investigate , use follow-up CT image range clinical parameter . INHALE unique study combine use high level technology ensure high-quality treatment DIBH thorough scientific investigation follow-up data . INHALE provide improve understanding assess decrease treatment side-effects : consequently investigator aim test hypothesis large clinical trial order improve survival lung cancer patient .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Background Lung cancer remain major cause cancer morbidity mortality . In Denmark , incidence show slight , robust decrease last 10 year male , incidence female continue increase . The relative survival 5 year 11 % men 15 % woman . While surgery treatment choice early stage disease , radiotherapy combine chemotherapy treatment modality curative potential patient locally advance inoperable non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) . Unfortunately , overall survival remain poor loco-regional disease progression recurrences common . Clinical study indicate radiation dose response relationship , suggest high radiation dose would improve local control . However , recent randomized phase III trial RTOG0617 , standard-dose ( 60 Gy ) vs. high-dose ( 74 Gy ) concomitant chemo-radiotherapy overall survival low high-dose arm . While toxicity may explanation negative result RTOG0617 , increase rate high-grade toxicity 74 Gy arm certainly major concern : trial furthermore highlight limit current understanding mechanism treatment related toxicity limit attempt increase local control . Radiotherapy-related side effect severe , yet difficult ass quantify . CTC AE general golden standard tool measure adverse event . However , many patient heart lung relate comorbidity prior radiotherapy may difficult completely distinguish comorbidity treatment related toxicity , even reliable baseline data exist . The symptomatology pneumonitis correlate poorly radiological finding decline lung function . Radiation induce heart toxicity dispute group patient physiological response radiotherapy fully understood . Serious even lethal toxicity high dose radiation therapy underreported prospective trial , likely mechanisms time span toxicity different expect . A recent retrospective study13 describe positive correlation deliver treatment dose increase lung tissue density treatment , measure consecutive follow-up CT scan . No correlation clinical outcome make . In conclusion , understand radiation-induced pulmonary toxicity still limit . Reliable measure toxicity highly warranted order perform prospective trial improve therapeutic outcome lung cancer patient . In DIBH radiotherapy , patient hold breath image radiotherapy plan radiotherapy delivery . DIBH result profound anatomic change : tumour motion minimise , heart drawn downward lung inflate push healthy away target volume . DIBH standard treatment patient mediastinal Hodgkin lymphoma breast cancer . This technique simple , cost-efficient spare heart lung without detriment healthy organ target . However , lung tumour represent additional challenge mobile : daily position must assess reliably order avoid underdosing tumour overdose healthy lung The investigator recently perform pilot study base 17 lung cancer patient , find patient able maintain several consecutive deep inspiration breath hold 20 second throughout course radiotherapy . No correlation FEV1 value ability perform DIBH observe . The range FEV1 17 patient 1.2 - 3.2 litre ( 44-67 % predict value ) . The patient plan DIBH free breathing treat free breathing . DIBH plan result significantly low lung dose . However , previously observe select patient multiple target , DIBH best treatment option . This highlight importance full investigation potential benefit drawback DIBH lung cancer patient . The primary aim INHALE investigate feasibility deliver safe precise DIBH lung cancer radiotherapy . The secondary aim INHALE investigate potential DIBH lung cancer radiotherapy reduce treatment toxicity explore reliable logistically manageable toxicity endpoint . Key research question 1a . Is DIBH well tolerate lung cancer patient throughout treatment ? 1b . Can prescribe dose deliver accurately reproducibly target DIBH ? 1c . Is DIBH safe ? 1. d. What overall survival local progression free survival patient treat INHALE ? 2. . Is DIBH dosimetrically beneficial patient ? 2b . What extent dosimetric benefit DIBH ? 3a . Is possible measure radiation-induced lung damage ( RILD ) lung cancer patient pragmatic way ? 3b . Can image-based measure use assessment toxicity ? Methods INHALE primary feasibility study . It base prospective inclusion 80 patient locally advanced NSCLC treatment DIBH . All patient NSCLC refer concomitant sequential chemo-radiotherapy include INHALE . For secondary toxicity research question , historic cohort approximately 350 patient locally advance NSCLC treat concomitant sequential chemo-radiotherapy free breathe 2009-2014 used comparison . Treatment plan Imaging treatment planning perform accord local national guideline ( www.dolg.dk ) addition DIBH FDG PET/CT two consecutive DIBH CT scan measure reproducibility consecutive DIBHs . The DIBH FDG PET/CT acquire session conventional FDG PET/CT ( without additional use PET-tracer ) . Audio-visual respiratory coaching apply train patient hold breath comfortable reproducible inspiration level . Video goggles use plan treatment , treatment apply DIBH . Patients comply treatment DIBH treat free breathing register `` non compliant '' . For patient DIBH well free breathing plan calculate use volumetric modulate arc therapy technique , constraint accord national guideline . The plan low dose lung heart choose patient treatment . Treatment Patients treat conventional free breathing technique treat accord standard clinical procedure include daily set-up tumour position cone beam CT ( CBCT ) . Patients treat DIBH technique set-up DIBH CBCT , technique require 2-3 consecutive DIBHs . DIBH treatment deliver gate . In case patient loose ability perform DIBH treatment course , conventional free breathing plan apply remain treatment fraction patient register non-compliant . The daily position target volume monitor CBCT , assure precise delivery prescribe dose target ( ) . In case differential motion treatment target ( i.e . change spatial separation primary tumour relatively lymph node metastasis ) , image enable u decide whether proceed treatment re-scan patient adapt treatment plan accordingly . Follow-up Patients follow accord national guideline addition supplementary lung function test . Furthermore , patient ask contact department case pneumonitis symptom , i.e . dyspnoea , cough moderate fever . At control visit , medication , symptom hospital admission register . All heart lung relate diagnosis register participate patient follow-up period . Patients follow five year death . Safety In case toxicity grade 4 5 , patient history treatment plan review . If association treatment parameter suspect , treatment constraint prospectively adjust . Statistics The study primary feasibility study mainly descriptive statistic employ . With regard analysis frequency dosimetrical benefit DIBH , assume underlying benefit rate 75 % , width observe 95 % confidence interval base binomial statistic approximately 64 % -84 % . This sufficiently accurate estimate rate benefit DIBH initiate phase III trial engage centre prospective testing . For secondary research question several candidate toxicity endpoint test study power see difference candidate endpoint , choose endpoint apparent best discriminatory power phase III trial expect effective strategy ( 'pick winner ' analysis ) . However , potential statistical advantage balance medical priority . In way maximum knowledge data gain enable basis formulate well-founded hypothesis future study field . Statistical analysis plan The resulting toxicity DIBH compare historical cohort encompass approximately 350 patient treat 2009-2014 free breathing investigator ' institution . A Cox proportional hazard model predict risk RILD generate . We expect model involve performance status , smoke status , tumour size -location predictor , analysis base model reduction technique use backwards elimination , possibly assist forced entry . The result Cox model use generate expect freedom RILD curve . The predicted freedom RILD compare observe Kaplan Meier curve trial patient . The relative risk RILD ( observe vs. expect ) extract . Bootstrap resampling publish method use SAS software obtain confidence band expect outcome curve . Comparison historic cohort make `` intention treat '' analysis . The historic cohort identify database collect project already approve Danish Board Health ( sagsnr . 3-3013-569/1/ ) Danish Data Protection Agency ( jour.nr . 30-1178 ) administer Lotte Nygård . Perspectives It expect one toxicity endpoints INHALE solid enough serve primary endpoint phase III trial optimize radiotherapy locally advance NSCLC , enable radiotherapy society gain solid evidence use emerge technology . Furthermore , DIHB hold potential synergetic combination new principle , e.g . dose paint boost radio-resistant area tumour , technique require tumour motion minimal order deliver dose correctly .</detailed_description>
