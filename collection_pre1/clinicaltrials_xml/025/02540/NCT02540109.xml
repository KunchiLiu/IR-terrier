	<brief_summary>This Phase II study aim ascertain effectiveness HD-tDCS adjunctive treatment anomia chronic aphasia post stroke . Furthermore , help explore factor alternate outcome measure , subject selection criterion , benefit extend treatment duration . These result compare exist trial use conventional non-targeted tDCS design outcome . Patients treat HD-tDCS perform computerized anomia treatment . The basis behind method language therapy mediate cortical area effectively activate training task , thus increase electric stimulation area may improve learn outcomes . To good understand long term benefit adjunctive treatment , patient screen four week six month study use anomia test . If HD-tDCS show promise result increase learn outcome anomia treatment , Phase III trial consider .</brief_summary>
