	<brief_summary>The aim study address exploratory endpoint Major Extremity Trauma Research Consortium ( METRC ) Transtibial Amputation Outcomes Study ( TAOS ; NCT01821976 ) investigate prosthesis fit , alignment condition residual limb . As validated measure fit alignment ( factor know impact comfort , function performance among amputee ) TAOS study include provision protocol acquisition photograph , video radiograph order help develop uniform assessment residual limb . The goal ProFit study validate refine prosthetic assessment tool ( ProFit ) develop expert panel certify orthotist prosthetistis ( CPOs ) collaboration orthopaedic trauma investigator , measurement scientist biomedical engineer BADER consortium .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Specific Aim 1 : To test reliability ProFit . Patients enrol TAOS trial return eighteen month final visit undergo radiographic , video , photographic assessment . A blinded prosthetist panel ( PP ) view remotely complete 42 item assessment base x-ray , photo video . We examine two aspect reliability ProFit , inter-rater reliability internal consistency . Specific Aim 2 : To examine validity responsiveness ProFit . This study aim examine validity ProFit specifically evaluate factor validity , construct validity discriminant validity . This accomplished correlating ProFit score measure self-reported pain ( Brief Pain Inventory ) , function ( Short Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment ) , satisfaction ( Orthotics Prosthetics User 's Survey ) . Moreover , subset subject undergo quantitative measurement fit alignment use novel prosthesis-mounted socket reaction moment sensor . Responsiveness ProFit base repeat measurement 6 18 month . Specific Aim 3 : To develop short version ProFit . Based finding Aim 1 2 individual item level , remove item : 1 ) poor inter-rater agreement ; 2 ) demonstrate weak relationship clinician patient report overall fit ; 3 ) exhibit strong ceiling floor effect . Study design : The ProFit study prospective validation study assessment prosthetic fit alignment among patient transtibial amputation . Study duration : 3 year Sample size : 120 TAOS patient provide adequate power detect important difference fit alignment 18 month follow amputation . A subset 60 patient necessary detect significant difference alignment use Smart Pyramid . Number study site : Up 35 center include 24 Core METRC sit , 4 MTFs , 7 METRC satellite site . Study population : Patients enrol METRC TAOS study . Outcome measure : This ancillary project TAOS trial design study validity reliability validity ProFit , 42-item tool assess prosthetic fit alignment among patient transtibial amputation . Statistical analysis : Inter-rater reliability internal consistency examine test reliability ProFit . The validity assessment evaluate use variety construct validity test . Based finding reliability validity analysis , short version ProFit develop . The performance short version determine base correlation original assessment . Randomization : Not applicable Safety monitoring : Not applicable</detailed_description>
