	<brief_summary>The investigator extract single cell analyze molecular composition single cell well bulk use late protocol single cell bulk genomics analyse include genetic , epigenetic , transcriptomic proteomic analysis use late available protocol . A broad list example protocol list . The sample molecular characterization ( include sequence &amp; molecular level ) serve basis development method single cell analysis . The developed method aim genomic transcriptomic , epigenetic , proteomics analysis single cell share structure : measured feature translate DNA library represent feature dedicate assay . This library alongside proper mathematical analysis sequence result perform order conclude desired feature . The general structure protocol describe review paper ( Single-cell sequencing-based technology revolutionize whole-organism science , E. Shapiro , T. Biezuner &amp; S.Linnarsson , Nature Reviews Genetics 14 , 618-630 , 2013 ) attach proposal . In addition , researcher use sequence base method ( exist future develop ) order compare single cell bulk different tissue and/or different time point donor order measure genetic , epigenetic , transcriptomic , proteomic diversity .</brief_summary>
