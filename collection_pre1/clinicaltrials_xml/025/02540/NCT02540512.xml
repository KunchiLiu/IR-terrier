	<detailed_description>All Emergency Department physicians willing participate study train Battlefield Acupuncture Protocol weekend workshop training . The acupuncture protocol training taught consult expert acupuncturists extensive train clinical experience protocol . The acupuncturists available throughout duration study consultant physician time question treatment and/or protocol . Patients present Emergency Department meet inclusion exclusion criterion willing participate study , screen triaged appropriately , meet inclusion exclusion criterion study , give proper inform consent randomize three separate group : 1 . Standard medical group ( tape ear + standard medical drug ) 2 . Standard medical group plus auricular acupuncture ( acupuncture + standard medical drug ) 3 . Auricular acupuncture group ( acupuncture + placebo pill ) Each group appearance get treatment , participant inform prior treatment group could possibly . This single blind study additional consideration well limit bias . Prior treatment , physician inform patient step utilized procedure . In attempt limit bias much possible , physician know treatment group patient place prior performing treatment . The standard medical drug use study hydrocodone / acetaminophen 5mg/325mg ( Norco generic ) . This single-blind study extra consideration limit bias . After inform patient procedure prior perform treatment , physician present box contain supply need application treatment . Each box contain supply one three group list , open box , physician perform appropriate treatment . The physician know whether patient receive standard medical drug placebo pill . The physician know type acupuncture procedure perform patient . Richard C. Niemtzow , MD , PhD , MPH originator developer Battlefield Acupuncture protocol technique , initiate use protocol great success military . Dr. Niemtzow also proven great success treat pain protocol similar research study past . The investigational protocol device test study The Battlefield Acupuncture Protocol , use Gold Titanium French Aiguille Semi-Permanent ( ASP ) needle . The French ASP速 needle small , single-use , disposable needle design stay ear several day fall . The ASP needle small needle house within small plastic injector allow acupuncturist insert needle rapid manner decrease discomfort . ASP needle intend single use manufacture sterile environment . After appropriate needle place , ASP needle cover small adhesive patch keep needle securely place prevent contamination . The needle usually remain ear approximately 4 6 day fall . Following Battlefield Acupuncture Protocol , patient acupuncture group receive auricular acupuncture medical acupuncturists use sterile ASP速 needle ( SEDATELEC ; Lyon , France bilaterally sequence outline : 1 . Cingulate Gyrus 2 . Thalamus 3 . Omega 2 4 . Point Zero 5 . Shen Men Appropriate asepsis technique use clean acupuncture point prior treatment . After placement needle placement next needle , patient instruct walk thirty foot . If patient unable walk , instruct move arm thirty second . If patient experience significant drop pain level ( 0 1 ) placement needle specific point subsequent movement , needle insert . If patient still pain , procedure repeat appropriate acupuncture sit utilized . Here quick breakdown step perform Battlefield Acupuncture Protocol : 1 . Assess patient 's pain level use VAS score ( 0-10 ) . 2 . Insert one needle Point 1 ( cingulate gyrus ) 3 . Instruct patient walk 30 second . If patient unable walk , instruct move arm 30 second . 4 . Reassess patient 's pain level . If patient experience significant drop pain ( 0 1 ) , needles insert . 5 . If pain significantly drop , next needle insert point opposite ear Step 3 repeat . 6 . If insertion needle completion Step 3 patient experience drop pain significant ( 0-1 ) , sequence needle continue ear patient drop pain pain level 0-1 . This call `` dominant ear '' . Gold ASP速 needle prefer needle choice protocol , however , patient MRI perform within next week , titanium ASP速 needle use instead interfere MRI scan . The patient instruct leave needle tape ear next 48 hour , touch , allow needle fall . Prior leave Emergency Department treatment , patient schedule follow-up appointment 48 hour later conduct Loma Linda University Clinical Trial Center acupuncture needle remove , last pain assessment perform , patient fill past trauma history questionnaire . The patient ask series short question regard pain level recent painkiller use ask fill questionnaire past trauma history : Questionnaires : Patients pain level ( utilizing VAS pain score scale 0-10 ) recent painkiller use assess four time study , prior leave , patient give medication diary track use painkiller follow 48 hour treatment . 1 . Prior treatment ( person time triage ) 2 . Immediately treatment ( patient fill form drop box prior leave ) 3 . 24 hour treatment ( phone call ) 4 . 48 hour treatment ( person interview Loma Linda University Clinical Trial Center ) Patients also ask fill questionnaire regard past trauma history ( see attach questionnaire ) . The data collect study follow : 1 . Demographic information , 2 . Pain medication use , 3 . Pain level , 4 . Number acupuncture needle use treatment ( acupuncture group ) , 5 . Past trauma history questionnaire . 1 . The patient fill form provide demographic data initial screening . 2 . During initial analysis , patient ask much pain medication typically use per day . After treatment , patient give medication diary record pain medication use next two day . The medication use data diary collect phone interview perform study collaborator . 3 . The pain level scoring system use study Visual Analog Scale ( VAS ) pain score scale 1-10 . The triage nurse perform initial recording time triage . The patient second record immediately treatment fill form drop box prior leave treatment area . The third fourth pain recording perform one study collaborator contact patient follow interview phone . 4 . For patient acupuncture group , physician record number location acupuncture needle use illicit positive response patient patient 's chart . Data Analysis We compare baseline characteristic four treatment group use X2 test categorical variable independent test analyse continuous variable . We perform series test look difference group number relevant baseline variable , include demographic information , intensity pain , number needle use ( acupuncture group ) . If distribution four individual pain score fairly normal , assess change pain level baseline follow-up use independent test . We run nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test well see whether consistent result reach independent , parametric test . If conclusion reach test , assess outcome measure pain administered baseline , immediately treatment , 24-hours treatment , 48-hours treatment use independent test analysis intention-to-treat principle . We calculate effect size take difference mean change pain intervention group standard care group divide SD change score total population . Risks Benefits This first study conduct test use ASP needle treatment management pain , ASP needle approve use FDA . The potential minor risk measure minimize risk follow : 1 . There minor risk patient placebo group experience relief pain . Subjects make aware potential risk prior give inform consent . This risk minor subject hemodynamically stable part inclusion criterion , opportunity withdraw study time wish , physician nurse pull patient study deem medically necessary , study 48 hour duration cause long-term pain suffer person placebo group . 2 . Side effect : The common serious side effect acupuncture needle site pain infection . Acupuncturists use proper asepsis technique prior treatment , sterile needle use . In case infection pain , patient opportunity come back hospital needle remove treated infection . 3 . Minor confidentiality risk : All subject data keep confidential manage high security . Only study collaborator access patient data , data remain locked file shred use . Auricular Acupuncture potential provide safe , fast , effective treatment million people suffer pain worldwide . This study potential prove auricular acupuncture acceptable alternative and/or adjunct treatment tool healthcare provider use ease suffering people pain . This study also potential prove auricular acupuncture effective tool reduce use dependency narcotic pain medication . There benefit utilized study .
