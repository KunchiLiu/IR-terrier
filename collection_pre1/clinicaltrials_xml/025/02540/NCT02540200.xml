	<brief_summary>Hip pain young patient difficult diagnose treat . However , advance image technique surgical method , investigator able identify hip cartilage lesion cause hip pain . MR ( magnetic resonance ) arthrography best image modality diagnose chondral lesion hip , occasionally miss pathology , thus necessitate accurate invasive mean diagnosis . Consequently , hip arthroscopy increasingly used diagnosis treatment hip cartilage pathology . Microfracture mean stimulate bone marrow , standard treatment small chondral lesion . This procedure show result excellent functional anatomical outcome . Microfracture recognize standard treatment cartilage lesion knee , recently indication technique extend hip pathology . The BST-CarGel device ( Piramal Life Sciences , Bio-Orthopaedic Division ) base patented technology cartilage repair . BST-Gel comprise buffer beta-glycerophosphate chitosan , well-studied natural material biocompatible appropriate use scaffold assist cartilage repair . BST-Gel mixed patient 's whole blood deliver surgically prepared cartilage lesion conjunction bone marrow stimulation . The BST-CarGel/blood mixture solidifies cartilage lesion provide three-dimensional scaffold repair process . This product show result superior chondral lesion repair compare bone marrow stimulation alone . The current study collect data standard care practice BST-CarGel conjunction bone marrow stimulation technique use treatment focal cartilage lesion hip . In addition , patient study group compare group patient undergo bone marrow stimulation technique alone . The efficacy BST-CarGel conjunction microfracture cartilage lesion knee show previous study . Additional research require expand knowledge develop treatment guideline treatment cartilage lesion hip use BST-CarGel . As BST-CarGel improves result bone marrow stimulation technique without increase risk procedure , device beneficial case cartilage lesion hip .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Osteoarthritis hip disable condition lead tremendous burden patient society . It difficult pinpoint cause osteoarthritis case think multifactorial , genetic , biomechanical , structural morphological factor main contributor . Early identification intervention osteoarthritic hip challenge due lack accurate diagnostic tool effective method intervention . However , recent advancement image modality MR arthrography increase use arthroscopy result early identification acetabular labral pathology may contribute development osteoarthritis . Femoroacetabular impingement ( FAI ) condition abnormally shape hip cause impingement symptom functional range hip , lead labral pathology . Consequently , FAI significant contributor development hip osteoarthritis . However , diagnosis FAI often challenge patient present impingement symptom without clear radiographic sign . Hip arthroscopy , therefore , remain gold standard diagnose chondral lesion allow direct visualization . Consequently , young patient hip pain without radiographic evidence would often undergo arthroscopy hip , identify underlie pathology also provide tool treat problem . Microfracture standard treatment small chondral defect excellent result low complication rate . This procedure lead attraction undifferentiated stem cell chondral defect . These cell stabilize marrow clot differentiate stable fibrocartilaginous tissue . This technique study much extensively knee hip , excellent short-term long-term result . Microfracture show result well functional outcome compare autologous chondrocyte implantation , equivalent histological outcome . Success technique knee lead application technique hip joint excellent result . Philippon colleague follow nine patient full-thickness chondral defect underwent microfracture via hip arthroscopy . Eight patient 95 % 100 % coverage chondral defect see second look revision hip arthroscopy . In addition , study Karthikeyan colleague show 19 20 patient average fill 96 % chondral defect treat microfracture . Several study show anatomic restoration translate functional improvement well . McDonald colleague show professional hockey player underwent microfracture Outerbridge grade IV chondral lesion able return competitive game without statistically significant decrease performance compare match control cohort . In addition , study Domb colleague show significant improvement patient-reported outcome two year follow-ups patient underwent arthroscopic hip surgery microfracture procedure . This successful transition set precedent adapt effective technique tool use knee treat hip pathology . However , bone marrow stimulate technique alone perfect solution focal chondral defect , various technique device utilized improve efficacy current bone marrow stimulate technique . Recently , gel-forming biopolymer gain interest scaffold material inject site microfracture stabilize clot facilitate cartilage repair . Chitosan natural polysaccharide compose D-glucosamine N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residue , biocompatible biodegradable . It also pH-dependent remain dissolved solution pH 6.2 , form hydrate gel-like precipitate pH exceed 6.2 . Chitosan also remain liquid room temperature solidify gel-like state body temperature , make excellent injectable material . It study extensively effective scaffold biomaterial low toxicity great adhesiveness tissue . BST-CarGel ( Piramal Life Sciences , Bio-Orthopaedic Division ) injectable chitosan-based medical device design use conjunction bone marrow stimulation technique . It comprise buffer β-glycerophosphate chitosan , liquid state room temperature . It miss patient ' untreated whole blood , deliver surgically prepared cartilage lesion microfracture already perform . The BST-CarGel blood mixture solidify cartilage defect form three-dimensional scaffold repair process stabilize clot cartilage lesion via adhesion inhibition clot retraction . The result gel implant facilitate body 's healing response , potentially enhance residency wound heal factor find blood along bone marrow-derived cell . The safety efficacy BST-CarGel treat chondral lesion femoral condyle show well-designed randomized , control trial Stanish colleague . In study , BST-CarGel treatment conjunction conventional bone marrow stimulation technique superior microfracture alone term lesion fill 12 month period , equivalent clinical benefit safety profile . The superiority cartilage repair may imply improved long-term clinical outcome although study require establish correlation . BST-CarGel receive European CE ( Conformité Européenne ) mark approval extend indication use synovial joint Europe , although clinical research joint limit . BST-CarGel optimize result bone marrow stimulation , demonstrate previous clinical result , without increase inherent risk type procedure . Therefore , BST-CarGel could beneficial case chondral lesion hip . In addition , purpose treatment chondral lesion anatomic restoration defect mainly improvement clinical symptom . The conventional bone marrow stimulation technique via microfracture show improve patient ' functional outcome . The visual analogue scale ( VAS ) simple valid tool widely used evaluate patient ' pain . In addition , several questionnaire specifically design hip pain . Non-arthritic hip score ( NAHS ) proven valid tool without floor ceiling effect measure disability non-arthritic hip pathology . International hip outcome score ( iHOT ) valid tool measure patient-reported quality life score . The original questionnaire include 33 item show valid reliable .</detailed_description>
