	<brief_title>CRC Screening Using mSEPT9 ( Methylated Septin 9 ) Chinese Population</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 . Background Colorectal cancer ( CRC ) third common malignancy gastrointestinal system . Regular screening , early detection early treatment colorectal cancer achieve good prevention even cure . Currently , 60 % -70 % CRC patient diagnose late stage 11.8 % case detect early stage . It therefore urgent reduce CRC mortality improve early screening rate . In China , fecal occult blood test ( FOBT ) colonoscopy available presently early CRC screening . FOBT widely use due low cost non-invasiveness , however , false positive rate relatively high due many interfere factor . The advance FOBT , fecal immunochemical test ( FIT ) , greatly improve test specificity compare traditional chemical method compliance high , still subject influence intestinal disease , lead low positive predictive value . In contrast , compliance colonoscopy low due invasiveness , cost risk complication . In recent year , plasma-based SEPT9 gene methylation assay prove promising method early detection CRC . Many clinical study demonstrate methylated SEPT9 gene useful biomarker early CRC detection.At present , Epigenomics ' Epi proColon 2.0 CE commercialize assay SEPT9 gene methylation globally . This product obtain approval European Union CE certification , Chinese FDA Argentina FDA . It complete key clinical data submission US FDA , reasonable expectation US FDA approval soon . Services base SEPT9 gene methylation assay also provide clinical laboratory quest , Arup , companion DX gamma dynacare common medical procedure code ( CPT code ) 81401 . In China , BioChain ( Beijing ) Science Technology , Inc , strong partner Epigenomics AG , develop SEPT9 gene methylation assay agreement Epigenomics AG . 2 . Estimation sample size Based equation N=Z2* ( P ( 1-p ) ) /E2 know positivity detection rate , investigator calculate number sample need trial , N represent sample size , Z statistical parameter ( Z=1.96 95 % confidence interval ) ; E represent error ( 5 % choose study ) , P represent probability ( putative positive detection rate ) . The investigator choose 0.75 P value base exist literature SEPT9 sensitivity . The number CRC case calculate 288 base equation . The investigator aim collect complete information 300 case due information incompleteness track loss . etc . Based estimation CRC account 30 % high-risk outpatient inpatient Chinese hospital , total number patient trial less 1000 case . The investigator aim recruit 1200 case trial take account 20 % loss follow-up rate . The final actual number case trial 1031 , due loss tracking , incomplete test clinical data , sample meet test criterion . 3 . Subject group All patient group blood draw SEPT9 assay , blood sample obtain subject meet selection criterion . All technician blind clinical information subject . In order investigate feasibility joint detection SEPT9 assay screen test , carcino-embryonic antigen ( CEA ) FIT test perform participate patient judgment physician . This part data use retrospective analysis completion trial . When planned test finish , subject divide three group base colonoscopy diagnosis pathology , CRC group , precancerous disease group disease group , CRC group consist patient stage 0-IV CRC , precancerous disease group include patient adenoma polyp , disease group include patient bowel disease , cancer , subject evidence disease . 4 . Trial procedure Training finish trial start include operation procedure assay use kit instrument . This trial randomize , single-blind study . All patient sign inform consent blood draw 10ml . Samples process SEPT9 assay perform base instruction user . All subject receive colonoscopy and/or pathological examination confirm diagnosis , result SEPT9 assay decide base instruction user . Statistical analysis perform base result SEPT9 assay colonoscopy and/or pathological examination . 5 . Sample collection storage 1 ) sample collection : 1. sample collect outpatient inpatient sample information record sample collection form . 2. sample collection : 10 mL peripheral blood ( K2EDTA decoagulant ) . 3. order ensure accuracy assay , sample collection perform strictly base requirement , otherwise may affect accuracy assay . 2 ) sample storage transportation method : Store transfer sample base instruction use kit 6 , SEPT9 assay SEPT9 gene methylation assay ( PCR fluorescence probe method ) compose two step . Firstly , cell-free DNA plasma extract use plasma processing kit , follow bisulfite conversion , unmethylated cytosine convert methylated cytosine . Secondly , real-time PCR use bisulfite-converted DNA ( bisDNA ) template perform determine amplification template . PCR block agent methylation-specific probe work together distinguish methylated unmethylated DNA . Beta-actin use internal control evaluate plasma DNA quality validity PCR amplification . Positive negative control provide kit quality control run parallel samples time . 7 , Data analysis statistic The data SEPT9 assay data colonoscopy subject collect analyzed , follow parameter calculate : Sensitivity Specificity Consistency positive predictive value ( PPV ) negative predictive value ( NPV ) 8 , Ethics The budget plan clinical trial submit ethic committee participate hospital review clinical trial start . The study initiate unless approval committee . All subject sign inform consent blood collection , inform usage plasma test result . 9 , Research progress 2014.02-2014.04 Confirmation clinical trial protocol train personnel sample collection test 2014.04-2014.08 Submission clinical trial application ethic committee approval four hospital 2014.08-2015.04 Start patient recruitment collection general information subject 2014.10-2015.04 Sample collection test 2015.04-2015.07 Collect track colonoscopy and/or pathology information 2015.07-2015.09 Data processing , statistic analysis 2015.10 Close patient recruitment finish trial 10 , Budget The cost include expense recruit 1200 subject , equipment rent charge , test material cost , sample processing fee , labor cost , patient compensation cost , travel conference cost , publication intellectual property ( IP ) fee . All expense cover BioChain , trial initiate organize BioChain . 11 , Publication intellectual property 1. plan publish 2-3 paper science citation index ( SCI ) -indexed journal , 3-4 paper Chinese domestic core journal . 2. plan submit one patent 12 , Data management Quality clinical trial data basis evaluation result . To ensure reality reliability experiment result , investigator set series data management principle . The investigator explain data management principle study thoroughly follow composition responsibility Data Management Committee content data management . 13.Research team personnel In order avoid possible error cause difference disease incidence ratio patient different hospital , four hospital Beijing chosen patient recruitment clinical trial . Since patient four hospital mainly northern China , study population representative disease epidemiology part country . Doctors technicians department gastrointestinal disease , endoscopy general surgery four hospital participate trial , : Peking Union Medical College Hospital ( Beijing ) Beijing Military General Hospital ( Beijing ) Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy Medical Sciences ( Beijing ) Beijing Cancer Hospital ( Beijing )</detailed_description>
