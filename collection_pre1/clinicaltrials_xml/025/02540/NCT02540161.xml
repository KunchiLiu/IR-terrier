	<brief_title>Phase 2 Study Sym004 Adult Patients With Recurrent Glioblastoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The purpose study assess activity Sym004 , recombinant antibody mixture specifically bind EGFR , patient diagnose recurrent glioblastoma whose tumor EGFR amplify . The primary objective ass activity Sym004 patient recurrent glioblastoma either non bevacizumab failure ( Cohort 1 ) previously fail bevacizumab ( Cohort 2 ) , term 6-month progression-free survival ( PFS6 ) . Secondary objective include : 1 . Determine safety Sym004 recurrent Glioblastoma Multiforme ( GBM ) patient ; 2 . Estimate response rate ( RR ) within two cohort recurrent GBM patient ; 3 . Describe overall survival ( OS ) within two cohort recurrent GBM patient ; 4 . Describe overall median progress free survival ( PFS ) within two cohort recurrent GBM patient . This phase 2 study accrue total 61 patient WHO grade IV recurrent malignant glioma ( glioblastoma gliosarcoma ) two cohort ass efficacy Sym004 . Both cohort accrue simultaneously , 36 subject Cohort 1 25 subject Cohort 2 . Sym004 dose 18 mg/kg intravenously every 2 week . A treatment cycle 4 week . For primary objective , progression free survival , base upon Kaplan-Meier estimator , percentage patient alive progression-free 6 month initiation Sym004 treatment estimate . For secondary objective , within cohort , percentage patient experience grade 3 , 4 , 5 adverse event possibly , probably , definitely relate protocol treatment estimate . Second , within cohort , radiographic response rate estimate percentage treat patient complete partial response . An exact binomial confidence interval generate . Interim analyse focus physiologic consequence Sym004 treatment conduct 19 total patient across cohort treat Sym004 . The likely risk include skin reaction , electrolyte imbalance ( especially low Mg , Ca , K ) , diarrhea , generalized weakness , secondary skin nail infection , nausea vomiting , infusion-treated hypersensitivity reaction , inflammation mucous membrane .</detailed_description>
