	<brief_title>FCR APL LRTI - A Single Surgeon Randomized Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Trapeziometacarpal osteoarthritis ( TMC OA ) great societal burden . Its prevalence report high 36 % select population , directly responsible reduce work productivity absenteeism many case . In 1949 Gervis originally describe simply remove offend bone , trapezium , trapeziectomy since show favorable outcome . Many others subsequently publish similar clinical result technique . However , note trapeziectomy alone risk metacarpal subsidence trapezial fossa time , may impact patient outcome . This observation impetus development several complex surgical intervention TMC OA . A recent Cochrane review investigate literature available compare seven surgical intervention TMC OA . There significant difference discover , ultimately identify single procedure superior . The included study however note low quality , author call robust trial standardize outcome measure . One popular technique review trapeziectomy ligament reconstruction tendon interposition ( LRTI ) . First describe Eaton Littler , meet widespread adoption , show good result . It theoretically reconstruct ligament responsible maintain metacarpal 's position , also place tendon interpose two bone ( scaphoid base first metacarpal ) thus limit collapse . The commonly used tendon reconstruction volar beak ligament flexor carpus radialis ( FCR ) , recent report also advocate use abductor pollicis longus ( APL ) . The APL tendon already insert onto base first metacarpal , obviate need create bone tunnel , require use FCR . It also harvest without need additional incision . Only one study directly compare two procedure , result similar . Based available literature , trapeziectomy LRTI may confer minor advantage simple trapeziectomy . Currently , surgeon institution unanimously prefer LRTI procedure , however discord tendon best suit reconstruction . We hypothesize complication similar two procedure , DASH score operative time significantly decrease use APL tendon reconstruction .</detailed_description>
