	<brief_summary>A pilot study investigator group suggest prevalence chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) among dairy farmer higher general population . Most characteristic COPD dairy farmer ( smoke habit , dyspnoea , quality life , lung function , bronchial exhale nitric oxide , systemic inflammation , arterial stiffness exercise capacity ) largely unknown . Although immunization organic dust suspect , pathophysiology COPD dairy farmer also unknown . This study therefore aim ( ) compare prevalence COPD dairy farmer subject without occupational exposure ( control arm ) vast COPD detection program Franche-Comté region ; ( ii ) compare several characteristic ( smoke habit , dyspnoea , quality life , lung function , bronchial exhale nitric oxide , systemic inflammation , arterial stiffness exercise capacity ) dairy farmer COPD patient COPD without occupational exposure ; ( iv ) identify etiological factor COPD dairy farmer ( comparison exposure specific immunoglobulin E dairy farmer COPD dairy farmer normal pulmonary function test ) ; ( v ) constitute cohort COPD patient control subject longitudinal study . Data select patient ( either current former smoker ) mild COPD match control also analyze ancillary study objective compare exercise tolerance , ventilatory constraint tidal volume expansion dyspnoea asymptomatic mild COPD subject , symptomatic mild COPD healthy control .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>2000 dairy worker 2000 subject without occupational exposure , age 40 74 year , take part COPD screen program ( spirometry bronchodilation test ) September 2011 October 2014 . Subjects COPD healthy match control attend second visit . If need , COPD subject ask stop respiratory related medication short long act bronchodilator 72 hour prior visit . All subject complete several questionnaire ( quality life , respiratory symptom , smoke habit , … ) . A complete medical history collect , blood sample take . Subjects thereafter complete arterial stiffness measurement , exhale nitric oxide pulmonary function test pre- 30-min post-bronchodilator . A symptom-limited incremental cycle exercise test perform day , least 6 hour bronchodilator test least 4 hour meal . Exposure organic dust quantify analyze electrostatic wipe leave subject ' home 10 week .</detailed_description>
