	<brief_summary>The aim recruitment plan ( ADAPT-Enrich ) collect image technical data digital breast tomosynthesis ( DBT ) full-field digital mammography ( FFDM ) , along subject data include histology result biopsy specimen examination cancer classification data initially asymptomatic woman refer clinically indicate breast biopsy base suspicious DBT screen breast imaging result . These data include subsequent prospectively plan pool analysis describe separate protocol ( ADAPT-BIE ) examine superiority DBT FFDM breast cancer diagnosis performance measure .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Diagnostic Accuracy Performance Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Compared Mammography</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>ADAPT-ENRICH supplement on-going program ( ADAPT ) consist 2 additional recruitment plan ( ADAPT-SCR ADAPT-BX ) follow off-line read image data collect ( ADAPT-BIE ) . This study involve comparison two device identify abnormality routine breast screening diagnostic mammography . Mammography usually do full-field digital mammography ( FFDM ) , take flat , two-dimensional X-ray image breast . Doctors use two-dimensional image look cancer abnormal tissue . The purpose study learn accuracy full-field digital mammography device new mammography device call digital breast tomosynthesis ( DBT ) . DBT similar full-field digital mammography , also move around breast get X-ray image different angle , provide three-dimensional view doctor use look cancer abnormal tissue . Subjects recruit initially asymptomatic population refer clinically indicate breast biopsy base suspicious DBT screen breast imaging result . Subjects undergo DBT mammogram prior biopsy . If FFDM perform within 30 day , subject also undergo FFDM prior biopsy . Results biopsy ( y ) histopathology , include lesion characteristic , record consider truth positive cancer status . Subjects negative benign histological finding follow approximately one year ( 10-16 month ) FFDM additional standard care practice .</detailed_description>
