	<brief_summary>This study plan learn fluorescein intraoperative Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) good intraoperative MRI ( iMRI ) alone detect presence tumor tissue surgery . Both fluorescein intraoperative MRI study routinely use aid neurosurgeon distinguish normal brain tumor , help neurosurgeon safely resect tumor tissue surgery . This study enroll patient malignant high grade glioma go surgery remove brain tumor . For half patient , fluorescein intraoperative MRI use together surgery . For half patient , intraoperative MRI use surgery . iMRI use final verification complete , safe resection arm .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Fluorescein vs. iMRI Resection Malignant High Grade Glioma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Extent surgical resection malignant high grade glioma establish one important predictor overall survival six-month progression free survival . Unfortunately , often difficult surgery distinguish tumor normal brain . Various technology develop help surgeon readily safely increase extent resection order achieve improve survival glioblastoma resection . Fluorescein use institution number year improve visualization high-grade glioma enable good resection . Intraoperative MRI also develop similar intent , allow patient image intraoperatively determine extent resection need resection prior leave operating room . While evidence technology improve extent resection comparison historical control , never test prospective fashion . Intraoperative MRI significant cost significantly increase operative time . Fluorescein inexpensive injectable agent , good achieve gross total resection intraoperative MRI , would offer patient similar surgical outcome less anesthetic time cost intraoperative MRI . This study aim investigate value fluorescein intraoperative MRI malignant glioma patient ' extent tumor resection prospectively randomized manner .</detailed_description>
