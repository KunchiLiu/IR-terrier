	<brief_title>The Research Standard Diagnosis Treatment Severe HSP Children</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Henoch-Schonlein purpura ( HSP ) systemic vasculitis affect small vessel immunoglobulin A ( IgA ) -dominant immune deposit . The clinical manifestation severe HSP vary massive hemorrhage necrosis skin severe gastrointestinal symptom . The course disease would encounter delay relapse . To extent , traditional therapy alleviate clinical symptom , fail timely clear immune deposition , cause damage kidney . In study , patient give dexamethasone 0.5mg/kg/d , randomise receive either gamma globulin i.v . hemoperfusion disease ca n't control steroid treatment two day . The investigator explore biological marker compare efficacy safety measure treatment serve HSP child . The purpose study optimize treatment severe HSP child different age .</detailed_description>
