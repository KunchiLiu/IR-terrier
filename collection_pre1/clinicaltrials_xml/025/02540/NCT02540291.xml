	<criteria>1 . Age great equal 18 year 2 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) Performance Status 0 1 3 . Life expectancy great equal 12 week 4 . Participants must follow tumor type , confirm available pathology record current biopsy , advance , nonresectable , recurrent progressing since last antitumor therapy , alternative standard therapy exist : pancreatic adenocarcinoma , renal clear cell carcinoma , SCCHN ( squamous cell carcinoma head neck ) , NSCLC ( nonsmall cell lung cancer ) , colorectal cancer ( CRC ) , hepatocellular carcinoma ( HCC ) , ovarian serous epithelial cancer , bladder transitional cancer , cervical cancer , triplenegative breast cancer 5 . Prior chemotherapy immunotherapy ( tumor vaccine , cytokine , growth factor give control cancer ) must complete least 4 week study drug administration , adverse event ( AEs ) either return baseline stabilize 6 . Prior definitive radiation therapy must complete least 6 week study drug administration irradiate lesion show evidence progression intend consider target lesion . Prior palliative radiotherapy must complete least 2 week study drug administration . The radiotherapyrelated side effect must resolve study entry . No radiopharmaceutical ( strontium , samarium ) allow within 8 week study drug administration . 7 . Participants must accessible tumor consent repeat biopsy performance correlative tissue study 8 . Must least one measurable lesion per irRECIST ( immunerelated Response Evaluation Criteria Criteria Solid Tumors ) : At least 1 lesion great equal 10 mm long diameter nonlymph node great equal 15 mm shortaxis diameter lymph node serially measurable accord irRECIST use computerized tomography/magnetic resonance imaging ( CT/MRI ) Lesions definitive external beam radiotherapy locoregional therapy radiofrequency ( RF ) ablation brachytherapy must show evidence progressive disease deem target lesion 9 . Prior treat brain meningeal metastasis must without evidence progression ( confirm MRI ) least 8 week immunosuppressive dos systemic steroid ( great 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent ) least 4 week study drug administration 10 . Immunosuppressive dos systemic medication , steroid absorb topical steroid ( dos great 7.5 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent ) must discontinue least 2 week study drug administration . 11 . Participants prior Hepatitis B C eligible condition participant adequate liver function define Inclusion Criterion number 16 Exclusion Criterion number 5 12 . Left ventricular ejection fraction ( LVEF ) great 50 % echocardiography multiple gated acquisition ( MUGA ) scan 13 . Adequate renal function define serum creatinine le 1.5 X ULN ( upper limit normal ) use SI unit calculate creatinine clearance great equal 50 mL/min per Cockcroft Gault formula 14 . Adequate bone marrow function : Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) great equal 1500/mm3 ( great equal 1.5 X 103/ul ) Platelets great equal 100,000/mm3 ( great equal 100 X 109/L ) Hemoglobin great equal 9.0 g/dL 15 . Adequate liver function : Total bilirubin less equal 1.5 X ULN except unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia Gilbert 's syndrome Alkaline phosphatase , alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) , aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) less equal 3 X ULN ( less equal 5 X ULN participant liver metastasis ) . If alkaline phosphatase great 3 X ULN ( absence liver metastasis ) great 5 X ULN ( presence liver metastasis ) AND participant also know bone metastasis , liverspecific alkaline phosphatase must separate total use ass liver function instead total alkaline phosphatase 16 . Adequate blood coagulation function evidence International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) less equal 1.5 17 . Willing able comply aspect protocol 18 . Provide write informed consent prior studyspecific screening procedure 19 . Females must lactate pregnant screen baseline ( document negative betahuman chorionic gonadotropin [ BhCG ] test minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit BhCG ) . A separate baseline assessment require negative screening pregnancy test obtain 72 hour first dose study drug . All female consider childbearing potential unless postmenopausal ( least 12 month consecutive amenorrheic , appropriate age group , without know suspected cause ) sterilize surgically ( ie , bilateral tubal ligation , total hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy , surgery least 1 month dose ) . Females childbearing potential must unprotected sexual intercourse within 30 day prior study entry must agree use highly effective method contraception , last menstrual period prior initiation treatment , Treatment Cycles , 30 day final dose study treatment , male partner use condom . Highly effective contraception include : Double barrier method contraception condom plus diaphragm cervical/vault cap spermicide Placement intrauterine device Established hormonal contraceptive method : oral , injectable , implant . Females use hormonal contraceptive must stable dose hormonal contraceptive product least 4 week prior dose must continue use contraceptive study 30 day study drug discontinuation . Female participant exempt requirement participant practice total abstinence male partner vasectomize confirm azoospermia . If currently abstinent , participant must agree use double barrier method describe become sexually active Treatment Cycles , 30 day study drug discontinuation 20 . Male participant must successful vasectomy ( confirm azoospermia ) female partner must meet criterion ( ie , childbearing potential practicing highly effective contraception use condom throughout study period 90 day study drug discontinuation ) 1 . Other malignancy active within previous 2 year except basal squamous cell skin cancer , superficial bladder cancer carcinoma situ cervix breast complete curative therapy 2 . Participants active autoimmune disease ( Appendix 2 ) document history autoimmune disease , poorly control asthma history syndrome require systemic steroid immunosuppressive medication , except participant vitiligo resolve childhood asthma/atopy . Participants asthma require intermittent use bronchodilator ( albuterol ) exclude study . 3 . Participants inflammatory bowel disease 4 . Known human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection 5 . Active infection require therapy , include know positive test Hepatitis B surface antigen hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) RNA 6 . Major surgery within 4 week first dose study drug 7 . Concurrent medical condition require use immunosuppressive medication , immunosuppressive dos systemic absorbable topical corticosteroid except inhaled intranasal corticosteroid ( minimal systemic absorption ) 8 . Inability take oral medication , malabsorption syndrome uncontrolled gastrointestinal condition ( eg , nausea , diarrhea , vomit ) might impair bioavailability E7046 9 . Any major illness , investigator 's judgment , substantially increase risk associate participant 's participation study 10 . Use investigational drug within 28 day least 5 halflives ( whichever short ) study drug administration 11 . Prior exposure drug antagonists colony stimulate factor1 receptor ( CSF1R ) like limit emactuzumab ( RG7155 ) ( Roche ) , PLX3397 ( Plexicon ) , JNJ40346627 ( J &amp; J ) 12 . Use live vaccine ( eg , intranasal influenza , measles , mumps , rubella , oral polio , BCG , yellow fever , varicella , TY21a typhoid vaccine ) within 28 day 13 . Prolongation correct QT [ QTcF ( Fridericia 's correct QT interval ) ] interval great 480 msec electrolyte balance normal 14 . Significant cardiovascular impairment : history congestive heart failure great New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class II , uncontrolled arterial hypertension , unstable angina , myocardial infarction , stroke within 6 month first dose study drug ; cardiac arrhythmia require medical treatment ( include oral anticoagulation ) 15 . Females pregnant ( positive urine test ) breastfeed 16 . Any history medical condition concomitant medical condition , opinion investigator , would compromise subject 's ability safely complete study</criteria>
