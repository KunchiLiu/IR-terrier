	<brief_summary>Current recommendation diagnosis bacteremia base embodiment February-March blood culture separate minimum interval 30 minute . Each blood culture comprise seed pair aerobic anaerobic vial inoculate 5 10 ml blood . The sensitivity specificity technique depend essentially amount blood remove since direct relationship volume blood inoculate flask efficiency technique . A preliminary study conduct University Hospital Caen find 14-30 % patient depend service receive one blood culture . In addition , least four blood culture 24 hour take 10 20 % patient . The practice single blood culture reduce sensitivity analysis due insufficient total amount blood collect . The practice many blood culture increase risk false positive ( presence contaminate bacteria ) , generate extra work healthcare personnel ( laboratory ) represent significant cost unproven benefit . The investigator propose evaluate single blood culture sample technique seed 4 vial ( 2 aerobic anaerobic 2 ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Blood culture collect patient admit follow sign : fever ( ≥38.5°C ) , hypothermia ( ≤36°C ) , chill shock . For first blood culture , 40 mL blood obtain aseptically single phlebotomy equally distribute two BacT/Alert FA aerobic bottle two BacT/Alert FN anaerobic bottle ( bioMérieux , La-Balme-les-Grottes , France ) . The four bottle label one four follow order : aerobic-anaerobic-aerobic-anaerobic . Within next 24 h , one three 20-mL blood culture consist single pair aerobic anaerobic bottle perform , space minimum 30 minute . Bottles incubate 5 day positivity report BacT/Alert 3D instrument .</detailed_description>
