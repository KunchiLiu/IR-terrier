	<brief_summary>Animal source food ( ASF ) , meat egg , rich nutrient critical growth development . Yet , poor child develop country , ASF consumption limit cost , inadequate caregiver knowledge , lack local production physical availability . The impact HH- village-level livestock intervention household dietary diversity nutritional status resource-poor community well establish . The objective study test effectiveness local egg production intervention maternal child diet child nutrition status . This project take place Luangwa Valley , Zambia partnership local non-governmental organization , COMACO . Twenty community assign intervention , 20 matched community select control . In intervention community , egg production facility build , own , operate trained COMACO farmer . Simultaneously , nutrition-focused behavior change campaign disseminated community . Households ( HHs ) community sample twice annually 1 year pre-intervention ( baseline ) 2 year post-intervention assess dietary diversity nutritional status . Data analysis test change outcomes baseline intervention community compare match control community .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessing Effect Sustainable Small-scale Egg Production Maternal Child Nutrition Rural Zambia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective study test effectiveness intervention establish local egg production maternal child diet nutrition status . The investigator hypothesize intervention , combine appropriate agricultural extension nutrition education program , result : 1 ) increase total household , maternal , child consumption egg ; 2 ) improve maternal child dietary quality ; 3 ) improve infant/ young child nutritional status . The investigator test hypothesis Luangwa Valley , Zambia partnership local non-governmental organization , Community Markets Conservation ( COMACO ) . The forty study site locate four geographic cluster ( Chiefdoms ) Eastern Province Zambia . These Chiefdoms locate two district : Mambwe ( Mnkhanya , Jumbe , Nsefu Chiefdoms ) Lundazi ( Mwanya Chiefdom ) . Twenty community assign intervention ( egg production community nutrition education ) , 20 matched community select control ( nutrition education ) . In intervention community , egg production facility build , own operate trained COMACO farmer , mostly woman . Each group provide layer pullet point-of-lay layer mash . Facility owner make business decision , retain profit , responsible upkeep cost . Simultaneously , nutrition-focused behavior change campaign disseminate COMACO 's extension channel , reach intervention control community . In repeated cross-sectional study design , indicator food security , wealth , diet , nutritional status ( anthropometrics ) , health wellbeing assess egg-producing HHs women/child dyad ( child age 6-36 month ) reside area surround facility central control point . Data collect twice annually 1 year pre-intervention ( baseline ) 2 year post-intervention The exposure interest live egg-producing community . In primary analysis , investigator use hierarchical mixed effect model analyze effect program outcome interest ( see Outcome Measures section detail ) .</detailed_description>
