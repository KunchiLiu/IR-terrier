	<brief_summary>People live community follow stroke fall frequently . The ability take step response balance disturbance help prevent fall stroke survivor tend step paretic leg circumstance . This leave vulnerable fall towards paretic side . The purpose study train paretic limb step individual stand sideways treadmill respond sudden acceleration treadmill .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sideways Treadmill Training Improve Paretic Leg Stepping Persons Post-Stroke</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke survivor live community high risk fall . Falls consider one prevalent post-stroke complication . Fall history population associate develop activity limitation , decreased independence increase fear fall . The ability step response equilibrium disturbance consider critical prevent fall . Stroke survivor tend step paretic limb stand equilibrium perturbed . Training paretic limb step response perturbation limit success stroke survivor . In response sagittal plane perturbation training , stroke survivor continue tend step non-paretic leg even cue induced step paretic leg . This tendency decrease flexibility respond perturbation also make difficult train paretic limb . In contrast , coronal plane perturbation may useful way induce paretic limb step . Acceleration deceleration treadmill use train reactive step direction person Parkinson 's Disease . Coronal plane perturbation may elicit great response paretic limb never investigate stroke population . In study participant engage 6 training session 2-3 week . They stand sideways treadmill paretic leg towards front treadmill belt , suddenly accelerate 3 second predetermined velocity . Participants perform 80 trial session one follow four train condition . NON-ENCOURAGED TREADMILL ONLY : These trial define trial subject instructed respond necessary remain front half treadmill maintain balance without use external support , give specific instruction limb use initiate stepping treadmill begin move . NON-ENCOURAGED USE TREADMILL PLUS SECONDARY TASK : All procedure non-encouraged use treadmill trial use follow addition . Just subject attains equal weight bearing , subject engage cognitive task name many item category able . During time period , treadmill start randomly . ENCOURAGED USE TREADMILL ONLY TRIALS : These trial define trial subject instruct respond necessary remain front half treadmill maintain balance without use external support AND initiate stepping paretic leg treadmill begin move . ENCOURAGED USE TREADMILL PLUS SECONDARY TASK : All procedure encourage use treadmill trial use follow addition . Just subject attains equal weight bearing , subject engage cognitive task name many item category able . During time period , treadmill start randomly . In pilot testing , protocol tolerate community dwell stroke survivor encourage use trial feedback consistently elicit paretic leg reactive step .</detailed_description>
