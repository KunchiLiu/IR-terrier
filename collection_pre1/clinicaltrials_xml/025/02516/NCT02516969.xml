	<detailed_description>The primary objective study compare 1-year local control patient operable , recurrent previously-irradiated squamous cell head-and-neck cancer without adjuvant SBRT . The secondary objective study determine locoregional progression-free survival ( PFS ) distant PFS , overall PFS ( local + regional + distant ) , overall survival ( OS ) , evaluate acute late toxicity adjuvant SBRT re-irradiation set follow salvage surgery , determine prognostic factor may predict likelihood local failure , regional failure , OS cohort guide future management , compare impact adjuvant SBRT versus wait-and-see approach patient report quality life ( PR-QoL ) , compare surgical versus SBRT-induced immunological serum marker relation local control .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Pathologically proven recurrent secondprimary headandneck cancer receive prior radiotherapy without chemotherapy . Prior radiotherapy dose ≥50Gy No evidence distant metastasis Macroscopic complete salvage surgery curative intent ( surgery perform biopsy palliation ) . Final pathology image must indicate R0 R1 resection ( gross disease remain ) . Highrisk pathologic feature must present : compromised/positive surgical margin ( ≤ 2mm ) extranodal extension ( patient highrisk feature gross perinueral invasion , bone invasion , angiolyphatic invasion , constellation factor may eligible base casebycase basis discretion principal investigator ) . Karnofsky Performance Status ≥60 ( ECOG 02 ) Any number type prior chemotherapy allow ( patient may receive concurrent adjuvant systemic therapy cetuximab discretion treat oncologic team ) Evidence distant metastasis stag image modality Women breast feeding , positive pregnancy test ( reproductive age use effective birth control study randomize SBRT treatment arm ) Any patient gross residual disease follow salvage surgery Any comorbidity condition sufficient severity limit full compliance protocol per assessment principal investigator .</criteria>
