	<brief_summary>Because large proportion embryo 's quality dependent upon egg , investigation focus treatment oocyte vitro maturation ( IVM ) . In typical IVF cycle , egg recover mature ready fertilize . However , point oocyte 's quality set , alter . Therefore , impact oocyte quality use IVM critical . Development successful IVM protocol clinical use would provide option woman advance maternal age , would also reduce cost IVF due few exogenous gonadotropin use stimulation , significantly lessen risk ovarian hyper-stimulation . The objective research study evaluate newly develop oocyte maturation medium system human clinical use assist reproductive technology ( ART ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>In Vitro Maturation Human Eggs</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The novel device ( IVM medium system ) , design support nuclear maturation immature oocytes recover minimal ovarian stimulation LH/hCG administration , improve oocyte competence . This may result development great number embryos blastocyst stage . FSH administer starting cycle day 3 stimulate follicle growth . When lead follicle reach 12-14 mm , egg retrieval schedule . No hCG/LH trigger administer . Specially design maturation medium use collect culture immature egg recover follicle . Once eggs mature vitro , fertilization embryo culture , vitrification comprehensive chromosomal screening complete per standard operating procedure .</detailed_description>
