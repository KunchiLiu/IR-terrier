	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial Incentive-based Physical Activity Program Targeting Both Children Adults ( FIT-FAM )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There overwhelm evidence sustain physical activity reduces risk many common disease . Yet , data reveal low level physical activity among work age adult child Singapore . One strategy successfully employ influence behaviour parent use child intermediary . This strategy successful track record public health , child help parent quit smoke wear seatbelt . In study , investigator propose test whether child promote increased physical activity work parent time increase activity level . This proposal extension prior study investigator show modest financial incentive increase physical activity level among child . The investigator propose conduct follow-on trial reward tie child 's step , parent . Rewards base step activity measure state-of-the-art wireless step counter worn wrist hip . Just child motivate increase activity level effort achieve incentive , investigator hypothesize also effective advocate increase activity level parent . Specifically , investigator propose conduct 12 month two-arm randomize control trial ( RCT ) evaluate efficacy family base incentive scheme work parent ' physical activity measure via accelerometry . The investigator hypothesize parent family-based incentive arm ( FBI ) show great number daily step interim 6 month assessment final 12 month assessment point compare parent child base incentive ( CBI ) arm , measure accelerometry . Secondary aim test effect intervention parent 's child 's MVPA bout minute per week , MVPA minute , physical activity endpoint measure accelerometry , child 's step , parent 's child 's activity level throughout intervention period measure pedometer , health outcome health-related quality life parent follow-up .</detailed_description>
