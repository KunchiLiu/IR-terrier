	<brief_summary>Accurate optical diagnosis colorectal polyp could allow `` resect discard '' strategy surveillance interval determine base result optical biopsy . The investigator perform education characterize histology diminutive small colorectal polyp use narrow band imaging ( NBI ) . After education program , investigator prospectively evaluate real-time optical biopsy analysis polyp NBI 16 academic base gastroenterologist .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Real-time Diagnosis Colorectal Polyps Using Narrow-Band Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study extension quality assurance program Seoul National University Hospital Healthcare System Gangnam Center . This study compose four period . First , computer base education program accuracy predict polyp histology NBI ( NICE WASP classification ) perform 16 endoscopists ( expert non-experts NBI ) August 2015 . In second period September 2015 till October 2015 , 1st phase real- time optical diagnosis diminutive small colorectal polyp activate . All endoscopists feedback accuracy optical diagnosis polyp , discus NBI finding mismatch histologic diagnosis together per one month . Third , result 1st phase real-time optical diagnosis analyze November 2015 till December 2015 . In period , endoscopists low accuracy 1st phase real-time optical diagnosis re-educated use computer base training module . The last period January 2016 till August 2016 , 2nd phase real-time optical diagnosis polyp activate . Performance evaluate compare optically predict diagnosis actual histologic diagnosis . Cumulative sum analysis use determine learn curve endoscopist . Negative predictive value prediction nonneoplastic polyp concordance surveillance interval diminutive polyp diagnose optically high confidence also measure .</detailed_description>
