	<brief_title>Effects Gaseous Cryotherapy Knee ROM After TKA : A Feasibility Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : After total knee arthroplasty ( TKA ) , patient discharge hospital early two day surgery . However , patient often achieve functional knee flexion range motion ( ROM ) first postoperative day . Early application hyperbaric gaseous cryotherapy ( HGC ) operate knee within hour surgery next postoperative day might increase ROM reduce inflammation , edema pain . However , unclear whether early application HGC feasible . Moreover , data allow calculation sample size required conduct randomize control trial compare effect HGC conventional cryotherapy increase knee flexion first two day TKA . Objectives : To investigate feasibility apply HGC within hour TKA twice day next postoperative day . To collect data change knee flexion ROM first two postoperative day calculate sample size require large randomize controlled trial . To compare effect HGC conventional cryotherapy change knee flexion ROM first two postoperative day . Design : A prospective , single-blinded , randomize , control pilot trial . Setting : Orthopedic postoperative unit acute care hospital . Interventions : Patients randomly allocate either hyperbaric gaseous cryotherapy ( intervention group ) ice bag cryotherapy ( control group ) . In group , participant receive specific cryotherapy intervention operate knee within hour surgery ( day 0 ) twice next two postoperative day ( day 1 day 2 ) . Outcome measure : Feasibility measure include rate eligible patient willing participate , attrition , adherence intervention presence adverse effect . Active passive knee flexion range motion ( ROM ) knee pain intensity rest evaluate postoperative day 1 2 . Change active passive knee flexion ROM knee pain intensity rest postoperative day 1 day 2 assess . Length hospital stay collect .</detailed_description>
