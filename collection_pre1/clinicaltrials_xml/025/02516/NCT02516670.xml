	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well docetaxel work give without ascorbic acid treat patient prostate cancer spread place body . Drugs use chemotherapy , docetaxel , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Ascorbic acid ( vitamin C ) water-soluble vitamin may help inhibit growth cancer cell . It yet know whether docetaxel work well give without ascorbic acid treat prostate cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Docetaxel With Without Ascorbic Acid Treating Patients With Metastatic Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare proportion metastatic prostate cancer patient prostate specific antigen ( PSA ) decline &gt; = 50 % 8 cycle docetaxel ascorbic acid ( Arm A ) versus docetaxel placebo ( Arm B ) . II . To compare proportion adverse event ( fatigue , nausea , bone pain , anorexia ) experience metastatic prostate cancer patient receive either docetaxel ascorbic acid ( Arm A ) versus docetaxel placebo ( Arm B ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess radiographic progression free survival ( rPFS ) patient metastatic prostate cancer compare treatment arm . II . To assess proportion high grade serious adverse event ( fatigue , nausea , bone pain , anorexia ) patient metastatic prostate cancer compare treatment arm 8 cycle treatment . III . To assess proportion high grade serious adverse event ( type ) patient metastatic prostate cancer compare treatment arm 8 cycle treatment . IV . To assess change quality life measure assess Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Prostate ( FACT-P ) questionnaire . V. To assess proportion metastatic prostate cancer patient require docetaxel dose reduction compare treatment arm 8 cycle treatment . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether ascorbic acid alters docetaxel exposure compare treatment arm . II . To determine peak trough ascorbic acid level . III . As pharmacodynamic measure oxidant injury vivo , measure F2-isoprostanes . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 treatment arm . ARM A : Patients receive docetaxel intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day 1 ascorbic acid IV thrice weekly . Treatment repeat every 21 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients receive docetaxel IV 60 minute day 1 placebo IV 60 minute thrice weekly . Treatment repeat every 21 day 8 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day every 6 month .</detailed_description>
