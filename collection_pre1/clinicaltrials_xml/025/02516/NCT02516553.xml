A list contraception method meet criterion provide patient information . For woman chilbearing potential use contraceptive pill , additional barrier method necessary due potential CYP3A4 induce effect BI894999 . Male patient partner childbearing potential must use condoms ensure partner use highly effective method birth control describe , trial least three month end trial Any female experience menarche meet criterion `` woman childbearing potential '' describe . Women childbearing potential define : woman postmenopausal ( 12 month menses without alternative medical cause ) permanently sterilize ( e.g. , tubal occlusion , hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy bilateral salpingectomy ) . 4 . Written inform consent consistent ICHGCP local legislation For patient solid tumour 1 . Patients histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis advance unresectable and/or metastatic solid tumour , fail conventional treatment therapy proven efficacy exists , amenable standard therapy 2 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance score 0 1 time screen 3 . Recovery therapyrelated toxicity previous chemotherapy , tyrosine kinase inhibitor , hormone therapy , immunotherapy , antibody , vaccine therapy , radiotherapy CTCAE &lt; =grade 1 ( exception alopecia , peripheral sensory neuropathy grade 2 ) 4 . Written inform consent tumour biopsy escalation phase Ia 1. optional patient extension MTD cohort , 2. optional patient extension MTD cohort time point described expansion phase . For patient extension MTD cohort , inclusion criterion 8 hereafter applicable In addition , patient include expansion phase ( part Ib ) must : 5. diagnose one one four type tumours select end escalation part . 6. measurable disease ( radiated lesion qualify target lesion ) accord RECIST 1.1 7. progressive disease within last 6 month , accord RECIST 1.1 8. tumour lesion accessible biopsy ( pre steady state treatment Cycle 1 , ideally anatomic lesion ) 9. give write informed consent tumour biopsy , one screen one start treatment , Day 11 Day 14 Cycle 1 In patient NHL 1.Patients relapse refractory nonHodgkin 's lymphoma fail amenable standard therapy indication therapy per investigator 's judgement 2 . ECOG Performance Status 0 , 1 2 time screen 3 . Measurable disease ( radiated lesion qualify target lesion ) accord RECIST 1.1 4 . Recovery therapyrelated toxicity previous antilymphoma therapy CTCAE &lt; = grade 1 ( exception alopecia , peripheral sensory neuropathy grade 2 ) 5. write informed consent tumour biopsy ( optional ) Exclusion criterion : For patient : 1 . Inability swallow tablet 2 . Second malignancy currently require another anticancer therapy 3 . Serum creatinine great 1.5 mg/dL ( &gt; 132 µmol/L , SI unit equivalent ) 4 . Women pregnant , nursing , plan become pregnant trial 5 . Treatment investigational drug participation another clinical interventional trial within past four week within five time halflife previous investigational drug , whichever short , start therapy concomitant trial 6 . Patients unable comply protocol 7 . Patients actively abuse alcohol drug . Since alcohol drug testing require per protocol , investigator 's discretion determine abuse . For patient solid tumour : 1 . Additional serious illness , concomitant nononcological disease ( e.g . active infectious disease know chronic Hepatitis B/Hepatitis C infection HIV ) , ongoing toxicity prior therapy consider investigator potentially compromise patient 's safety trial 2 . History presence cardiovascular abnormality deem clinically relevant investigator uncontrolled hypertension , congestive heart failure NYHA classification 3 , unstable angina poorly control arrhythmia . Myocardial infarction within 6 month prior study entry 3 . Clinical evidence symptomatic progressive brain leptomeningeal disease last 28 day start treatment BI 894999 4 . Absolute neutrophil count less 1500/mm3 5 . Platelet count less 100 000/mm3 6 . Bilirubin great 1.5 mg/dL ( &gt; 26 µmol/L , SI unit equivalent ) ( except know Gilbert 's syndrome , accept 2 mg/dL 34.2 µmol/L case ) 7 . Aspartate amino transferase ( AST ) and/or alanine amino transferase ( ALT ) great 2.5 time upper limit normal ( related liver metastasis , great five time upper limit normal ) 8 . Systemic anticancer therapy within four week five time halflife drug , whichever shorter palliative radiotherapy within past four week start therapy concomitantly trial . This restriction apply Luteinizing hormone release hormone ( LHRH ) agonists , steroid ( give stable dose last four week ) use palliative intent , bisphosphonates denosumab For patient NHL : 1 . Patient eligible curative salvage high dose therapy follow stem cell transplant . 2 . Primary central nervous system ( CNS ) lymphoma know CNS involvement 3 . Prior allogeneic bone marrow stem cell transplant 4 . Highdose therapy stem cell support &lt; 3 month prior visit 1 5 . AST ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit normal ( CTCAE grade 2 high ) 6 . Total bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x upper limit normal ( CTCAE grade 2 high ) 7 . Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1.0 x 10^9/L ( without growth factor support ) 8 . Platelets &lt; 100 x 10^9/L ( without transfusion ) 9 . Significant concurrent medical disease condition accord investigator 's judgement would either compromise patient safety interfere evaluation safety test drug , e.g . symptomatic congestive heart failure , unstable angina pectoris , cardiac arrhythmia require therapy exception extra systole minor conduction abnormalities 10 . Chronic ongoing infection require treatment time enrolment within previous two week , e.g . active infectious disease know Hepatitis B/Hepatitis C infection , HIV 11 . Systemic antiNHL therapy within past two week five time halflife drug , whichever short ( palliative radiotherapy agent use palliative reason example steroid ( steroid must give stable dose last four week ) bisphosphonates , allow )</criteria>
