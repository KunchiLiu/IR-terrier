	<brief_title>Strength Training Elderlies Their Effects Muscle Fatigue Microcirculation - Randomized Clinical Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Purpose The primary research question : Do muscular strength training program improve functional capacity , muscle performance microcirculation elderly ? Hypothesis : Strength training program promote electromyographic change development peripheral muscle fatigue microcirculatory blood flow contribute functional autonomy . Secondary Research Questions 1 . Does strength train program elderly improve standard electromyographic fatigue ? Hypothesis : Elderly practitioner strength exercise program show increased neuromuscular efficiency electromyographic fatigue index . 2 . Do strength train program elderly improve peripheral microcirculation ? Hypothesis : A regular program strength exercise elderly increase blood flow peripheral microcirculation change process muscle fatigue . These biomechanical physiological change contribute increase functional autonomy reduce risk fall elderly .</detailed_description>
