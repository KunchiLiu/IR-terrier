	<brief_summary>Alongside well-known physiological deconditioning , decrease muscle mass bone demineralization , extend stay weightlessness also cause cognitive dysfunction . However , study subject space mission short long term could determine cognitive dysfunction result direct effect weightlessness stress-related effect . Analysis electro-encephalography ( EEG ) use standardize mapping method use study change operation cerebral cortex near infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) reflection change cerebral hemodynamics . Their combined use relatively simple economical method study brain change environment normal brain imaging technique use . The main objective experiment evaluate alteration brain cortical activity brain oxygenation level induce micro- hypergravity condition .</brief_summary>
