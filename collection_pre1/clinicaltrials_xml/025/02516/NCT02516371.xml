	<detailed_description>The host 's inflammatory response tumor microenvironment could effect cancer progression prognosis . As component systemic inflammatory response , lymphocytes , neutrophil , platelet recognise important role carcinogenesis tumor progression . To date , number peripheral blood-derived inflammation-based score neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio ( NLR ) , platelet- lymphocyte ratio ( PLR ) propose prognostic marker numerous type cancer . But , little known impact subpopulation lymphocytes . The investigator try evaluate activity lymphocytes peripheral blood find relationship among clinical prognosis .</detailed_description>
