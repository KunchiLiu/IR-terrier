	<brief_title>Transcranial Electrical Neuromodulation Suppressing Epileptiform Discharges</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>One third patient epilepsy continue seizure despite receive antiepileptic medication . The application low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rTMS ) show promise decrease frequency epileptic seizure drug refractory patient . The mechanism action appear induction long term depression ( LTD ) target cortex low frequency ( 0.5 Hz 1 every 2 sec ) pulse . Unfortunately , electrical stimulation induce available TMS coil limit superficial ( gyral ) region cortex , whereas epileptic focus may occur sulcus , deep well superficial cortex . The investigator develop ability target current specific region cortex align source sink electrodes flexible subset 256 channel geodesic electrode array . A first step accurate localization likely epileptic focus 256 channel EEG . Detailed computational model electrical property head tissue allow optimization study select best pattern source-sink electrode individual 's head tissue epileptic focus . The goal safety feasibility trial Phase I test whether one week ( 5 day ) GTEN treatment achieve similar depression target cortical region low frequency rTMS , decrease excitability measure suppression epileptic spike . This safety feasibility trial receive Investigational Device Exemption FDA treat 20 patient focal neocortical epilepsy . Both Pulsed ( emulate rTMS ) Sustained ( emulate tDCS ) current sequence evaluate . If either prove successful suppressing spike , second feasibility study Phase II examine whether GTEN treatment ( Pulsed Sustained , whichever prove good ) 2 week ( 5 day per week ) treatment successful primary endpoint temporary suppression seizure . The GTEN system implement number advanced technology provide improve targeting compare conventional rTMS tDCS , include electronics pulse sustained delivery current 256 electrode ; double fault safety circuit ; computational modeling electromagnetic property patient 's head tissue GTEN target medical grade software ; lidocaine electrolyte minimizes pain pulsed sustain current 200 ÂµA per electrode ( 2 mA total ) ; online safety monitoring adverse EEG change 256 dEEG array . Based FDA feedback date , success trial allow u progress pivotal clinical efficacy trial ( separate funding ) support de novo 510k approval GTEN treatment temporary suppression seizures patient drug-resistant epilepsy .</detailed_description>

Two partial seizure , without secondary generalization , last month , less 10 seizure per day . 5 . Antiseizure drug regimen remain unchanged month study entry , reasonable likelihood stability duration study , exception allow shortterm rescue medication , lorazepam . 6 . A history epilepsy least 2 year . 7 . Ability provide consent ( adult ) 1 . If childbearing potential , patient must agree use effective method birth control study cease participation pregnant . 2 . Pregnancy 3 . A history condition progressive brain disorder , serious systemic disease , symptomatic cerebrovascular disease , cardiac disease , alcohol/substance abuse.Special condition , example , nonmalignant brain tumor vascular malformation , consider entry casebycase basis . 4 . A history condition status epilepticus psychogenic seizure ( seizure confirm EEG ) . 5 . Presence cardiac pacemaker , vagus nerve stimulator , metal implant body ( teeth ) include neurostimulators , cochlear implant , implanted medication pump ( screen use LCNI Safety Screening Questionaire ) . 6 . Previous surgery involve open skull . 7 . Allergy condition contraindicate lidocaine . 8 . Unable express presence pain discomfort . 9 . Sensitivity silver Although selection patient accord 5th inclusion criterion minimize medication change , patient antiseizure medication change physician course study , exclude study . Rather , physician inform researcher medication change may may exclude data final analysis .</criteria>
