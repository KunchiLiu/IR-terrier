	<brief_summary>With increasingly age population incidence peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) rise . With approximately one quarter PAD patient ultimately progress Critical Limb Ischaemia ( CLI ) , increase demand place vascular image accurately assess stenotic lesion . Early infrainguinal lesion ( i.e . TASC A &amp; B ) treat angioplasty+/- stenting accurate assessment relies image gold standard angiography . Patients PAD often concomitant co morbidity diabetes chronic renal impairment place increase risk develop contrast induce nephropathy ( CIN ) expose iodinate contrast medium . High risk individual decrease eGFR &lt; 60ml/min risk 20-30 % develop CIN . They increase morbidity mortality risk great need dialysis prolong patient hospital stay . Ideally , investigator search way decrease incidence CIN . Animal study recently pilot human trial show subject remote vascular bed brief ischaemic stress , follow period reperfusion ; term remote ischemic preconditioning ( RIPC ) , may confer protective benefit development CIN . This study aim determine RIPC protect CIN patient undergo elective peripheral angiography infrainguinal disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Use Remote Ischaemic Preconditioning Prevention Contrast Induced Nephropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Peripheral arterial disease ( PAD ) affect 3-10 % population prevalence rate rise age 15-20 % patient 70 [ 1 ] . Worldwide incidence rate rise , trend likely persist rise obesity diabetes level . Increasing number affect patient require angiography either diagnostic therapeutic modality improve peripheral blood flow relieve symptom CLI . The use iodinate contrast medium either diagnostic therapeutic procedure lead contrast induce nephropathy ( CIN ) direct toxic effect renal tubular cell induction renal ischemia . Contrast induce nephropathy lead cause hospital acquire acute kidney injury ( AKI ) define acute deterioration renal function define relative increase serum creatinine level &gt; =25 % factor &gt; =0.5mg/dl baseline within 48 hour administration iv contrast absence cause renal dysfunction [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] . While incidence CIN general population 2 % , rise high risk patient high 20-30 % [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] . Important risk factor development CIN include pre-existing impaired renal function , diabetes mellitus , hypertension , increase age congestive cardiac failure [ 5 ] . Depending risks present varying percentage patient proceed require temporary permanent dialysis , inherently high morbidity mortality rate [ 5 ] , [ 6 ] , [ 7 ] . The identification appropriate management patient prevent CIN important decrease associate accompany morbidity mortality patient cohort . Remote ischaemic preconditioning ( RIPC ) show confer benefit animal study patient undergo coronary angiography . A large cohort study 5787 patient advance PAD find moderate severe renal insufficiency associate increase odds death . The 1 year mortality risk note high patient severe renal insufficiency ( GFR &lt; 30ml/min per 1.73m2 ) ( OR : 2.97 95 % CI : 2.39-3.69 ) also tend high risk present tissue damage ( ischemic ulceration gangrene ) compare individual normal renal function ( OR : 2.21 ; 95 % CI : 0.64-2.98 ) [ 8 ] . Zaraca et al . recent systematic review report incidence CIN 9.2 % patient undergoing vascular surgery [ 9 ] . Identifiable risk factor include age &gt; 70yrs , high contrast volume , pre exisiting renal disease use antihypertensive medication . Ischaemic precondition endogenous mammalian mechanism whereby brief period ischaemia reperfusion confers resistance subsequent prolonged ischaemic insult . First observe canine heart , subsequent investigator note brief ischaemia remote organ e.g . skeletal muscle induce protection key central organ e.g . heart . This remote ischaemic preconditioning ( RIPC ) require direct interference target organ ' blood supply . It induce use blood pressure cuff produce brief episode upper limb ischaemia reperfusion . It confer protection upon numerous organ simultaneously . RIPC reduce myocardial injury follow aortic aneurysm repair , cardiac surgery angioplasty . It also reduce adverse ischaemic event six month follow percutaneous coronary intervention , imply medium-term effect . To date ischaemic conditioning apply primarily heart however animal study show pre conditioning offer renal protection [ 11 ] , [ 12 ] . Although direct application renal ischaemia impractical , remote ischaemic conditioning apply prior angiography procedure may offer protection kidney CIN . Whittaker Przyklenk 2011 explore concept retrospectively use data patient undergone emergency angioplasty ST elevation myocardial infarction [ 13 ] . The original trial RCT examine protective effect postconditioning myocardial ischemia [ 14 ] . The author retrospectively examine study patient treat multiple coronary balloon inflation well renal function patient expose remote conditioning . They conclude patient condition group receive 25 % contrast volume control group show decline renal function demonstrate examination glomerular filtration rate day 3 post procedure comparison control group saw significant decline renal function . Fikret et al 2012 Renal Protection Trial demonstrate protective benefit RIPC development CIN high risk patient undergo elective coronary angiography [ 15 ] . The need contrast-based procedure rise , especially vascular surgery increase number patient undergo endovascular procedure , incidence post-contrast renal failure , report mortality 34 % [ 16 ] . The potential use RIPC therefore reduce risk kidney damage demand investigation patient advance peripheral arterial disease increase risk develop CIN .</detailed_description>
