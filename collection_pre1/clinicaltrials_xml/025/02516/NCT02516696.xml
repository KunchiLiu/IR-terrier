	<detailed_description>This research study men woman newly diagnose , previously untreated multiple myeloma . The purpose study observe well different combination study drug work therapy patient newly diagnose , transplant ineligible , previously untreated multiple myeloma . The study do two arm : BiRd Arm : - Clarithromycin 500mg PO twice daily day 1-28 28-day cycle - Lenalidomide 25mg PO daily day 1-21 28-day cycle - Dexamethasone 40mg PO give day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 28-day cycle Rd Arm : - Lenalidomide 25mg PO daily day 1-21 28-day cycle - Dexamethasone 40mg PO give day 1 , 8 , 15 , 22 28-day cycle Subjects treat 28-day cycle may continue treatment long respond therapy experience unacceptable side effect disease progression . There evaluation end cycle . Participants study disease progression unacceptable toxicity .</detailed_description>
