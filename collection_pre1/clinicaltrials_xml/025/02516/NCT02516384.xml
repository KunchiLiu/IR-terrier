	<brief_summary>Inflammatory bowel disease condition cause gastrointestinal immune system dysregulation affect genetic environmental factor . Differences intestinal bacteria exist IBD patient healthy control , role intestinal bacteria development treatment IBD remain largely unknown . Fecal microbiota transplantation ( FMT ) transfer gastrointestinal bacteria healthy donor patient alter microbial diversity intent restore normal bacterial balance . Most study focus use treat Clostridium difficile ( CDI ) , infection characterize dysbiosis . Given role dysbiosis IBD , investigator hypothesize FMT may beneficial IBD . The purpose study prospectively examine safety FMT management ulcerative colitis ( UC ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Ulcerative colitis ( UC ) chronic inflammatory bowel disease ( IBD ) significant morbidity mortality . Current therapy remain limited side effect loss response time , ongoing need new therapy . Fecal microbiota transplantation ( FMT ) , proven safe effective management Clostridium difficile infection ( CDI ) propose therapy UC . There study examine role FMT UC , show mixed result , examine underlying immunologic microbial change explain FMT work specific donor certain recipient . Furthermore , study examine long-term safety FMT patient UC . This proposal aim examine : ( ) short- long-term safety FMT patient UC , ( b ) efficacy FMT therapy mild-moderate UC , ( c ) microbial immunologic change occur FMT , help understand work group patient .</detailed_description>
