	<brief_summary>Mutations SLC34A2 gene , encode sodium phosphate co-transporter ( NaPi-IIb ) , cause defect cell-uptake phosphate , lead formation calcium-phosphate concretion lung see Pulmonary Alveolar Microlithiasis ( PAM ) . Extra pulmonary calcification , include heart valve calcification , previously report patient PAM . Calcific Aortic Valve Disease ( CAVD ) common disease elderly characterise thicken calcification aortic valve leaflet absence rheumatic heart disease . CAVD present 25 % patient old age 65 year associate increase risk cardiovascular event . Currently , effective therapy disease surgical aortic valve replacement . Both calcium phosphate major component calcific deposit PAM CAVD . Based preliminary finding , investigator hypothesize mutation sodium phosphate co-transporters may play role pulmonary extra pulmonary calcification . Two study perform : 1 . A retrospective cross-sectional study include patient age ≤ 65 year CAVD Denmark Örebro , carry . Genetic association analysis perform investigate incidence common variant five gene represent sodium phosphate co-transporters ( SLC34A1 , SLC34A2 , SLC34A3 , SLC20A1 , SLC20A2 ) compare healthy control . Associated gene subsequently sequence identify possible causal mutation . 2 . In prospective study , aortic valve tissue collect patient AS undergoing surgical valve replacement . Molecular characterisation transporter conduct determine level specific mRNA protein RT-PCR/qPCR , Western Blotting , respectively . The localisation visualisation investigate immunostaining confocal laser microscopy . Fibroblasts endothelial cell isolate grown culture subsequent functional study phosphate uptake .</brief_summary>
