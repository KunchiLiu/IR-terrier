	<detailed_description>Coronary heart disease ( CHD ) lead cause death United States ; 600,000 Americans suffer fatal cardiac event year . Traditional CHD risk factor high blood pressure , smoking , elevate cholesterol fully account time occurrence CHD event . The term `` cardiovascular vulnerable patient '' use describe patient susceptible acute coronary event base upon plaque , blood , myocardial characteristic . Psychosocial factor also show associate increased adverse health outcome increase cardiovascular vulnerability . For example , clinical depression elevate depressive symptom associate increased morbidity mortality , result , American Heart Association recommend clinician routinely assess depression CHD patient . Although much research clinical recommendation focus depression , significance anxiety largely ignore , despite fact anxiety disorder prevalent depression general population associate similar level disability . Despite prevalence prognostic significance anxiety CHD population , randomize clinical trial ( RCTs ) specifically target anxious CHD patient . Anxiolytic medication , include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRIs ) , show effective treating anxiety . SSRIs evaluate treatment clinical depression cardiac patient , equivocal result . Surprisingly , knowledge , RCTs examine efficacy medication treat anxiety CHD patient . Moreover , many cardiac patient reluctant take additional medication psychotropic medication may effective everyone may produce unwanted side effect , continue need identify alternative approach treat anxiety cardiac patient . The investigator believe exercise may one approach . The purpose study evaluate follow hypothesis population CHD patient elevate symptoms anxiety . The present study examine impact 3-month intervention either exercise , Lexapro , placebo anxiety symptom CHD biomarkers among individual cardiac disease elevate anxiety . The investigator hypothesize : ( 1 ) Both exercise training medication reduce anxiety symptom great extent placebo ; ( 2 ) Exercise training improve CHD biomarkers risk include autonomic regulation , vascular endothelial function , inflammation either medication placebo ; ( 3 ) Improvements CHD biomarkers mediate reduction symptom anxiety . The investigator also explore potential moderator treatment ( e.g. , anxiety diagnosis , CHD severity ) well longer-term benefit treatment document medical event health care cost follow-up period 4 year .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men woman document CHD ( i.e. , prior MI , coronary revascularization procedure , &gt; 70 % stenosis least one coronary artery ) Age &gt; 39 year Patients also anxiety symptom severity score least 8 Hospital Anxiety DepressionAnxiety scale ( HADSA ) ; subgroup patient also DSM5 diagnosis Anxiety Disorder . The study team plan actively recruit woman minority , least 50 % woman 25 % minority . An MI coronary revascularization procedure ( i.e. , CABG percutaneous coronary intervention ) within last 3 month Unstable angina Severe leave ventricular dysfunction ( ejection fraction &lt; 30 % ) decompensated heart failure Unrevascularized leave main coronary artery stenosis &gt; 50 % Complete Pacemaker dependence Resting BP &gt; 200/120 mm Hg Conditions would preclude randomization either drug ( e.g. , prolong QT interval , know allergy intolerance escitalopram ) exercise ( e.g. , musculoskeletal problem abnormal cardiac response exercise ) Patients primary psychiatric diagnosis Anxiety Disorder exclude , include patient MDD , PTSD , OCD , follow DSM5 diagnosis : 1 . Dementia , delirium ; 2 . Schizophrenia , Schizoaffective , psychotic disorder ; 3 . Psychotic feature include delusion hallucination ; 4 . Current alcohol substance abuse disorder . Similarly , patient pose acute suicide homicide risk , course study , would likely require treatment additional psychopharmacologic agent enrol . Patients also exclude take medication would preclude assignment either drug exercise condition ( e.g. , clonidine , dicumarol , anticonvulsant , MAO inhibitor ) take herbal supplement purport mood effect ( e.g. , St. John 's Wort , valerian , ginkgo ) . Patients already engage regular exercise ( least 30 minute &gt; 1x/week ) enrol . Finally , pregnant woman exclude participation .</criteria>
