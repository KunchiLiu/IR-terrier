	<detailed_description>Background Cystectomy pelvic lymph node dissection urinary diversion major abdominal surgery , associate high incidence postoperative complication . Gastrointestinal complication frequent perioperative technique aim early return bowel function pursued.The rationale patient population ( i.e . cystectomy patient ileal urinary derivation ) high risk postoperative complication ( around 50 % ) specially gastrointestinal ( 8-20 % ) . There need improvement postoperative set aim reduce complication cost . Optimal postoperative pain management one key factor lead enhanced recovery surgery . The perioperative use thoracic epidural analgesia ( TEA ) major abdominal surgery establish , excellent analgesic property , also TEA reduces postoperative stress response , accelerate return bowel function , lower postoperative morbidity mortality . However , TEA associate additional cost , need close monitoring nursing . Once successfully establish , TEA require constant attention skilled nurse anaesthetist often acute pain service achieve maintain optimal analgesia . Attention must also direct limit avoid side-effects hypotension motor block , reduce benefit technique prevent patient mobilize effectively operation.In addition supplemental day indwell TEA catheter increase risk infection , associate high morbidity . The mean length stay TEA catheter cystectomy patient investigator ' institution 6 day . If risk epidural infection low ( estimate 1:2000 Switzerland , risk increase longer epidural catheter leave place . It recommend re-assess risk/benefit ratio TEA 4 day , sooner . Therefore , important develop strategy reduce duration TEA without impair benefit . Enhanced recovery surgery protocol , establish colorectal surgery last 10 year , recommend remove TEA catheter morning postoperative day ( POD ) 2 , impair return gastrointestinal function . However , approach well establish colorectal surgery , less evidence small bowel surgery cystectomy urinary diversion . Systemic analgesic prolonged-release oral formulation like oral oxycodone ( Oxycontin® ) combine drug mixture ( oral oxycodone/naloxone ( Targin® ) ) could valuable alternative pain treatment second analgesic step , start POD 3 , epidural catheter could remove early without impair postoperative enhance recovery include return bowel function . Both oxycodone naloxone orally administer recognize accepted treatment option.The select dosage orally administer drug accordance literature follow recommendation manufacturer . In addition dosage reflect clinical practice investigator ' institution . These drug daily use clinical set pain service . The implementation placebo control group consider gold standard approach randomize controlled trial aim assess benefit drug specific indication . In addition , rescue pain medication implant protocol . Rescue medication breakthrough pain additional epidural bolus 5 ml , limit maximum one bolus per h. In case persistent pain , orally administer 5 mg oxycodone every 4-6 hour allow ward nurse . The investigator expect , administer oxycodone/naloxone early postoperative period reduce length TEA without impair return bowel function . This could reduce risk induce prolonged TEA ( i.e . local infection , malfunction ) cost ( pain service ) . This result implementation future new postoperative analgesia concept early postoperative administration oral pain killer , reduce length epidural analgesia without impair enhanced recovery . A total 90 patient ( 30 per group ) undergo cystectomy urinary diversion perioperative thoracic epidural analgesia study . Blinding : Batches blind organize Mundipharma Medical Company ( Basel , Switzerland ) provide Mundipharma Research GmbH &amp; Co. KG grant good manufacturing practice ( GMP ) . As Targin tablet oblong shape Oxycontin tablets round double dummy approach inevitable warrant fully blind . It able optically recognize type drug administer . The one contain placebo , second 20mg oxycodone ( Oxycontin® ) third mixture oxycodone ( 20mg ) naloxone ( 10mg ) ( Targin® ) . Drugs orally administer 12 hour interval . Study nurse Department Urology bring randomize blind drug intermediate care unit seal package , describe name include patient . This allow blinding patient , patient 's nurse IMC ward urologist , data assessor ( include pain service ) . Randomisation do computer generate list , block 10 patient ; allocation leave concealed opaque number envelope . Patients include strictly accord low number . Duration study : The annual case load cystectomy around 100 investigator ' institution per year . The investigator expect recruit participant within 24 month . To ensure study conduct anticipated timeframe , interim analysis recruitment schedule 1 year Swissmedic study approval . If recruitment remain expectation completion study timely manner jeopardize , would result abandon Oxycodone arm . Sequence study : Seven day ( inclusion day surgery , finish removal epidural catheter ) Time course study : Admission day : After inform patient consent , patient randomize . End surgery till POD 3 , morning : The study start cystectomy combine urinary diversion successfully perform combine anesthesia ( general plus TEA ) . After closure abdominal wall , continuous epidural analgesia maintain bupivacaine 1.25mg/ml use ambulatory infusion pump . The initial infusion rate 8 ml/h , additional bolus volume 4 ml ( lockout time : 1 h ) . The infusion rate adapt necessary base assessment make every 4 h maintain pain intensity low 3 rest low 5 mobilization numeric rating scale ( NRS ) , 0=no pain 10=worst pain imaginable . The maximum infusion rate 10 ml/h . This epidural treatment accordance investigator ' internal standard successfully implement last 15 year . Data pain intensity , amount epidural mixture use per 24 h use rescue analgesic record daily . In addition , episodes PONV , first flatus defecation body weight document . POD 3 around 08:00 a.m. : According randomization , patient receive blind batch 20mg oxycodone , 20mg oxycodone plus 10mg naloxone oral placebo every 12 h , start 10 mg bid respectively 10mg/5mg move 20 mg bid ( 20mg/10mg ) day . Epidural mixture infusion reduce step 2 ml accord NRS score maintain pain intensity low 3 rest low 5 mobilization 6 h. The epidural catheter remove 6 h rate 2 ml/h , patient NRS &lt; 3 &lt; 5 rest mobilisation , respectively . If epidural catheter remove subcutaneous administration low weight molecular heparin ( LWMH ) ( always around 20:00 ) , infusion stop ( 0 ml/h ) length stay epidural catheter register ( length stay epidural catheter= insertion catheter rate epidural mixture =0ml/h ) , catheter remove accord investigator ' internal guideline ( least 12 h subcutaneous administration LWMH ) . The time epidural infusion stop record removal epidural catheter . Objective The objective study evaluate implementation oral opioid without naloxone early postoperative period patient undergo cystectomy urinary diversion intraoperative early postoperative use TEA . The investigator expect unchanged early return bowel function equal analgesia reduce length stay epidural catheter ( primary endpoint ) , thus potentially reduce epidural catheter associate complication lower cost ( nurse pain service ) . Methods Trial design : Randomized , double blind , parallel group , single center , intervention placebo control study Setting : Single center : Department Urology , University Hospital Bern , Inselspital . Selection trial subject : A total 90 patient ( 30 per group ) undergo cystectomy urinary diversion perioperative thoracic epidural analgesia study . Phase 4 For clinical trial drug : Clinical study phase phase clinical development ( e.g . Phase 1 , 2 , 3 4 ; accord ICH E8 para 3.1.3 Human Pharmacology , Therapeutic Exploratory , Therapeutic Confirmatory Therapeutic Use ) ; case Medical Device study rename use e.g . `` Phase development '' .</detailed_description>
