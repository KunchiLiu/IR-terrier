	<brief_title>Cardiac Rehabilitation Chagas Heart Failure</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present study consist pre/post single-arm intervention study conduct Evandro Chagas National Institute Infectious Disease ( INI ) , locate Rio de Janeiro , Brazil . INI national reference center treatment research infectious diseases tropical medicine Brazil , follow large cohort patient Chagas disease , diagnose two simultaneously positive serological test ( enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay indirect immunofluorescence ) . Patients include study submit physical exercise intervention protocol perform three time per week , 60 minute per session , 8-month period . Nutritional pharmaceutical counseling also monthly provide follow-up consisted general guidance adequate eat habit patient heart failure , mainly sodium water intake , medication usage , particularly drug dosage compliance.Patients include study follow 8-month period evaluation functional capacity ( maximal progressive cardiopulmonary exercise test ) , muscle respiratory strength ( manovacuometry ) body composition ( anthropometry skinfolds ) perform baseline , four month end follow-up . Assessments cardiac function ( bidimensional echocardiography ) , biomarkers ( lipid profile , glucose glycated hemoglobin ) quality life ( Minnesota Living Heart Failure questionnaire ) take baseline eight month follow-up .</detailed_description>
