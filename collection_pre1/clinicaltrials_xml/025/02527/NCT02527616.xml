	<detailed_description>Coronary artery disease common type heart disease affect million people worldwide . It cause narrow block artery ( know stenosis ) due plaque , restrict blood flow reduces amount oxygen heart . Over past decade , fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) measurement increasingly use cardiac catheterization laboratory , provide straightforward readily available quantitative assessment functional severity coronary artery stenosis , ability cardiologist discriminate stenosis cause ischemia physiologically insignificant basis coronary angiography alone limited . Measuring FFR determines ratio maximum achievable blood flow diseased narrowed coronary artery maximum blood flow normal coronary artery . This ratio represent potential decrease coronary flow distal coronary stenosis . FFR easily measure routine coronary angiography use pressure wire calculate ratio coronary pressure distal stenosis diseased segment aortic pressure condition maximum myocardial hyperemia . An FFR 1.0 widely accept normal . An FFR low 0.80 generally consider associate coronary ischemia widely accept favour revascularization conservative management . The current standard method measure FFR insert pressure wire coronary artery hyperaemic agent , normally adenosine , deliver continuous intravenous infusion via central femoral vein , large ante-cubital peripheral cannula intra-coronary bolus injection . The investigational device clinical investigation FFR catheter develop Diasolve Limited ; UK base medical device development company . The FFR catheter combine pressure wire hyperaemic agent delivery catheter , allow simultaneous delivery pressure wire administration hyperaemic agent directly coronary ostium proximal section coronary artery , perform FFR measurement use currently available pressure wire system Pressure Wire Certus Prestige St Jude Medical .</detailed_description>
