Women predominantly affect . Long term prognosis FMS might severe physical psychological consequence . The etiology FMS remain unknown recent study suggest disorder central pain modulation , neurotransmitter , sympatho-adrenal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system peripheral muscle issue . Indeed , muscular abnormality decrease ATP micro vascularization report , induce muscle weakness local biochemical change participate pain hyper sensitivity . Treatment FMS symptomatic , often difficult , associate pharmacological non-pharmacological therapy . Massages largely use FMS include chronic pain management recommendation . Massages recognize haptic hand practitioner move skin patient ; haptic massage superficial pressure apply skin similar weight hand 's deep haptic massage pressure apply weight hand , allow reach deep muscle structure . Deep haptic massage largely use athlete improve muscle recovery treat tendinitis . All massage evaluate FMS superficial haptic massage ; recognize efficient pain , anxiety depression perform least 5 week effect transient et remain optimized . The efficacy deep haptic massage evaluate pathological condition . The investigator hypothesize , FMS patient , deep intramuscular maneuver may solicit sensitive receptor , stimulate large caliber fiber A lemniscal conveyed way bypass chronic pain information carry C fiber extra-lemniscal pathway : `` Gate Control '' theory inhibit pain information .</brief_summary>
