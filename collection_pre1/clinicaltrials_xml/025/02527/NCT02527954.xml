	<brief_title>Aneuploidies Embryos Spermatozoa From Patients With Y-chromosome Microdeletions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nowadays , Y-chromosome microdeletions one common cause male infertility . With frequency 8-20 % non-obstructive azoospermic men 3-14 % severe oligozoospermic men , usual chromosome anomaly associate failure sperm production , although frequency seem change due difference experimental design , ethnic difference , genetic background , even environmental influence . The absence gene locate certain region long arm human Y chromosome , know azoospermia factor region ( AZF ) , cause spermatogenic failure , spermatozoon find either ejaculate testicle patient . Detection deletion crucial medical treatment patient , since prognostic value predict potential success testicular sperm retrieval azoospermic patient certain microdeletions , allow avoid invasive technique oligozoospermic patient whose sperm production could result progressive worsening . The development assist reproduction technique , intracytoplasmatic sperm injection ( ICSI ) , together testicular epididymis sperm retrieval azoospermic men allow patient become father use gamete . Although effect Y-chromosome microdeletions ICSI outcome controversial , ability vertically transmit genetic defect , infertility , offspring accept . Until recently , clinical consequence infertility suppose ICSI-conceived son father deletion . However , different study last year , suggest potentially risk transmit offspring , development sexual dysfunction due sex chromosome abnormality ( Turner Klinefelter syndrome , etc . ) somatic disorder worse health implication cause chromosome aberration outside AZF region autosomes associate Y-chromosome microdeletions . No major clinical complication infertility describe offspring born father deletion date , important remember first generation baby , mainly obtain ICSI , reach maturity . Moreover , mention chromosome anomaly , could stop embryo development increase miscarriage rate . Few study focus incidence miscarriage couple microdeletions detect frequents men couple recurrent pregnancy loss . In order offer fully genetic counseling couple , study focus relationship Y-chromosome microdeletions chromosomal abnormality , also provide information consequence embryos , require . Thus , actual risk transmit different anomaly associate microdeletions embryos clarify , increase chance successful pregnancy live birth . In study , investigator assess , use Fluorescence situ Hybridization ( FISH ) Comparative Genomic Hybridization ( CGH ) array Preimplantation Genetic Screening ( PGS ) , incidence aneuploidy spermatozoa embryos infertile men without microdeletions undergo assist reproduction clinic .</detailed_description>
