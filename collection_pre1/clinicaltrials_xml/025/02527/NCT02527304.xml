	<brief_summary>This pilot clinical trial study adaptive stag stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) treat patient spinal metastasis remove surgery . SBRT specialized radiation therapy delivers single , high dose radiation directly tumor may kill tumor cell cause less damage normal tissue . Adaptive SBRT use information gather treatment inform , guide , alter future radiation treatment . Staged SBRT use multiple treatment separate 2-3 week . Giving adaptive stag SBRT may work well treat spinal metastasis remove surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To assess feasibility single-fraction radiotherapy provide short-interval treatment response patient metastatic epidural spinal cord compression ( MESCC ) , additional stereotactic radiotherapy full therapeutic dos deliver respect spinal cord constraint , base follow metric : short distance gross disease spinal cord treatment ; epidural tumor volume treatment ; extent epidural compression treatment . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate pain control use Numerical Rating Pain Scale ( NRPS ) treatment . II . To evaluate patient quality life use Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-General ( FACT-G ) treatment . III . To evaluate functional outcome use ambulation score standardize neurologic exams treatment . OUTLINE : Patients undergo adaptive stag SBRT . Within 14-21 day , patient may undergo second treatment adaptive stag SBRT discretion treat physician base clinical parameter , diagnostic interval imaging , achievement spinal cord dose constraint . After completion study treatment , patient follow periodically .</detailed_description>
