	<brief_title>The Effect Sodium Nitrite Renal Function Blood Pressure Hypertensive Versus Healthy Subjects</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Nitric oxide ( NO ) important vasodilating molecule complex biochemistry metabolism . NO classically synthesize L-arginin endothelial nitric oxide synthase ( eNOS ) locate endothelial cell lining . Several chronic cardiovascular disease hypertension , chronic kidney disease diabetes accompany endothelial dysfunction hence diminish synthesis NO . NO reactive molecule direct investigation function limit mainly investigated inhibition eNOS . Recent research show sodium nitrite readily convert NO enzyme vivo . The effect sodium nitrite renal variable , vasoactive hormone central blood pressure previously unexamined . It possible achieve serial estimation central aortic systolic pressure ( CASP ) wrist born device . Hypothesis : 1 . Sodium nitrite infusion increase urinary sodium excretion glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) 2 . Sodium nitrite infusion increase plasma level nitrite , nitrate , NO cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cGMP ) 3 . Sodium nitrite infusion lower peripheral central blood pressure 4 . Renal clearance nitrite constant dose dependent 5 . Sodium nitrite infusion affect vasoactive hormone 6 . The hemodynamic renal effect pronounce hypertensive compare healthy control . Purpose : The purpose study investigate effect sodium nitrite infusion 1 . Renal handle nitrite , nitrate , sodium water 2 . Plasma concentration vasoactive hormone 3 . Peripheral ( brachial ) blood pressure CASP Design : 15 hypertensive subject 15 healthy , age sex match control recruit . Each subject attend two examination day . Four day prior examination day subject give standardized diet low level nitrate nitrite . On even examination day subject take single dose lithium carbonate 300 mg order measure lithium clearance . On examination day subject receive two hour infusion either placebo ( isotonic sodium chloride ) sodium nitrite . During two examination day subject receive treatment random order . Perspectives : Increasing knowledge nitrite-NO system contribute change clinical practise diagnostics treatment cardiovascular disease .</detailed_description>
