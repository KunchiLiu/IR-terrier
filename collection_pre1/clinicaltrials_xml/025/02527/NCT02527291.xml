	<brief_summary>We hypothesize stress cardiac surgery cardiopulmonary bypass cause reactivation latent CMV infection reactivation might prevalent patient complicate post-operative course . The study aim : - To study whether cardiac surgery trigger latent CMV reactivation compare reactivation rate sub group patient complicate post-operative course non complicate post operative course . - To study relationship expression IL28 SNP rs12979860 risk CMV replication non immunocompromised patient undergoing cardiac surgery .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study population screen cardiothorathic surgery ward Soroka Medical Center . A member study research team approach individual subject potential candidate ( inclusion criterion fulfil exclusion criterion ) participation study . The study member explain purpose , procedure intent study potential participant . Interested patient ask provide write consent prior perform study procedure . Each patient associate one group , accord CMV test result , do enrollment . Study Group - Study group comprise seropositive CMV patient undergo cardiothorathic surgery complicate postoperative course . Control Group 1 - first control group comprise patient seropositive CMV undergo cardiothorathic surgery normal postoperative course . Control Group 2 - second control group include seronegative patient CMV undergo cardiothorathic surgery complicate uncomplicated post-operative course . Visit 1 - Screening enrollment : After patient provide write inform consent data collection do study member include : demographic , clinical medical information . In addition , vital sign take blood work : CMV Ab , CMV PCR , CBC , INR , Chemistry IL28 . Visit 2 - follow ( 7th post operative day ) : For patient uncomplicated post operative ( post op ) course follow cartiothorathic post op clinic one week discharge . In addition routine blood work medical follow , second blood test panel drown include second CMV PCR control group 1 . For patient complicate post-operative course prolong hospitalization follow do cardiothorathic ward include medical track blood test second CMV PCR study group . For control group 2 : medical follow routine blood work . Visit 3- follow 2 ( 14 th post operative day ) : This visit follow patient still hospitalize post operatively . We keep medical track draw last blood test 3rd CMV PCR study group . For control group 1 2 : medical follow routine blood work . Visit 4 - follow 3 ( 90 day post op ) : Data collection computerize medical record patient .</detailed_description>
