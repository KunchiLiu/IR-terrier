	<detailed_description>Spontaneous self-initiated action consequence , experience educational . Independent mobility believe essential perceptual-motor social skill development . Self-produced locomotion organizer psychological change child typical development , especially developmental change perception , social understanding , spatial cognitive , emotion . In addition , active manual exploration , child detect object individual 's information relate size , orientation , shape , substance perceptual movement capability interpersonal relationship . Children require exploratory behavior gather relevant information task . They learn relationship object-surface movement increase independent mobility manual exploration . There convince evidence use power mobility child disability positive impact overall development increase exploration . Studies focus reduce limitation area social , cognitive , perceptual , functional development induce lack independent mobility early age . Limited evidence also demonstrate early power mobility train positive impact family participation , include decrease parent ' level stress increase satisfaction child 's sleep pattern , ability move , ability interact socialize family . Pediatric rehabilitation , train assertive technology ( AT ) , seek provide child disability level mobility , exploration , socialization participation child typical development ( TD ) . Proponents power vehicle young child present strong reason introduce power mobility child time developmental pattern coincides closely possible would begin independent mobility child TD . Research suggest negative influence motor development self-care ability . In addition , child disability may motivate participate therapy may demonstrate increase head , trunk arm-hand control exploration surround environment . However , date , lack rigorous study limit evidence increase independent mobility early child development across three International Classification Functioning , Disability Health ( ICF ) level , still signify need consider early power mobility feasible intervention clinical setting young child yet achieve mean independent mobility unlikely achieve . There many basic barrier achieve high standard single AT combination AT currently provide level mobility exploration child , family therapist desire . Currently , critical barrier include power mobility EI program lack readily available power chair child young 2-3 year age , period mobility rapidly develop child typical development . Certain characteristic common commercial pediatric power wheelchair limit use home community space playgrounds . These limitation include price ( e.g. , typically &gt; $ 5000 ) , size weight ( e.g. , typically &gt; 150 lb ) , transportation requirement ( e.g. , van truck ) , maintenance aesthetic social acceptance . Experimental power mobility device ( PMD ) potential address limitation size , weight infant use . Unfortunately likely year commercial availability . Moreover , power wheelchair historically design address limit set goal related mobility minimal consideration socialization . Investigators believe need readily available mobility option immediate use young child family address limitation expand role PMD past simply mobility socialization . There four strength use ride-on toy car mobility . First , cost comparable less mobility device . Second , relatively lightweight , small easily transport contrast power chair . Third , child-friendly , colorful toy design acceptable adult child likely see simply toy . This may important aspect clinician want start early power mobility training family hesitant discus power chair option . Fourth , toy car simple electromagnetically device , modify quickly easily match child 's current and/or future ability goal . The use modify ride-on toy car may provide readily available , convenient fun way family , therapist early educator help young child improve mobility start within first year life . From initial pilot result , indicate early power mobility training use modify toy car might enhance cognition , language , mobility , socialization toddler mobility impairment . However , fine gross motor remain similar level 9-week intervention . These initial finding suggest number important point : 1 ) early power mobility training may increase exploratory behavior benefit independent mobility , cognitive social development ; 2 ) improvement child 's development caregiver 's involvement training may decrease family stress level increase family participation ; 3 ) simple early power mobility training may enough improve motor function . Better postural control couple reach grasp ability allow infant independently explore object new way sustain period mouth touch . The seat adjustment ( e.g. , seat belt er , hip strap ) ride-on toy car may provide sufficient postural stability child disability , however , impair reach grasp ability may decrease opportunity manual exploration hand . Most daily activity functional task may require two hand different action . The development increase functional independence require use hand cooperation . Gordon et al . ask caregiver identify goal intervention , measure progress use goal-attainment scale ( GAS ) . Nearly 85 % goal bimanual . Principles motor learning ( practice specificity ) suggest functional way balance cortical activity improve bi-manual control would practice bi-manual activity directly . Bi-manual training approach often use clinician treat upper extremity function . It appear well improve bi-manual coordination goal performance . Andersen et al . suggest bi-manual training may better child mild impairment , child without grasp ability one hand task grade hand use passive assist begin . Most importantly , bi-manual activity may motivate generally ecologically relevant may select maximize interest . Studies show intensive bi-manual training significantly improve quality quantity bi-manual hand use child hemispheric CP . It focus improve coordination upper extremity functional play activity , require active problem solve child discover bi-manual capability . Active discovery-learning problem solve principle learn within perception-action framework promote neural plasticity . Bi-manual training may allow direct practice functional meaningful goal , practice transfer unpracticed goal improve manual , exploratory learning . Theoretically , use power mobility combine increase manual exploration part comprehensive Early Intervention ( EI ) program within first three year life provide mobility also reduce secondary impairment child disability . Although increase interest , little empirical evidence effect even feasibility early power mobility train family participation overall development , particularly mobility socialization . Furthermore , date , evidence examine effect apply early PMD combine bi-manual training active discovery-learning upper extremity function young child disability . Our case report first study show positive effect use ride-on car mobility socialization child severe CP . The pilot result previous study also demonstrate positive impact implement early ride-on car training cognition , language , mobility toddler disability . It also help decrease caregiver 's stress level . However , motor function tend similar level 9-week intervention . In addition , little known learn curve use PMD improve development , e.g. , point time ( maximal ) effect reach . Up , study focus end result increase amount independent mobility daily life . It still unknown whether optimal ( maximal ) effect reach factor might influence learn curve well retention treatment effect long term . To improve overall development , investigator hypothesize combine modify ride-on toy car bi-manual training ( ROCBT ) may benefit toddler 's development cognition , socialization motor , especially manual exploration . Furthermore , combine training may improve toddler 's goal performance , enhance family 's perception child 's capability increase function participation level . In study , investigator modify ride-on toy car child disability use clinical setting part 18-week power mobility training program . In addition , investigator combine ride-on toy use bi-manual training compare result regular therapy . Investigators focus four research question . Specifically , investigator : 1 ) use modify toy car combine bi-manual training effective power mobility training program improve exploratory behavior overall development ; 2 ) select set dependent measure quantify whether child increase exploratory behavior ; 3 ) determine factor influence family 's perception environment , child ; 4 ) conduct hospital-based , power mobility train program result high level fun child compliance family therapist . If result generally positive show significant difference among ROCBT , early power mobility train regular therapy , provide u alternative way either improve overall development merely independent mobility socialization . Subsequently , future randomize control trial study could quantify effectiveness feasibility different treatment intensity various pediatric population . The specific aim study : 1 ) examine feasibility combine modify ROCBT mobility , socialization motor function toddler disability ; 2 ) quantify whether toddler disability able manual exploration social interaction ROCBT observation wrist-worn accelerator ; 3 ) determine critical factor use modify ride-on toy car family perception participation . Through comparison among ROCBT , early power mobility train regular therapy group , investigator hypothesize ROCBT group improvement mobility , socialization motor function early power mobility train control group . Children ROCBT group physical activity manual exploration social interaction , comparison early power mobility group , due combine bi-manual training . In addition , investigator hypothesize ROCBT elicit different family perception child 's capability , comparison early power mobility train regular therapy . Study Design : A pretest-post-test control group design apply . Three group involve project : hospital-based , modify ride-on car combine bi-manual training program ( ROCBT ) , early power mobility train program regular therapy program . The participant randomly assign one three group use well-sealed , opaque envelope recruit study . Once participant recruit study , research team modify toy car base participant 's capability pre-intervention phase ( first two three week intervention start ) , e.g. , seat steer wheel modification . The study duration participant 18 week , include 9-week intervention 9-week follow-up . Participants study 75 toddler age 12 month 36 month motor delay ( sd &gt; 1.5 ) .
