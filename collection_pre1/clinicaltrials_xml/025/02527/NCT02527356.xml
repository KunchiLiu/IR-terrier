	<detailed_description>Spontaneous self-initiated action consequence , experience educational . Children require exploratory behavior understand world establish knowledge advance cognition social interaction . Around end first year , typical infant increase exploration display number advance interaction object caregiver . Activities object become intentional infant engage object choose take lead initiating object exchange show offering object adult . Showing offer object adult may enable infant extend period social interaction , thereby provide opportunity infant learn language rule social interaction turn-taking . During time infant display advance interaction object adult , loco motor skill change dramatically . Independent mobility believe essential perceptual-motor social skill development . Self-produced locomotion organizer psychological change child 's typical development , especially developmental change perception , social understanding , spatial cognitive , emotion . Crawling walk infant spend enormous time energy interact space object around . When infant gain ability move around environment independently , milestone identify one transforms social world offer interaction include wide variety object people well opportunity consolidate attachment social referencing skill . Infants ' child 's exploratory experience , social behavior loco motor status functionally relate . There convince evidence use power mobility child disability positive impact overall development increase exploration . Studies focus reduce limitation area social , cognitive , perceptual , functional development induce lack independent mobility early age . Limited evidence also demonstrate early power mobility train positive impact family participation , include decrease parent ' level stress increase satisfaction child 's sleep pattern , ability move , ability interact socialize family . Pediatric rehabilitation , train assistive technology ( AT ) , seek provide child disability level mobility , exploration , socialization participation child typical development ( TD ) . There many basic barrier achieve high standard single AT combination AT currently provide level mobility exploration child , family therapist desire . Currently , critical barrier include power mobility EI program lack readily available power chair child young 2-3 year age , period mobility rapidly develop child TD . Certain characteristic common commercial pediatric power wheelchair limit use home community space playgrounds . These limitation include price , size weight , transportation requirement , maintenance , aesthetic social acceptance . Experimental power mobility device ( PMD ) potential address limitation size , weight infant use . Unfortunately likely year commercial availability . Moreover , power wheelchair historically design address limit set goal related mobility minimal consideration socialization . Although increase interest , little empirical evidence effect even feasibility early power mobility train overall development family participation , particularly socialization . Investigator believe need readily available mobility option immediate use young child family address limitation expand role PMD past simply mobility socialization . There four strength use ride-on toy car mobility . First , cost comparable less mobility device . Second , relatively lightweight , small easily transport contrast power chair . Third , child-friendly , colorful toy design acceptable adult child likely see simply toy . This may important aspect clinician want start early power mobility training family hesitant discus power chair option . Fourth , toy car simple electromagnetically device , modify quickly easily match child 's current and/or future ability goal . The use modify ride-on toy car may provide readily available , convenient fun way family , therapist early educator help young child improve mobility start within first year life . The preliminary study suggest number important finding : 1 ) early power mobility training increase exploratory behavior benefit independent mobility ; 2 ) current early power mobility training program improve socialization conventional therapy may similar effect ; 3 ) improvement child 's developmental level caregiver 's involvement training may decrease family stress level increase family participation . The integration object interaction , sit independent locomotion present ground view cognition , also affect language social development . In investigator preliminary group study , early power mobility train conventional therapy provide opportunity sit loco mote interact various object . The use ROC expand exploratory opportunity various environment toddler 's control . The coordination vision posture become finely tune coupled experience self-produced movement permit functional mapping perception action . Anderson et al . construct PMD pilot test extensively two year 7.5-month-old infant TD . They notice infant able control forward motion PMD development postural compensation peripheral flow facilitate experience . The visual-postural coupling highly link locomotor experience connect psychological change . However , coordination vision action find one posture unlikely generalize posture . In study , investigator modify two type ROCs toddler disability use clinical setting part 24-week power mobility training program . In addition , investigator compare effect apply early power mobility training regular therapy development . Investigator focus four research question . Specifically , investigator : 1 ) use modify toy car two different posture effective power mobility training program improve independent mobility socialization ; 2 ) select set dependent measure quantify whether child increase exploratory social behavior ; 3 ) conduct hospital-based , power mobility train program result high level fun child compliance family therapist . In addition , investigator examine whether effect increase independent mobility socialization affect toddler 's function 3 International Classification Function ( ICF ) domains . If investigator result generally positive show significant difference independent mobility socialization among early power mobility training program two different posture regular therapy , provide u alternative way advance independent mobility socialization . Subsequently , randomize control trial study quantify effectiveness feasibility different treatment intensity various pediatric population . The specific aim study : 1 ) examine feasibility effect ROC train two different posture mobility socialization toddler disability ; 2 ) quantify whether toddler disability able exploratory behavior social interaction ROC train observation wrist-worn accelerometer ; 3 ) determine critical factor use different mode modify ROC family perception participation . Through comparison among two ROC train group ( i.e. , treatment group ) regular therapy group ( i.e. , control group ) , investigator hypothesize group ROC training improvement functional mobility , socialization parent stress control group . Specifically , treatment group ROC training stand posture increase social function sit posture ROC training control group . In addition , toddler treatment group physical activity exploration , comparison control group . Investigator also hypothesize ROC train different posture elicit different family perception child 's capability , i.e. , caregiver , comparison regular therapy . Study Design : A multiple group pretest-posttest control group design apply . Three group involve project : ride-on car sit posture ( ROC-Sit ) , ride-on car standing posture ( ROC-Stand ) regular therapy . The participant randomly assign one three group use well-sealed , opaque envelope recruit study . Once participant recruit study , research team modify toy car base participant 's group capabilities pre-intervention phase ( first two three week intervention start ) , e.g. , seat steer wheel modification . All modification disassemble adjust base participant 's progress intervention . The study duration participant 24-week , include 12-week intervention 12-week follow-up . Participants study 60 infant preschool child age 12 month 36 month motor delay ( sd &gt; 1.5 ) . The age group infants/preschool child select base previous study early power mobility training infant preschool child . Power mobility training typically offer child two six year age , three year average age young child recommend powered chair . However , study show early power mobility training feasible 7-month-old infant 18-month-old child mobility disability . Recruitment : The child recruit self-referrals , health care practitioner , hospital Taipei Taoyuan , Taiwan child motor delay ( &gt; 1.5 sd ) receive outpatient rehabilitation . The research team initially post flyer describe study clinical setting contact therapist clinical setting introduce goal , criterion general procedure study . Parents/guardians obtain information study flyer therapist . Parents/guardians , interested whose child meet criterion diagnosis , age , capability determine doctor therapist , give contact information investigator . After receive contact information , research team contact parents/guardian and/or therapist schedule date test research team hospital . When research team contact parent , study explain parent receive letter detail procedure give opportunity ask question . Parents/guardians sign inform consent form time first visit . Procedure : Before pre-intervention assessment , research team modify car 's seat acceleration hand switch-driven , allow car derivable participant meet inclusion criterion . Each participant ROC training group either customized , sitting-style toy car standing-style toy car , depend assign group . In addition original design sitting-style toy car investigator previous study , investigator add seat height , extra seat belt pipe frame ensure participant 's safety whole device 's stability stand mode locomotion . The adaptation assemble PVC pipe adjust easily train session . After modification , receive pre-intervention assessment , include behavioral videotaping developmental assessment . The developmental assessment occur first last week 12-week intervention , end 12-week follow-up phase . A therapist involve intervention blind study purpose complete developmental test . The drive socialization behavior videotape research team 1 hour/per session , 1 session/per week , intervention phase hospital . In addition , participant wear two accelerometer wrist monitor physical activity 1 hour videotape session . All videotape cod two independent coder , undergraduate student . Prior make rating , coder instruct cod procedure PI , he/she inform group assignment purpose study . Intervention The research team ask caregiver identify goal ( intervention ) , measure progress use goal-attainment scaling ( GAS ) intervention three group . All three group continue regular therapy intervention phase . Ride-On Cars Sitting Posture ( ROC-Sit ) The research team ask caregiver identify goal , measure progress use goal-attainment scaling ( GAS ) . The regular therapy group continue regular therapy , include physical , occupational speech therapy . In addition , receive training program hospital 2 hours/per session , 2 sessions/per week total 12-week intervention . The general propose training improve developmental scale , mobility , socialization upper limb use functional task . The participant also experience two 30-minute car driving session whole 2-hour training . The difference regular therapy group two ROC group experience car driving control therapist , i.e . passive locomotion . Investigator discuss clinical therapist provide train program hospital 2 hours/per session , 2 sessions/per week total 12-week intervention . Each week research team videotape child 's natural play drive performance first hour training session intervention phase . The 2-hour training session compose two 30-minute drive session two 25-minute natural play session , 10-minute break . Every week 's treatment program preplanned adjusted therapist caregiver discussion clinical observation participant 's performance previous session . Training concentrate building concept casual-effect switch car motion , goal-oriented driving hospital , upper limb use functional task drive hand use functional task exploration natural play session , discuss family , treat therapist research team . The car drive training include 2 phase : I-car exploration II-prompted driving . Participants learn move stop car car exploration phase . Through prompted driving phase II , use car mean explore environment ( e.g. , elevator , different store ) contact people ( e.g. , drive caregiver get toy ) . Ride-On Cars Standing Postures ( ROC-Stand ) Most guideline similar ROC-Sit , except posture driving . The training time period ROC-Sit . The two 30-minute driving session also divide 4 time 15-minute session , depend child 's standing ability support condition . Regular Therapy Program The research team ask caregiver identify goal ( intervention ) , measure progress use goal-attainment scaling ( GAS ) . The regular therapy group continue regular therapy , include physical , occupational speech therapy . The general propose training improve developmental scale , mobility , socialization upper limb use functional task . The research team videotape child 's natural play drive performance hospital 1 hour/per session , 1 session/per week 12-week intervention phase . Follow-up This period focus 12-week follow-up receiving treatment program . No treatment program deliver participant . The research team still videotape child 's natural play drive performance hospital 1 hour /per session , 1 session/per week 12-week follow-up phase . Data Reduction Analysis All videotape cod two independent coder , undergraduate student . Prior make rating , coder instruct coding procedure , he/she inform group assignment purpose study . From 1 hour film session intervention , participant 's 20 'most active ' minute 2 training ( i.e. , 10 minute drive 10 minute natural play ) select cod accord follow priority : first , minute participant move space driving , physically verbally interact caregiver , therapist peer ; second , remain minute participant move space without interaction ; third , minute interact stationary body movement ; fourth , minute interact stationary body movement ; fifth , minute body movement stationary interacting ; last , minute stationary body movement interaction . Thus , 20-minute 'most-active ' minute categorize 10-minute 'Car Play ' ( drive training ) 10-minute 'Natural Play ' . Mobility Measures The following measure obtain via video cod 10-minute Car Play pre-intervention , intervention post-intervention phase determine feasibility learn drive car : 1 . Driving Categories ( time second ) 1 . Independent Mobility : When child independently drive car precede independent switch contact without adult 's assistance . 2 . Assisted Mobility : When adult put child 's hand switch independently push switch begin drive . 3 . Caregiver Mobility : When child drive adult 's hand directly top hand . 2 . Visual Attention Switch : The frequency ( number time ) child look switch 10-minute driving . 3 . Stopping Categories ( number time divide total time goal present ) 1 . Independent Stop : When child independently move hand switch make car stop within one car length goal location . 2 . Stops Verbal Cues : When child move hand switch car arrive goal verbal cue give adult 3 . Stops Tactile Contacts : When child move hand switch car arrive goal tactile cue ( e.g. , touch hand move hand switch ) give adult Socialization Measures To examine impact independent mobility socialization 10-minute Natural Play 10-minute Car Play , follow measure obtain via cod video footage pre-intervention , intervention post-intervention : 1 . Reaching toy/person : The frequency ( number time ) child initially extend arm play toy/interacting person . 2 . Initiation contact others : peer-directed adult-directed : Target child-initiated contact others count whenever two condition meet : ( 1 ) target child initiate contact another individual without observable prompt initiate behavior part another person ( 2 ) target child independently vocalize ( either comprehensible word vocalization , include shouting , laugh , grunt , etc . ) physically point , touch , indicate want something another individual . Target child-initiated contact vocalization divide two category : ( ) peer-directed ( b ) adult-directed . 3 . Other initiated contact : contact peer adult : Peer-initiated contact define child initiate type contact target child ( e.g. , talk child , touch child mobility device child use , give toy item child , take toy item away child ) . Adult-initiated contact target child : ( ) carrying , move , otherwise touch child device child seat ( e.g. , swing , wheelchair , toy car ) ; ( b ) take toy item away child 4 . Facial Expression : The frequency ( number time ) positive negative facial expression appear interaction . Positive determined include smile laugh . Negative determined include discomfort , cry unhappy facial expression . 5 . Vocalization/Gesture : The frequency ( number time ) child vocalizes/gestures play toy person , include grunting , shout , vowel-type sound ( e.g. , ee , , ah , oo u ) . Repeated measure one way ANOVA use compare mean difference use different toy car mobility , socialization exploratory behavior intervention , 12-week follow-up , i.e. , within group comparison . One way ANOVA use compare mean difference developmental test , participation physical activity exploration among three group intervention end follow-up phase .</detailed_description>
