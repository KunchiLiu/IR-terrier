	<detailed_description>The objective surgical coronary revascularization restore blood flow supply myocardial territory ischemic risk infarction , interpose low-resistance conduit parallel major diseased coronary artery segment . The conductance additional conduit must sufficient accommodate high flow demand minimal pressure drop site distal implantation . Such conduit may use either single independent graft , assemble variety sequential configuration , accord prefer technique base underlying coronary artery disease ( CAD ) . Saphenous vein graft ( SVGs ) , commonly use single free graft reimplanted aorta , large conduit limit vasomotion . Their resistance blood flow negligible due large diameter , absence muscular layer usually short length , long-term patency hinder development premature atherosclerosis . In contrast , arterial graft usually small diameter resistive due histological feature . These arterial conduit usually use situ , second third order branch aorta , therefore , high pressure drop compare graft implant directly onto aorta . Alternatively , creation composite T graft free right internal thoracic artery ( RITA ) connect situ leave internal thoracic artery ( LITA ) allow revascularization myocardium risk . However , consequence combination flow supply entirely dependent flow capacity proximal LITA , resistance along graft may become concern , particularly distal anastomosis configuration ( due cumulative length distal graft taper ) . Competitive flow typically occur resistance graft closely match native coronary artery target . In situation , native coronary artery bypass graft contribute distal perfusion , provide resistance blood flow . Schematically , resistance arrange parallel input pressure coronary ostium ostium graft , output pressure anastomotic target site . The pressure two end circuit identical minor phasic variation proximal pressure due delay progression systolic pressure wave coronary ostium distal ostium graft . According Ohm 's law , blood flow directly proportional pressure gradient inversely proportional resistance . Consequently , relative contribution graft native circulation distal perfusion inversely proportional resistance : resistance graft exceed native vessel ( instance , situation non-severely obstructive CAD ) , distal territory predominantly perfuse native coronary artery ; resistance native vessel remain high , flow graft predominant ; conduit oppose near-identical resistance flow , contribution distal blood flow equivalent . Many report consistently suggest competitive flow arterial bypass graft negatively affect patency : graft failure observe native coronary stenosis less severe . Further , misunderstand competitive flow also impair multiple arterial grafting adoption rate , remain quite low worldwide despite proven superior outcome , due large part incomplete understanding effect flow competition surgeon . Current method evaluate coronary stenosis : visual inspection , quantitative computerize angiography ( QCA ) fractional flow reserve ( FFR ) . Several study compare three method , demonstrate visual assessment QCA limit value accurately predict significance intermediate narrowing , therefore , predict competition phenomenon . In contrast , FFR measure consequence stenosis term reduction blood flow capacity . FFR reliably identify stenosis associate inducible ischemia 93 % accuracy , rate high test . Despite advantage , FFR widely apply especially coronary surgery whereas interventional cardiology , use near systematically . What investigator propose collaborative study complete paradigm shift coronary surgery carry - total arterial grafting support true physiologic basis , correlate proof outcome . Currently , indication surgical coronary revascularization still largely rely visual estimation stenosis . Unfortunately , estimation true coronary lesion severity visual estimation especially poor moderate lesion , i.e . 50 70 % stenosis . An FFR cutoff value 0.8 obtain 35 % moderate lesion . When use saphenous vein , impact competition flow graft patency minimal situation artery conduit prefer , impact functionality graft significantly . Therefore , investigator propose prospective FFR evaluation surgical patient 3-vessel CAD , whose disease severity estimate visual inspection diagnostic angiogram . As new , innovative , potentially practice-changing approach , FFR perform value record ; however , patient , interventional cardiologist , surgeon blind result . All patient undergo coronary surgery complete arterial revascularization , per standard practice 2 co-PIs ( Dr Glineur - primarily composite ; Dr. Ruel - primarily situ ) . Six month surgery , control angiography perform evaluate functionality graft . The result functional assessment correlate preoperative FFR value , order find cutoff arterial graft functional , also analyze subgroup define accord configuration ( i.e . situ composite ) .</detailed_description>
