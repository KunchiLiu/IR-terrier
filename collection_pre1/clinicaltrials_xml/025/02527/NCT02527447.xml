	<brief_summary>Background : -Acute myeloid leukemia ( AML ) cancer white blood cell . It fatal . Standard treatment involve intensive chemotherapy . Not treatment work . AML respond treatment ( refractory ) return treatment ( relapse ) high-risk even treatment . Success therapy normally determine 28 56 day . This study see blood test day 4 therapy help identify early respond . Objectives : -To see blood test day 4 therapy help identify respond treatment AML . Eligibility : -People age 18-70 refractory relapse AML least one previous therapy . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood test . - Participants : - Several blood test . - Bone marrow exam : needle inserted hip take cell bone marrow . - Echocardiogram : small probe hold chest take picture heart . - ECG : soft electrode stuck skin . A machine record heart signal . - CT scan : lie machine take picture body . - Standard chemotherapy . - Possible transfusion blood product red blood cell platelet . - Participants expect stay study typically 2 3 month . This include inpatient treatment . Inpatient stay normally 1 2 month .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Effective treatment patient relapse refractory acute myeloid leukemia ( RR-AML ) remain significant unmet need . Current response criterion originally propose 1956 provide sensitive assessment AML disease burden , evidence disconnect apparent success current induction therapy achieve complete remission patient stark reality median overall survival time less two year . While sensitive minimal/measurable residual disease assay assess AML disease burden develop , role test treatment algorithm patient RR-AML yet define . We propose evaluate high sensitivity assay could function early predictor salvage therapy failure . This protocol design feasibility study evaluate use high sensitivity peripheral blood-based molecular assay day 4 induction salvage chemotherapy predict failure ultimately achieve CR CRi patient RR-AML . Eligible patient receive salvage induction therapy use FDA approve antineoplastic agent give either alone combination define National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) Clinical Practice Guidelines Oncology AML . Additional secondary objective include investigate relationship kinetics gene expression change response chemotherapy , determine proportion patient result day 4 peripheral blood gene expression test available day 8 therapy , determine proportion patient result pre-treatment molecular genetic test available day 8 therapy , assess patient disease specific factor associated failure achieve CR , determine feasibility measure AML residual disease burden use alternative technology alternative tissue source , determine proportion patient receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant completion therapy , determine incidence infectious complication use modern prophylactic antimicrobial agent compare historical comparison determine feasibility recruit patient RR-AML NIH Clinical Center .</detailed_description>
