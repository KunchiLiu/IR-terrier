	<detailed_description>BACKGROUND There several American study cost antifungal represent hospital bill , Brazil type study ( WINGARD 2007 ; GREENE 2007 ) . The American study extrapolate Brazil cost drug different well hospital charge . Furthermore , Brazil spend public medicine , govern Unified Health System ( SUS ) different employ complementary health service ( private health service ) . For reason , knowledge percentage represent antifungal hospital bill order define actual cost-effectiveness different formulation amphotericin B , consider length hospital adverse event mortality need . OBJECTIVES : Determine direct indirect hospital cost different formulation amphotericin B ( deoxycholate , lipid complex liposomal ) different public private hospital city Curitiba , Paraná , Brazil . Specifics 1 . Measuring total cost hospitalization antifungal treatment . 2 . Measure direct spending formulation amphotericin B 3 . Measuring indirect cost related nephrotoxicity different formulation amphotericin B 4 . Assemble model cost-effectiveness different formulation amphotericin B METHODS This retrospective , observational , cohort study economic . Database admissions patient used antifungal private hospital specific private health system ( 5 hospital ) databases two large public hospital Curitiba ( Evangelical University Clinical Hospital ) . Patients 18 year age use formulation amphotericin B include . The data evaluate principal diagnosis ICD10 obtain admission discharge , total length stay , length hospital stay antifungal start , length stay initiation antifungal drug , formulation amphotericin B use , necessity amount dialysis . Also assess final outcome patient ( death cure ) . Other epidemiological data age gender evaluate . A cost analysis base total bill patient , cost antifungal , cost throughout dialysis procedure , cost laboratory test use monitor treatment amphotericin ( complete blood count , electrolytes , renal function , partial urine , function liver , electrocardiogram ) . The cost measure American Dollar . These data obtain similar study use cost antifungal invasive aspergillosis USA ( KIM 2011 ) . Data analyze accord type variable . Means median use continuous variable standard deviation . Statistical method compare mean median parametric non-parametric , well chi-square test dichotomous variable . The data consider statistically significant difference 5 % ( p &lt; 0.05 ) occur . Other multivariable method apply accord result . Informed consent necessary retrospective cohort data obtain medical chart , without intervention . Principal investigator co-investigator sponsor fill request . All survey fulfil investigator co-investigator . The survey attach end project . This study send ethic committee approval start .</detailed_description>
