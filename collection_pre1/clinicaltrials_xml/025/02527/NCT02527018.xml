	<brief_summary>Hypertensive disorder pregnancy include preeclampsia lead cause pregnancy related mortality United States . Timely appropriate management hypertensive disorder pregnancy critical prevent complication kidney failure , HELLP syndrome , disseminate intravascular coagulation , placental abruption , intrauterine fetal demise , intracranial bleed , coma death . ( HELLP syndrome group symptom occur inpregnant woman : H -- hemolysis ( breakdown red blood cell ) ; EL -- elevate liver enzymes ; LP -- low platelet count . ) Hypertensive disorder pregnancy include gestational hypertension ( HTN ) , chronic HTN , preeclampsia preexist HTN superimpose preeclampsia . Hypertensive disorder may also lead significant maternal and/or fetal morbidity . Based severity disease process gestational age fetus , decision need make whether proceed immediate delivery continue expectant management . Meanwhile , maintenance optimal blood pressure , blood volume , cardiac output recommend preserve placental perfusion prevent unfavorable maternal and/or fetal outcome . Previous study demonstrate blood flow difference pregnancy complicate preeclampsia vs. healthy pregnant woman evidence decreased arterial compliance , increase systemic vascular resistance load , change blood volume cardiac output . Additionally , various serum marker try identify woman preeclampsia . B-Type natriuretic peptide ( BNP ) consistently show elevated preeclampsia , serve marker heart function intra vascular volume status . Continuous hemodynamic monitoring may play crucial role timely management patient severe disease due dynamic nature disease process . Existing method preferred pregnancy due invasive nature , lack validated non-invasive mean provide real time information various hemodynamic parameter include cardiac output critically ill pregnant woman . Among new cardiac monitoring device , Nexfin device ( BMEYE , Amsterdam , Netherlands ) recently introduce . Nexfin device device approve Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) non-invasive reliable method continuous measure arterial blood pressure pregnant woman . However preliminary data preeclamptic patient use device . The standard care use sphygmomanometer blood pressure monitoring . Additionally study compare hemodynamics healthy preeclamptic woman use Nexfin device . Nexfin think superior available non-invasive method safe considerably accurate method . Nexfin provide continuous blood pressure , heart rate , cardiac output , stroke volume , systemic vascular resistance leave ventricular contractility index . The study aim determine non-invasive Nexfin device use reliably distinguish hemodynamics preeclamptic vs. healthy pregnant woman singleton pregnancy along use BNP level . Investigators aim recruit 33 healthy control 33 subject diagnose preeclampsia ( mild severe ) . Subject 's systolic diastolic blood pressure measure use Nexfin device standard sphygmomanometer ( blood pressure meter ) . Additionally hemodynamic measure : heart rate , cardiac output , stroke volume , systemic vascular resistance , leave ventricular contractility record use Nexfin device . Investigators perform blood draw measure BNP level additional assessment hemodynamic change two group .</brief_summary>
