	<detailed_description>Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ( RYGB ) one commonly perform bariatric procedure use treatment severe obesity . RYGB several study show result significant sustain weight loss . Moreover , RYGB beneficial effect obese subject type 2 diabetes improve blood glucose regulation , result remission partial remission type 2 diabetes already day surgery . The change anatomy stomach small intestine cause faster abrupt increase blood glucose meal . As consequence change glucose absorption RYGB increase insulin secretion , subject experience condition name postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia . Postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia typically see year RYGB symptom vary mild dizziness confusion , loss consciousness seizure . The condition characterize large postprandial blood glucose variation accompany exaggerated insulin glucagon-like peptide 1 ( GLP-1 ) responses . Continuous glucose monitoring ( CGM ) show subject suffer postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia present large variation blood glucose value 3.5 mmol/L diabetic value 11.1 mmol/L within first hour meal . At present , treatment guideline beside dietary recommendation . Experimental treatment include diet modification , pharmaceutical treatment surgical procedure . Several pharmaceutical agent attempted management postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia , overall exist study consist case report case series evaluate primarily relief symptom CGM hormonal analysis . The study design randomize , non-blinded cross-over study include five treatment arm . The pharmaceutical agent : ) Glucobay , b ) Januvia , c ) Verapamil , ) Victoza e ) Signifor . The treatment duration 1 - 3 week , except Signifor , administer one day . Each treatment period separate wash period 7-10 day . Sixteen none diabetic woman include study . They undergo RYGB symptom postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia . Moreover , former CGM show fluctuation blood glucose 5 mmol/L daily living least one blood glucose read 3.5 mmol/L . Six day continuous glucose monitoring perform run-in treatment arm , except e ) Signifor due short treatment period . At end CGM measurement meal tolerance test ( MTT ) perform . During MTT blood sample glucose measurement hormone assessment ( insulin , C-peptide , GLP-1 , gastric inhibitory peptide ( GIP ) , glucagon , insulin like growth factor ( IGF-1 ) , epinephrine , norepinephrine ) drawn continuously well continuous pulse record blood pressure measurement .</detailed_description>
