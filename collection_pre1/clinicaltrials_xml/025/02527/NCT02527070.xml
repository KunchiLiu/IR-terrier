	<detailed_description>Photoplethysmography ( PPG ) simple uncalibrated optical method monitoring variation skin blood volume . A major limitation PPG lack quantitative method calibrate signal . A method provide absolute measure ( time unit ) call 'minimum rise time ' ( MRT ) publish 1985 Dr. Benjamin Gavish , one study investigator . However , possible relationship MRT state arteriole determines microvascular flow never investigate . Such relationship , validate , could clinical impact noninvasive diagnosis vascular disease monitor microvascular response treatment affect clinic home setting . The objective current study investigate potential relationship variation MRT ( minimum rise time , time unit ) microcirculatory variable induce intervention expect acute effect state arteriole tissue oxygenation . This study include single 1-2 hour session per subject , PPG microvascular systemic variable monitor healthy volunteer response number non-invasive interventions/device approve clinical use know elicit microvascular response . These intervention apply consecutively , include breathe different rate , low power visible light red-to-near-infrared range , local temperature change . The experimental session conduct Afeka College study investigator .</detailed_description>
