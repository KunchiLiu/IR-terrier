	<brief_title>Evaluation Myocardial Iron Deposition Patients Heart Failure Using T2* MR Imaging</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Heart failure ( HF ) complex clinical syndrome result structural functional cardiac disorder impairs ability ventricle fill eject blood . In Taiwan , HF grow epidemic , owe age population increase survival patient present acute myocardial infarction various heart disease . The reported 5- 10-year mortality range 14 % 48.2 % impaired LVEF versus 14.1 % 24.4 % pre- serve LVEF , respectively . The diagnosis HF base symptom typical heart failure , sign typical heart failure objective evidence structural functional abnormality heart . Asymptomatic structural functional abnormality heart ( myocardial remodel ) usually progressive disorder consider precursor symptomatic heart failure . Therefore early diagnosis underlie etiology cause always seek guide suitable preventive treatment . Myocardial iron deposition lead progressive heart dysfunction think lead cause death transfusion-dependent anemia . Endomyocardial biopsy , use evaluate iron deposition heart , risky unacceptable sample variability . Non-invasive MR scan currently image method show reliable accurate ass myocardial iron loading . The application MR transverse relaxation time T2* successfully demonstrate quantitative assessment iron concentration heart . Purpose The objective project evaluate myocardial iron deposition patient heart failure ( HF ) . Deposition iron myocardium expect find patient heart failure induce cause rather transfusion-dependent hematological disorder . In longitudinal study , attempt analyze presence severity myocardial iron deposition , variation along course correlate clinical outcome patient HF . Methods This 3-year project human subject focus myocardial iron deposition . Direct myocardial iron measurement use endomyocardial biopsy risky unacceptable sample variability . Therefore MR T2* image chosen project due non-invasiveness T2* value quantitatively correlate severity myocardial iron overload . The inclusion criterion study : ( 1 ) heart failure patient diagnose Keelung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital ; ( 2 ) patient must ≥ 20 ≤ 70 year age ; ( 3 ) patient must willing undergo standard treatment follow Heart Failure Center ; ( 4 ) patient must able give informed consent . The exclusion criterion : ( 1 ) patient judge noncompliant treatment accessible follow ; ( 2 ) patient contraindication MR scanning , claustrophobia , cardiac pacemaker , metal implant , unable cooperate MRI study due mental status ; ( 3 ) Severe renal function impairment ( glomerular filtration rate le 30 mL/min/1.73m2 ) ; ( 4 ) pregnant breast-feeding ; ( 5 ) history open-heart surgery . Medical record eligible patient identify centrally review project joint meeting enrollment ensure study quality . 1. st year plan The first year cross-sectional study . By use T2* imaging , aim compare severity myocardial iron deposition normal subject stable HF patient recovery normal impaired ejection fraction ( EF ) . Total 60 subject enrol , group treat HF patient normal EF ( n=20 ) , group treat HF patient impaired EF ( n=20 ) , control group ( n=20 ) . The control group consist age gender match normal volunteer without previously document cardiac disease . In part , compare T2*value HF patient group normal group , two-sample equality test consider sample size chosen achieve 80 % power detect clinically meaningful difference level significance α=0.05 . The G*Power 3.1.4 software 4 utilized compute require sample size first year study . The two-independent-sample t-test effect size 0.74 , level significance α=0.05 , power 0.8 require total sample 60 participant ( 20 group ) . The clinically meaningful effect size set 0.74 accord small pilot study . 2. nd 3rd year In 2nd 3rd year , plan prospective longitudinal study 40 subject . Enrolled patient evaluated cardiac MR T2* image three time point , i.e. , disease onset , 6 month one year treatment , follow end project ( 1.5~3-year follow ) . Therefore total 120 MR scan perform 2nd 3rd year . The presence severity myocardial iron deposition correlate disease course , patient biochemistry data clinical outcome . MRI image data analysis Cardiac MRI perform 3-T MRI scanner intravenous administration gadolinium-based MR contrast medium HF subject , order identify ischemia foucs assess myocardial viability . For test subject , EF calculate Simpson disk summation method use short-axis cine steady-state free precession image leave ventricle ( LV ) previously report ( 12 ) . LV endocardial border semi-automated trace short-axis image obtain end-diastole end-systole determine ventricular cavity area slice . The area trace image slice multiply slice interval ( slice thickness plus image gap ) determine volume slice . The volume slice sum determine LV volume . LVEF determine end-diastolic volume ( EDV ) end-systolic volume ( ESV ) use follow equation : LVEF = stroke volume ( EDV - ESV ) ÷ EDV ……………………………………………… . ( 1 ) Iron myocardium quantify measure T2* ( 1/R2* ) , MR relaxation parameter show vary inversely tissue iron concentration . This technique high reproducibility inter-MRI scanner agreement . MRI measurement perform use 3-T clinical MRI scanner ( Skyra , Siemens AG ) new pulse sequence ( Multi Echo GRE , WIP 732 , Siemens ) . Myocardial T2* assess use single breath-hold multiecho technique . In brief , single 10-mm-thick short-axis mid-ventricular slice LV acquire 8 echo time standard shimming single breath-hold . For analysis , full-thickness region interest choose interventricular septum . The signal intensity region measure image use in-house design software ( CMRtools , Cardiovascular Imaging Solutions , London , UK ) . Statistical analysis plan Descriptive statistic calculate characteristic study subject . For continuous data , two-independent-sample t-test use test difference T2* value two group , method analysis variance ( ANOVA ) use assess difference 3 group . The non-parametric method Mann-Whitney U Kruskal-Wallis H use compare two group small sample size continuous variable follow normal distribution . The Pearson 's chi-square test use evaluate association variable . The Spearman 's rho test use correlate LVEF T2* value measure MRI . Expected problem difficulties One large hurdle overcome patient collection project involve clinical image follow . For close coordination researcher various department good operation patient , need in-house research assistant assure workflow data completeness . Because T2* high field decrease substantially quantitation vulnerable increase B0 inhomogeneity , especially challenge 3T . Therefore integrate commit , interdisciplinary team radiologist , MR physicists overcome challenge . To solve technical challenge accompany high field strength 3 Tesla system field inhomogenicity susceptibility artifact . Second-order shimming ( water peak line width , 4.7 Hz ) proven 3 Tesla MR system well first-order ( 16.5 Hz ) iterative shimming ( 18 Hz ) apply project improve correction air tissue susceptibility difference . Use instrument The MR T2* image study perform 3-Tesla Siemens Skyra MR system Keelung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital . There 60 scan 1st year , 120 scan 2nd 3rd year . In total 180 MR scan arrange 3 year . Given 45 work week per year , average 1.3 scan per week . Each cardiac MR study require 2 scan slot ( 2 hour ) plus post-processing time , charge one slot . The scanner time occupancy approve MRI regulation Department Radiology .</detailed_description>
