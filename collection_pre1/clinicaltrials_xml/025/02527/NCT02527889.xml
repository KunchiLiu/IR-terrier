	<brief_title>The Effect Resistive Exercise Forearm Blood Flow Tissue Oxygenation Among Breast Cancer Survivors With Risk Breast Cancer-related Lymphoedema ( BCRL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>160 subject diagnosis breast cancer , 80 80 without BCRL , recruit . Eligible subject Chinese ethnicity female breast cancer survivor , age young 70 year old body mass index less 30kg/m2 , remain disease free clinical diagnosis stable BCRL without BCRL . Subjects exclude bilateral unstable BCRL , define significant change arm receive intensive therapy ( i.e . decongestive therapy antibiotic infection ) within past 3 month , musculoskeletal , cardiovascular and/ neurological disorder could inhibit exercise . Primary outcome include brachial artery blood flow measure Doppler ultrasound device tissue oxygenation measure near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) . Additional outcome measure include arm circumference measurement , bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy , self-reported lymphoedema symptom survey , handgrip dynamometer strength testing , upper limb range motion measurement quality life measure use Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-Breast Cancer subscale ( FACT-B ) questionnaire obtain . All outcome measure assess affected contralateral unaffected arm subject pre-exercise , immediately post-exercise 3-month exercise . Comparison baseline measurement breast cancer survivor without BCRL obtain . Subjects randomly assign computer programme exercise group control group . Randomization stratify whether axillary dissection and/ axilla radiotherapy give . The exercise group receive supervise resistive exercise programme . Subjects exercise group attend small group-based exercise session twice week 8 week supervised physiotherapist . The duration exercise session last approximately 1 hour . Prior resistive exercise , subject perform warm movement large joint shoulder girdle 15 minute . Resistive exercise focus major muscle group upper body . Loading resistive exercise prescribe progressed accord individual capacity reach level moderate high loading ( 6 -12 repetition maximum ) . The subject also instruct perform stretching exercise specific muscle group train session . Symptoms response monitor use self-reported lymphoedema symptom survey exercise session . Rate perceive exertion also record immediately exercise session .</detailed_description>
