	<brief_summary>Cardiac arrest ( CA ) affect approximately 40,000 people France . It still major cause death young population . Management CA define international recommendation , detail learned society country . It include several link interconnect optimisation . Despite improvement , progress , little make survival CA victim past year industrialised country , survival rate France 3 % 5 % . Refractory cardiac arrest define failure , 30 minute specialise resuscitation . It use standard admit hope spontaneous cardiac activity satisfactory neurological recovery period , except case CA neuroprotection ( intoxication , hypothermia ) . External circulatory support `` extracorporeal membrane oxygenation '' ( ECMO ) make possible replace circulatory activity myocardium respiratory activity lung . In in-hospital cardiac arrest ( CA ) team use ECMO improvement survival rate 20 % comparison standard resuscitation . This use demonstrate possibility neurological recovery independent recovery spontaneous cardiac activity differ . These result encourage use ECMOs case out-of-hospital refractory cardiac arrest . Patients victim CA resuscitate 30 minute spot CA occur . They transfer specialise centre . The significant improvement survival note in-hospital CAs observe French series study concern out-of-hospital CAs . This survival currently estimate 4 % . This difference partly explain difference time begin cardiac massage implementation circulatory support ECMO ( `` low flow '' period ) . This time period directly correlate survival . To demonstrate superiority strategy term survival , investigator would like conduct randomise comparative study two strategy : 1 ) installation ECMO 20th minute 30 minute CA , directly site CA , emergency physician and/or specifically trained resuscitator 2 ) On-site resuscitation optimise secondary transfer hospital implementation support . The purpose increase 5 % 20 % survival victim out-of-hospital refractory cardiac arrest good neurological prognosis . Main objective : The hypothesis pre-hospital ECMO result survival 20 % patient , consider percentage survival in-hospital ECMO le 5 % . Main judgement criterion : Survival good neurological outcome ( CPC 1 2 ) discharge intensive care 6 month Secondary judgement criterion : Success rate implementation ECMO ECMO implementation time Immediate complication : haemorrhage , infection Number organ harvest The quality survivor ' neurological status accord CPC neurological classification D 28 , 2 month 1 year Predictive indicator prognosis cardiac arrest via cerebral biological monitoring Methodology , type study : This prospective randomise study current care Sample size ( SS , power , risk ) : A total number 105 patient group make possible demonstrate alpha risk 5 % power 1-β=90 % , significant difference favour early pre-hospital ECMO compare current practice in-hospital ECMO .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Comparative Study Between Pre-hospital In-hospital Circulatory Support Strategy ( ECMO ) Refractory Cardiac Arrest ( ACPAR2 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>1 STATUS OF THE QUESTION 2.1 Circumstances surround problem : 2.1.1 The limit conventional resuscitation cardiac arrest . Sudden adult death , unexpected cardiac arrest ( CA ) often relate cardiovascular cause , affect 40,000 people France every year . The prognosis out-of-hospital sudden death particularly sombre . Only 5 20 % patient survive without neurological sequel . This prognosis partially improve efficient organization management implement concept `` survival chain '' . An early alert witness CA , carry first intervention , cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) , defibrillation public person qualify first-aid , follow specialized resuscitation medical team ( ambulance service ) increase amount survivor . The reduction time pass first intervention ( call no-flow period ) duration resuscitation return spontaneous circulation ( ROSC ) call low-flow , consider primary predictive factor survival CA . Just recently , good knowledge post-cardiac arrest syndrome also contribute improvement prognosis quality survival . The introduction early angioplasty generalisation therapeutic hypothermia complete management cod steadily improve international national recommendation update every 5 year . However , order show capable , conventional management CA require spontaneous cardiac activity re-established quickly possible . Therefore , return spontaneous circulation ( ROSC ) must obtain field out-of-hospital sudden death . Classically , absence ROSC 30 minute correctly administer resuscitation , CA consider refractory treatment option limit . Just recently , show chance survival non-existent 16 minute resuscitation . In case , resuscitation discontinue patient declare dead spot . The regulatory inclusion physician ambulance service team relieve difficulty decision . It often simple make medically indisputable obvious prognostic factor unfavorable ( notably , extend no-flow period ) and/or condition ( advanced age , severe chronic disease , etc ... ) compatible prolonged resuscitation . This decision much difficult prognostic factor favorable prolonged resuscitation efficiently provide spontaneous circulation ( sign patient awake CPR ) . Under circumstance , France several European country , decision make continue extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) transport refractory CA victim . It make possible development mechanical external cardiac massage device Autopulse ® Lucas® enable prolonged cardiac compression transport emergency service . However , continuation resuscitation consider enable another subsequent treatment patient . Two option possible . The patient declare dead become potential organ donor framework organ harvest procedure patient `` cardiac death '' . This harvesting , highly organize accord regulation , do certain hospital authorize French Biomedicine Agency . Or , resuscitation prolong use extracorporeal circulatory support . 2.1.2 . The progress extracorporeal circulatory support cardiac arrest Circulatory support technique common use many year perioperatively cardiac surgery . One simplest form , extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) use often outside field , notably paediatrics care Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome ( ARDS ) refractory shock adult . This technique notably widely introduce general intensive care treatment malignant influenza affect young subject ( H1N1 virus ) . In parallel extension indication ECMO , technical development equipment major factor . ECMO device , particularly easy use , miniaturize energy autonomous , available . They make possible use ECMO inter-hospital transport ambulance helicopter . In France , several teach hospital therefore develop mobile team call mobile circulatory support unit ( UMAC ) enable implementation ECMO intensive care unit none , transport patient circulatory respiratory support reference center . 2.1.3 . The implementation extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) Cardiac Arrest ( CA ) It quickly become evident possibility artificial circulatory activity enable efficient perfusion oxygenate blood important CA victim whose heart stop beat . The first research , conduct primarily refractory CAs occur hospital setting , demonstrate unexpected possibility survival patient , without option would dead , resuscitation would stop . In 2003 Taiwan , Chen et al . noted survival rate almost 30 % series CAs occur hospital setting . In Caen , France , phenomenon note : survival 8 40 patient benefit ECMO follow refractory CA . This technique prove highly adapt cause CA potentially reversible . Mégarbane et al . note survival 3 12 victim CA follow acute intoxication cardiotoxic drug . In international recommendation , circulatory support still recommend paediatrics . However , indisputable success adult lead attempt rationalise use therapeutic ECMO France . The indication consider possible include existence hypothermia , intoxication , sign life Cardio-Pulmonary Ressucitation ( CPR ) , CPR ( low-flow ) less 100 minute . The development ECMO program treatment refractory CA demonstrate difference prognosis in-hospital out-of-hospital CAs . In-hospital CAs quickly benefit implementation ECMO . Out-of-hospital CA victim late access possibility resuscitation . In fact require resuscitation least 30 minute field consider refractory , follow transport mechanical massage arrival center ECMO . Le Guen et al . noted series patient victim sudden death Paris out-of-hospital setting , 2 51 patient survive good neurological condition . Most patient extend low-flow period implementation ECMO . A negative correlation duration resuscitation ECMO survival explain poor prognostic result . In addition , resuscitation prolong mechanical massage burden morbidity Agostinucci et al . emphasize . This negative influence access ECMO also note Chen et al . hospital setting . The prognosis rapidly decrease resuscitation prolong : 40 % survival resuscitation last less 30 minute ; 17 % surpass 60 minute . This difference survival in-hospital out-of-hospital CA also note another series French study ( Gay , AFAR abstract ) . The prognosis out-of-hospital CA even bad accompany prolonged CPR . Morbidity also high among patient . Cadarelli et al . include research case histories publish 2008 meta-analysis demonstrate harmful effect prolong CPR . In analysis , speed ECMO implement appear prognostic factor similar patient ' age total duration circulatory support . Therefore , ECMO start 30 minute CPR result decrease survival . Kilbaught et al . emphasize actually time factor make difference in-hospital out-of-hospital CAs . In pre-hospital emergency system , rapid transport patient CPR start ECMO upon arrival emergency service possible . With strategy , demonstrate difference prognosis in-hospital out-of-hospital CAs eliminate time implementation ECMO comparable . As result , ECMO use earlier earlier hospital Japan result currently publish appear positive survival . 2.1.4 The concept pre-hospital extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ( ECMO ) The analysis international literature show ECMO might management method improve survival CA victim . However , context out-of-hospital sudden death medicalised emergency system framework French regulation , two limit factor : - obligation resuscitation 30 minute categorically announce CA refractory whether choose another treatment option . - possibility access ECMO within close time period 30 minute Cardio-Pulmonary Ressucitation ( CPR ) , appear important threshold determine prognosis . Pre-hospital ECMO , basis research concept propose , include arterio-venous cannulation implementation extracorporeal system ( pump , oxygenator ) non-healthcare setting . It therefore different in-hospital transport patient ECMO since precede step take place hospital . The implementation ECMO hospital study rapid , approximately 20 minute Japanese study series accord experience . ECMO out-of-hospital refractory CAs subject clinical case , child sport event . Its feasibility ambulance service pre-hospital team confirm last study . The improvement survival early ECMO , close 30-minute period CPR also demonstrate . It base extrapolation result fast transport almost without specialised resuscitation victim sudden death close hospital ECMO . Confirmation concept therefore particular importance fact : - would provide prospect new treatment possibility patient whose chance survival extremely slim , prolonged CPR require access hospital ECMO . It essential step conduct multi-centre randomise study demonstrate beneficial effect survival . - would make possible stress pertinence French team ' approach field , notably comparison European country ( Germany , Spain , etc ... ) already medicalised pre-hospital emergency system , currently develop , like Japan . - finally , might also result good determination place therapeutic ECMO result , clarify indication organ harvest `` cardiac death '' victim pre-hospital sudden death . In brief , objective project evaluate advantage pre-hospital ECMO improve patient survival .</detailed_description>
