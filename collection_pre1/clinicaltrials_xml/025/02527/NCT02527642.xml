	<brief_title>Commercial Single Step ( Vitrolife -G-TLâ„¢ ) Media Compared With Cornell Media</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subjects undergo ovarian stimulation , oocyte retrieval , IVF , Intra Cytoplasmic Sperm Injection ( ICSI ) procedure follow center 's usual procedure . The cohort inject oocyte patient randomly divide one step sequential medias : CRM ( Cornell- Center Reproductive Medicine ) medium ( C1/C2 C3 ) v G-TL Time Lapse medium G-1/G-2 medium . Single step sequential medium buffer mediums culture oocyte fertilization blastocyst stage . Sequential medium formulate accord stage embryo development embryo re-cultured medias accord stage development . Single step ( time lapse ) medium formulate continuous culture D0 Day 5/6 . Mature oocytes randomized via non-bias computer program two four study group : G-TL commercial single step ( Vitrolife ) , Vitrolife 's sequential medium , Cornell 's single step , Cornell 's sequential medium . Oocytes divide randomly among various medium dependent upon number mature oocytes . I.e . : 10 oocyte inject = 2 medium group ; 15 oocyte inject = 3 medium group ; 20 oocyte inject = 4 medium group . `` Best grade '' embryo transfer regardless medium source . If embryos transfer multi-source medium researcher unable determine medium source transfer , subject include outcome data portion study- e.g pregnancy outcome . The Time-Lapse monitoring system use standard clinical practice observe development document time embryo cleavage morphology dynamic . Endpoints Day 3 Day 5/6 embryo development , implantation pregnancy rate . The study approximately 2 month , estimate time take physician perform one IVF-ART IVF- Assisted Reproductive Technology ) treatment cycle . If embryos frozen , patient may study time choose thaw embryo 1 year become pregnant .</detailed_description>
