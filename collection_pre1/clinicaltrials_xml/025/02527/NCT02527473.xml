	<brief_title>Improving Bystander CPR Quality Through Dispatcher-assisted Basic Life Support Education Program</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) crucial component survival out-of hospital cardiac arrest ( OHCA ) . Not rate bystander CPR associate high OHCA survival rate , quality bystander CPR measure proportion correct chest compression earlier administration highly indicative positive outcome well . However , bystander CPR rate report low many community due low access CPR training . To address , among many attempt improve OHCA survival , enhance bystander CPR rate quality dispatcher-assisted CPR ( DA-CPR ) right target group may effective promising approach . In DA-CPR , dispatcher emergency line provide CPR instruction phone . Over-the-telephone CPR instruction intend primarily benefit bystander little training , study show also benefit train bystander panic emergency situation prompt CPR administration . Trained bystander receive dispatcher assistance CPR also show improved CPR quality . Previous study report 50-81 % OHCA occur home . However , outcome private home poor compare outside private home include public place . One possible reason lower survival rate may current CPR education program home bystander inefficient properly educate home bystander provide quality CPR patient . In word , despite report benefit DA-CPR train untrained bystander , perform bystander CPR accord phone instruction provide dispatcher may easy follow certain home bystander woman elderly . According recent analysis 2012 National OHCA Registry , outcomes OHCA significantly low ( adjust odds ratio ; 0.36 , 95 % confidence interval ; 0.18-0.71 ) patient receive home bystander CPR dispatcher assistance patient receive either public receive home bystander CPR without dispatcher assistance . These result suggest home bystander CPR dispatcher assistance improve outcome due low compliance CPR instruction low CPR performance quality home bystander . Considering in-home OHCA patient less likely receive bystander CPR , need new approach optimize low compliance rate CPR quality possible home bystander .</detailed_description>
