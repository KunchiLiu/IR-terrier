	<brief_summary>Esophageal carcinoma lethal disease , cause 400,000 death annually worldwide . Primary surgery result microscopically positive resection margin ( R1 ) 25 % patient , 5-year overall survival ( OS ) patient rarely exceed 40 % . Concurrent chemoradiation follow surgery result well survival single-modality treatment , thus National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) recommend concurrent chemoradiation preoperative definitive treatment patient stage II III esophageal cancer . However , neoadjuvant chemoradiation may effective subgroup patient , toxicity increase perioperative mortality delay preclude surgery . The ability distinguish tumor respond respond therapy remain urgent priority . Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging ( DW-MRI ) base extent mobility water proton , quantify apparent diffusion coefficient ( ADC ) . The ADC measure extent free diffusion water molecule within tissue , mainly influence cell organization , size , density . Cell death lead loss cell membrane integrity density lead increase ADC value . The ADC emerge potential biomarker response cancer therapy . However , one publish finding regard potential correlation change ADC response esophageal cancer chemoradiation . Clarifying potential predictive value DW-MRI predict response therapy important delivery appropriately tailor treatment . Investigators hypothesize DW-MRI predict success ( failure ) neoadjuvant chemoradiation esophageal squamous cell carcinoma（ESCC） , hence identify patient high risk treatment failure therapy . Investigators test hypothesis two specific aim : ( 1 ) ass ability ADC predict pathologic response treatment ; ( 2 ) ass ability ADC predict disease-free survival overall survival .</brief_summary>
