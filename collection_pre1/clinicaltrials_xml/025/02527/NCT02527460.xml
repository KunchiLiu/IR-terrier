	<brief_summary>Background : HIV sometimes cause HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder , HAND . HAND HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder . It affect memory , thinking , concentration . It cause mood change . HAND may cause HIV hide central nervous system cause inflammation . Researchers want see drug inflammation ( Anakinra ) help people HIV . Objective : To see drug inflammatory diseases safe people HIV-infection antiretroviral therapy . Eligibility : Adults 18-61 year old HIV enrol another study . Design : Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood urine test . Participants 15 study visit 16 week . At study visit 1 , participant : - Screening test repeat . - Brain magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) scan . They lie table slide metal cylinder strong magnetic field . They get dye insert thin plastic tube vein . - Lumbar puncture . The low back numb . A needle collect fluid bone back . - Tests memory , thinking , attention . Participants may also fill form task . Participants learn inject study drug . Over 8 week , give study drug home every day . They 3 injection . They write injection side effect . Participants 5 weekly visit take study drug . They answer question blood drawn . At week 8 16 , visit repeat visit 1 .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Anakinra , A Recombinant Human IL-1 Receptor Antagonist Neuroinflammation HIV-1 Infection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Objective : HIV persist reservoir brain several different cell type , include macrophage , microglia astrocyte , reservoir persists even antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) suppress virus blood . This viral persistence CNS think cause neuroinflammation release inflammatory cytokine chemokines . HIV-infected patient evidence neuroinflammation CSF likely cognitive impairment even virus optimally treat ART . This cognitive impairment , currently name HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder ( HAND ) , affect 20-37 % HIV-infected ART-treated population . Without ART , rate severe HAND incredibly high , current era area ART widely available , cognitive deficit often subtle . Despite reduction degree impairment few case overt dementia , patient HAND poor medication adherence , problem decision making , vocational disability , overall reduce quality life compare HIV-infected patient without cognitive impairment . This phase 1 study anakinra investigate safety anakinra patient HIV antiretroviral therapy . Anakinra , IL-1 receptor antagonist broad anti-inflammatory effect , demonstrate safety efficacy two inflammatory disease ( rheumatoid arthritis neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disorder ) FDA-approved . It yet use patient HIV infection . Study Population : The study conduct simultaneously two center : NIH Clinical Center Johns Hopkins University ( JHU ) Department Neurology enroll twelve participant HIV infection antiretroviral therapy . Approximately half patient enrol site . The study enroll patient evidence dementia . Design : This single-arm , open-label study anakinra . Participants self-administer daily injection anakinra 8 week . The dose increase first four week minimize injection site reaction . Participants evaluate prior first dose anakinra , weekly first five week , end anakinra administration , 8-week follow-up period without anakinra . Patients enrol NIH complete visit . Patients enrol JHU complete visit exception three study MRI complete NIH . Outcome Measures : Safety assess throughout 8 week treatment 8-week followup period . The anti-inflammatory effect anakinra explore analysis cerebrospinal fluid magnetic resonance image result treatment .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA Age 1861 year old Laboratoryconfirmed HIV1 infection CD4 count &gt; 350 cells/mm^3 Plasma HIV RNA &lt; 50 copies/mL least 12 month prior screen . Participants viral blip 200 copies/mL may include precede follow VL &lt; 50 copies/mL . Stable antiretroviral therapy regimen great equal 3 month prior screen Weight great equal 50 kg Have participate NIH protocol 13 N0149 JHU Clinical Outcomes Core Completion least 7th grade ( accord subject report ) ability speak , read , understand English allow use standard neurocognitive battery An establish primary care provider Willingness blood CSF sample store future research Willingness undergo serial lumbar puncture ( LPs ) per study schedule Willingness undergo genetic testing For woman childbearing potential , willingness use 2 form effective birth control begin 2 week continue 12 week start anakinra . One method must condom may diaphragm cervical cap spermicide , oral contraceptive , implant , contraceptive patch , IUD place least 3 month ago male partner vasectomy least 3 month ago . EXCLUSION CRITERIA Presence neurologic condition would confound study evaluation ( eg , multiple sclerosis , Parkinson disease ) . Neurologic condition would interfere study evaluation ( eg , migraine , peripheral neuropathy ) allow . Presence condition , HAND , associate cognitive impairment ( e.g . untreated severe sleep apnea ) screen Presence HIVassociated dementia determine participation NIH protocol 13N0149 JHU Clinical Outcomes Core Inability provide inform consent Past current psychiatric illness may interfere protocol adherence ( eg schizophrenia bipolar disorder ) Use psychiatric medication unless stable great equal 3 month time screen Current asthma require treatment History AIDSdefining opportunistic infection past two year history CNS opportunistic infection History lymphoma melanoma Any medical condition ( eg , congestive heart failure , coronary artery disease , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , severe osteoarthritis ) would make frequent study visit travel difficult participant Positive urine drug screen active abuse illegal drug , narcotic alcohol determine study investigator time screen baseline evaluation Women pregnant actively seek become pregnant Women breastfeeding Use systemic immunosuppressive medication , include TNF inhibitor , within five half life drug prior screen Contraindications LP include : International Normalized Ratio ( INR ) &gt; 1.5 , platelet &lt; 100,000/Microlitre , inability temporarily discontinue aspirin 710 day nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug 3 day prior LP Aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &gt; 2.5x laboratory upper limit normal Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 1000/mm^3 hemoglobin &lt; 10mg/dL Estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt; 60 mL/min history renal dialysis Other laboratory abnormality would make study risky patient determine study investigator Acute chronic hepatitis C virus infection determine detectable VL Acute chronic hepatitis B determine detectable hepatitis B surface antigen ( HbsAg ) hepatitis B core antibody ( HbcAb ) IgM History tuberculosis ( TB ) , positive TB test screening ( QuantiFERON tuberculin skin test ) Other infection ( eg , influenza , urinary tract infection ) would affect response anakinra , would represent risk significant infection base upon know effect anakinra , likely effect anakinra population . Receipt live vaccine within four week start anakinra plan within three month study completion Contraindication MRI include pacemaker implant electrical device , brain stimulators , type dental implant , type aneurysm clip ( metal clip wall large artery ) , type metallic prosthesis ( include metal pin rod , heart valve , cochlear implant ) , permanent eyeliner , shrapnel fragment . Participants require sedation claustrophobia MRI exclude . Known hypersensitivity contraindication gadolinium component anakinra Participation clinical protocol ( e.g . antiinflammatory drug intervention study ) include intervention may affect result current study . Any condition would increase risk subject would interfere subject ability comply protocol requirement ( e.g . inability travel study site frequently ) .</criteria>
