	<brief_summary>The investigator plan establish efficacy novel breathing-based mindfulness training ( BBMT , much simplify , easy-to-use version standard MM ) problem drinking , test whether impulsivity mediates effect among sample student problem drinker ( i.e. , &gt; 8 AUDIT , problem drinking Screening Test ) . The specific aim pilot study follow : 1. modify develop easy-to-use BBMT program directly target impulsivity produce indirect reduction problem drinking among college student ; 2. investigate feasibility preliminary efficacy apply BBMT reducing problem drinking pilot randomize control trial ( RCT ) ; 3. examine change impulsivity , measure behavioral self-report assessment , one possible mediator effect BBMT problem drinking , control change perceive stress anxiety .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Changing Impulsivity With Mindful Breathing Therapy Reduce Problem Drinking</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>An efficacious strategy address problem substance use among college student drinker target core risk factor . Arguably one clearly document risk factor problem drinking among college student impulsivity , relationship hold across various dimension impulsivity . Available evidence support importance intervene impulsivity limit problem drinking among college student , proven treatment dimension impulsivity . This notable lack may due traditional view impulsivity unchangeable personality trait . However , recent research suggest personality change sensitive behavior manipulation . As result clear need novel approach target core change individual behavior pattern . Mindfulness meditation ( MM ) unique option direction MM especially useful reduce impulsive behavior include problem drinking , exact role affect different dimension impulsivity effect change problem drinking yet explore . Based evidence recent study , well pilot work , investigator hypothesize one mechanism MM reduce problem drinking among college student lessen impulsivity - moreover , focus change college student problem drink do without explicit focus drink behavior . The specific aim Stage 1 therapy development study : 1 ) modify develop breathing-based mindfulness therapy ( BBMT ) reduce impulsivity problem drinking among college youth ; 2 ) investigate feasibility preliminary efficacy apply BBMT reducing problem drinking pilot randomize control trial ( RCT ) ; 3 ) examine change impulsivity , measure behavioral self-report assessment , one possible mediator observe effect BBMT problem drinking . These aim achieve two phase . In Phase 1 investigator expand fully develop exist BBMT program manual determine effective treatment dosage problem drinking impulsivity open label trial ( n = 10 ) . Using modified treatment material Phase 1 , Phase 2 investigator conduct RCT compare effect modify BBMT Supportive Counseling + Progressive Muscle Relaxation ( SC + PMR ) control condition ( n = 36 ) problem drinking , assessed baseline , week 4 8 , 3-month follow-up . Other potential mediator perceive stress anxiety also examine final model . This study great potential implication reach college student drinker less willing acknowledge drinking problem address core vulnerability ( impulsivity ) among at-risk student manner limit stigma may reduce resistance change . A diverse team experience mindfulness , impulsivity behavior therapy development assemble conduct propose R34 project prepare full therapy development study future .</detailed_description>
