	<brief_title>Immunity After Two Doses Yellow Fever Vaccine</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Data Collection Volunteers invite participate bringing card ( ) vaccination copy ( ) record ( ) appear ( ) ( ) dose ( ) receive yellow fever vaccine ( ) ( ) ( ) date ( ) . Individuals agree participate study sign Informed Consent Form forward interview application Inclusion Questionnaire , identify possible eligible study classify accord time vaccination . Then medical review history vaccination date age occur , city period live relevant pathological history , hospitalization treatment chronic disease take , proceed blood collection . Upon completion subject 's participation research study , registration must do closing participate study .A group volunteer previously vaccinate dose yellow fever vaccine booster indicate activity area vaccine recommend , constitute group 110 patient different search approach , pickup perform Whole blood analysis cellular immune 30-45 day revaccination . The clinical form study prepared process `` TELEform `` program , enable digitization preparation database . Sample Size Whereas 98 % seropositivity presence cellular response 30 day revaccination reference , 110 volunteer need group detect minute difference 10 percentage point 80 % power significance level 5 % . A total 440 volunteer 110 distribute group . Samples 110 individual estimate proportion seropositive 50 % precision 9 percentage point side . Biological Samples Samples initially obtain 10 ml peripheral blood collect without anti-coagulant serology , volunteer ( N = 440 ) . For subset 200 subject ( 50 group ) also collect 20 ml blood heparin ( 10 mL 2 tube ) determination cellular immunity . Specifically reference group , collection 20ml hold two different time , first visit return visit , 30 45 day revaccination . Laboratory test Titration neutralize antibody ( PRNT ) : neutralize antibody titer volunteer determine neutralization test 50 % reduction plaque lysis buffer ( PRNT50 ) monolayers Vero cell . For neutralization test PRNT dosage antibody express milli- International Units per milliliter ( mlU / ml ) serum . In subsample 20 % individual , subalíquota serum separate review PRNT yellow fever order allow verification serological test perform another team . ELISA : Serological test ( IgG ) dengue hold . These sample test IgG -ELISA confirmation antiamarílicos antibody sera vaccinated people . Additionally , level IgG antibodies serum conventional method collect volunteer compare data literature perform . Presence cellular immunity : Aliquots 20 mL whole blood collect tube contain sodium heparin anticoagulant ( Vacutainer , BD , USA ) culture peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) . Monitoring adverse event As administration vaccine research activity , record post-vaccination adverse event do professional administer vaccine accordance Manual Epidemiological Surveillance Adverse Events Following Immunization , 2nd . Edition - 2009 , Ministry Health , research monitor post-yellow fever vaccination serious adverse event , Ministry Health Statistical Analysis The response variable interest titer neutralize antibody ( mIU / mL ) serum transform logarithms base 10 . The serological status variable derive - seropositive : antibody titer equal great 2.8 log10 mIU / mL ; seronegative : security equal less 2.6 log10 mIU / mL , indeterminate : security equal 2.7 log10 mIU / mL . The proportion seropositivity geometric mean antibody titer estimate ( correspond 95 % confidence ) study group : revaccinated 30 day vaccinate two dos 1-5 year , 6 year vaccinate three dos . The seropositivity profile cellular immunity subgroup individual revaccinated thirty day take reference comparison group . The serological cellular immunity subgroup profile second vaccination also use reference comparison . The covariates analysis : age ( continuous variable year ) last dose yellow fever vaccine , sex , presence antibody dengue vaccination history , history severe illness ( hospitalization , sequela , disability ) co-morbidity ( use drug time blood sample ) .</detailed_description>
