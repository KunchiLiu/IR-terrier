	<brief_summary>This study evaluate induction therapy carfilzomib-cyclophosphamide-dexamethasone salvage high-dose melphalan autologous stem cell support ( HDT ) multiple myeloma patient relapse HDT do diagnosis . In addition , study evaluates effect maintenance therapy salvage HDT multiple myeloma . After salvage HDT half patient receive maintenance therapy carfilzomib/dexamethasone half observe without maintenance therapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Carfilzomib Multiple Myeloma Relapsed After High-dose Melphalan With Autologous Stem Cell Support</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The survival young myeloma patient improved ninety introduction high-dose melphalan autologous stem cell support ( HDT ) despite emergence novel therapy HDT remain keystone myeloma treatment . However , patient eventually experience relapse HDT perform diagnosis . Eligible patient late relapse consider salvage HDT . The duration response salvage HDT study report approximately half length response initial HDT . The choice induction treatment HDT might affect outcome induction therapy well outcome HDT . In setting novel proteasome inhibitor Carfilzomib show superiority first-in-class proteasome inhibitor bortezomib . In addition , carfilzomib favourable profile side effect . Thus , aim phase 2 study evaluate induction therapy carfilzomib-cyclophosphamide-dexamethasone salvage HDT . The primary end-point part study comparison time progression initial HDT time progression salvage HDT four series carfilzomib-cyclophosphamide-dexamethasone use induction therapy . In study Carfilzomib also include condition regimen administration Iv carfilzomib 27 mg/sqm day -2 -1 . The standard conditioning regime consist Iv melphalan 200 mg/sqm day -2 reinfusion least 2.0 x 10m CD34+ stem cells/kg body weight day 0 . The purpose maintenance therapy multiple myeloma prolong time progression disease . There limited data impact maintenance therapy salvage HDT . Another important aim study therefore evaluate effect carfilzomib/dexamethasone give every week compare observation without maintenance therapy . This part study start two month HDT . The randomization stratify accord relapse 1 - 2 year &gt; 2 year HDT , ISS stage standard versus high-risk cytogenetics . The primary end-point part study comparison time progression carfilzomib-dexamethasone maintenance arm observational arm . Patients continue maintenance therapy/observation progression , end study fulfil standard criterion discontinuation treatment accord protocol . The study include 200 patient relapse multiple myeloma one year initial HDT . It prerequisite patient least 2.0 x 10m CD34+ stem cells/kg body weight saved freezer . The study conduct Nordic Myeloma Study Group ( NMSG ) clinic Denmark , Sweden , Norway , Finland Lithuania . The first patient include January 2015 enrolment expect continue December 2017 . The study end last included patient follow 9 month randomization .</detailed_description>
