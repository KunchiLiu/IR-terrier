	<brief_summary>In human , 2 % couple experiment Recurrent pregnancy loss ( RPL ) . Currently , etiological investigation perform , 40 50 % RPL unexplained . In animal ' study , several study underline importance sperm quality normal embryo development . In human , epidemiological study demonstrate several male risk factor effect development ( male mediate development toxicology ) . However , study explore sperm DNA fragmentation embryo development vitro fertilization . In natural pregnancy rare study perform different population definition different method sperm exploration . In context sperm DNA fragmentation exploration appear justified . The present study purpose conduct case - control study order research paternal role RPL .</brief_summary>
