	<brief_summary>This study test experimental drug `` THR-18 '' give together drug `` tissue plasminogen activator '' treatment stroke . Tissue plasminogen activator also call `` tPA '' . Strokes often result blockade blood supply cause blood clot form within blood vessel feed brain . Such stroke call `` Ischemic stroke '' . Treatment stroke aim break blood clot ( ) renew blood flow part brain die . Breaking blood clot possible drug tPA inject vein shortly stroke start . However , along break blood clot , tPA sometimes cause adverse effect , example , may cause bleed . THR-18 , drug test study , meant reduce tPA 's adverse effect without stop tPA 's break block blood clot . The aim study evaluate safety THR-18 acute ischemic stroke patient treat parallel tPA , measure tPA 's effect blood clot dissolution drug give without THR-18 , study effect THR-18 may signal brain damage see brain computerized tomography ( type brain x-ray ) treatment tPA without THR-18 . Patients also evaluate ability perform daily activity stroke follow tPA treatment without THR-18 . The evaluation THR-18 study do comparison placebo . Placebo drug look exactly like THR-18 activity . One dose THR-18 test , 20 patient . In parallel , 20 patient receive placebo . In total , 40 patient plan participate study . The decision whether patient receive THR-18 placebo base chance ( procedure call `` randomization '' ) . This clinical study conduct one hospital , Republic Moldova . The patient hospital least 3 day receive study treatment . Then , 1 month later , invite last follow-up visit .</brief_summary>
