	<detailed_description>This study investigational surgical procedure treatment achalasia inability smooth muscle move food esophagus . Standard care participant include Heller Myotomy , laparoscopic procedure include cut muscle layer low esophageal sphincter ( LES ) valve bottom esophagus . A second procedure require prevent reflux ( acid enter esophagus stomach ) call fundoplication . Patients Heller myotomy typically stay overnight hospital . A new procedure , call POEM procedure ( per oral endoscopic myotomy ) develop achalasia . This procedure use endoscopy incision cut one muscle layer . A fundoplication require method . This study treatment work enter surgical area mouth make incision ( cut ) esophagus place flexible instrument along outside esophagus LES tunnel . The instrument use procedure standard endoscopic instrument provide one lead endoscopic instrument manufacturer , Olympus . The investigator recently complete small study show procedure safe feasible . One observation pilot study patient pain n't need pain medication . Due reason , investigator think patient 's may go home day procedure .</detailed_description>
