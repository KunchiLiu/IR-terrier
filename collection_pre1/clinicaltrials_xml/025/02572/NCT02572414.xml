	<brief_summary>African American men infect HIV living longer acquire chronic non-communicable disease affect general population African American men age 40 year old . African American men disproportionately high rate cardiovascular disease , hypertension , diabetes , kidney disease , cancer , particularly prostate colon cancer , HIV associate increase risk co-morbidity condition , risk heighten HIV infection , also treatment antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) . The risk many chronic disease tie behavior : risk increase physical inactivity unhealthful diet . Although high risk behavior-linked chronic disease among HIV-positive individual recognize , lack evidence-based intervention specifically tailor need . Hence , broad objective research identify strategy empower HIV positive African American men engage behavior reduce risk chronic disease . This research test efficacy theory-based , contextually appropriate health promotion intervention induce positive change behavior link risk chronic disease among HIV positive African American men age 40 year old identify theoretical variable mediate efficacy . In randomized controlled trial , African American HIV positive men age 40 old receive ART HIV randomize Men Together Making Difference Health Promotion Intervention , consist three , 3-hour weekly intervention session , 1 session Health Awareness Control Group . The Men Together Making Difference Health Promotion Intervention base social cognitive theory reason action approach integrate formative research . Data collect baseline , immediately post , 3 , 6 12 month post intervention . The trial test whether Men Making Difference Health Promotion Intervention increase self-reported physical activity compare Health Awareness Control Group .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>African Americans heavily burden preventable treatable disease , include cardiovascular disease , stroke , hypertension , diabetes , HIV/AIDS , sexually transmit disease ( STDs ) , cancer . African Americans high age-adjusted death rate heart disease , cancer , diabetes , HIV/AIDS compare Americans . The broad objective research identify strategy empower African American men engage healthful behavior effort help eliminate health disparity . Specifically , research address urgent need health promotion intervention target African American men live HIV . Despite high risk cardiovascular disease behavior-linked disease , include diabetes certain cancer , study develop tested intervention encourage behavior reduce risk chronic disease African American HIV positive men , sub-group comprise large segment people live HIV US . Moreover , irrespective race sex , study test intervention increase behavior reduce risk chronic disease people live HIV . From 2005 2007 , estimate number person live HIV rise steadily 37 state confidential name-based HIV infection reporting . At end 2007 , estimate 580,371 person state live HIV infection , include 48 % African-American 73 % men . In 2008 , African Americans account 52 % new diagnosis HIV infection 37 state confidential name-based reporting . The estimated rate diagnosis HIV high African American men ( 132 per 100,000 ) White men ( 17 per 100,000 ) , Hispanic men ( 52 per 100,000 ) , African American woman ( 56 per 100,000 ) . In Philadelphia , study conduct , two-thirds people live HIV/AIDS African American 2008 , two-thirds male , one-half age 45 year old . Since antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) available , durable suppression HIV replication , prevention AIDS-defining opportunistic infection malignancy , high survival life expectancy rate people live HIV . In US , 67 % people live HIV 2007 age 40 older . Because age HIV positive population , several chronic non-HIV-related condition become increasingly important clinical treatment HIV . Several review draw attention prevention control chronic disease , include diabetes mellitus cardiovascular , liver , kidney disease , affect people live HIV . Mounting evidence suggest HIV disease treatment ART accelerate risk chronic disease associate age , particularly cardiovascular disease diabetes mellitus . Studies indicate HIV-infected patient live long , increase experience mortality cause directly attributable HIV . For instance , among people HIV , proportion death directly attributable HIV increase age 36 % among 30-year old 53 % among 40-year old 72 % among 50-year old . Quite apart HIV infection , African Americans high mortality rate cardiovascular disease , cerebrovascular disease , diabetes Whites . Some evidence also suggest rate hypertension kidney disease high among HIV-infected African Americans among HIV-infected Whites . Indeed , cohort study , incidence end-stage renal disease people without HIV diabetes 2.3 time higher among African Americans Whites , diabetes HIV 2.3 time higher among African Americans Whites , whereas HIV diabetes , 8.1 time higher among African Americans compare Whites . African Americans also high mortality rate shortest survival rate cancer racial/ethnic group US . The death rate colon cancer , third common cancer among African Americans , decrease past 15 year , incidence mortality rate still disproportionately high among African Americans , particularly men . The colon cancer incidence African American men 1.21 time higher White men 1.31 time higher African American woman , mortality rate African American men 1.44 time higher White men 1.42 time higher African American woman . The poor survival rate colon cancer African American men link later stage diagnosis less access appropriate timely treatment . Studies show regular physical activity physical fitness associate reduce risk early mortality , cardiovascular disease , diabetes mellitus , colon cancer . Consuming fruit vegetable associate low risk cardiovascular disease certain cancer , 35 % African Americans report consume fruit recommend 2 time per day 24 % report consume vegetable recommend 3 time per day . These finding underscore need intervention encourage physical activity fruit vegetable consumption among African Americans . Screening important detect diseases early stage , African Americans less likely Whites report screen colon cancer . Reinhold et al . find , despite significantly visit primary care provider , HIV-infected patient age 50 year old less likely ever screen colon cancer age- gender-matched HIV-negative control , Bini et al . report HIV-infected individual high prevalence colonic neoplasm develop advanced neoplasm young age uninfected individual . Few study examine health behavior among HIV positive individual , few still test efficacy intervention target behavior link chronic disease . This research address gap literature . It test whether health promotion intervention increase physical activity healthful behavior compare health-awareness control group . The participant HIV positive African American men age 40 year old ART patient . Participants recruit Clinical Registry Penn Center AIDS Research , AIDS clinic service organization , HIV care provider , advertisement local newspaper , word mouth participant . The study utilize randomize controlled trial design . Computer-generated random number sequence use randomly assign men Men Together Making Difference Health Promotion Intervention Health Awareness Control Intervention . The theoretical basis Men Together Making Difference Health Promotion Intervention social cognitive theory reason action approach . The intervention seek increase self-efficacy , outcome expectancy , behavioral skill , risk-reduction knowledge behavior link cardiovascular disease , hypertension , diabetes , cancer , include physical activity , fruit vegetable consumption , fat consumption , colon-cancer screening . The intervention help men assess health behavior , identify personal barrier engage behavior , develop strategy surmount barrier , gain support behavior change . Participants complete assessment intervention , immediately post 3 , 6 , 12 month post-intervention . Self-report measure collect use audio computer-assisted self-interviewing . The primary outcome binary variable indicate whether participant meet 2008 Department Health Human Services physical activity guideline engage muscle-strengthening activity 2 day engage either 20 min vigorous-intensity activity least 4 day 30 min moderate-intensity activity least 5 day previous 7 day . The study test whether Men Together Making Difference Health Promotion Intervention increase adherence physical activity guideline post-intervention period compare Health Awareness Intervention control group whether social cognitive theory reason action approach variable mediate effect intervention . A power analysis use calculate sample size need detect clinically significant difference adherence physical activity guideline 9.1 percent , relative increase 58.0 % . Based sample HIV positive men age 40 old Project Eban , estimate correlation among physical activity guideline adherence rate 3- , 6-month , 12-month follow-up intraclass correlation ( ICC ) = 0.314 . Assuming 2-tailed test , alpha = 0.05 , ICC = 0.314 , 20 % attrition , 9.1 % increase physical activity guideline adherence 15.7 % control group 24.8 % health promotion intervention group , total N 384 men enrol yield statistical power 0.82 .</detailed_description>
