	<brief_summary>This study objective compare high sensitive troponin-I level end-stage renal disease patient receive hemodialysis without acute cardiovascular event healthy population . The investigator also determine effect hemodialysis troponin I level secondary objective .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study High Sensitive Troponin-I Level End-stage Renal Disease Patients Receiving Hemodialysis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human cardiac Troponin I ( cTnI ) composition Troponin find heart muscle cell . Molecular weight cTnI 23,875 Dalton consist 209 amino acid . [ 1,2 ] The cTnI use diagnosis acute myocardial infarction ( AMI ) . [ 3,4,5 ] According ESC / ACCF / AHA / WHF , diagnosis acute myocardial infarction rely data clinical symptom , Electrocardiogram ( EKG ) change specific pattern , ST-segment elevation / depression , new leave bundle branch block , cardiac biomarker level rise 99th percentile upper reference limit , make cTnI level use help make diagnosis patient come symptom angina emergency room . The current cTnI detect test develop high sensitive ( call `` high-sensitive troponin-I ; hsTnI '' ) detect range 10-50,000 pg / ml ( ng / L ) [ 6 ] , detect cTnI level even normal people unlike cTnI , report positive negative low limit detection . Due ARCHITECT stat High sensitive Troponin-I ( Abbott diagnostic ) capability , hsTnI level detect normal people 96 percent . [ 7 ] The reference range hsTnI research Apple FS , et al . ( 2012 ) study 19 type cardiac troponin I T measurement establish . The 99th percentile value general healthy population without hypertension , diabetes , kidney disease myocardial infarction , age 18-64 year 36 ng / L men ( N = 272 ) , 15 ng / L woman ( N = 252 ) [ 7 ] . However , research find reference hsTnI group , especially patient kidney disease still limited diagnosis acute myocardial infarction also use 99th percentile reference source research healthy population [ 7 ] make difficult interpret . Sometimes doctor may conclude patient rise hsTnI kidney disease . According research next section , support idea . Therefore , researcher aim study hsTnI patient end-stage renal disease receive hemodialysis compare normal population .</detailed_description>
