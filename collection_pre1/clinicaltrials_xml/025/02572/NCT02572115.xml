	<brief_title>Differentiated Access Out-of-hours Primary Care Through Emergency Access</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients call Danish out-of-hours primary care service ( OOH-PC ; i.e . lægevagt ) Medical Helpline 1813 ( i.e . Akuttelefonen ) queue telephone wait line . Ranging patient call acute illness chest pain parent call ask cough child well enough go day care next day , must wait turn talk triage general practitioner ( GP ) triage nurse . This Project part PhD-project composition two different randomise controlled study overlap background . This registration www.clinicaltrials.gov concern follow study : - Intervention bypass telephone queue case perceive emergency : The investigator implement option patient bypass telephone queue press button perceive illness acute severe . Background : Acute out-of-hours ( OOH ) care important part health care point entrance health care system many patient , contact outside normal working hour ( i.e . 4 pm 8 weekday , weekend , bank holiday ) . Patients acute health problem several option access health care system , OOH-PC , 112-Emergency Medical Communication Centre ( 112-EMCC ) , Medical Helpline 1813 . These setting complementary aim deliver health care , time patient population partly overlap . Primary care often first point contact , also outside office hour . However , Capital Region Denmark patient call Helpline 1813 answer triage nurse option forward call doctor , triage consultation emergency department ( ED ) another hospital department , order home visit , forward call 112-EMCC give telephone health advice . In four region OOH-PC run GPs , answer triage telephone call . They triage telephone advice , clinic consultation , home visit , directly refer ED/hospital . Patients contact OOH-PC Helpline 1813 put hold wait telephone queue GP nurse available answer call . The Danish acute care setting intend provide care different patient group depend upon nature severity health problem . With decision contact specific setting , patient choose point access acute care , thus influence care pathway . An ` inappropriate´ choice may result serious delay treatment insufficient intensive care , example contact primary care instead 112-EMCC life-threatening case . On contrary , over-use -treatment potential risk call 112-EMCC minor problem . At moment , patient call OOH-PC Helpline 1813 , wait line , even health problem experience highly urgent life-threatening . The alternative wait line call 112-EMCC instead , possibility bypass telephone wait line . In Netherlands functionality integrate telephone system , mean patient jump wait line connect first available telephone triage professional . No information available number patient whose safety compromise extensive waiting . The investigator also lack knowledge number patient decide contact another health care service , 112-EMCC , due wait time OOH-PC Helpline 1813 . At OOH-PC 5 % patient estimate condition potentially life-threatening approximately 1 % telephone contact directly triaged 112-EMCC . In Central Denmark Region account approximately 7,000 patient contact per year may experience potential harm delay consequence telephone queue . Although clear whether absence possibility jump line problem patient , presence may provide patient feel safety reduce level stress medical situation experience distress . Aim : To implement jump-the-line option OOH-PC Medical Helpline 1813 : 1. study frequency patient jump line general characteristic patient , 2. study patient ' reason jump line satisfaction option , 3. evaluate amount jump assess relevant triage GP/nurse Methods Design , set intervention : The investigator conduct randomise control trial ( RCT ) OOH-PC Central Denmark Region Helpline 1813 Capital Region . The two setting use investigator make comparison usage jump-option two region hopefully well-founded recommendation regard intervention . At moment , call , patient already routinely asked press CPR number telephone . Hereafter , patient randomize two arm accord date birth ( even uneven date month ) part Social security number ( Central Person Register , CPR number ) . For intervention arm , message answer machine inform patient possibility jump wait line press ' 9 ' . By call answer next available triage person . On computer screen triage person message appear , patient use jump option . Patients control arm get normal message answer machine get possibility jump line . If patient call several time study period randomize arm every time , use CPR number . If patient press CPR number , get normal message answer machine without option jump line . Data collection : A questionnaire pop-up PC triage GPs Central Region Denmark triage nurse doctor Capital Region patient use jump option . This pop-up questionnaire contains question medical social relevance jump line , degree urgency , reason encounter ( RFE ) probable diagnosis . The questionnaire short complete less minute . Furthermore , similar questionnaire ( without question relevance jump line ) pop-up triage professional random group patient intervention arm jump line random group patient belong control arm . This enable investigator compare three group . This method collect data GPs find feasible early study . A patient questionnaire send random group patient use jump option . Questions focus reason use jump option , patient satisfaction , effect intervention feeling safety , well relevant patient contact characteristic ( e.g . RFE ) . Furthermore , questionnaires sent random group patient intervention arm jump line . Questions group focus reason use jump option , RFE , patient satisfaction , effect intervention feeling safety . Finally , questionnaire send random group patient control group , focus RFE patient satisfaction current system . As part telephone message OOH-PC telephone , patient inform ongoing study option participate study . The questionnaire plan sent day contact ordinary letter well message patient 's electronic mailbox require state ( e-boks ) link electronic version questionnaire . If patient less 14 year old , questionnaire address parent . Patients receive one questionnaire study period although may several contact . Furthermore , investigator collect information contact OOH-PC Helpline 1813 study period electronic patient record system OOH-PC Helpline 1813 provide : CPR number patient , date time contact , triage outcome ( i.e . telephone consultation , consultation , home visit referral ED hospital department ) , use jump line option , wait time telephone line time patient call service . If patient choose jump line , investigator also collect length wait time time jump . Study period power calculation : Based patient questionnaire : The investigator want able detect minimum mean difference 0.3 jumper non-jumpers outcome measure regard satisfaction feeling safety . If investigator assume sample standard deviation 1 , significance level 5 % , power 95 % give mean 3 investigator need total 580 answered patient questionnaire able detect difference 0.3 two group . This mean , response rate patient 40 % , investigator send 1450 questionnaire . In 2013 total number contact OOH-PC Central Denmark Region approximately 660,000 . An early study show approximately 80 % patient type CPR number phone call service . Numbers Netherlands show user rate 3 % version option jump line . An estimated response rate GPs 70 % give study period approximately 1,6 month . Based number jump : In relation aim frequency jump line investigator want determine user rate . The investigator estimate user rate 3 % give 7,800 user intervention one year . In order obtain satisfactory power calculation usage jump option investigator want 95 % -confidence interval +/- 2,2 % . This mean investigator need least 1950 jumper , require 3 month complete study . In conclusion investigator need approximately 3 month complete study want satisfactory power regard frequency jump patient satisfaction . The investigator plan conduct pilot study run time 1-2 week give precise estimate user rate order perform accurate power calculation define length study period . Analyses : The investigator provide descriptive analysis group patient jump line , group choose jump line , patient control group , along univariate analysis compare patient three group ( i.e . patient characteristic , RFE , incentives ) . Descriptive analysis perform use Student 's t-test data follow normal distribution , Mann-Whitney U-test non-normally distribute data , chi-square test categorical data . For primary outcome measure patient satisfaction feel safety investigator perform intention treat analysis well analyse subgroup . The association relevant jump GP assess level urgency patient characteristic explore use multivariate binomial regression take cluster GP level account . The association patient ' choose jump line , satisfaction option , reason , assess use multivariate binomial regression model . Perspective : This study provide knowledge feasibility effect implement option jump telephone wait line OOH-PC Helpline 1813 , clarify whether patient use option appropriately . This information use decide whether intervention implement nationwide . The percentage patient potentially benefit option jump line expect relatively limited , total number contact OOH-PC extensive , absolute number patient actually benefit simple intervention likely substantial . Especially area feel safety investigator hope see significant effect . This intervention robust extend region setting easily . Information decrease wait time urgent case could lead stratification quality goal different patient group . Also high number case acute illness could handle OOH-PC could ease pressure 112-EMCC .</detailed_description>
