	<brief_title>Mastopexy With Autologous Augmentation Women After Massive Weight Loss - A Clinical , Randomized Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In Massive Weight Loss ( MWL ) patient breast often appear deflate following prominent volume decrease . The breast deflate , supportive fibrous tissue lax structural property change . In typical patient breast base sunk along inframammary crease shape breast wide flat significant ptosis . One way help woman offer mastopexy autologous augmentation . There several different surgical technique treat ptotic deflate breast MWL patient . In study investigator compare investigator technique , LOPOSAM , Rubins Mastopexy autologous augmentation . In Rubins Mastopexy , extensive re-arrangement skin , fat breast tissue do suppose give good long term result . The procedure however time consume extensive . The LOPOSAM technique less extensive therefore less time consume investigator hypothesis therefore technique low complication rate . Women refer mastopexy MWL meet criterion post bariatric surgery , set Danish National Board Health , find suitable candidate mastopexy autologous augmentation invite participate study . Sample size assessment show 22 woman ( 11 group ) need number patient expect recruited 6-9 month . The study design prospective randomize trial . Preoperative breast measurement clinical photograph compare measurement clinical photograph 3 , 6 12 month postoperative The primary outcome operation time secondary outcome include economics , breast measurement , cosmetic result complication rate . With trial , investigator hope demonstrate whether one two technique superior therefore preferred technique .</detailed_description>
