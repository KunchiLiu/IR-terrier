	<detailed_description>The acoustic neuromodulation trial ( ANM-T ) two-phase , single-site , pilot randomize clinical trial examine feasibility complete large scale efficacy study novel treatment non-linear modulate acoustic stimulus reduce anxiety severity youth anxiety disorder . Phase I involve randomize controlled trial compare active acoustic neuromodulation non-active acoustic stimulus ( Placebo PBO ) youth age 7-17 year least one follow primary DSM-5 diagnosis : separation anxiety disorder ( SAD ) , social anxiety disorder generalize anxiety disorder ( GAD ) . Additionally , study include ten healthy volunteer participant order study staff appropriately trained administer EEG . Furthermore , three pilot case complete start data collection ensure effective delivery study procedure maintenance blind acute study phase . Phase II 3-month treatment maintenance period Phase I responder . Phase I non-responders PBO offer active open treatment . Assessments include likely used large efficacy trial include parent child report , child self report , blind independent evaluator rating primary outcome . In addition , effort ass feasibility , monthly recruitment rate , number consent sign , subject randomize , rate adherence treatment protocol , safety intervention control condition , patient family acceptability treatment assessment protocol evaluate . Study Phases Entry Gates : 30 subject age 7-17 year enrol , use multiple gating procedure design ensure subject enrol evidence stable , pervasive anxiety diagnosis start treatment . - Gate A 20-minute semi-scripted telephone screen procedure elicit preliminary inclusion/exclusion information provide additional information caller . - Gate B screening assessment determine `` caseness '' . After complete informed consent participant parent complete standard questionnaire interview establish child meet inclusion exclusion criterion medically safe complete study ( clearance pediatrician pregnancy test menstruating female ) . This visit videotape last approximately 2.5 hour . -Gate C baseline assessment anxiety severity randomization visit take approximately 2.5 hour videotape . All subject recruit screen enrolled investigator Weill Cornell Medical College . Phase I : Phase I 6-week randomize ( 1:1 ) control comparison ANM PBO . Subjects come 20-minute treatment session approximately every day 2 week ( 5 day 2 week ) . At study treatment visit study coordinator collect brief interim history anxiety symptom adverse event prior treatment . Formal outcome assessment blind independent evaluator ( IE ) collect week 6 . Phase II : Phase II 17 week treatment maintenance phase ( week 7 24 ) . At stage , ALL PARTICIPANTS begin active treatment . Active responder phase 1 monitored durability treatment response . Non-responders active treatment give second chance elicit response . Non-responders control treatment full course active treatment . Control treatment responder give chance respond active treatment . At study visit coordinator collect interim history adverse event . Formal outcome assessment blind independent evaluator occur week 12 24</detailed_description>
