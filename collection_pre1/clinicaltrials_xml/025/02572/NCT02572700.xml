	<brief_title>Pain Mechanisms Ultrasonographic Disease Activity Psoriatic Arthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients psoriatic arthritis , initiate switch anti-rheumatic treatment ( conventional disease modify drug biologic drug ) routine care due active disease state , enrol observational study . The overall aim investigate pain mechanisms US psoriatic change elucidate factor - independently interaction - influence treatment response 4 month . Patients baseline visit follow visit 4 month . Examinations perform time point include : 1 . Assessment pain mechanisms clinical evaluation ( swollen/tender joint ratio , tender point ) pain questionnaire ( widespread pain index , PainDETECT ) . 2 . Ultrasonography joint entheses two trained assessor 3 . Clinical examination psoriatic manifestation 4 . Interview questionnaires regard lifestyle , co-morbidity , function , quality life impact psoriatic manifestation . 5 . X-ray hand foot 6 . Blood sample 7 . AMPS test ( assessment motor process skill ) perform interpret certified ergo therapist . Clinical well patient-reported observer-based outcome describe overall study population prognostic influence US- pain mechanism analyse . Subsequently , analyse repeat certain subgroup patient ( e.g. , conventional drug therapy vs. biologic drug intervention ) exploratory manner .</detailed_description>
