	<brief_title>A Phase I Study Evaluate Safety Immunogenicity PnuBioVax</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase I study assess safety immunogenicity PnuBioVax administer three occasion 28 day apart dose level 50 µg , 200 µg , 500 µg healthy adult subject . The study involve 8 visit total; screening period determine eligibility , 3 treatment period comprise overnight stay clinic ( day 1 , 29 57 ) 4 outpatient follow visit ( 7 day dose period one day 85 ) . Volunteers also request complete diary card day 1 day 85 . 36 Volunteers take part study randomly assign sequential dose group follow : - Cohort 1 : 3 dos 50 µg PnuBioVax placebo - Cohort 2 : 3 dos 200 µg PnuBioVax placebo - Cohort 3 : 3 dos 500 µg PnuBioVax placebo Within cohort , nine subject receive PnuBioVax three subject receive placebo . Each subject receive administration PnuBioVax placebo Days 1 , 29 57 . The low dose PnuBioVax evaluate first ( i.e . Cohort 1 ) . Dose escalation proceed subsequent cohort blind safety data ( adverse event , injection site reaction , concomitant medication , vital sign routine laboratory assessment ) day 8 12 subject precede cohort review Sponsor Principal Investigator find satisfactory . The Sponsor Principal Investigator also review safety data subsequent dose ensure repeat dose give rise safety issue . Subjects follow 7 day vaccination also telephone 14 21 day follow vaccination . Subjects also request record adverse event daily diary . Haematology , biochemistry vital sign measure follow visit ( except day 85 ) full safety follow complete 7 day third dose ( day 64 ) . Bloods draw evaluation immune response PnuBioVax , 28 day follow first , second third administration ( Days 29 , 57 85 ) . The blood draw day 85 also use exploratory analysis . The presence autoantibody assess screening ( baseline level ) , day 85 measurement anti nuclear antibody ( ANA ) level .</detailed_description>
