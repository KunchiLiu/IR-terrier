	<brief_summary>The investigator propose pragmatic comparative effectiveness trial evaluate several decolonization strategy patient Staphylococcus aureus infection , household contact , household environmental surface . The central hypothesis proposal integrate approach periodic personal household environmental hygiene reduce S. aureus transmission household subsequently decrease incidence skin soft tissue infection ( SSTI ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Staph Household Intervention Eradication ( SHINE )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients active recent S. aureus SSTI recruit St. Louis Children 's Hospital community pediatric practice affiliate investigator practice-based research network . All participant ( index patient household contact ) perform baseline S. aureus decolonization protocol 5 day consist enhanced hygiene measure , application mupirocin antibiotic ointment anterior naris twice daily , daily body wash chlorhexidine antiseptic . Following 5-day baseline decolonization regimen , household randomize one three intervention group : 1 ) Periodic personal decolonization perform household member , include chlorhexidine body wash twice weekly 3 month application intranasal mupirocin 5 consecutive day month 3 month ; 2 ) Household environmental hygiene , include target cleaning household surface launder bed linen , weekly 3 month ; 3 ) Integrated periodic personal decolonization household environmental hygiene 3 month . Households follow prospectively ( 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 month follow randomization ) measure prevalence S. aureus colonization participant , household environmental surface , pet dog cat document incidence recurrent SSTI . Molecular strain type perform recovered S. aureus isolates illuminate transmission dynamic effect decolonization measure genetic epidemiology . Lastly , investigator assess resistance prescribe topical antimicrobial baseline longitudinal sampling .</detailed_description>
