	<brief_title>Transtibial Amputee Balance Training : A Randomised Controlled Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lower limb amputation ( LLA ) result loss biological joint structure ankle knee , along associate musculature . This reduce joint mobility strength thus adversely affect amputee ' ability maintain balance . As result , individual LLA show fall often compare age-matched otherwise healthy individual . In addition , individual LLA also increase fear fall reduce social participation fear . Improving balance ability , reduce fall fear fall patient group effective balance training intervention would number socio-economic benefit . Such benefit may include limited reduced care cost , reduce burden healthcare service improve sense patient well-being . Therefore , main aim current randomise control trial ( RCT ) investigate whether take part game console based-balance intervention , improve experienced LLAs balance ability . The RCT also aim assess intervention affect amputee 's fall rate , fear fall quality life . After provide informed consent , unilateral low limb amputee randomly allocate one two group ; experimental group ( 12-week balance training intervention ) control group ( intervention ) . Amputees experimental group loan use game console duration home-based intervention . Balance ability , fall rate , fear fall quality life assess prior post intervention period well three month follow end intervention period . Falls rate also assess one year post intervention period . Results current study provide evidence use games-console base balance intervention improve balance fall outcomes LLA .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>Unilateral transtibial amputee fit research design must least 12 month experience use prosthetic limb independently follow discharge inpatient treatment Minimum 18 year old . There gender requirement − Age requirement order selfconsent participate , thus child protection issue . Able travel − Data collection take place University campus participant attend data collection session . Able use prosthesis without pain discomfort minimum two hour time − Must able use prosthesis order complete task require research . Able stand period 2 minute , unaided without walk aid complete task require assessment participant require stand force platform perform volitional postural movement . Current musculoskeletal injury − Risk injury could increase . Unable follow instruction cognitive deficit − Risk injury whilst complete task incorrectly . Bilateral amputation − In order homogenous group amputees term categorisation amputation . Unable perform task due current medical condition e.g . rheumatoid arthritis − Risk worsen current condition and/or cause injury . Experience pain discomfort whilst wear prosthesis Risk injury and/or worsen current condition . To assessed clinical team individual inform study . Does use prosthesis regularly . Not able understand write verbal English − All communication English University service available able cope translation demand . Currently take medication know affect balance adversely Risk fall balance training and/or data collection session . Current Training Participants must currently use Nintendo Wii similar system structure balance training program . Inability provide inform consent Substantial change physical condition lower limb If consent participate study , individual refer mobility service due degradation physical condition either low limb , exclude study .</criteria>
