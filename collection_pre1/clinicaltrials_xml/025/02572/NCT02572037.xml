	<brief_title>Research Clinical Value New Classification Premature Ejaculation : Multi-Center Research</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Premature ejaculation ( PE ) one common male sexual dysfunction negative impact people 's quality life . According time PE syndromes come , PE clinically divide primary PE , appear first sex , secondary PE , occur period normal ejaculation . This method classification make little sense treatment . In 2008 , PE divide four type : primary PE , secondary PE , natural variable PE premature-like ejaculatory dysfunction , different type premature ejaculation correspond treatment . Both method classification base subjective feeling patient , whether certain objective test use help diagnose premature ejaculation ? The drug treatment PE mainly include local anesthetic selective 5- serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) , selective penile dorsal nerve block use surgery . But efficacy dapoxetine ( new SSRI PE ) local anesthetic 60-70 % 60 % , respectively , efficacy surgery exact without standard surgical indication . We suppose may different subtypes nerve patient premature ejaculation may exist , corresponds specific treatment . In previous study , investigator study somatic sensory pathway autonomic nerve function patient premature ejaculation , find characterize different neural electrophysiological characteristic . About 60 % patient primary PE show hypersensitivity penis , efficacy local anesthetic selective penile dorsal nerve block reach 90 % . While SSRI reduce excitability sympathetic nervous system patient PE , effect drug patient Sympathetic hyperexcitability well without Sympathetic hyperexcitability . Thus doctor already divide patient suffer PE ( disease mention exclusion criterion ) 4 group accord result nerve electrophysiological examination give corresponding treatment : 1 . Penile sensory hyperexcitability Group , use local anaesthetic ( compound lidocaine cream ) treat ; 2 . Sympathetic hyperexcitability Group : use selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) ( Dapoxetine ) treat . 3 . Mixed type Group : Penile sensory hyperexcitability Sympathetic hyperexcitability : Combined use two treatment . 4 . Other Group : result nerve electrophysiological examination normal : group patient receive examination figure reason . This pattern treatment use clinical practice year . In research , investigator systemically observe result classification treatment 12 week . Patients ask participate research . The questionnaire ( IELT , PEDT , PEP ) fill visited online every 4 week . If refuse , would still receive classified treatment enrol research . After treatment 12 week , investigator measure change IELT , PEDT , PEP , nerve electrophysiological examination CGIC , compare efficacy treatment report . If anyone want continue treatment , could quit research . Software SPSS17.0 use data analysis . The age , height , weight , quantity table , latency amplitude group express mean add subtract standard deviation . Quantitative data comparison among group analyze single factor variance analysis ( one-way ANOVA LSD ) , comparison rate use x2 test , comparison treatment compare paired test . P &lt; 0.05 show statistically significant difference .</detailed_description>
