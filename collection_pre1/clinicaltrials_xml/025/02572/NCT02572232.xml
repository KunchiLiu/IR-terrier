	<brief_title>Supraglottic Airway Devices Pediatric Difficult Airway Situations</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Supraglottic airway device ( SAD ) design `` intubate , ventilate '' scenario prehospital well intrahospital setting utilized medical emergency service emergency department world , anticipate unanticipated difficult airway situation also airway device use non-anesthesiologists situation limit practice possible . Securing airway pediatric emergency situation crucial . Unfortunately , pediatrician usually lack required skill regular practice perform endotracheal intubation ( ETI , gold standard secure airway ) quickly safely . SADs would pose safe feasible alternative ETI . However , study topic available . The investigator therefore want evaluate three different SADs ( Combitube , Easytube , laryngeal mask airway ) simulate difficult airway situation pediatric manikin comparison ETI .</detailed_description>
