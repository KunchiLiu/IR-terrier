	<brief_summary>Designed single arm multi-center prospective phase II trial , evaluate number dissect lymph node N2-area surrogate parameter adequate D2 lymphadenectomy robotic distal gastrectomy ( RDG ) clinical stage II III gastric cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Assessment Robotic Distal Gastrectomy Non-inferiority N2 Area Nodal Dissection</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The number retrieve LNs N2 area RDG go calculate accord pathology report comparative analysis historic group undergone open surgery clinical stage II III gastric cancer NCC Korea last year . METHODS AGAINST BIAS Minimizing selection bias : After initiation study , patient screen consecutively eligible patient ask enrol trial . The trial design prospective multi-center phase II trial . Patients go allocated RAG give signed consent sufficient consideration time . Minimizing performance bias : The study plan prospective single arm multi-center trial , retrospective data suggest disadvantage lymph node retrieval RAG compare LAG . Surgery go perform accord guideline Japanese Research Society Study Gastric Cancer ( 3rd edition ) . Japanese randomize controlled trial proven effectiveness adequate D2 lymphadenectomy several randomize controlled trial . As number dissect lymph node surrogate marker adequate lymph node dissection , patient least 25 lymph node remove ( obtained pathology report ) definitively include data assessment . Further lymph node station No . # 7 , # 8a , # 9 , # 11p , # 12a subtotal gastrectomy accord Japanese Guideline dissect surgical specimen analyze separately pathologic workup . All patient trial go analyze , success rate LN dissection N2-area primary endpoint . Surgery trial must perform board certify surgeon take part trial specific training course . Potential learn curve artefact negligible RAG go performed surgeon highly train experienced robotic gastrectomy . Participating surgeon experience operator 50 case open gastrectomy , 50 laparoscopic gastrectomy , 15 case robotic gastrectomy . Furthermore , surgical quality enforce intraoperative video documentation . Also , picture nodal dissection area resection submit quality assurance . Minimizing detection bias : Patients go regularly undergo standardized follow-up visit 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 , 30 , 36 , 48 , 60 month evaluate disease status abdominopelvic CT. EGD do 3 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 60 month .</detailed_description>
