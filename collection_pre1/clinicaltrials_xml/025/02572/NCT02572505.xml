	<detailed_description>Human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) infection become treatable disease many infected individual interested family . Couples man infect woman HIV-negative ( hereafter refer HIV-discordant ) require medical intervention procreation prevent HIV transmission female child . The current view reduce number infection involve unprotected intercourse HIV-discordant couple public health issue U.S . The risk HIV transmission regular intercourse HIV-discordant couple stable relationship 1 case every 1000 sexual act . However , risk extremely low 1 ) couple monogamous ; 2 ) intravenous ( IV ) drug use ; 3 ) man low HIV viral load , high CD4 count ( CD4 cell white blood cell attack HIV ) , symptoms disease ; 4 ) couple free sexually transmitted infection ; 5 ) male female genital tract free sore ; 6 ) man circumcise ; 7 ) man take antiretroviral treatment ( ART ) . In fact , study African HIV-discordant couple find transmission HIV patient either low blood level HIV , symptom HIV infection take ART . The safe method HIV-discordant couple insemination use sperm donor , adoption remain childless . However , couple strongly desire biologically relate child . Fertility clinic U.S. resistant treat HIV-discordant couple . Generally , available treatment U.S. involve vitro fertilization ( IVF ) , involve collect sperm eggs couple allow fertilization occur laboratory , intracytoplasmic sperm injection ( ICSI ) , single sperm inject directly egg . One cycle treatment cost 20 % median annual income U.S. , birth rate method approximately 35 % per cycle treatment . These factor significantly reduce access care , study show access care low , many couple choose use unprotected intercourse , even counsel risk involve . Without appropriate screening counseling , unprotected intercourse risky , 4 % woman become infect one study Pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) treatment take woman unprotected intercourse infect man . The U.S. Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve drug Truvada ( Tenofovir/emtricitabine ) use HIV-discordant couple . Whereas IVF ICSI invasive technique breach natural barrier infection female reproductive tract , intercourse preserve protective mechanism . The goal treat HIV-discordant couple reduce infectivity male susceptibility female infection . Trials carry primarily Africa look HIV transmission HIV-discordant couple show use PrEP significantly reduce risk transmission . Based result , U.S. Centers Disease Control prevention ( CDC ) recommend serodiscordant patient wish child counsel availability PrEP . When risk transmission minimize , include undetectable HIV blood use PrEP , unprotected intercourse fertile period likely safe option conceive child . An ongoing Swiss trial , start 2004 , infection female 53 couple , overall pregnancy rate 75 % 6 cycle treatment . Preliminary data United Kingdom trial report 13 couple 11 pregnancy female infection . An Italian trial initiate recently . Treatment HIV-discordant couple PrEP time , unprotected intercourse remain experimental . The investigator propose enroll HIV-discordant couple counsel safe alternative donor insemination , adoption remain childless ; offer referral clinic offering sperm wash insemination ICSI ; apprise risk use PrEP one time intercourse per cycle ; decide proceed method . Couples population HIV-discordant patient minimal risk disease transmission describe . After evaluation normal fertility low potential disease transmission , couple receive instruction time fertile day cycle , woman give prescription PrEP medication . The woman offspring follow 6 month use blood test check evidence HIV infection .</detailed_description>
