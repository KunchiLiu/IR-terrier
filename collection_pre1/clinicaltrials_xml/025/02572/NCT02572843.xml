	<brief_summary>The objective trial demonstrate addition neoadjuvant adjuvant immunotherapy ( anti-PD-L1 antibody MEDI4736 ) standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy ( cisplatin/docetaxel ) primary resectable stage IIIA ( N2 ) NSCLC efficacious feasible .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Despite multimodal therapy , cure rate patient stage IIIA NSCLC poor therapy outcome fail improve past year . The addition immunotherapy anti-PD-L1 antibody MEDI4736 novel treatment modality potential improve outcome without add substantial toxicity otherwise intensive multimodality treatment , MEDI4736 generally well tolerate . Based current evidence immune checkpoint inhibition , strong rationale test novel treatment modality also curative set order improve local tumor control prevent distant metastasis improve cure rate patient population . The trial investigate addition pre- post-operative immune checkpoint inhibition MEDI4736 previously establish standard care stage IIIA ( N2 ) patient , base trial SAKK16/96 SAKK16/00 . Patients whose tumor deem resectable diagnosis receive 3 cycle ( 21 day ) standard chemotherapy cisplatin ( 100 mg/m2 ) / docetaxel ( 85 mg/m2 ) , follow 2 cycle ( 14 day ) neoadjuvant immunotherapy MEDI4736 750 mg . Following surgery , patient complete resection ( R0 ) tumor administer adjuvant treatment MEDI4736 750 mg one year recurrence , death , unacceptable toxicity consent withdrawal ( whichever occurs first ) . Patients incomplete R1/R2 resection , include patient extracapsular spread mediastinal lymph node metastasis , may undergo standard radiotherapy prior adjuvant treatment MEDI4736 .</detailed_description>
