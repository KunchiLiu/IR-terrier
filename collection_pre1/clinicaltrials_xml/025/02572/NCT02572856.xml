	<detailed_description>During surgery high blood glucose level , term hyperglycemia , commonly encounter due physiological stress . Hyperglycemia associate complication surgical site infection , adverse cardiovascular pulmonary event . Optimal glucose control target prevent hyperglycemia show reduce risk complication . However , perform optimal glycemic management surgery significant challenge vary effect surgical stress anesthesia intervention produce rapid change glucose level . The current method manually measure blood glucose every hour le grossly inadequate track change glucose level . Continuous Glucose Monitors ( CGMs ) ability automatically measure blood glucose level near continuous fashion . Integrating CGMs part glycemic control protocol lead well management glucose level few hyperglycemia episode low glucose level variability result good post-surgical outcome . The viability use CGM surgery minimally study , old generation system . The investigator propose study aim evaluate viability use current generation CGM surgery patient . The primary goal study evaluate feasibility accuracy Continuous Glucose Monitor ( CGM ) measure blood glucose level trend surgery patient . The secondary goal observe analyze trend perioperative blood glucose level understand dynamic effect surgical stress anesthetic agent blood glucose level . This information allow development well intraoperative glucose management strategy protocols . The specific aim study outline : 1 . Compare glucose measurement make next generation , investigational Continuous Glucose Monitor ( Dexcom Gen 4 Professional CGM ) point care ( POC ) glucose meter ( Accu Chek Inform II , Roche Diagnostics ) , intraoperative postoperative period . 2 . Correlate trend glucose level measure CGM surgery anesthesia event ( Induction , Incision , Emergence ) factor , administration anesthetic drug ( inhalational agent , steroid , etc ) The study protocol describe : CGM : Dexcom Gen 4 Professional CGM use propose study . The Gen 4 CGM FDA approve non-hospital use . Its use study off-label use hospital set . However , study CGM use secondary monitor intend patient care . The anesthesia provider nurse practitioner continue use exist manual glucose measurement ( Point care glucose meter laboratory measurement ) clinical care . The measurement make Dexcom Gen 4 CGM blind ( display ) provider patient see use measure value . The sensor place upper arm . Sensor location consistent across patient . Because CGM make interstitial glucose measurement , interference IV infusion anticipate minimal . However , minimize potential interaction infusion ( Dextrose ) placement sensor arm different IV arm , possible . A plastic cup ( one use protect eye ) place sensor protect . The total life Gen 4 sensor 7 day . For CGM , accuracy great sensor place 2 day . For reason , investigator would target place CGM sensor 2 day prior surgery continuous glucose monitoring accurately perform maximum 5 day care . After placement , CGM sensor require warm-up period 2 hour measurement make . Once warm-up complete , CGM require initial calibration . To ensure reliability , first calibration perform patient hospital . If calibration fails , patient exclude study rather place new sensor wait another 2 hour calibration . Subsequent calibration patient away hospital perform patient . Once patient arrives surgery , calibration perform preoperative hold area prior surgery research coordinator . The subsequent recalibrations postoperative phase also perform research coordinator . Study protocol : The study conduct single phase University Washington Medical Center . However , first 4 patient , safety evaluation perform . Study continue CGM determine safe able make glucose measurement comparable make standard point care ( POC ) glucose meter . Screening Consenting : Potential patient identify surgeon 's clinic assistance PCC ( Patient care coordinator ) notify research coordinator . The research coordinator screen patient make sure he/she meet eligibility criterion . If patient meet eligibility criterion , research coordinator approach candidate patient History &amp; Physical visit communicate study detail provide consent form . If candidate patient express interest , research coordinator arrange Pre-anesthesia clinic visit 2 day prior day surgery . Research coordinator contact ( phone/email ) candidate patient prior surgery answer study related question enquire patient 's decision participate study . If candidate patient wish participate , coordinator make arrangement obtain signed consent enroll patient study . Research coordinator meet candidate patient prior Pre-anesthesia clinic visit collect sign consent form , thus officially enrol patient study . The patient give gift card token appreciation enrol study . Placement CGM sensor calibration : The CGM sensor warm-up period 2 hour measurement make . Specifically , 2 hour warm-up CGM monitor prompt 2 calibration blood glucose value . Once calibration complete , CGM ready measure glucose value though best accuracy achieve 48 hour . CGM sensor apply consented patient begin Pre-anesthesia clinic visit . The sensor calibrate end Pre-anesthesia clinic visit normally 2 hour would elapse . Two independent finger stick glucose measurement make AccuCheck Inform II glucose meter ( one use operating room ) use calibrate sensor . In event calibration fail , patient undergo early withdrawal study . For patient calibration successful instruction give recalibrate system remainder wear . Further , CGM monitor configure display glucose measurement trend ( blinded mode ) . Lastly , CGM clock synchronize hospital computer clock . Subsequent Pre-anesthesia clinic visit , patient carry glucose monitor sensor home . The patient calibrate sensor finger stick measurement use home glucose meter . The study coordinator contact enrol patient everyday till surgery remind confirm CGM sensor calibrate per instruction . In addition , research coordinator call patient even prior surgery remind him/her bring CGM monitor next day surgery . Day surgery , prior surgery : On day surgery candidate patient admit preoperative hold area . The research coordinator make sure CGM place correctly calibrate sensor use hospital POC glucose meter measurement . The preoperative hold area nurse advise place IV arm one CGM sensor place . During surgery : The institutional protocol glucose management follow use POC lab glucose measurement reference . The measurement make CGM blind anesthesia provider able see use CGM value clinical care . In OR , CGM monitor place top platform anesthesia machine beside POC glucose meter base . This location ensure monitor within 20 foot sensor within control anesthesia provider . Hourly blood glucose measurement perform POC glucose meter ( Roche Diagnostics Inform II ) laboratory meter ( part arterial blood gas panel ) automatically acquire document electronic anesthesia record . The CGM keep log continuous glucose measurement every 5 minute retrospective download review . The anesthesia information system also document patient demographic ( Age , Gender , BMI , etc ) , medication fluid , anesthetic agent 's concentration , temperature , surgical anesthesia event . These data element retrospectively download analysis . After surgery ( PACU/ICU/Wards ) : The institutional protocol glucose management continue surgery PACU , surgical ICU surgical ward . Glucose continue monitor every 1-6 hour . In addition POC measurement , blood sample take venous arterial collection automatically document inpatient electronic medical record . The CGM measurement continue blind nurse practitioner . The CGM recalibrated specified interval postoperative use . CGM use continue total period 5 day surgery patient discharge hospital whichever occur early . CGM monitor disconnect &amp; cleaning : The CGM sensor monitor remove end study period either research coordinator bedside nurse . The CGM cover protective shield clean per procedure approve CGM . After clean procedure complete monitor use new patient . Additionally , CGM measurement download principal investigator data file later analysis . Safety feasibility check : A safety feasibility check perform CGM apply 4 patient . The primary outcome measure safety check point ability sensor make measurement transmit result monitor without data drop ( without significant interruption electrocautery surgical intervention , anesthetic intervention medication administration ) . Additionally , feasibility applying , maintain use sensor OR environment evaluate potential issue . Lastly , study also observe unexpected incidence patient safety issue - potential infection , rash , swell area sensor apply , potential RF interference etc . The study continue successful completion safety check , reasonable assurance CGM use safely reliably operate room postoperative area acceptable accuracy ( Mean Absolute Relative Difference ~ 20 % ) without significant interference anesthetic drug , electrocautery , edema surgery anesthesia factor . Data extraction analysis : The CGM glucose measurement make every 5 minute download monitor computer file use software program provide Dexcom Inc . Patient demographic ( Age , Gender , BMI , DM status ) , preoperative lab ( glucose , HbA1c ) , anesthesia surgery event , POC glucose measurement , medication data ( include insulin ) , temperature anesthetic agent information extract Anesthesia Information Management System ( AIMS ) database . Post-operative glucose measurement medication information collect Hospital Electronic Medical Record Data warehouse system ( AMALGA , Microsoft Inc. Redmond , WA ) . Data analysis focus three aspect : 1 . Test equivalence : Paired CGM-POC measurement compare determine mean bias ( mean difference ) SD . The investigator report 95 % limit agreement , calculate mean bias ± 1.96 X SD , recommend statistic assess agreement two method measurement . Data present Bland-Altman plot . 2 . CGM accuracy bias : The CGM measurement compare correspond POC glucose measurement evaluate accuracy . MARD ( Mean Absolute Relative Difference ) use main accuracy measure . Effect confound factor - body temperature , BMI , Diabetes status , inotrope score , anesthetic agent , medication use electrocautery CGM functionality measurement accuracy evaluate . CGM accuracy assessment perform via follow step : - Pearson correlation coefficient CGM POC glucose pair value - Clarke Error Grid analysis relate CGM-POC glucose measurement pair evaluate clinical accuracy ( % measurement zone A &amp; B ) - MARD range pair CGM-POC glucose measurement follow glucose range &lt; 100 , 100-140 , 140-180 , &gt; 180 mg/dL 3 . Trends change blood glucose level : Trends change blood glucose level course surgery immediate postoperative phase ( 24 hour ) analyze across patient determine consistent trend indicator ( anesthesia surgery event , use medication , anesthetic agent etc ) . Specifically , multivariate analysis glucose trend adjust covariates conduct determine effect surgical stress , anesthesia medication blood glucose level .
