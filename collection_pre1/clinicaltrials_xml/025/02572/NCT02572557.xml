	<brief_summary>Rationale : Spray cryotherapy ( SCT ) use liquid nitrogen safely effectively use esophagus , airways pleura . Treatment SCT central airway stenosis may provide effective , durable perhaps safer alternative current therapeutic modality . Objectives : 1 . To investigate feasibility use Spray cryotherapy ( SCT ) treatment malignant benign central airway disease . 2 . To investigate safety use Spray cryotherapy ( SCT ) treatment malignant benign central airway disease . 3 . To investigate efficacy use Spray cryotherapy ( SCT ) treatment malignant benign central airway disease . Study design : This study prospective , single arm , open label intervention study perform University Medical Center Groningen , The Netherlands Study population : The study population exist 25 patient malignant benign central airway disease . Patients current treatment option regard suboptimal include study . Intervention : TruFreeze Spray CryoTherapy Main study parameter : Feasibility define able apply SCT plan one , bronchoscopies accord instruction use ( IFU ) . Secondary study parameter : Safety assess capture adverse event ( AEs ) occur 1 ) SCT procedure , 2 ) AEs occur hospital discharge . Efficacy measure use 1 ) patient report outcome ( questionnaire ) , 2 ) percentage improvement airway stenosis , 3 ) durability treatment effect , 4 ) need re-intervene therapy treatment failure . Nature extent burden , risk benefit associated participation . Patients recruit participate prospective clinical trial severe central airway disease highly symptomatic current available therapy either difficult perform , hazardous , real benefit , simply available yet . The current treatment risk patient group high , especially patient airway patency risk . The main additional risk associate use SCT occurrence pneumothorax . Patients participate adhere current medical care , one addition voluntary follow-up bronchoscopy SCT .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criterium : 1 . Presence malignant benign central airway disease current treatment option regard suboptimal . 1 . Patient inability tolerate bronchoscopy general anaesthesia . 2 . Compromised tissue ( significant ulceration mucosal break ablation area , procedure preexist condition significantly reduce tissue strength significantly reduce elasticity ablation area ) . 3 . Airway diameter cause anatomical flow resistance inhibit N2 gas evacuation ( Endotracheal tube equivalent &lt; 8.5mm exclude ) .</criteria>
