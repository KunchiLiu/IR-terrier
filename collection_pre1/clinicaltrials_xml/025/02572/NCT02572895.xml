According recent study , quantification PACs require standardize reproducible method least 37 mg/day . It hypothesize efficacy cranberry extract UTIs prevention among young woman strongly increase use optimal dosage ( standardized 37 mg/day PACs ) . The purpose clinical trial study ass , among young sexually active woman present recurrent UTIs , efficacy optimal dose cranberry extract quantify standardized 37 mg/day PACs , compare control dose quantify standardized 2 mg/day PACs mean number new UTIs 6-month follow-up period .</detailed_description>
