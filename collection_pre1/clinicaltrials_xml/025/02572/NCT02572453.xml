	<brief_title>AT13387 Treating Patients With Relapsed Refractory Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma , Mantle Cell Lymphoma , Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . Overall response rate ( ORR ) single agent AT13387 ( onalespib ) measure proportion partial complete response ( PR + CR ) patient relapsed/refractory anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) positive ( + ) anaplastic large cell lymphoma ( ALCL ) , mantle cell lymphoma ( MCL ) , B-cell lymphoma 6 protein positive ( BCL6+ ) diffuse large B cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Progression free survival ( PFS ) overall survival ( OS ) , well duration response ( DOR ) single agent AT13387 ( onalespib ) patient ALK+ ALCL , MCL , BCL6+ DLBCL . II . Safety tolerability single agent AT13387 ( onalespib ) patient ALK+ ALCL , MCL , BCL6+ DLBCL . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . Measurement on-target activity AT13387 ( onalespib ) ALK+ ALCL , MCL , BCL6+ DLBCL immunoblotting immunohistochemistry pre-treatment , on-treatment , time progression tumor biopsy HSP90 client . II . Determination genetic transcriptional marker response resistance AT13387 ( onalespib ) patient ALK+ ALCL , MCL , BCL6+ DLBCL . OUTLINE : Patients receive onalespib intravenously ( IV ) 1 hour day 1 , 2 , 8 , 9 , 15 16 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 6 month 1 year .</detailed_description>
