	<brief_summary>This study aim towards investigate efficacy near-infrared spectroscopy ( NIRS ) -based neurofeedback training virtual reality ( VR ) classroom schoolchildren attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) . The investigator especially interested training 's impact academic performance , executive functioning ( EF ) behavioral ADHD symptom . Furthermore , investigator aim examine influence teacher ' instructional behavior child ADHD 's learn short virtual reality classroom scenario . Several study provide evidence poor academic achievement ADHD mainly due impairment EF ADHD behavior ( e.g. , Frazier , Youngstrom , Glutting , &amp; Watkins , 2007 ; Miller et al. , 2013 ) . Furthermore , study show factor related neurophysiological characteristic find electroencephalographic ( EEG ) functional NIRS ( fNIRS ) examination ( e.g. , Barry , Clarke , &amp; Johnstone , 2003 ; Barry , Johnstone , &amp; Clarke , 2003 ; Loo &amp; Barkley , 2005 ; Negoro et al. , 2010 ) . Neurofeedback training aim improve neurophysiological well cognitive-behavioral deficit ( Gevensleben , Moll , Rothenberger , &amp; Heinrich , 2014 ) , expect improve academic performance child ADHD accordingly . Training VR classroom , investigator ' perspective , facilitate generalization self-regulation competence real-life academic situation time increase effort invest training compare train 2D setting . Consequently , train VR classroom hypothesize lead great improvement academic performance , EF great decrease ADHD symptoms train 2D setting . Moreover , investigator hypothesize effect pronounce child receive NIRS-based neurofeedback training compare child receive biofeedback training base electromyogram ( EMG ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>1 . Strategies 90 schoolchildren Grade 1 4 meet criterion DSM-V diagnosis ADHD ( presentation ) recruit . The design involve three group ( n = 30 per group ; N = 90 ) recruit child assign randomly , match age , gender , medication . In addition VR NIRS NF VR EMG biofeedback group , third group experience NIRS NF exact 2D classroom environment . 2 . The Study 2.1 . Testing Protocol Informed consent discussion : Parents child pre-diagnosed ADHD undergo screen process . However , parent whose child pre-diagnosed ADHD , provided German version Conners-3 parent ADHD-Index ( C3-AI ) . Only screen indicate child increase risk ADHD , investigator proceed inform consent discussion . If screening indicate unlikely child ADHD , investigator exclude child study . After meeting , child either pre-diagnosed ADHD , screen indicates increase likelihood child ADHD , parent enough time think whether want give write informed consent participate study . If parent give write informed consent , next step session ADHD diagnosis verify . For session , parent inform three opportunity . 1 . Diagnostic session scope participation second study pediatric clinic Tübingen time participate biofeedback study . This study call `` Aufmerksamkeit und Kognition bei Kindern mit Neurofibromatose Typ 1 '' , still search child ADHD ( without neurofibromatosis type 1 ) form control group . 2 . Diagnostic session scope `` Spezialsprechstunde ADHS '' outpatient clinic department child adolescence psychiatry . 3 . Diagnostic session within scope biofeedback study describe . Diagnostic session : For standardized confirmation well characterization diagnosis , long version Conners-3 parent teacher rating scale ( 3-P 3-T ) apply . Furthermore , German version Strengths- Difficulties Questionnaire ( SDQ-Deu ) go assess severity symptom well comorbidities class teacher well parental perspective . In order ass actual quality life parent child parent child ask fill Kiddy-Kindl appropriate version . Moreover , surround variable medication , prior treatment , clinical diagnosis etc . assess questionnaire . As neuropsychological variable , intelligence assess use short version Culture Fair Test ( CFT 1-R CFT 20-R ) . Pre-Test : Session 1 pre-test go assess executive function participant require washout methylphenidate ( MPH ) well amphetamine . MPH amphetamine wash least 48 hour weekend pre-test take place Mondays . Atomoxetine need washout effect medication directly relate drug level blood . In first session , combine EEG/NIRS-measurement take place investigator would like provide information whether change cause BF intervention also reflect change measure EEG NIRS follow task : Go/No-Go Task ( 10 min . ) , verbal fluency task ( 10 min . ) n-back task ( 10 min. ) . Furthermore , participant ' performance digit span task ( forward &amp; backward ) ( 10 min . ) ass verbal WM whereas matrix span task ( 15 min . ) Corsi Block Tapping Task ( forward &amp; backward ) ( 10 min . ) ass visual-spatial WM performance . Inhibition assess use Stop Signal Task ( 10 min. ) . Session 2 ( without medication washout ) ass academic performance use one appropriate DEMAT 1+-4 ( 20-40 Min . ) assess mathematical performance SLRT-II ( 25-35 Min . ) assess read write performance . Furthermore , sustain attention assess Conner 's CPT ( 15 min. ) . Questionnaires assess self-control academic self-efficacy fill child ( ca . 20 min. ) . Furthermore , accelerometer worn non-dominant side body ( hip ) , attached waistband light belt , ten consecutive day objectively assess motor hyperactivity . During time , parent call per day ass ADHD symptom Global Index ADHD ( ADHS-GI ) check whether accelerometer worn work . Parents teacher ask fill BRIEF well SDQ-Deu , long version Conners-3 parent teacher rating scale ( 3-P 3-T ) Kiddy-Kindl . Moreover , investigator ask parent fill adapt version FERT well adapt version brief self-control scale order ass expectancy train . Midway-Test : After eight session , participant break two three week NF BF training take place . ADHD behavior assess ask parent well teacher fill Conners 3-P/ 3-T. Post-Test : The post-test follow procedure already apply pre-test . Follow-Up-Test ( 6 month last training session ) : The Follow-Up-Test follow course post-test exactly . Every session . During every session , investigator assess participant 's motivation short questionnaire measure joy , effort enthusiasm . Furthermore , heart rate variability ( HRV ) record show related motivational process . Accelerometer data knee wrist record examine hyperactive behavior . 2.2 . Training Plan Protocol The NIRS- EMG-based NF BF training protocol study include 15 training session total , two three per week . Every training session last 60 minute include biofeedback training preparation phase beginning , NIRS cap optodes fit head case NF training , EMG electrodes place Musculi supraspinatus case BF training . Furthermore , head-mounted display ( HMD ) VR mount ( VR 3D classroom group ) . Every training session NIRS- EMG-based NF/BF consist three run , first second continuous performance feedback ( feedback condition ) . In third run , feedback provide ( transfer condition ) . Lighting 3D VR 2D classroom increase activation decrease deactivation . During first eight training session , train follow protocol 50 % activation 50 % deactivation trial . For second half training session , protocol change 80 % activation 20 % deactivation trial . After eight session , participant two three week break aim support transfer real-life set use stimulus card screenshots train set instruction practice activation deactivation home daily basis . The stimulus card show image classroom participant see train introduce laboratory set directly train session 6 , 7 8 . That mean , help card look , participant practice brain muscular activation several time ( depend whether belong NIRS-NF EMG-BF group ) like learn training , i.e . imagine increase lighting room look stimulus card two four minute . After activation task , solve mathematical task riddle match age knowledge . In second half training session , break , participant ask continue practice activation home homework well situation require attention . 2.3 . Experimental Paradigm Participants receive NIRS-based NF training increase BOLD signal ( activation ) decrease accordingly ( deactivation ) . Analogously , participant BF train condition increase decrease muscular activity measure EMG . Every session consist three run . In first second run , contingent performance feedback provide , feedback give third run . Feedback provide participant via continuous change light within room ; room brighten increase activation dim increase deactivation . Additional feedback animate teacher well scoreboard provide positive reinforcement end every trial . Visual , auditory mixed distractors , instance , paper plane fly room , fellow student whisper , people knock door come room , introduce every run fourth training session onwards . The distractors appear distance least 60 second two distractors . The baseline first , second third run calculate BOLD signal last two second trigger ( arrow ) appear . Reinforcement provide 1 smiley participant spend 60 % time second half trial require side baseline ( i.e. , , deactivation require , , activation require ) . Analogously he/ receive 2 smiley 70 % 3 smiley 80 % second half trial require direction . Reinforcement second run change adaptively performance first run . If participant score 40-60 % success rate ( get least 1 smiley ) , second block remain exactly like first . If participant score low 40 % success rate , threshold decrease 0.8 standard deviation ( STD ) either direction relative baseline , normalization light make sensitive performance . In addition , threshold get smiley would decrease 50 % , 60 % , 70 % one , two three smiley respectively . If participant score high 60 % success rate first run , threshold would increase 1.2 STD baseline . In addition , percent time spend baseline baseline would need 0.1 STD baseline count towards overall percentage . The third run second calculation .</detailed_description>
