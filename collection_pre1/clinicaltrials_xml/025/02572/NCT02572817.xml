	<brief_title>Comparing Efficacy Safety High-Titer Versus Low-Titer Anti-Influenza Immune Plasma Treatment Severe Influenza A</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Despite antiviral vaccine , influenza responsible thousand hospitalization death year worldwide . Because , additional treatment influenza need . One potential treatment may use high-titer anti-influenza immune plasma . The purpose study evaluate efficacy safety treatment high-titer versus low-titer anti-influenza immune plasma , addition standard care , participant hospitalize severe influenza A infection . This study enroll people age 2 week old hospitalize severe influenza A infection . Participants randomly assign receive either high-titer anti-influenza plasma low-titer ( control ) anti-influenza plasma Day 0 . In addition , participant receive standard care antiviral . Participants assess Day 0 ( baseline ) Days 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 14 , 28 . For participant hospitalize Days 2 , 14 , 28 , researcher may contact participant telephone . Study procedure include clinical assessment , blood collection , oropharyngeal swab .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Inclusion Criteria Enrollment ( Screening ) : Subjects must age 2 week old . Hospitalization due sign symptom influenza ( decision hospitalization individual treating clinician ) . Study plasma available onsite available within 24 hour randomization . Not previously screen randomize study . Inclusion Criteria Randomization : Locally determine positive test influenza A ( polymerase chain reaction [ PCR ] , nucleic acid testing , rapid Ag ) specimen obtain less equal 48 hour prior randomization . Onset illness le equal 6 day randomization , define subject first experience least one respiratory symptom fever . Hospitalized due influenza , anticipate hospitalization 24 hour randomization . Criteria hospitalization individual treat clinician . Willingness blood respiratory sample obtain store . Willingness return require study visit participate study follow . National Early Warning ( NEW ) score great equal 3 within 12 hour prior randomization ( PEW [ pediatric early warning ] score great equal 3 within 12 hour prior randomization ) . ABOcompatible plasma available onsite available within 24 hour randomization . Exclusion Criteria Randomization : Strong clinical evidence judgment site investigator etiology illness primarily bacterial superinfection origin . Coinfection would allow , may benefit resolve influenza illness faster . Superinfection , influenza illness occur resolving , new bacterial illness cause deterioration exclude . Prior treatment antiinfluenza investigational drug , intravenous immune globulin ( IVIG ) , plasma therapy within 30 day prior screen . Other investigational drug therapy ( noninfluenza ) allow . History allergic reaction blood plasma product ( judge site investigator ) . A preexist condition use medication , opinion site investigator , may place individual substantially increase risk thrombosis ( e.g. , cryoglobulinemia , severe refractory hypertriglyceridemia , clinically significant monoclonal gammopathy ) . Prior IVIG use alone would meet exclusion criterion , investigator consider potential hypercoagulable state . Subjects , judgment site investigator , unlikely comply requirement protocol , include uncontactable follow discharge hospital . Medical condition receipt 500600 mL intravenous fluid may dangerous subject ( e.g. , decompensated congestive heart failure ) .</criteria>
