	<brief_summary>The overall goal study create simulation environment repeat practice resident intense , immediate feedback . Repeated simulation neonatal resuscitation couple clinical experience show improve resident confidence.The investigator seek determine resident exposure individual training video laryngoscopy use C-MAC video laryngoscope would improve cognitive skill decrease intubation time neonatal manikin . The primary outcome time intubation one year . The secondary outcome ability retain cognitive instruction relate intubation</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : Tracheal intubation infant child critical lifesaving skill , many upper level pediatric resident unable successfully intubate neonate pediatric patient timely manner . Simulation show effective teach procedural skill , know improvement intubation skill persist . The investigator seek determine video laryngoscopy could use enhance resident intubation skill would retain one year . Methods : There 67 Pediatric Internal Medicine/Pediatric resident , level 1-4 , complete study randomize month service non-intervention ( NI , n= 36 ) intervention ( IN , n=31 ) group . IN resident observe intubation portion Neonatal Resuscitation Program ( NRP ) training video receive cognitive instruction 30 minute hand instruction use video laryngoscope . At study 's conclusion , 12 month enrollment , resident complete survey intubation live patient past year , cognitive assessment intubation , time intubating manikin . Results analyze Student 's T-Test .</detailed_description>
