	<brief_title>Phase II Trial Tesamorelin Cognition Aging HIV-Infected Persons</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV infection result memory think difficulty people , even successfully treated antiretroviral medication . Tesamorelin injectable medication already approve U.S. FDA treat abdominal fat accumulation HIV . Abdominal fat accumulation link memory thinking difficulty , previous study suggest tesamorelin also may beneficial memory thinking , test HIV . The aim study test whether tesamorelin , combination text-messaging application help motivation adherence , significantly improve memory think HIV . We plan enroll 100 volunteer HIV infection 2 site - University California , San Diego University Southern California . Before entry , volunteer require show evidence abdominal obesity minimum level memory think difficulty cognitive test . This randomized trial volunteer 60 % chance initially receive tesamorelin ( immediate group ) 40 % chance initially receive treatment ( deferred group ) . Subsequently , defer group ( initially receive treatment ) receive tesamorelin 6 month initially receive tesamorelin receive treatment 6 month . Volunteers train use 2-way text-messaging system help research team support volunteer ' ability take study medication direct . We measure volunteer ' memory thinking skill end treatment . We collect blood various point study check safety treatment determine effect body . Volunteers also ask magnetic resonance scan head abdomen monitor effect study medication brain chemistry abdominal fat .</detailed_description>
