	<brief_summary>Resistant hypertension ( RH ) affect 10 % 15 % patient hypertension . These patient clearly increase risk end organ damage mortality . Furthermore , arterial hypertension multifactorial disease include genetic , lifestyle , dietary , metabolic , sympathetic factor . However , current treatment modality optimal target compensatory change sympathetic nervous system function new strategy warrant . Baroreflex activation therapy ( BAT ) special treatment option patient RH modulate autonomic nervous system restore sympathovagal balance . Notably , BAT long-term safety efficacy large-scale , randomize , double blind , control trial show . However , trial design BAT methodology result first generation Rheos® system achieve prespecified endpoint short-term safety efficacy . Notably , second-generation minimally invasive BAT system ( Barostim Neo® ) develop address limitation although randomize , double blind , control clinical trial still lack . Noteworthy , recent European Society Hypertension/European Society Cardiology ( ESH/ESC ) Guidelines management arterial hypertension , carotid baroreceptor stimulation mention one option treat resistant hypertension . Based data aim randomize , double-blind , parallel-design clinical trial examine effect BAT compare continuous pharmacotherapy blood pressure , well arterial cardiac function structure use non-invasive high technology methodology , Nordic multicentre study . This study include 100 patient RH ( 20 Helsinki ) . Eligible patient 18 70 year daytime systolic ambulatory blood pressure 145 mmHg , and/or daytime diastolic ambulatory blood pressure 95 mmHg , witness intake antihypertensive treatment ( include least 3 antihypertensive drug preferably include diuretic ) , change medication minimum 4 week prior enrolment . Patients severe renal insufficiency , type 1 diabetes , psychiatric illness , severe cardiovascular disease , complication risk plan surgery exclusion criterion . The primary end point test whether BAT reduce 24-hour systolic ambulatory blood pressure 8 month follow-up compare continuous pharmacotherapy . Secondary end point test whether BAT reduce home blood pressure follow-up compare continuous pharmacotherapy , whether BAT reduces office blood pressure follow-up compare continuous pharmacotherapy , effect BAT autonomic function measure eg . baroreflex sensitivity heart rate variability .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Eligible patient daytime systolic ambulatory blood pressure 145 mmHg , and/or daytime diastolic ambulatory blood pressure 95 mmHg , witness intake antihypertensive treatment ( include least 3 antihypertensive drug preferably include diuretic ) , change medication minimum 4 week prior enrolment . Patients secondary cause hypertension exclude . Further exclusion criterion renal insufficiency estimate glomerular filtration rate ≤30 ml/min/1.73 m2 ( use Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology [ CKDEPI ] formula ) , untreated sleep apnoea , pregnancy , type 1 diabetes , alcohol substance abuse psychiatric illness , heart rhythm sinus ( well control atrial fibrillation contraindication ) , uncontrolled systolic heart failure ( ejection fraction le 40 % echocardiography ) , aortic stenosis ( mean gradient 25 mmHg echocardiography ) . Myocardial infarction , hypertensive crisis , symptomatic orthostatic hypotension , unstable angina , syncope , cerebral vascular accident within 3 month enrolment also exclusion criterion . Furthermore , know suspect baroreflex failure autonomic neuropathy , carotid artery stenosis well prior surgery , radiation , endovascular stent placement carotid sinus region side , well complication risk plan surgery exclusion criterion .</criteria>
