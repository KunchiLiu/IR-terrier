	<brief_summary>Depending disease stage , testicular cancer ( TC ) treatment consist orchidectomy , alone follow radiotherapy ( RT ) platinum-based chemotherapy ( CT ) . TC survival rate 90 % nowadays , result grow TC survivor population . Because long life expectancy survivor , prevention early detection late treatment effect become increasingly relevant . Yet know late effect nephrotoxicity , cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , secondary malignant neoplasm ( SMN ) , neurotoxicity , pulmonary toxicity , Raynaud 's phenomenon , hypogonadism , fatigue psychosocial problem . Nephrotoxicity important late effect , data lack long-term survivor since perform study follow-up duration 5-14 year . Decreased renal function know risk factor CVD development also association renal function neurtoxicity via circulate platinum level show . It hypothesize treatment induced nephrotoxicity prevalent TC survivor might mediator development late effect . The secondary aim assess prevalence late effect long-term TC survivor : , data collect questionnaire large epidemiological study TC survivor till approximately 10 year treatment . The prevalence late effect may increase time : 10 year treatment late effect may present yet , whilst late effect emerge 20 year . Consequently , health status possible late effect , result morbidity , underestimated patient 20-30 year treatment . By investigate health status long-term survivor profound insight prevalence aetiology late effect development time assess . Current treatment similar TC treatment 20-30 year ago therefore knowledge late effect relevant currently treat patient . Furthermore , result study , good understand factor issue watch closely follow-up , TC survivor increase risk develop late treatment effect detect early damage overt morbidity occur .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Objective : The aim study compare glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) long-term testicular cancer ( TC ) -survivors treat chemotherapy , radiotherapy surgery non-cancer treat healthy control . Secondary aim ass prevalence adverse late treatment effect long-term TC-survivors treat chemotherapy ( CT ) , radiotherapy ( RT ) surgery ( SU ) investigate relationship GFR parameter late effect . Study population : Patients treat CT , RT surgery TC 20 year ago age-matched male control population . Study design : An observational cross-sectional cohort study perform . Patients invite single study visit , consist collection urine 24 hour , withdrawal blood sample , fill questionnaire , physical examination , vascular function structure test , lung function test , digital cooling test , neuropsychological assessment walk test . Main study parameters/endpoints : Primary study parameter renal function express glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) . Secondary endpoint prevalence follow defined adverse late effect : cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) , peripheral neuropathy , reduce lung function , Raynaud 's phenomenon , hypogonadism , fatigue cognitive dysfunction . Other secondary parameter health relate quality life ( HRQoL ) , physical fitness , marker ( subclinical ) vascular damage , single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNPs ) age marker .</detailed_description>
