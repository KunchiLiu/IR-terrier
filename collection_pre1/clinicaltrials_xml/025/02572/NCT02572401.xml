	<brief_summary>African American men far high rate HIV US , randomize control trial ( RCTs ) intervention dissuade heterosexually active African American men engage sexual risk behavior . This research seek address gap behavioral intervention literature . That self-initiated behavior change , well intervention-induced behavior change , often short-lived , eroding time , widely know ; accordingly , research also seek test strategy sustain intervention efficacy . In RCT , African American men 18 45 year report recent unprotected intercourse woman randomize Steering Together New Direction ( STAND ) HIV Risk Reduction Intervention No-Intervention Control Condition . To test strategy sustain intervention effect , men also randomize receive receive individually tailor text message . The theoretical basis intervention social cognitive theory reason action approach , extension theory plan behavior theory reason action . Men complete self-report measure via audio computer-assisted self-interviewing baseline immediately post 6 12 month post-intervention . The trial test whether STAND HIV Risk Reduction Intervention compare No-Intervention Control Condition , increase consistent condom use , primary outcome . Secondary outcome include unprotected intercourse , multiple sexual partner , insertive anal intercourse , proportion condom-protected intercourse . The trial also test whether STAND 's efficacy great among men Text Messaging Intervention compare men receive text message . This provide information utility low-cost strategy extend intervention 's efficacy . Finally , study test mediation intervention effect : hypothesis STAND affect outcome expectancy self-efficacy , , turn , affect consistent condom use .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Steering Together New Direction : Reducing Risk HIV/STD Among African American Men</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>HIV/AIDS devastate impact African Americans , high rate HIV/AIDS compare Whites , Hispanics , Asians , Native Americans . Although African Americans comprise 13 % US population , 40 % people live HIV/AIDS US African Americanâ€”some 192,277 people . New diagnosis HIV/AIDS underscore epidemic 's impact African Americans . Almost 50 % people newly diagnose HIV/AIDS 33 state confidential name-based HIV infection reporting 2006 African Americans . The overall rate newly diagnose case 19 case per 100,000 , among African Americans , 68 per 100,000 . The estimate rate HIV/AIDS 2006 high among African American men ( 121 per 100,000 ) compare White men ( 17 per 100,000 ) , Latino/Hispanic men ( 51 per 100,000 ) , African American woman ( 57 per 100,000 ) . Heterosexual exposure key HIV transmission category among African Americans . To sure , large number estimate case HIV/AIDS among African American men fell men sex men ( MSM ) HIV-transmission category . However , second large number case attribute heterosexual transmission , injection-drug-use HIV-transmission category rank third . Moreover , heterosexual exposure important HIV-transmission category among African American men among men . It account 23 % HIV/AIDS case among African American men , 19 % among Hispanic men 7 % case among White men . Furthermore , among African American woman , comprise 60 % woman HIV/AIDS 2006 , heterosexual exposure far important transmission category , account 83 % case . Heterosexual exposure especially important Philadelphia , PA , propose study conduct . According Philadelphia Department Public Health , among African American men , heterosexual exposure surpass male-to-male contact modal exposure category 2006 , 2007 , 2008 . Furthermore , another important health disparity affect African Americans particularly urban area high rate sexually transmit disease ( STD ) . About 47 % case Chlamydia trachomatis ( CT ) report Centers Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) 2006 occur African Americans . The CT rate 7 time higher among African American woman among White woman . The Neisseria gonorrhea rate 25 time higher among African American men among White men 14 time higher among African American woman among White counterpart . Despite high rate heterosexual exposure HIV high rate STDs African American men woman , little research focus intervention target heterosexually active men . Sexual Risk Behavior among Heterosexually Active African American Men Two key behavior increase risk STD , include HIV , fail use condom consistently multiple sexual partner . Although unmarried African American men likely report consistent condom use Hispanic White counterpart , may reflect recognition high risk STD among African American men , large percentage African American men ( 47 % ) risk exposure HIV STDs . Moreover , consistent condom use decline substantially increase age , 68 % 15 19 year age , 31 % 25 29 year age , 26 % 40 44 year age . In National Survey Family Growth , among men 15-44 year age , unmarried African American men likely 4 partner past year ( 13 % ) compare White ( 6 % ) Hispanic men ( 7 % ) . Interventions Reduce Risk Heterosexual Transmission HIV African American Men Whether one consider domestic international literature , randomize control trial ( RCTs ) intervention focus risk heterosexual transmission HIV among men . Of particular concern paucity trial efficacy risk-reduction intervention specifically target African American men . A systematic review HIV/STD risk-reduction intervention find 12 1157 intervention study worldwide conduct male , 4 focus exclusively African American adult men . A recent review intervention reduce heterosexual transmission HIV among African Americans identify 38 RCTs , 7 target male 2 7 focused adolescent boy . Thus , 5 38 trial focus specifically African American men . Combining study identify 2 review yield 6 trial specifically heterosexual transmission among African American adult men 1 focus general population heterosexual men . A recent clinic-based study 266 African American men 18 29 year age diagnose STD encourage . At 3-month follow-up , randomize single session one-on-one intervention report few unprotected sex act receive standard clinical care . In addition , medical-records review reveal intervention participant less likely acquire new STD 6 month post-intervention control men . Although exist study important first step begin develop intervention African American men , still important gap literature note Seal Ehrhardt assert heterosexual men 's sexual reproductive health often exclusively view context female partner . They call intervention focus men 's health consider men 's heterosexual behavior start point intervention development . Sustaining Intervention-Induced Behavior Change As evidence accumulate benefit behavioral intervention also clear often effect short live . The present study test efficacy relatively inexpensive strategy sustain behavior change . Many strategy employ . The inclusion booster session intervention program suggest strategy extend effect , strategy consistent relapse prevention approach employ substance-abuse reduction smoke cessation program . Several HIV risk-reduction intervention study incorporate booster intervention , exist study provide clear evidence efficacy booster per se , design compare effect HIV/STD risk-reduction intervention booster effect intervention without booster . In addition booster session , may effective method extend intervention effect . Telephone counsel program show help smoker process quit . Periodic mailing also find effective telephone hot line prevent relapse among former cigarette smoker . This study test whether text message extend HIV risk-reduction intervention 's efficacy . The use text message several advantage . It relatively inexpensive , possibly even cost effective phone print-based intervention . Participants return another intervention session , facilitator conduct session , space must make available . Text message deliver almost immediately stored recipient 's phone , accessible time suit . Tailored message efficacious untailored message , text message individually tailor promote condom use men fail use different reason . Pew survey reveal great majority African Americans cell phone , African Americans intense frequent user phone ' capability Whites , African Americans Whites use text messaging . Although RCTs text-messaging intervention report significant effect healthful behavior , include reduce cigarette smoking , increase adherence insulin regimens diabetic , increase medical appointment keep , trial examine whether text message enhance efficacy HIV risk-reduction intervention . The study utilize RCT design . Participants recruit advertise local free newspaper , community base organization serve African Americans , recruitment flyer university , bar , health club , health fair , face-to-face recruitment social sport event activity expect high turnout African American men . Computer-generated random number sequence use randomize Steering Together New Direction ( STAND ) HIV Risk Reduction Intervention No-Intervention Control Condition receive receive Text Messaging Intervention . Participants complete assessment via audio computer-assisted self-interviewing intervention immediately post 6 12 month post-intervention administer data collector blind participant randomly assign condition . The trial test whether STAND intervention increase consistent use condom decrease sexual risk behavior compare no-intervention control group , whether text message efficacious , whether efficacy STAND intervention enhance among men receive text message .</detailed_description>
