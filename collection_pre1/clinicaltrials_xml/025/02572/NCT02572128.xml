	<brief_summary>The investigator study compare iron , respectively iron zinc bioavailability fortify rice produce different fortification technique use stable isotopic label . Study 1 aim compare iron bioavailability hot cold extrude rice , Study 2 iron zinc bioavailability rice use one coating technique hot extrusion compare .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Mineral Absorption From Fortified Rice Produced With Different Fortification Techniques</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Both study randomize single-blind , cross-over design . Study 1 conduct Institute Nutrition Health ( IFNH ) , Swiss Federal Institute Technology ( ETH ) Zurich exclusively ; Study 2 conduct partly Clinical Trials Center ( CTC ) Zurich Institute Nutrition Health ( IFNH ) . Study 1 : From initial screen interested candidate , investigator include 20 participant participate study . The participant consume two different test meal contain 48g regular Basmati rice 2g fortified rice vegetable sauce ( random order define study plan ) . The meal base fortified rice fortify 57FePP , ZnO micronutrient mix , produce hot ( meal A ) cold ( meal B ) extrusion . The micronutrient mix contain per serve meal 170 µg Folic acid , 1.3 µg vitamin B12 , 0.195 mg Vitamin A , 0.65 mg thiamin , 9.1 mg niacin , 0.78 mg vitamin B6 ( 17 ) well 1,26 mg citric acid 36,16 mg trisodium-citrate serve enhancer iron absorption . Randomization include random order test meal A B . Stable iron isotope incorporate fortified rice . The whole study duration screen last contact participant 1 month ( 36 day , include screen ) . At screen , day test meal administration study endpoint visit , participant spend 30 minute IFNH morning ( 0700 - 0900h ) . Study 2 : From initial screen interested candidate , 24 non-pregnant non-lactating woman recruit . The participant randomly assign one 3 cohort ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) . The difference cohort time study-start time reference meal administration . The participant consume two different test meal ( random order define study plan ) one reference meal . The meal base rice fortify stable isotope iron ( 57FePP ) zinc ( 67ZnO ) well micronutrient mix , produce coat rice Wright Enrichment Inc. ( meal A ) hot extrude rice produce ETH Zurich ( meal B ) . The reference meal ( meal C ) consist extrude rice micronutrient mix ( extra add iron zinc ) regular rice 58FeSO4 ( Ferrous Sulfate ) solution add prior consumption . Randomization include random order test meals A B . Meal C give one day first ( cohort 1 ) second ( cohort 2 ) test meal . Additionally , stable zinc isotope give subject intravenously . The whole study duration screen last contact participant 2 month ( 51 day include screen ) . At screen day test meal administration , participant spend 20 - 30 minute IFNH CTC morning ( 0700 - 0900h ) . For study , blood sample use determine iron bioavailability . In Study 2 , additional urine sample collect determine zinc bioavailability . The baseline blood urine sample blood sample collect 14 day ( Study 1 ) , respectively 15 day ( Study 2 ) , test meal administration well urine sample collect 4 day ( 96 hour ) test meal administration analyze inductively couple plasma mass spectrometry ( ICP-MS ) isotope enrichment , fractional well absolute Fe Zn absorption calculate test meal subject .</detailed_description>
