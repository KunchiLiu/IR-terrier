	<brief_summary>BACKGROUND : In patient high risk stage II stage III colon cancer ( CC ) , curative surgery follow adjuvant chemotherapy FOLFOX CAPOX regimens become standard treatment . However , 20 30 % patient develop distant metastasis , ultimately result death . Perioperative chemotherapy promise strategy potential benefit could effective eradicate micrometastases . Moreover , shrink tumor surgery facilitate removal tumor surgeon also reduce tumor cell spread procedure . With recent advance radiology , preoperative compute tomography robust method measure depth tumor invasion identify CC patient poor prognosis , may benefit perioperative chemotherapy . The investigator conduct present randomize study explore whether perioperative chemotherapy FOLFOX CAPOX regimens compare postoperative chemotherapy could improve disease-free survival patient radiologically stag , locally advanced , resectable colon cancer . OBJECTIVE : The primary objective study evaluate efficacy perioperative chemotherapy FOLFOX CAPOX regimens compare postoperative chemotherapy patient locally advanced colon cancer . Secondary objective efficacy term R0 resection rate , overall survival ( OS ) , relapse-free survival ( RFS ) , down-staging primary tumor , tolerability perioperative therapy postoperative complication .</brief_summary>
