	<brief_summary>The Ablative Solutions , Inc . Peregrine System Infusion Catheter catheter-based device intend used ablate afferent efferent sympathetic nerve serve kidney . The catheter insert via femoral artery , steer renal artery , delivers , infusion distal end , neurolytic agent . This target nerve bundle , adventitia - sheath surround artery . The aim reduce blood pressure case hypertension , include seriously elevate blood pressure respond drug treatment . This study evaluate safety performance device .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>The Peregrine Post-Market Study Treatment Hypertension</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>There strong evidence publish literature renal nerve important contributor hypertension , ablation adverse side-effects . The literature provide technical , clinical scientific evidence support use perivascular renal denervation carefully define patient group . An exist device ( Medtronic Symplicity catheter ) initially show safe effective achieve perivascular renal denervation delivery radio-frequency energy . The result early nonrandomized clinical study ( HTN-1 , HTN-2 ) find perivascular renal denervation radio-frequency energy delivery effective therapy , associate low risk . In context , denervation also safely effectively achieve neurolytic agent . The ASI Peregrine System™ Infusion Catheter denervation procedure general similar enough Medtronic Symplicity catheter enable use publish data establish validity design concept Peregrine System estimate likely level risk side effect . It conclude literature ASI Peregrine System™ achieve percutaneous renal denervation low risk procedural complication ( comparable accept percutaneous interventional therapy ) without long-term impairment renal artery kidney function serious adverse event . Previous premarket clinical trial provide support safe effective use Peregrine Catheter treatment patient hypertension . The Peregrine System Infusion Catheter currently CE mark indication use `` The Peregrine System™ Infusion Catheter intend infusion neurolytic agent achieve reduction systemic blood pressure hypertensive patient . '' Based upon literature previous clinical data , chemical denervation appropriate treatment specify study population adult hypertension despite take least 3 anti-hypertensive drug different class include least one diuretic . The objective post-market study collect additional safety performance data pertain renal denervation use dehydrate alcohol chemical neurolytic agent deliver adventitial/peri-adventitial area renal artery purpose renal denervation , use Peregrine System™ Infusion Catheter , patient hypertension . In order study valid , one chemical neurolytic agent use . The Coordinating Investigator chosen use dehydrate alcohol ( le 95 % volume ) therapeutic neurolysis , therefore participate site usethis agent .</detailed_description>
