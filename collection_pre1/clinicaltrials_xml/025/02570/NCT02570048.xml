	<brief_summary>This novel experimental device 'MuteButton ' affect awareness tinnitus . Sound arrive ear naturally present form touch pattern tongue . By learn associate sound ear sound pattern tongue , investigator aim demonstrate brain learn discriminate real sound legitimate external sound imaginary tinnitus sound create inside brain . Tinnitus audiological condition commonly describe 'ringing ear ' affect estimate 40 million people globally ( American Tinnitus Association ; Royal National Institute Deaf ) . More accurately , tinnitus perception illusory sound legitimate external source normally arise small number underlying neuropathologies . There broadly two category tinnitus Somatic Tinnitus Hearing Loss Related Tinnitus . MuteButton indicate treatment permanent intractable subjective tinnitus . The study intend show efficacy MuteButton treatment alleviate tinnitus . The objective study determine impact acoustic tactile multi-modal neuromodulation symptom permanent intractable tinnitus measure objective subjective measure include Minimum Masking Level ( MML ) , Tinnitus Loudness Masking ( Tinnitus Loudness Masking ) , Tinnitus Handicap Inventory ( THI ) Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study prospective single arm pilot study . It conduct approval Research Ethics Committee NUI Maynooth The Hermitage Medical Clinic Lucan collaboration Mutebutton Ltd , Nova UCD . This study conduct 16-week period 60 suffering permanent intractable tinnitus ( &gt; 6 month ) accompanying/ co-existing high-frequency hearing-loss . Participants screen 4-week run-in period prior commencement treatment baseline measure obtain sample every 2 week . Following run-in period receive treatment 10 week follow 2 week post-treatment . For duration study assess every 2 week clinical environment . Participants give IFU ( Appendix 3 ) along device give step step instruction use , detailed description control , indicator connection . Participants use MuteButton device minimum 1 hour day period 10 week . The efficacy intervention assess change several psychoascoutic assessment assess every 6 follow visit investigator 2 week interval . The Psychoacoustic Assessment include : Tinnitus Matching ( Pitch ) - symptom severity Tinnitus Loudness Matching ( TLM ) - symptom severity Minimum Masking Level ( MML ) - symptom severity Questionnaires utilised include : Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) - symptom severity Tinnitus Handicap Inventory ( THI ) - symptom severity A primary endpoint 16 week show reduction THI , psychoacoustic assessment establish . Secondary endpoint include reduction MML , psychoacoustic assessment establish .</detailed_description>
