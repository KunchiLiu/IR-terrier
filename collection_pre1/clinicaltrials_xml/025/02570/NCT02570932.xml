	<brief_title>Administration Expanded Autologous Adult Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Cells Established Chronic Spinal Cord Injuries</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This clinical trial phase II , single-center , non-randomized , uncontrolled , open prospective follow-up cohort patient chronic spinal cord injury . Patients treat repeated administration vitro expand autologous adult bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell . The expanded cell administer subarachnoid space lumbar puncture . The minimum duration follow-up period patient 10 month first administration . The study duration 24 month , include recruit , treatment follow period patient . For patient first day administer first cellular dos , 3 dos administrate every 3 month . At end clinical trial , complete check obtain parameter perform . It consider Day 1 patient first day first cell administration . The remain 2 dos administer interval 3 month first administration ( treatment period , month 4 7 ) . At end study perform full assessment variable collect along study trial .</detailed_description>
