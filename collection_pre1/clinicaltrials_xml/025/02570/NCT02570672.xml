	<brief_summary>Frailty geriatric syndrome lead poor health outcome old adult , fall , disability , hospitalization , institutionalization , death . Due dramatic growth U.S. age population health care cost associate frailty ( estimate $ 18 billion per year ) , frailty major health care problem . There little research potential pharmacologic intervention would delay reduce incidence frailty . Thus , major goal study test metformin novel intervention prevention frailty . The investigator propose diabetes/insulin resistance inflammation major contributor frailty , use metformin modulate diabetes/insulin resistance inflammation prevent and/or ameliorate progression frailty .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Metformin Preventing Frailty High-risk Older Adults</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Physical frailty geriatric syndrome lead poor health outcome fall , disability , institutionalization , death . The prevalence frailty estimate 7-15 % among community-dwelling old U.S. adult . The associated cost frailty estimate $ 18 billion 2000 continue increase next two decade . Thus , increasingly frail old population major implication demand health care service , include hospital usage , home care , long-term care . Data several study suggest strong role diabetes insulin resistance , associate increased inflammation , physiological basis frailty . The investigator ' recent epidemiological research community-based population older adult show diabetes significant predictor frailty onset worsen time . While importance frailty impact age U.S. society widely recognize , date effective intervention prevent treat frailty . Therefore , major goal study test drug insulin-sensitizing anti-inflammatory property , metformin , novel intervention frailty prevention . The investigator hypothesize metformin lead reduce inflammation insulin resistance present old glucose-intolerant subject change consequently prevent onset and/or progression frailty sub-population older adult . Subjects impair glucose intolerance enrol study group encompass approximately 1/3rd old population , group increase risk develop diabetes frailty , likely benefit potential anti-inflammatory insulin-sensitizing intervention .</detailed_description>
