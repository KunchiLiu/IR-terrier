	<detailed_description>The override hypothesis structure preoperative cognitive screening senior feasible without specialized staff help preoperatively identify person high risk complication . To demonstrate generalizability single center experience , strengthen case routine preoperative cognitive screening senior , aim proposal implement preoperative cognitive screening senior preoperative clinic community hospital ( NWH ) 2nd tertiary care institution ( MGH ) ; determine whether impairment independent predictor adverse perioperative event . We enroll senior ( ≥ 65 year age ) present Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) Newton-Wellesley Hospital ( NWH ) elective noncardiac , non-neurological surgery require hospital admission ( N = 250 ) . Study staff deploy one site day accord randomization scheme avoid bias ( thus , site , recruitment average occur 10 per month ) . A study team member obtain informed consent patient agree participate satisfies eligibility criterion . Exclusion criterion plan ICU admission postoperatively ; history stroke brain tumor ; uncorrected vision hearing impairment ( unable see picture read hear instruction ) ; limit use dominant hand ( limited ability draw ) ; and/or inability speak , read understand English.Study staff use computerize scheduling system , update continuously real time capture relevant information age procedure , identify potential subject . When patient check receptionist appointment notify may eligible participate study CPE involve patient age 65 . The receptionist provide brochure study include information purpose study , risk patient , potential benefit society . The patient ask willing speak one study investigator patient agree speak study investigator approach . The staff member describe goal risk study quiet room ask patient choose participate . After question answer patient opportunity read consent form , write consent obtain one study investigator . After obtain informed consent , interviewer ask patient informant ( available ) `` Have speak doctor evaluate change memory thinking ? '' Study staff also gather variety demographic , functional , medical information direct questioning review medical record . Specifically , collect data age , year education , live situation , history fall , ASA physical status , metabolic equivalent ( METS ) , medication history , Charlson Comorbidity index . We administer standard instrument assess mood ( Geriatric Depression Scale-Short [ GDS ] , 15-item self-report questionnaire , health functional status ( basic instrumental activity daily live [ ADLs IADLs , respectively , SF36 ] ) , measure grip strength Jamar hand dynamometer index frailty.The SF36 survey profile physical mental health quality-of-life . In addition , take one-minute administer Animal Fluency Test . This cognitive screen show useful identifying patient risk develop postoperative delirium . The World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 also administer potential alternative SF36 measure physical health disability . Each enrol patient also receive business card listing investigator ' contact information advise expect follow telephone call 6 month surgery verify data element reassess functional outcome.The MiniCog use preoperative cognitive screening . Preoperative clinic staff perform score MiniCog preoperative visit , study staff member independently score test subsequently . The MiniCog involve 3-item recall memory clock draw test serf distractor . The MiniCog test visuospatial representation , recall , executive function . The MiniCog take 2-4 min complete validate community-based population , minimal education , language , ethnic bias , high sensitivity specificity impaired cognition , age-adjusted normative data available . Moreover , pilot data BWH show MiniCog well accept geriatric surgical patient , easy caregiver different type administer score , high inter-rater reliability preoperative clinic setting . Probable cognitive impairment define MiniCog score ≤ 2 ( 5 ) ordinal score also consider data analysis . A score ≤ 2 standard cutoff ~75 % sensitivity ~90 % great specificity MCI dementia compare longer screen assessment instrument . Primary outcome measure feasibility ( Aim 1 ) rate successful testing ( score-able test ) accuracy score ( vs. investigator ) . Secondary feasibility outcome measure perspective practitioner cognitive screening ( survey MGH NWH CPE staff ) impact test patient flow institution . The latter obtain extract compare data CPE 's computerized patient flow track system time spend provider preoperative evaluation room total duration CPE visit ( check-in time departure time ) enrol subject age procedure match patient see CPE previous year . The primary patient outcome ( Aim 2 ) delirium , discharge place home , functional outcome ( change SF36 ) ; secondary outcome hospital length stay ( LOS ) , complication ( include in-hospital fall ) , 30 readmission rate mortality . Delirium assess directly postoperative day 1 , 2 , 3 member study team use Confusion Assessment Method ( CAM ) , well-validated measure delirium surgical patients.The remain outcome data extract medical record electronic database . Both institution track time spend CPE ( provider , lab , wait room , etc . ) databases tabulate numerous element hospital event age , gender , race , surgical service , procedure , DRG code , admit discharge date ( LOS ) , discharge disposition ( home , home service , rehabilitation , skilled nursing facility ) .</detailed_description>
