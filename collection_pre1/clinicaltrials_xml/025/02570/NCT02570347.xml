	<brief_summary>Clinicians tend overuse antibiotic snake bite despite evidence three previous clinical trial fail show benefit . But , none trial do India . Further , specie snake two trial quite different see Indian set limit generalization finding . Hence , home-grown evidence need persuade clinician use antibiotic rationally .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Routine Antibiotic v . Directed Antibiotic Treatment Snake Bite</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Snake bite common clinical problem India elsewhere , affect agricultural worker rural population , result thousand death every year . Apart cause systemic manifestation coagulopathy , acute renal failure , neuroparalysis , local effect venom manifest swell bitten limb . Despite administration adequate antivenom , limb swell progress first 48-72 hour accompany considerable pain . Often limb swell accompany formation bleb gangrenous skin change . At time , limb swell severe enough result compartment syndrome , necessitate surgical intervention fasciotomy debridement . Animal bite typically associate risk infection oral flora . Likewise , apart release venom , inoculation oral flora result snake bite could result local infectious complication add deleterious effect snake venom . Observational study suggest risk infection follow simple bite low limbs much less often believe , evidence clinical trial also support routine use antibiotic snake bite . For reason , clinical practice guideline recommend routine prophylactic use antibiotic snake bite . But , reality , many clinician continue use antibiotic routinely venomous snake bite hop prevent local infection . While strategy may reduce risk infection , would result overuse antibiotic promote antimicrobial resistance escalate treatment cost . The investigator hypothesize clinically-directed use antibiotic would non-inferior routine use prevent local infectious complication snake bite , superior reduce antibiotic consumption . Non-inferiority would infer one-sided 95 % CI difference exceed 10 % favour routine use arm .</detailed_description>
