	<brief_summary>Oral dosage regimens fosfomycin tromethamine ( Monurol™ ) establish treatment cUTI . The common recommend adult dosage regimen literature single-dose sachet contain equivalent 3 gram fosfomycin administer every day ( QOD ) total three dos . There myriad different oral fosfomycin dose regimen currently use clinical practice , include 3 gram orally twice daily 7-21 day , regimen base solid pharmacokinetic , pharmacodynamic safety rationale . Initial pharmacokinetic study perform oral fosfomycin tromethamine primarily examine single dose regimen use modern day bioanalytical pharmacokinetic technique . As use fosfomycin become pervasive concordance increase multidrug resistant pathogen , pharmacokinetic safety data need intensive dosing regimen support continue use . The rationale study oral fosfomycin tromethamine require modern pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study identify alternative oral dosage regimen appropriate safe . This study provide safety/tolerability clinical pharmacology information regard two oral dose regimen may application treat various type infection involve resistant pathogen oral antibacterial option available .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study design randomize , two-way crossover trial involve 24 randomized participant anticipate drop-out rate high 25 % give total 18 evaluable healthy adult participant . The study fully explain participant , informed consent obtain , IRB-approved inform consent form sign study procedure initiate . All participant undergo screen assessment within 30 day prior initial dose determine eligibility enrollment study . All participant must meet inclusion exclusion criterion undergo screen procedure include complete medical history , physical examination , assessment clinical laboratory parameter ( chemistry hematology ) , ECG , pregnancy test ( female child bear potential ) . Randomization stratify gender , use permuted block . Within gender , eligible participant randomize equal probability one 2 treatment sequence show Table 3 . According sequence participant randomize , participant initially receive one two oral dosage regimens fosfomycin : 3 g every day x 3 dos 3 g once-daily x 7 dos . After completion initial dose regimen participant cross receive dose regimen . There minimum 5-day , recommended maximum 14-day , washout period prior start next dose regimen . Blood urine sample collect throughout study well detailed drug administration adverse event data participant . Fosfomycin tromethamine sachet ( Monurol™ ) use study . Each participant instruct stir dissolve single-dose sachet 3 4 ounce water , take dose immediately dissolve water . Compliance assess participant interview ( every 2 day ) count empty sachet . Participants report outpatient study center Day -30 -1 study criterion review , clinical assessment , blood collection screen laboratory test prior fosfomycin administration . Each participant participate study 120 day ( i.e. , screening visit ; day -1 clinical assessment blood collection ; day 1-7 fosfomycin administration sample collection period ; day 8-10 follow-up assessment ; cross receive dose regimen schedule event .</detailed_description>
