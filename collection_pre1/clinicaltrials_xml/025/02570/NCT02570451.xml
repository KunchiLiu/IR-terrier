	<brief_summary>The overall objective study improve outcome surgical patient 65 year age old risk stratification base preoperative screen cognition / mental function . Aim 1 determine prevalence cognitive impairment among patient 65 year age old present elective joint replacement surgery structure cognitive screening versus standard practice . Aim 2 ascertain whether preoperative cognitive impairment patient 65 year age old undergoing elective joint replacement surgery independent predictor adverse postoperative event and/or mortality . Aim 3 implement routine structure preoperative cognitive screening patient 65 year age old undergoing elective surgical procedure busy preoperative clinic .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This prospective , single-center observational study patient 65 year age old undergoing elective surgical procedure . Phase 1 ( Aims 1 2 ) , examine prevalence preoperative cognitive impairment relationship postoperative outcome . In Phase 2 ( Aim 3 ) , implement routine structure cognitive screening busy surgical preadmission evaluation center confirm utility predict adverse perioperative outcome elder . For Phase 1 , 211 randomly select patient 65 year age old either gender enrol present Brigham Women 's Hospital Weiner Center Preoperative Evaluation ( CPE ) schedule elective joint replacement surgery . The Brigham Women 's Hospital performs 600 joint replacement procedure year patient 65 year age old . This age range cognitive impairment become prevalent postoperative cognitive non-cognitive morbidity common . Exclusion criteria patient diagnosed dementia cognitive impairment ; schedule procedure affect brain cerebrovasculature ( i.e . intracranial neurosurgery , carotid endarterectomy , cardiac surgery ) ; plan go ICU postoperatively ; uncorrected vision hearing impairment ( see picture read hear instruction ) ; unable use dominant hand ( limited ability draw ) ; and/or unable speak , read understand English . The investigator use CPE computerize schedule system , update continuously real time capture relevant information age procedure identify potential subject . When patient check receptionist appointment notify may eligible participate study involve patient 65 year age old . The receptionist provide brochure study include information purpose study , risk patient , potential benefit society . The patient ask willing speak one study investigator patient agree speak study investigator approach . A member study team contact patient verify satisfy inclusion criterion discuss goal risk study ask participate . After question answer patient opportunity read consent form , write consent obtain . After obtain consent patient interview member study team obtain information year education self-reported functional status accord standardize scale basic instrumental activity daily live ( ADLs IADLs , respectively ) . Grip strength index frailty mood assess Geriatric Depression Scale-Short ( GDS ) . An investigator also administer survey assess patient 's perspective importance preoperative cognitive screening . Information ASA physical status , medication , Charlson comorbidity index extract subsequently patient 's electronic medical record patient interview . The patient administer MiniCog simple cognitive screening tool take 2-4 min complete little education , language , race bias . During phase project , train study team member administer test quiet evaluation room . The practitioner conduct actual preoperative evaluation blind cognitive test result complete questionnaire patient 's cognitive status base interaction visit . A trained , blind member study team score test . Discharge place home use primary outcome determine relationship pre-existing cognitive impairment patient outcome ( Aim 2 ) . As secondary outcome delirium assess per day postoperative day 1 , 2 , 3 member study team use Confusion Assessment Method ( CAM ) well-validated measure delirium surgical patient . Other secondary outcome evaluate include use restraint , hospital length stay ( LOS ) , complication ( include in-hospital fall ) , 30 readmission rate , 30 , 6 month , 1 year 5 year mortality . Data extract medical record BWH Balanced Scorecard . Phase 2 examine feasibility implement routine structure cognitive screen elective surgical procedure busy preoperative evaluation center . 500 patient enrol accord criterion outline ask CPE practitioner administer structure cognitive screen patient â‰¥ 65 year age schedule surgical procedure part routine preoperative evaluation . A study team member train CPE staff administration MiniCog prior begin phase study ; test administer part routine CPE visit . Outcome measure rate successful testing ( score-able test ) , impact test patient flow . The latter obtain extract compare data CPE 's computerized patient flow track system time spend provider preoperative evaluation room total duration CPE visit ( check-in time departure time ) enrol subject age procedure match patient see CPE previous year .</detailed_description>
