	<brief_summary>From cellular perspective , breast cancer appear develop hierarchically small contingent cancer stem cell ( CSCs ) . The presence CSCs tumor tissue associate increase risk recurrence metastasis , well bad prognosis . Thus , CSCs exhibit resistance conventional anti-tumor treatment radiotherapy chemotherapy . Moreover , treatment would favor emergence CSCs reprogramming non-CSCs CSCs . It demonstrate neoadjuvant proportion CSCs treatment correlate chemoresistance resurgence CSCs chemotherapy correlate poor prognosis . However , mechanism involve emergence CSCs reprogramming non-CSCs yet know . The Oscar Lambret Center propose monocentric prospective interventional study base cellular molecular analysis tumor , serum circulate cell , , end treatment patient receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy breast cancer . The identification mechanism contribute enrichment CSCs resistant chemotherapy could lead therapeutic solution .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Patients respond criterion selection sign inform consent form . Before initiation chemotherapy , tumor specimen ( echographic control ) four blood sample collect . The chemotherapy consist 3 cycle ( F ) EC100 space 21 day apart : - Epirubicin , 100 mg/m² intravenous ( IV ) - Cyclophosphamide , 500 mg/m² IV - +/- 5-fluorouracile ( 5FU ) , 500 mg/m² IV Followed 3 cycle Taxotere ( Docetaxel , IV , 100 mg/m² ) space 21 day apart +/- Herceptin ( Trastuzumab , IV , 8 mg/kg C1 6 mg/kg ) 1 year case overexpression HER-2 oncoprotein . After 3 cycle chemotherapy ( say end ( F ) EC100 treatment , time usual ultrasound examination ) , tumor specimen four blood sample take . After 6 cycle chemotherapy ( say end Docetaxel +/- Trastuzumab treatment ) , four blood sample collect . A partial total mastectomy could perform 6 cycle chemotherapy . During surgery , tumor specimen take . The indication breast surgery remain discretion pluridisciplinary committee participate center . Prior start treatment , patient clinical paraclinical examination undergo laboratory examination . On day 1 fourth cycle sixth cycle chemotherapy , patient clinical examination undergo laboratory examination . After three cycle chemotherapy , time intermediate breast ultrasound , patient paraclinical examination . Finally , end study ( partial total mastectomy ) , anatomopathological examination perform operative specimen .</detailed_description>
