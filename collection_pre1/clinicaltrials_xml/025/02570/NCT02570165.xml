	<brief_summary>Batefenterol novel bifunctional molecule combine muscarinic antagonism beta2-agonism single molecule . This multicenter , randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind , parallel group study primarily design assess dose response , efficacy safety five dose regimen batefenterol administer via dry powder inhaler ( DPI ) once-daily morning 42 day subject COPD . The information obtain study use select minimal , optimally effective safe dose batefenterol also evaluate pharmacokinetic profile establish pharmacodynamic ( PD ) responses batefenterol . These data support future study batefenterol COPD subject . The study consist pre-screening visit , screen visit ; run-in period ( 2 week ) , treatment period 42 day follow-up visit 7 day post-treatment . The total duration study subject approximately 9 week . Approximately 460 subject screen order randomize approximately 320 subject , assume 280 subject complete study . During treatment period , subject randomize one follow treatment deliver via DPI daily morning : Batefenterol 37.5 mcg , 75 mcg , 150 mcg , 300 mcg 600 mcg , umeclidinium/vilanterol ( UMEC/VI ) 62.5/25 mcg placebo . All subject receive supplemental albuterol/salbutamol use as-needed basis ( rescue medication ) throughout study .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Type subject : Outpatient Informed Consent : A sign date write informed consent prior study participation Age : 40 year age old Visit 1 . Gender : Male female subject eligible participate study . Female subject eligible participate pregnant ( confirm negative urine human chorionic gonadotrophin [ hCG ] test ) , lactate , least one follow condition applies : Nonreproductive potential define : Premenopausal females one following : Documented tubal ligation Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure followup confirmation bilateral tubal occlusion Hysterectomy Documented Bilateral Oophorectomy Postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one highly effective contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrolment . Reproductive potential agrees follow one option list 30 day prior first dose study medication least five terminal halflives OR continue pharmacologic effect end , whichever longer last dose study medication completion followup visit . This list apply female reproductive potential sex partner , prefer usual lifestyle subject continue abstinent penilevaginal intercourse long term persistent basis . Contraceptive subdermal implant meet &lt; 1 percent ( % ) rate failure per year , state product label Intrauterine device intrauterine system meet &lt; 1 % rate failure per year , state product label Oral Contraceptive , either combined progestogen alone Injectable progestogen Contraceptive vaginal ring Percutaneous contraceptive patch Male partner sterilization documentation azoospermia prior female subject entry study , male sole partner subject These allow method contraception effective use consistently , correctly accordance product label . The investigator responsible ensure subject understand properly use method contraception . Diagnosis : An established clinical history COPD accordance definition American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society follow : Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease preventable treatable disease state characterize airflow limitation fully reversible . The airflow limitation usually progressive associate abnormal inflammatory response lungs noxious particle gas , primarily cause cigarette smoking . Smoking History : Current former cigarette smoker history cigarette smoke &gt; =10 packyears . Former smoker define stop smoke least 6 month prior Visit 1 . Number pack year = ( number cigarette per day / 20 ) x number year smoke ( e.g . 20 cigarette per day 10 year , 10 cigarette per day 20 year equal 10 packyears ) . Note : pipe cigar use calculate packyear history . Severity Disease : A postalbuterol/salbutamol FEV1/FVC ratio &lt; =0.70 postalbuterol/salbutamol FEV1 &gt; =30 &lt; =70 % predict normal Visit 1 . Note : Percent predict calculated use European Respiratory Society Global Lung Function Initiative reference equation . Asthma : Subjects current diagnosis asthma . ( subject prior history asthma eligible current diagnosis COPD ) . Other Respiratory Disorders : Known respiratory disorder COPD include limited alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency , active tuberculosis , bronchiectasis , sarcoidosis , lung fibrosis , pulmonary hypertension unrelated COPD , interstitial lung disease . Allergic rhinitis exclusionary . Other Diseases/Abnormalities : Any significant disease ( include uncontrolled hypertension , diabetes thyroid disease ) opinion investigator study medical monitor would put safety subject risk study participation , would affect study analysis diseases/condition exacerbate study . Hepatitis : Presence hepatitis B surface antigen ( HBsAg ) , positive hepatitis C antibody test result screen Visit 1 within 3 month prior first dose study treatment . ( subject positive hepatitis C antibody due prior resolve disease enrol confirmatory negative Hepatitis C ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) test obtain ) .
