	<brief_title>Phase II Study Ultra-high-dose Hypofractionated vs. Single-dose Image-Guided Radiotherapy Prostate Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The present phase II randomize study evaluate clinical outcome potential treatment-related toxicity follow definitive ultra-high dose per fraction external beam radiation therapy deliver two different regimen patient intermediate-risk adenocarcinoma prostate . An emerge body data suggest extreme hypofractionated radiation schedule , employ ultra-high dose per fraction ( ≥7 Gy ) small number fraction ( ≤5 ) , appear equal superior conventionally-fractionated ( 1.8- 2.0 Gy/fraction ) moderately hypo-fractionated scheme ( 2.5-3.5 Gy/fraction ) term tumor control toxicity profile . Modern computer-driven technology enable implementation ultra-high hypofractionated Image-Guided Radiotherapy ( IGRT ) safely . Prostate cancer patient classify accord current National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN ) guideline intermediate risk ( biopsy Gleason score 7 and/or Prostate Specific Antigen ( PSA ) level &gt; 10 ≤20 ng/mL and/or Stage T1 , T2a , T2b T2c ) eligible study . Extensive experience extreme hypo-fractionation prostate accrue past two year use organ stabilization mean endorectal balloon urethral sparing technique on-line target motion track . The standard dose prescription technique 45 Gy 5 consecutive day . Outcome data intermediate risk patient treat single dose external beam radiotherapy yet available , although experience single dose High Dose Radiotherapy ( HDR ) brachytherapy prostate cancer indicate similar clinical outcome toxicity profile external beam hypofractionated schedule . Experience ultra-high single dose radiotherapy bone soft tissue oligometastatic prostate cancer consistently show locally control &gt; 90 % prostate cancer lesion , clearly indicate sensitivity prostate cancer tissue mode cancer radiotherapy . Stage IV oligometastatic prostate cancer patient fail androgen deprivation therapy treat accord current standard care single dose 24 Gy focus detectable disease , include radiation-naive intraprostatic lesion , excellent early result , use technique employ hypofractionated set . Overall , toxicity profile thus far extremely favorable indicate intermediate range safety technique apply whole prostate radiotherapy . These data suggest single dose therapy properly employ safe effective manage intra-prostatic cancer setting . Taken together , observation provide basis present prospective phase II study . Patients enrol study undergo image-guided , volumetric intensity-modulated arc radiotherapy ( VMAT ) state-of-the-art treatment-planning quality assurance procedure emphasis normal tissue spar delivery accuracy via use device ensure stability beam location reproducibility . A rectal balloon air fill use prostate target immobilization anatomical reproducibility , urethral catheter load beacon transponder use ensure set-up reproducibility online target track . Previously untreated patient intermediate-risk prostate cancer prospectively randomize receive either 45 Gy five fraction 9 Gy vs. 24 Gy single-dose radiotherapy . Patients follow one month post-treatment every 3 month 12 month ( +/- 4 week ) every 6 month thereafter . Acute chronic toxicity evaluation focus , though exclusively , urinary , rectal sexual function assess validated questionnaire . Serum PSA value acquire schedule clinical follow-up . A multiparametric MRI perform baseline , 6 , 12 24 month follow intervention . Additionally , post-treatment diffusion-weighted MRI ( DW-MRI ) perform within 15 minute first treatment . Post-treatment prostate core needle biopsy obtain 24 month evaluate pathologic response therapy.The purpose scan measure early physiologic change , perfusion ischemia , may correlate clinically relevant endpoint . The study continuously monitor minimum 5 year . In event unexpected severe ( grade ≥3 ) toxicities observed one treatment arm , study terminate accord standard stopping rule &gt; 3/first 15 patient .</detailed_description>
