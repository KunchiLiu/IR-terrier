	<brief_title>Impact CD34+ Cell Dose Progression-free Survival Following High-Dose Therapy Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation Relapsed Refractory Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma ( DLBCL )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Following enrollment , patient CD34+ stem cell mobilize discretion treat attend physician plerixafor achievement &gt; 6 x10^6 CD34+ cells/kg . The patient fail mobilize &gt; 6 x10^6 CD34+ cells/kg randomize subsequently follow disease progression overall survival.. Patients &gt; 6 x10^6 CD34+ cells/kg cryopreserved study admit hospital plan ASCT . Patients randomly infuse either 3-4 x 10^6 CD34+ stem cells/kg 6-8 x10^6 CD34+ stem cells/kg d0 per study randomization . The cell dose range within two group allow variability within aliquot cell time cryopreservation . Patients receive standard supportive measure ( include : growth factor support post-HDT/ASCT , antimicrobial prophylaxis , red blood cell platelet transfusion treatment neutropenic fever ) per institutional guideline practice .</detailed_description>
