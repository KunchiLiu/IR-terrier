	<brief_summary>This double-blind , placebo control , ascend dose , multi-cohort trial . The study conduct two phase : single ascend dose ( SAD ) phase `` Part A '' , follow multiple ascend dose ( MAD ) phase `` Part B '' . In Part A , subject receive one dose study drug . In Part B , subject within cohort receive dose daily 14 day . In part , sequential cohort expose increase dos CT1812 order identify maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ascending Dose Study CT1812 Healthy Volunteers</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Part A - Single Ascending Dose 54 Subjects Screening procedure occur Days -21 -3 . Subjects admit clinical research unit 5 day . Administration single dose study drug occur Day 1 . Following completion safety assessment blood draws PK analysis , subject discharge Day 3 Day 4 , depend cohort . Double-blind dose occur cohort 1 6 . In cohort , 6 subject receive CT1812 2 receive placebo . Doses escalate per protocol . In cohort 1 , 2 subject ( 1 placebo/1 active CT1812 ) dose 24 hour prior remain subject cohort . The remain 6 subject dose safety concern identify first 2 subject ( last 6 subject admit research unit one day later initial 2 subject ) . In cohort 2 7 , subject enrol dose together . Following completion cohort , bioanalytical analysis CT1812 PK perform plasma Cmax concentration review . Enrollment additional cohort dose escalation occur safety assessment PK analysis complete prior cohort . The dose escalation plan may adjust response pharmacokinetic analysis , particularly relationship dose Cmax become non-proportional . If MTD maximum allowable exposure establish less 650 mg ( ~8.45 mg/kg ) , few cohort may require , reduce number study subject . Should MTD identify ( i.e . dos well tolerate review PK analyse reveal clinical concern ) , additional cohort higher dos may enrol . The maximum dose administer exceed 1350 mg ( ~18 mg/kg ) . At completion dose escalation , one additional cohort 6 subject administer open-label CT1812 high well-tolerated dose potential therapeutic dose , 30 minute follow standardized meal test food effect . All subject admit clinical research unit Day 0 . Dosing take place morning Day 1 . Blood draws assessment PK parameter occur pre-dose 15 , 30 , 45 , 60 , 90 minute post dose well 2 , 3 , 4 , 8 , 12 , 24 , 36 48 hour post dose . Subjects cohorts 5 6 additional sample drawn 72 hour dose . Subjects release Day 3 4 follow completion blood draw safety assessment . Part B - Multiple Ascending Dose 60 Subjects Following identification MTD Part A analysis pharmacokinetic data Part A , multiple ascend dose Part B commence 4 cohort . Screening procedure occur Days -21 -3 . Subjects admit clinical research unit 17 day . Once daily administration study drug initiate 25 % MTD establish Part A. Dosing occur Days 1 - 14 . Following completion safety assessment blood draws PK analysis , subject discharge Day 16 . In cohort 3 4 , subject undergo lumbar puncture CSF sample CT1812 concentration analysis ( single-point ) steady state Tmax ( time dose TBD ) . In addition cohort 1-4 , two cohort subject age 65 75 may enrol dose follow identification multiple-dose MTD .</detailed_description>
