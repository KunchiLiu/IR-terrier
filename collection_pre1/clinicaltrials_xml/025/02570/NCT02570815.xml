	<brief_summary>Lungs make individual lobe . When lung cancer tumour detect one lobe , surgeon typically perform Lobectomy . A Lobectomy surgery commonly do treat early-stage lung cancer require removal entire lobe lung , remove large amount lung tissue For patient small tumour save much healthy lung tissue possible important . Each lobe lung small section call segment . When lung cancer one segment , possible remove segment , without remove entire lobe . This surgery call segmentectomy . Compared lobectomy , segmentectomy save large amount healthy lung tissue . With advance screen technology lung cancer tumour , increase amount small lung cancer tumour find , demand segmentectomy increase . A segmentectomy hard surgery perform robotically difficult view tissue line separate segment within lobe . As result , difficult surgeon see exactly piece tissue remove . Because challenge , many patient robotic surgery lobectomy , even full lobectomy need . Near-Infrared Fluorescence ( NIF ) use indocyanine green ( ICG ) fluorescent dye recent advancement robotic platform robotic surgery . The surgeon view CT scan determine segment tumour locate . Once identify , surgeon isolate segment cut blood supply segment . Then ICG inject vein . It expect entire lung , except isolated segment , remain 'dark ' isolated blood supply , fluoresce , give green hue view da Vinci Firefly camera . The surgeon identify 'dark ' segment , remove . A pathologist examine excise tissue ensure tumour remove entirety . Once confirm , surgeon end procedure . If pathologist determines segment remove contain entire tumour , surgeon perform routine lobectomy . This ensure patient safety confirm participant entire tumour remove lung .</brief_summary>
