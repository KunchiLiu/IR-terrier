	<brief_title>A Safety Immune Study 2 Types GlaxoSmithKline 's Varicella Vaccines Given 2-doses Course Healthy Children 12-23 Months Age .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>GSK Biologicals remove human serum albumin ( stabilizer ) varicella vaccine minimize much possible use animal human-derived product production vaccine . The study intend provide information safety immunogenicity GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) Biologicals ' candidate varicella vaccine formulate without human serum albumin ( HSA ) contrast Varilrix™ ( GSK ) contain HSA use two-dose schedule , first second dos give approximately 42 day apart second year life . The immunogenicity sub-cohort comprise approximately 400 subject , represent approximately 100 subject enrol participate country . Rationale amendment 1 : Sites UK perform home visit . For subject participate home visit , subject 's parent ( ) / Legally Acceptable Representative ( ) [ LAR ( ) ] request sign Recruitment/Randomisation agreement provide personal information agree child randomise provide write consent participate study ( provide 1st home visit ) .</detailed_description>
