	<brief_title>Latin American Pulmonary Hypertension Registry</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction . Pulmonary hypertension ( PH ) worldwide group vascular disease characterize progressive increase pulmonary vascular resistance pulmonary arterial pressure secondary vascular right ventricular ( RV ) remodeling , RV dysfunction , heart failure syndrome , finally , premature death . In developed country significant medical advance occur last two decade include systematic assessment availability new therapeutic approach . In addition , current registry show new data regard epidemiology , demography , clinical presentation , treatment prognosis . However , evidence come develop country scarce information necessary identify current care population . In hand , high quality clinical registry may help understand knowledge come clinical trial properly apply result reproducible day-to-day clinical practice . The result REMEHIP , registry one-year enrollment four-year follow-up hopefully broad investigator knowledge clinical profile , medical care , therapeutic trend outcome Mexican population well characterize PH . Data collection set current practice relation epidemiology , diagnostics treatment PH Latin-American , also set mark future investigation . RELAHP property Department Pulmonary Circulation Latin American Thoracic Association ( ALAT ) participate doctor member department . The registry sponsor ALAT additional funding multiple sponsor ( Bayer Health Care , Actelion/Biotoscana , Grupo Ferrer ) . RELAHPÂ´s main objective shed light epidemiologic characteristic clinical presentation patient present PH Latin America , thus help know population evolution , gather information , collect main center work PH region , uniform database . The data allow establish proper strategy early detection disease rational , therapeutic approach . Patients newly diagnose PH confirm right heart catheterization eligible inclusion registry . This registry provide predetermine appointment system ; instead , patient 's treat doctor - accord patient need - shall determine frequency visit . Nevertheless , record condition patient evolution must actualize every six month . Variables include . In patient : ) date onset symptom , b ) medical history , c ) treatment enrollment , ) physical examination , ) WHO function class , e ) six-minute walk distance , f ) ECG , g ) chest x-ray , h ) echocardiogram , ) pulmonary function test , j ) V/Q lung scan pulmonary angiography , and/or pulmonary angiotomography k ) right heart catheterization , whenever possible indicated acute vasodilator challenge l ) Laboratory test ) in-hospital follow - outcome , p ) MACE q ) Diagnostic classification l ) Treatment intervention ) drug therapy , n ) surgical intervention . Visit office . Data collect first outcome update follow-up expect PH symptom , functional class ( WHO ) , current treatment , dose , compliance , collateral effect concomitant medication , weight , blood pressure , heart respiratory rate , biomarkers , record visit . Visits accord standard health care center , general make least one every six month . Quality Criteria . Following criterion use improve quality data : ) standardize definition , data report ; b ) tool fast feedback ; c ) meeting among principal investigator steer committee , least one per year ; ) ethic procedure review ; e ) electronic , simple accessible data collection ; f ) rigorous center selection base investigator expertise and/or facility resource ) ; g ) consecutive patient enrollment obtain representative sample ; h ) random center audit ; ) centralize data statistical analysis ; j ) report data consistent conclusion ; k ) transparency fund publication . Furthermore , quality registry also measure number publication presentation national international meeting previously do . Statistics . Quantitative baseline continuous variable express percentage , mean , standard deviation , odds ratio CI . Differences two group examine Student 's test multiple comparison analysis variance nonparametric test . To analyze variable X2 use Fisher 's test . Cox proportional risk multivariate model ass relationship variable . Structure RELAHP : Executive committee , Single Data Centers ( PH center ) , Data Control Group Publishing Group . RELAHP multicenter project doctor sole owner data individual PH center , consolidated result , anonymous , property ALAT , thus keep patient confidentiality privacy safe . As 2014 , total 12 center ( expand ) contribute data registry plan five-year study period .</detailed_description>
