	<brief_summary>Lung cancer lead cause cancer death worldwide . However , diagnose early stage ( tumor &lt; 2 cm ) , lung cancer highly curable 5-year survival rate great 80 % surgical resection . Screening test make easy identify small lung tumor . However , tumor often visible naked eye , surgeon feel , make difficult precisely locate remove . For reason , surgeon become reliant image guide surgery removal tumor . The standard care locate remove small lung tumor microcoil-guided video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery ( VATS ) . This two-step procedure perform two separate physician . - First , patient take radiology suite radiologist insert microcoil near lung tumor - Second ( usually occur hour later ) , patient take operating room ; surgeon use x-ray arm find microcoil within lung remove surgically . A pathologist review resect tissue make sure tumor microcoil remove . Until evaluation , surgeon know whether tumor remove . While method safe , time consuming , use staff resource , require bulky equipment complete . In study , plan develop test new method identify remove small lung tumor . This procedure call Electromagnetic Navigational Bronchoscopy ( ENB ) Robotic Indocyanine Green Guided Surgery ( RIGGS ) ENB-RIGGS short name . The purpose study test safety reliability ENB-RIGGS surgery form pilot study . ENB-RIGGS surgery do operating room surgeon general anesthetic . ENB-RIGGS begin create 3-D GPS map lung guide surgeon directly tumor . A fluorescent green dye call indocyanine green inject tumor , view special robotic camera tumour fluoresce green hue allow surgeon easily see tumour . The surgeon use robot remove tumor surround tissue . The lung tissue specimen evaluate immediately pathologist .</brief_summary>
