	<brief_summary>Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome major cause morbidity mortality abdominal aortic aneurysm ( AAA ) surgery . It postulate aortic cross-clamping open AAA repair may cause ischemia-reperfusion ( I/R ) lead systemic release reactive oxygen specie ( ROS ) inflammatory cytokine damage distant organ , include heart , kidney , lung . Ischemic preconditioning , first describe cardiac surgery , mechanism whereby tissue expose brief period nonlethal I/R develop resistance subsequent ischemic insult . Remote ischemic preconditioning ( RIPC ) , phenomenon whereby brief period ischemia follow reperfusion one organ ( usually skeletal muscle ) provide systemic protection prolong ischemia . The mechanisms RIPC confer organ protection remain unclear . The hypothesis limb RIPC would reduce systemic inflammatory mediator produce ischemia-reperfusion thereby protect remote organ . A single-center , prospective , randomize , parallel-group control trial conduct patient undergo elective open infrarenal AAA repair . Written inform consent obtain participant . The study protocol review approve Research Ethics Committee Rouen , France . Patients divide two group : sham-operated control group underwent surgery without RIPC RIPC group : Two cycle intermittent crossclamping common iliac artery ( right left ) 10 minute ischemia follow 10 minute reperfusion serve RIPC stimulus , prolong ischemia . Blood sample collect analysis follow time point : surgery ( baseline ) , 1 , 3 24 h cross-clamp release ( reperfusion ) . The systemic inflammatory response measure use serum concentration TNF-alpha , IL 1 , 4 , 6 , 10 . Cardiac , renal pulmonary function evaluate usual biological marker clinical monitor 28 day surgery . Aortic surgery perfect clinical model ischemia-reperfusion make possible study impact RIPC human . This biological approach would help good understand mechanism underlie technique .</brief_summary>
