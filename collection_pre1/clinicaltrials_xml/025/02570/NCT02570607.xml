	<detailed_description>The morbidity mortality non-cardiac major surgery mainly due cardiovascular complication . BNP hormone predict preoperatively occurrence complication . Widely used cardiac surgery , routinely use non-cardiac major surgery . His interest type surgery yet proven numerous study . In practice , problem biomarker pratitioner know opportune moment preoperative dose threshold use classify patient patient risk cardiovascular complication risk . Indeed , recent literature review use highlight fact exist study subject use method BNP assay device heterogeneous preoperative dosing different time even BNP exactly specify . It thus appear many different level BNP . Practitioners know dose BNP threshold base . The purpose study determine best time dose preoperative BNP specific threshold associate allow practitioner ass accurately post operative cardiovascular risk patient possibly offer strategy take different load . The BNP dose anesthetic consultation day surgery immediate preoperative operating room . Post-operative cardiovascular complication collect hospitalization patient telephone contact 28th day , 90th day 6th postoperative month . The investigator establish threshold BNP informative sample time compare determine discriminate dosage thus appropriate time determination BNP . There immediate benefit patient study help future , adapt management perioperative patient depend value pre immediate operative BNP reduce postoperative complication .</detailed_description>
