	<detailed_description>Clostridium difficile infection ( CDI ) lead cause hospital-associated gastrointestinal illness , associate significant morbidity mortality high burden health-care system . The incidence CDI increase epidemic proportion worldwide past decade . Community-acquired CDI , elderly hospitalize patient receive antibiotic main group risk develop CDI 1 . Currently , first-line treatment C. difficile-associated diarrhea include cessation antibiotic implicate development CDI , treatment metronidazole vancomycin recently Fidaxomicin yet available Hong Kong2 . However , disease recurrence increase problem 20 % 60 % patient experience least one recurrence within week completion antibiotic treatment . Moreover , increase number patient require life-saving emergency colectomy experience persistent CDI surgery . Until recently , effective treatment recurrent CDI available . Generally , repeat extended course vancomycin prescribed3 . Fecal microbiota transplantation ( FMT ) define infusion feces healthy donor affect subject attract great interest recent year recommend effective therapy CDI respond standard therapy 4 . Systematic review prospective trial , case series one randomize control trial show overall cure rate close 100 % 5 , 6 . More 50 % patient state would FMT prefer first treatment option CDI recur 7 . While FMT proven effective refractory CDI , role FMT first-line therapy subset patient severe CDI , high risk feature severe CDI study . These generally patient risk colectomy mortality exceedingly high . In addition , mechanism FMT CDI completely clear , limited data available effect FMT microbiota post FMT . It suggest CDI result deficiencies fecal flora composition , particularly Bacteroides Firmicutes , deficiencies microbiota facilitate colonization C. difficile . Microarray analysis small number subject show major shift patient ' microbiota donor-feces infusion toward donors8 . The experimental tool require depth analysis intestinal microbiota become available . This study aim investigate efficacy FMT first line therapy patient moderate severe CDI ass change fecal microbiota FMT use pyrosequencing technique .</detailed_description>
