	<brief_summary>IMCgp100-102 Phase I study weekly intra-patient escalation dose regimen IMCgp100 single agent patient metastatic uveal melanoma ( mUM ) . According regimen , patient trial receive 2 weekly dos IMCgp100 dose level identify weekly recommend Phase II dose ( RP2D-QW ) dose escalation commence third weekly dose C1D15 . The Phase I test intra-patient escalation dose regimen design achieve high exposure maximal plasma concentration IMCgp100 dose Cycle 1 Day 15 ( C1D15 ) thereafter .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Intra-Patient Escalation Dosing Regimen With IMCgp100 Patients With Advanced Uveal Melanoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase I clinical study IMCgp100 patient advance melanoma . In Phase I FIH study IMCgp100 advance melanoma , dose escalation conduct IMCgp100 administer weekly basis ( Middleton , 2015 ) . In study , MTD IMCgp100 administer weekly basis declare 600 ng/kg . With data cut 18 August 2015 , observe DLT grade 3 ( n=3 ) grade 4 ( n=1 ) hypotension weekly dose cohort observe first dose trial . Based observed safety PK profile , flat dose regimen implement across program RP2D RP2D-QW identify 50 mcg QW . In FIH study , several patient metastatic uveal melanoma treat weekly dose regimen MTD dose level ( 600 ng/kg ) well dose level MTD , 900 ng/kg ( n=5 , data cut 18 August 2015 ) . Based review observe objective response Phase I trial UM well objective response note cutaneous melanoma , note patient large diameter disease burden ( cutaneous UM ) experience objective tumor responses high overall exposure IMCgp100 . The intra-patient dose escalation study design base 2 observation clinic : ( 1 ) objective partial minor tumor responses patient higher tumor burden generally observe high absolute dos Phase I trial ( 2 ) occurrence severe toxicity lead dose limitation limit first 2 week dose C1D1 C1D8 . Based 2 observation , hypothesize increased exposure drug week follow occurrence severe toxicity ( first 2 dos ) may lead enhanced tumor response set unfavorable tumor microenvironment UM . This Phase I study IMCgp100 administer weekly basis intra-patient escalation dose regimen . The intra-patient escalation occur third weekly dose Cycle 1 Day 15 ( C1D15 ) . According regimen , patient trial receive 2 weekly dos IMCgp100 dose level identify weekly recommend Phase II dose ( RP2D-QW ) dose escalation commence third weekly dose C1D15 goal achieve long-term dose regimen dose high identified straight weekly dose regimen ( RP2D-QW ) . The dose escalation identify RP2D-IE . The Phase I portion study standard 3+3 dose escalation design . After dose escalation portion complete recommend Phase II dose intra-patient escalation dose regimen ( RP2D-IE ) identify , expansion cohort metastatic uveal melanoma complete . This cohort enroll patient metastatic uveal melanoma prior therapy number approximately 20 patient .</detailed_description>
