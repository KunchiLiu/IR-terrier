	<detailed_description>Study Purpose : The objective early feasibility study assess safety function Aegis Sierra Ligation System ( SLS ) ligating leave atrial appendage patient non-valvular atrial fibrillation risk stroke . The result trial use inform large pivotal trial allow health technology assessment Medical Device License application . General Design : This prospective , single-arm , open-label , multi-center study . This study screen patient atrial fibrillation risk stroke . A minimum 30 patient meet study 's inclusion criterion , none exclusion criterion consent study participation enrol . Patient accruement take place 8 North American center ( A maximum 5 participant 4 US center enrol ) . Each subject undergo follow study visit : Screening , LAA ligation Procedure ( Day 0 ) Post-procedure , Hospital Discharge , Day 7 , Day 30 , Day 90 , Day 180 Day 365 . The total duration participation subject anticipate 5 year post ligation procedure primary safety outcome assess 30-day follow-up secondary endpoint assess Days 30 , 180 365 . Subjects also contact annual telephone follow-up evaluation year 2 5 assess patient-reported long-term Major Adverse Events ( MAE ) current health status .</detailed_description>
