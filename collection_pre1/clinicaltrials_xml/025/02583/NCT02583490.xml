	<brief_summary>This protocol propose pilot randomize clinical trial examine whether Low Pulse Amplitude Focal ECT ( LAP ) favorable cognitive profile compare conventional unilateral ECT similar effect traditional ECT reduce suicidality . The study enroll 10 patient recruit Medical College Georgia ( Georgia Regents University/Augusta University , GRU/AU ) site study . Eligible participant randomly assign ( 1:1 ratio ) receive course either RUL LAP ECT , conventional RUL ECT .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Low Pulse Amplitude Focal ECT ( LAP Study )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Lower amplitude ECT ( LAP ) show induce seizure adequate duration single titration session . This current study hypothesize increase stimulation focality , thus hypothetically minimize cognitive side effect . The central hypothesis LAP significantly less cognitive adverse effect compare conventional Right Unilateral ( RUL ) ECT . The study enroll 10 patient recruit Medical College Georgia . Patients refer ECT service Medical College Georgia usually occur clinical service private physician study recruit patient clinically indicated ECT . Eligible participant randomly assign ( 1:1 ratio ) receive course either RUL LAP ECT , conventional RUL ECT .</detailed_description>
