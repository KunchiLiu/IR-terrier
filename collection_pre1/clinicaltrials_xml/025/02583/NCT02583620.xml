	<brief_summary>Compelling evidence genetic component high myopia put forward several study . Twin cohort , familial linkage study population study describe least 10 loci contain gene involve disease development . The investigator previously demonstrate novel linkage chromosome 7q36 chromosome 7p15 French family . A new approach consist case-control base population association study underway order recover high number myopic subject avoid limitation familial case . 1.8 million polymorphic marker compare emmetropic control order recover locus associate disease population .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Identification Genomic Loci Determining Susceptibility Development High Myopia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Myopia worldwide refractive ocular disorder frequent visual defect man . It responsible major health problem , affect around 25 % western population . High myopia severe form myopic spectrum define increase refractive error beyond -5 dioptre . About 2.5 % general population suffers , secondary complication responsible among patient 4th cause legal blindness . The physiopathology myopia remain unknown mechanism lead disease probably complex , mix acquire environmental genetics factor . Our team previous study gather analysed important series high myopic family : Heritability , segregation linkage analyse model transmission mode localise two major genomic region link high myopia susceptibility chromosome 7q36 chromosome 7p15 . Several loci describe team work topic among different human population . Very recently reappraisal 55 family lead delineation complex segregation model high myopia phenotype thus claim oligo- polygenic mode transmission . Together result express need collect case substitute linkage study association study already conduct order increase power detect involve locus . To find one genomic locus involve high myopia susceptibility ; polygenic model association analysis consider referent method decipher participation multiple , low act locus . High density SNPs/CNVs DNA marker cover whole genome use genotyping . Phenotypes include ophthalmologic evaluation , ethno-geographic origin familial data collect order allow stratification clustering . Computing statistical power association analysis conduct minimize number false positive association obtain 80 % detection power indicate need 400 high myopic subject 400 control analyse . Collaboration Clinical Investigation Center ( CIC ) Ophthalmology clinic use overcome recruitment problem . DNA extraction genotyping conduct Institut national de la santé et de la recherche ( INSERM-UPS ) unit Toulouse use `` Toulouse 's Génopole '' microarrays genotyping facility .</detailed_description>
