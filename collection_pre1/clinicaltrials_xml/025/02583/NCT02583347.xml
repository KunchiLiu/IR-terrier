	<brief_summary>Sleep disorder common patient chronic kidney disease ( CKD ) . Insomnia report 50 % patient treat hemodialysis compare 12 % control population . Restless leg syndrome ( RLS ) periodic limb movement disorder ( PLM ) describe 30 70 % patient end stage kidney disease ( ESKD ) . Patients CKD also report high prevalence sleep apnoea disorder . Conventional hemodialysis peritoneal dialysis appear improve sleep disorder patient CKD . Nocturnal hemodialysis ( NHD ) recently develop dramatically improve biochemical control uremia patient ESKD . There convince clinical epidemiological evidence NHD provide superior clinical survival outcome compare conventional dialysis . Many center offer NHD patient premier treatment kidney failure live decease kidney transplantation available . Regimens NHD vary center - investigator ' programme NHD patient encourage perform eight hour HD ( utilize VIVIA system ) 2 every 3 night . By , patient receive average five night dialysis per week receive forty hour dialysis treatment . Initial anecdotal experience first programme participant suggest , despite need caution patient asleep , patient sleep much good overall get NHD conventional HD . Furthermore , dramatic improvement restless leg syndrome patient undertake NHD note . The investigator propose prospective study twenty patient commence NHD undergo formal polysomnogram study home prior switch NHD . This follow two overnight polysomnogram study within one month NHD initiation two consecutive night - one perform NHD one dialysis-free night . A two overnight polysomnogram study ( similar condition ) take place six month commence NHD . Participants also complete number survey perceive sleep quality . In study investigator identify impact NHD sleep quality .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Sleep Patterns Patients Performing Nocturnal Home Dialysis Utilising VIVIA System</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Baseline data include detail follow : - Cardiovascular disease define affirmative response history physician diagnose heart failure , myocardial infarction/heart attack previous coronary artery bypass/angioplasty . - Lung disease base affirmative answer diagnose bronchitis , asthma , emphysema . - Diabetes defined concurrent use insulin oral hypoglycemic agent . - Smoking classify great 20 pack lifetime exposure . - Alcohol measure total number beer , wine spirit beverage consume average week . - Caffeine exposure define use number cup caffeinated coffee , tea soft drink consume per day . The investigator look variety objective subjective measure sleep quality daytime function five different timepoints describe later . Sleep study perform utilising Weinmann Somnolab 2 system . The investigator enter collaboration Respiratory Care Ireland arrange meet participant home install equipment need record analyse data . Sleep study perform 20.00 08.00 . The test investigator perform patient 5 different time-points overnight polysomography , expire carbon monoxide , inductance plethysmography , pulse oximetery tibialis anterior electromyography . All variable record continuously computerise data acquisition system store later analysis . The overnight polysomnography record 2-channel electroencephalography , electro- oculogram , submental electromyogram use surface electrode . Airflow detect monitoring expire carbon monoxide nose mouth nasal cannulae connect carbon dioxide detector . Respiratory effort monitor inductance plethysmography transducer place around chest abdomen . Arterial oxygen saturation monitor pulse oximetery . Leg movement monitor record tibialis anterior electromyography leg use surface electrode . Means five study compare use Students T test mean study compare one way analysis variance ( ANOVA ) Bonferroni test determine significant difference . Correlation variable determine univariate regression analysis . Data analysis score carry experienced sleep scientist blind clinical characteristic time study . Sleep study score accord guideline develop Rectschaffen Kales . Arousals identify accord American Sleep Disorders criterion . All polysomograms score manually accord establish criterion experience sleep scientist . An arousal define awaken sleep 3 15 second , evidence simmultaneous alpha activity electroencephalogram , electromyogram activation , eye movement , Apnea define absence airflow 10 second . Hypopnea define reduction amplitude respiratory effort 10 % 50 % sleep baseline level 10 second without associate fall oxygen saturation . Apneas hypopneas classify central chest wall abdomen move synchronously , obstructive move paradoxically , mixed central event terminate 2 3 obstructed breath . The Apnea-hyponea index define number apnea hypopneas per hour sleep . Mean oxygen saturation sleep calculate average high low value 30-second epoch . Periodic leg movement ( PLM ) define 4 consecutive , involuntary leg movement sleep , last 0.5 5.0 second intermovement interval 5 90 second . Each participant ask keep detailed diary sleep schedule two week sleep study . This include record retire bed , fell asleep , get bed , number awakening estimate total sleep time . In addition , diary record consumption alcohol caffeinated beverage . Sleep symptom assess use sleep habit questionnaire 5 point likert scale item , : `` Having trouble fall asleep '' , `` Wake night difficulty get back sleep '' , `` Wake early morning unable get back sleep '' `` take sleep pill medication help sleep '' . Daytime symptoms `` Unrested day '' `` Overly sleepy '' , `` Not enough sleep '' response option Never , Rarely ( 1/month less ) , Sometimes ( 2-4/month ) , Often ( 5 -15/month ) Almost Always ( 16-30/month ) .</detailed_description>
