	<brief_title>Evaluating Safety , Tolerability , Pharmacokinetics Bedaquiline Delamanid , Alone Combination , For Drug-Resistant Pulmonary Tuberculosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Bedaquiline ( BDQ ) delamanid ( DLM ) two newly approve anti-TB drug well tolerate . However , combine effect two drug study . Combining two drug , together anti-TB drug , may improve outcome people MDR-TB . The purpose study evaluate safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics BDQ DLM , alone combination , among participant ( without HIV co-infection ) take multidrug treatment MDR-TB . Researchers specifically evaluate effect drug heart . Participants randomly assign one three arm : participant Arm 1 receive BDQ , participant Arm 2 receive DLM , participant Arm 3 receive BDQ DLM . All participant receive assign study drug 24 week together multidrug background treatment ( MBT ) MDR-TB ( provide study ) . HIV-infected participant also receive dolutegravir , use combination two NRTIs study completion . NRTIs provide study . Participants hospital least first 2 month study , may remain hospital longer . Study visit occur entry , week 8 week study entry , every week week 24 , 8 additional visit week 25 128 . Visits may include physical examination , blood collection , urine collection , sputum sample collection , hair sample collection , chest x-ray , electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , adherence questionnaire .</detailed_description>
