	<brief_title>Role Oxidative Stress Inflammation Type 1 Gaucher Disease ( GD1 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The investigator also examine change blood brain chemical GD1 patient receive oral N-acetylcysteine ( NAC ) , available prescription medication natural product antioxidant anti-inflammatory effect . Any change investigator may find chemical level may improve understand disease could eventually lead good treatment option . This multi-center study approximately 50 people Type 1 Gaucher disease ( GD1 ) healthy volunteer . Healthy volunteer 3 study visit course 3 month . Procedures include review medical history , blood draw visit , MRI scan third visit . GD1 patient 7 study visit course 9 month . Procedures include review medical history , blood draw visit ( multiple draw IV catheter Visit 6 ) , neurological exam , pain fatigue questionnaire , MRI scan ( Visits 3 6 ) . In addition , GD1 patient give oral NAC begin take twice day Visit 3 90 day . All MRI scan do University Minnesota Minneapolis .</detailed_description>
