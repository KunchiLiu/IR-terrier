	<detailed_description>Acute lung injury ( ALI ) follow thoracic surgery remain major source morbidity mortality lung resection . Despite advancement surgical technique perioperative management , incidence postoperative ALI remain remarkable . Risk factor postoperative lung injury evident , include preoperative pulmonary function , type surgical procedure , intraoperative fluid management , one-lung ventilation , ventilator setting . One-lung ventilation ( OLV ) usually require thoracic surgery . OLV also important predictor postoperative ALI . Recent laboratory finding suggest tissue hypoxemia ischemia / reperfusion injury collapse lung OLV major cause lung injury . Exhaled Breath Condensate ( EBC ) , exhalate breath typically collect cool device , contain molecule find airway . EBC analysis potential application lung disease , severity airway inflammation asthmatic patient . Collecting EBC simple non-invasive , contrast bronchoscopy lung biopsy bronchoalveolar lavage . Metabolomics refers systematic scientific study chemical process involve metabolite . This study collect EBC thoracic surgical patient , , OLV . The investigator perform metabolomic analysis aim elucidate biochemical reaction one-lung ventilation pathological mechanism acute lung injury follow thoracic surgery .</detailed_description>
