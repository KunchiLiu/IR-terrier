	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) MGE ( muscadine grape skin extract ) 4 week administration patient metastatic cancer . Secondary Objectives : I . To monitor adverse events/toxicity every 4 week treatment . II . To evaluate change phenolic level ( total component , blood urine ) baseline 4 8 week . III . To evaluate change serum cytokine growth factor baseline 4 8 week MGE . IV . To observe response rate MGE patient metastatic cancer . V. To assess overall progression-free survival patient metastatic cancer receive MGE . VI . To assess global quality life ( Functional Assessment Cancer Therapy-General [ FACT-G ] fatigue ( Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System [ PROMIS ] -fatigue Short Form [ SF ] ) cancer patient take MGE . VII . To assess adherence MGE treatment . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients receive muscadine grape skin extract orally ( PO ) twice daily ( BID ) . Treatment continue 8 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity .
