	<brief_summary>When carry knee replacement operation one goal correct deformity leg ( bowlegged knock kneed ) . The ideal alignment mechanical axis , line centre hip joint centre ankle . This line indicate weight body transmit ground via leg . Often plan knee replacement use Xray show hip , knee ankle ( HKA Xray ) mechanical axis drawn . However , weight body go ground ankle heel . There report recently suggest deformity heel influence overall leg alignment knee replacementÍ¾ may affect successful surgery , long knee replacement last . Therefore may make sense take alignment leg include heel planning knee replacement . The conventional practice ass alignment heel hindfoot alignment view ( HAV ) Xray . This show foot . Having two separate Xrays mean radiation exposure make link two alignment difficult . We propose single novel Xray extend HKA Xray show hip , knee , ankle heel ( HKAH Xray ) enable measurement alignment . This study validate hindfoot alignment see novel Xray standard HAV . Patients undergo knee replacement enrol . Patients HKAH HAV Xray surgery . The alignment heel measure HKAH Xray compare standard HAV see accurate .</brief_summary>

The HKAH radiograph take instead standard care HKA radiograph HAV additional standard care . Each participant receive information sheet along outpatient appointment letter dispatch approximately week advance appointment date . This carry information study , risk ( one additional radiograph ) . Participants go knee replacement write &amp; inform consent take part study . If agree additional radiograph surgery .
