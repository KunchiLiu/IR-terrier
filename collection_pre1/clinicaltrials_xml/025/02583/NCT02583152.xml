	<brief_summary>Mucopolysaccharidoses ( MPS ) currently treat Enzyme replacement therapy Bone Marrow Transplantation ( BMT ) . No current evidence effectiveness therapy eye systemic disease avalible . Using new image technique ; previously subjective data quantify compare determine improvment vision patient MPS .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The mucopolysaccharidoses ( MPS ) group hereditary disorder arise defect enzymes break glycosaminoglycans ( GAGs ) occur wide variety tissue , result multiple systemic complication . Sight loss occur MPS due corneal clouding , retinal degeneration , glaucoma damage optic nerve . Corneal opacification occur infancy several MPS subtypes untreated disease opacification think progressive , contribute significant visual impairment many patient . Improvements quality life lifespan result early treatment ( enzyme replacement therapy haematopoetic stem cell transplantation ) meant management ocular complication preservation vision increase importance . A repeatable , reliable technique quantification corneal cloud allow objective demonstration effect treatment ERT stabilisation improvement corneal clouding , establish natural history corneal opacification MPS . The investigator previously develop Iris camera ( Irisguard Corp , McLean , VA 22102 , USA ) technology give objective measure corneal clouding ( Irisguard model IGAD100 ® ) ( Aslam et al 2009 ) . The investigator demonstrate use iris camera corneal opacification assessment MPS feasibile , practical show evidence validity reliability ( Aslam et al 2012 ) ( research fund part Biomarin Europe Ltd ) . The densitometry program Pentacam® Scheimpflug camera also show able provide measurement corneal cloud MPS .This research proposal allow u use technique quantify corneal clouding time MPS patient assess effect treatment ERT HSCT corneal opacification .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Adult paediatric participant MPS corneal opacification potentially eligible study , include untreated , treat previous haematopetic stem cell transplant , treat ERT . Participants confirm diagnosis mucopolysaccharosisis type I ( Hurler , Hurler/Scheie Scheie ) , MPS type II ( Hunter ) , type III ( Sanfilippo ) type IV ( Morquio ) type VI ( MaroteauxLamy ) , type VII ( Sly ) potentially eligible . In order cooperate examination , participant need able hold relatively still seat instrument head rest hold fixation several second reason participant age 3 year eligible .
