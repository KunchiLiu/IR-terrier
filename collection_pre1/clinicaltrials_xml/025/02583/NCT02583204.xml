	<brief_title>Taxane Chemotherapy Nail Toxicity Women With Breast Cancer ; Stage Two : Evaluation Interventions</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This protocol outline proposal investigate whether use dark-coloured nail polish OnicoLife nail drop , compare standard care , commencement taxane base chemotherapy three month completion , effective prevent minimise chemotherapy-induced nail problem . In UK , taxane base chemotherapy use within neo-adjuvant , adjuvant metastatic setting . Taxotere ( docetaxel ) provide neo-adjuvant adjuvant setting every three week , taxol ( paclitaxel ) taxotere provide metastatic setting either weekly three weekly . Taxane base chemotherapy Taxotere show improve progression-free , disease free overall survival metastatic setting . TACT , large phase III adjuvant , open-label randomise control trial sequential taxotere follow anthracycline chemotherapy show overall gain addition Docetaxel standard anthracycline chemotherapy . There many common side effect associate chemotherapy nausea vomiting , alopecia neutropenia correct management , generally tolerate . There evidence taxane chemotherapy improve clinical response reduce troublesome side effect nausea vomit , also demonstrate result nail toxicity/ change AC ( adriamycin-cyclophosamide ) therapy ( 92 % versus 32 % respectively ) . It suggest nail problem associate chemotherapy report term incidence severity . Evidence chemotherapy-induced nail change find study involve randomisation taxane non-taxane-containing regimen /or combination therapy . Case study report oncology journal also highlight nail toxicity abnormality follow treatment taxane therapy associate challenge continuation therapy breast cancer patient lung cancer . Nail toxicity occur hand and/ foot , may vary appearance , severity function . Reported problem vary pigmentation , discolouration , thin ridge nails Beau 's line , Mee 's line , oncycholysis , sub-ungual hyperkeratosis , acute paronchyia , sub-ungual haemorrhage , loss nail plate . These think cause direct effect nail drug hypothesise effect mediate drug stabilise chemical . There evidence taxanes appear stimulate matrix melanocyte , author suggest independent ACTH ( adrenocorticotropic hormone ) , MSH4 ( MutS protein homolog 4 ) , UV ( ultraviolet ) light . Others suggest taxane-induced thrombocytopenia vascular abnormality precursor sub-ungual haematoma haemorrhagic onycholysis . Nail change may appear temporal relationship drug intake vary depending structure nail affect . Nail toxicity relate chemotherapy significantly higher weekly compare 3-weekly regimen . In one study , frequent severe toxic effect occur dose-dense regimen standard TEC5 regimen , grade 3-4 nail change occur 73 % patient receive EC-T6 therapy . Fifty-eight percent cancer patient treat EGFRI develop nail abnormality , typically 6-8 week treatment , include paronychia . Cumulative dose chemotherapy appear significant incidence nail toxicity , median cumulative dose anthracycline doxorubicin , report 22.5 mg/m² mean cumulative dose taxane docetaxel 810 mg/m² . Most cutaneous/ nail change tendency develop number treatment cycle , typically cycle 4 occur early first cycle second cycle . In one study , 75 % patient develop grade 2 nail change , 68 % receive 4 cycle treatment . Concomitant , rather sequential treatment docetaxel associate nail change . Most nail change occur study tend grade 1-2 , study much grade 3 grade 4 . Certain combination chemotherapy drug also associate severe nail destruction others docetaxel transtuzumab dose-dense docetaxel follow dose dense doxorubicin / cyclophosphamide . Not surprisingly , nail toxicity may impact patient 's quality life , particularly female may affect body image , pain , function , wide impact individual 's normal daily activity . In one study , two-thirds sample develop change ( 86.8 % ) significantly limited activity daily live . A retrospective study 425 medical note , base SERIES clinic New York , examine range dermatological toxicity quality life ( QoL ) use Skindex-16 . This tool measure 3 separate domain : symptom , emotional function . The author find 9.2 % incidence nail toxicity , 32 case individual possess 3 different associate dermatological toxicity . These identified patient significantly high symptom , emotional function score less three toxicity . There report nail change resolve time , usually discontinuation completion treatment . However , report partial resolution occur residual nail problem persist . There remain poor understanding pathogenesis nail damage . It demonstrate 20 participant study patient metastatic breast cancer partial response , irrespective severity type nail change ( 50 % grade 1 25 % grade 2 ) . One study describe case study 66 year old male develop grade one , taxane-induced nail problem persist month completion treatment eventually improve time . A case report female develop hyperpigmentation sub-ungual haemorrhage 2 4 cycle docetaxel residual problem 12 month discontinuation treatment , develop fungal paronychia necessitate removal nail . An early case study demonstrate gradual resolution nail condition despite continuation treatment . The finding thus far indicate early recognition imperative alleviate symptom complete treatment . The use filgastrim and/ erythropoietin prophylactically , prior treatment , appear reduce rate febrile neutropenia also reduce nail change increase compliance treatment improvement quality life . In study review , prior trial intervention usual advice patient receive taxane therapy use nail hardener first sign nail weakness , keep nail dirt-free , use nail polish , avoid oil bath wear glove household task involve soak hand water . Others suggest nail change individual receive taxanes anthracyclines may precipitate sunlight UV exposure . It report one patient weekly paclitaxel intra-ductal breast cancer develop photo-distributed erythema onycholysis sun exposure affect area report associate photosensitivity condition nine female oncology patient total . Therefore , evidence use nail covering , UV protective , may least provide protection . Patients searched product may help prevent deterioration nail chemotherapy treatment . OnicoLife drop available purchase online anecdotally , patient receive chemotherapy report product reduce soreness , ridge detachment nail bed . The active ingredient product Adelmidrol , semisynthetic derivative azelaic acid analogue anti-inflammatory compound palmitoylethanolamide ( PEA ) , show efficacy local topical treatment pain inflammation . However current evidence base research support use breast cancer patient receive taxane base chemotherapy . Vascular abnormality predispose nail change also consider way manage occurrence use cool intervention . One study use frozen glove reduce nail problem , extend use frozen sock study , significant benefit study . Both study use right hand/ foot intervention leave hand foot control . However , information provide site venous access relation intervention and/or avoidance dominant hand ever consider . The caveat use frozen glove treatment therefore venous access problem , patient able wear glove predetermine period due cold intolerance . Rationale : Nail problem pose substantial problem patient breast cancer undergo chemotherapy term quality life . It difficult challenge health care professional manage provide advice , mainly due lack evidence effective solution . There need look option may potential benefit patient , include toxic-free formulation dark nail polish OnicoLife drop ® appear useful , however , research base evidence support use .</detailed_description>
