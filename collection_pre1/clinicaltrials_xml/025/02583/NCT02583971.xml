	<brief_title>Assessment Thrombotic Status Patients With Atrial Fibrillation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>AF affect 1 4 people lifetime . Although generally think safe heart rhythm disturbance , risk associate AF formation clot ( thrombus ) within heart eject heart contract cause heart attack perhaps devastatingly stroke . The mainstay treatment AF involve thin blood drug warfarin new drug term novel oral anticoagulant . In addition 3 main way treat underlie rhythm disturbance : 1 . Accept irregular heart rhythm simply control heart rate heart rate limit drug beta blocker digoxin addition blood thin medicine . 2 . Restore normal heart rhythm electrical shock term direct current cardioversion ( DCCV ) . This usually temporary measure , indeed 70 % revert AF 12 month . 3 . Attempt permanently restore sinus rhythm atrial fibrillation ablation procedure . The investigator study , use relatively novel bedside test examine effect management strategy thrombotic status participant 's blood . Investigators take blood total 500 participant divided management strategy decide parent team ( i.e . study affect treatment ) . Investigators draw blood participant 5 separate occasion 12 month period . In group undergo DCCV , blood drawn shortly intervention 3 12 month post intervention . In group undergo AF ablation blood drawn 5 occasion - day procedure , 1-2 day post , 3-4 day post , 3-4 month post 12 month post . In group treat standard medical therapy , blood drawn time enrolment study 3 12 month post enrolment . It investigators hypothesis permanent restoration sinus rhythm atrial fibrillation ablation procedure positively affect individual participant 's thrombotic status . There recent publication registry data United States suggest long term rate stroke population follow AF ablation approach population never suffer AF . The investigator believe cause improvement stroke rate follow ablation improvement thrombotic status hope test first time power , prospective study .</detailed_description>
