	<detailed_description>Introduction &amp; Review literature Malignant pleural effusion ( MPE ) arise advanced-stages malignancy frequently herald poor prognosis . Most patient MPE symptomatic . The common symptom exertional dyspnea . Most patient undergo chemotherapy local treatment palliate symptom dyspnea , cough &amp; chest pain , improve quality life . If underlying malignancy chemo sensitive ( e.g. , small-cell carcinoma lung &amp; lymphoma ) , systemic chemotherapy may control pleural effusion.1 However , pleural effusion persist reaccumulates chemotherapy , management refractory MPE include local therapeutic method thoracentesis , pleurodesis , pleurectomy , pleuroperitoneal shunting . Instilling sclerosing agent pleural cavity ( pleurodesis ) common method management MPE . For several year , various agent anti-neoplastics ( e.g. , nitrogen mustard , bleomycin ) , tetracycline derivative , talc , erythromycin , silver nitrate , povidone-iodine injected pleural cavity create pleurodesis . According recent survey , tetracycline derivative ( doxycycline ) prefer agent perform pleurodesis many centers.7 However , intravenous preparation doxycycline freely available also induce severe inflammation pleura result severe chest pain discomfort patient . In previous study investigator ' center , investigator demonstrate equal efficacy iodopovidine comparison talc induce pleural symphysis.8 Also , iodopovidine postulate anti-neoplastic effect hence may help reduce drain output . Apart benefit iodopovidine easily available cost effective . The investigator believe iodopovidone well efficacy doxycycline induce pleurodesis malignant pleural effusion . Study hypothesis In patient malignant pleural effusion , pleurodesis intrapleural instillation iodopovidone well efficacy comparison doxycycline . Methods Study design : This randomize double blind study conduct Department Pulmonary Medicine , PGIMER , Chandigarh . Selection case : A total 100 consecutive patient malignant pleural effusion enrol study . Patients equally randomize undergo pleurodesis , either intrapleural iodopovidone intrapleural doxycycline . A write informed consent take patient participate present study Randomization : Patient randomize 1:1 undergo pleurodesis either instillation intrapleural iodopovidone intrapleural doxycycline . The randomization sequence computer generate . The sequence generate keep sealed opaque envelope open time procedure Procedure : A chest tube ( 24-28 F ) insert fifth intercostal space mid-axillary line , achieve complete drainage effusion and/or complete lung expansion . In case large effusion , drainage spread 24-48 h prevent re-expansion pulmonary oedema . Pleurodesis perform daily drainage output decrease &lt; 150 mL/day chest radiograph demonstrate apposition pleural surface . In case pneumothorax , complete lung expansion absence air leak confirm instillation chemical agent . A chest radiograph perform confirm complete re-expansion . Normal saline solution ( 50 mL ) contain lignocaine ( 2 mg/kg ideal body weight ) infuse chest tube . Simultaneously , tramadol ( 100 mg ) administer intravenously analgesia . After 15 minute pleurodesis perform either instillation doxycycline iodopovidone . Doxycycline : 500 mg doxycycline dissolve 50 ml normal saline . The combination instill chest tube pleural cavity chest tube drain clamp 4 hour . Iodopovidone : 20 ml 10 % betadine ( Microshield , Johnson Johnson , Solan , India ) dissolve 80 mL normal saline . The combination instill chest tube pleural cavity chest tube drain clamp 4 hour . The chest tube flush 50 mL normal saline instillation study drug ( doxycycline iodopovidone ) . Endpoint : The chest tube remove drainage output le 100mL pleural fluid complete lung re-expansion residual pneumothorax chest radiograph . Pulse , blood pressure , respiratory rate temperature measure every 30 minute procedure 6 hour . Chest pain pleurodesis record visual analogue scale ( VAS ) 0-100 mm . Patients give additional intravenous tramadol ( 50 mg ) as-needed basis procedure . Any complication related procedure record . Complications hypotension , fever , acute respiratory failure empyema note . Patients follow 1 week , 1 , 3 6 month .</detailed_description>
