	<detailed_description>This prospective case-control study fetuses normal pregnancy compare fetus IUGR . Parents ask participate study connection routine ultrasound examination department obstetrics refer suspected IUGR . The control group randomly select among pregnant woman come routine ultrasound pregnancy gestational week 18-20 . Surveys perform third trimester delivery . During ultrasound examination standardize , move sequence heart save . Analyses perform off-line analysed vector velocity image software . With technique , investigator quantify chamber wall myocardial movement . Speed ( velocity ) , movement ( displacement ) thickening/deformation ( strain strain rate ) record structure standardized manner . When perform analysis heart 's wall outline software extract movement different direction . Data obtain concern participate mother previous illness , mother ' age , maternal smoking , BMI , abnormalities pregnancy , number previous pregnancy . Other data record mean delivery abnormalities previous pregnancy , hypertension , preeclampsia pre-natal steroid treatment . Additional data collect participating fetus flow profile umbilical artery , ductus venosus middle cerebral artery . Abdominal circumference estimate weight register . Following delivery , participate child 's height , weight , head circumference gestational age birth register . Additional data collect delivery umbilical vein umbilical artery acid base value , Apgar score . If admit pediatric ward investigator register number day hospitalize ward post-natal care diagnosis . The investigator plan examine participate baby cardiac ultrasound 12 72 hour delivery participate child 3-4 month old 7 year age . The investigator take blood sample umbilical cord birth 7 year age . The investigator analyse blood growth factor cardiac marker . An additional ethical approval accept 2015 analyse epigenetic factor participate child 's DNA . Based power calculation investigator plan examine 20-30 fetus IUGR 40-60 healthy fetus control group .</detailed_description>
