	<detailed_description>16 participant enrol study ( 8 female , 8 male ) age 18-25 year . In order participant qualify study , wear pedometer week study begin determine eligibility . Each participant come lab oral glucose tolerance test morning , follow three night sleep deprive , another morning three night ' sufficient sleep . The sequence oral glucose tolerance test randomly assign . The sleep duration participant monitor reading sleep monitor participant wore . The oral glucose tolerance test perform overnight fast . A 20-gauge polyethylene catheter place antecubital vein blood sample . Blood sample draw ( 0 min ) 4 time ( 30 , 60 , 90 , 120 min ) 75g glucose drink consume determination plasma glucose , insulin , concentration factor .
