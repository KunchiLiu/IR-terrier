	<brief_title>Randomized Controlled Trial Meaning-Making Intervention ( MMi ) In Newly Diagnosed Advanced Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : Psychosocial intervention effective type cancer prevent address distress enhance quality life . However , neglect existential issue . Issues mean meaninglessness especially important existential concern advance cancer patient crucial determine quality life . Adaptation promote current and/or future existential crisis curtail early , psychologically growth-promoting intervention Meaning-Making intervention ( MMi ) ( Lee , 2006 ) , help patient adapt quickly fully , prepare stormy period ahead end life . However , know whether : 1 ) MMi help patient newly diagnose advanced cancer ; 2 ) increase sense mean life ; 3 ) impact last beyond end intervention ; 4 ) effect show due MMi similar effect could obtain someone listen empathically amount time take administer MMi . The investigator want test efficacy full 3-arm randomize control trial newly diagnose advanced cancer patient . They roll feasibility pilot study data ( n=60 ) since demonstrate initial protocol feasible investigator therefore view analyze outcome data ( view research coordinator ) design stay ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier : NCT01693991 ) . . Primary Hypothesis : Adding MMi usual care ( experimental group ) enhance mean life FACIT-Sp-12 meaning subscale among newly diagnose advanced cancer patient , compare receive usual care plus meeting empathic non-professional visitor ( i.e. , attention-control group ) usual care alone , 2 month post-randomization . `` Meaning life '' ( primary outcome ) define belief one 's life significance purpose ( i.e. , global meaning ) `` newly diagnose advanced cancer patient '' define 6 month first occurrence , progression , recurrence stage III IV cancer . Secondary hypothesis : The Experimental Group decrease anxiety depression ( Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale ) , increase overall quality life ( McGill Quality Life Questionnaire ( MQOL ) Total ) , existential wellbeing ( MQOL Existential Wellbeing ) , posttraumatic growth ( Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory ) , compare Attention-Control Usual Care group 2 month post-randomization . Furthermore , MMi effect present 4 6 month post-randomization . Additional analysis : The investigator plan subgroup analysis effect modifier gender , degree baseline perceive life-threat , initial level psychological distress , initial level mean life , degree experience physical wellbeing . Design method : RCT 471 newly diagnose advanced cancer patient assign randomly Experimental Group , Attention-Control , Usual Care . Patients complete self-report questionnaire measure outcomes baseline , 2 , 4 6 month post-randomization . Significance research : Advanced cancer patient confront possibility imminent death consequently struggle search meaning plight . An early , psychologically growth-promoting intervention especially important patient prevent distress within lifespan likely limited . Interventions design promote psychological wellbeing enhance quality life usually fail address important existential dimension pathway improve wellbeing . The MMi offer promise avenue help advance cancer patient adjust diagnosis improve quality life , help adapt quickly fully . If result RCT positive , focus group interview key stakeholder indicate integrate routine cancer care , outreach activity design equip oncology healthcare community address mean existential issue clinical practice .</detailed_description>
