	<brief_summary>This observational study , aim assess physical activity level follow surgical procedure correlate patient recovery length hospital stay , well utility physical activity data postoperative surgical team . Surgical team frequently enquire patient ' physical activity level postoperative ward round . Although information often provide anecdotally nursing staff junior doctor , objective data make available clinician . Such data potential supplement observation ( e.g . heart rate , blood pressure , temperature ) help gain impression patient 's recovery physical status , turn could provide evidence help facilitate early discharge well predict medium longterm outcome . Advances wearable technology allow investigator collect detailed information regard activity minimal disruption . Recent literature show wristworn sensor feasibly wear hospital pre postoperatively , evidence correlation amount step take postoperatively length hospital stay . This study provide evidence usability utility wearable sensor inpatient surgical setting . It provide support evidence surgeon confidently analyse assess patient hospital , allow safe expedient discharge home well identify highrisk patient likely require extra support surveillance community setting .</brief_summary>
