	<brief_summary>Background : - Influenza common viral infection . But deadly people . Researchers want learn body fight virus . They want study people recently infect influenza . They hope help create effective influenza vaccine . Objective : - To learn long-term change body immune system influenza infection . Eligibility : - People complete previous LID Clinical Studies Unit influenza challenge study willing sample store future research . Design : - Eligible participant ask visit clinic every 3 month 2 year . - During visit , participant blood drawn arm vein use needle syringe . - Participants medical history physical exam vital sign perform . This include blood pressure , heart rate , breathe rate , temperature , weight , finger-measured blood oxygen . They answer question medicine take possible recent illness . - If participant symptoms influenza , may sample take nose . A small &lt; TAB &gt; amount salt water spray nostril squeezable container . The salt water run nose container . Or inside nose wipe swab similar Q-tip . - Participants complete health questionnaire month secure website . Participants may also give response telephone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Long-term Observation Hemagglutinin Neuraminidase Inhibition Antibody Titers After Influenza Challenge</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Circulating anti-influenza antibody important factor predict clinical illness severity infect influenza . Specific antibody influenza include protein target hemagglutinin ( HA ) neuraminidase ( NA ) . Lifelong immunity occur influenza , either natural infection vaccination . Due antigenic variation Influenza A , individual may become infected multiple time subtype influenza even strain . In set natural infection vaccination , antibody titer level persist initially , wane time . In previous challenge study , measurement antibody response focus solely acute infection period 2 month initial infection . Long-term change immunity investigate . The challenge set give u unique ability follow individual specific , know well-characterized exposure/illness measure long-term change antibody titer pre-exposure baseline . This study could offer unique insight anti-influenza antibody titer change time naturally response infection life event . This type control study never do believe monitor titer long-term help u good understand protective correlate influenza . In natural history study , follow individual undergone influenza challenge evaluate change anti-influenza antibody titer 2-year period . Subjects follow symptoms influenza-like illness ( ILI ) change clinical status quarterly clinical evaluation blood draw . Monthly questionnaire use follow subject visit .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Completion participation LID Clinical Studies Unit influenza challenge study . 2 . Willing sample store future research . COENROLLMENT GUIDELINES : Participants may coenrolled research study . This addressed casebycase basis approval principal investigator ( PI ) associate investigator . If participant enroll another influenza challenge study , participant remove study . The participant reenroll study completion influenza challenge study follow two year follow completion recent influenza challenge study . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : Any condition event , PI opinion , may substantially increase risk associate study participation compromise study scientific objective . Conditions exclude subject consider unlikely , example would include newly diagnose medical condition may alter participant immune system .</criteria>
