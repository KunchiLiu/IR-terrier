Two main structural bias limit accuracy study : heterogeneity population short follow-up . Perinatal ischemic stroke include several condition differ pathophysiology timing occurrence . Yet , surprising risk factor outcome depend primarily type stroke . Age evaluation also play major role neonatal insult . Even though original lesion static focal perinatal stroke , consequence grow time within mature brain affect field neurodevelopment . The objective AVCnn study delineate determinant , clinical imaging presentation , mechanism , long term outcome category perinatal stroke ( neonatal arterial ischemic stroke : NAIS ) . This lead AVCnn cohort , give u opportunity regularly monitor large cohort child suffer NAIS .</brief_summary>
