	<brief_summary>Background : - Malaria severe infection cause parasite . People get malaria mosquito carry parasite bite . Although malaria occur United States , many people Africa , Asia , South America get malaria . In case , malaria cause death . In 2013 alone , 584,000 people die due malaria . Researchers want find way prevent treat malaria . Objective : - To find combining live , infectious malaria parasite ( know Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge ) two FDA approve drug kill malaria parasite ( pyrimethamine [ PYR ] chloroquine [ CQ ] ) safe provide people protection malaria . The Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge use study without significant side effect . Eligibility : - Healthy people age 18-50 weigh le 170 pound pregnant breastfeed - No history hepatitis B , hepatitis C , HIV infection - Not currently enrol clinical trial involve research drug vaccine - Have travel area high malaria transmission within last 5 year - Never diagnose malaria past Design : - Participants 1 4 group . - Participants receive combination injection drug . What combination receive depend group . This combination injection drug may include : - Injections Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge ( live , infectious malaria parasite ) vein - FDA approve antimalarial drug call chloroquine ( CQ ) - FDA approve antimalarial drug call pyrimethamine ( PYR ) - FDA approve antimalarial drug call Malarone - The study last approximately 3-7 month ( depend group participant ) . - There 68 study visit three group . One group 27 study visit . During study visit , participant may : - Medical history review - Physical exam - Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) : soft electrode place skin . A machine record heart electrical signal evaluate heart function . - Blood urine test - Medication give clinic direct observation - Injection Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge vein - Participants receive diary , thermometer , ruler record body temperature symptom .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge With Pyrimethamine Chemoprophylaxis ( PfSPZ-CVac Approach ) : Phase 1 Trial Determine Safety Protective Efficacy Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge With Concurrent Pyrimethamine Treatment That Inhibits Development Asexual B ...</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Human study show immunization bite PfSPZ-infected mosquito drug coverage chloroquine , approach call chemoprophylaxis sporozoite ( CPS ) , infection treatment vaccination ( ITV ) , chemoprophylaxis vaccination ( CVac ) provide high level , long term protection homologous control human malaria infection ( CHMI ) . The Sanaria PfSPZ-CVac approach duplicate injectable sporozoite ( SPZ ) regimen ( aseptic , purified , cryopreserved SPZ ) . In approach , whether mosquito syringe use SPZ administration , chloroquine use chemoprophylactic agent , transient , limited , asexual erythrocytic stage ( AES ) parasitemia develop . However , exposure liver stage parasite , without parasite complete liver stage development enter blood , thereby reduce potential induce blood stage immunity , likewise show animal study induce protective immunity upon subsequent challenge homologous parasite , indicate transient parasitemia integral inducing protection . To achieve require different partner drug regimen include activity liver stage parasite . Our approach , use PfSPZ-CVac pyrimethamine ( PYR ) , assess human . This phase 1 study investigate safety , tolerability , immunogenicity , protective efficacy follow liver stage parasite exposure direct venous inoculation ( DVI ) aseptic , purify , cryopreserved Plasmodium falciparum ( Pf ) sporozoites ( Sanaria PfSPZ Challenge ) , chloroquine pyrimethamine chemoprophylaxis , induce stage specific sterile protection . By add pyrimethamine chemoprophylaxis chloroquine , liver stage develop kill merozoite release blood stream . The subject thus expose liver stage parasite ( qPCR blood smear negative ) . With strategy , determine protective immunity develop without exposure AES parasites additionally whether minimize clinical symptom associate blood stage exposure . The timing pyrimethamine dose critical ensure efficacy pyrimethamine causal prophylaxis , yet still allow maximal antigenic exposure liver-stage parasites host . An additional potential benefit prevent AES parasitemia elimination immunosuppression associate AES parasitemia . This trial first step establish new regimen PfSPZ-CVac approach , exposure liver stage parasites without subsequent blood stage parasite , assess protection homologous CHMI . In future trial , two-drug regimen assess protection heterologous Pf infection longevity protection . The result study contribute understand target mechanisms immunity Pf malaria infection .</detailed_description>
