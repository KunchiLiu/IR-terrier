	<brief_summary>Background : - Chronic hepatitis D liver disease cause hepatitis D virus . It severe progressive . Most people hepatitis D develop scarring damage liver . There FDA approve drug treat chronic hepatitis D. Researchers want know drug lonafarnib ritonavir help people chronic hepatitis D. Objective : - To find treatment hepatitis D lonafarnib ritonavir safe effective . Eligibility : - People 18 year age old chronic hepatitis D. They must HIV major illness . Design : - Participants screen medical history , physical exam , blood test . - Participants 24 week treatment . They 24 week follow-up . - Participants 1 6 treatment group . Those group receive different dos study drug . Some group start placebo receive treatment 3 month placebo . - Participants also take drug treat hepatitis B . - Participants many visit . These include : - One three-day stay Clinical Center - Physical exam - EKG : small sticky patch put chest , arm , legs trace heart rhythm - Ultrasounds abdomen - Urine blood test - Stool sample - Eye exam - Evaluations reproductive endocrinologist ( woman ) urologist ( men ) . Men may provide sperm sample ( optional ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Treatment Chronic Delta Hepatitis With Lonafarnib Ritonavir</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Chronic delta hepatitis serious form chronic liver disease cause infection hepatitis D virus ( HDV ) , small RNA virus require farnesylation major structural protein ( HDV antigen ) replication . We propose treat 21 adult patient chronic delta hepatitis use combination farnesyltransferase inhibitor ( FTI ) lonafarnib ( LNF ) protease inhibitor ritonavir ( RTV ) . LNF show decrease serum quantitative HDV RNA patient chronic delta hepatitis infection , dose limited side effect . RTV inhibit one cytochrome P-450 system metabolize LNF lead high serum level LNF minimal side effect . In randomized , double-blinded , placebo-controlled study , six group patient ; Group 1 ( 4 patient ) receive LNF/RTV 50/100 mg daily 24 week , Group 2 ( 4 patient ) receive LNF/RTV 75/100mg daily 24 week , Group 3 ( 4 patient ) receive LNF/RTV 100/100mg daily 24 week , Group 4 , 5 6 ( 3 patient group ) initially receive placebo 12 week follow either LNF/RTV 50/100 mg daily ( 3 patient ) LNF/RTV 75/100mg daily ( 3 patient ) LNF/RTV 100/100 mg daily ( 3 patient ) 12 week . After dose , patient monitor 24 week therapy . Nucleos ( ) ide analogue therapy institute study prevent possibility HBV reactivation/flare ; Patients pre-existing nucleos ( ) ide analogue continue patient pre-existing therapy receive either entecavir tenofovir 48 week . Patients quantifiable HDV RNA serum elevate aminotransferase enrol . Before receive therapy , patient evaluate least 3 visit regular test HDV RNA quantitation alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) level undergo Clinical Center admission medical evaluation , time blood draw start therapy . At clinic visit , patient question side effect , symptom quality life , undergo focused physical examination , blood drawn complete blood count , HDV RNA , routine liver test ( include ALT , AST , alkaline phosphatase , direct total bilirubin , albumin ) . At end treatment , patient undergo repeat physical examination , assessment symptom ( use symptom scale questionnaire ) , complete blood count , routine liver test , hepatitis B D viral marker . The primary therapeutic endpoint decline HDV RNA viral titer 2 logs end therapy . The primary safety endpoint ability tolerate drug prescribe dose full course therapy . Several secondary endpoint measure , include side effect , ALT level , maintain virological response , undetectable HDV RNA serum , loss HBsAg symptom . Therapy stop intolerance lonafarnib and/or ritonavir ( carefully define ) . This clinical trial design phase 2a study assess antiviral activity , safety tolerance three different dos lonafarnib ritonavir .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>INCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Age 18 year , male female . 2 . Serum alanine aspartate aminotransferase activity upper limit normal ( ALT great equal 20 AST great equal 20 U/L female ALT great equal 30 AST great equal 30 U/L male ) average three determination take previous 6 month NIH clinical center . The mean three determination define baseline level . 3 . Presence antiHDV serum . 4 . Presence quantifiable HDV RNA serum . EXCLUSION CRITERIA : 1 . Decompensated liver disease , define bilirubin &gt; 4mg/dL , albumin &lt; 3.0 gm/dL , prothrombin time &gt; 2 sec prolong , history bleed esophageal varix , ascites hepatic encephalopathy . Laboratory abnormality think due liver disease may necessarily require exclusion . Patients ALT level great 1000 U/L ( &gt; 25 time ULN ) enrol may follow three determination level . 2 . Pregnancy , active breastfeeding , inability practice adequate contraception , woman childbearing potential spouse woman . Adequate contraception define vasectomy men , tubal ligation woman , use two barrier method condom spermicide combination , birth control pill , intrauterine device , DepoProvera , Norplant . In total , participant partner must utilize two form contraception one method must include barrier method . 3 . Significant systemic major illness liver disease , include , limited , congestive heart failure , renal failure ( eGFR &lt; 50 ml/min ) , organ transplantation , serious psychiatric disease depression ( felt high risk NIH psychiatric consultation service ) , active coronary artery disease . 4 . Systemic immunosuppressive therapy within previous 2 month . 5 . Evidence another form liver disease addition viral hepatitis ( example autoimmune liver disease , primary biliary cirrhosis , primary sclerosing cholangitis , Wilson disease , alcoholic liver disease , nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( steatosis ) , hemochromatosis , alpha1antitrypsin deficiency ) . 6 . Active substance abuse , alcohol , inhale injection drug within previous year . 7 . Evidence hepatocellular carcinoma . 8 . Evidence concurrent hepatitis C infection positive serum HCV RNA . 9 . Any experimental therapy pegylated interferon therapy within 6 month prior enrollment . 10 . Diagnosis malignancy five year prior enrollment exception grant superficial dermatologic malignancy . 11 . Evidence HIV coinfection ; HIV 1/2 viral RNA antigen serum test . 12 . Concurrent usage statin drug inhibits mevalonate synthesis , reduce protein prenylation . 13 . Concurrent usage moderate strong CYP3A inhibitor inducer . 14 . Use prescription , nonprescription natural medicine ( herbal ) medication unless use medication medically necessary appropriate monitoring . 15 . Concurrent usage alpha 1 adrenoreceptor antagonist , antiarrhythmic , pimozide , sildenafil , sedative hypnotic , ergot St. John Wort due possible effect ritonavir hepatic metabolism drug result potentially life threatening side effect . 16 .
