	<brief_summary>The purpose study determine Cyrcadia 's Circadian Biometric Recorder ( CBR™ ) , attach soft biometric patch worn body , improve early breast cancer detection along mammography stand alone device .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Circadian Thermal Sensing Detect Breast Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The Cyrcadia CBR™ ( Circadian Biometric Recorder ) include wearable biometric patch detachable data record device . The CBR™ record chronobiologic data patient totally ambulatory go normal daily routine . Following removal detachable data record device wearable biometric patch , data transfer computer analysis . The Cyrcadia CBR™ place patient duration 2 24 hour . There restriction daily activity . The study subject request sponge bathe rather shower wear device , keep device dry test procedure . After period , CBR™ remove data transfer computer analysis . The primary endpoint 173 patient study determine accuracy Cyrcadia CBR™ supplemental screening device mammography ultrasound predict diagnosis breast cancer . Specific emphasis utilization CBR secondary screening device reduce number biopsy currently perform non-cancerous tissue . A secondary emphasis CBR act improve screening solution mammography specifically patient dense breast parenchymal tissue . Other endpoint study : - determine accuracy Cyrcadia CBR™ , include positive predictive value , negative predictive value , false negative rate false positive rate . - determine optimal wear time Cyrcadia CBR™ . - demonstrate substantial equivalent improve result apply Cyrcadia original patient case study identical advanced neural network analysis computational result . Study subject follow 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month update clinical status .</detailed_description>
