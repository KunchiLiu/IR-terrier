	<brief_title>Visualization Anti-angiogenic Effects With Perfusion Computed Tomography ( CTP )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>So far , CTP provide non-invasive imaging tumor biological response anti-angiogenic vascular target agent number clinical trial increase clinical application . CTP examine variety commercially available CE-certified CT scanner image post-processing possible commercially available CE-certified software different vendor , . In several study , anti-angiogenic effect detect CTP evidence clinical validation proven clinical trial . Changes tumor vasculature measure CTP correlate clinical efficacy parameter progression-free survival , overall survival response rate , thus identify group patient profit anti-angiogenic treatment .</detailed_description>
