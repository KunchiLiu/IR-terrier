	<detailed_description>An open label , single arm , phase II trial Olaparib PDAC patient BRCAness ( BRCA-Breast Cancer susceptibility gene ) . Patients previously identify Loss ATM ( ATM serine/threonine kinase ) IHC OR- Family history BRCA-associated cancer : breast , ovarian , pancreatic , gastric prostate must present 2 first-degree relative OR- Patients previously identify genetic aberration associate HRD eligible [ e.g . somatic BRCA mutation , Fanconi Anemia gene RAD51 ( eukaryote gene ) mutation ] . All patient retrospectively investigate HRD ( Homologous recombination repair deficiency ) signature use transcriptome profiling ATM expression result correlate PARPi ( Polyadenosine 5'diphosphoribose [ poly ( ADP ribose ) ] polymerisation INHIBITOR ) response rate . Eligible patient receive treatment Olaparib tablet p.o 300 mg twice daily progression . Each treatment cycle describe 28 day long . Patients tumor assessment accord RECIST 1.1 ( Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors ) baseline . Patients follow final analysis OS . Eligible patient patient stage IV pancreas cancer previously treat metastatic disease . Patients must receive one prior therapy treatment metastatic disease refuse chemotherapy . Following study entry , patient attend clinic visit every two week first 4 week treatment ( Days 1 15 , ) . Patients attend clinic visit every 4 week whilst study treatment . Patients continue receive study treatment objective radiological disease progression per RECIST assess investigator long investigator 's opinion benefiting treatment meet discontinuation criterion . Following discontinuation study treatment , patient see 30 day post discontinuation evaluation outline study schedule . Patients contact 7 day follow specified date ( data cut-off date ) capture survival status point survival analysis . Patients tumor assessment accord RECIST baseline every 8 week ( ±1week ) 40 week every 12 week ( ±1 week ) relative date enrolment objective radiological disease progression accord modify RECIST criterion . Ongoing collection site review tumor assessment require must record electronic case report form ( eCRF ) . Any patient discontinues study treatment reason objective radiological progression continue undergo schedule objective tumor assessment accord study schedule , order ass objective radiological progression disease . Failure may result bias study result .</detailed_description>
