	<brief_title>Intrapartum Rapid GBS Testing Patients Presenting With Threatened Preterm Labor</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Group B streptococcus ( GBS ) Streptococcus agalactiae gram-positive bacterium colonize 10-40 % maternal gastrointestinal urogenital tract site . Maternal colonization remain primary risk factor lead cause early onset GBS disease infant United States . Transmission GBS neonate early onset GBS case occur time labor delivery , transmission rate 52.5 % intrapartum antibiotic use . Of neonate , 1-2 % term infants 8 % preterm infant develop early onset disease . The Centers Disease Control ( CDC ) recommend universal screen 35-37 week via culture vagina rectum . If perform ≤5 week delivery , sensitivity 85 % negative predictive value 95-98 % . There downside screen remote delivery however ; vaginal GBS colonization fluctuate woman time , thus render possibly inaccurate GBS result . It report least 10 % antenatal GBS negative woman turn positive time labor . This may suggest screen time delivery accurate method predict actual GBS colonization status . In fact , majority neonatal GBS sepsis occur infant born mother negative antepartum screen culture . Currently , standard GBS culture may take 3 day obtain result . A rapid diagnostic test recently study possible method GBS screen - real-time polymerase chain reaction ( RT-PCR ) . Prior study RT-PCR , specifically Cepheid GeneXpert GBS assay use Miller 's Children 's Women 's Hospital , report sensitivity 85-98.5 % specificity 96-99.6 % use data term gestation . The CDC currently permit use RT-PCR rapid screen test unknown status term . Several report demonstrate RT-PCR rapid , sensitive method standard culture determine intrapartum GBS colonization status . Some study also demonstrate ability RT-PCR identify patient would otherwise missed traditional GBS culture . A study Mueller et al demonstrate 64 patient positive RT-PCR result , 10 actually negative culture . A cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrate PCR intrapartum screen strategy less cost-effective traditional culture confers significant decrease early onset GBS disease term gestation . Preterm infant suffer high rate mortality GBS infection , 30 % mortality &lt; 33 week affect GBS sepsis . Identifying GBS colonization thus imperative 7-11 % pregnancy affect preterm labor , give undergone universal screen yet ( typically occur 35-37 week ) . While CDC recommend give antibiotic patient unknown GBS status substantial risk preterm delivery , implementation recommendation poor . Advantages RT-PCR result come back much rapidly standard culture may assist management critical patient , 75 min v 3 day , respectively . Accurate screen GBS rapid fashion , especially preterm infant , risk GBS infection serious , potentially allow antibiotic use appropriately . The investigator seek evaluate utility RT-PCR screening GBS woman risk preterm labor unknown GBS status . The investigator also aim identify ability RT-PCR identify GBS colonization patient would otherwise missed culture .</detailed_description>
