	<brief_summary>The purpose study see whether one dose palliative radiation therapy direct liver combination standard BSC might help reduce liver pain/discomfort due cancer compare get standard BSC alone .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Palliative Radiotherapy Symptomatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma Liver Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard treatment liver cancer pain discomfort like know best supportive care ( BSC ) include pain-relieving medicine call analgesic . This type treatment help case ; however , analgesic require healthy liver work properly . This mean many patient hard time manage liver cancer pain/discomfort BSC alone . Sometimes radiation therapy give `` palliative '' set meaning design treat pain/discomfort necessarily shrink eliminate tumour . Palliative radiation therapy often give patient painful bone tumour , yet widely use treat liver pain/discomfort . Palliative radiation therapy usually give small amount less frequently kinds radiation therapy .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>A diagnosis cancer least one criterion list : Pathologically cytologically proven carcinoma primary site site metastasis ; Pathologically cytologically proven HCC ; HCC diagnose standard image criterion : arterial enhancement delay washout multiphasic computerized tomography ( CT ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) set cirrhosis chronic hepatitis B C without cirrhosis . Largest burden cancer liver confirm CT scan MRI correspond clinically painful area do within 120 day prior randomization . Diffuse ( infiltrative involve &gt; 50 % liver ) , multifocal ( &gt; 10 lesion ) locally advanced cancer ( least one lesion &gt; 10cm , vascular invasion , multiple lesion least one &gt; 6cm ) involve liver . In investigator 's opinion , patient unsuitable refractory standard local regional therapy . For example : HCC unsuitable resection , radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) , transarterial chemo embolization ( TACE ) radical intent , ablative dose stereotactic body radiation therapy ( SBRT ) ; Colorectal carcinoma metastasis unsuitable resection , RFA radical intent , ablative dose SBRT ( e.g . SBRT , &gt; 30 Gy 5 fraction , may option 3 metastasis &lt; 5cm , 5 metastasis &lt; 3 cm ) . Unsuitable , high risk , refractory , standard systemic chemotherapy target therapy ( e.g . sorafenib ) . Patient report moderate severe pain/discomfort prior baseline evaluation pain consider `` stable '' period 7 day prior randomization . Definition moderate pain : Patient report level 46 ( BPI scale 0 10 ) pain discomfort `` bad past 24 hour '' , occur right upper quadrant abdomen , upper abdomen and/or refer right shoulder , attributable liver cancer . Definition severe pain : Patient report level 710 ( BPI scale 0 10 ) pain discomfort `` bad past 24 hour '' , occur right upper quadrant abdomen , upper abdomen and/or refer right shoulder , attributable liver cancer . Definition `` stable '' pain : Patient must show moderate severe `` stable '' pain report score 4 great ( 2 separate day within 7 day period prior randomization ) difference score 0 , 1 , 2 3 . Patient report moderate severe pain ( i.e . pain score 4 high ) . This baseline score must also stable compare recent prebaseline pain score difference score 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 . Blood work obtain within 14 day prior randomization follow : Hemoglobin &gt; 70 g/L ; Platelets &gt; 25 x 10^9/L Absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) &gt; 1.0 x 10^9/L INR &lt; 3 ; Bilirubin &lt; 2.5 UNL ( except subject Gilbert 's Disease eligible despite elevated serum bilirubin level ) AST ALT &lt; 10 x ULN . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status ( PS ) 03 within 14 day Randomization ( see Appendix II ) . Life expectancy &gt; 3 month . 18 year age old time randomization . Patient willing complete PreBaseline Pain/Discomfort Questionnaire Pain/Discomfort Medication Questionnaire English , French validate language ( please contact HE.1 Study Coordinator ) . The baseline assessment must complete within require timeline prior randomization . Unwillingness complete PreBaseline Pain/Discomfort Questionnaire Pain/Discomfort Medication Questionnaire make patient ineligible study . Patient able ( i.e . sufficiently fluent ) willing complete QoL questionnaire English , French language FACTHep available . The baseline assessment must complete within require timeline prior randomization . Inability ( illiteracy language list , loss sight , equivalent reason ) complete questionnaire make patient ineligible study . However , ability unwillingness complete QoL questionnaire make patient ineligible QoL assessment . Patient pregnant , plan become pregnant plan father child next 90 day . Women/men childbearing potential must agree use highly effective contraceptive method . A woman consider `` childbearing potential '' menses time precede 12 consecutive month . In addition routine contraceptive method , `` effective contraception '' also include heterosexual celibacy surgery intend prevent pregnancy ( sideeffect pregnancy prevention ) define hysterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy bilateral tubal ligation , vasectomy/vasectomized partner . However , point previously celibate patient choose become heterosexually active time period use contraceptive measure outline protocol , he/she responsible begin contraceptive measure . Women childbearing potential pregnancy test determine eligibility part PreStudy Evaluation ; may include ultrasound ruleout pregnancy falsepositive suspect . For example , betahuman chorionic gonadotropin high partner vasectomize , may associate tumour production hCG , see cancer . Patient consider eligible ultrasound negative pregnancy Patient consent must appropriately obtain accordance applicable local regulatory requirement . Each patient must sign consent form prior enrolment trial document willingness participate ; Patients must accessible treatment followup . Investigators must ensure patient randomized trial available complete documentation treatment , adverse event , followup . In accordance NCIC CTG policy , protocol treatment begin within 5 work day patient randomization ( earlier prefer ) . Prior radiotherapy upper abdomen would result substantial overlap irradiate volume ( e.g . &gt; 50 % liver receive &gt; 24 Gy 2 Gy equivalent dose ) ; Prior selective internal radiotherapy direct liver hepatic arterial yttrium therapy , time . Cholangitis acute bacterial infection require intravenous antibiotic within 28 day prior study entry . Radiographic evidence intrabiliary cancer within common main branch biliary system , &lt; 4 month prior randomization . ChildPugh score great C10 ( score C10 allow ) . Chemotherapy TACE administer within past 4 week . Targeted therapy ( e.g . Sorafenib ) receive within past 2 week . Plans chemotherapy , target therapy TACE next 4 week .</criteria>
