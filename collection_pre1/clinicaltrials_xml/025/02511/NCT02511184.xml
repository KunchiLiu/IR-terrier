	<brief_title>Crizotinib Plus Pembrolizumab In Alk-Positive Advanced Non Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The patient screen 28 day start treatment determine meet eligibility criterion . The screening procedure include physical examination , blood work radiological scan . In dose finding phase , patient meet eligibility criterion receive crizotinib dose level assign take daily basis pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenous infusion every 3 week . Once Crizotinib dose level decide , dose expansion cohort start enrol patient meet eligibility criterion . All patient follow every three week . Blood sample draw test safety tumor activity radiological scan perform certain timepoints determine antitumor activity . There quality life questionnaire administer certain time point study . The study quality assurance plan address data validation registry procedure . There plan visit investigator site routine monitoring audit . The team conduct source data verification ass accuracy , completeness , representativeness registry data compare data external data source ( e.g. , medical record , paper electronic case report form , interactive voice response system ) . The study also include statistical analysis plan describe analytical principle statistical technique employ order address primary secondary objective study , specify study protocol statistical plan .</detailed_description>
