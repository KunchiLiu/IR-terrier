	<brief_summary>Background : - Parkinson disease disease nervous system affect movement . People usually get 70 80 . Early onset Parkinson disease ( EOPD ) begin age 50 . Researchers think EOPD may cause mutation gene . They want study genetic cause find therapies disease . Objective : - To good understand genetic cause EOPD . Eligibility : - Adults age 18 80 history EOPD . Their family member , Parkinson disease , join control . - Healthy volunteer age 18 80 . Design : - Participants EOPD relative screen review medical record . Healthy volunteer medical history , physical exam , blood drawn . - Relatives may send blood sample NIH test mutation gene link Parkinson disease . They may physical exam . - Participants may ask return clinic another visit last 2 hour . - During visit , participant blood take vein arm via needle stick . - Participants may give sample skin . The skin arm leg numb small skin punch biopsy take special needle . - Some cell blood skin sample may grow lab establish cell line . The cell may also potentially genetically modify make stem cell . - Researchers may perform genetic analysis sample compare EOPD patient sample .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The majority subject degenerative Parkinson 's Disease ( PD ) present 7th 8th decade life . In contrast , neurologic disease present within first 5 decade life . This early onset presentation likely direct genetic cause relative etiology degenerative form disease . Our understanding genetic cause early onset Parkinson 's Disease ( EOPD ) may help u find therapy genetic degenerative illness . Data laboratory others show genetic mutation associate EOPD , disrupt cellular stress-response program . These perturbation , turn , impair cell-repair process , hypothesize increase susceptibility dopaminergic neuron degeneration link EOPD degenerative PD . At time , patient EOPD variable age onset ( span 8 year 41 year subject cohort ) disease penetrance ( severity symptom ) . The hypothesis propose test whether number allele distribution EOPD susceptibility gene mutation account variable age onset disease penetrance . This hypothesis test natural history protocol genotyping subject EOPD define genetic defect explore cellular reparative function individual use peripheral blood cell , skin biopsy derive fibroblast induce pluripotential stem cell derive subject . In parallel , phenotype subject evaluate NINDS Parkinson 's Clinic . Together , data advance insight genotype-phenotype EOPD pathophysiology .</detailed_description>
