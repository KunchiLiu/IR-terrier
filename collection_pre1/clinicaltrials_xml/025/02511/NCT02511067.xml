	<criteria>• Signed informed consent authorization use disclosure protect health information Age ≥18 year Diagnosis diabetes mellitus ( type 1 type 2 ) Serum HbA1c ≥ 5.5 % ≤10 % within 12 month randomization . ( It important certain patient READ4 Study diabetes , suggest macular edema secondary diabetes . The American Diabetes Association suggest HbA1c ≥ 5.5 % may suggest presence diabetes mellitus . ) Have diabetic macular edema ( DME ) central subfield thickness ≥ 310 micron spectral domain optical coherence tomography ( SDOCT ) . Retinal thicken secondary diabetes mellitus involve center fovea ( centeredinvolved macular edema ) . Best correct visual acuity score study eye 20/32 20/400 inclusive ( Snellen equivalent use Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) protocol distance 4 meter ) . If eye eligible , investigator select eye enrol study eye . There specific visual acuity requirement fellow eye time study eye enrollment . However , fellow eye receive ranibizumab , must entry visual acuity 20/32 20/400 inclusive ( Snellen equivalent use Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study ( ETDRS ) protocol distance 4 meter ) time initial treatment . In opinion investigator , decrease vision study eye due foveal thicken diabetic macular edema ( DME ) obvious cause decrease vision . Female childbearing potential must negative serum pregnancy test within 28 day randomization Females childbearing potential may participate trial use reliable mean contraception ( e.g . physical barrier ( patient partner ) , contraceptive pill patch , spermicide barrier , intrauterine device ( IUD ) ) If nonsterile male , commitment use effective contraception ( birth control ) duration study necessary . • Panretinal photocoagulation macular photocoagulation within 90 day prior Day 0 study eye . Presence active proliferative diabetic retinopathy Use intravitreal injection ( include limit anti vascular endothelial growth factor therapy steroid ) within 60 day prior Day 0 study eye . Use Tocilizumab ( IV SC ) within 180 day prior Day 0 . Use intravitreal dexamethasone implant within 120 day ( 4 month ) prior Day 0 study eye . Use intravitreal triamcinolone within 120 day prior Day 0 study eye . Use intravitreal fluocinolone implant within 3 year ( 36 month ) prior Day 0 study eye . Intraocular surgery within 90 day prior Day 0 study eye History vitrectomy study eye Capsulotomy within 30 day prior Day 0 study eye Any plan ocular surgery ( include cataract extraction capsulotomy ) study eye anticipate within first 180 day follow Day 0 ; Pupillary dilation inadequate quality stereoscopic fundus photography study eye ; Media opacity would limit clinical visualization ; Presence form ocular malignancy study eye , include choroidal melanoma History herpetic infection study eye adnexa Presence know active inactive toxoplasmosis either eye Ocular periocular infection either eye Participation investigational drug device clinical trial within 30 day prior Day 0 , plan participate investigational drug device clinical trial within 180 day follow Day 0 . This include ocular nonocular clinical trial . Major surgery ( include joint surgery ) within 8 week prior screen plan major surgery within 6 month follow randomization . Prior treatment celldepleting therapy , include investigational agent approve therapy , example CAMPATH , antiCD4 , antiCD5 , antiCD3 , antiCD19 antiCD20 . Treatment intravenous gamma globulin , plasmapheresis Prosorba column within 6 month baseline . Immunization live/attenuated vaccine within 4 week prior baseline . Any previous treatment tocilizumab . Any previous treatment alkylating agent chlorambucil , total lymphoid irradiation . Concurrent Ocular Conditions Proliferative diabetic retinopathy study eye , exception . Inactive , fibrotic proliferative diabetic retinopathy regress follow panretinal laser photocoagulation Vitreomacular traction epiretinal membrane study eye evident biomicroscopically optical coherence tomography ( OCT ) . Structural damage center macula study eye likely preclude improvement visual acuity follow resolution macular edema , include atrophy retinal pigment epithelium , subretinal fibrosis , laser scar ( ) , macular ischemia , organize hard exudate plaque Ocular disorder study eye may confound interpretation study result , include retinal vascular occlusion , retinal detachment , macular hole , choroidal neovascularization cause ( e.g. , Agerelated macular degeneration ( AMD ) , ocular histoplasmosis , pathologic myopia ) . Concurrent disease study eye could compromise visual acuity require medical surgical intervention first 6month study period Cataract surgery study eye within 3 month study entry ; YttriumAluminumGarnet ( YAG ) laser capsulotomy within 1 month study entry ; intraocular surgery within 3 month precede Day 0 . History vitreoretinal surgery study eye within 3 month study entry Uncontrolled glaucoma ( defined intraocular pressure ≥ 30 mm ) Hg despite treatment antiglaucoma medication ) Systemic Conditions Exclusions General Safety : Uncontrolled diabetes mellitus , evidence glycosylated hemoglobin ( HbA1c ) value &gt; 10 % Blood pressure exceed 180/100 ( sit ) screen period History severe allergic anaphylactic reaction human , humanized murine monoclonal antibody . Have history hypersensitivity ranibizumab component Presence ulcerative wound Evidence serious uncontrolled concomitant cardiovascular , nervous system , pulmonary ( include obstructive pulmonary disease ) , renal ( include dialysis ) , hepatic , endocrine ( include uncontrolled diabetes mellitus ) gastrointestinal disease History diverticulitis , diverticulosis require antibiotic treatment chronic ulcerative low GI disease Crohn 's disease , ulcerative colitis symptomatic low GI condition might predispose perforation . Current active liver disease determine principal investigator Known active current history recurrent bacterial , viral , fungal , mycobacterial infection ( include limit tuberculosis atypical mycobacterial disease , Hepatitis B C , herpes zoster , exclude fungal infection nail bed ) . Any major episode infection require hospitalization treatment IV antibiotic within 4 week screen oral antibiotic within 2 week prior screen . Active Tuberculosis ( TB ) require treatment within previous 3 year . Patients screen latent Tuberculosis ( TB ) , positive , treat follow local practice guideline prior initiate tocilizumab . Patients treat tuberculosis recurrence 3 year permit . Primary secondary immunodeficiency ( history currently active ) Evidence active malignant disease , malignancy diagnose within previous 5 year ( include hematological malignancy solid tumor , except basal squamous cell carcinoma skin carcinoma situ cervix uterus excise cure ) Pregnant woman nurse ( breast feeding ) mother . Patients reproductive potential willing use effective method contraception . History alcohol , drug chemical abuse within 1 year prior screen . Patients lack peripheral venous access . Laboratory Subjects meet follow laboratory criterion screen enrol study unless value normalize . In addition , study subject meet follow criterion course study , investigator consider withhold treatment ( tocilizumab and/or ranibizumab ) particular visit initiate appropriate management , resume treatment study drug subsequent visit laboratory value normalize investigator consider safe resume therapy . INR ≥ 3.0 ( e.g . due current treatment warfarin ) . The use aspirin anticoagulant exclusion Serum creatinine &gt; 1.4 mg/dL ( 124 μmol/L ) female patient &gt; 1.6 mg/dL ( 141 μmol/L ) male patient .
