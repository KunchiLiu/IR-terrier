	<brief_title>Metformin And Longevity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>A potential role metformin prostate cancer suggest give wide availability , tolerable side effect profile safety record may represent therapeutic option men prostate cancer . However , mechanism action metformin exert anti-cancer effect yet fully characterise . This 'window opportunity ' trial provide opportunity investigate compare baseline prostate biopsy post-treatment surgical specimen focus assessment FASN/AMPK axis . Patients newly-diagnosed , early stage , prostate cancer schedule radical prostatectomy either enter main study randomise 1:1 receive metformin ( 2g daily 2 divided dos ; Arm A ) placebo four week prior prostatectomy ( standard care ; Arm B ) . Or subset five patient enter exploratory PET-MRI Substudy . These five patient receive metformin undergo additional two PET-MRI Scans . Prostate tissue ( baseline biopsy post treatment prostatectomy ) use analysis p-AMPK , p-ACC , FASN immunohistochemistry proliferation measure use Ki67 TUNEL metformin placebo group .</detailed_description>
