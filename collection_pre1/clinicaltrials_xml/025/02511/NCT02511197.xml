	<brief_summary>This open-label positron emission tomography/computed tomography ( PET/CT ) study investigate diagnostic performance evaluation efficacy 68Ga-NOTA-PRGD2 lung injury ( LI ) pulmonary fibrosis ( PF ) patient . A single dose nearly 111 MBq 68Ga-NOTA-PRGD2 ( ≤ 40 µg NOTA-PRGD2 ) intravenously injected patient LI/PF . Visual semiquantitative method use assess PET/CT image .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>68Ga-NOTA-PRGD2 PET/CT Patients With Lung Injury Pulmonary Fibrosis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The αvβ3-integrin transmembrane heterodimeric receptor mediate cell-cell cell-extracellular matrix adhesion . The αvβ3-integrin play pivotal role promote sustain angiogenesis fibrosis . Cyclic arginine-glycine-aspartic acid ( RGD ) peptide key integrin recognition motif strongly bind αvβ3-integrin , make RGD-based peptide hold promise image treatment disease characterise angiogenesis fibrosis include LI PF . Animal study bleomycin induce lung fibrosis show good uptake ratio 68Ga-NOTA-PRGD2 lung v background . For interest clinical translation 68Ga-NOTA-PRGD2 , open-label dynamic whole-body PET/CT study design investigate safety diagnostic performance 68Ga-NOTA-PRGD2 patient LI PF .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis Males female , ≥18 year old . Characteristic clinical sign , symptom laboratory test suggest diagnosis LI/PF . The diagnosis IPF base The Centres Disease Control Prevention ( CDC ) criteria diagnose LI/PF . They rely combination clinical , radiological , operative histological finding , addition result laboratory test . Females plan bear child recently childbearing potential . Renal function : serum creatinine &gt; 3.0 mg/dL ( 270 μM/L ) . Liver function : hepatic enzyme level 5 time upper limit normal . Known severe allergy hypersensitivity IV radiographic contrast . Patients able enter bore PET/CT scanner . Inability lie still entire imaging time cough , pain , etc . Inability complete need examination due severe claustrophobia , radiation phobia , etc . Concurrent severe and/or uncontrolled and/or unstable medical disease , opinion investigator , may significantly interfere study compliance .</criteria>
