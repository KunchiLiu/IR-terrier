	<detailed_description>Measurement cardiac output one important hemodynamic monitoring tool cardiac surgery . It help determine type medication need maintain optimal hemodynamic status entire perioperative period . Thermodilution method use pulmonary artery catheter consider gold standard measurement cardiac output , however past 10 15 year question safety efficacy . There surge recent year less invasive device capable measure cardiac output various mean , include bioimpedance , transpulmonary thermodilution , transthoracic transesophageal echocardiography , arterial waveform analysis . There variety device currently available cardiac output measurement arterial-waveform analysis . These device compare , pulmonary artery catheter gold standard . However , company manufacture device make software upgrade believe improve performance . No study perform compare uncalibrated arterial waveform base cardiac output measurement device , LiDCORapid since software upgrade . In addition baseline cardiac output measurement , Investigators intend study effect volume load ( trendelenburg position ) , sympathetic stimulus ( incision ) , vasodilated state ( 15 minute separation CPB ) chest closure cardiac output measure three different technique . In addition cardiac output investigator would like measure stroke volume , Systemic Vascular Resistance , stroke volume variation LiDCO . The main purpose validate accuracy measurement two minimally-invasive method comparison thermodilution method various hemodynamic state .</detailed_description>
