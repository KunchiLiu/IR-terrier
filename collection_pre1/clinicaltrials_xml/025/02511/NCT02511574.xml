	<brief_title>Comparison Between Natural Progesterone Vaginal Pessary Prevention Spontaneous Preterm Birth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Preterm birth lead cause perinatal morbidity mortality . The rate spontaneous premature labor change much past 10 year . A significant decrease mortality morbidity premature baby possible woman risk spontaneous preterm birth accurately identify administer preventive therapy . Ultrasonographic measurement cervix 20 24 week gestation improve identification woman single pregnancy twin pregnancy risk . Asymptomatic woman short uterine cervix ( 25 mm less ) increase risk spontaneous premature labor . The prophylactic use progesterone early phase pregnancy woman history preterm birth short cervix prevent preterm birth . The cervical pessary device use also prevention preterm birth . The omega-3 intake also appear related prevention prematurity . Vaginal infection also important cause preterm birth . There many study vaginal microbiome pregnant woman . Measurement cervical length use screen test inexpensive , short learn curve , well tolerated patient . In addition , placement removal pessary easy , accessible , noninvasive procedure . The result concentration omega 3 preterm birth still conflict . The aim study compare effectiveness cervical pessary natural progesterone reduction preterm birth rate pregnant woman uterine cervix measure 25 mm less length evaluate transvaginal ultrasonography , ass whether relationship maternal plasma concentration omega 3 preterm birth , compare microbiome woman . Methods : A prospective randomized control trial include pregnant woman time morphological ultrasound 20 23 week 6 day pregnancy . Pregnant woman gestational age cervical length 25 mm less randomized conduct inclusion progesterone vaginal pessary . In patient group vaginal discharge sample collect time randomization . In pregnant woman accept participate study ( short cervix ) collect blood sample measurement omega 3 .</detailed_description>
