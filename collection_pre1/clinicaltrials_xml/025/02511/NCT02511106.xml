	<brief_title>AZD9291 Versus Placebo Patients With Stage IB-IIIA Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma , Following Complete Tumour Resection With Without Adjuvant Chemotherapy .</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This phase 3 double-blind , randomize , placebo-controlled , study assess efficacy safety AZD9291 versus placebo patient stage IB-IIIA non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) centrally confirm , common sensitise EGFR mutation ( Ex19Del L858R ) either alone combination EGFR mutation confirm central test , complete tumour resection , without postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy . Adjuvant chemotherapy consist platinum base doublet give maximum 4 cycle .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Male female , age least 18 year . 2 . Histologically confirm diagnosis primary non small lung cancer ( NSCLC ) predominantly nonsquamous histology 3 . MRI CT scan brain must do prior surgery consider standard care . 4 . Patients must classify postoperatively Stage IB , II IIIA basis pathologic criterion . 5 . Confirmation central laboratory tumour harbour one 2 common EGFR mutation know associated EGFRTKI sensitivity ( Ex19del , L858R ) , either alone combination EGFR mutation include T790M . 6 . Complete surgical resection primary NSCLC mandatory . All gross disease must remove end surgery . All surgical margin resection must negative tumour . 7 . Complete recovery surgery standard postoperative therapy ( applicable ) time randomization . 8 . World Health Organization Performance Status 0 1 . 9 . Female patient use adequate contraceptive measure , breast feeding , must negative pregnancy test prior first dose study drug ; female patient must evidence nonchildbearing potential . 1 . Treatment follow : Preoperative postoperative plan radiation therapy current lung cancer Preoperative ( neoadjuvant ) platinum base chemotherapy Any prior anticancer therapy Prior treatment neoadjuvant adjuvant EGFRTKI time Major surgery ( include primary tumour surgery , exclude placement vascular access ) within 4 week first dose study drug Patients currently receive medication herbal supplement know potent inducer cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 3A4 Treatment investigational drug within five halflives compound relate material . 2 . Patients segmentectomies wedge resection 3 . History malignancy , except : adequately treat nonmelanoma skin cancer , curatively treated insitu cancer , solid tumour curatively treat evidence disease &gt; 5 year follow end treatment . 4 . Any unresolved toxicity prior therapy great CTCAE Grade 1 time start study treatment exception alopecia Grade 2 , prior platinumtherapy relate neuropathy . 5 . Any evidence severe uncontrolled systemic disease , include uncontrolled hypertension active bleeding diatheses ; active infection include hepatitis B , hepatitis C human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . 6 . Refractory nausea vomiting , chronic gastrointestinal disease , inability swallow formulate product , previous significant bowel resection would preclude adequate absorption AZD9291 . 7 . Any following cardiac criterion : Mean rest correct QT interval ( QTc ) &gt; 470 msec , obtain 3 ECGs , use screen clinic ECG machinederived QTc value . Any clinically important abnormality rhythm , conduction , morphology rest ECG . Any factor increase risk QTc prolongation risk arrhythmic event , unexplained sudden death 40 year age firstdegree relative concomitant medication know prolong QT interval . 8 . Past medical history ILD , druginduced ILD , radiation pneumonitis require steroid treatment , evidence clinically active ILD . 9 . Inadequate bone marrow reserve organ function .</criteria>
