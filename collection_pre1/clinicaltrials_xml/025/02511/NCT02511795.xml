	<brief_title>AZD1775 Combined With Olaparib Patients With Refractory Solid Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This Phase Ib , multi-centre study AZD1775 combine olaparib administer orally patient refractory solid tumour , first-line sequential combination therapy extensive disease ( ED ) small-cell lung cancer ( SCLC ) . There 3 part study design : Part A : Dose Escalation Part B : Dose Expansion Part C : Expansion first-line ED SCLC In Part A , patient refractory solid tumour assess safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) AZD 1775 combine olaparib . Different dose level administer identify maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) /recommended phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) . The dose expansion part ( Part B ) explore safety , PK , efficacy MTD/RP2D dosing schedule , cohort organize tumour type molecular biomarkers interest follow treatment cohort : Ovarian Cancer - Twenty patient confirm BRCA1 and/or BRCA2 mutation . Patients must exhaust standard treatment option , however must receive prior treatment PARP-inhibitor . - Twenty patient confirm BRCA wild-type status . Patients must exhaust standard treatment option advance disease ( recurrent metastatic ) . Triple Negative Breast Cancer - Patients must previously treat least 1 chemotherapy-containing regimen advance disease ( recurrent metastatic ) . - Approximately 15 biomarker positive ( amplification least one follow gene : CCNE1 , MYC , MYCL , MYCN ) 15 biomarker negative patient treat , potential recruit additional 20 patient . Second-Line Small Cell Lung Cancer - Patients must previously treat one chemotherapy-containing regimen advance disease ( recurrent metastatic ) , relapse least 90 day follow completion treatment . - Approximately 15 biomarker positive ( amplification least one follow gene : CCNE1 , MYC , MYCL , MYCN ) 15 biomarker negative patient treat , potential recruit additional 20 patient . Part C dose expansion arm first-line SCLC patient ED demonstrate objective complete response ( CR ) , partial response ( PR ) stable disease measurable tumour shrinkage follow two cycle Standard Care chemotherapy regimen contain etoposide platinum . The combination AZD 1775 olaparib evaluate first-line sequential combination therapy . An olaparib pharmacokinetic ( PK ) sub-study precede combine treatment AZD1775 olaparib patient . In PK sub-study olaparib take orally BID 3 day venous blood sample collect Day 3 assessment multiple dose pharmacokinetics single agent olaparib . Patients experience short gap treatment ( approximately 4-5 day ) Day 3 olaparib PK sub-study Cycle 1 Day 1 combination treatment . Patients continue receive treatment AZD1775 Olaparib disease progression , intolerable toxicity , discontinuation criterion meet .</detailed_description>
