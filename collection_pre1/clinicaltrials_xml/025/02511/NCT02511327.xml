	<brief_summary>Young infant vulnerable severe disease even death infect Bordetella Pertussis . The current vaccine vaccination program guarantee protection neonate . During last week pregnancy , maternal IgG antibody transfer actively fetus . Administration pertussis contain vaccine pregnancy offer protection high titer maternal antibody transfer child . Since transplacental transport immature , infant bear prior 37 week gestation , might vulnerable pertussis infection even though maternal vaccination administer , specific data lacking . The primary aim observational study measure whether vaccination pregnancy offer protection preterm bear infant high titer maternal antibody , despite immature transplacental transport . Four cohort mother-infant pair recruit : term versus preterm born infant , bear either vaccinated woman vaccinate woman . These mother-infant pair recruit accord vaccination status mother gestational age delivery . Pertussis specific antibody titer ( anti-Pertussis Toxin , anti-Filamentous haemagglutinin , anti-Pertactin titer ) monitor blood sample mother delivery measure possible influence gestational age maternal vaccination status . In order measure decline maternal antibody first week life , blood take cord well infant 8 week age , first infant pertussis vaccine administer . Pertussis antibody antigens measured infant primary series acellular pertussis vaccine administer 8,12 16 week age booster dose second year life . In addition , cellular mediate immune response evaluate subgroup infant primary series infant vaccine . A last goal measure whether vaccination pregnancy could offer additional maternal antibody breast milk . Again comparison make preterm term bear infant , bear either vaccinate unvaccinated woman . The amount lactoferrin pertussis toxin specific IgA breast milk sample measure sample take birth ( colostrum ) , several time point afterwards long breastfeed continue .</brief_summary>
