	<brief_title>Multicenter Study Cryoablation Palliation Painful Bone Metastases</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients painful metastatic lesion involve bone meet eligibility criterion determine appropriate candidate cryoablation therapy offer enrollment study . Patients agree participate read sign inform consent form thus become subject study . Treatment perform use Galil Medical cryoablation system Galil Medical cryoablation needle . Subjects one cryoablation procedure follow 6 month palliation pain , quality life analgesic usage . Baseline follow-up data collect subject via web-based electronic data collection tool .</detailed_description>
