	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine feasibility administration electronic patient-reported outcome functional assessment gastrointestinal ( GI ) cancer surgery ( gastric , colorectal , liver , pancreas ) . II . Determine percentage patient able complete &gt; 80 % MD . Anderson Symptom Inventory ( MDASI ) European Quality LIfe-5 Dimensions ( EQ-5D ) web-based survey . III . Determine percentage patient able wear wristband device least 1 week post-operatively . IV . Determine length time complete web-based survey . V. Determine length time patient able wear wristband device , surgery . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Determine percentage patient enroll study analyze reason . This accomplished use : 1 ) number patient ask participate ; 2 ) number patient decline participate , 3 ) reason decline participation . II . Responses Satisfaction Tool use ass : 1 ) ease use web-based survey wristband device ; 2 ) feedback item web-based survey distress difficult comprehend ; 3 ) feedback length survey time administration ; 4 ) suggestion item cover added . III . Calculate mean number miss item within questionnaire identify individual subset question difficult answer . OUTLINE : Patients complete online survey comprise question quality life , symptom , activity level , wear wristband device ( Vivofit watch ) 3-7 day prior surgery . After go home , patient complete symptom survey three time week quality life survey week 2 week post-surgery . After completion study , patient follow 1 month .</detailed_description>
