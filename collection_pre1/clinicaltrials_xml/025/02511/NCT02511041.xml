	<brief_summary>Background : - A congenital disorder glycosylation ( CDG ) affect cell make organ tissue . In cell , sugar molecule properly attach molecule , basic building block cell . Changes sugar see people CDGs may lead allergy change people ability fight infection . Researchers want see sugar supplement call N-acetylglucosamine help people CDGs detectable change immune system . Objective : - To see N-acetylglucosamine help cell function healthy way people CDGs . Eligibility : - People least 2 year age CDG immune system change . Design : - Participants screen physical exam , medical history , blood test . - One month later , participant repeat blood test screen visit . Blood drawn 2 different day week . - Participants get N-acetylglucosamine supplement instruction take . N-acetylglucosamine powder add food drink . - Participants physical exam blood test every month study . - After take N-acetylglucosamine 4 month , participant blood test . They get N-acetylglucosamine supplement nucleoside supplement . The second supplement may powder tablet may crush add food . Participants take supplement 5 month . - After 10 month study , participant 2 visit week blood test .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Autosomal recessive hypomorphic loss-of-function mutation phosphoglucomutase 3 ( PGM3 ) show result novel congenital disorder glycosylation ( CDG ) present hyper-IgE clinical phenotype . PGM3 require biosynthesis uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine ( UDP-GlcNAc ) , critical building block N- O-linked glycans , essential many immune pathway human . PGM3 deficient patient exhibit reduce UDP-GlcNAc level , well cell specific global defect N- O-linked glycosylation , respectively . Understanding glycosylation defect result atopic diatheses immune dysregulation provide novel insight immunopathogenesis . Developing successful therapy patient may provide novel target approach treatment allergic diseases general population . Patients CDGs show dramatic clinical improvement give oral supplementation mannose fucose . Among patient PGM3 deficiency , vitro supplementation non-diabetogenic amino-sugar N-acetylglucosamine ( GlcNAc ) normalize intracellular UDP-GlcNAc surface CTLA-4 expression . We therefore propose exploratory study provide 50 patient exogenous GlcNAc triacetyluridine objective assess effect immune function change cellular glycosylation pattern . We begin PGM3 patient self-administer sequential , escalate dos oral GlcNAc uridine ( UMP TAU ) . Given preliminary vitro data , hypothesize supplementation provide sufficient substrate promote increase UDP-GlcNAc , restore N- O-linked glycans , improve immune function PGM3 deficient patient . Patients self-administer oral GlcNAc 3 time per day begin 12.5 mg/kg/day increase dose every 2 week . Once maximum tolerate dose find ( less equal 100 mg/kg/day ) , GlcNAc supplementation continue 6 week , point add oral uridine . We titrate uridine find maximum tolerate dose ( less equal 200 mg/kg/day ) continue dual dose additional 12 week . If end time period change absolute lymphocyte count , supplementation stop . The dietary supplement use study low toxicity well-tolerated study patient colitis , galactosemia , Alzheimer , multiple sclerosis , treatment 5-fluorouracil overdose .</detailed_description>
