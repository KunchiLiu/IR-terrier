	<brief_summary>This dose escalation protocol determine feasibility co-administration RRx-001 nivolumab . Immune surveillance endogenous mechanism cause remission neoplastic growth . Epigenetic agent like RRx-001 associate enhanced gene transcription restore expression silence gene also increase expression pro-inflammatory mediator , upregulation PD-L1 tumor cell de-repression antigen promote immune recognition tumor . It hypothesize RRx-001 , prime sensitize immune checkpoint therapy target PD-1 interaction nivolumab .</brief_summary>
