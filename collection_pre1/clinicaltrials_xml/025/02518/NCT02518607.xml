	<detailed_description>Short Title : Safety , blood level effect MGB-BP-3 Trial medication MGB-BP-3 new class antibacterial agent bind selectively bacterial DNA minor groove possess strong bactericidal vitro vivo activity Clostridium difficile ( C. difficile ) . In addition activity C. difficile MGB-BP-3 strong activity Gram-positive bacteria test , include susceptible resistant Staphylococcus aureus , Streptococcus Enterococcus . MGB-BP-3 develop treatment C. difficile infection ( CDI ) . Objectives Primary : To assess safety tolerability single repeat oral dos MGB-BP-3 healthy men Secondary : To assess pharmacokinetics ( PK ) single repeat oral dos MGB-BP-3 healthy men Type trial This trial do 2 part , follow . Part A : Phase I , double-blind , randomise , placebo-controlled , crossover , single ascending-dose trial healthy men . Part B : Phase I , double-blind , randomise , placebo-controlled , sequential-group , repeat ascending-dose trial healthy men . Trial population Total 40 healthy men ( exclude replacement subject ) : 16 subject Part A 24 subject Part B . Age 18-45 year Principal inclusion criterion Normotensive male , body mass index ( BMI ) 18.0-30.9 kg/m2 ; deem healthy basis clinical history , physical examination , electrocardiogram ( ECG ) , vital sign , laboratory test blood urine ; willing use reliable contraception ; able give fully inform write consent . Principal exclusion criterion Positive test hepatitis B &amp; C , HIV ; severe adverse reaction drug ; drug alcohol abuse ; smoke 5 cigarette ( use equivalent tobacco nicotine product ) daily ; over-the-counter medication within previous 7 day ( exception paracetamol ) , prescribe medication previous 28 day ; participation clinical trial unlicensed medicine , loss 400 mL blood , within previous 3 month ; vital sign outside acceptable range ; clinically relevant abnormal finding screen assessment ; acute chronic illness ; clinically relevant abnormal medical history concurrent medical condition ; possibility volunteer cooperate . Trial design method Part A Part A randomise , double-blind , placebo-controlled , cross-over , single ascending-dose trial 16 healthy men . Subjects enrol 2 group 8 ( Groups 1 2 ) . Each subject 3 study session - receive single oral dose MGB-BP-3 3 study session ; 6 volunteer receive match placebo 1 study session . So , dose level , 6 subject randomise receive MGB-BP-3 2 subject randomise receive placebo . There washout period least 4 day dos subject , interval least 6 day last dose Group 1 first dose Group 2 . The investigator sponsor review safety tolerability data dose level increase dose . The dose escalate safety tolerability previous dose level acceptable . The plan dose level may change , base emerge safety tolerability data - dose level may repeat low dose test . The maximum dose test exceed 2000 mg MGB-BP-3 , 2-fold low NOAEL ( observed adverse effect level ) male dog . Because MGB-BP-3 never give human , first dose level stagger : 2 lead subject dosed later day remain subject group dose . The leading subject dose interval least 10 minute , remain subject also intervals least 10 minute . To maintain blind nature study , 1 leading subject randomise receive MGB-BP-3 placebo . Part A consider 'first human ' portion study , GP ( General Practioner ) reply must obtain subject Part A . Subjects screen 4 week first dose trial medication . In 3 study session , subject resident ward day dose ( Day -1 ) , completion procedure 72 h dose trial medication ( Day 4 ) . Subjects attend follow-up visit 7-10 day dose trial medication . Part B Part B randomise , double-blind , placebo-controlled , sequential-group , repeat ascending-dose trial 24 healthy men . The sponsor investigator select 3 dose level test Part B , base available safety tolerability data Part A . The high total daily dose test Part B exceed high dose Part A acceptably tolerate safety concern . Part B start Part A finish , provide total daily dose give ( high dose ) previously show acceptably tolerate safe Part A . Subjects enrol 3 group 8 ( Groups 3-5 ) . Each subject 1 study session , receive twice-daily oral dos MGB-BP-3 , match placebo , 9 day ( Days 1-9 ) single dose morning Day 10 . In group , 6 subject randomise receive MGB-BP-3 2 subject randomise receive placebo . Subjects group dose interval least 10 minute . For ascend dose level , 'll gap least 6 day final dose previous group first dose next group . The investigator sponsor review safety tolerability data dose level increase dose . The dose escalate safety tolerability previous dose level acceptable . The planned dos may change , depend safety tolerability previous dos - dose level may repeat low dose test . Subjects screen within 4 week first dose trial medication . They resident ward admission Day -2 completion procedures 72 h final dose trial medication ( Day 13 ) . They attend follow-up visit 7-10 day final dose trial medication . Methods : Parts A B The following assessment make : Safety : laboratory assessment ( routine haematology , biochemistry urinalysis ) , physical examination , 12-lead ECG , telemetry ( Part A ) faecal occult blood , intestinal permeability ( ratio lactulose mannitol excreted urine , Part B ) , faecal flora ( Part B ) , vital sign , adverse event . Tolerability : adverse event . Pharmacokinetic : blood sample assay MGB-BP-3 possible metabolite take , frequently 48 h dose Part A , 12 h subject ' morning dose Day 1 48 h dose Day 10 Part B . In addition , Part B , blood sample take morning dose Days 2-9 . Urine collect 24 h dose assay MGB-BP-3 Part A , 12 h morning dose Day 1 10 ( Part B ) . Faecal sample collect daily 72 h subject ' ( final ) dose assay MGB-BP-3 study session , Part B 24 h dose Days 1 5 . Primary variable Safety : vital sign , ECG , telemetry ( Part A ) , physical examination , laboratory safety test , faecal occult blood , intestinal permeability ( Part B ) , faecal flora ( Part B ) Tolerability : adverse event Secondary variable Pharmacokinetics : PK parameter MGB-BP-3 : Cmax , tmax appropriate t½ , AUC0-t , AUC0-∞ , Ctrough , AUC 0-τ ( Part B ) , Vd/f ( Part A Vdss/f Part B ) CL/f ( Part A CLss/f Part B ) plasma Ae0-24 ( Part A ) , Ae0-τ ( Part B ) CLr urine The amount MGB-BP-3 excrete faeces .</detailed_description>
