	<detailed_description>The study objective determine whether use high potency statin , compare use low potency statin , associate increase risk incident diabetes follow hospitalisation cardiovascular event procedure . The investigator use common-protocol approach conduct retrospective cohort study use health care data eight jurisdiction ( Canadian province Alberta , Manitoba , Nova Scotia , Ontario , Quebec , Saskatchewan , well United States ( US ) MarketScan United Kingdom ( UK ) Clinical Practice Research Datalink [ CPRD ] ) . The Canadian provincial database contain information physician billing , diagnose procedure hospital discharge abstract , dispensation prescription drug population level . The CPRD clinical database representative UK population contains record patient see 680 general practitioner practice UK ; data link Hospital Episode Statistics ( HES ) database , contain in-hospital diagnosis procedure data . US MarketScan include individual dependent cover large U.S. employer health insurance plan , government public organization . Study population In jurisdiction , investigator assemble study cohort include patient new prescription statin ( hospital discharge ) , include simvastatin , lovastatin , pravastatin , fluvastatin , atorvastatin , rosuvastatin , early availability data site last date available data . The date study cohort entry define prescription date newly-prescribed statin . Patients follow date study cohort entry event ( define ) censor due death , departure database , 24 month initiation statin treatment , dispense cerivastatin , end study period ( 31 March 2011 last date data availability site ) , whichever occur first . Data Alberta , Ontario , Nova Scotia restrict patient age 65 year old prescription data available young patient . Case-control selection The cohort define analyzed use nested case-control analysis , case define hospitalization incident diabetes prescription insulin oral antidiabetic medication . Risk set sample use randomly select 10 control case , match sex , age ( ± two year ; however , control available , within five year ) , cohort entry ( ± 90 day ) . Exposure assessment The exposure category separate statin potency ( high vs. low dose ) , duration current exposure . For case control , exposure define hierarchically ; specifically , patient receive high low potency statin within exposure category classify high potency statin user . Current use high potency statin define last prescription high dose statin prior index date . Current user classify three mutually exclusive duration current exposure ( ≤120 , 121-365 , 366-730 day ) . Statistical analysis Conditional logistic regression use estimate odds ratios correspond 95 % confidence interval ( CIs ) association statin use diabetes endpoint , compare current use high potency statin low potency statin . This consider primary analysis . Several sensitivity analysis perform assess robustness study result address study limitation . High dimensional propensity score estimate patient cohort use logistic regression . Finally , site-specific estimate meta-analyzed use fix random-effects model inverse variance weighting . The amount between-site heterogeneity estimate use I square statistic .</detailed_description>
