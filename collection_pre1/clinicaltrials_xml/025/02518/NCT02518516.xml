The purpose study determine excess risk acute kidney injury ( AKI ) high potency statin compare low potency statin . The investigator carry separate population base cohort study use administrative health care databases nine jurisdiction Canada , US , UK . Cohorts define initiation statin , follow-up hospitalization AKI . Analyses do separately group patient without chronic kidney disease .

	<detailed_description>The study objective determine whether use high potency statin , compare use low potency statin , associate increase risk acute kidney injury ( AKI ) routine clinical practice . The investigator use common-protocol approach conduct retrospective cohort study use health care data nine jurisdiction ( Canadian province Alberta , British Columbia , Manitoba , Nova Scotia , Ontario , Quebec , Saskatchewan , well United States ( US ) MarketScan United Kingdom ( UK ) Clinical Practice Research Datalink [ CPRD ] ) . The Canadian provincial database contain information physician billing , diagnose procedure hospital discharge abstract , dispensation prescription drug population level . The CPRD clinical database representative UK population contains record patient see 680 general practitioner practice UK ; data link Hospital Episode Statistics ( HES ) database , contain in-hospital diagnosis procedure data . Study population In jurisdiction , investigator assemble study cohort include patient new prescription statin , include simvastatin , lovastatin , pravastatin , fluvastatin , atorvastatin , rosuvastatin , early availability data site last date available data . The date study cohort entry define prescription date newly-prescribed statin . For purpose study , two separate cohort create base presence absence history chronic kidney disease time prior include date study cohort entry . Chronic kidney disease define patient 1 hospitalization 1 physician claim 3 year prior study cohort entry follow diagnosis correspond diagnostic code : chronic unspecified renal failure ( ICD-9 : 585 , 586 ; ICD-10 : N18 , N19 ) , hypertensive renal disease ( ICD-9 : 403.x1 , 404.x2 , 404.x3 ; ICD-10 : I12.0 , I13.1 ) , nephritis nephropathy ( ICD-9 : 582 , 583 ; ICD-10 : N03 , N05 ) , renal sclerosis disorder impair renal function ( ICD-9 : 587 , 588 ; ICD-10 : S00-T98 ) . Patients cohort follow date study cohort entry event ( define ) censor due death , departure database , 24 month initiation statin treatment , dispense cerivastatin , end study period ( 31 March 2010 last date data availability site ) , whichever occur first . Data Alberta , Ontario , Nova Scotia restrict patient age 65 year old prescription data available young patient . Case-control selection The cohort define analyzed use nested case-control analysis , case define hospitalization AKI . Risk set sample use randomly select 10 control case , match sex , age ( ± one year ; however , control available , within five year ) , cohort entry ( ± 90 day ) , duration follow-up . Exposure assessment The exposure category separate statin potency ( high vs. low dose ) , duration current past exposure . For case control , exposure define hierarchically ; specifically , patient receive high low potency statin within exposure category classify high potency statin user . Current use high potency statin define last prescription high dose statin within 60 day prior index date . Current user classify three mutually exclusive duration current exposure ( ≤120 , 121-365 , 366-730 day ) . Past exposure define new prescription statin least 120 day prior index date . Statistical analysis All analysis conduct separately among patient without history chronic kidney disease . Conditional logistic regression use estimate odds ratios correspond 95 % confidence interval ( CIs ) association hospitalization AKI , compare current past use high potency statin low potency statin . This consider primary analysis . Several sensitivity analysis perform assess robustness study result address study limitation . High dimensional propensity score estimate patient cohort use logistic regression . Fixed cohort analysis also conduct cohort jurisdiction , statin exposure category define initial prescription cohort entry . Finally , site-specific estimate meta-analyzed use fix random-effects model inverse variance weighting . The amount between-site heterogeneity estimate use I square statistic .</detailed_description>
