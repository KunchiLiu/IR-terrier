	<brief_summary>The purpose study investigate whether long-term heat therapy ( i.e . 8 week hot tub 4-5x per week ) improve biomarkers cardiovascular health young , healthy , able-bodied individual . Although exercise potent mean improve cardiovascular health , many patient unable exercise effectively , thus high demand novel therapy well manage cardiovascular risk patient . If successful , study set groundwork heat therapy use alternative treatment patient limited exercise capability prevention cardiovascular disease .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Chronic Heat Therapy Improving Vascular Health</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Exercise training potent mean improve cardiovascular ( CV ) risk ; however , exercise challenge many patient population . Passive heat therapy may provide simple effective alternative exercise improve CV health , one yet study physiological benefit chronic heat exposure human . Heat exposure induces expression heat shock protein , multitude beneficial effect CV system , many common exercise training . In particular , benefit include upregulation many cellular pathway associate improved vascular function , predominant contributor CV health . The goal study determine effect chronic passive heat therapy vascular function young , healthy , able-bodied individual . The investigator perform randomized-controlled trial subject participate 8 week either heat therapy thermoneutral water immersion ( sham ) . Heat therapy entail 8 week hot water immersion sufficient raise core temperature &gt; 38.5°C 1h , 4-5 time per week . Thermoneutral water immersion entail 8 week immersion 36°C water duration heat therapy . In subject group , investigator measure various well-established biomarkers vascular function 8 week heat therapy , include measure arterial stiffness ( arterial compliance , beta-stiffness , pulse wave velocity ) , endothelium-dependent dilation ( flow-mediated dilation ) , intima medium thickness . The investigator investigate effect heat therapy microvasculature mechanism behind improvement vascular function cutaneous microcirculation , ideal site pharmacodissecting molecular pathway involve , use microdialysis pair laser-Doppler flowmetry . If successful , study serve basis develop heat therapy novel mean improve CV risk , potential reshape treatment patient population limit exercise capability .</detailed_description>
