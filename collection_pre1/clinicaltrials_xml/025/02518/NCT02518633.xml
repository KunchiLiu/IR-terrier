	<brief_summary>Dysfunctional adipose tissue predispose cardiovascular disease . Similarly , risk cardiovascular disease appear increased subject obstructive sleep apnoea . Reduced adipose tissue oxygen availability describe obesity may also mechanism obstructive sleep apnoea . Hypoxia induce inflammation fibrosis adipose tissue factor contribute cardiovascular risk . The investigator hypothesize adipose tissue 's oxygen uptake reduce subject obstructive sleep apnoea compare vivo AT oxygenation blood flow tissue control subject .</brief_summary>
