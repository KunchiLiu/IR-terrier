	<detailed_description>Metabolic syndrome ( MetS ) highly prevalent world , include Taiwan . So far , still standard definition MetS use pediatric population . Thus MetS largely under-diagnosed child adolescent . Obesity hypertension two important requirement criteria MetS . With early detection early intervention MetS child adolescents enable good care reduce heavy burden health care world . MetS might originate early life , namely developmental programming . Cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) common comorbidity MetS . Therefore identification biomarkers detect child high-risk develop CVD MetS progression priority . Investigators ' previous study identify biomarkers variety program model , include asymmetric dimethylarginine ( ADMA , nitric oxide synthase inhibitor ) , β-trace protein ( BTP , also know lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase ) , adiponectin . Thus , current study , ADMA profile , BTP , adiponectin studied child adolescent pre-MetS explore role biomarkers predict MetS CVD progression . In childhood , assessment CVD rely endothelial function arterial stiffness , CV event extremely rare . Thus , study investigator intend perform global vascular assessment ( determine endothelial function arterial stiffness ) child pre-MetS include 24hr ABPM , measure pulse wave velocity ( PWV ) ambulatory arterial stiffness index ( AASI ) detect arterial stiffness , detection flow mediate dilatation ( FMD ) , biomarkers . Investigators also intend examine correlation biomarkers measure vascular parameter child preMetS . Therefore , investigator recruit 150 child adolescent age 6 18 yr overweight/obesity prehypertension/hypertension 50 normal age-matched control reach follow research goal : 1 ) To identify biomarkers risk factor ; 2 ) To characterize impact vascular assessment preMetS child ; 3 ) To examine relationship among biomarkers , vascular assessment parameter , metabolic phenotype .</detailed_description>
