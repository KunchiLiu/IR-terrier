	<brief_title>A Trial Pessary Progesterone Preterm Prevention Twin Gestation With Short Cervix</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Multiple gestation increase risk preterm delivery . Babies born preterm increase rate neonatal mortality long-term neurodevelopmental morbidity . Short cervical length know important risk factor spontaneous preterm birth occur frequently woman twin gestation . Although evidence progesterone reduces risk preterm birth multifetal gestation , evidence progesterone reduces risk prematurity singleton gestation complicate short cervix . The Arabin pessary also show reduce risk preterm birth among singleton short cervix , secondary subgroup analysis recent study use pessary multiple gestation , woman cervical length &lt; 25th percentile significantly reduce risk primary composite neonatal adverse outcome . Secondary analysis study vaginal progesterone multiple gestation short cervix also suggest possible beneficial effect preterm delivery . This protocol outline randomize trial 600 woman evaluate use micronized vaginal progesterone pessary versus control ( placebo ) prevent early preterm birth woman carry twin cervical length le 30 millimeter .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Twin gestation cardiac activity fetus . Higher order multifetal gestation reduce twin , either spontaneously therapeutically , eligible unless reduction occur 12 week project gestational age ( see ) . 2 . Gestational age randomization 16 week 0 day 23 week 6 day base clinical information evaluation early ultrasound describe Gestational Age Determination Section 3.4.2 ; 3 . Cervical length transvaginal examination le 30 mm within 14 day prior randomization study certify sonographer . 1 . Cervical dilation ( internal o ) 2 cm great digital examination evidence prolapse membrane beyond external cervical o either time qualify cervical ultrasound examination cervical exam immediately randomization . There low threshold cervical length measurement threshold ultrasound exclusion criterion . 2 . Monoamniotic gestation , due increase risk adverse pregnancy outcome 3 . Twintwin transfusion syndrome , due increase risk adverse pregnancy outcome 4 . Evidence severe IUGR ( intrauterine growth restriction ) ( &lt; 5th percentile gestational age ) either fetus 5 . Fetal anomaly either twin imminent fetal demise . This include lethal anomaly , anomaly may lead early delivery increase risk neonatal death e.g. , gastroschisis , spina bifida , serious karyotypic abnormality ) . An ultrasound examination 14 week 0 day 23 week 6 day project EDC ( estimate date conception ) must perform prior randomization evaluate fetuses anomaly . 6 . Placenta previa , risk bleed high potential indicate preterm birth 7 . Active vaginal bleeding great spotting time randomization , potential exacerbation due pessary placement 8 . Symptomatic , untreated vaginal cervical infection , also potential exacerbation due pessary placement . Patients may treat subsequently asymptomatic , randomize . 9 . Rupture membrane due likelihood pregnancy loss preterm delivery well risk ascend infection could increase pessary placement 10 . More six contraction per hour report documented prior randomization . It necessary place patient tocodynamometer 11 . Known major Mullerian anomaly uterus ( specifically bicornuate , unicornuate , uterine septum resect ) due increase risk preterm delivery unlikely affect progesterone 12 . Any fetal/maternal condition would require invasive inutero assessment treatment , example significant red cell antigen sensitization neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia 13 . Major maternal medical illness associate increase risk adverse pregnancy outcome indicate preterm birth ( treat hypertension require one agent , pregestational treatment diabetes prior pregnancy , chronic renal insufficiency failure define creatinine &gt; 1.4 mg/dL , carcinoma breast , condition treat chronic oral glucocorticoid therapy . Specifically , patient seizure disorder , HIV , medical condition specifically associate increase risk indicate preterm birth exclude . Prior cervical cone/LOOP/LEEP exclusion criterion . 14 . Planned cerclage cerclage already place since would preclude placement pessary 15 . Planned indicated delivery prior 35 week 16 . Planned actual progesterone treatment type form 14 week 6 day current pregnancy 17 . Allergy progesterone excipients study drug placebo 18 . Participation another interventional study influence gestational age delivery neonatal morbidity mortality 19 . Participation trial previous pregnancy . Patients screen previous pregnancy , randomize , exclude . 20 . Prenatal care delivery plan elsewhere unless study visit make schedule complete outcome information obtain</criteria>
