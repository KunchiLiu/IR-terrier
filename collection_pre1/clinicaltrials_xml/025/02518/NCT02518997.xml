	<brief_title>Effects Reading Preterm Infants Baby Parents ' Well Being</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The NICU Medstar-Georgetown University Hospital care approximately 100 infant per year study population 26-34 week gestation . We patient population parental daily visit norm , allow study use live voice . The investigator approach parent infant meet entry criterion near one week age consultation clinical care team determine stability . All preterm infant admit NICU deem stable enough participate primary team approach study participation . After parental consent obtain , parent give initial questionnaire ass demographic data parental education attitude regard reading infant . Parents give picture book rhythmic sound pattern read aloud infant . Bedside nurse help guide parent best time infant reading . Time parent reading ( start stop time ) record infant 's chart . Mothers father allow read infant separate reading time . A decibel monitor place open incubator display decibel level parental voice . Parents ask read baby least 15 minute 60 minute per session . The total reading time 24 hour period 90 minute . Reading occur infant incubator , open warmer crib hold parent . If infant incubator , parent read portal close parent open . For baby open crib warmer parent read close enough bedside hear neighboring patient . In old infant stable enough kangaroo care bed held parent , read occur time , desire parent . The Infant 's location ( incubator , open bed , kangaroo care parental hold ) record study bedside binder . Parents may also make 30 minute record digital recording device play back baby twice per day parent expect visit total reading time meet . Nursing staff alternate mother father record session neither parent present total reading time day occur . Enrolling 80 infant/parent pair allow subgroup analysis Cardio Respiratory Events ( CREs ) different correct gestational age ( group two cohort 26-30 completed week 31-34 complete week ) comparison effect maternal paternal voice . The study dictate read parent present , encourage father read visit less frequent mother 's . To assess change CREs , NICU admission continuously record infant heart rate , respiratory rate , oxygen saturation , CREs via software capable download data directly infant monitor use routine clinical monitoring NICU , reduce variation bedside chart supply complete documentation infant 's cardiopulmonary status . Assessment parental reading impact assess least three time per week twice per day . Monitoring equipment limit record three infant one time number infant monitor per day impact total number infant study one time . Changes heart rate , respiratory rate , number desaturation apnea bradycardia event score 3 reading session epochs ; one hour reading , read one hour parent reading measure . We also compare CRE score read time CRE score similar period throughout day ( eg 30 minute feeding ) . Enrolled infant require high frequency ventilation temporarily withdraw infant return conventional ventilation . If infant deem ill participate primary team due worsen clinical status , may temporarily withdraw primary team decide he/she stable enough participate . Parent-infant bonding assess via questionnaire administer four time study : enrollment , hospital discharge ( average expect length time 6 week ) 3-months discharge . Attitudes toward read infant pattern read home discharge also record compare . Frequency parent-infant reading discharge compare historical control via survey family whose infant discharge NICU prior study initiation exposure subsequent study-initiated reading education effort . This control group poll parental education , feeling read infant frequency behavior home first 3 month hospital discharge obtain historical baseline study population . Parents prospective reading group receive questionnaire 3 month discharge result compare . Data CREs record multiple time point duration care within incubator outcome follow hospital discharge , average 8 week . Parent-infant reading pattern follow 3 month hospital discharge .</detailed_description>
