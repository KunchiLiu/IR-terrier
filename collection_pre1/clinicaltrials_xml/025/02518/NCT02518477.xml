The primary outcome lymphedema , secondary outcome pain , self-reported symptom swell , sensory disturbance , physical psychological functioning , fatigue , depression , anxiety health relate quality life . 158 patient operate breast cancer axillary node dissection , invite three hospital Denmark , Sealand ( Rigshospitalet , Ringsted Hospital , Herlev Hospital ) , surgical ward . Two week later upon consent recruit , baseline test randomize either exercise intervention usual care control . The exercise intervention consist progressive resistance training , combine stretch programme , total duration 60 minute per session . The group attend supervise exercise twice week weekly home exercise programme 45 60 minute duration . After 20 week , exercise convert home exercise , monitor weekly sms-service . At 12 month , follow-up measurement take group . Lymphedema define 3 % limb volume change baseline measurement .</detailed_description>
