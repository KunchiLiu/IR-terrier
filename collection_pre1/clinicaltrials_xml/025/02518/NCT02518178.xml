	<brief_title>Khushi Baby ( KB ) : Novel Mobile Health Solution Vaccination Record Keeping India</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Routine immunization ( RI ) important tool achieve UN Millennium Development Goal ( MDG ) 4 reduce child mortality ensure childhood protection infectious disease . Recent 2013 estimate find approximately 6.3 million child die fifth birthday , 51.8 % ( 3.3 million ) death attribute infectious disease ( Liu et al. , 2014 ) . In regard vaccine preventable disease ( VPDs ) , pneumonia ( 935,000 death ) diarrhea ( 578,000 death ) responsible death . Measles , pertussis , tetanus , meningitis , four vaccine preventable disease , responsible 362,000 death child five year old . ( Liu et al. , 2014 ) Vaccination one cost-effective intervention increase childhood survival . ( WHO , 2009 ) . Global estimate find current immunization program save 2.5 million life year ( WHO , 2009 ) . Despite lifesaving potential vaccine , 2012 approximately 17 % child , 23 million infant , receive schedule vaccine ( CDC , 2013 ) immunize , often receive vaccination late ( Clark &amp; Sanderson , 2009 ) . In 1985 , Government India launch Universal Immunization Programme ( UIP ) protect infant ( 0-12 month ) six preventable disease : tuberculosis , diphtheria , pertussis , tetanus , poliomyelitis , measles . The goal UIP ensure 100 % coverage eligible child one dose BCG , three dos DTP OPV , one dose measles vaccine . According Coverage Evaluation Survey ( CES ) 2009 , nationwide survey cover States Union Territories India conduct November 2009 January 2010 UNICEF , national fully immunize coverage ( FIC ) six vaccine include UIP age-group 12-23 month old child 61 % ( CES , 2009 ) . Coverage third dose diphtheria , tetanus pertussis vaccine ( DTP3 ) widely accept global indicator RI program performance ( Lim SS , et al . 2008 ) . India national estimate find DTP3 coverage 72 % ( WHO India 2011 ) , global target 90 % . The District Level Health Survey 3 ( DLHS 3 ) finding suggest retention rate childhood immunization maximum decline second round DT polio - 70 % third round - 56 % ( Shekhar &amp; Yadav , 2013 ) . The propose study site , Udaipur district Rajasthan , traditionally low immunization estimate national level also perform poorly key developmental indicator : infant mortality rate ( IMR ) 47 per 1000 live birth ( SRS Bulletin , 2014 , GoI ) maternal mortality rate ( MMR ) 244 per 100,000 woman reproductive age ( MMR Bulletin , 2013 ) . To counter long-standing deficiency immunization coverage health outcome , non-governmental organization ( NGO ) name Seva Mandir begin operation area start 2004 . Seva Mandir , long stand relationship 700 village Rajasthan , 105 village participate immunization program . Immunization camp take place regular , expect interval throughout month caregiver aware schedule camp take place . This study area partner conduct seminal randomized control trial non-monetary incentive improve immunization coverage ( Banerjee A , et al. , 2010 ) . Although renew global focus improve immunization coverage level ( Alonso PL , et al. , 2013 ; Berkley S , et al. , 2013 ) , Rajasthan district still perform poorly routine immunization delivery reporting . In effort improve delivery reporting immunization , subsequent gain proportion infant fully vaccinate , conduct cluster RCT employ novel mHealth technology improve report immunization record increase demand immunization use voice message reminder . One novel mHealth technology use wearable electronic immunization record . This technology couple mobile application ( app ) health worker wearable digital pendant ( necklace ) individual store update medical history . The pendant contain read/writable NFC chip allow health worker digitally update participant 's vaccination record tap phone , without need connect central database . This technology also place sticker could attach immunization booklet would simplify record keep . Importantly , technology distinguish mHealth solution require centralized database patient look patient specific record . Rather , solution decentralize allow patient wear vaccine history necklace access digitally last mile point care . This work extend use NFC tracker simply identify patient count disease occurrence ( Marcus , et al. , 2009 ) medical record storage point care . The potential necklace play symbolic role promotion health benefit additional reason choose form factor . The pendant NFC technology develop student Yale part class project call `` Khushi Baby '' ( KB ) . Yale investigator visit propose study site informally solicit local opinion propose pendant receive feedback Seva Mandir immunization team make KB app user friendly . Importantly , pendant contextually relevant many child study area wear similar talisman local think promote good health prevent cough Others find color shape insecticide bed net relevant factor influence people 's willingness-to-buy ITNs thereby adopt intervention Southern Ethiopia ( Gebresilassie &amp; Mariam , 2011 ) . The KB necklace , unique feature system , also merit deep investigation characteristic influence adoption whether generate peer effect throughout community impact vaccination adherence rate . In addition potentially able increase demand vaccination , NFC chip pendant could potentially improve quantity quality immunization service available efficient monitor outreach system . The current paper system prone loss record due wear tear 9 12 month process complete immunization . Paper system also disadvantage difficult query , individually specific data aggregate transferred , out-dated due time lag data entry . The system digitize vaccine record make individually specific data available remote monitor real time well manage : vaccine stock , resource mobilization camp , camp reminder message via automated voice reminder child 's household mobile phone . It also hold promise improve workflow field . Simply scan chip quickly bring child 's record due vaccine visit without guesswork base otherwise incomplete record . Finally , new information event vaccine denial reason vaccine denial automatically record reveal great insight true vaccine demand give village . Data potential inform service delivery NGO , system , also connect back community serve via voice call reminder . Many mHealth pilot `` push '' base reminder system show promise improve health outcome develop country ( e.g . MedicMobile , M-Power , Frontline SMS , Mobile Alliance Maternal Action ) ; however evidence must collect determine whether personalized voice call specifically reduce immunization drop . An automated backend allow push system reach mothers/primary caregiver village baby due his/her next vaccine . Our approach stand successful several reason : - mHealth solution successfully use improve quality efficiency data collection across range health outcome , even develop world setting . - SMS reminder show success improve immunization coverage timeliness develop area ( Bangure et al. , 2015 ) ; look seek enhancement effect personalized voice reminder local language . - Mobile phone ownership access level all-time global high . Globally , number people own mobile phone grow 1 billion 2000 6 billion 2012 ( World Bank , 2012 ) . Reaching last mile may facilitate remote reminder system alleviate burden local worker hire go door-to-door , walk ten mile day immunization camp - Monthly immunization camp predominant avenue infant vaccinate . This immunization delivery system benefit propose study study staff travel many different clinic and/or household track enrol infant 's immunization status .</detailed_description>
