	<brief_summary>The present study exploratory trial establish feasible DLW ( doubly label water ) protocol implementation clinical trial conduct Profil Institut für Stoffwechselforschung , investigate treatment option overweight obesity population without diabetic comorbidity . The study aim practical validation 1-2-week DLW protocol overweight obese type 2 diabetic subject . Total Energy Expenditure ( TEE ) value assess DLW compare ( 1 ) TEE calculate base individual anthropometric measurement ( include body composition ) use Müller formula AEE ( activity relate energy expenditure ) base report work place leisure time activity ( 2 ) TEE calculate measure REE ( rest energy expenditure ) assess indirect calorimetry AEE base information record subject physical activity diary corresponding pedometer count . Moreover , TEE assessment repeat ( separate 2-4 week ) determine intra-subject variability / re-test reliability measurement .</brief_summary>
