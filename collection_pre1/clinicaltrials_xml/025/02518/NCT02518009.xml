	<detailed_description>At Centre andrology sexual medicine Karolinska University Hospital 30 genetic male ( MtF ) 25 genetic female ( FtM ) every year start hormone replacement therapy . This hormonal treatment include inhibition one 's sex hormone production ( regulation gonadal axis ) follow treatment testosterone estrogen level normal opposite sex . Seen experimental model , process provide opportunity study sex hormone dependent influence explain difference morbidity men woman respectively . Furthermore , constitutional difference distinguish dynamically addressable change hormonal milieu . The difference especially significant well know 1 ) metabolic change regulation glucose homeostasis lipid metabolism 2 ) regulation vascular function structural effect heart arteries 3 ) regulation skeletal muscle mass fat tissue 4 ) morphological functional effect discrete area brain . It well known testosterone dose-response effect body composition men condition less well know woman . Thus , know adult woman 's body respond male level testosterone , dose response relation similar different men . The clinical impression woman less effect androgen muscle mass men . Furthermore , know whether qualitative property comparable , i.e . muscle force/unit area . The basic hypothesis constitutional sex difference androgen response . If difference , look identify difference gene expression . Another hypothetical regulatory mechanism epigenetic difference dynamically modifiable androgen exposition . Difference cardiovascular morbidity men woman well know , considerable confusion radical change sex hormone level affect function cardiovascular system acute chronic exposure . Radical change estrogen testosterone level also affect risk metabolic disorder ( lipid , carbohydrate protein metabolism ) cause hazard metabolic diseases diabetes cardiovascular disease long term also risk future muscle weakness osteoporosis . Effects central nervous system result change sex hormone profile well know . However , several observation indicate change sex hormone level visual effect ( show MRI PET ) distinctive feature central nervous system . Therefore , follow patient year study heart , blood vessel , brain , risk factor cardiovascular disease affect altered sex hormone pattern study happens muscle fat short long term respect particular gene expression epigenetic change link metabolic change body composition . Forty volunteer gender dysphoria , 20 MtF 20 FtM , study onset sex hormone therapy , four-week shutdown endogenous sex hormone one year sex hormone treatment .</detailed_description>
