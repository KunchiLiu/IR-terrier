	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well ibrutinib work give together vaccine therapy treat patient without clinical sign indication raise possibility particular disorder dysfunction ( asymptomatic ) high-risk chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma . Ibrutinib may stop growth cancer cell block enzymes need cell growth . Vaccines , pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine , trivalent influenza vaccine , diphtheria toxoid/tetanus toxoid/acellular pertussis vaccine adsorb , may help body build effective immune response kill cancer cell . Giving ibrutinib together vaccine therapy may better treatment chronic lymphocytic leukemia small lymphocytic lymphoma .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Ibrutinib Immune Modulating Agent Patients With Asymptomatic , High-risk CLL/SLL Risk Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine 2-year progression-free survival asymptomatic , high-risk genomic chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) patient treat ibrutinib . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine whether concurrent administration ibrutinib 2 dos pneumococcal vaccine ( pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine ) negatively impact immune response compare receive pneumococcal vaccination sequential therapy . II . To determine safety toxicity associate administer ibrutinib asymptomatic , high-risk genomic CLL patient . III . To determine response pattern ( complete response [ CR ] minimal residual disease [ MRD ] - , CR , partial response [ PR ] , PR lymphocytosis , stable disease [ SD ] ) asymptomatic , genomic high-risk patient treat ibrutinib . VI . To determine change stress , anxiety depressive symptom , relate quality life indicator patient treat ibrutinib .</detailed_description>
