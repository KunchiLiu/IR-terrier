	<brief_summary>The ovarian surface , Fallopian tube , uterine cavity peritoneal cavity together form communicate compartment . The physiologic function ciliated line tube transport egg , ovulation , uterine cavity . Thus , make likely exfoliated cell pathologic change ovarian surface Fallopian tube line present lavage uterine cavity . The proof concept malignant cell upper genital tract get transport even low genital tract recently publish Kind I. et al . Liquid-based cervical cytology allow cytological evaluation also collection DNA . A panel gene commonly mutate endometrial ovarian cancer assemble new whole-exome sequencing data 22 endometrial cancer previously publish data tumour type , include mutation TP53 gene . This panel use search mutation 24 endometrial 22 ovarian cancer identify mutation 46 sample . With sensitive massively parallel sequence method , possible identify mutation DNA liquid Pap smear specimens 100 % endometrial cancer ( 24 24 ) 41 % ovarian cancer ( 9 22 ) . In current project investigator study specificity sensitivity lavage uterine cavity proximal tubes test differentiate malign benign ovarian tumour . The investigator aim detect cell EOCs genetic material cell lavage .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Lavage Uterine Cavity Diagnosis Ovarian Tubal Carcinoma - Study Sensitivity Specificity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epithelial ovarian cancer ( EOC ) lead cause death among gynaecologic malignancy western civilized country , estimate prevalence Europe US 752,600 2007 59,828 death annually . Treatment survival patient depend primarily stage disease . Of EOC patient 25 % diagnose early stage tumour confine pelvis . In case five-year survival rate 80 % 90 % disease often cure combination surgery chemotherapy . Unfortunately , almost 75 % woman affect advanced stage disease metastatic spread throughout abdominal cavity retroperitoneal lymph node time diagnosis ; five-year survival rate drop 10 % -30 % advanced disease , despite maximum surgical effort combination chemotherapy . Currently , state art differential diagnosis malignant benign ovarian pathology suspicious EOC relies predominantly transvaginal ultrasonography serum cancer antigen ( CA-125 ) measurement . The specificity diagnostic tool however low , test effective enough reliably differentiate benign malignant condition . Even highly specialise unit , patient receive surgery suspect ovarian cancer 20 % malignant disease . These finding underline need new diagnostic test , able well differentiate benign malignant ovarian change . This would possibly spear many patient unnecessary surgery completely improve triage patient malignant ovarian tumour highly specialise gynaecologic oncology unit . A promising approach improvement differential diagnosis suspicious ovarian change establish Paul Speiser Robert Zeillinger ( Molecular Oncology Group , Department General Gynaecology Gynaecologic Oncology , Medical University Vienna , Austria ) ( EK 1148/2011 ) . This approach call ALPINE technique ( Austrian Lavage Procedure Detection tubal Intraepithelial Neoplasms ) ( manuscript preparation ) . It include lavage uterine cavity proximal fallopian tube subsequent analysis lavage fluid presence pre-malignant malignant cell . For proof principle tumour cell shed ovarian cancer find lavage uterine cavity , uterine lavage collect surgical intervention suspect ovarian malignancy investigator ' institution Catholic University Leuven , Department Obstetrics Gynaecology . After malignancy confirm , genetic change TP53 KRAS gene determine tumour tissue . In set 9 epithelial ovarian cancer patient ( EOC ) 1 ovarian metastasis signet ring carcinoma , presence genetic change examine lavage sample , use digital droplet PCR ( ddPCR ) . Ten genetic change identify tumour tissue patient 9/10 ( 90 % ) change detect corresponding lavage specimen . Mutation rate range 0.01 % 39.65 % EOC patient . Furthermore , filter approach , follow p53 immunofluorescence stain establish , confirm presence tumour cell lavage sample one additional patient . In next step , lavage sample 22 ovarian carcinoma patient , applicable correspond tumour tissue , analyse deep sequencing group Bert Vogelstein ( Johns Hopkins University , Baltimore , USA ) . The presence genetic change , indicative ovarian cancer , could confirm 16/22 ( 72.7 % ) lavage specimen . Of 18 patient , correspond tumor tissue available , show mutation . These result proof ovarian cancer cell shed fallopian tube uterine cavity , collect ALPINE technique . The fact ovarian cancer cell detect high sensitivity lavage uterine cavity proximal tube show approach great potential differential diagnosis ovarian mass .</detailed_description>
