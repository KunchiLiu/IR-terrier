	<brief_title>Improving Comprehensive Cancer Screening Among Vulnerable Patients Using Patient Navigation</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>It important note TopCare system currently standard care MGPC-PBRN . As , proposal involve evaluate TopCare system patient provider use . Rather , study evaluates part TopCare system involve automate identification referral PN patient increase risk screen non-adherence . All eligible patient overdue cancer screen test receive usual care include reminder letter referral schedule delegate follow-up . Since TopCare system represent usual care patient MGH primary care network , patient contact occur solely research purpose . The study involve randomly assign patient overdue screen identify high risk complete screen early delay PN . We believe random assignment ethical PN extremely limit resource , patient network identify high risk complete screening could contact navigator short period time . Thus randomly assign access PN study period , allow patient navigated study period . As result , overdue , high risk patient refer PN , time referral randomly assign . In study , objective improve algorithm automatically identify patient likely benefit PN ( Specific Aim 1 ) , evaluate clinical impact PN randomize control trial within MGPC-PBRN ( Specific Aim 2 ) . We also survey patient identify TopCare algorithm ass overall satisfaction healthcare determine whether PN impact satisfaction healthcare ( Specific Aim 3 ) . Revising improve current 'high risk ' algorithm automatically identify patient may help PN Specific Aim 1 help u effectively utilize limited PN resource . The current algorithm utilizes information patient age , number overdue test , primary language , no-show visit history . We investigate add patient registration information insurance education status well identify patient high risk complete screen . In Specific Aim 2 , randomize eligible patient MGPC-PBRN primary care practice either Arm 1 - TopCare PN : Patients identify high risk complete screen automate algorithm assign PN list contact help schedule complete screening ( breast , cervical , colon ) , Arm 2 - TopCare without PN : These patient benefit standard feature TopCare system , include automate identification overdue patient , patient reminder letter , referral schedule delegate . All high risk patient arm eligible PN study period .</detailed_description>
