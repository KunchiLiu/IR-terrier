	<brief_summary>Aim present study investigate influence hyperoxia protein expression use differential analysis protein expression tissue ( proteomics ) . In study , blood urine sample collect participant undergo short term hyperoxia use 100 % oxgen 3 hour . Here , gel electrophoresis , protein separation mass spectroscopy allow identify affected protein . Based result , different induction factor protein determine assessed use bioinformatic network analysis regard cellular influence .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Oxygen necessary sustain human life use energy production oxidation mitochondrion . Application oxygen increase saturation patient 's blood , also various secondary effect . It therefore use treat disease impair body 's ability take use oxygen . But even healthy people suffer hypoxia ascend high altitude . Here , altitude sickness lead potentially fatal complication high altitude cerebral edema high altitude pulmonary edema . Since hypoxia disastrous consequence , hyperoxia often tolerate many pre- in-hospital situation . Whereas effect hypoxia well study , especially publication last decade lead new perspective oxygen application . Besides pathophysiological change peripheral vasoconstriction reduction contractility , especially change cellular level seem great importance . Here , oxidative stress change protein synthesis various organ focus current study . The differential analysis protein expression tissue ( proteomics ) important approach well understanding negative effect hyperoxia . Especially patient long-term high oxygen demand knowledge cellular change hyperoxia result new therapeutic approach reduction rate complication . In present molecular biology study urine blood sample healthy volunteer collect specified time short-term exposure oxygen . These sample analyze study use differential analysis protein expression . The aim study investigate effect oxygen cell function analyze subsequent bioinformatic processing differentially regulate protein blood urine . After check inclusion exclusion criterion biometric data test person collect . Before short-term hyperoxia sample collection blood urine perform . Here participants take 5 ml venous blood cephalic vein sterile condition . To obtain urine sample spontaneous urine participant use . The sample immediately centrifuge flash frozen -80°C . In order exclude impairment lung prior short-term hyperoxia pulmonary function test carry use hand spirometer . To induce hyperoxia subject inhale 100 % oxygen 3 hour face mask . After carry short term hyperoxia follow phase take place . In phase blood urine sample subject obtain directly hyperoxia ( T0 ) , day 1 ( T1 ) , day 3 ( T3 ) , day 7 ( T7 ) , day 14 ( T14 ) , day 21 ( T21 ) day 28 ( T28 ) oxygen exposure . All sample centrifuge immediately collection flash frozen -80 ° C. To exclude hyperoxia-induced lung impairment , spirometry perform follow . After sample subject collect analysis sample carry use Proteomics .</detailed_description>
