	<brief_summary>This project aim evaluate whether dose-response relationship exist dose polyunsaturated fatty acid ( PUFA ) , deliver eicosapentaenoic acid ( EPA ) , change marker inflammation , whether effect differ placebo . A key secondary aim evaluate antidepressant effectiveness EPA overweight adult outpatient current major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . To address aim , project use four-arm , randomize , parallel-group , placebo-controlled design compare placebo versus three dos EPA ( 1 gm/day , 2 gm/day , 4 gm/day ) administer 12 week . The study conduct two site : Emory University School Medicine , Massachusetts General Hospital . Eligible participant age 18-80 current MDD , overweight , demonstrate peripheral inflammation , define high sensitivity C-reactive protein ( hs-CRP ) level ≥ 3 mg/L . The primary outcome change plasma interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) level and/or mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell ( PBMC ) Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha ( TNF-α ) expression level EPA- versus placebo-treated participant . The result investigation intend use design power large definitive test efficacy biological effect EPA patient major depressive disorder .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This study evaluate anti-inflammatory effect antidepressant efficacy tolerability EPA versus placebo treatment MDD . The study design randomize , placebo-controlled , double-blind parallel-group dose-finding 12 week outpatient clinical trial . The study population consist outpatient overweight suffer MDD , also demonstrate systemic inflammation . Three dos EPA ( 1 gm/d , 2 gm/d , 4 gm/d ) compare placebo . The study conduct two site : Emory University School Medicine Massachusetts General Hospital . The study conduct Food Drug Administration Investigational New Drug ( IND ) 074150 . One hundred adult MDD patient ( age 18-80 ) randomize enter 12-week double-blind treatment period . Each four study arm ( 3 EPA arm one placebo arm ) 25 patient , expectation 20 completers per arm , base 20 % early termination rate . The subject recruit advertisement clinical referral psychiatrists general physician treat overweight outpatient MDD . Participants must agree significantly modify diet 12 week study . Due need participant hs-CRP ≥ 3 mg/L eligible study , two screen visit use minimize expense associate screen . The screening period may extend 28 day prior baseline visit ( Visit 3 ) necessary allow time need participant schedule allow require repeat laboratory test . Patients screen study find eligible return baseline visit one week , psychotropic medication PUFAs administer . Patients must Inventory Depressive Symptoms , Clinician rat ( IDS-C30 ) total score ≥ 25 baseline visit order eligible randomization . Patients randomize one four treatment arm : 1 ) EPA 1 mg/day ; 2 ) EPA 2 mg/day ; 3 ) EPA 4 mg/day ; 4 ) Placebo . Randomization block 4 separate randomization schedule site . Study material include : 1 . Study capsule contain EPA-enriched omega-3 , 1000 mg tab , supply Nordic Naturals . 2 . Placebo capsule match EPA 1000 mg tab , also supply Nordic Naturals . Documentation presence side-effect adverse event ( AE ) complete one treating psychiatrist every visit record spontaneously report AEs , classify either mild , moderate , severe . Adverse event cod use Medical Dictionary Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) term . Patients shall allow contact investigator member staff time visit concern adverse event worsen symptom . All concomitant medication take study record case report form , along dosage information start stop date . Drugs may take patient include prescription over-the-counter medication specifically exclude protocol . Patients require exclude drug ( include antidepressant , benzodiazepine , antipsychotic , psychostimulants , mood stabilize agent ) discontinue study . Patients may choose withdraw study time . Participants may withdraw investigator follow occur : 1. severe , persistent intolerance study medication 2. worsen depressive symptom subject 's safety endanger ( e.g . suicidality ) 3. development mania psychotic symptom 4. serious adverse event ( SAE ) either : ) consider investigator possibly , probably , definitely relate study medication , ii ) place subject increase risk harm continue study 5. persistent non-adherence study medication , define take 80-120 % study medication pill two consecutive visit 6. development pregnancy Patients MDD may experience worsen depression and/or emergence suicidal ideation behavior ( suicidality ) , whether take antidepressant medication , risk may persist MDD remission occur . This guidance consistent global class label antidepressant . Although long-standing concern antidepressant may role induce worsen depression emergence suicidality certain subject , causal role antidepressant induce behavior establish . Nevertheless , subject treat study medication observe closely clinical worsen suicidality , especially begin end course treatment , time dose change , either increase decrease . Consideration give possibly discontinue investigational product subject whose depression persistently bad whose emergent suicidality severe abrupt onset part subject 's presenting symptom . To assess suicidal ideation behavior , CSSRS use trial . The following symptom , anxiety , agitation , panic attack , insomnia , irritability , hostility , impulsivity , akathisia ( psychomotor restlessness ) , hypomania , mania , report patient treated antidepressant MDD . Consideration give possibly discontinue study medication subject symptoms severe , abrupt onset , part subject 's presenting symptom . Research participant exit study follow occur : - Any emergent Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( CSSRS ) define suicidal behavior - A suicidal ideation score 5 ( indicate active suicidal ideation specific plan level intent ) CSSRS - In absence CSSRS suicidal ideation score 5 CSSRS-defined suicidal behavior , investigator determines patient significant short-term risk suicide attempt . Any participant becomes pregnant study withdrawn study . The investigator collect pregnancy information , record Pregnancy Form , submit lead site PI , Mark Rapaport , MD , via email within 2 week learn participant 's pregnancy . The participant also follow determine outcome pregnancy . Follow-up expected end approximately 8 week follow estimate delivery date . Any premature termination pregnancy report . While pregnancy consider adverse event ( AE ) SAE , pregnancy complication elective termination pregnancy medical reason record AE . A spontaneous abortion always consider SAE report . All randomize participant terminate trial prior Week 12 visit ask return early termination visit . The study team complete Week 12 assessment study termination visit . All subject complete trial discontinue lack response side effect receive treatment clinically appropriate referred appropriate follow-up care . Blood collect analyzed screening test biomarker analysis . Urine sample collect analyzed toxicology screen urinalysis . We collect physical record form questionnaire , phone screening , psychiatric interview . We request access participant ' medical record reason related patient safety . Participant case report form keep lock file cabinet office study site . Biological specimen link individual patient unique research code . All document directly reveal participant 's identity , sign consent form , store chart mark outside participant 's code number .</detailed_description>
