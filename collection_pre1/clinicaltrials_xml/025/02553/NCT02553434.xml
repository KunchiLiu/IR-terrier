	<brief_summary>After sustain severe trauma chest , patient often bleed chest cavity pleural space ) call hemothorax may also experience air leakage within chest cavity combination bleeding ( hemopneumothorax ) . The treatment condition include insertion tube chest call chest tube ) . Insertion chest tube commonly painful patient due size diameter tube . Alternatively , procedure standard practice acute care set Banner-University Arizona Tucson Campus ( B-UATC ) insert pigtail catheter , small diameter , chest wall treat hemothorax hemopnuemothorax . The primary purpose study see use pigtail catheter effective chest tube insertion term remove leak blood and/or air chest cavity . An additional objective study evaluate procedure less painful patient .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Comparing 14 F Pigtail Catheter Traditional 28-32F Chest Tube Management Traumatic Hemothorax Hemopneumothorax</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The standard treatment traumatic hemothorax ( HTX ) hemopneumothorax ( HPTX ) insertion large-bore chest tube ( CT ) ( French 28-32 ) . The procedure associate significant patient 's pain discomfort . Investigator 's institution take lead role replace chest tube insertion pigtail catheter ( PC ) ( 14F ) insertion . The investigator previously publish , PC work well traditional CT pneumothorax 1 ) hemothorax ( 2 ) , also associate significant less insertion pain tube site pain ( 3 ) . In hemothorax study , investigator report 36 patient received PC HTX ( 2 ) success 32-36F chest tube term initial output success rate ; success rate define intervention need . Since completion study ( December 2011 ) , investigator 's division insert probably 100 PC hemothorax hemopneumohthorax Therefore , investigator believe time investigator demonstrate efficacy PC hemothorax prospective randomize study investigator do previously traumatic pneumothorax ( 3 ) . The investigator hypothesize pigtail catheter effective chest tube patient traumatic HTX HPTX . The investigator ' study aim demonstrate efficacy pigtail catheter prospective randomize fashion do previously pneumothorax . The investigator ' primary end point success/failure rate . Failure define second intervention require i.e. , second tube , video-assisted thoracoscopy ( VATS ) , etc . The investigator ' secondary end point amount initial tube drainage , 24-hour , 48-hour , 72-hour ; complication , hospital length stay , chest tube pigtail insertion experience express patient .</detailed_description>
