	<brief_title>The Efficacy Breathing Exercise With BreatheMAX Device Airway Secretion Clearance Lung Function</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Effective strategy increase mucus clearance rate suggest depend 4 factor . 1 . Oscillation proper frequency . 2 . Lung volume airway open . 3 . Expiratory flow rate expiratory bias . 4 . Humidifying inspired air . Multifunctional breathing device , BreatheMAX , breathe device make Thailand . The BreatheMAX device possess many property technique benefit respiratory care particularly 3 4 mechanism secretion clearance . The unique important aspect simultaneously provide several beneficial effect one breath 1 ) Oscillation range ciliary beat frequency 2 ) Biofeedback respiratory effort could encourage deep breathing performance , 3 ) Humidifier inspire air , 4 ) Loaded breathe inspiratory muscle training generate PEP . These 4 function would useful increase secretion clearance particularly peripheral airway difficult clear risk atelectasis infection patient MV whose natural secretion clearance mechanism compromise , respiratory muscle weakness weak low immunity . Therefore , combination inspiratory expiratory breathing exercise BreatheMAX breathing device may increase promote secretion clearance improve lung function expiratory breathe exercise alone intubated patient , without mechanical ventilation dependence</detailed_description>
