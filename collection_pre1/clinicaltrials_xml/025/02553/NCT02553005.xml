	<brief_summary>Rheumatoid Arthritis ( RA ) systemic inflammatory disease characterize functional disability pain . Although acupuncture widely use , western acupuncture study RA show conclusive positive result . Acupuncture regard reflex therapy , Traditional Chinese Medicine ( TCM ) diagnosis show individual neurovegetative state allow individually allocate acupoints . Positive result report use classical diagnostic procedure allocate acupoints patient accord Shang Han Lun . The investigator interested acupuncture compatible ancient theory would successful improve hand function RA patient . The investigator therefore develop prospective randomize control trial three-armed parallel group design standardize treatment intervention . Only patient TCM diagnosis so-called Turning Point syndrome allow experimental phase . This may harmonize TCM diagnosis standardize intervention , order optimize potential therapeutic effect .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>The study design divide two part . First investigator follow non-experimental nature design . Based result exploratory study start three-armed parallel-group study equal randomization ( 1:1:1 ) , prospective , double-blind , placebo-controlled multicenter conduct Portugal ( 2 site ) . We plan include 381 patient RA hand accordance selection criterion . The patient go recruited national center rheumatology patient association time May 2015 October 2016 . All patient suppose sign inform consent time enrollment accord rule Helsinki Declaration . Task 1 In first task go develop non-experimental , exploratory descriptive nature design goal describe epidemiological , clinical genetic profile patient RA hand accord TCM diagnosis . We use individual instrument collection data characterize patient socio-demographically clinically . The main characteristic , complaint objective examination participant , characterize qualify experienced acupuncturist ( first physician ) , accordance Heidelberg Model ( HM ) TCM . This physician ass pain hand use pressure algometer two different distinct point . It well know low ability tolerate pressure , bad individual pain . The researcher also record clinical feature base data tongue-diagnosis conduct Automatic Tongue Diagnosis System ( ATDS ) . The result far demonstrate ATDS consistent even setting different environmental lighting . The correlation pattern classification TCM biomarkers express genetic profile RA patient explore similarly recent study whose result indicate different pattern could regard consequence biological network deviant gene expression various affect tissue immune effector cell . Due financial limitation , select 15 participant randomly different TCM pattern find . Eight ml venous blood collect anticoagulation tube participant test microarray assay use Trizol extraction method . Task 2 Next , aim evaluate effect acupuncture pain strength hand accord criterion HM TCM specific vegetative functional state call TP syndrome . A sample 90 patient clinical feature TP syndrome assign randomly one three parallel group , 1:1:1 ratio either control , verum sham group help computer-generated randomization programme . The first physician mark point red blue colour patient randomize verum intervention group well patient assign sham intervention group . Afterwards , first physician present data study-coordination program assign colour-codes sequence possible treatment modality use computer-generated randomization table . A second physician inform programme colour point suppose needled . The second physician perform respective standardized needling technique select point indicate colour corresponds either sham verum point . We decide use Leopard Spot technique , blood-letting acupuncture therapy use sterile subcutaneous needle ( 0,30mmx8mm ) know increase local microcirculation induce vegetative response . All patient receive three session treatment . After acupuncture session , patient must dress light garment cover potential mark needle . Before treatment , patient return first physician assessment outcome . The first physician know acupuncture point use . The participant follow six time Assessment ( 0 ) take place randomization ; assessment ( 1 ) , ( 3 ) ( 5 ) take place five minute intervention ; assessment ( 2 ) do 24 hour first intervention assessment ( 4 ) three day first intervention . The assessment include evaluation patient tolerance pain hand use pressure algometer ; measurement grip strength help dynamometer evaluation nerve conduction muscle function hand use electromyography . Task 3 In task intend longitudinal study assess effect acupuncture treatment inflammation quality life . The patient randomize group 2 3 treat two time per week , period three week , respect interval 72 hour treatment . Therefore participant follow assessment ( 6 ) , ( 8 ) , ( 10 ) , ( 12 ) , ( 14 ) ( 16 ) - ( intervention ) assessment ( 7 ) , ( 5 ) , ( 9 ) , ( 11 ) , ( 13 ) , ( 15 ) ( 17 ) - ( five minute intervention ) ( Appendix 6 ) . The assessment ( 0 ) , ( 5 ) ( 18 ) also include another parameter measure inflammation condition : cortisol interleukin level saliva . All patient randomize group 1 , 2 3 follow assessment ( 0 ) ( 18 ) - 28 day assessment ( 0 ) , also measure pain Visual Analogue Scale quality life Health Survey SF-36 . The result first task conduct analyze statistical data , use technique descriptive statistic nonparametric test . To second third task result analyze Pearson Correlation Coefficients Multivariate Analysis Variance significance set p &lt; 0,05 .</detailed_description>
