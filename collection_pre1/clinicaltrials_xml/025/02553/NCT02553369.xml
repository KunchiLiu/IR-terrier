	<brief_summary>Late 2013 , first indigenous case chikungunya observed French Antilles . At end May 2014 , almost island Caribbean affect outbreak . During large epidemic affect Island La RÃ©union 2005/2006 , attack rate 38 % . The active period three month . In context , knowledge attack rate epidemic Caribbean important issue outbreak management modeling work . As chikungunya virus never circulate Caribbean , determine seroconversion rate achieve realize seroprevalence survey among general population end outbreak . Another simple method estimate rate cohort patient follow regularly whose habitat distribute throughout territory study . The follow patient infect human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) French West Indies almost exclusively performed hospital department Infectious Tropical Diseases.The high prevalence HIV homogeneous distribution infect patient territory , allow hypothesize risk transmission arboviruses exposure mosquito bite comparable general population . This patient cohort well suit study emergence Chikungunya French West Indie . Primary objective : To estimate cumulative incidence end first Chikungunya outbreak French West Indies estimate prevalence specific antibody chikungunya virus sample ( randomly constitute ) patient infected HIV representative general population Martinique Guadeloupe Secondary objective : To estimate frequency asymptomatic infection chikungunya virus study population To estimate frequency chronic form chikungunya study population</brief_summary>
