	<criteria>1 . Subjects must sign dated IRB approve write informed consent accordance regulatory institutional guideline . This must obtain performance protocol relate procedure part normal subject care . 2 . Subjects must willing able comply schedule visit , treatment schedule , laboratory test , tumor biopsy , requirement study . 3 . Pathologically confirm locally advanced metastatic disease per treat institution 's standard care follow tumor type Subjects histologically confirm locally advanced/unresectable metastatic melanoma meet follow criterion : . Subjects received number prior line therapy may treatment naïve ii . If subject treat prior line therapy , must disease progression refractory treatment OR b . Subjects histologically cytologically confirm locally advanced/unresectable metastatic urothelial carcinoma ( include mixed histology urothelial carcinoma element subtypes ) renal pelvis , ureter , bladder urethra ( refer broadly protocol `` bladder cancer '' ) meet follow criterion : . Subjects must disease progression refractory disease prior line therapy . Subjects must least 1 platinum base chemotherapy regimen treatment metastatic locally advanced unresectable disease . Subjects may receive number prior line therapy OR ii . Subjects disease recurrence within 1 year platinum base neoadjuvant adjuvant therapy bladder cancer . OR iii . The subject actively refuse chemotherapy treatment metastatic locally advanced disease consider standard treatment disease stage ( i.e . patient relapse &gt; 1 year treatment neoadjuvant adjuvant chemotherapy ) , despite informed investigator treatment option . The subject 's refusal must document . 4 . Subjects must measurable disease CT scan MRI per RECIST 1.1 criterion . Radiographic tumor assessment must perform within 28 day prior first dose study drug . 5 . Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status 01 . 6 . Age ≥ 18 year . 7 . Subjects must consent allow acquisition tumor sample prior start treatment study ( case patient require tumor biopsy ) . This biopsy site may site measurable disease site &gt; 2 cm . The biopsy site must , opinion investigator , likely yield acceptable tumor sample core biopsy describe Appendix 4 . It also acceptable tumor sample obtain excision biopsy surgery ( i.e . procedure previously plan ) , provide tumor sample process described Appendix 4 . In case patient tumor sample acquire prior consent study tumor sample acceptable processing describe Appendix 4 ( i.e . frozen sample store ) tumor sample acquire within 60 day start treatment , acceptable new biopsy require . 8 . Willingness adhere study visit schedule prohibition specify protocol . 9 . Expected survival least 4 month . 10 . At time day 1 study , patient must complete chemotherapy , target therapy , investigational therapy , immunotherapy , radiation therapy major surgery ( require general anesthesia ) least 28 day administration first dose nivolumab . Patients undergo minor surgical procedure biopsy require general anesthesia may begin receive study therapy sufficiently recover determined treat investigator . Patients may receive prior focal radiotherapy palliation isolate site disease , must complete least 14 day prior day 1 study . Palliative ( limitedfield ) radiation therapy permit treatment study drug ( ) , follow criterion meet : 1 . The lesion consider palliative radiation target lesion 2 . Radiation treatment administer 12 week great first dose study drug . 11 . All baseline laboratory requirement assess obtain within 14 day first dose study drug . Screening laboratory value must meet following criterion : White blood cell ( WBCs ) ≥ 2000/μL Neutrophils ≥ 1000/μL Platelets ≥ 100 x 103/μL Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( glomerular filtration rate ≥ 40mL/min ) Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN ( except subject Gilbert 's syndrome must total bilirubin ≤ 3.0mg/dL ) AST ALT ≤ 3 x ULN Albumin ≥ 3.0 g/dL 1 . Active brain metastasis leptomeningeal metastasis . Subjects treat brain metastasis eligible meet follow criterion : 1 . Must least 28 day since craniotomy resection , stereotactic radiosurgery , whole brain radiotherapy . 2 . Must evidence progression least 4 week treatment complete within 28 day prior first dose study drug administration . 3 . Must requirement immunosuppressive dos systemic corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent ) least 2 week prior study drug administration . 2 . Any serious uncontrolled medical disorder , opinion investigator , may increase risk associate study participation study drug administration , impair ability subject receive protocol therapy interfere interpretation study result . 3 . Other prior malignancy active within previous 2 year except local organ confine early stage cancer definitively treat curative intent require treatment , require ongoing treatment , evidence active disease negligible risk recurrence therefore unlikely interfere endpoint study . 4 . Subjects active autoimmune disease , symptoms condition . Subjects vitiligo , type I diabetes , residual hypothyroidism due autoimmune thyroiditis require hormone replacement , asymptomatic laboratory evidence autoimmune disease ( e.g . : +ANA , +RF , antithyroglobulin antibody ) , condition expect recur absence external trigger permit enroll . 5 . Subjects condition require systemic treatment either corticosteroid ( &gt; 10 mg daily prednisone equivalent ) immunosuppressive medication within 14 day first dose study drug . Inhaled topical steroid , adrenal replacement steroid dos permit absence active autoimmune disease . 6 . Subjects receive prior therapy T cell costimulation checkpoint pathway antiPD1 , antiPDL1 , antiPDL2 , antiCTLA4 , antiCD137 ; medicine specifically target T cell prohibit . Prior therapy BCG permit . Prior IL2 permit . 7 . All toxicity attribute prior anticancer therapy alopecia fatigue must resolve grade 1 ( CTCAE version 4 ) baseline administration study drug . Subjects toxicity attribute prior anticancer therapy expect resolve result long lasting sequela neuropathy platinumbased therapy , permit enroll . 8 . Positive test hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) use HBV surface antigen ( HBV sAg ) test positive test hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) use HCV ribonucleic acid ( RNA ) HCV antibody test indicate acute chronic infection . 9 . Known history test positive human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) know acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . 10 . History allergy study drug component history severe hypersensitivity reaction monoclonal antibody 11 . Women breast feed pregnant evidence positive serum pregnancy test ( minimum sensitivity 25 IU/L equivalent unit HCG ) do within 14 day first dose urine test within 72 hour first dose . 12 . Women childbearing potential * ( WOCBP ) use medically acceptable mean contraception throughout study treatment least 23 week follow last dose study treatment ( 5 halflives study drug plus 30 day duration ovulatory cycle ) . *WOCBP define experienced menarche undergone successful surgical sterilization ( hysterectomy , bilateral tubal ligation , bilateral oophorectomy ) postmenopausal . Postmenopausal define : Amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive month without another cause , For woman irregular menstrual period hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) , document serum follicle stimulate hormone ( FSH ) level &gt; 35 mIU/mL 13 . Male subject unwilling use contraception treatment least 31 week last dose study treatment ( 5 halflives study drug plus 90 day duration sperm turnover ) . 14 . Subjects compulsorily detain treatment either psychiatric physical ( e.g. , infectious disease ) illness .</criteria>
