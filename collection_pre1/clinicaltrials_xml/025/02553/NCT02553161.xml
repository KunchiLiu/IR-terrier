	<brief_title>Mechanism Antidepressant-Related Dysfunctional Arousal High-Risk Youth</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The primary goal proposal investigate etiological mechanism associate antidepressant-related dysfunctional emotional arousal characterize baseline neurobiological risk factor predict development dysfunctional emotional arousal treatment seek youth family history BD . Antidepressants moderate benefit treat mood anxiety disorder childhood effect develop brain largely unknown . Antidepressants among commonly prescribe medication use youth United States use treat many psychiatric disorder include depression , dysthymia anxiety . However , recent review suggest antidepressant provide mild moderate benefit . Moreover , grow number case report clinical study describe antidepressant-related psychiatric adverse event aggression , psychosis , agitation , suicidal ideation , hypomania mania , behavior associate increased emotional arousal . Importantly , adverse event likely occur child adult . With young age treatment combine increase repeated exposure critical sensitive period neurodevelopment , adverse event become rise concern youth , may lead development serious psychopathology youth carry enormous burden illness , bipolar disorder ( BD ) . Given BD typically begin 18 year age depressive episode , million youth U.S. year experience first bipolar episode depressive episode routinely treat antidepressant . However , mechanism risk factor antidepressant increase risk develop adverse outcome largely unknown . Youth family history BD high likelihood develop adverse response antidepressant , possibly youth already vulnerable develop dysfunctional emotional arousal may use antidepressant treat mood anxiety symptom . Indeed , family history BD among strong risk factor develop disorder emotional arousal youth . Twin family study provide compelling evidence parent BD associate dramatic increase risk offspring 's development disorder emotional arousal compare general population . Moreover , offspring develop dysfunctional emotional arousal , risk develop BD increase even . Antidepressants commonly use treat initial mood presentation ; however , may also accelerate onset dysfunctional emotional arousal high-risk youth . In context , become difficult disentangle natural illness progression antidepressant-related dysfunction lead BD . Thus , significant clinical dilemma regard whether antidepressant prescribe treat youth family history BD , also DSM-5 ( Diagnostic Statistical Manual Mental Disorders ) depressive anxiety disorder .</detailed_description>
