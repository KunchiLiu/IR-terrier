	<brief_title>Dorsal Root Ganglion Stimulation Hand Upper Limb Pain</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Dorsal Root Ganglion ( DRG ) stimulation form Spinal Cord Stimulation ( SCS ) , available use treatment chronic pain Europe since late 2011 . Clinical practice pre/post market study show stimulation DRG significantly reduce chronic intractable pain various aetiology . However , study yet specifically investigate application DRG stimulation treatment chronic pain affect upper limb . Furthermore , study SCS generally , upper limb pain population , despite group often refer treated SCS tertiary , interventional pain practice . Due several limitation traditional SCS system , chiefly concern stability stimulation induce paraesthesia , DRG stimulation increasingly utilised place condition .</detailed_description>
