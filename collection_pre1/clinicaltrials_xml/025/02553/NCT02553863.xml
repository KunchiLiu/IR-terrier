	<brief_title>The Effectiveness Cost-effectiveness Acupuncture Managing Chemotherapy-induced Peripheral Neuropathy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Participants setting : - Patients lung , breast , head &amp; neck , colorectal gynaecological cancer receive taxanes platinum-derivative chemotherapy experience CIPN end cycle one population study . The study take place large cancer centre territory ( Prince Wales Hospital ) . Recruitment : - Potential subject identify ( clinic list databases patient undergo treatment ) approach initially relevant clinical team screen undertaken research staff . The trial run ethically , detail process see additional material . Randomisation : - Patients allocate group computer-generated randomisation do Prince Wales clinical trial unit . Randomisation consist minimisation random element ( stochastic minimisation ) , balance treatment type ( taxanes platinum analogue receive ) ratio 1:1 two group . Intervention : - The acupuncture intervention describe base STRICTA recommendation report acupuncture trial . In acupuncture group , patient receive , addition standard care , standardise 30-minute acupuncture session needle specific body point although flexibility case point puncture ( ie . case lymphoedema ) , alternative point ( routine practice ) may select therapist use discretion maintain equal dose treatment patient . The point standardise accord clinical manifestation subject . Standard care : - The comparison arm standard care control arm . Study duration : - Treatment duration 8 week . The duration patient 's involvement study 20 week ( 5 month ) assessment baseline , end 8-week treatment , 14 week 20 week . Based available number study hospital , recruitment 10 subjects/month , require 11 month trial recruitment . Four month assign trial set , preparation staff training , 5 month follow-up last patient recruit , 4 month data cleaning , analysis report write ( =24 month study ) . Outcome measure : 1 . Functional status Quality Life [ baseline , week 8 , week 14 , week 20 ass change baseline time ] Primary outcome assessment Pain 8-weeks ( end acupuncture treatment ) : Pain : 'worst pain past week ' measure use Brief Pain Inventory measure pain intensity interference function . 2 . Secondary outcome : - The NCI-Common Toxicity Criteria ( CTC ) Adverse Events complete baseline week 8 ass change baseline . This physician base grade system include criterion definition quantify grade CIPN ( neurosensory neuromotor component ) . This grade scale comprises sensory motor assessment utilise 5-point scale range grade 1 grade 5 . Previous study demonstrate CTC scale quick use , easy administer useful carry screening procedure choose patient need neurological examination . - The Total Neuropathy Score clinical version ( TNSc ) complete baseline week 8 ass change baseline.. The TNS combine information obtain grading symptom , sign , nerve conduction study , quantitative sensory test , provide single measure quantify neuropathy . - Functional assessment cancer therapy ( FACT/GOG-Ntx ) complete baseline , week 8 , week 14 , week 20 ass change baseline time . This 38-item self report questionnaire , divide two sub-scales : first one 27-item general assessment quality life sub-scale ( FACT-G ) second one 11-item neurotoxicity sub-scale . This tool demonstrate good internal reliability construct validity . - Consumption analgesic also measure patient diary , well presence relate symptom ( ie . fatigue , sleep , etc ) use 10-item Symptom Distress Scale baseline , week 8 , week 14 , week 20 ass change baseline time ] . 3 . Sensory examination [ baseline end Acupuncture course -8 weeks- ass change baseline ] Sensory examination take place doctor/nurse use 10-g monofilament lightly touch patient 's hand foot bilaterally patient eye close . The monofilament test standardise plastic filament press part hand foot . When filament bend , tip exert pressure 10-gr . Abnormal response include hyperesthesia , anesthesia hypoesthesia record . - Neurophysiological test include detailed motor nerve conduction study follow nerve affect limb . For upper limb , test include : median nerve ( bilateral ) ulnar nerve ( bilateral ) . For low limb , test include peroneal nerve ( bilateral ) , tibial nerve ( bilateral ) . There provision sensitive parameter register axonopathy demyelination . Distal latency , amplitude conduction velocity measure . F-waves also perform . For sensory nerve conduction part , follow nerve study . For upper limb , test include : median nerve ( bilateral ) ulnar nerve ( bilateral ) . For low limb , include sural nerve ( bilateral ) . We anticipate common abnormality reside sensory nerve conduction study axonal derangement common manifestation . Knowing test may cause little bit discomfort participant , participation test voluntary . We expect equal number participant intervention group control group participate testing ( n=25 per group ) . - Sociodemographic treatment characteristic obtain patient ' record patient baseline . Patients ask treatment expectation , much believe method help alleviate pain much faith acupuncture ( 10-point scale ) . As CIPN manage dose reduction clinical practice , chemotherapy dosage documentation ( cumulative dosage receive , dose reduction , dosage cycle , complete number cycle , chemotherapy type ) also collect . The dosage information necessary use data covariate data analysis , dose constant across patient . Adverse effect monitor collected patient researcher clinic visit duration acupuncture treatment . 4 . Measurement cost We explore cost impact data capture frequency , type extent cost service utilisation patient . This do week 14 cover period start treatment week 14 . This first time cost evaluation take place cancer symptom-related acupuncture trial . More specifically , cost identify , measure value use micro-costing approach ( component resource use identify , estimate unit cost derive market price national estimate ) . The cost analysis perform perspective health service provider societal perspective . Included health care provider cost accrue hospital general practitioner . Costs patient family , include social care , consider additional cost society . Indirect cost term workday lose also include . Data collect prospectively retrospectively use questionnaire design University Leeds.multiple source include patient record patient self report questionnaire . The questionnaire determine health service utilisation result CIPN ( e.g . outpatient general practitioner visit ) , patient pocket expense counter medicine transport together use service social sector home help support family friend . Valuation resource item include hospital resource ( e.g . bed day staff time ) community resource ( e.g . general practitioner visit , home help ) use carry use national estimate ; market price assign medication ; non-market item , specifically patient time informal help provide family friend , value use market wage rate ; pocket expense ( e.g . bus fare ) also obtain . We use approach successfully multisite acupressure trial 500 patient Data analysis : - Analyses include descriptive statistic summarise data , analysis variance assess between-groups difference primary secondary outcome , regression analysis ( ANCOVA ) use baseline pain score covariate . 95 % CIs also calculate . In detail , t-test adequate analysis , analysis covariance use baseline pain score covariate centre trial arm grouping factor . Equivalent analysis perform week 20 data ( although acknowledge analysis would independent 14-week score , likely week-14 week-20 value correlate ) . Drop-out case non-respondents ask complete primary outcome scale ( 1-item ) 5 item CTC scale CIPN order capture outcomes many patient possible intention treat analysis , feasible , use data imputation ( LVCF : last value carry forward ) . An intention-to-treat analysis carry .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Patients diagnosis lung cancer receive chemotherapy curative intend , breast gynaecological cancer , head &amp; neck colorectal cancer stage I , II III . Currently receive neurotoxic chemotherapy ( taxanes , cisplatin , ,carboplatin , etc ) Reporting tingle hands/feet indication chemotherapyinduced peripheral neuropathy ( CIPN ) initiation cancer treatment , confirm indicative CIPN consultant . Not use medication prevention treatment CIPN past 31 month Willing participate randomise one study group . No previously establish peripheral neuropathy Exclusion criterion include patient needle phobia ; Patients low platelet count ( &lt; 50,000 ) ; Comorbidity bleed disorder ; Pregnancy , receive acupuncture treatment past three month . In addition , ipsilateral arm patient undergone axillary dissection also exclude needle well lymphoedematous limb .</criteria>
