	<brief_title>Ibrutinib Azacitidine Treatment Higher Risk Myelodysplastic Syndrome</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate safety tolerability ibrutinib combination azacitidine patient high risk myelodysplastic syndrome ( MDS ) determine maximum tolerate dose ( MTD ) recommend Phase 2 dose ibrutinib combine azacitidine . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To early assessment efficacy combination ibrutinib azacitidine high risk MDS . Specific secondary endpoint include : disease response per modify International Working Group ( IWG ) 2006 response criterion MDS , hematologic normalization rate ( HNR = complete remission [ CR ] + partial remission [ PR ] + hematologic improvement [ HI ] ) , overall survival ( OS ) , progression free survival ( PFS ) , disease free survival ( DFS ) , time response ( TTR ) . TERTIARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate pharmacodynamic biological effect impact quality life ( QoL ) combination ibrutinib azacitidine patient high risk MDS exploratory objective study . Exploratory endpoint include : laboratory biomarker analysis effect QoL assessment . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study ibrutinib . Patients receive azacitidine intravenously ( IV ) 10-40 minute subcutaneously ( SC ) daily ( QD ) day 1-7 1-5 8-9 , ibrutinib orally ( PO ) QD day 1-28 . Treatment repeat every 28 day 24 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow every 3 month 6 month .</detailed_description>
