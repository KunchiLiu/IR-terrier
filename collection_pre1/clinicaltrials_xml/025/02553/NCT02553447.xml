	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well cholecalciferol work treat patient newly diagnose non-Hodgkin lymphoma chronic lymphocytic leukemia low level vitamin D ( vitamin D deficiency ) . Cholecalciferol may increase level vitamin D improve survival patient non-Hodgkin lymphoma chronic lymphocytic leukemia receive standard care chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cholecalciferol Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia With Vitamin D Deficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate 3 year progression-free survival ( PFS ) , define time first chemotherapy treatment newly diagnose non-Hodgkin lymphoma ( NHL ) chronic lymphocytic leukemia ( CLL ) relapse , progression , death cause . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To evaluate change level serum vitamin D level therapy daily oral vitamin D supplementation ( cholecalciferol ) . II . To evaluate overall survival ( OS ) , define defined time first chemotherapy treatment newly diagnose NHL CLL administer trial death cause . OUTLINE : Patients low level vitamin D randomize 1 2 arm patient normal level assign Arm III . ARM I : Patients receive high-dose cholecalciferol orally ( PO ) daily 3 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM II : Patients receive low-dose cholecalciferol PO daily 3 year absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM III : Patients receive intervention .</detailed_description>
