	<brief_title>Diagnosis Carpal Tunnel Syndrome : Effectiveness Diagnostic Tests . Clinical Trial Accuracy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) characterize median nerve compression level wrist . It represent 90 % compressive neuropathy common upper member . For major cause disability hand , early accurate diagnosis obtain definitive treatment CTS essential . Despite , consensus effective diagnostic criterion CTS . The absence golden standard , universally accept diagnosis CTS contribute scenario . The CTS diagnostic practice controversial inconsistent large variation clinical presentation sign symptom well performance clinical trial . The clinical diagnosis mainly represent symptom numbness median nerve distribution territory hand positivity provocative test Phalen Tinel vary considerably performance accuracy sensitivity value ( 10-80 % ) specificity ( 55 86 % ) . Ultrasonography ( US ) electromyography ( EMG ) complementary examination often use diagnosis CTS , overestimate performance require caution interpret result , particularly lack consensus ideal cutoff point consider diagnosis CTS . This result wide variation result sensitivity specificity test , EMG ( sensitivity = 82 98 % specificity = 19 88 % ) US ( sensitivity = 70 98 % specificity = 63 100 % ) , addition high proportion ( 20-40 % ) false-negative false-positive . Most diagnostic accuracy study CTS compare result US EMG , consider time EMG standard reference . There study compare result US EMG use benchmark , degree clinical improvement surgical treatment CTS combination clinical sign symptom . The value diagnostic test CTS establish compare diagnostic strategy study affect likelihood STC . This spectrum consider result surgical treatment golden standard , directly relate diagnosis CTS . Surgical treatment classical open surgery definitive treatment CTS provide relief symptom , mainly remission paresthesia , satisfactory result 98 % case . The discomfort cause paresthesia quality life patient impairs daily manual activity quality sleep considerable CTS . The remission paresthesia clinical improvement parameter disease expect relevant outcome patient . Primary well-designed control study good methodological quality guide diagnostic practice evaluate effectiveness integrated manner carpal tunnel syndrome ( CTS ) unusual challenge current literature . This study protocol , innovative method primary objective determine effectiveness clinical examination ( CE ) , ultrasound ( US ) electromyograph ( EMG ) evaluate compare best performance diagnostic accuracy . The study design clinical trial accuracy , primary , longitudinal , control , prospective , perform single center . This clinical trial follow accuracy STARD recommendation ( Standards Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy ) . The diagnostic intervention initial clinical evaluation perform experienced hand surgeon consist medical history application avaliation 6 clinical diagnostic criterion CTS accord Graham et al ( CTS 6 ) : paresthesia , night paresthesia , weakness and/or atrophy thenar musculature , Tinel signal , Phalen test loss 2-points discrimination . The ultrasonography ( US ) wrist patient study group control group consider evaluation diagnostic accuracy , US examination wrist conduct randomly experience reputable origin reason period 6 month prior initial clinical evaluation . If performe US , futher examination require initial clinical evaluation . For diagnosis CTS consider cutoff point value great equal 10.0 mmÂ² diameter median nerve ( direct method ) proximal anatomical limit carpal tunnel wrist STC . The electromyography ( EMG ) upper limb patient study group control group consider evaluation diagnostic accuracy , EMG examination upper limb conduct randomly experience reputable origin reason within six month precede initial clinical evaluation . If perform EMG , examination require initial clinical evaluation . For diagnosis CTS consider cutoff point measure sensory conduction velocity ( second finger-wrist segment ) equal less 50 / STC . After examination US EMG , patient study group shall submit surgical treatment CTS . The surgery ambulatory character , Bier local intravenous anesthetic technique , use xylocaine 1 % without vasoconstrictor intravenous sedation . The surgical technique surgical decompression via classical open surgery carpal tunnel . All patient receive medical discharge day day surgery . During medical discharge process , patient companion give information surgery , postoperative care day time outpatient visit dressing . The first dressing perform one week date surgery stitch remove 2 week . Each patient follow outpatient basis monthly 4th month surgery . The statistical methodology characteristic patient evaluate descriptively . For categorical variable , relative , absolute frequency , numeric variable present summary measure ( mean standard deviation ) . To compare accuracy US EMG McNemar test use . Clinical diagnosis CTS compare US EMG use chi-square test . Will calculate sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value negative two diagnostic group calculate paired sample , use reference standard surgical treatment compare result US EMG . The calculation positive negative predictive value show probability patient CTS result positive ( disease ) negative ( disease ) respectively . The accuracy clinical diagnosis US clinical diagnosis EMG evaluate Kappa coefficient . To compare proportion correct diagnose 2 group chi-square test use . The effectiveness clinical examination shall calculate compare percentage true positive case surgical treatment compare true positive case find clinical examination , US EMG . The summary measure accompany 95 % confidence interval . Will consider p &lt; 0.05 significant . The sample size calculation carry consider difference least 20 % accuracy diagnostic test clinical diagnosis statistical power 84.4 % 5 % significance level . To , total 145 patient CTS divide 115 patient study group 30 patient control group , require . There lack accuracy properly design study good quality evidence recommend good diagnostic practice CTS . This study protocol present innovative proposal conduct clinical trial accuracy , specifically design golden standard define diagnosis CTS , use reference paresthesia surgery relevant outcome standpoint patient . The use accurate diagnostic criterion effective diagnostic protocol clinical examination , US EMG , base high level evidence lead directly paradigm shift clinical decision-making , effective safe CTS treatment .</detailed_description>
