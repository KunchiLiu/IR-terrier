	<brief_title>Exacerbation Self-management COPD : The ACCESS Study</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Rationale : COPD exacerbation considerably affect patient ' health status contribute COPD related cost . Patients often problem recognize respond promptly exacerbation . Tools support patient exacerbation self-management paper exacerbation action plan telemonitoring system show positive result exacerbation relate outcome . However , many patient appear adhere action plan instruction . Besides , exist telemonitoring tool rely heavily input healthcare professional make difficult assess true effect cost effectiveness telemonitoring system . Recently , Radboud University develop `` Adaptive Computerized COPD Exacerbation Self-management Support '' ( ACCESS ) system . This software application integrate objective parameter , spirometry , pulse-oximetry , temperature , self-reported symptom worsen Bayesian network model result weighted exacerbation risk prediction . Patients able monitor give moment . The ACCESS system predict whether exacerbation imminent , also provide ad hoc tailor advice without interference healthcare professional . Objective : In project primary aim ass ( cost- ) effectiveness ACCESS system support exacerbation self-management patient COPD . Study design : A multicenter , pragmatic , two-arm , randomize controlled trial follow-up 12 month per participant . Study population : Patients COPD , &gt; 40 year old , 2 self-reported symptom base exacerbation previous year . Intervention : After short self-management educational session exacerbation , participant randomize either 1 ) exacerbation self-management support use paper exacerbation action plan ( control group ) ; 2 ) exacerbation self-management support use ACCESS system ( intervention group ) . Participants intervention group instruct use ACCESS notice change COPD symptom . Participants control group instruct use paper action plan notice change COPD symptom . Main study parameters/endpoints : Primary aim : increase number exacerbation-free week . Secondary aim : improve exacerbation self-management , exacerbation-management related self-efficacy , quality life . To decrease ER visit , hospital admission COPD related cost .</detailed_description>
