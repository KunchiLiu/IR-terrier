	<detailed_description>This Phase II , open label study involve patient clinical phenotype choroideremia confirm CHM genotype . Following consent , patient require attend initial screen visit ( Visit 1 ) . Within 2 week screen visit patient undergo surgical procedure ( Visit 2 ) general anesthesia include standard vitrectomy , retinal detachment administration subretinal injection AAV2-REP1 ( 1x1011 genome particle ) . Patients require attend 9 study visit ( Visits 3-11 ) 24 month period functional , anatomical assessment well monitor adverse event . The primary endpoint change baseline visual acuity study eye , compare control eye . Secondary study endpoint , change baseline autofluorescence evaluation , microperimetry reading anatomic functional outcome ( study eye compare control eye ) . Secondary endpoint also include safety assessment conduct throughout study . The fellow eye patient utilized control study receive study treatment .</detailed_description>
