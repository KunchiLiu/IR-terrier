	<brief_title>Aqua Therapy Deep Venous Thrombosis Insufficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Post-thrombotic syndrome ( PTS ) develop approximately 25-60 % patient acute low extremity deep venous thrombosis ( DVT ) depend severity , chronicity , anatomic level involvement efficacy anticoagulation.The frequency increase occlusive iliac venous thrombosis . PTS result significant morbidity stagger toll health careresources . PTS reduce early percutaneous endovenous intervention administration new oral anticoagulant . There conflict result efficacy compression stocking . In general , exercise useful activation muscle pump improvement symptom . There data exercise swimming pool . Both walk swimming reduce effect joint contact therefore pain particularly useful patient arthritis heavyweight . Furthermore less effect gravity , absorption edema would faster . There data role water activity reduction measure venous insufficiency.The purpose study ass whether encouragement patient perform aqua activity beyond recommended treatment would positively impact chronic venous insufficiency .</detailed_description>
