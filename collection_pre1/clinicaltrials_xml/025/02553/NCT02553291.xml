	<brief_summary>HIV fatal diagnosis , due treatment advance longer death sentence . Today , HIV-infected adult face new challenge health ; develop cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) earlier frequently HIV-infected . Reasons include toxic effect HIV medication activation immune system . Preventing cardiovascular disease HIV-infected adult help live healthy life ; however , lack evidence help u achieve goal . Exercise prevent cardiovascular disease , often address HIV care , due , part , lack practical intervention target population . This study address problem test intervention improve maintain exercise HIV-infected adult . This study examine impact innovative sustainable intervention , adapt unique medical psychosocial need HIV-infected adult , call SystemCHANGE-HIV . It consist six session help redesign individual 's environment routine increase exercise.This randomized trial half subject participate intervention half participate control condition . Measures include assessment exercise , fitness , marker cardiovascular health intervention see , , change .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Emerging evidence suggest HIV infection associate 1.5-2-fold high risk cardiovascular disease . This may due , part , increase cardiometabolic risk factor relate toxic effect HIV medication , immune activation , chronic inflammation . Interventions prevent cardiovascular disease , account unique medical psychosocial need HIV-infected adult , need . Exercise show improve cardiometabolic risk decrease cardiovascular disease . It show improve cardiometabolic risk factor group HIV-infected adult brief intensely supervise trial . However , sustain exercise population practical scalable intervention implement home setting ( i.e. , free-living exercise ) unknown . The purpose test novel , evidence-based intervention , SystemCHANGE-HIV , hold promise improving exercise HIV-infected adult . SystemCHANGE-HIV new behavior-change program base system re-design model , individual 's daily routine compose set habit ( behavior ) change . The intervention engage participant series self-designed experiment test way change behavior . The program involve six weekly group session teach behavior-changing exercise-improvement strategy , follow monthly telephone booster session encourage maintenance beneficial effect . SystemCHANGE significantly improve exercise adherence cardiovascular risk factor HIV-uninfected adult . The specific aim study ( 1 ) evaluate 3-month 6-month effect SystemCHANGE-HIV amount intensity free-living exercise , ( 2 ) describe impact SystemCHANGE-HIV fitness ( VO2 max ) cardiometabolic health . To accomplish aim , longitudinal , randomize control trial ( n=105 ) compare effect SystemCHANGE-HIV attention-control condition . The outcome assess efficacy use biological behavioral evaluation include : actigraphy , fitness assessment , clinical laboratory assessment .</detailed_description>
