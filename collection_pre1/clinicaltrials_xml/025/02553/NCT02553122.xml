	<brief_title>The Combined Efficacy Evicel Tranexamic Acid Total Knee Arthroplasty</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Background : Total knee arthroplasty characterize large amount postoperative blood loss frequent need blood transfusions.1 Also concern risk hematoma potentially lead infection wound complication delay overall rehabilitation process.2 By reduce postoperative bleeding , outcomes total knee arthroplasty would improve good range motion , less frequency blood transfusion decrease incidence arthrofibrosis.3 Several study look different blood conservation strategy include reinfusion drain , tourniquet , autologous blood transfusion , topical intravenous antifibrinolytic alone , topical fibrin sealant alone , monopolar bipolar electrocautery . The combined use topical fibrin sealant ( Evicel® ) antifibrinolytic ( Tranexamic acid ) represent another approach reduce blood loss patient undergoing total knee arthroplasty . Evicel® fibrin sealant consist human-derived thrombin fibrinogen work combination form stable blood clot bleed site . Evicel® regularly use orthopaedic sub-specialty surgery . One investigation report use topical hemostatic agent total knee arthroplasty.4 It compare use fibrin sealant hemostasis standard hemostasis protocol find topical hemostatic agent decrease post operative blood loss , increase post operative hemoglobin level , result decrease need post operative blood transfusion . Tranexamic Acid give topically intravenously occlude fibrin cleavage site plasminogen inhibit breakdown fibrin clot . Tranexamic acid also regularly use orthopaedic sub-specialty surgery . Studies find intravenous dose tranexamic acid prior incision , tourniquet release reduces need blood transfusion versus standard hemostasis.5 , 6 Research Questions/Objectives : Does combination use fibrin sealant antifibrinolytic institutional total knee arthroplasty protocol decrease postoperative drain output/hematocrit drop/hemoglobin drop need post operative blood transfusion compare standard hemostasis technique ? Secondary objective measure difference postoperative pain , postoperative range motion , rate postoperative complication include pulmonary embolism , deep vein thrombosis , wound complication require return operate room treatment control group . Study Design : The null hypothesis state combine use topical fibrin sealant antifibrinolytic total knee arthroplasty show difference amount postoperative blood loss compare standard mean hemostasis ( tourniquet electrocauterization ) . The study prospective randomize trial patient undergo elective primary , unilateral , cemented total knee arthroplasty . Patients randomly divide two group . A control group , standard mean hemostasis apply treatment group , standard mean hemostasis apply additional use Evicel® ( fibrin sealant ) Tranexamic acid ( antifibrinolytic ) . All operation standardize four surgeon . Subjects : The target population patient see outpatient office indicate primary total knee arthroplasty . Patients ask would like participate study ; patient capable consent surgery enrol . Patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty revision patient blood disorder , chronic anti-thrombotic medication Coumadin patient history deep vein thrombosis and/or pulmonary embolism exclude . Despite Evicel® contains human-derived blood product , Jehovah 's Witnesses exclude patient give opportunity whether would like participate . As tranexamic acid renally clear , renally impaired individual exclude . Study Procedures : All participate surgeon adhere protocol . Upon enrol study , patient demographic include age , gender , height , weight record store encrypt , protected database . Eligible / consent patient randomize 1:1 ratio receive either treatment non-treatment . The randomization stratify surgeon ensure balanced assignment treatment / non-treatment participating surgeon . Randomization schemes generate maintain Dr. David Leibelt , study statistician . Dr. Leibelt provide Mr. Bharat Tiwari set randomization envelope store use study clinic . Mr. Tiwari assign envelop sequential order , envelope number surgeon , eligible /consenting patient . . During process , Dr. Jason Wong Mr. Andrew Schwartz blind access randomization assignment . Preoperative blood work include hematocrit hemoglobin perform , standard patient undergoing joint arthroplasty . On day surgery , patient see preoperative hold area , ask consent take part study . Total knee arthroplasty perform standard medial parapatellar approach use 350 mm Hg pneumatic tourniquet operative leg . All surgeon use Zimmer implant . After patient put sleep , attend surgeon inform operate team whether patient randomize treatment control group . If patient part treatment group , receive 10 mg/kg dose tranexamic acid prior tourniquet inflation . After removal trial implant irrigation/thorough drying , 2 mL Evicel® spray ( 15-25 psi CO2 ) posterior joint capsule ( via gap femur tibia ) . Once implant place methylmethacrylate cement cure , joint irrigate copiously dry thoroughly final time . 2 mL Evicel® drip pinhole , another 2 mL Evicel® drip along expose edge bony tissue , additional 2 mL Evicel® spray remain soft tissue . After 2 minute , tourniquet release second dose 10 mg/kg tranexamic acid give electrocautery perform . After joint capsule closure , final 2 mL Evicel® spray along arthrotomy incision subcutaneous soft tissue . On top treatment protocol mention , patient also receive standard tourniquet protocol electrocautery . If patient control group , standard tourniquet protocol electrocautery alone use hemostasis . In group , auto transfusion drain place within deep layer knee . The joint close dressed standard fashion . The patient take postoperative anesthesia care unit . Immediate postoperative hemoglobin hematocrit level record , standard practice institution . The drain output record 24-hour period . As standard , hemoglobin hematocrit level record three day postoperatively . Any transfusion and/or complication ( pulmonary embolism , deep vein thrombosis , wound complication require return operate room ) length stay monitor ( accord standard protocol ) record . Pain score utilizing WOMAC , SF-36 , VAS scale record postoperative follow clinic . Range motion compare preoperative value two six week postoperatively . Safety outcomes monitor Potential complication associate study pulmonary embolism , deep vein thrombosis , wound complication require return operating room monitor surgical team . Risks Benefits Potential benefit include decrease perioperative blood loss , would sequentially decrease chance blood transfusion ( low cost , few infection error , less frequent seroconversion ) decrease pain secondary joint hematoma . This study also aim eliminate need post-operative drain usage ( low cost , few infection , few drain complication less time operate room ) . Evicel consist human-derived thrombin fibrinogen . Patients known allergy human blood product participate study . Also , human-derived blood product carry risk transmit infectious agent viruses theoretically , Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease ( CJD ) agent . This risk theoretically equal risk blood transfusion ; however , NO known incident infectious agent transmit use Evicel . Evicel FDA approve routinely use orthopaedic surgery . Tranexamic acid pro-coagulant molecule use patient past medical history intravascular clotting . Dosing tranexamic acid reduce renally impaired patient . The compound also avoid known allergy tranexamic acid . Tranexamic acid FDA approve routinely use variety surgery , include orthopaedics Data Safety Monitoring Plan A data safety monitor board consist independent physician , Dr. Tony Wanich , Mr. Bharat Tiwari Dr.Yungtai Lo . At 50 100 patient mark , board decide base follow criterion decide whether study continue : 1. whether complication rate ( include deep vein thrombosis , cerebrovascular accident ) treatment group control group significantly different 2. whether transfusion rate treatment group control group significantly different 3. whether drain output treatment group control group significant different If criterion meet , board inform principle investigator decide whether study terminate early . Data Management Analysis : Measures : The primary outcome measure 24-hour drain output measure time introduce . Secondary measure serum hemoglobin hematocrit level measure approximately 2 week prior surgery first three day surgery . Transfusions throughout duration stay length hospital stay also record . Scores obtain 3 pain scale record : WOMAC ( Pre-op Post-op 6 month ) , SF-36 ( Pre-op Post-op 6 month ) , VAS ( Pre-op , Post-op day # 1 , 2 , 3 , Post-op visit # 1 2 ) . Range motion two six week postoperatively compare preoperative range . All measurement record encrypt protected database . Statistical Analysis : The primary ( drain output ) secondary ( hemoglobin/hematocrit ) outcomes continuous variable . Values intervention ( Evicel®/Tranexamic acid ) standard care control group compare Mann-Whitney test . Results individual day measure summary measure ( total drainage average hemoglobin/hematocrit ) adjust multiple comparison . However , statistically significant result different day measure composite measure consistent , possibility type I error emphasize . We assume data normally distribute therefore non-parametric test , Mann Whitney test , perform . We expect randomization result balance study group regard characteristic like age , sex , race , BMI . Therefore stratify randomization unnecessary . However , two study arm reasonably balance , additional analysis use linear regression adjust unbalanced variable perform . Intention treat analysis perform . Statistical analysis complete Dr. Jason Wong medical student , Andrew Schwartz . Both Dr. Wong Mr. Schwartz blind randomization . Sample Size : Based previous study look similar outcome use conservative estimate true difference mean drain output , need 50 patient per group 90 % power 150 patient per group 97 % power detect difference 24 hour drain output . Implementation Plan/Timetable : Patients see office , indicate total knee arthroplasty , request consent study . The attend surgeon answer question time . A physician assistant blind collect data daily . An average 15-20 total knee arthroplasty do week . The data collection likely take 3-6 month . The data collect kept encrypt protected database accessible physician care patient enrol study .</detailed_description>
