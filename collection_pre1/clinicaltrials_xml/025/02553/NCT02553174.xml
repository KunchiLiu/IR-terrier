	<brief_summary>The study investigate role NSAIDs development AKI patient undergo high-risk abdominal thoracic surgery . The investigator hypothesize use new urinary biomarkers allow early detection AKI current gold standard , i.e . change serum creatinine and/or urine output .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>AKI Thoracic Abdominal Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This study design prospective observational trial . After obtain Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approval , patient recruit consented Anesthesia Pre-Operative Clinic . On day surgery , baseline urine sample obtain initial insertion Foley catheter , induction anesthesia . Urine sample also collect Foley catheter immediate post-operative period shortly patient admit Intensive Care Unit ( ICU ) . Urine sample continue collect 72 hour post-operatively , 0600 ( 6am ) 1800 ( 6pm ) day indwell Foley catheter , standard care ICU . Urine sample label stored per instruction provide commercially available kit ; six urine sample total collect stored per patient . The electronic medical record ( EMR ) review determine whether patient receive ketorolac , ibuprofen , NSAIDs intra-operatively postoperatively ( within 72 hour begin surgery ) . Daily serum creatinine measurement hourly urine output , standard care ICU , obtain EMR well . AKI diagnose stag accord KDIGO criterion , base change creatinine urine output . In patient `` KDIGO-diagnosed AKI '' match non-AKI group , also compare time course new urinary biomarkers , include limited uNGAL , serum creatinine urine output . We match patient accord demographic well clinical characteristic , include co-morbidities , type surgery anesthesia technique . Comparing time course current clinical marker ( serum creatinine urine output ) new urinary biomarkers allow u assess role guide future preventive intervention .</detailed_description>
