	<brief_summary>Patients take thyroid hormone replacement thyroid removal surgery often report feel differently prior take thyroid hormone . The symptom include fatigue , worsen mood subjective `` brain fog '' patient feel like think sharp previously . Multiple study find patient take thyroid hormone replacement diminish quality life compare matched control . Previous study suggest type deiodinase ( DIO ) polymorphism patient , responsible convert thyroid hormone T4 biologically active T3 , may contribute overall cognition sense well-being . The Investigators aim determine type deiodinase polymorphism patient contribute patient 's cognition overall sense well-being surgery thyroid hormone replacement . Objective : Determine patient deiodinase type 2 CC polymorphism objective difference work memory ( N-back test primary endpoint ) , cognitive function sense well-being thyroidectomy place standard thyroid hormone replacement therapy . Hypotheses : ( 1 ) Patients deiodinase type 2 CC polymorphism bad work memory ( N-back test primary endpoint ) , cognitive function sense well-being standard thyroid hormone replacement therapy thyroidectomy compare thyroidectomy . ( 2 ) Patients deiodinase type 2 TT TC polymorphism difference work memory , cognitive function sense well-being standard thyroid hormone replacement thyroidectomy .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Is Levothyroxine Alone Adequate Thyroid Hormone Replacement ?</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>STUDY DESIGN Many patient undergo thyroidectomy nodular thyroid disease . They normal thyroid function prior surgery immediately place standard thyroid hormone replacement therapy ( levothyroxine , LT4 ) surgery . The levothyroxine dose titrate every 6-8 week normalize thyroid stimulate hormone ( TSH ) level . The investigator aim study population surgery patient still endogenous thyroid function surgery TSH normalize pre-surgery level . Using weight base dose strategy ( 1.6mcg/kg ) , patient remain euthyroid throughout process . This experimental design eliminate many confound variable plague previous thyroid replacement trial . One difficult aspect conduct type study test uniform patient population . The common cause hypothyroidism autoimmune thyroiditis ( Hashimoto 's thyroiditis ) previous study largely focus patient . The difficulty test patient autoimmune thyroid failure even though common illness , disease course extremely variable . Each patient may different degree thyroid failure may still make different amount endogenous thyroid hormone . The presence thyroid autoantibody also report systemic effect , may influence perception overall health sense well-being . This study focus homogenous population without potential cofounder inherent patient autoimmune thyroid disease . Each patient serve control also avoid cognitive somatic effect temporary hypothyroidism may induce . No study ever evaluate patient 's symptoms replacement thyroid hormone patient euthyroid thyroid hormone therapy . The assumption make serum TSH normalize , thyroid hormone level adequate symptom hypothyroidism relieve . The investigator know large community base study symptoms hypothyroidism persist despite investigator believe `` adequate '' thyroid hormone replacement many 10 % patient . Our study first test patient , thyroidectomy investigator directly compare normal endogenous thyroid function levothyroxine ( LT4 ) therapy result serum TSH . Thyroidectomies often perform large nodule nodule show indeterminate suspicious cytology fine needle aspiration biopsy , turn benign final histological diagnosis . The current standard care replace thyroid hormone LT4 normalize serum TSH . Our approach use patient control eliminate numerous variable control study include : variable onset hypothyroidism , degree endogenous thyroid function underlie cause hypothyroidism . Prior surgery , investigator measure patient 's thyroid level ( TSH , free T4 , total T4 , total T3 , thyroxine binding globulin , sex hormone bind globulin , lipid panel , iron ) , parathyroid/calcium function ( parathyroid hormone , calcium , albumin , vitamin D25 ) , deiodinase type 2 polymorphism status determine pre-surgery bloodwork . Thyronamine level also measure surgery . Thyronamines thyronergic metabolite thyroid hormone decrease metabolism induce behavioral inactivity mouse model . A recently develop sensitive chemiluminescent antibody assay 3-Iodothyronamine developed patient levothyroxine therapy thyroidectomy high thyronamine level compare euthyroid control . Based study , investigator hypothesize , secondary measure patient higher thyronamine level surgery , great pre- v post-surgery thyronamine level bad outcome , define questionnaire . Patients complete series questionnaire ( SF-36 measure overall health , Billewicz measure thyroid health , HADS measure anxiety depression ) well undergo work memory test use N-back cognitive function test use Sustained Attention Response Test ( SART ) . Lab analysis also perform surgery look target thyroid hormone action include low density lipoprotein ( LDL ) cholesterol sex hormone bind globulin ( SHBG ) . Following surgery , patient evidence thyroid cancer patient incidental , clinically indolent thyroid cancer require radioiodine therapy TSH suppression continue study . The patient continue study dose levothyroxine titrate goal match pre-surgery TSH +/- 1 milli-international unit per liter ( mIU/L ) . 6 month follow surgery , lab testing , questionnaires cognitive testing repeat . Timing second set test 6 month allow adequate time match post-surgery TSH pre-surgery level give adequate time cognitive effect result surgery dissipate . The primary endpoint compare change score N-back test surgery deiodinase CC polymorphism group deiodinase type 2 TC TT group . Secondary endpoint include score SART well-being questionnaire surgery correlate deiodinase polymorphisms well correlation outcome measure serum thyronamine level surgery exploratory measure .</detailed_description>
