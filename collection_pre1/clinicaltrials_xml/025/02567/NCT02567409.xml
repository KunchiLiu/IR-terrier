	<brief_summary>This randomized phase II trial study well cisplatin gemcitabine hydrochloride without ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 work treat patient urothelial cancer spread place body . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin gemcitabine hydrochloride , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . It yet know cisplatin gemcitabine hydrochloride work well alone ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 treating patient urothelial cancer .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Cisplatin Gemcitabine Hydrochloride With Without ATR Kinase Inhibitor VX-970 Treating Patients With Metastatic Urothelial Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine addition ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 ( VX-970 ) cisplatin/gemcitabine hydrochloride ( gemcitabine ) improve progression-free survival ( PFS ) relative cisplatin/gemcitabine alone . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To compare overall survival ( OS ) addition VX-970 cisplatin/gemcitabine relative cisplatin/gemcitabine alone . II . To compare tumor response rate addition VX-970 cisplatin/gemcitabine relative cisplatin/gemcitabine alone . III . To compare safety addition VX-970 cisplatin/gemcitabine relative cisplatin/gemcitabine alone . IV . To assess role p53 status predict response VX-970-based therapy . OUTLINE : Patients randomize 1 2 arm . ARM A : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously ( IV ) 30 minute day 1 8 , cisplatin IV 60 minute day 1 . Patients also receive ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 IV 60 minute day 2 9 . Treatment repeat every 21 day 6 course absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . ARM B : Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride cisplatin Arm A . After completion study treatment , patient follow 36 month .</detailed_description>
