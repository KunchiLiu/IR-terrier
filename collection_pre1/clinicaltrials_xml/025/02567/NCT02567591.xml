	<brief_summary>Physical exercise identify major beneficial factor management patient suffer many chronic disease especially cancer context cardiac pulmonary transplantation . It contribute improvement quality life decrease treatment side effect mortality . Aerobic fitness constantly alter cirrhotic patient correlate severity hepatic disease . Moreover , set , etiological factor may add like chronic obstructive bronchitis alcoholic cardiomyopathy . In population , muscle abnormality fatigue cramp describe . Muscle weakness condition may comparable described patient chronic obstructive bronchitis contributes decrease aerobic fitness . Different cause muscle deconditioning , hypoxemia , denutrition , anti-rejection drug increase phenomenon liver transplantation . Finally , aerobic capacity VO2max prognostic factor survival link number length hospitalization liver transplantation ( LT ) . Therefore , physical activity valid relevant way improve quality life , increase survival , limit cost hospitalization . The aim study assess effect personalize physical activity retrain program aerobic capacity , strength fatigue , population await liver transplantation . Purpose : The hypothesis home adapt retrain program conduct LT , include physical activity ( aerobic strength training ) , improve aerobic fitness , peripheral strength , quality life decrease hospitalization length intensive care unit LT .</brief_summary>
