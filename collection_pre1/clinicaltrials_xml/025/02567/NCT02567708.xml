	<brief_summary>This study multi-centre , randomise , double-blind , placebo-controlled ( rescue medication ) , two period crossover study subject persistent uncontrolled asthma , currently treat inhale corticosteroid ( ICS ) long act beta 2 agonist ( LABA ) . This study first administration GSK2269557 asthmatic subject , aim study investigate efficacy , safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics four week treatment orally inhale GSK2269557 1000 microgram ( mcg ) subject persistent uncontrolled asthma . In sub-study , biological mediator measure induced sputum blood . Approximately 50 subject randomise study ( include approximately 16 subject sputum sub-study ) . Each subject complete two treatment period : subject randomise receive GSK2269557 1000 mcg one treatment period , match placebo treatment period . Each treatment administer daily 28 day ( +/- 2 day ) via DISKUSâ„¢ dry powder inhaler ( DPI ) . The study consist Screening Visit ; Run-in Period ( approximately 2 week duration ) ; two 28-day Treatment Periods ( 4 clinic visit ) ; 4-week Washout Period ( Treatment Periods ) ; Follow-up Visit . The total duration study subject approximately 16 week . DISKUS register trademark GlaxoSmithKline group company .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Between 18 70 year age inclusive , time signing informed consent . Documented history bronchial asthma , first diagnose least 6 month prior screen visit currently treat intermittent short act beta 2 agonist ( SABA ) noncorticosteroid controller . Non corticosteroid controller ( e.g . leukotriene receptor antagonist [ LTRAs ] ) must discontinue Screening end Treatment Period 2 . Able replace current SABA treatment salbutamol meter dose inhaler ( MDI ) Screening use need duration study . Judged capable withhold salbutamol least 4 hour prior FEV1 assessment . No use ICS LABA least 12 week prior first dose study medication . A best prebronchodilator FEV1 &gt; =60 percent ( % ) predict normal value screen . FEV1 increase &gt; =12 % &gt; =200 milliliter ( mL ) baseline value within 1040 minute inhalation 400 mcg salbutamol MDI ( spacer device may use require ) . Positive skin prick test common aeroallergen ( ) screening ( historical ) . Sputum substudy : Able produce &gt; 100 milligram ( mg ) sputum screen runin period . Body weight &gt; =45 kilogram ( kg ) body mass index ( BMI ) within range 1832 kilogram per meter square ( kg/m^2 ) ( inclusive ) . Male subject : Male subject female partner child bear potential must comply follow contraception requirement first dose study medication completion followup visit . 1 . Vasectomy documentation azoospermia . 2 . Male condom plus partner use one contraceptive option : Contraceptive subdermal implant &lt; 1 % rate failure per year , state product label ; Intrauterine device intrauterine system &lt; 1 % rate failure per year , state product label ; Oral contraceptive , either combined progestogen alone , injectable progestogen ; Contraceptive vaginal ring ; Percutaneous contraceptive patch . Female subject : eligible participate pregnant ( confirm negative urine human chorionic gonadotrophin [ hCG ] test ) , lactate , least one follow condition applies : 1 . Nonreproductive potential define premenopausal female one following : Documented tubal ligation Documented hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure followup confirmation bilateral tubal occlusion Hysterectomy Documented bilateral oophorectomy ; Postmenopausal define 12 month spontaneous amenorrhea ( questionable case blood sample simultaneous follicle stimulate hormone [ FSH ] estradiol level consistent menopause [ refer laboratory reference range confirmatory level ] ) . Females hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) whose menopausal status doubt require use one highly effective contraception method wish continue HRT study . Otherwise , must discontinue HRT allow confirmation postmenopausal status prior study enrolment . 2 . Reproductive potential agrees follow one option list GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) modify list highly effective method avoid pregnancy female reproductive potential ( FRP ) requirement 30 day prior first dose study medication completion followup visit . Contraceptive subdermal implant meet effectiveness criterion include &lt; 1 % rate failure per year , state product label ; Intrauterine device intrauterine system meet effectiveness criterion include &lt; 1 % rate failure per year , state product label ; Oral contraceptive , either combined progestogen alone ; Injectable progestogen ; Contraceptive vaginal ring ; Percutaneous contraceptive patch ; Male partner sterilization documentation azoospermia prior female subject 's entry study , male sole partner subject ; Male condom combine vaginal spermicide ( foam , gel , film , cream , suppository ) . This list apply FRP sex partner , prefer usual lifestyle subject continue abstinent penilevaginal intercourse long term persistent basis . These allow method contraception effective use consistently , correctly accordance product label . The investigator responsible ensure subject understand properly use method contraception . Capable give sign informed consent describe protocol include compliance requirement restriction list consent form protocol . The informed consent must sign prior study related procedure , include change asthma medication . History lifethreatening asthma , define asthma episode require intubation and/or associate hypercapnoea , respiratory arrest and/or hypoxic seizure . Any severe asthma exacerbation , define deterioration asthma require use systemic corticosteroid ( oral , parenteral depot ) within 12 week screen , inpatient hospitalisation emergency department visit due asthma require systemic corticosteroid within 6 month screen . Respiratory Infection : culturedocumented suspect bacterial viral infection upper low respiratory tract , sinus middle ear resolve within 4 week screen lead change asthma management , opinion investigator , expect affect subject 's asthma status subject 's ability participate study . Concurrent Respiratory Disease : current evidence pneumonia , pneumothorax , atelectasis , pulmonary fibrotic disease , bronchopulmonary dysplasia , chronic bronchitis , emphysema , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , lung cancer , respiratory abnormality asthma . Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) &gt; 2x upper limit normal ( ULN ) bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN ( isolated bilirubin &gt; 1.5xULN acceptable bilirubin fractionate direct bilirubin &lt; 35 % ) . Current chronic history liver disease , know hepatic biliary abnormality ( exception Gilbert 's syndrome asymptomatic gallstone ) . QTc &gt; 450 millisecond ( msec ) QTc &gt; 480 msec subject bundle branch block . Other laboratory abnormality concurrent diseases/clinical : clinically significant laboratory abnormality , uncontrolled condition disease state , opinion investigator ( consultation GSK Medical Monitor , require ) , would put safety subject risk study participation would confound interpretation efficacy result condition/disease exacerbate study . Use prohibit medication list protocol . Current smoker subject history smoking within 6 month screen , total pack year history &gt; 5 pack year . History regular alcohol consumption within 6 month study define average weekly intake &gt; 21 unit male &gt; 14 unit female .
