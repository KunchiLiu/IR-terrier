	<brief_title>Talazoparib Treating Patients With Advanced Metastatic Solid Tumors That Can Be Removed Surgery Liver Kidney Dysfunction</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I . To determine safety , tolerability recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) talazoparib patient vary degree hepatic renal dysfunction . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . To observe preliminary antitumor activity talazoparib patient cancer commonly harbor defect homologous recombination repair . II . To assess pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile talazoparib patient vary degree hepatic renal dysfunction . III . To evaluate pharmacodynamic ( PD ) effect talazoparib . IV . To evaluate biomarkers associate response resistance talazoparib . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study . Patients assign 1 6 cohort base degree hepatic renal dysfunction . Patients receive talazoparib orally ( PO ) daily ( QD ) day 1-28 . Courses repeat every 28 day absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 4 week .</detailed_description>
