	<brief_summary>Inadequate food fluid intake common problem among nursing home ( NH ) resident one lead under-nutrition , dehydration , weight loss , hospitalization , even death . The common nutrition intervention at-risk NH resident oral liquid nutrition supplementation , although , limit control evidence efficacy supplement promote weight gain NH resident . Moreover , study show supplement provide consistent order resident receive little staff assistance promote consumption daily NH care practice . The result nutritionally at-risk NH resident supplement order receive additional daily calorie supplement . Recent evidence strongly suggest offer resident choice among variety food fluids multiple time per day meal couple assistance effective increase daily caloric intake promote weight gain . However , provision between-meal choice intervention require significantly staff time relative amount time NH staff currently spend between-meal nutritional care provision . A new federal regulation allow NHs train non-nursing staff provide feed assistance care . Preliminary research demonstrate non-nursing staff train `` feeding assistant '' provide mealtime feed assistance care comparable well indigenous nurse aide counterpart . Moreover , recent demonstration project show staff use effectively augment nurse aide staff mealtime feed assistance care provision daily care practice . The propose translational study utilize federal regulation train non-nursing staff between-meal nutritional care delivery . Specifically , propose study use control , intervention design determine cost-effectiveness between-meal choice intervention relative usual care control group group 200 resident across 4 NH site . Residents order caloric supplementation include study randomize either usual care control group choice intervention group ( 100 resident per group ) . The usual care control group continue receive standard NH care supplement snack delivery meal , provide indigenous nurse aide staff . Non-nursing staff train `` feeding assistant '' offer resident intervention group choice supplement snack food fluid twice daily , five day per week , 24 week also provide standardize prompt protocol enhance intake independence eat . Research staff independently document cost intervention implementation compare cost effectiveness measure include improvement caloric intake , weight quality life . These outcome independently monitor group across 24 study week train research staff use standardize , validated protocol . This translational research effort provide critical information improve care practice nurse home nutritionally risk resident .</brief_summary>
