	<detailed_description>OVERALL AIM AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS The overall aim project adapt DBI implementable large scale mean interactive group work online , new method easily effectively train program facilitator ) , recruitment use model social medium ( e.g. , various website , collaborative project , blog popular among youth ) , evaluate effect adapt version DBI . The program remain interactive , effect probably maintain time high degree implement original format , booster session easily include major problem term logistics , meeting , allocation participant , etc . The new format also provide framework recruitment reduces risk stigmatization . Research question 1 . How effective Internet-based DBI , immediately intervention 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month later , reduce onset eat disorder ? 2 . What channels Internet / social medium lead best recruitment target group ? 3 . Can use implementation Internet-based DBI maintain collaborative project ( e.g. , Wikipreventia ) principles method implementation ( train facilitator recruitment , implementation evaluation ) describe , facilitate , experience accumulate ? 4 . Is adapted DBI cost-effective ? 5 . Secondary question concern new format 's potential engaging participant booster session , degree stigma recruitment , mediator moderator outcome , subgroup analysis . STUDY DESIGN , MATERIAL AND METHODS Study Design The DBI adapt widely implement deliver via Internet mobile `` app '' , maintain interactivity underlying principle theory . An initial evaluation model , although simpler format propose , show promising result . In randomized trial , total least 400 girl age 15-18 self-reported high level body dissatisfaction establish risk factor development eat disorder randomize three group : 1 . Internet-based DBI , consist four interactive occasion , homework assignment , monitoring , 2 . Expressive Writing ( placebo/attention control ) , 3 . A wait-list control condition . Those wait-list condition randomize one active intervention soon do 6-month follow-up assessment . Direct long-term effect intervention ( 6 , 12 , 18 , 24 month post-intervention ) investigate systematic measurement . Study population sample size Following ethical guideline Swedish Research Council , inform consent obtain , initial assessment ( telephone interview ) conduct . Those meet diagnostic criterion eat disorder , body dysmorphic disorder , serious condition require psychiatric care exclude . A booster session available every six month . With effect size d=.32 DBI active control condition regard main outcome variable ( eat disorder pathology ) , three condition total , least 3 measurement ( pre , post 6-months follow-up ) investigator need least 260 participant p &lt; .05 , expect drop-out 15 % , reliability measure set .75 .95 attain power least .95 . Given recruitment channel , investigator expect much large number 260 participate study , ensure adequate power analysis use random effect take drop-out time consideration investigator aim least 400 participant . Procedure Participants recruit note different social medium website project link different forum know engage adolescent girl . After obtain informed consent , participant ask download `` app '' use study . Participants ask respond set questionnaire ( pre-intervention assessment ) use secure plattform , interview . They ask await feedback , include allocation group . Participants significantly high score measure depressive symptomatology potential diagnosis dysmorphophobia , eat disorder advise seek professional help , receive guidance . The rest participant randomize study arm . They receive information participation use app . The first session initiate facilitator introduce basic issue body image thin ideal . The day , hour meeting , participant would receive reminder . The session one hour long . The facilitator guide participant content session follow write manual . Participants miss session ask listen record session ahead next session , briefly discus facilitator . Those randomized Expressive Writing condition ask reflect upon issue relate body image self-concept accord manual . Participants ask respond post-intervention assessment battery end fourth session . They also invite participate booster session provide end intervention , respond follow-up assessment .</detailed_description>
