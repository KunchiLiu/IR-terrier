	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate physiologic effect pulmonary tissue/structural change associate COPD upper airway inflammation upper airway collapsibility . Upper airway collapsibility closely associate development obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) , common disease characterize repetitive collapse upper airway sleep , lead hypoxemia arousal . OSA important neurocognitive cardiovascular consequence , especially patient COPD . Participants research study undergo two overnight sleep study ( PSGs ) , pulmonary function test , CT scan upper airway chest . The first sleep study evaluate sleep breathe disorder second sleep study measure upper airway collapsibility , call critical closing pressure ( Pcrit ) . Pcrit measure modify continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) machine provide wide range pressure 20 -20 cmH2O order modify upper airway pressure .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This physiologic study ass effect low airway lung tissue change COPD upper airway collapsibility . Increased lung volume destruction alveolar wall COPD may opposite various effect upper airway collapsibility , important factor OSA development . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( COPD ) obstructive sleep apnea ( OSA ) common disorder associate considerable morbidity , mortality , healthcare cost . The prevalence co-existing condition estimate ~4 % general population . This COPD-OSA `` overlap '' syndrome cause severe hypoxemia either COPD OSA alone important clinical consequence , include death . COPD usually exclude OSA research OSA typically exclude assessed study COPD ; thus , available information `` overlap '' syndrome limit . Therefore , important identify patient COPD OSA determine mechanism poor outcome patient order optimize therapy . The pathophysiology COPD-OSA syndrome well understood . The investigator propose investigate upper airway ( UA ) anatomic characteristic collapsibility potential underlying mechanism may help explain negative additive effect condition . The objective study CT measure airway anatomy critical closing pressure upper airway ( Pcrit ) , gold standard measure upper airway collapsibility , patient COPD-OSA compare COPD normal control . CT scan upper airway chest allow precise measure upper airway characteristic COPD associate alveolar low airway ch . angesMeasures upper airway collapsibility provide u information mechanical nature airway patient likely OSA . Subjects COPD-OSA may exhibit upper airway inflammation possibly due pre-existing COPD disease reoccurring open close upper airway due OSA . Therefore investigator would like assess degree inflammation patient compare normal control .</detailed_description>
