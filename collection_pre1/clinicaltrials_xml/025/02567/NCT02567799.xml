	<detailed_description>This open-label , single-arm , ascend dose Phase I/II study BIO 300 Oral Suspension give combination paclitaxel/carboplatin radiotherapy subject stage II , III , IV NSCLC candidate combine chemoradiotherapy . A minimum 6 subject accrue sequentially dose level BIO 300 . BIO 300 administered daily entire course concurrent chemoradiotherapy , minimum 6 week ; combination standard paclitaxel / carboplatin chemotherapy radiotherapy . The initial dose BIO 300 administer Day 1 , Visit 2 data ( adverse event , electrocardiogram ( ECGs ) , result safety laboratory determination ) , pharmacokinetic ( PK ) pharmacodynamic ( PD ) data collect . PK data collect minimum six ( 6 ) study subject cohort . PD data collect subject study cohort . Day 1 chemotherapy schedule discretion investigator provide subject complete minimum 1 day BIO 300 dosing . BIO 300 administer combination chemotherapy component protocol ( paclitaxel carboplatin ) . During second chemotherapy infusion , , additional safety , PK PD data collect . Day 1 radiation therapy ( RT ) may schedule discretion investigator provide subject complete minimum 2 day BIO 300 dosing . BIO 300 continue administer daily ; paclitaxel carboplatin administered weekly radiotherapy administer daily total dose 60 Gy administer . During period combine BIO 300 chemoradiotherapy ( 6 week ) , additional safety , PK PD data collect weekly . An interim data analysis complete high dose cohort conclude chemoradiation therapy , effort determine optimal biological dose . Following analysis , option enroll additional 12 subject optimal biological dose . At conclusion study , primary secondary outcome measure evaluate . Data analyze cohort determine oncologic response , safety BIO 300 , recommend BIO 300 dose .</detailed_description>
