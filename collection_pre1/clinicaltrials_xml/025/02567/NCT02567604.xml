The overall aim prepare COS age related-macular degeneration ( AMD ) RCTs . As first step develop COS AMD , investigator conduct systematic review confirm variability AMD trial ' outcome selection . The current step encompass involvement different stakeholder ' group focus group : patient caregiver ( current project ) family member friends help AMD patient everyday living . Knowledge caregiver ' perspective living , treatment outcome AMD key consideration building COS , may evaluate exist outcome , also experience may translate new outcome . In current focus group study , caregiver invite one hour discussion . The investigator plan arrange three focus group approximately 8 participant . Two researcher present help facilitate discussion . Participants ask experience relate help bring AMD patient , observation live treatment AMD well AMD study outcome importance .</detailed_description>
