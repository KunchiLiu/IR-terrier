Besides cardiopulmonary bypass ( CPB ) , congenital pathology coagulation test CPB , young age significant risk factor bleed transfusion requirement . In child volume pump prim much high compare patient 's circulate blood volume . For reason CPB tubing system prim packed red blood cell fresh frozen plasma ( FFP ) avoid excessive hemodilution induce coagulopathy . While routinely perform neonate small infant , routine priming CPB system FFP question several randomized prospective study older infant . However , result study conflict . Moreover , show methodological issue .</brief_summary>
