	<brief_summary>Clinical experience hyperthermia combine radiotherapy chemotherapy recurrent head neck cancer limit . The primary goal hyperthermia combine CCRT recurrent head neck cancer tumor response rate , secondary goal rate acute late adverse effect , local control rate , distant metastasis rate , progression-free rate overall survival rate .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Combination Hyperthermia Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy ( CCRT ) Recurrent Head Neck Cancer</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Patients treat radiotherapy 50Gy/22fx/6 week , plus hyperthermia 40 minute within 2hr irradiation , maximum temperature setted 42℃ ± 0.5℃ upper limit , week since 1st week radiation total 6 time . The regimen concurrent chemotherapy cisplatin 20mg/m2 taxotere 10-12mg/m2 per week 6 weekly cycle day radiotherapy hyperthermia treatment . The two chemotherapy agent give one day every week , accord weekly dose . According Gehan two-stage design , provide estimate tumor response rate use regimen 40 % objective tumor response observe ≥1 first 6 patient enrol , α &lt; 0.05 achieve indicate preliminary efficacy . Then Gehan second stage start . With set 5 % precision assumption 10 % dropout rate , 39 additional patient enrol Gehan second stage depend actual number tumor response Gehan first stage ( total 45 patient count first 6 Gehan first stage ) . The tumor response , adverse effect various survival curve analyze .</detailed_description>
