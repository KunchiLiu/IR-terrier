	<brief_summary>The drastic reduction nutritional intake anorexia nervosa ( AN ) alters many hormonal factor regulate activity bone cell . This alteration bone remodel characterize increase bone resorption decrease bone formation , lead mark reduction bone mineral density , osteoporosis increase risk fracture . To date , paucity study consensus management bone loss patient AN . The previous study perform small sample use short follow-up period . Denosumab fully human monoclonal antibody bind high specificity human RANKL ( 6 , 7 ) , thereby reduce number activity osteoclasts therefore decrease bone resorption find increase patient AN . Denosumab may transiently protect bone whilst psychonutritional management induce weight restoration</brief_summary>
