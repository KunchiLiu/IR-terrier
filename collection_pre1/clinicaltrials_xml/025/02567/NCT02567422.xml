	<brief_summary>This phase I trial study side effect best dose ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 ( VX-970 ) give together cisplatin radiation therapy treat patient human papillomavirus negative ( HPV ) ( - ) head neck squamous cell carcinoma spread start nearby tissue lymph node . ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 may stop growth tumor cell block enzymes need cell growth . Drugs use chemotherapy , cisplatin , work different way stop growth tumor cell , either kill cell , stop dividing , stop spread . Radiation therapy use high energy x-ray kill tumor cell shrink tumor . Giving ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 together cisplatin radiation therapy may work well treat patient locally advance HPV- negative head neck squamous cell carcinoma .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>PRIMARY OBJECTIVES : I. Assess safety tolerability VX-970 administer along weekly cisplatin radiation therapy ( XRT ) patient locoregionally advanced HPV ( - ) head neck squamous cell carcinoma ( HNSCC ) . II . Establish recommend phase 2 dose ( RP2D ) combination . SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : I . Characterize pharmacokinetic ( PK ) profile VX-970 . II . To observe record anti-tumor activity . III . To assess rate complete metabolic response 12 week post completion chemoradiation . IV . To conduct exploratory analysis association tissue-based biomarkers clinical outcome . OUTLINE : This dose-escalation study ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 . Patients receive ATR kinase inhibitor VX-970 intravenously ( IV ) 60 minute day -7 weekly day 2 cisplatin IV 30-60 minute weekly day 1 . Patients also undergo radiation therapy daily , 5 day week . Treatment continue 7 week absence disease progression unacceptable toxicity . After completion study treatment , patient follow 30 day .and every 3 month 2 year .</detailed_description>
