	<detailed_description>Periodontal disease group diseases affect 15 % population absence treatment cause tooth loss . Periodontal lesion characterize mainly strong inflammation hyper-vascularization . Search blood cell inflammatory marker attempt explain etiological-pathogenetic mechanism . Innate immunity assess qualitative quantitative analysis blood phagocyte , natural killer cell , complement , proteins inflammation cytokine . Current data literature subject give contradictory result comparison study difficult diversity population study , evaluate cell method use . The aim study evaluate innate immunity patient periodontal disease compare group patient without periodontal disease . The previous conclusion study focus difference general immunological parameter healthy patient patient suffer periodontal disease , current advance immunology help develop new marker functional status blood phagocytes anti-microbial action . The adhesion , migration , phagocytosis bactericidal capacity assess quantified use recognize test practice regularly analytical laboratory . The identification alter immunological parameter patient periodontal disease would better understand natural history disease may lead new diagnostic criterion , prognostic therapeutic . In practice , project bring together immunological skill ( functional analysis cell membrane marker ) dental ( patient selection diagnosis periodontal disease ) test applicable many patient likely develop periodontal disease .</detailed_description>
