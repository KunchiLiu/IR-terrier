	<detailed_description>Emotional disorder , encompass range anxiety depressive disorder , prevalent comorbid psychiatric disorder adolescence . They chronic , impair , costly , share overarch commonality . Unfortunately , evidence-based therapy ( EBTs ) exist single disorder domain ( e.g. , depression ) , rarely adopt community mental health center ( CMHC ) clinician , effect size modest ( 40-50 % youth treatment non-responders ) . Thus , method improve outcome youth , particularly CMHCs need . This study test effectiveness two novel intervention address need . The first intervention transdiagnostic treatment ( Unified Protocol Treatment Emotional Disorders Adolescents , UP-A ) , promise new approach use small number common strategy treat broad range emotional disorder . Transdiagnostic model align NIH 's initiative advance understanding treatment psychopathology use Research Domain Criteria ( RDoC ) . Importantly , treatment approach expect improve client outcome quicker uptake CMHC clinician : 1. comorbidity rule , rather exception make intervention relevant patient see CMHCs , 2. protocol cut across diagnostic boundary reduce train burden . The second intervention standardize monitor feedback system ( MFS ; Youth Outcomes Questionnaires , YOQ ) . This intervention build exist electronic medical record infrastructure CMHCs thus appeal acceptability , ease transport clinical practice , sustainability . Emerging data suggest MFS alone improve outcome relative TAU adequately test youth . As added value , study also address common threat internal validity previous RCTs evaluate EBT isolate confound effect increase measurement feedback clinician . Finally , address central aim RFA make unique critical contribution treatment literature , study examine theoretically-linked mechanism ( patient provider level ) treatment outcomes UP-A YOQ . This collaborative R01 proposal ( response RFA-MH-15-325 ) prepare Drs . Ehrenreich-May Jensen-Doss University Miami ( Miami ) Dr. Ginsburg The University Connecticut School Medicine ( UConn ; application identical ) . To test study aim , 222 adolescent ( age 12-17 ) anxiety and/or depressive disorder recruit CMHCs Miami Hartford ( 111 adolescent 9 clinician site ) . Both adolescent clinician randomize one three condition : 1 . TAU alone ; 2 . TAU plus YOQ , 3 . UP-A plus YOQ . Research assessments occur baseline , 8 week 16 week treatment initiation 3-month follow-up . If effective , intervention potential change clinical practice CMHCs equip clinician effective intervention apply broad range patient .</detailed_description>
	<criteria>1 . Male female adolescent age 1218 year time enrollment clinically significant symptom anxiety depression baseline . Evidence clinically significant symptom define Clinical Severity Rating ( CSR ) great equal 4 DSM5 define anxiety disorder ( e.g. , generalized anxiety disorder , social phobia , selective mutism , separation anxiety disorder ) depressive disorder ( e.g. , major depressive disorder , persistent depressive disorder ) , adjustment disorder depress mood , anxiety , mixed anxiety depress mood . 2 .

Adolescent parent/guardian able complete study procedure English Spanish . 1 . Adolescents exclude receive concurrent psychotherapy , family therapy similar psychosocial intervention . 2 . Consistent prior RCT UPA , use psychopharmacologic treatment anxiety depression allowable ; adolescent must stable dosage 2 month SSRI 1 month benzodiazepine prior consent study . The type , dosage frequency medication monitor major study assessment point , subsequent change incur exclusion investigation . Adolescents stable dos stimulant ADHD least one month SNRI ( e.g. , Strattera ) ADHD least two month also include . 3 . Adolescents currently suicidal engage suicidal behavior within past 6 month exclude referred appropriate clinical intervention . 4 . Adolescents current substance abuse disorder determine use ADIS5C/P , exclude . 5 . Consistent prior trial UPA , youth primary condition specify exclusion ( e.g. , eat disorder , schizophrenia ) screen . As long study staff concur emotional disorder treatment focus appropriate , youth include . 6 . Adolescents report history intellectual disability substantial evidence ( e.g. , multiple learning disorder , extensive schoolbased accommodation learn ) cognitive level UPA would make inappropriate individual therapy modality , determine via Family Background Questionnaire and/or base PI judgement , exclude . 7 . Given additional complexity obtain informed consent , adolescent currently place foster care system exclude .</criteria>
