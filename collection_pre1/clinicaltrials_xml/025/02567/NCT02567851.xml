	<brief_summary>An early phase II , single arm , two stage study , investigate level activity , duration response tolerability brentuximab vedotin ( SGN-35 ) , single agent , utilise response adapt approach , old , frail co-morbid patient previously untreated Hodgkin lymphoma . Opened Feb 2014 recruit 18 month . Duration treatment dependent patient ' response ( see schema ) maximum 16 cycle 48 week . At end treatment patient assess clinically 3 month interval CT scan 15 , 18 , 24 36 month . For still alive disease free 2 year , follow-up accord local practice .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Brentuximab Vedotin Patients With Hodgkin Lymphoma Unsuitable Chemotherapy Due Age , Frailty Co-morbidity</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stage 1 recruit 20 patient . If least patient 8 respond initial 4 cycle SGN-35 10 patient recruit stage 2 . In case brentuximab vedotin administer initial dose 1.8 mg/kg every 3 week 30-minute outpatient i.v . infusion . After baseline staging ( include PET CT scan ( PET0 + CT0 ) , perform PET scanner approve purpose The PET Imaging Centre St Thomas'/Guy 's ) , eligible consent patient receive initial 4 cycle brentuximab vedotin follow response continuation brentuximab vedotin assess PET ( PET4 ) first instance . Patients achieve CMR ( Deauville score 1-3 ) continue treatment . Patients achieve PMR ( Deauville score 4,5 uptake less baseline ) also continue treatment . Patients achieve NMR ( Deauville score 4,5 change uptake baseline ) PMD ( Deauville score 4,5 increase intensity uptake compare baseline and/or new lesion consistent lymphoma ) stop brentuximab vedotin consider alternative therapy . CT4 perform future comparison CT8 , CT12 CT 16 ( exclude Progressive Disease ( PD ) correlate metabolic radiological response ) inform continue treatment . Patients achieve Deauville score 1-3 PET 4 also PET scan completion treatment ( 16 cycle earlier brentuximab vedotin discontinue reason PD ) In addition exploratory PET scan perform 2 cycle brentuximab vedotin ( PET2 ) ; investigator blind result PET2 influence patient management way . All PET scan centrally review QA purpose The PET Imaging Centre St Thomas'/Guy 's , supervision Sally Barrington Mike O'Doherty , use framework develop recently complete RAPID RATHL trial . CT scan 4 cycle end treatment may also review . After initial 4 cycle brentuximab vedotin , subsequent treatment response adapt accord PET scan result follow schedule : - Those Complete Metabolic Response ( CMR , Deauville Score 1 , 2 3 ) PET 4 receive 12 additional cycle brentuximab vedotin ( maximum 16 cycle ) depend evidence PD CT scan perform group 4 cycle brentuximab vedotin . - Patients Partial Metabolic Response ( PMR ) PET4 receive 12 additional cycle brentuximab vedotin ( maximum 16 cycle ) depend evidence PD CT scan perform group 4 cycle brentuximab vedotin . - Patients No Metabolic Response ( NMR ) stop brentuximab vedotin consider alternative therapy . - Patients progressive disease time determine either CT PET scan perform group 4 cycle brentuximab vedotin response clinical concern stop study treatment receive subsequent therapy investigator discretion . Clinical concern PD confirm either CT PET scan . - Patients come treatment brentuximab vedotin reason ( toxicity , patient decision , investigator advice ) CT scan perform response assessment . In addition patient Partial Metabolic Response PET 4 also PET scan perform . All patient progress irrespective many cycle brentuximab vedotin receive clinically assess every 3 month CT scan month 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 . These scan may take place therapy . During follow-up CT scan perform 15 , 18 , 24 36 month start treatment . For still alive disease-free 3 year follow start treatment , follow-up accord local practice data record must include date progressive disease , type subsequent therapy , date cause death . For patient progress time , follow-up accord local practice data must record 5 year form start treatment must include date progressive disease , type subsequent therapy , date cause death .</detailed_description>
