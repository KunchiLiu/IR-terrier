	<brief_title>Cognitive Remediation Improve Mobility Sedentary Seniors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Emerging evidence indicate Executive Functions play important role maintain locomotion age prevent mobility disability . However , use cognitive training program improve executive function strategy increase mobility explore . Exciting result preliminary study support efficacy feasibility cognitive remediation approach improve locomotion old adult . The premise clinical trial disability among senior potentially preventable chronic condition rather irreversible consequence age disease . The investigator propose novel approach locomotion potential shift treatment paradigms field disability introduce cognitive approach mobility apply prevention rehabilitation diverse setting . Through 'proof concept ' secondary prevention trial investigator fill important gap knowledge practice evidence-based medicine develop effective intervention major health outcome affect substantial proportion U.S. age population .</detailed_description>

Subjects classify 'nonambulatory ' unable leave confines home attend clinic visit . 5 . Gait velocity ≤1 m/s . 6 . Short Physical Performance Battery score ≤9 . 1 . Presence dementia identify one following : Telephone base Memory Impairment Screen score ( TMIS ) &lt; 5 , Alzheimer 's Disease 8 ( AD8 ) ≥ 2 . Or dementia diagnose baseline cognitive assessment . 2 . Serious chronic acute illness cancer ( late stage , metastatic , active treatment ) , chronic pulmonary disease ventilator continuous oxygen therapy active liver disease . 3 . Mobility limitation solely due musculoskeletal limitation pain ( e.g. , severe osteoarthritis ) prevent subject complete mobility test . Presence arthritis use exclude subject complete mobility task . 4 .
