	<brief_title>Ultibro® Versus Spiriva® Alone Reduce Exertional Dyspnea Patients With Moderate Severe COPD</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The foundation COPD therapy combine inhale therapy optimize benefit do several year ago associate short-acting β2-agonists muscarinic antagonist . The recent availability once-daily LABA/LAMA fix combination product make therapeutic strategy even appeal appear promise treatment option COPD . One relevant question regard new LABA/LAMA combination whether provide superior benefit compare single agent . Once-daily LABA/LAMA fix combination consistently improve lung function compare monotherapy . The key question whether provide superior efficacy monotherapy patient 's oriented clinical outcome , beyond lung function improvement . In regard , once-daily LABA/LAMA fix combination reduce exacerbation rate perception dyspnea , obtain monocomponents . Once-daily LABA/LAMA fix combination also improve exercise tolerance compare placebo whether provide additional benefit monotherapy uncertain . Dyspnea troublesome symptom COPD felt main mechanism bronchodilator improve exercise tolerance reduce dyspnea . As , dyspnea measurement appear valid surrogate exercise tolerance . One advantage dyspnea measurement measurement exercise endurance require maximal effort . In regard , may less noisy outcome exercise duration . Dyspnea quantify 6-min walking test pre post-intervention comparison make difficult since walk speed thus exercise stimulus control test . Another strategy evaluate effect intervention exertional dyspnea compare dyspnea isotime control walk cycle speed endurance shuttle walk test constant rate cycling test . One limitation approach pre post intervention dyspnea measurement always obtain time point since duration test variable . To overcome problem , linear interpolation use estimate dyspnea . However , approach robust `` real '' dyspnea score directly obtain patient . To circumvent difficulty , investigator recently develop strong simple exercise methodology whose primary objective ass exertional dyspnea patient COPD : 3-min constant rate shuttle walk test . During test , modification endurance shuttle walk test , patient ask walk around two cone set-up flat corridor separate 10m . An audio signal use impose walk speed test end fix duration 3 minute symptoms become intolerable . At pre-specified time point test , end test ( 3 min ) , patient ask score perception dyspnea Borg scale . The feasibility reproducibility test provide standardized physical stimulus measurable level dyspnea patient moderate severe COPD report . In one study , investigator also confirm responsiveness test bronchodilation , report statistically clinically significant reduction Borg dyspnea score ipratropium bromide compare placebo . Methodology : The study require 7 visit ; run-in familiarization phase ( visits # 1-3 ) , treatment A phase ( visits # 4-5 ) , treatment B phase ( visits # 6-7 ) . The first visit use review inclusion criterion obtain consent . A spirometry obtain . Patient tiotropium glycopyrronium switch open label ipratropium ( see allow medication ) . Visit # 2 include pulmonary function test include spirometry , lung volume diffusion capacity measurement . A maximal incremental shuttle walk test , COPD assessment test ( CAT ) MRC scale also complete . Patients familiarize 3-min constant rate shuttle walk test . During Visit # 3 , patient perform two 3-min constant rate shuttle walk test serve determine dyspnea baseline . The investigator aim dyspnea Borg Score &gt; 3 , rationale important obtain significant dyspnea signal consider objective study evaluate efficacy bronchodilation improve dyspnea . Patients possible achieve level dyspnea end 3- min constant rate shuttle walk test exclude study participation . Patients enter cross-over study design receive one two study treatment : indacaterol 110 µg/Glycopyrronium 50 µg ( Ultibro® ) day Tiotropium 18 µg ( Spiriva® ) day . The treatment period three week . There 2-week washout period two treatment phase . Total study duration thus 11 week . Visit # 4 visit # 6 baseline visit treatment period ( except dyspnea 3-min constant rate shuttle walk test determine Visit # 3 ) . Participants perform spirometry , lung volume measurement 1h 20 min receive study medication . Two 3-min constant rate shuttle walk test perform 2h 25 min dosing , start one perform complete high speed V3 . This time schedule chosen base previous study field . Dyspnea assess baseline dyspnea index ( BDI ) health status evaluate COPD Assessment Test ( CAT ) . The procedure repeat end 3-week study treatment ( Visits # 5 # 7 ) difference chronic dyspnea assess transitional dyspnea index ( TDI ) . Allowed medication There 3-week run-in period patient receive open label ipratropium ( Atrovent® MDI 20µg/ puff , 4 puff QID ) prn salbutamol ( Ventolin® MDI 100µg/puff , 2 puff every 3-4 hour PRN ) . Ipratropium allow run-in washout period . Ipratropium stop twelve hour study visit ( Visit # 3 , 4 , 6 ) . Salbutamol prn basis allow throughout study except stop 6 hour prior Visit # 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 7 . Long-acting 2-agonist prohibit Visit # 1 throughout study duration . Inhaled corticosteroid allow dosage study . PDE4 inhibitor leukotriene antagonist also allow . Blinding Patient study staff blind treatment administration 2 study period . Treatments consist , one treatment period active Ultibro® day placebo Spiriva® handihaler , period placebo Ultibro® day active Spiriva® handihaler . Active medication placebo identical appearance order study medication randomize . Pre-package envelope contain equal quantity inhaler combination number kept secure place ( pharmacy hospital research site ) . At end study data collection blind code open complete primary data analysis . Randomization stratify site occur Visit # 4 centralize use computerized system pre-packaged study medication . Evaluation criterion : Primary endpoint difference Borg dyspnea score 3-min constant rate shuttle walk test 3 week treatment indacaterol 110µg/Glycopyrronium 50µg ( Ultibro® ) versus Tiotropium 18µg ( Spiriva® ) alone . Secondary endpoint difference Borg dyspnea score 3-min constant rate shuttle walk test 3 week treatment indacaterol 110µg/Glycopyrronium 50µg ( Ultibro® ) versus baseline value ( Visit # 3 ) Tiotropium 18µg ( Spiriva® ) alone versus baseline value ( Visit # 3 ) . The dyspnea response first dose therapy also assess . The between-treatment difference improvement pulmonary function ( FEV1 inspiratory capacity ) , TDI CAT score baseline ( V4 ) end treatment period ( V5 V7 ) also evaluate . Assessment procedure Pulmonary function test . Spirometry , lung volume diffusion capacity measure accord routine technique . Maximal incremental shuttle walk . As originally describe Singh colleague , incremental shuttle walk perform enclosed corridor flat 10-m-long course . The course identify two cone , position 0.5 either end allow patient walk circle thereby avoid need abrupt change direction . Patients walk predetermine rhythm , dictate audio signal play CD . Walking speed initially set 0.50 m/sec increase 0.17 m/sec every minute patient reach maximal capacity . Since effect encouragement walk performance demonstrate , encouragement give patient throughout test . The final measure distance walk , express meter . 3-min constant rate shuttle walk test . This test consist one bout three minute walk initial walk speed 4.0 km/h . Thirty minute first bout walking , second test perform walk speed either 6.0 2.5 km/h . The second walking speed determine ability carry test 4.0 km/h . If patient complete first test , second speed step 2.5 km/h . If patient able carry though first test , second walk speed raise 6.0 km/h . Patients ask perform two test two different speed order determine , amongst 3 different walk speed , high speed sustain entire 3 minute . In , objective induce level dyspnea sufficiently high amenable therapy . These walk speed select base previous work19 show sufficiently demand induce measurable level dyspnea moderate severe patient COPD able complete test desire duration . Patients direct follow audio signal entire 3 minute test become symptom limit . They instruct walk around two cone set-up hospital hallway pace walk way wait cone follow audio signal . Cardiac ventilatory measure . During exercise test , cardiac ventilatory parameter measure use commercially available exercise circuit . Dyspnea assess use 10-point modify Borg scale position one extremity course .</detailed_description>
