	<brief_summary>Since 2000 , annual number malaria case South Africa sharply decline 5,000 , case number fairly stable since 2007 . The principal malaria prevention strategy consist generalised Indoor Residual Spraying ( IRS ) house malaria endemic district . As recent case data indicate level transmission many district reduce low level , continuation untargeted IRS area little evidence recent transmission may unwarranted . Efforts eliminate malaria sustainable mass prevention effort scale evidence-based manner , whilst maintain enhance high sensitivity surveillance system disease . This trial provide scientific evidence target malaria prevention respond localised transmission pre-elimination setting , compare continuation generalise IRS house . Two method IRS delivery community malaria prevention compare open-label cluster-randomised trial consist two study arm 30 cluster per arm approximately 8,000 inhabitant per cluster . Comparison basis non-inferiority show malaria incidence target IRS arm high malaria incidence generalise IRS arm within specified margin difference , basis superiority show proportion house target spray high intervention reference arm . Neighbourhood investigation response two case intervention arm , comparison neighbourhood reference arm , include test antibody sero-conversion malarial antigen ass whether case arise community long term exposure malaria parasite . The trial carry South African province Limpopo Mpumalanga , localities average report incidence malaria &lt; 5 case per 1000 per annum past five year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Two method IRS delivery malaria prevention , target spray versus annual generalise spraying , compare open-label cluster randomise trial consist two trial arm 30 cluster per arm . Clusters artificial construct make group spray locality complete ward comprise population 5,000 10,000 person . The unit randomisation cluster . The intervention arm trial receive IRS delivery target reactive spraying neighbourhood recent local case ; reference ( control ) arm trial receive IRS generalise annual spraying structure per standard current practice . Comparison basis non-inferiority show malaria incidence target IRS arm high malaria incidence generalise IRS arm within specified margin difference , basis superiority show proportion house spray , target spraying , high intervention reference arm . Neighbourhood investigation response two case intervention arm , comparison neighbourhood reference arm include test antibody sero-conversion malarial antigen ass whether case arise community long term exposure malarial parasite .</detailed_description>
