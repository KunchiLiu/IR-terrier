	<detailed_description>This study intend provide investigator sponsor follow information regard investigational new drug MT-3724 patient relapsed/refractory Chronic B-cell Lymphocytic Leukemia Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma : The maximum dose single course MT-3724 give intravenous ( IV ) infusion Days 1 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 10 12 negligible side effect and/or maximum serum level and/or maximum effect blood lymphocytes observe . Four dose level investigate . The change MT-3724 serum level blood lymphocyte time follow IV dos different point study . The change kinds clinical laboratory effect side effect may occur repeated course MT-3724 The change subject 's immune status CLL SLL follow one cycle 6 infusion .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>Men woman , age 18 year old Life expectancy &gt; 3 month Flow cytometric confirmation CLL require screening . Previous confirmation CLL/SLL include confirm immunohistological diagnosis characteristic CD5+/CD20+ Bcell immunophenotype accord WHO criteria For CLL : . An absolute peripheral blood monoclonal CD20+/CD5+ Blymphocyte count &gt; 5000/μL duration least 3 month For SLL : An absolute peripheral blood monoclonal CD20+/CD5+ Blymphocyte count &lt; 5000/μL AND Presence lymphadenopathy and/or splenomegaly , histopathological evaluation lymph node biopsy consistent CLL/SLL . Staging CLL : Rai Stage III IV disease , stage 0II disease meet NCIWG criterion active disease require therapy ; SLL : Intermediate high risk Ann Arbor Staging Cotswald Modifications meet criterion active disease require therapy . Relapsed/ Refractory CLL/SLL progress despite treatment approved therapy know provide clinical benefit disease potential subject eligible potential subject must refuse available approved treatment option prior consideration enrollment . Potential subject must receive least one antiCD20 antibody contain regimen past resulted initial measurable response ( partial complete remission ) , follow relapse/recurrence . Potential subject highdose chemotherapy autologous stem cell transplantation ( HDASCT ) consider standard curative therapy eligible study potential subject 's disease relapse HDASCT , potential subject eligible HDASCT potential subject refuse HDASCT . Potential subject HDASCT must least 26 week beyond transplant . All potential subject require measurable disease follow previous therapy CLL/SLL . Measurable disease , determine NCIWG criterion , follow standard firstline salvage therapy ; include potential subject progressive disease ( PDs ) , stable disease ( SDs ) , partial remission ( PR ) and/or Residual disease determine measurable disease ( i.e. , PDs , SDs , PR ) MRD positivity , determine flow cytometry bone marrow and/or peripheral blood ( see Laboratory Manual ) potential subject Complete Response ( CR ) CR incomplete bone marrow recovery ( CRi ) ( previously term `` nodular partial remission '' [ ( nPR ] ) Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ( ECOG ) performance status &lt; 2 . Patients must least 28 day past last course leukemia lymphoma treatment recover side effect therapy completely minor residual symptom include significant laboratory . Patients preexist severe life threaten side effects/conditions prior therapy due disease may enrol Female patient childbearing potential must negative serum urine pregnancy test within 3 day prior initiate dose . Male female subject reproductive potential must agree use acceptable contraceptive method study therapy 12 week follow last dose study medication . Ongoing use approve investigational antineoplastic therapy exception ongoing hormonal therapy breast cancer ( without evidence active disease ) prostate cancer ( stable hormonal therapy ) . History absolute antiCD20 monoclonal antibody ( MAb ) refractory CLL/SLL , define failure ever achieve PR , CR persistent lymphocytic nodule marrow ( `` nPR '' ) , CR least 6 month response least one antiCD20 MAbcontaining regimen amongst past CLL/SLL treatment . Potential subject experience significant ( CTCAE Grade 3 4 without neutropenia ) infection within 2 week first dose MT3724 . Patients comply protocol requirement include clinic visit intravenous infusion birth control measure may enrol . Female patient pregnant breast feed . Patients eligible use approved investigational antineoplastic therapy investigational therapy reason . Patients may receive systemic corticosteroid therapy prednisone dose &gt; 20 mg/day ( steroid equivalent ) within 2 week start study . Patients uncontrolled severe cardiovascular disease , include myocardial infarct unstable angina within 6 month prior start study treatment , New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class II great congestive heart failure , serious arrhythmia require medication treatment , clinically significant pericardial disease , cardiac amyloidosis may enrol . Patients known history drug abuse chronic neurologic , psychiatric , endocrine , metabolic , immunologic , hepatic renal disease ( include history hemolytic uremic syndrome ) opinion Investigator would adversely affect study participation . Patients know active Hepatitis C , HIV present history Hepatitis B Patients must receive vaccine 28 day prior administration first dose MT3724 receive vaccine study within 28 day last dose MT3724 . Patients suspect allergy sensitivity component MT3724 drug preparation base upon know allergy compound similar class anaphylactic severe infusion reaction human immunoglobulin monoclonal antibody administration eligible . Potential subject undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant solid organ transplant . Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant within 26 week prior study entry ; history allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant .</criteria>
