	<brief_summary>Kasensero , fish community Lake Victoria Uganda , representative HIV `` hotspot '' extremely high HIV prevalence ( 44.3 % ) incidence ( ~3.9/100py ) , yet low HIV service utilization . Hotspots Kasensero may seed sustain HIV general population , compromise national regional HIV control effort . PEPFAR , UNAIDS , WHO recognize urgent need target hotspot enhance HIV treatment prevention effort . However , evidence low-cost , comprehensive , effective HIV control strategies hotspot limited thus priority need field . The investigator propose implementation science , cluster-randomized , controlled trial Kasensero evaluate impact HIV service uptake HIV incidence CHWs promote combination HIV prevention ( CHP ) service support mobile health technology ( mHealth ) . CHP implementation multiple , evidence-based HIV prevention service ( HIV test counseling , antiretroviral therapy , medical male circumcision , behavior change ) maximize population-level impact HIV incidence . For CHP substantively decrease HIV incidence , community member must assess risk factor current CHP utilization , triaged , motivate , link , , HIV-infected , retain care . The propose intervention use low-cost CHWs leverage mHealth decision support counseling tool promote CHP along entire continuum HIV service utilization . The hypothesis implementation science research resident cluster receive implementation intervention improve CHP service uptake decrease Population Prevalence Viremia ( PPDV ) compare control receive standard care . The intervention evaluate pragmatic , cluster-randomized trial nest within large , ongoing population-based cohort study HIV , Rakai Community Cohort Study ( RCCS ) . Intervention arm participant visit place residence CHWs train evaluate triage participant risk category , provide tailor CHP health counseling , linkage , adherence support , support mHealth decision support tool . The primary outcome CHP service coverage PPDV . Other outcome HIV incidence , population viral load , implementation measure , retention , virologic suppression , sexual behavior . Complimentary mixed method ( quantitative , qualitative , cost ) evaluations trial conducted evaluate implementation process , facilitator , barrier inform study result future program uptake . Focus group in-depth interview conduct follow-up period synthesize quantitative data . Intervention cost prospectively measure provide information program affordability . Through study , novel , low-cost , scalable implementation intervention improve CHP uptake evaluate HIV `` hotspot '' critical control HIV epidemic . The study design ensure rigorous evidence immediate relevance many stakeholder .</brief_summary>
