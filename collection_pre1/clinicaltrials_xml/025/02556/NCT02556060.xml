	<brief_title>Lamotrigine Ketamine Dependence Trial</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Introduction Ketamine anesthetic derivative phencyclidine ( PCP ; 'Angel dust ' ) dissociative , analgesic psychedelic property . Recreational use ketamine first document west coast United States early 1970s . Ketamine frequently describe `` unique drug '' show hypnotic ( sleep produce ) , analgesic ( pain relieve ) amnesic ( short-term memory loss ) effect ; drug use clinical practice combine three important feature time . Ketamine produce anaesthetic state , term `` dissociative anaesthesia '' , characterize analgesia change vigilance perception , sedative hypnotic . It appear ketamine selectively interrupts thalamocortical system . Ketamine anxiolytic- antidepressant-like property sub-anesthetic dos . Mechanism ketamine addiction The existence binding site PCP ketamine first identified 1979 . Earlier report indicate ketamine essentially block N-methyl-D-aspartate ( NMDA ) subtype glutamate receptor . The antagonism NMDA receptor responsible specific property include psychedelic , anesthetic , analgesic , anxiolytic , antidepressant , hypnotic effect cognitive impairment . In fact , ketamine also bind non-NMDA glutamate receptor involve glutamate-independent mechanism associate nicotinic muscarinic cholinergic , monoaminergic opioid receptor . Currently specific pharmacological treatment model ketamine dependence . Continuous urine screen plus medication psychiatric symptom treatment reveal fair result . Study drug : Lamotrigine Lamotrigine anticonvulsant drug use treatment epilepsy bipolar disorder . Besides 's sodium channel block effect antiepileptic drug , lamotrigine also inhibit release glutamate modulation high voltage-activated calcium current sodium channel . Method Patient Patients ketamine use disorder seek treatment Taipei City Hospital Psychiatric Center invite participate clinical trial . Treatment assessment Schedule After informed consent signature explanation procedure study , initiation include collect drug use history medical history , conduct physical examination , perform clinical laboratory test . The study duration last 12 week patient monitor week 0 , week 1 , week 2 , week 4 , week 8 , week 12 6 time . Urinary toxicology visual analogue scale check visit laboratory chemistry visit . Randomization The study subject randomly assign computer-generated number either lamotrigine placebo group 1:1 ratio . Dosage trial medication Trial medication placebo sponsor Lotus pharmaceutical , Taiwan . It extend release tablet form lamotrigine identical placebo . The preparation double procedure handle Department Pharmacy Taipei City Hospital . Once subject enters treatment phase ( randomization ) dosage study medication 25 mg/before bed ( one half placebo tablet night ) 7 day . On day 8 ( visit 2 begin week 2 ) , dosage increase , tolerate , 50 mg/day another week . After , dosage increase 100 mg/day ( QD HS ) 2 week . After 4 week , dosage may keep increase , judge investigator , range 100mg 200mg /day end 12 week . The dosage may decrease time side effect , less 100 mg . If patient prefers , may take daily dose medication morning evening . The enroll period 2 year total study duration 3 year . Concomitant prohibit medication During study period , patient take original medication systemic disorder . Due patient drug abuse usually depress mood , emotional disturbance sleep problem withdrawal period , benzodiazepine , short act novel hypnotic zolpidem zaleplon use ethical consideration . For patient treat antipsychotic due drug-induced psychosis , patient enrol psychotic symptom remit low dose antipsychotic use trial period . The prohibited medication include medication drug-drug interaction carbamazepine , phenytoin barbiturate , rifampicin , chlordiazepoxide oral hypoglycaemics . Primary endpoint The primary endpoint result urinary drug screen ketamine , substance include amphetamine , methylenedioxymethamphetamine , morphine cannabis , carry baseline visit study period . Secondary endpoint Subjective visual analogue scale crave patient subjective clinical global impression severity second endpoint . The Brief Addiction Severity Index ketamine use also analyze .</detailed_description>
