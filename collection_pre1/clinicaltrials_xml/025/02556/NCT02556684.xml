	<brief_title>Breast-Specific Gamma Imaging Locally Advanced Breast Cancer Undergoing Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Locally advanced breast cancer ( LABC ) usually treat neoadjuvant chemotherapy follow surgery . At present , monitor tumor response chemotherapy primarily carry use physical examination begin chemotherapy cycle . Differentiating viable tumor tissue inflammation fibrotic scar tissue difficult . There grow body evidence newer image technique positron emission tomography ( PET ) magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) may better determine whether tumor actually shrink , sensitivity specificity ideal . Breast-specific gamma imaging ( BSGI ) use 99mTcsestamibi relatively new nuclear medicine imaging technique breast tumor detection . BSGI show high sensitivity conventional scintimammography detection small breast cancer lesion owe high resolution . BSGI useful complementary tool ultrasound , mammography MRI breast cancer diagnosis , especially dense breast multifocal multicentric disease ; however , little known ability BSGI predict clinical pathological response neo-adjuvant chemotherapy patient locally advance breast cancer . The purpose study determine sensitivity specificity BSGI evaluate tumor response chemotherapy patient LABC compare physical examination , ultrasound , mammography MRI , current conventional standard care . A prospective cohort study design conduct . Patients LABC receive chemotherapy undergo physical examination , ultrasound , MRI , BSGI baseline , midway , completion chemotherapy . Approximately 100 patient recruited 2-year period . This study give clinician insight usefulness ultrasound , MRI , BSGI monitoring treatment responses patient LABC . This could potentially lead change clinical management patient .</detailed_description>
