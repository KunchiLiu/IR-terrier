	<brief_title>Effects rTMS Based Brain Activation During Language Performance Stroke Patients With Non-fluent Aphasia</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>In poststsroke aphasia rehabilitation , repetitive transcranial stimulation ( rTMS ) study aim reinforce activity brain region leave hemisphere . This goal achieve use excitatory protocol reactivate perilesional area inhibitory protocol reduce activity contralesional area . However , conventional rTMS study employ inhibitory low frequency protocol contralesional homologs Broca 's area . In present pilot study , investigator perform functional near-infrared spectroscopy ( fNIRS ) prior rTMS treatment selection appropriate application stimulation . Stimulation site protocol ( high frequency low frequency rTMS ) determine activation pattern fNIRS finding language task individual patient .</detailed_description>
