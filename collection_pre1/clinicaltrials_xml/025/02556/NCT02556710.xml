As result medical review screen investigation , Principal Investigator consider patient unfit study A history allergic reaction human albumin ( reaction nonhuman albumin egg albumin exclusion criterion ) A history allergic reaction excipients 5 % human albumin ( Nacetyltryptophan , sodium caprylate ) Presence tense effusion Inflammatory crystal arthropathy , acute fracture , history aseptic necrosis joint replacement affect knee , assess locally Principal Investigator Isolated patella femoral syndrome , also know chondromalacia Any disease condition interfere free use evaluation index knee duration trial ( e.g . cancer , congenital defect , spine osteoarthritis ) Major injury index knee within 12 month prior screen Severe hip osteoarthritis ipsilateral index knee Any pain could interfere assessment index knee pain ( e.g . pain part low extremity , pain radiate knee ) Any pharmacological nonpharmacological treatment target OA start change 4 week prior randomization likely change duration study Pregnancy plan become pregnant study . Use follow medication : No IA inject pain medication study knee study No analgesic contain opioids . NSAIDs permit study ; acetaminophen available rescue medication study provide supply . No topical treatment osteoarthritis index knee study No significant anticoagulant therapy ( e.g . Heparin Lovenox ) study ( treatment low dose Aspirin Plavix allow ) No systemic treatment may interfere safety efficacy assessment study No immunosuppressant No use corticosteroids No human albumin treatment 3 month randomization throughout duration study</criteria>
