	<detailed_description>This Phase 2 , pilot study JKB-122 give daily 24 week subject AIH liver enzymes 1.25 10 time upper limit normal ( ULN ) fail response , incomplete response , intolerant , ineligible unwilling take current immunosuppressant therapy . Current immunosuppressant therapy define prednisone steroid without azathioprine . Failed response define non-responsive worsening symptom ( elevated Alanine Aminotransferase ( ALT ) /aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) and/or total bilirubin ) despite compliance standard care ( SOC ) 6 month period . Incomplete response define lack sustained normalization elevate ALT/AST current standard care ( SOC ) least 6 month . `` Refractory '' current therapy include patient fail response , incomplete response current therapy . Subjects least 18 year age , either male female therapy AIH normalization ALT current therapy .</detailed_description>
