	<brief_summary>This open-label observational study pure CBD treatment 25 child intractable epilepsy . As pure CBD FDA approve , investigator conduct study via FDA expand access mechanism compassionate use basis . The target patient population child severe refractory epilepsy exhaust reasonable avenue treatment . These patient risk relatively untested product outweigh potential benefit . Using seizure-diaries maintain routine clinical basis , seizure frequency assess four week prior initiation CBD , one month CBD initiation , least every 3 month thereafter . CBD administer adjunct current anti-epileptic therapy .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Study Overview : The investigator hope gain understanding utility pure CBD use treatment drug resistant epilepsy open-label dose-finding observational study . A baseline seizure frequency record subject diary four week prior investigational drug initiation parents/caregivers document seizure daily basis throughout study period . Investigational drug ( CBD ) administer adjunct current anti-epileptic drug . Once maintenance daily dose evaluate one month achieve final steady state dose every three month thereafter . Visits consist neurological exam seizure diary review . Baseline visit take 1 hour visit thereafter take approximately 30 minute . Safety Tolerability Measurements : Data safety tolerability pure CBD limit . According GW Pharma CBD Investigator 's Brochure ( Appendix G ) , side effect report great placebo highly purify CBD one clinical trial conjunctival hemorrhage , change vision , diarrhea , flatulence , gastric reflux , joint pain , muscle pain , difficulty concentrating , abnormal mood trouble sleep . The patient closely monitored side effect titration treatment period dose and/or frequency may adjust appropriate . CBD inhibitor CYP 2C19 , CYP 2C9 , cytochrome P450s belong 2C 3A subfamily . The effect CBD administer concomitantly anti-epileptic drug metabolize enzyme system unknown . Anti-epileptic drug dos adjust need base sign symptom toxicity / change drug level . Measurement change seizure frequency : All seizure type classify study entry . Seizure type frequency monitor baseline treatment record patient diary . For assess efficacy CBD , investigator count change frequency seizure ( ie , tonic seizure , clonic seizure , tonic-clonic seizure last 3 second , atonic seizure , myoclonic seizure include myoclonic absence ) . In addition , parents/caregivers report : - Change average seizure severity seizure type , define increase decrease seizure duration intensity - Change number episode status epilepticus , define convulsive seizure last long 10 minute - Change number use rescue medication - Change number ER visits/ hospitalization Data Safety Monitoring : The Principal Investigator review data relate safety tolerability throughout study , every third patient treat , monitor study conduct ass patient safety . Benefits : Subject may reduction seizure . This study help researcher learn effectiveness safety CBD treatment drug-resistant epilepsy . Hopefully information help treatment future patient condition .</detailed_description>
