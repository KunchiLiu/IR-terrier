	<brief_summary>Systemic sclerosis ( SSc ) generalize disorder connective tissue , arterioles microvessels , characterize occurrence fibrosis vascular obliteration phenomenon . The alteration lung microvessels find pulmonary involvement scleroderma , serious complication disease . In pulmonary emphysema , also change pulmonary microvasculature , involve onset development disease . The confocal endomicroscopy endoscopic technique perform bronchoscopy . This technique make possible observe real time distal pulmonary element microscopic scale . After injection fluorescein , technique observe pulmonary microvasculature , vivo situ . The characterization microvascular lesion two pathology could improve understand mechanism ultimately improve early management patient .</brief_summary>
