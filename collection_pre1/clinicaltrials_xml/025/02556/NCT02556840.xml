	<brief_summary>Maturity-onset diabetes youth ( MODY ) frequent monogenic diabetes autosomic dominant inheritance ( 2 % diabetes ) . The MODY2 diabetes related defect glucokinase ( GCK ) enzyme , first limit step insulin secretion . An abnormal GCK lead delay insulin secretion . Patients GCK mutation mild raise fasting plasma glucose . Treatment usually unnecessary since hyperglycemia stable MODY2 patient microvascular complication diabetes . In contrast , pregnancy MODY2 woman challenge situation . A non-mutated fetus produce excess insulin response raise maternal blood glucose lead accelerated growth high risk macrosomia . The mother non-mutated fetus therefore treat normalize blood glucose level . On contrary , mutate fetus produce delay insulin secretion ( MODY2 mother ) response maternal hyperglycemia . Consequently insulin therapy pregnancy would reduce fetal insulin secretion result low birth weight . Moreover , insulin therapy expose pregnant woman labor induction , prematurity cesarean delivery . In MODY2 woman whose glucose set point physiologically high , glycemic goal difficult achieve often require extensive insulin therapy . An optimal situation would consist initiate insulin therapy woman non-mutated offspring . Unfortunately antenatal diagnosis GCK mutation fetal cell available yet . In literature , birth weight difference mutate non-mutated neonate may reach 700g . In clinical practice , two strategy use without standardized protocol glycemic target , delay dos insulin : 1 ) insulin diagnosis pregnancy 2 ) treatment base fetal abdominal circumference fetal weight measurement ultrasonography ( US ) initiate fetal biometry great 75th percentile . The purpose study evaluate first time two management strategy prospective standardize study . Hypothesis : US assessment would sufficient identify fetus risk macrosomia initiate insulin treatment mother .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Impact Birth Weight Two Therapeutic Strategies ( Insulin Therapy From Beginning Pregnancy vs. Insulin Therapy Initiated According Fetal Growth Evaluated Ultrasonography Measurements ) Pregnant Women With Monogenic Diabetes</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Study design The investigator propose conduct national multicenter prospective study clinical management pregnancy woman GCK mutation . Medical management pregnancy After obtain write informed consent , investigator Diabetes Departments include MODY2 woman , time gestation plan first prenatal appointment . Pre-gestational maternal parameter ( maternal age , pre-gestational weight , blood glucose , mean blood glucose level 2 hour post prandial one week available , HbA1c , parity , medical history macrosomia ) collect . Antenatal care provide accord local routine protocol MODY2 . All woman receive dietary physical activity counsel accord current recommendation pregnant woman pregestational diabetes . Vitamin B9 , 0.4 5 mg/day , accord local habit , prescribe usual care pregestational appointment end first trimester . - Women pregestational HbA1c ≥ 6.5 % systematically treat insulin potential increase malformation rate document woman type 1 diabetes ( Bell , Glinianaia et al . 2012 ) . - In woman pregestational HbA1c &lt; 6.5 % , insulin therapy initiate either accord capillary maternal blood glucose target value accord fetal growth assess ultrasonography , accord Diabetes Department habit . In group , care standardized follow : - Ultrasonography ( US ) examination perform usually 12 , 22 32 gestational week . Additional US perform 25 , 28 , 35 38 gestational week , perform several randomize control trial show strategy allow prevention increase rate macrosomia woman GDM ( Schaefer-Graf , Kjos et al . 2004 ) . A referent sonographer identify center limit inter-examiner variability . At US , fetal biometry ( abdominal circumference fetal weight estimation ) percentile accord gestational age determine . - Blood glucose self-monitoring , comprise 6 measure ( 2 hour begin meal ) , register whole week end three trimester pregnancy . - Women body weight measure pregnancy , Diabetology appointment delivery . - Fetal monitoring perform accord local routine protocol . Modalities delivery decide usual care obstetrics department . No specific gestational age modality delivery recommend study . Group woman insulin therapy begin pregnancy : Treatment conduct accord national guideline GDM ( 2010 ) consist : - Blood glucose self-monitoring 2 hr meal , i.e . 6 test per day . Recommended target less 0.95 g/L meal less 1.20 g/L postprandial . - Diet counseling carbohydrate intake divide three meal two three snack . - After 7-10 day glucose monitoring , insulin therapy institute capillary glucose level exceed target 20 % measurement 40 % single time slot . Each caregiver manage insulin therapy accord local habit ( use long-acting insulin , regular insulin , insulin analog , continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion external pump ) , increase dos order obtain recommend glucose target . Preliminary data suggest high insulin dos may necessary normalize fast blood glucose may difficult . Thus , insulin dos increase case occurrence repeat hypoglycemia ( i.e . 2 mild hypoglycemic episode single slot one week one single severe hypoglycemic episode even blood glucose target achieve ) . Insulin treatment stop case fetal restrict growth define estimate fetal weight &lt; 10th percentile , two consecutive US least 3 week interval etiology . Group woman insulin therapy initiate accord fetal US measurement : Women monitor blood glucose level 2 hour meal twice week whole pregnancy . In group , MODY2 woman treat insulin delivery , except : - fetal abdominal circumference exceeds ≥ 75 percentile one US . This threshold similar one chosen initiate insulin therapy several RCTs show strategy allow prevention increase rate macrosomia woman GDM ( Schaefer-Graf , Kjos et al . 2004 , Kjos Schaefer-Graf 2007 ) . - maternal fasting capillary blood glucose ≥ 1,20 g/L maternal post-prandial capillary blood glucose ≥ 2,00 g/L . In mentioned RCTs , woman follow monthly fetal growth evaluation treat insulin except fetal abdominal circumference ≥ 75th percentile , glucose level exceed safety threshold . No increase macrosomia pregnancy adverse outcome observe use strategy , compare conventional treatment insulin ( Kjos Schaefer-Graf 2007 ) . When initiate , insulin therapy conduct described 11.2 , capillary blood glucose target -Maternal care Systematic visit Diabetes department schedule 2- 4 week interval . A monthly visit Obstetrics department schedule 22 week gestation . Routine care , include measurement weight , height arterial pressure , well urinary test proteinuria perform first appointment follow visit . In case insulin treatment , type dose insulin record , well frequency mild severe hypoglycemia . Women pre-gestational HbA1c &gt; 6.5 % treated insulin pregnancy plan period begin pregnancy describe part 6.2.1 data concern pregnancy register . - Quality life Three self-questionnaires , already use randomize study GDM treatment ( Crowther , Hiller et al . 2005 ) , propose woman first appointment three month post partum . - Maternal health status assess mean Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form General Health Survey ( SF-36 ) , assess eight aspect health status : general mental health , physical social functioning , physical emotional role , pain , vitality . Scores scale range 0 ( bad ) 100 ( best ) . - Maternal anxiety assess use short form Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory , self-rating scale consist 6 item ( score 15 consider normal ) . The presence maternal depression reflect score 12 Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale three month post partum . -Anthropometrics biological measure neonates Anthropometrics parameter record first day life neonate : - Weight determine `` large gestational age '' define birth weight 90th percentile `` small gestational age '' define birth weight 10th percentile sex-specific neonatal growth standard publish AUDIPOG group ( Mamelle et al , 1996 ) - Skin fold 1st 3rd day life ( bicipital , tricipital , scapular , iliac ) department experience type measurement . Capillary blood glucose test collect 3 hour first feed look hypoglycaemia . After second feeding , blood glucose test repeat every 6 hour &gt; 2.5 mmol/L . If blood glucose normal 24 hour feed also normal , neonate glucose monitoring stop . Infants categorize clinical neonatal hypoglycaemia symptom and/or treatment glucose infusion glucose value ≤ 2 mmol/L . C-peptide measured cord blood . Hyperinsulinemia define C-peptide level 90th percentile neonate reference population . Samples centralize single laboratory determination C-peptide level . Neonatal leptin measure cord blood biological marker infant adiposity . Leptin specifically produce adipose tissue placenta , maternal leptin cross placenta . Fetal leptin reflect amount adipose tissue , production could regulate insulin ( Hauguel-de Mouzon , Lepercq et al . 2006 ) . -GCK genotyping In order analyze effect maternal treatment accord fetal genotype , target sequence maternal GCK mutation perform DNA extract blood cord sample . The mother ( partner ) sign inform write consent genetic test baby .</detailed_description>
