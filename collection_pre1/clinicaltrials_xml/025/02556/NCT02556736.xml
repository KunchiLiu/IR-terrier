	<brief_summary>RST-001 gene therapy give injection eye delivers gene encode photo switch , channelrhodopsin-2 , ( optogenetics ) cell retina eye . When express , channelrhodopsin-2 protein depolarize response light thus generate signal transmit brain . The study compose two part . An initial dose-ranging study ( part 1 ) propose whereby three dose level RST-001 study three separate group adult patient advanced disease . This first part study aim determine single dose experimental agent safe well tolerate , evaluate fourth group patient . The second part study aim obtain additional safety data high tolerate dose provide important additional clinical data guide design future efficacy study .</brief_summary>

	<criteria>Inclusion criterion : Participants must meet following criterion . 1 . Age &gt; = 18 year 2 . Signed date write informed consent obtain patient . 3 . Ability comply test protocol test . 4 . Diagnosis advance retinitis pigmentosa ( RP ) define : 1 . Clinical diagnosis advance RP 2 . Prior document retinal electrophysiological evidence rodcone photoreceptor degeneration 3 . Baseline evidence &lt; 10microvolts maximal bwave ERG response 5 . Visual acuity study eye nobetterthan hand motion 6 . Visual acuity nonstudy eye nobetterthan finger count 7 . Presence retinal ganglion cell and/or retinal nerve fiber layer SDOCT test 8 . The presence macular edema due RP consider exclusion criterion 9 . Women childbearing potential must negative pregnancy test screen baseline , agree use effective form contraception , surgically sterile postmenopausal ( define last menstrual period great two year prior baseline . Acceptable method contraception include hormonal contraception ( i.e. , birth control pill , inject hormone , dermal patch vaginal ring ) , intrauterine device , barrier method ( diaphragm , condom ) spermicide , surgical sterilization ( tubal ligation ) . 10 . Males must use two form contraception ( include one barrier method three month follow agent administration partner childbearing potential ) , must surgically sterile . Exclusion criterion : Any one follow exclude patient enrol study : 1 . Unable unwilling meet requirement study ; 2 . Participation clinical study ( ocular nonocular ) investigational drug , agent therapy past six month ; 3 . Concurrent participation another interventional clinical ocular study ; 4 . Prior participation gene stem cell therapy ( ocular ) ; 5 . Preexisting eye condition would preclude plan treatment ( i.e . injection ) interfere interpretation study endpoint surgical complication ( example would include ( limited ) glaucoma , diseases affect optic nerve cause significant visual field loss , active uveitis , corneal lenticular opacity ) ; 6 . Complicating systemic disease clinically significant abnormal baseline laboratory value . Complicating systemic disease would include disease , treatment disease , alter ocular function . Examples malignancy whose treatment could affect central nervous system function ( example , radiation treatment orbit ; leukemia central nervous system/optic nerve involvement ) . Also exclude would subject immunological response dysfunction , example , immunocompromising disease use immunosuppressive medication , among others . Subjects positive hepatitis B , C , HIV exclude . ; 7 . Cataract surgery , intraocular and/or periocular injection study eye within prior six month ; 8 . Prior vitrectomy aphakia study eye ; 9 . Known sensitivity component study agent medication plan use perioperative period . 10 . Current pregnancy breastfeeding ; 11 . Individuals childbearing potential pregnant unwilling use effective contraception duration study ; 12 . Subjects exclude immunological study show presence neutralizing antibody AAV2 1:1000 ; 13 . Use antiplatelet agent may alter coagulation within 28 day prior study agent administration ; 14 . Any condition would allow potential subject complete followup examination course study , opinion investigator , make potential subject unsuitable study .</criteria>
