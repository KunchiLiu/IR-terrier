	<brief_summary>The primary goal Phase II EXTEND trial investigate effect open-label hydroxyurea treatment , escalate maximum tolerated dose , child Sickle Cell Anemia either conditional ( 170 - 199 cm/sec ) abnormal ( ≥200 cm/sec ) Transcranial Doppler velocity . The primary endpoint measure 18 month hydroxyurea treatment continue common study termination date .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Hydroxyurea treatment : Participants treat open-label hydroxyurea , available capsule ( 200 , g , 300 mg , 400 mg , 500 mg ) , liquid formulation ( 100 mg/mL ) . Hydroxyurea administer daily mouth . Participants monitor monthly maximum tolerate dose quarterly thereafter periodic clinical evaluation , laboratory test , transcranial doppler examination every 6 month . Hydroxyurea titrate maximum tolerated dose define mild marrow suppression , even participant clinical well-being lower hydroxyurea dose . The target absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) hydroxyurea therapy &lt; 3.0 x 109/L , marrow suppression also include reduction reticulocyte count . Hydroxyurea dose commence 20 mg/kg/day . Dose escalation occur 5 mg/kg/day increment , adjust every 8 week unless dose-limiting hematological toxicity occurs ( define ANC &lt; 1.0 x 109/L , hemoglobin concentration &lt; 5 gm/dL 20 % baseline , absolute reticulocyte count &lt; 80 x 109/L unless hemoglobin concentration &gt; 9.0 gm/dL , platelet count &lt; 80 x 109/L ) target neutropenia ( ANC &lt; 3.0 x 109/L ) achieve . Based pilot data experience clinical trial , pediatric participant require hydroxyurea dos 20-30 mg/kg/day reach target absolute neutrophil count . After reach maximum tolerate dose , minor hydroxyurea dose adjustment make periodically , necessary base weight change blood count , maintain optimal laboratory response prevent dose-related toxicity . If absolute neutrophil count ( ANC ) rise target range 2 consecutive visit , compliance reinforce dose may adjust 2.5 mg/kg/day eight week interval maximum 35 mg/kg/day 2000 mg/day . For hydroxyurea dosing , current body weight use , dose escalation guide hematological toxicity . Hydroxyurea reduce even temporarily discontinue hematological toxicity , e.g. , ANC &lt; 1.0 x 109/L , hemoglobin &lt; 5.0 gm/dL , 20 % baseline , absolute reticulocyte count &lt; 80 x 109/L unless hemoglobin concentration &gt; 9.0 gm/dL , platelet &lt; 80 x 109/L .</detailed_description>
