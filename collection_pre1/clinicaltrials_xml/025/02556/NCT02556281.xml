	<brief_summary>After curative surgical resection , detection metastatic lymph node remain main prognostic validate criterion base decision adjuvant therapy . To date , none molecular alteration , identify potentially predictive factor , use routine therapeutic decision . The circulate marker , either form free circulate DNA form circulate tumoral cell seem important potential candidate . To investigator knowledge , one study estimate several interesting result prognostic interest couple detection free circulate mutant DNA ( gene KRAS ) hypermethylation p16 gene . Definitive conclusion remain however difficult achieve small number patient include ( n=58 ) fact study include different stage . For colorectal cancer Chinese team present series result suggest presence CTC postoperative course factor significantly relate risk recurrence . In multivariate analysis integrate lymph node status vascular invasion , presence CTC appear independent factor recurrence hazard ratio 29.5 . The aim present study compare prognostic value two circulate tumoral marker KRAS point mutation RASSF2A methylation ( free tumoral DNA ) Circulating tumoral cell ( CTC ) . The primary objective compare sensibility specificity two circulate marker ( free tumoral DNA tumoral cell ) 2 year disease free survival rate . Secondary objective confirm prognostic value circulate free tumoral DNA circulate tumoral cell localise colorectal cancer .</brief_summary>
