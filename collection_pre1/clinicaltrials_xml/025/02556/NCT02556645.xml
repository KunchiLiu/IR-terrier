	<brief_title>A Comparison Web-Prolonged Exposure ( Web-PE ) Present-Centered Therapy ( PCT ) PTSD Among Active-Duty Military Personnel</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Background : It urgent make EBTs military personnel readily accessible order meet grow demand effective efficient treatment PTSD timely manner . Effective EBTs PTSD available , barrier access care deter military personnel access care . Web-treatments represent innovative way overcome barrier . The efficacy previously develop web-treatments PTSD appear promising , however , base treatment protocol strong empirical support efficacy . Hence , discern whether outcome associate exist web-treatments due new intervention factor associate use Internet deliver treatment . No study date examine web-treatment PTSD use well-established treatment program . An important unanswered question whether move traditional , costly , access-limiting , therapist-delivered format effective treatment accessible , cost-effective , web-format impact treatment efficacy . In addition , base evidence show link neurosteroids psychopathology role PTSD treatment response , add-on biomarkers study funded examines role candidate biomarkers [ endogenous glucocorticoid neurosteroids , i.e . cortisol , allopregnanolone ( ALLO ) metabolites , dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA/DHEAS ) ] : ) predictor treatment response , b ) indices therapeutic change PTSD treatment . Objective/Hypotheses : To eliminate confound inherent change simultaneously treatment program mode delivery , investigator propose develop web-version PE , `` Web-PE '' , compare efficacy Present Centered Treatment ( PCT ) , active control comparison . The investigator hypothesize Web-PE efficacious reduce PTSD severity PCT among military personnel return deployment Afghanistan Iraq post-treatment 3- 6-months treatment completion . In addition , investigator expect change cortisol neurosteriods track symptom change . Specific Aims : The first aim develop Web-PE program receive high rating ease use , acceptability , comprehension program content functionality , overall satisfaction military personnel PTSD symptom advisory board eight expert PE treatment PTSD military . The second aim examine efficacy Web-PE compare therapist-delivered PCT follow outcome : 1 ) Change PTSD severity diagnostic status pre- post-treatment ; 2 ) Change symptom depression , anger , frequently co-occurring problem pre- post-treatment . The biological aim study include : 1 ) To identify specific neuroendocrine neurosteroid change `` track '' Posttraumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) symptom change course effective treatment 2 ) determine specificity Prolonged Exposure ( PE ) -induced neuroendocrine/neurosteroid change directly compare pattern change PE Present Centered Therapy ( PCT ) . Study Design : During Phase I ( month 0-9 ) , investigator develop demonstrate feasibility Web-PE program pilot 10 military personnel PTSD subclinical PTSD member expert advisory board . During Phase II ( month 9-36 ) , investigator conduct RCT compare efficacy Web-PE therapist-delivered PCT measure PTSD symptom severity relate psychopathology 160 OIF/OEF active duty military personnel PTSD . Cortisol Awakening Response collect home three morning prior research session occur baseline , week 4 , one three month follow-up . Script driven imagery saliva collection salivary cortisol response general environment specific trauma cue baseline , week 4 , one three month follow-up . Serum neurosteriods ( allopregnanolone , pregnenolone , pregnanolone , androsterone , DHEA ) baseline , week 4 1 month follow-up treatment . Relevance : Untreated PTSD become chronic disorder , leave military service-men -women less effective unable perform military duty , likely comorbid mental physical health problem well difficulty daily function ( Vasterling et al. , 2007 ) . The proposed Web-PE program function first step step care model . As expect greatly facilitate dissemination EBT need capitalize great accessibility , cost-effectiveness , anonymity afford Internet . Thus , propose study directly target MOM/JPC interest research aim develop validate novel EBTs exploit innovative telemedicine technology . Because Web-PE could access home , propose study also relevant MOM/ JPC interest strategy reduce stigma associate PTSD treatment . Integrating affective neuroscience method RCT make study informative , effective , less expensive two independent study . Neurobiological study PTSD link specific candidate biomarkers [ endogenous glucocorticoid neurosteroids , i.e . cortisol , allopregnanolone ( ALLO ) metabolites , dehydroepiandrosterone ( DHEA/DHEAS ) ] PTSD severity potentially treatment response . Identifying mechanism involve treatment response assist improve therapeutic technique target specific neurobiological process involve .
