	<brief_summary>Respiratory dysfunction lead cause death individual spinal cord injury ( SCIs ) . Nearly one quarter SCI case involve injury upper spinal cord segment impairs neural activation diaphragm muscle compromise breathe . Although mechanical ventilation life-saving cervical SCI ( C-SCI ) , also trigger rapid profound diaphragm muscle atrophy , thereby complicate ( even prevent ) ventilator wean . Intramuscular diaphragm stimulation , diaphragm pacing , develop replace long-term ventilator support , use acutely post C-SCI ( &lt; 4 month follow injury ) promote ventilator wean . The impact diaphragm pace respiratory function diaphragm muscle activation formally evaluate . This essential step determine efficacy intramuscular diaphragm stimulation effect respiratory function SCI . Accordingly , research study evaluate effect intramuscular diaphragm stimulation test hypothesis diaphragm pace enhances neuromuscular diaphragm activation respiratory function adult cervical SCIs . The investigator test hypothesis evaluate effect diaphragm pace neuromuscular activation diaphragm directly record electromyogram ( EMG ) activity intramuscular pacing electrode . Recording surgically-implanted electrode allows direct comparison EMG activity across time , minimize methodological limitation inherent surface percutaneous EMG recording . This approach , association respiratory assessment , use investigate impact diaphragm pace adult intramuscular diaphragm pace electrode follow acute , traumatic C-SCIs .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Subject recruitment . Patients acute , traumatic C-SCIs , schedule receive intramuscular diaphragm pacing OR recently receive diaphragm pacer ( within past 5-days ) recruit two Level-1 trauma hospital serve North Florida - UF Health Shands Hospitals Gainesville Jacksonville , Florida . Enrollment . Patients acute , traumatic C-SCIs ( AIS A-C , affect C1-C6 segment ) schedule undergo recently receive implantation diaphragm pace electrode ( within recent 5-days ) identify investigator . After obtain informed consent participation study , member study team review participant 's medical record obtain study-related data verify participant meet study criterion . Clinical test sensory motor function also may conduct verify participant 's SCI classification extent SCI . The test sensory motor function part American Spinal Injury Association ( ASIA ) Impairment Scale International Standards Neurological Classification Spinal Cord Injury . These clinical assessment part standard clinical care include test sensation ( dermatome ) muscle strength via manual muscle test ( myotomes ) . These test do clinically determine segmental level spinal cord demonstrate normal impaired function . These test also aid determine SCI clinically complete incomplete . Determination complete versus incomplete base sensory motor function low sacral segment control sensation motor function anal sphincter . Respiratory function assess measurement maximal expiratory pressure standard spirometry ( tidal breathing , maximal voluntary ventilation flow-volume curve ) . Following enrollment implantation diaphragm pace electrode , individual assess regular interval . Assessments include : . ) clinical ASIA neurologic examination sensory motor function ( describe ) b . ) record intramuscular diaphragm EMGs c. ) measurement diaphragm muscle strength via standard clinical assessment maximal inspiratory pressure d. ) standard clinical measure respiratory function . Up 5 assessment conduct acute hospital setting ; 5 assessment inpatient rehabilitation ( Brooks Rehabilitation ) ; 4 assessment conduct discharge home setting . ASSESSMENT OVERVIEW : The examination allow investigator characterize longitudinal change segmental sensory motor function . Diaphragm electromyogram ( EMG ) record intramuscular diaphragm pace electrode respiratory function assess non-stimulated respiration ( diaphragm pace unit turn ) . Diaphragm EMGs record intramuscular pacing electrode custom connector attache external pacing electrode wire interfaces EMG acquisition system . Concurrent EMG recording , assessment include test maximal inspiratory pressure assess diaphragm muscle strength . Assessment neuromuscular activation diaphragm perform . Neuromuscular activation diaphragm assess record diaphragm EMGs surgically-implanted intramuscular stimulating electrode . This approach allow comparison EMG recording across time reduces methodological limitation associate surface percutaneous EMG approach . EMGs record non-stimulated respiration ( diaphragm pacer turn ) simultaneously assessments respiratory function . These assessment may include maximal inspiratory pressure ; sniff nasal inspiratory pressure , maximal expiratory pressure , assessment rest tidal breathing , inspiration total lung capacity , maximal voluntary ventilation measurement flow volume use standard spirometry . During assessment , photograph and/or video recording may obtain . These recording do participant 's knowledge consent type recording obtain . Photographs video recording use communicate study procedure study team monitor assessment process . Video photographic data use assess individual SCIs perform respond test communicate study procedure . Video photographic information use manner base level consent obtain participant . Primary outcome characterize neuromuscular activation diaphragm ass change diaphragm activation associate intramuscular diaphragm stimulation include : amplitude timing characteristic ( raw , filtered EMGs normalize ) ; neural respiratory drive evaluate diaphragm muscle activation tidal breathe relative activation capacity maximal inspiratory maneuver ; time-frequency characteristic diaphragm EMGs ( wavelet analysis ) .</detailed_description>
