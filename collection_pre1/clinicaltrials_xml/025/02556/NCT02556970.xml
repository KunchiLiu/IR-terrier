	<brief_summary>This study seek establish thoracoscopic surgery perform single port incision reduces early post-operative pain compare conventional multiple port thoracoscopic surgery . This initial pilot study design establish whether trial two technique acceptable patient , clinically feasible deliver reasonable timescale .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>A Study Investigating Pain Following Single-port Multi-port Video Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>This patient- assessor-blinded , multi-centre randomise trial two group ( n=20 arm ) . Patients refer Universities Hospital Bristol NHS Foundation Trust ( n=20 ) Liverpool Heart Chest Hospital NHS Foundation Trust ( n=20 ) require elective VATS lung surgery . Patients identify recruited thoracic surgeon surgical outpatient clinic . Participants receive verbal write information two different surgical technique . Consent seek one surgical research nurse surgical outpatient clinic thoracic surgeon recruit . On rare occasion possible , consent occur pre-operative assessment clinic ( POAC ) later date . All patient see POAC least 1 week prior surgery except extreme circumstance . In POAC consent also seek one surgical research nurse . Participants give contact detail study team question consent surgery . They able withdraw consent time prior surgery . All data enter Trust-based computer password protect . Subject name keep database link study identification number research . There patient identifier . Only research team access computer . Data store locked office maintain minimum five year completion study . Participants block randomise 1:1 block 10 single port surgery multiple port surgery . Randomisation occur computer generation theatre induction anaesthesia use website www.sealedenvelope.com . The treatment arm involve performance plan surgical procedure single incision chest wall , without rib spreading . The camera instrument place single incision . Use soft tissue retractor permit . The control arm undergo operation standard 3-incision approach , without rib spreading . All patient receive skin dressing match multi-port technique , irrespective randomise allocation . Patients informed remove dressing first 24 hour . Surgical anaesthetic staff member inform communicate information treatment allocation patient nursing staff . The patient nursing staff undertake pain assessment aware group allocation first 24 hour . The research nurse collect data also blind . The anaesthetic surgical team involve practically blind involve outcome data collection . All patient receive simple intra-operative analgesia form 1g intravenous paracetamol 75mg intravenous diclofenac unless patient 70 abnormal renal function . Extra opioid analgesia give intravenous fentanyl morphine titrate anaesthetist . The amount give documented part trial data . At end procedure , multiple level ( target least 4 ) intercostal block place subpleurally thoracoscopic visualisation . 2ml 2.5mg/ml Chirocaine ( Levobupivicaine hydrochloride ) inject space . Post-operative analgesia compromise 1g paracetamol four time day first 3 day surgery . Patient receive IV morphine titrate pain recovery oramorph return ward . If patient significant pain morphine patient control analgesia ( PCA ) set recovery first night surgery ( 1mg bolus , lockout 5mins ) . This normally discontinue first morning surgery . The following data record patient enrol study : Pre-operatively : â€¢ At consent , baseline quality life score record . Intra-operatively : The following time record sticker attach patient 's anaesthetic chart : - Time induction anaesthesia - Time knife skin - Time skin closure - Time extubation - Time arrived recovery These time record research nurse allow total surgical time ( induction skin closure ) total operative time ( knife skin skin closure ) calculate . Post-operative period ( expect 36-48 hour post-surgery ) : - Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) pain score routinely record recovery nurse ward nurse every hour first 24 hour post operatively subsequently every 4 hour discharge . So assuming time recovery time zero investigator collect pain score time zero every hour first 24 hour . The investigator collect pain score every 4 hour discharge . - Patient satisfaction survey conduct day 1 day 2 post-op . - Total morphine consumption prior discharge record . - Time discharge . - Length time chest drain remain situ . - Volume blood loss chest drain first 24 hour . At 30 day : - All patient complete telephone quality life score . - Serious adverse event record first 30 day : - Death - Readmission hospital - Re-operation - Admission ICU</detailed_description>
