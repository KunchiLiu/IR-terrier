	<brief_title>Efficacy Safety HyQvia ( Immunoglobulin 10 % With Recombinant Hyaluronidase ) Multifocal Motor Neuropathy ( MMN )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Subcutaneous immunoglobulin ( SCIG ) therapy MMN equally efficacious intravenous immunoglobulin ( IGIV ) , may self-induced may induce few systemic adverse reaction . Limited SC infusion volume reduce bioavailability , however , necessitate multiple infusion site , frequent treatment , dose adjustment achieve pharmacokinetic equivalence . This issue particular MMN relatively high frequent dos necessary maintain long-term improvement muscle strength . Recombinant human hyaluronidase ( rHuPH20 ) increase subcutaneous tissue permeability facilitate dispersion absorption , enable subcutaneous administration high ( monthly ) dose Ig . If treatment HyQvia least equally effective safe compare conventional Ig treatment , HyQvia could become preferred treatment option patient MMN may attractive benefit patient mode administration .</detailed_description>
