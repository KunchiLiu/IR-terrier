	<brief_summary>The molecular mechanism participate various aspect DNA Damage Response ( DDR ) absolutely essential maintain genome dynamic essential living organism . The commonly study consequence faulty DDR genome instability participate cancer onset . In present proposal , wish explore another aspect DDR , relevant cancer , absolute requirement several key step development , maturation , function immune system . The `` spectacular '' consequence faulty DNA repair process respect immuno-hematopoietic tissue complete block B T lymphocytes maturation owe defective DNA join phase V ( D ) J recombination result patient Severe Combined Immune Deficiency ( SCID ) . The objective study increase knowledge role various DNA repair process development , maintenance , function immune system thus , good understand dysfunction DNA repair process result human severe condition CVID , LOCID manifestation immune disorder autoimmunity . The exploration DNA repair mechanisms patient allow u establish genetic diagnosis patient undefined molecular diagnosis . This immediate importance patient family , contributes well understand patient ' condition , also allow provide genetic counseling family .</brief_summary>
