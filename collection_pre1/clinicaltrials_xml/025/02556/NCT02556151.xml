	<brief_summary>Fecal Incontinence ( FI ) affect 8-15 % US population , predominantly woman elderly , 45 % nursing home resident . It significantly impair quality life pose major health care burden . FI characterize significant neuromuscular dysfunction pelvic floor include bilateral lumbo-anorectal sacro-anorectal neuropathy sensori-motor dysfunction . This multifactorial etiology suggest maladaptive neuroplastic change neural innervation lower gastrointestinal tract could play significant role pathogenesis FI . A critical barrier progress treatment FI lack understanding treatment affect core pathophysiological mechanism FI , absence mechanistically base non-invasive therapy . Our goal address problem FI develop therapy modulate peripheral central neuronal perturbation thereby improve visceromotor control sensori-motor dysfunction , understand neurobiologic basis treatment . Our central hypothesis novel non-invasive treatment consist repetitive translumbar magnetic stimulation ( rTLMS ) repetitive transsacral magnetic stimulation ( rTSMS ) significantly improve FI enhance peripheral central neural excitability provide multidimensional therapeutic benefit- enhance anal muscle strength , improve stool perception improve rectal capacity . Our approach base preliminary study suggest repetitive translumbar magnetic stimulation ( rTLMS ) transsacral magnetic stimulation ( rTSMS ) improve anorectal pain neuropathy induce central neuroplastic change . Our objective : 1. address significant gap knowledge regard peripheral central neuroenteric axis perturbation afferent efferent neural signal affect FI ; 2. develop new treatment FI repetitive magnetic stimulation determine feasibility , safety optimal frequency set rTLMS rTSMS ; 3. determine mechanistic basis neuromodulation therapy ; 4. identify locus improvement lie afferent efferent signaling .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Our expect outcome include development new treatment approach FI mechanistically base , effective , safe , low cost , less invasive , low risk less dependent patient compliance . The impact project include new non-invasive treatment modality FI , scientific basis development treatment improve understanding peripheral central neuroenteric axis FI . Aim 1 : Test hypothesis neuromodulation therapy combine repetitive translumbar magnetic stimulation ( rTLMS ) transsacral magnetic stimulation ( rTSMS ) improve symptoms FI patient . Investigators evaluate efficacy , safety optimal frequency set rTLMS rTSMS FI investigate whether 6 session weekly therapy 1 Hz 5Hz 15 Hz magnetic stimulation lumbar sacral region provide therapeutic response FI patient . Investigators randomize 48 patient FI ass symptom anorectal function . The primary outcome measure reduction number episodes FI . The secondary outcome measure ) bowel symptoms/severity ( FISI , FICA ) , ii ) quality-of-life ( FI-QOL ) , iii ) psychosocial function , iv ) anal sphincter pressure , v ) rectal sensation , vi ) rectal compliance . A safety assessment monitor adverse effect . Aim 2 : Test hypothesis repetitive translumbar magnetic stimulation ( rTLMS ) transsacral magnetic stimulation ( rTSMS ) improve FI symptom anorectal function modulation ascend descend signal pathway neuroenteric axis . Investigators investigate mechanistic basis rTLMS/rTSMS therapy examine neuroenteric axis . Investigators examine rectal anal motor evoke potential ( MEPs ) 48 FI patient transcranial , translumbar transsacral magnetic stimulation ( descend signal ) , 6 session therapy 1 Hz 5 Hz 15 Hz magnetic stimulation . Also , investigator examine cortical evoke potential ( CEP ) anal rectal stimulation ( ascend signal ) . investigator determine whether rTLMS rTSMS therapy shorten latency increase amplitude area curve ( AUC ) anal rectal MEPs ano-cortical recto-cortical CEPs compare baseline . Investigators identify locus improvement lie afferent signaling , efferent signal whether neuroplastic change central peripheral . The primary outcome measure efferent signal latency lumbo-anal sacro-anal MEP response afferent signal latency ano-cortical CEP . Secondary outcome measure include anal rectal electrical sensory threshold , lumbo-rectal sacro-rectal MEPs recto-cortical CEPs correlation FI episodes bowel symptom change latency MEP measurement . Participants maintain two week prospective fecal incontinence symptom diary . Baseline questionnaires administer . Patients demonstrate least one episode fecal incontinence per week , average , eligible , pending eligibility criterion meet . Patients come brain-gut assessment ( ) well baseline anorectal manometry ( need per protocol specification ) . Patients randomize one three hertz group treatment one within one week baseline assessment . A total six weekly treatment ( +7 day window allow ) , occur . After six treatment , patient baseline assessment repeat ( brain-gut assessment , anorectal manometry questionnaire ) .</detailed_description>
