	<brief_summary>The purpose study evaluate progression free survival ( PFS ) , base independent radiologic review ( IRR ) , ASP8273 compare erlotinib gefitinib patient locally advance , metastatic unresectable stage IIIB/IV adenocarcinoma non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) activate mutation . This study also assess Overall survival ( OS ) ; Overall response rate ( ORR ) assess IRR ; PFS assess investigator ; Disease control rate ( DCR ) assess IRR ; Duration Response ( DOR ) IRR ; Safety ASP8273 ; Quality Life ( QOL ) patient-reported outcome ( PRO ) parameter .</brief_summary>
