	<brief_summary>This study intend men woman least 18 year age advance lung cancer grown return treat . In particular , study subject blood test positive HLA-A*0201 , HLA-A*205 and/or HLA-A*0206 protein tumor test positive NY-ESO-1 expression ( protein gene ) . The study take subject 's T cell , natural type immune cell blood , send laboratory modify . The changed T cell use study subject 's T cell genetically change aim attack destroy cancer cell . The manufacturing T cell take 1 month complete . The T cell give back subject intravenous infusion . The purpose study test safety genetically change T cell find effect , , subject lung cancer . Subjects see frequently Study Physician right receive T cell back . Subjects enter long-term follow order monitor subject . Subjects see every 6 month Study Physician first 5 year T cell infusion . If T cell find blood five year , subject continue see year T cell longer find blood maximum 15 year . If T cell longer find blood 5 year , subject contact Study Physician next 10 year .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>This single-arm study genetically engineer NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cell HLA-A*0201 , HLA-A*0205 and/or HLA-A*0206 positive subject advance ( Stage IIIb IV ) NSCLC . Subjects measurable disease screen general health , performance status disease stage . Following screening , subject meet eligibility undergo large-volume leukapheresis obtain cell manufacture autologous NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹ TCR bear T cell . When NY-ESO-1ᶜ²⁵⁹T cell available , subject receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy cyclophosphamide fludarabine Day -7 , Day -6 Day -5 follow cell infusion Day 1 . Subjects visit clinic safety efficacy assessment daily T cell infusion ( Day 1 ) Day 5 , Days 8 , 10 , 12 , weekly week 6 8 , 10 , 12 , 16 , 20 24 week , every 3 month 2 year every 6 month progression disease ( withdrawal consent interventional portion study ) Subjects confirm response ( stable disease &gt; 4 month ) subsequent disease progression follow initial infusion whose tumor continue express appropriate antigen target may eligible second infusion . All subject , complete withdraw interventional portion study , enter 15-year long-term follow-up phase observation delay adverse event . All subject continue follow overall survival long-term follow-up phase .</detailed_description>

	<criteria>1 . Subject voluntarily agree participate give write informed consent 2 . Subject ≥18 year age 3 . Histologically cytologically confirm diagnosis advance nonsmall cell lung cancer ( stage IIIB IV ) recurrent disease . Subjects known EGFR mutation ALK ROS1 gene rearrangement must also fail prior EGFR ALK ROS1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor , respectively ( PD unacceptable toxicity ) . Subjects may receive PD1 PDL1 inhibitor . There limit line prior anticancer therapy . 4 . Measurable disease accord RECIST 1.1 criterion . 5 . Subject must HLAA*02:01 , HLAA*02:05 and/or HLAA*02:06 positive . 6 . Subject 's tumor ( either archival specimen fresh biopsy archival tissue unavailable ) pathologically review designated central laboratory confirm NYESO1 and/or LAGE1a expression . 7 . ECOG Performance Status 01 anticipate life expectancy &gt; 3 month . 8 . All subject must leave ventricular ejection fraction ≥50 % . 9 . Subject fit leukapheresis adequate venous access cell collection . 10 . Female subject childbearing potential ( FPCP ) must negative urine serum pregnancy test . NOTE : FPCP define premenopausal surgically sterilize . FPCP must agree use maximally effective birth control abstain heterosexual activity throughout study , start first dose chemotherapy 12 month infusion cell and/or 4 month evidence persistence/gene modify cell blood , whichever longer . Effective contraceptive method include intrauterine device , oral and/or injectable hormonal contraception , 2 adequate barrier method ( e.g . diaphragm spermicide , cervical cap spermicide , female condom spermicide ) . Spermicides alone adequate method contraception . Or Male subject must surgically sterile agrees use double barrier contraception method abstain heterosexual activity female childbearing potential upon enrolment start first dose chemotherapy 4 month thereafter longer ( indicated country specific monograph/label cyclophosphamide . 11 . Subject must adequate organ function indicate follow laboratory value table : Absolute Neutrophil count ( ANC ) ≥1.0 x10⁹/L ( without GCSF support ) Platelets ≥ 75 x10⁹/L Hemoglobin &gt; 80 g/dL ( without transfusion support within 7 day start leukapheresis ) Prothrombin Time INR ≤1.5x upper limit normal ( ULN ) unless receive therapeutic anticoagulation . Partial Thromboplastin Time ( PTT ) ≤1.5x upper limit normal ( ULN ) unless receive therapeutic anticoagulation . Calculated measured creatinine clearance ≥ 40 mL/min Serum total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN ( unless subject document Gilbert 's Syndrome ) Alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) /Serum Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase ( SGPT ) ≤2.5x ULN 1 . Subject cytotoxic chemotherapy within 3 week prior leukapheresis ; immune therapy biological therapy within 4 week prior leukapheresis ; corticosteroid immunosuppressive therapy within 2 week prior leukapheresis ; tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) ( e.g . erlotinib , gefitinib ) anticancer treatment within 1 week prior leukapheresis . 2 . Toxicity previous anticancer therapy recover ≤Grade 1 prior enrollment ( except nonclinically significant toxicity , e.g. , alopecia , vitiligo ) . Subjects exist pneumonitis result radiation exclude ; however , subject oxygen dependent . 3 . History allergic reaction attribute compound similar chemical biologic composition cyclophosphamide , fludarabine , agent use study . 4 . Investigational treatment within 4 week prior leukapheresis ; experimental anticancer vaccine within 2 month prior leukapheresis absence response opinion Investigator respond experimental vaccine give within 6 month prior leukapheresis ; prior gene therapy use integrate vector . 5 . History chronic recurrent ( within last year prior enrollment ) severe autoimmune active immunemediated disease require steroid immunosuppressive treatment . 6 . Subject active brain metastasis leptomeningeal metastasis . Subjects prior history brain metastasis undergone local therapy ( i.e. , metastasectomy and/or radiation ) show evidence local recurrence progression past 3 month prior Screening eligible . 7 . Other active malignancy besides NSCLC within 3 year prior Screening . Exceptions : adequately treat malignancy likely require therapy ( e.g. , completely resect nonmelanomatous skin carcinoma successfully treat situ carcinoma ) . Subjects must complete remission prior malignancy order eligible enter study . 8 . Unintended weight loss &gt; 10 % 6 month precede study entry . 9 . Electrocardiogram ( ECG ) show clinically significant abnormality Screening show average QTc interval ≥450 msec male ≥470 msec female ( ≥480 msec subject Bundle Branch Block ( BBB ) 3 consecutive ECGs ) . 10 . Uncontrolled intercurrent illness include , limited : Ongoing active infection ; Clinically significant cardiac disease define CHF New York Heart Association ( NYHA ) Class &gt; 1 ; uncontrolled clinically significant arrhythmia last 6 month ; Acute Coronary Syndrome ( ACS ) ( angina MI ) last 6 month . Inadequate pulmonary function mechanical parameter &lt; 40 % predict ( FEV1 , FVC , TLC , DLCO ) . Interstitial lung disease ( subject exist pneumonitis result radiation exclude , however , subject oxygen dependent ) . Subjects opinion Investigator unlikely fully comply protocol requirement . Clinically significant psychiatric illness/social situation would limit compliance study requirement . 11 . Active infection HIV , HBV , HCV HTLV minimally define : Positive serology HIV . Active hepatitis B infection determine hepatitis B surface antigen . Active hepatitis C infection determine hepatitis C RNA ; A subject HCV antibody positive screen HCV RNA RT polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) bDNA assay . If HCV antibody positive , eligibility determine base negative screen RNA value . Positive serology HTLV 1 2 . Furthermore prior lymphodepleting chemotherapy , subject meeting follow criterion eligible participation study : 1 . Subject cytotoxic chemotherapy within 3 week prior lymphodepleting chemotherapy ; immune therapy ( include monoclonal antibody therapy , checkpoint inhibitor biological therapy within 4 week prior lymphodepleting chemotherapy ; corticosteroid immunosuppressive therapy within 2 week prior lymphodepleting chemotherapy ; tyrosine kinase inhibitor ( TKI ) ( e.g . erlotinib , gefitinib ) within 1 week prior lymphodepleting chemotherapy . 2 . Radiotherapy involve lung mediastinum within 3 month prior chemotherapy . ( Note : washout period palliative radiation nontarget organ lung mediastinum . If radiation intend target lesion within 3 month baseline image study , lesion progress within time frame may consider target lesion review discussion Sponsor . )</criteria>
