	<brief_summary>In last year , research hepatic complication chemotherapy focus hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) . With adequate prophylaxis monitor , HBV-related hepatitis flare prevent . In contrast , cancer patient hepatitis C virus ( HCV ) infection traditionally consider relative safe receive chemotherapy . However , two large retrospective study recently show severe hepatitis could develop 14-27 % lymphoma patient chronic HCV infection , include 3-4 % hepatic failure . The risk factor predict severe hepatitis pre-treatment elevate ALT level liver cirrhosis . Due lack prospective study , dynamic change serum HCV RNA level association hepatitis still unclear . Some epidemiologic study demonstrate association HCV infection B-cell lymphoma . Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL ) common lymphoma several report show high prevalence HCV infection among DLBCL patient control . HCV infect DLBCL patient report distinct clinical characteristic , old , elevate LDH level , extra-nodal involvement . Regarding impact HCV infection prognosis , result conflict . Taiwan endemic area HCV limit report address clinical characteristic prognosis unique population . Therefore , investigator initiate prospective , multi-center observational study clarify dynamic association serum HCV RNA level hepatitis HCV-infected lymphoma patient treat chemotherapy .</brief_summary>
