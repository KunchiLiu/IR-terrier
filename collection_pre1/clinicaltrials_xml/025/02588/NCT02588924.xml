	<brief_summary>The Department Experimental Medicine - Section Hygiene , Occupational Medicine , Forensic Medicine Second University Naples , Section Neurology Second University Naples Mediterranean Neurological Institute NEUROMED , IRCCS involve realization research project aim study correlation environmental occupational exposure metal ( copper , iron manganese ) Parkinson disease order increase knowledge possible risk factor highlight eventual predictive-diagnostic meaning possible discrepancy content element ; secondly collect data could use assess association ( odd ratio-OR ) pathologies different risk factor ( example smoking habit , professional exposure ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Study Relationship Between Environmental Occupational Exposure Metals Parkinson 's Disease</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During selection sample essential consider variable could provoke alteration level indicator examine biological fluid investigate . The adoption strict criterion inclusion exclusion , differ metal metal , therefore necessary establish presence / absence possible confounding factor could affect analysis interpretation data . It note also number require participant study MB must sufficiently large allow adequate statistical analysis : limited group subject include study , broad variability data due inter-individual methodological difference . In light , variable , age sex , firstly neglect potential confounding factor consider , example , smoke habit . Based purpose research project , follow criterion exclusion consider : - disease may interfere toxicokinetics analyzed metal ; - pharmacological therapy ; - habit-forming additive consumption ( excessive alcohol consumption ) ; - alter physiological state ( pregnancy , strenuous physical exercise , recent meal , stress , psychological disorder ) ; On contrary , basic criterion inclusion study : - age : subject work age , 18 65 year ; - diagnosis Parkinson 's disease ( use criterion `` London Brain Bank '' ) Regarding criterion partition stratification subject , type number possible partition condition sample size ; indeed essential ensure sufficient number case ( possible similar number case ) various layer correct statistical result . It recommend minimum number subject per layer must equal 80 . In order collect necessary information inclusion subject study subsequent stratification data , anonymous questionnaire realize administer recruit subject . The questionnaire deal environment lifestyle work habit every participant consist multiple choice question free response question divide macro area : identification data data processing ; place residence ; professional activity ; extraprofessional activity ; eat habit ; habit-forming additive consumption ; medical history . Each question transform `` continue '' `` categorical '' variable order able build constantly update database summarize collect data allow statistical analysis result . Each subject enrol also ask sign consent form , state voluntarily take part study , inform purpose study analysis biological sample personal data . The guarantee anonymity people recruit study provide anonymous questionnaire contain personal data , collect consent form , separately questionnaire .</detailed_description>
