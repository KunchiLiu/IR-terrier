	<brief_title>Hyaluronic Acid v Platelet Rich Plasma : Effects Clinical Outcomes Intra-articular Biology Treatment Knee Osteoarthritis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The objective double-blind prospective randomize clinical trial compare effect PRP HA patient mild moderate OA use biologic clinical correlate outcomes associate treatment OA . The investigator test null hypothesis difference clinical outcome measure validated clinical score system OA , difference intra-articular biology group patient treat HA treat PRP time . This study prospective , randomize , double blind , comparative clinical trial allocation ratio 1:1 underwent IRB approval principal institution . Between 2011 2014 patient screened participation . All comer diagnosis osteoarthritis knee 18 80 year age screen . Treatment Evaluation Patients meet inclusion criterion randomize via electronic randomization process two group : one receive intra-articular PRP , intra-articular HA . Non-clinical staff perform randomization , clinical staff perform injection , result analysis perform primary research team . Patients primary research team perform analysis blind assignment . All patient undergo 10 ml blood draw PRP preparation 3 ml peripheral blood draw complete blood count leukocyte differential . This performed patient receive HA maintain patient blind characterize peripheral white blood cell ( WBC ) platelet count . A complete blood count ( CBC ) complete PRP prior injection evaluate fold increase platelet concentration confirm rarity red white blood cell . A synovial fluid aspirate approximately 2cc perform ultrasound guidance prior PRP HA injection ELISA analysis basal post-treatment intra-articular environment . After treatment , patient instruct limit use leg least 24 hour use cold therapy/icing discomfort . During treatment period rest mild exertion activity ( exercise bike , aquatic therapy ) recommend , follow gradual return sport recreational activity tolerate .</detailed_description>
