	<detailed_description>Clinical trial conduct determine efficacy safety Leukocyte- Platelet-Rich Plasma ( L-PRP ) prepare Biomet Recover L-PRP Mini Platelet Separation Kit treatment tendinosis control setting . This study allow capture evaluation real-world clinical data chronic LE patient population . The advantage post-market data collection provide way examine clinical patient report outcomes along associated cost chronic LE treatment diverse , clinically-relevant population . Although several registry exist capture outcome follow tendon/ligament reconstruction surgery , know registry capture outcomes follow non-surgical treatment chronic LE Recover L-PRP . This study fill gap allow efficient data collection platform large heterogeneous population patient suffer chronic LE document closely examine treatment effect Recover L-PRP .</detailed_description>
