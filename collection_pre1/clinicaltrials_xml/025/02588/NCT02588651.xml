	<brief_summary>This study include patient mature T-cell lymphoma ( MTCL ) treat least one type chemotherapy , respond come back previous treatment . This clinical trial use drug call Brentuximab Vedotin . The Food Drug Administration ( FDA ) approve Brentuximab Vedotin sale United States certain disease . Brentuximab still study clinical trial like one learn side effect whether effective disease condition study . Brentuximab Vedotin type drug call antibody drug conjugate ( ADC ) . ADCs usually 2 part ; part target cancer cell ( antibody ) cell kill part ( chemotherapy ) . Antibodies proteins part immune system . They stick attack specific target cell . The antibody part Brentuximab Vedotin stick target call CD30 . CD30 important molecule cancer cell ( include non Hodgkin lymphoma ) normal cell immune system . The cell kill part Brentuximab Vedotin chemotherapy call monomethyl auristatin E ( MMAE ) . It kill cell antibody part Brentuximab Vedotin stick . Brentuximab Vedotin also show kill cancer cell level CD30 see traditional method . This study do test study drug effect Mature T cell Lymphoma low level target call CD30 disease respond study drug .</brief_summary>
