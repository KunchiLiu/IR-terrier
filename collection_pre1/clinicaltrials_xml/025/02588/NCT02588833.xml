	<detailed_description>This Phase Ib , open-label , multiple ascend dose , pilot study patient PNH receive eculizumab ( Soliris ) ® past . Two cohort 3 subject plan evaluation . Safety assess throughout study ; serial blood urine sample collect assessment . Blood sample collect assessment APL 2 PK . Additional sample assessment PD also collect . The study consist four part ; - Part 1 : subject receive APL-2 28 day . - Part 2A : subject may continue receive APL-2 56 day evidence perceive clinical benefit follow review available safety , PK PD data investigator sponsor - Part 2B : subject may continue receive daily APL-2 treatment 364 day ongoing evidence clinical benefit follow review available safety , PK PD data . - Part 3 : Safety follow Screening take place within 30 day prior start dose Day 1 . If need ( see inclusion criterion ) , Neisseria menigitides type A , C , W , Y B ( administer two separate vaccination ) , Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 23 ( PCV13 PPSV23 , respectively ) , Haemophilus influenzae Type B ( Hib ) vaccination administer least 14 day prior dose Day 1 . Subjects enter Part 1 study Day 1 time designate PI . During Part 1 , first 3 daily SC dose APL-2 ( Day 1 3 ) well dose Day 8 , 15 22 administered clinical site . From Day 4 Day 28 daily dos APL-2 administered off-site train study nurse subject 's home , workplace , location convenient subject exception day dose clinical site . Following ongoing review available safety , PK PD data investigator sponsor , subject show evidence perceive clinical benefit may progress Part 2A Part 2B study continue receive daily dos APL 2 Day 84 Day 364 . Cohort 2 initiated subject Cohort 1 reach Day 29 visit SMC review emerge safety efficacy data determine , initial dose , APL-2 acceptable safety tolerability profile . The planned length participation study subject Cohort 2 approximately 444 day ( 14.5 month ) Day 30 completion Day 414 Exit visit procedure ) . The study plan take place approximately 24 month ( screen Cohort 1 completion Cohort 2 ) .
