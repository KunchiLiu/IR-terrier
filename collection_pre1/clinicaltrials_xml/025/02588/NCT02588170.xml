	<brief_title>Phase III Study Sulfatinib Treating Advanced Extrapancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>273 patient randomly assign ( 2:1 ratio ) Sulfatinib Placebo treatment group base interactive web response system（IWRS ) .The patient receive continuous oral treatment , every 28-day treatment cycle progression disease occur , intolerable toxicity protocol specify end-o-treatment criterion meet . The tumor assess every 8 week ( +/-3 day ) within first year every 12 week ( +/-3 day ) patient treat one year . A Blinded Independent Image Review Committee ( BIIRC ) subsequently provide central review oncologic image material patient . An independent Data Monitoring Committee ( IDMC ) assemble monitor safety efficacy data , evaluate interim analysis . If interim analysis demonstrate overwhelming efficacy treatment arm respect PFS ( primary endpoint ) versus control arm , IDMC could recommend terminate unblinding study sulfatinib offer control arm patient still treatment disease progression intolerable toxicity .</detailed_description>
