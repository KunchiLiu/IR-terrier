	<brief_title>A Study Tremelimumab Combined With Anti-PD-L1 MEDI4736 Antibody Malignant Mesothelioma ( NIBIT-MESO-1 )</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The prognosis malignant mesothelioma ( MM ) patient remain dismal effective treatment represent high un-met medical need . Investigators recently report promising clinical activity anti-CTLA-4 mAb tremelimumab pre-treated MM patient : disease control rate ( DCR ) 31 % , survival rate 1- 2-years 48.3 % 36.7 % , respectively . These initial finding corroborate second study , base retrospective pharmacokinetic analysis , intensified schedule tremelimumab utilized . Fifty-two % patient achieve DCR ( median duration 10.9 month ) . These intriguing clinical result emerge efficacy immunomodulatory mAb target PD-1/PD-L1 axis different tumor type , prompt u design NIBIT-MESO-1 study aim investigate efficacy tremelimumab combine anti-PD-L1 MEDI4736 MM patient .</detailed_description>
