	<brief_title>Comprehensive Post-Acute Stroke Services</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Stroke mortality 20-40 % high North Carolina ( NC ) overall United States . After discharge , stroke patient high risk complication . Although model stroke post-care ( early support discharge ) exist Europe Canada , adapt tested US , although patient stakeholder attest post-acute care meet need . Transitional care service hospital home reimburse Centers Medicaid Medicare Services ( CMS ) , 30 day discharge . The study team propose pragmatic , cluster randomize trial 50 NC hospital determine effectiveness COMprehensive Post-Acute Stroke Services ( COMPASS ) , patient-centered intervention unite transitional care management service elements early support discharge stroke patient discharge directly home . The study team build successful North Carolina Stroke Care Collaborative ( NCSCC ) registry , prospective stroke database 51 ( 113 ) hospital NC enroll patient . In preparation COMPASS , study team engage hospital via webinars . Over 80 % NCSCC hospital demonstrate interest participation provide letter support . The main question pragmatic trial : Does implementation COMPASS stroke patient discharge directly home improve functional outcome measure Stroke Impact Scale-16 ( SIS-16 ) 90 day post stroke ? The primary aim : compare COMPASS model versus usual care stroke survivor ' self-reported functional status 90 day post-stroke . The secondary aim determine COMPASS model : 1 ) reduces caregiver strain ( Modified Caregiver Strain Index , MCSI ) 90 day post-stroke ; 2 ) reduce all-cause 30- 90-day readmission ; 3 ) affect mortality , health care use , continuity care , use transitional care management billing code , use claim data one year stroke hospitalization ; 4 ) differentially affect primary secondary outcome race , sex , age , stroke severity , insurance status . Patients age 18 admit NCSCC hospital diagnosis ischemic hemorrhagic stroke transient ischemic attack discharge acute care hospitalization home include ( 6,000 patients/year ) . NCSCC participate hospital randomize ( stratified stroke volume primary stroke center status ) receive COMPASS usual care ( control group ) Phase 1 . In Phase 2 , usual care hospital cross COMPASS , early intervention hospital sustain intervention use hospital-based resource . The trial three integrate intervention component : 1 ) COMPASS , combine transitional care service provide advanced practice provider ( APPs ) early support discharge service coordinate Post-Acute Coordinators ( PAC ) ; 2 ) COMPASS-funded post-acute care coordinator engage patient stakeholder community improve post-acute stroke comprehensive stroke service ; 3 ) development stroke metric score card NCSCC hospital primary care provider . Well-trained APPs coordinator access online learn ongoing support/consultation WFBH personnel board-certified vascular neurologist . The study team ass 90-day 1-year outcome . Outcomes 90-days assessed telephone surveyor blind patient 's group assignment . Patients informed COMPASS hospital , opt 90-day phone follow-up time . Those agree survey ask provide inform consent 90 day phone call collect outcomes data link data claim . The primary outcome patient-reported functional status ( SIS-16 ) . Secondary outcomes 90 day include : caregiver stress ( MCSI ) ; unadjusted 30- 90-day all-cause readmission capture via claim data ; proportion patient 7- 14-day post-stroke hospitalization ; mortality ; continuity care ; use transitional care management billing code ; medication adherence ; health care use ( emergency department visit , number hospital admission inpatient day , admission skilled nursing inpatient rehabilitation facility ) . Tertiary analysis include : cognitive status ; blood pressure management ; depression ; use community resource ; recurrent stroke ; physician follow-up . As primary endpoint continuous variable , study team use mixed model ( include fix random effect ) compare COMPASS control . The intraclass correlation , œÅ , obtain data collect eligible NCSCC hospital , estimate 0.036 base preliminary data . Conservatively double 0.072 90 % power detect 0.259 standard deviation difference COMPASS control group outcomes interest . Additionally , 90 % power detect 0.305 SD difference subgroup least 20 % overall sample . This proposal lead three highly experienced researcher co-principal investigator . The team include expertise stroke care , large clinical trial , biostatistics , manage clinical registry , survey acquisition patient proxy-reported outcome , community-based practice improvement , build community coalition reduce readmission , claim analysis , registry management , translate evidence practice large multi-site collaboratives , engage patient stakeholder research . The planning phase project guide patient stakeholder . Each community form coalition advise support implementation COMPASS , provide feedback team , help create sustainability . If COMPASS model show effectiveness , engage patient stakeholder key partner disseminate implement COMPASS throughout state beyond .</detailed_description>
