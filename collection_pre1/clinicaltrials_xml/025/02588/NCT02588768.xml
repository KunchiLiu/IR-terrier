	<brief_summary>Background/Aim : While grow evidence support use photobiomodulation therapy ( PBMT ) performance recovery enhancement , laboratory-controlled study . Therefore , aim study analyze effect PBMT performance recovery high-level rugby player anaerobic field test . Methods : It randomize , crossover , double-blinded , placebo-controlled trial . Twelve male high-level rugby athlete recruit study . No intervention perform Bangsbo Sprint Test ( BST ) familiarization phase ( week 1 ) . At week 2 3 , pre-exercise PBMT placebo randomly apply athlete . PBMT/placebo irradiation perform 17 site low limb , employ cluster 12 diode ( 4 laser diode 905nm , 4 LED diode 875nm , 4 LED diode 640nm , 30J per site - manufacture Multi Radiance Medical™ ) . Average time sprint , best time sprint , fatigue index obtain BST . Blood lactate level assess baseline , 3 , 10 , 30 60 minute BST . Athletes ' perceive fatigue also assess questionnaire .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Photobiomodulation Therapy Field Test With High-level Rugby Players</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>All exercise test conduct enclosed soccer/rugby field . The three test phase , administer one week apart , perform day week ( Tuesday ) time ( 1-5pm ) . The average temperature inside building trial range 26°C 28°C . At first stage ( exercise test 1 ) athlete perform Bangsbo Sprint Test ( BST ) familiarization procedure . No intervention comparators apply test . However , second third stage ( exercise test 2 3 , respectively ) either placebo active PBMT apply accord randomization . Blood sample collect athlete 's fingertip prior stretch warming-up ( baseline ) , 3 , 10 , 30 60 minute BST three study stages/phase ( exercise test ) . After blood sample collection ( establish baseline ) , warm-up comprise low-intensity activity dynamic stretch low-intensity short running perform athlete . Following warm-up cool period , either active placebo comparator apply athlete accord randomization procedure second test . For third test , comparator utilize complete cross design . A quick perception fatigue survey administer following test .</detailed_description>
