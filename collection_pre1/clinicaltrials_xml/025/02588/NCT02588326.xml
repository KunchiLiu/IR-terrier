	<brief_summary>Currently FDA accept pharmacokinetic study show bioequivalence locally-acting nasal suspension formulation . However , bioequivalence define absence significant difference pharmacokinetics therapeutically equivalent drug product compare match originally invent drug formulation . These there-called `` generic drug '' interchangeable . Drug company show generic version active ingredient , label , intend use condition disease work rate body . The aim study determine pharmacokinetics sensitive difference particle size distribution three different nasal suspension formulation mometasone furoate charcoal block . The result study aid FDA find method ensure generic product trade name drug .</brief_summary>
