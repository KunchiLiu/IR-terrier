	<brief_summary>The current study double blind randomise control trial compare radiofrequency ablation ( RFA ) versus conventional surgery ( CS ) patient serve control intact great saphenous vein ( GSVs ) .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Radiofrequency Ablation v Conventional Surgery Superficial Venous Insufficiency</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Individuals symptomatic varicose vein bilateral GSV insufficiency confirm duplex ultrasound examination candidate conventional vein strip eligible inclusion study . A total 18 patient enter trial . As per protocol , patient treat RFA one leg CS contralateral limb . Randomisation perform preoperatively use randomisation table . Patients advise treatment allocation order ensure trial carry blinded fashion . All operation perform regional anaesthesia surgical team , skilled management venous disease extensive expertise technique . Phlebectomy varicosities concomitantly perform . The independent observer physician involve original operation , patient , duplex ultrasonographer aware treatment perform case surgeon involve outcome assessment . CS . Patients underwent standard procedure cranial ligation GSV branch sapheno-femoral junction ( SFJ ) use groin crease incision strip GSV SFJ ankle level , use vein stripper bring small incision near medial malleolus . RFA . The procedure perform ultrasound guidance . The GSV proximal medial malleolus cannulate 7F sheath use surgical cutdown . The tip radiofrequency catheter place least 2 cm distal SFJ distal superficial epigastric vein orifice . Patients receive tumescent infiltration cold normal saline ( 0.9 % ) circumferentially around GSV within envelop fascia along entire length treat vein . This prevent nerve injury thermal injury skin . Then catheter gradually withdraw accord device manufacturer 's recommendation . The technique consist controlled segmental heating GSV , use catheter 7-cm heating element ( Closure™ system , VNUS Medical Technologies , Inc. , San Jose , California , USA ) . The temperature maintain 120° C per segment use standard time . The thermoablation continue catheter tip reach knee . Immediately follow treatment RFA , intraoperative ultrasound imaging use confirm shrinkage vein . For limbs operated radiofrequency technique , groin crease incision make similar contralateral side , manipulation SFJ . The incision proximal medial malleolus use sheath insertion . To ensure independent observer physician involve original operation , patient , duplex ultrasonographer make aware treatment do , incision perform leg .</detailed_description>
