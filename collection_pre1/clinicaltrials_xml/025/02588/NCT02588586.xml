	<brief_title>A Study Safety Antiretroviral Activity 3BNC117</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>The propose study Phase II , open label study evaluate safety , antiretroviral activity pharmacokinetics four infusion 3BNC117 HIV-infected individual combination ART brief analytical treatment interruption ( ATI ) . Study participant administer four intravenous infusion 3BNC117 , administer 30 mg/kg day 0 , week 12 , week 24 week 27 . Antiretroviral therapy discontinue 2 day third 3BNC117 infusion ( week 24 ) , week 36 . The ART regimen resume week 36 sooner plasma HIV-1 RNA level ≥ 200 copies/ml , CD4+ T cell count drop &lt; 350 cells/microliter , result confirm upon repeat measurement next weekly schedule visit . If plasma HIV-1 RNA level ≥ 1,000 copies/ml , participant ask return repeat measurement prior next scheduled visit , ART resume result confirm . ART also resume early participant become pregnant otherwise clinically indicate . If ART resume week 27 , fourth 3BNC117 infusion administer . Participants follow weekly analytical treatment interruption phase safety assessment monitor plasma HIV-1 RNA level . CD4+ T cell count monitor every 2 week analytical treatment interruption phase . Participants may remain antiretroviral therapy week 36 , weekly viral load monitoring , viral rebound occur week 36 . All participant follow total 60 week enrollment .</detailed_description>
