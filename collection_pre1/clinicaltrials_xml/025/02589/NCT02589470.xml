	<brief_title>COMETE Study : COgnitive Rehabilitation MEmory Temporal Epilepsy</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Epilepsy chronic neurological disease among frequent one . It cause cognitive disorder 20 50 percent patient structural epilepsy , say connexion identify presumed cerebral lesion . Compared seizure , cognitive disorder major additional factor professional , social family disability . They particularly prevalent ( 50 % ) temporal lobe epilepsy preferentially affect language memory ability . These disorder well describe , multifactorial ( drug and/or non drug ) therapy validate yet . Recently , technique cognitive rehabilitation show benefit neurological disease , like multiple sclerosis . Concerning adulthood epilepsy , cognitive rehabilitation study conduct present huge methodological gap limit scope result . Studies cognitive function highlight promising result concern attention . In contrast , field memory , single cohort study carry , randomise , non comparable group , significant outcome therefore balance . Thus , study , patient focal structural temporal lobe epilepsy randomise 2 group : COMETE group patient attend specific rehabilitation programme memory control group patient benefit standard treatment . Work 's hypothesis would patient undergo rehabilitation programme would present improved learning ability ( impact memory performance ) compare patient standard treatment . This hypothesis base underlying theory cognitive rehabilitation . This method predict reinforce cognitive ability transfer others , improve learning ability also result improved ability immediate memory , work memory , effect verbal inhibition ability , constitute specific marker/indicator ? intervention . Moreover , patient care may impact quality life mood predictive factor good social professional integration : 's indexes/criteria measure .</detailed_description>
