	<brief_summary>Amputation limb may result trauma surgical intervention . The amputation traumatically alter body image , often leave sensation refer miss body part . In 50-80 % amputee , neuropathic pain develops , also call phantom limb pain ( PLP ) . Both peripheral central nervous system factor implicate determinant PLP . Also , PLP may trigger physical ( change weather ) psychological factor ( emotional stress ) . Recent evidence suggest PLP may intricately relate neuroplastic change cortex , change may modulate provide sensory input stump amputation zone . A non-invasive clinical trial test effectiveness non-invasive pressure sensory feedback build hand prosthesis alleviate phantom limb pain .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Phantom Limb Pain : Efficacy Non-invasive Sensory Feedback Through Prosthesis</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>During pre-screen phase investigator assess whether patient experience refer phantom limb sensation pain . In case patient experience refer sensation stump investigator map area sensation occur stump utilize placement surface actuator . In opposite case , actuator instead place matrix structure residual limb . As first step towards apply mechanical stimulation , sensation threshold ( level stimulation subject first report sensation ) determine . The outcome procedure minimum stimulation amplitude apply stimulation site . A first choice would use referred map place actuator . However , amputee different phantom map also number area varies . A therapy define base use sensory feedback system integrate amputee hand prosthesis . The subject use hand prosthesis , sensory feedback , duration minimum 2 h per day 4 week period . Preferably , system use actively normal daily activity .</detailed_description>
