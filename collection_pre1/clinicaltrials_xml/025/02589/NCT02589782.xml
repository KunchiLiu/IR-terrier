	<detailed_description>This multi-centre , open label , multi-arm , randomise , control , phase II-III trial ; evaluate short treatment regimen contain bedaquiline pretomanid combination exist re-purposed anti-TB drug treatment biologically confirm pulmonary multidrug-resistant TB ( MDR-TB ) . The study divide two stage , seamless transition stage , mean recruitment arm stop decision take follow stage 1 primary end point data analysis . All recruit patient follow 108 week post randomisation unless die withdraw consent . The local standard care ( SOC ) MDR-TB regimen use internal control safety efficacy . The first stage corresponds Phase II trial safety preliminary efficacy patient MDR-TB . Patients recruit 3 parallel B Pa contain regimen arm plus SOC control . The main objective Stage 1 select drug regimens evaluation Stage 2 base 8 week safety efficacy endpoint . All stage 1 patient hospitalise 8 week intensive cardiological evaluation establish QT-specific liability regimen . Investigational arm meet predefined safety efficacy criterion ( percentage culture conversion &gt; 40 % ; percentage discontinuation death &lt; 45 % ) consider evaluation . The regimens meet pre-defined safety and/or efficacy criterion eligible evaluate long term safety , tolerability efficacy Stage 2 . If less two investigational arm available stage two assessment , SAC make recommendation whether new arm introduce study . If two arm available Stage 2 assessment , two regimen choose . The SAC make recommendation two arm take forward trial steer committee . The second stage corresponds phase III trial . Patients stage recruit 2 arm choose stage 1 plus SOC . The regimen primarily evaluate safety efficacy comparison SOC arm 72 week post randomisation . The primary efficacy outcome composite endpoint percentage unfavourable outcome . The secondary outcome include safety outcome particular percentage Grade 3 4 AEs SAEs investigational regimen compare SOC .</detailed_description>
