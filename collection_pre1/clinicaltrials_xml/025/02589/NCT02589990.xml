	<brief_summary>The study investigate effect maximal strength training muscular strength power different age group 20 80 year old . It also relate train adaptation different know gene angiotensin I-converting enzyme ( ACE ) Alpha-actinin-3 ( ACTN3 ) . Participants complete eight week , three time per week training intervention maximal strength train pre-post design . In addition , blood sample collect analysis genetic variance .</brief_summary>

	<detailed_description>Aim : The study aim investigate effect age gene train adaptation maximal strength training intervention . Methods : Participants recruit invitation work place community arenas . The investigator aim recruit 10-15 subject follow age group : 20-29 , 30-39 , 40-49 , 50-59 , 60-69 70-80 year age . Both gender include . All age group match age-related baseline maximal strength distribution two gender . All participant check via health registration scheme , exclude contra indication hard physical training test appear . When doubt , project physician decide inclusion exclusion due thorough examination . Subjects give blood sample analyze know gene ACE ACTN3 . The intervention pre- post design . Tests maximal strength power conduct leg-press machine , use protocol assess one repetition maximum ( 1RM ) previously describe . Force Power measure Muscle Lab system Ergotest Tech . ( Langesund , Norway ) . The intervention eight week , three time per week protocol , train session consist standardized warm-up , 4 repetition x 4 set intensity 4 repetition maximum ( 4RM ) perform leg press machine.There three minute pause set . Participants give instruction supervision . Hypothesis : Maximal strength training adaptation affect age baseline maximal strength gender genetic variation .</detailed_description>
