	<brief_title>Fish Nuts ? Dietary Effects Cardiometabolic Risk Factors Persistent Organic Pollutants</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Today one-fifth adult Norwegian population obese , prevalence abdominal obesity increase disproportionately woman . Cardiometabolic disorder ( metabolic syndrome , type 2 diabetes ) follow wake obesity increase health burden population . Persistent organic pollutant ( POPs ) lipophilic chemical like dioxin , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , organochlorine pesticide ( OPs ) bioaccumulate live organisms many year . In human POPs mainly store adipose tissue , chemical detect plasma population , include baby . Humans mainly expose POPs consumption fatty rich food , high level POPs present fatty fish . Because presence polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acid , eat fatty fish generally associate good health outcome . However , question arise whether POPs pollutant impair nutritional benefit fish ( 5 ) . Dietary modification major cornerstone prevention treatment obesity cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) . Evidence link Mediterranean diet prevention CVD sustain weight loss . The Mediterranean diet consume traditionally consist bread , legumes , vegetable fruit , nut , olive oil , limit red meat , meat product , butter , hard margarine sugar well moderate alcohol intake . Acceptance feasibility Mediterranean diet limit non-Mediterranean country certain group require modification accord local culture norm . In Norway , official dietary recommendation advise population eat lot vegetable , fruit , berry , whole grain , legume , nut fish process red meat , salt sugar limit ( 11 ) . Nuts powerhouse protein , fiber , unsaturated fatty acid include n-3 fatty acid phytochemical , easy incorporate diet . Evidence link nut reduce rate CVD overweight . Dietary recommendation likely reduce CVD risk patient overweight obesity controversial . If eating fatty fish regularly worsen metabolic regulation , alternative fatty fish may eat nut . This study aim clarify effect eat fatty fish compare nut cardiovascular risk factor level POPs patient overweight obesity risk CVD . 2.0 Insulin resistance tightly relate abdominal obesity accompany host change cardiometabolic risk factor include low HDL cholesterol , high triglyceride , subclinical inflammation ( show high CRP ) , disturbances lead CVD . Other characteristic include high level adipokines ( leptin , visfatin ) decrease adiponectin , insulin-sensitizing hormone . Clinically presence three five risk factor , namely abdominal obesity , low HDL cholesterol , high triglyceride , high fasting glucose , high blood pressure , characterize metabolic syndrome . Insulin resistance measure precisely hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp method , method time consume apply limited sample . Clinically , insulin resistance suggest high C-peptide . The Homeostasis Model Assessment index calculate estimate insulin resistance ( HOMA-IR ) use fast glucose insulin level . 3.1 Obesity POPs Factors affect homeostasis POPs store adipose tissue circulate blood concentration clear . Both high low POP level report obese versus lean individual . These association may differ accord compound previous exposure . Less chlorinate PCBs , dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene ( DDE ) dioxin show adjust odds ratio 2-3 abdominal obesity data senior . Because study mostly cross-sectional , obtain data weight change retrospectively , causation POP level obesity remain speculative . Weight loss reduces adipose tissue storage increase concentration blood short term , though drastic weight loss decrease total body burden . 3.3 Farmed fish source POPs - study Norway A much cite study publish 2004 found farm salmon significantly high POP burden wild salmon farm salmon Europe significantly contaminate farmed salmon South North America . Since time , level POPs like dioxin likely decrease , current aquaculture feed increasingly base plant oil . However , contaminant like OPs polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( PAH ) , omnipresent vegetable oil , largely present farm fish . Recently , significant amount POPs report remain Norwegian salmon . Importantly , proportion n-3 fatty acid decrease 50 % . High level POPs show coastal Norwegian population , well association marine food consumption concentration POPs ( 26 , 27 ) . Further study show oily fish main source PCBs dioxins high population-representative fish consumer Norway . Clear correlation show estimated intake blood concentration POPs . 4.1 Nuts CVD Systematic review meta-analyses conduct recent year strongly support protective association eat nut CVD . Three meta-analyses appear 2014 . Studies find nut intake inversely associate ischemic heart disease , overall CVD all-cause mortality significantly associate diabetes stroke . There found inverse association eat nut incident ischemic heart disease diabetes stroke . It find linear dose-response relationship nut consumption coronary artery disease ( CAD ) risk , risk CAD decrease 5 % every serving/week . Randomized dietary trial provide experimental evidence support protective effect nut CVD . Participants age 55 80 year high risk CVD randomly assign one three dietary intervention : Mediterranean diet supplement virgin olive oil nut ( approximately 30 g/day mixed nut ) , low-fat diet . The primary end point rate major cardiovascular event ( myocardial infarction , stroke , death cardiovascular cause ) median follow-up 4.8 year . The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio group assign Mediterranean diet nut 0.72 versus control group . 4.2 Nuts body weight Though nut energy dense food , eat nut appear associate increased body weight . Meta-analysis conducted 2013 find 33 relevant clinical trial nut intake provide outcome body weight . Compared control diet , diet enrich nuts increase body weight , BMI waist circumference . The effect nut energy summarize lately . Nuts characterize high satiety value lead strong compensatory dietary response , inefficiency absorption energy contain augmentation fat oxidation . 4.3 Nuts cardiometabolic risk factor A number mechanism examine experimental study provide putative explanation protective effect nuts CVD . Effects show primarily walnut , hazelnut , almonds pistachio . Eating walnuts show improved endothelial function overweight adult visceral obesity . Mediterranean diet supplement olive oil nut reduce 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure , total cholesterol fast glucose reverse metabolic syndrome shift lipoprotein subfractions less atherogenic pattern . Diets enrich hazelnut improve endothelial function , prevent LDL oxidation lower inflammatory marker addition lipid-lowering effect . Nuts could alternative fatty fish diet , person wish eat vegetarian diet , wish avoid contaminant , improve CVD risk factor person high risk . However , unaware study compare CVD risk factor diet include nut versus fatty fish . 5.0 Objectives study main hypothesis 1. control group consume nut fatty fish 2. group consume fatty fish Hypotheses : 1 . The investigator hypothesize consumption fatty fish increase level POPs overweight obese norwegian men woman . 2 . The investigator hypothesize consumption fatty fish change marker cardiometabolic risk overweight obese norwegian men woman . 3 . The investigator hypothesize consumption nut improve marker cardiometabolic risk overweight obese norwegian men woman compare control group consume nut group consume fatty fish . Variables , follow-up endpoint : Clinic visit schedule biweekly interval first 12 week ensure stability body weight group compliance . Vital sign weight measure visit standardize manner . A subsample 15 participant fish , nut control group undergo hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp evaluation insulin sensitivity resistance baseline three month . For POPs analyse sample frozen -70 degree Celsius analyze batchwise follow 21 POPs , suspect strongly act endocrine metabolic disruptors:14 PCBs , include dioxin-like PCBs non-dioxin-like PCBs , 5 , 2,2',4,4'-tetra-bromobiphenyl ether 1 dioxin . Power : Similar study current one perform previously help calculation sample size , however , attempt . In six-month period possibly clinically relevant change POPs may 15-20 % increase - also difference PCBs representative high consumer Norway ( 29 ) . The study include 40 participant group allow dropout total 120 participant . Clinical significance study : If increase POP level see , correlate cardiometabolic risk , may indicate need look causal relation POPs cardiometabolic disease risk factor particularly type 2 diabetes . If eating fatty fish promote cardiometabolic risk , may indicate need reevaluate current dietary recommendation . If eating nut improve CVD risk factor compare eat nut , eat fatty fish , could important dietary information population high risk CVD . 4.3 Statistical analysis The statistical analysis follow intent-to-treat principle , additional complementary analysis per protocol population . Data analysis change POPs CVD risk factor comprise randomize individual complete 12-week first study phase ( intention treat analysis - primary outcome ) . This analysis repeat include per protocol participant record 80 % compliance assign food ( completer analysis - secondary outcome ) . Between group comparison change POPs CVD risk factor perform use independent sample t-test . The study compare fish group control , nut group . Within-group comparison perform use pair t-test . P-values &lt; 0.05 consider statistically significant .</detailed_description>
