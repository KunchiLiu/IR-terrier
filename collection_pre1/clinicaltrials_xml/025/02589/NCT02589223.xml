	<brief_summary>St. Michael 's Hospital ( SMH ) provide service individual severe brain injury intensive care need Canada . These patient often require prolonged intensive care admission , lengthy hospital stay , involvement many health professional , long-term support ongoing care requirement . Many hospital face resource limitation , specifically involve health discipline ability provide frequent intervention . It propose multisensory stimulation ( i.e . expose patient various sight , sound , smell , etc . ) early stage brain injury recovery may result improved responsiveness/cognitive function . Previous research indicate potential benefit early multisensory stimulation intervention patient severe brain injury . However still enough conclusive evidence confirm whether intervention truly effective . The investigator propose pilot randomize control study ( placebo-controlled , double-blinded ) determine feasibility examine effectiveness early multisensory stimulation patient follow severe brain injury remain coma , vegetative state , minimally conscious state . Eligible patient randomize control group ( standard care + family/caregiver education ) intervention group ( standard care + family/caregiver education + early sensory intervention ) . Data regard number patient enrol , amount intervention complete , percentage outcome data collect , patient 's level responsiveness cognitive function collect intervention period , use several outcome measure . The investigator hope determine feasibility conduct type study within clinical set effectiveness multisensory stimulation patient population .</brief_summary>
