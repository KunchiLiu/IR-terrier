	<brief_summary>The Nucleus 24 Auditory Brainstem Implant ( ABI ) FDA approve device restoration meaningful hearing Neurofibromatosis Type 2 ( NF2 ) patient . This device discontinue , mean commercially approve device currently available . The replacement model , ABI541 ( unapproved device ) , investigate ongoing clinical trial . A compassionate use arm clinical trial allow patient NF2 implant new ABI .</brief_summary>
	<brief_title>Compassionate Use Arm - ABI541 ABI 10 NF2 Patients</brief_title>
	<detailed_description>Currently , Nucleus 24 ( ABI24M ) Auditory Brainstem Implant ( ABI ) approve use individual 12 year age old diagnose Neurofibromatosis Type 2 ( NF2 ) . Implantation may occur first second side tumor removal patient previously remove vestibular schwannomas bilaterally . As ABI24M obsolete , currently commercially approve device available restore useful hearing patient . While manufacturer device pursue commercial approval ABI541 , anticipate may several month year final approval . However , preferable place device time tumor removal patient open craniotomy site , thereby avoid second surgery associate risk solely purpose device implantation . In addition , placement ABI time tumor removal optimize auditory rehabilitation , provide critical auditory sensation may effectively maintain auditory pathway . The FDA approve compassionate use arm ongoing clinical trial permit implantation ABI541 10 NF2 patient . Patients undergo pre-operative evaluation ABI surgery . Those appropriate surgery undergo procedure implantation ABI541 . As per manufacturer protocol , parameter ABI541 include adjustment electrode sensitivity activation specific electrode complete follow-up visit post-operatively . This process involve adjustment device parameter train audiologist subsequently administer audiologic test confirm optimal activation ABI541 . All audiologic test assessment represent standard care . These post-operative follow-up appointment occur 4-12 week , three , six , twelve month , biannually thereafter . Timing appointment may vary much four week prior plan follow-up date ( e.g . 2-4 month 3 month follow-up ) . Unscheduled visit take Otology clinic need address concern patient may regard use Nucleus ABI541 .</detailed_description>
